true,keizersozei,flair5,,"This is a very important point. Kaboul (Like Dawson until last year) suffers from needing to be the less experienced CB. So he will perform incredibly when partnered with Gallas or King. The understanding/relationship that the 2 CB's in a team have is more important than any other understanding between 2 players anywhere else on the pitch. I don't know if this is done tactically, but often we've had one experienced CB playing alongside a less experienced CB. This inevitably means that the player with more experience will guide the younger player, while the younger player will follow orders. Lets not forget that Kaboul is only 26 which is pretty young for a CB.

We know his weakness is positioning, but he seems to have overcome this early on in the season. His strengths are his physical presence, and his ability to compete for an aerial duel. Concentrating on this USP, the 3 best competitors for aerial duels in the premier league are Crouch - 4.5 won per game, Kaboul 3.9, and Carroll 3.8. Carroll and Crouch are a couple of the tallest players in the country and are also strikers who play in systems where their team mates lump the ball up front looking for one of them to outjump the defender. i.e. the ball is played to their heads deliberately. Kaboul on the other hand is a defender - which (on the whole) means that the ball often is intended for someone else, yet he gets the better of them. Seeing this statistic play out in real time is astonishing, and I think THIS is Kaboul's consistent strength that would deem him worthy of defensive comparisons with the world's best. 

Pretty prolific as a CB as well which doesn't hurt. ",0,1333468621,null,0,false,0,c480978,t3_rqr0q,t1_c480978,t1_c47y38k,null,1428647353,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

I feel Javi Martinez may end up going to a team that will give him Champions League so we're way behind on most other teams that are interested in him. Would love it if we got Moutinho would be a quality addition to the squad.

I think we have a very strong chance of landing Hoilett this summer and tbh I think we would be foolish to pass him up he's like a more consistent Babel which can really bring something to the team. 

I'm very unsure about De jong, I haven't seen nearly enough of him to say yes lets get this guy but I've got a nagging feeling that if we miss out on him and he he goes anywhere else in the premiership he'll bang them in for fun, It's time we do take a punt on some young bright sparks as we're not in a position to bring in a a world class goal scorer atm. 

Baring that in mind I would love to see us try and pinch

1. This subreddit is definitely would of the best I've been on and is certainly one of my favorites. The mods do an excellent job of making this place run smoothly and they should all be thanked for that. 

2. I've often wondered exactly what the guidelines/rules regarding posts are on this subreddit. And considering that it's a bit unclear, I think we've been in a very fortunate situation so far, in that we don't have to deal with some of the horrible crap that gets posted elsewhere. (I am not a mod, and thus don't see what gets reported and all the jazz) But from what I'm seeing, I think we have a smart enough community to handle ourselves. At least until someone goes and fucks it up for everyone. What I'm trying to say, is that I think posts like these should be allowed, as long as they are clearly marked NSFW (even if its just a bit questionable, better to tag than not). There is a fine line though, but judging from submissions I've seen, I think we're a ways away from dealing with that issue. 

3. As for my posts, I try to look at what we're discussing through out various threads and pull on those things to combine threads and focus discuss. I also try to post funny things I see (or think of; hence why I posted a picture of my guinea pig to cheer people up when things were looking down) that are Chelsea related.

* Whether or not people have become tax exiles in response to a tax tells us nothing about whether that tax results in net increase or decrease to government revenue.

The points isn't whether you are right or wrong about tax exiles (and at this point we've no evidence to decide either way (and no, a list of celebs on wikipedia is not sufficient evidence)) - it's that the point is *irrelevant*.

You also haven't provided any evidence about 'taxing the rich' doesn't work. I agree 100% that the top 1% provide a greater proportion of tax income now then in 1979, but that tells us nothing about whether 'taxing the rich' works or not without, e.g., investigation of whether society is more or less unequal now. Again, the supposed fact is useless without further claims.

The issue here is really one of basic logic - you're making various claims which are more or less plausible, but you're failing to turn them into arguments against the substantive point I bullet-pointed above.

&gt;After reading Private Eye for a number of years, to me most newspapers are tabloids. 

You should take the Eye with a pinch of salt too. It's easy to console oneself of one's intellectual superiority by taking on the affected air of world-weariness which the Eye plays nicely too.

I suppose you could consider it a backdoor, but physical access to a running computer means that, eventually, it will be compromised. It's even easier to do this via firewire without any MS help.

I admit I had forgotten about the RIM &amp; Apple thing, but I was mainly talking about desktop OS rather than mobile / cell - which are assumed to be unsafe within the industry.

It's not that I am trusting these things not to have backdoors, it's just that having a backdoor is like having an extra hole in a block of swiss cheese, it makes no difference whatsoever. If someone wants to get in, they can get in to almost anything. This is especially true of physical access.

Ultimately, yes, the rule-of-thumb is not to trust anything you can't audit completely - which rules out almost all the technology we use on a daily basis. However, a deliberate remote backdoor is a business liability that a lot of companies, at least the ones I have worked with, will not accept. 

Good luck to RIM and Apple, though. If they have installed backdoors and there is widespread abuse of those backdoors, they will be finished in that market. Your point about Huawei backs me up on that one, one article points out:

""and in this case we are dealing with a company, Huawei, which would be risking billions of dollars by introducing a backdoor in its devices.""

Linking to unauthorised copyrighted content. Technically, that means fifteen year old Susie can be sent to the US by this joke-of-a-Home Secretary just because she linked a YouTube video containing unauthorised copyrighted content on her Facebook wall.

To be honest, you shouldn't even trust things you can audit.

Ken Tompson's seminal paper on Trusting Trust introduced the concept of backdooring C compilers in an undetectable way (due to the way compilers have to bootstrap by being compiled by compilers). So even if you had the current sourcecode for the compiler you wouldn't be able to detect the trojan.

http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf

Regarding hardware, the Chinese were caught selling counterfeit Cisco router copies with backdoors in them to the US military.

So even if it's not backdoors in hardware/software from ""friendly"" governments there is also the issue of backdoors from other governments.

Certainly enough for US researchers to point out that the current battle is low in the application stack

Most of that from oil revenue, as you well know, and the SNP is working to secure *all* of that money for use in solely in Scotland. Individually, you're not paying additional tax for the added services you are getting, you're effectively spending oil revenue funds denied to the rest of the UK.. so, yeah ""for free"". 

&gt; Living in London, back-in-black will be able to take advantage of the new £4bn upgrade to London's sewage system. 

I love the spin here. When you say ""take advantage of"", I suppose what you mean is ""upgrade from collapsing Victorian sewage system which pumps shit into the Thames"". This is what was said about it in the Lords:

&gt; Defra Minister Lord Taylor said: “We believe that the circumstances that [water consumers in the south west of England] face are exceptional. For years they have faced the highest water bills in the country as they have paid the costs of the £2bn invested in infrastructure post-privatisation. The benefits of this investment include improved water quality, reduced leakage, cleaner beaches and better bathing water, but the costs have been borne solely by South West Water customers and their bills have risen as a result. We believe that the Government should help to correct the historical inequity. We do not want another such inequity to arise.

&gt; “London’s sewerage system is operating close to capacity – and the situation will only get worse with population growth, urbanisation and climate change. Even after construction of the Lee tunnel and improvements to sewage treatment works, around 20 million tonnes of untreated wastewater will still be discharged in a typical year from combined sewer overflows into the Thames. This is unacceptable on environmental and health grounds, and it needs addressing.”

You're only option is to set yourself up as a business and pay tax through self assessment at the end of the year.

You can get paid through PAYE if you are a banker and you only work for one company all year at a set wage.

Your tax avoidance is then because he is paying himself in dividends at the end of the year out of the money in the company rather than through wages.

Metallic teeth begin their grind

With sword of truth I turn to fight

* [Vikings Punter is a redditor and has done an AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/r5bay/chris_kluwe_ama/). Plays warcraft too. Funny guy. If you haven't checked it out, its pretty amazing.

* [Sex Boat Scandal](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/vikings-charged-bawdy-boat-case) Pretty much rented a boat with hookers and coke. Not as bad as the mid 90's Dallas Cowboys crack house but still. Damn you Fred Smoot.

* [Brett Favre Saga](http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4406963) This was an absurd period for American sports media. Everyday we got ""FAVRE WATCH!!!!"" on ESPN. Pictures of him on his tractor in Mississippi or throwing football to high school kids.

* [Best Offensive Player, Adrian Peterson, Gets Potentially Career Ending Injury](http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7459525/minnesota-vikings-adrian-peterson-begins-rehabbing-injured-left-knee) And this combined with the fact that they did not top 2 pick this year (QB being the most important position in the NFL and this year there are only 2 consensus franchise QBs in the draft: Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin III) means that the Vikings have a steep uphill climb.

Having adopted Everton as my team because of the underdog qualities, 2 best Americans playing on the squad, the wholesomeness/loyalty of the fanbase, and the well coached but poorly owned nature of the club, I think the Vikings would be an interesting team to adopt.

The strongest memories I have of the Vikings are of a time when they had a dominant passing attack with Dante Culpepper, Randy Moss, and Chris Carter. During those years, they were a Super Bowl contender. The EPL seems to have the top 4ish stay the top 4ish until they get an influx of cash or they lose out on money. The turnover in the NFL is staggering. Every year, half of the teams in the playoffs are new.

It is an attempt to transform the established social order and its structures of power, authority, and hierarchy to the lobbyist's end.  Corporation is not the worst form of lobbying, social engineering lobbyists are the most dangerous.  Lets look at the direction the UK is going, sustainability.  We are being trained to think that we as people are bad and need to reduce our carbon footprint.  Agenda 21 the UN's plan for the world which we are signed on to is the driving force that is undermining our families, our economies, our belief systems.  A nice little propaganda film on the cities of the future put out by forum for the future illustrates the direction we are headed.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7rCAYkoMT0&amp;feature=related

In this film we will notice that we will be crammed into mega cities, have no free choice on what we do for a living, you will not be able to travel freely, you will have no choice on where your children will go to school, there will be a global food council that dictates what you will eat, only the rich will have cars: so even though such things exist you just wont be able to have one, people will not be allowed to congregate and all your socializing will be done via technology which of course will be monitored.  If you don't like this Utopia then you will be herded like cattle into ghettos and cut off from society.

You might think this is crazy talk, but look to our cousins over the pond.  They are doing away with property rights, and big firms are being contracted to build these mega cities, most of the US will be designated wildlife reserve and no one will be able to live there at all.  All previously owned industrial lands are being bought up and turned into park land so that it will be impossible to industrialize the nation again and forcing people out of rural areas into cities.  They have already foreclosed on many people's homes, attacked local farms and co-ops, shanty towns are popping up all over the place, and we are starting to see the same trend here in Europe.  Spain, Greece, Portugal, France and even Germany.  

Do you think Citizens would agree with the policies and laws being imposed that are bringing all this about?  Then were are they coming from?  Lobbyist's.

They also have nothing to gain by making the LDs more popular- the more unpopular they are, the more they are tied to the coalition in the hope of a long-term recovery.

To add to that, the idea that the Tories could just say ""Well fine, we won't do it, it was Labour's idea anyway"" is ludicrous.

Not to mention that Clegg has already come out in support of the policy. Is the plan that he will be able to trumpet defeating himself?

Firstly: an IP address is not a person. If a warrant is obtained to tap communications from an IP at, say, a coffee shop, other people will be subject to warrantless wiretaps, or the warrants issued will have to explicitly target innocent people.

Secondly: there's no correlation between a connection and consumption. Embed images for jihadfordummies.net and everyone viewing the email/web page that embeds them will look like they're viewing extremist material. Beyond that if you trick one person to doing that, will warrants be sought for every IP they've communicated with? What about IPs that spoke with those? And so on?

On top of these issues, the crux is that I think that warrants will be issued with too little evidence.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; Especially seen as without this measure, there has only been 52 deaths relating to terrorism in the last 7 years. There was 156,090 deaths from cancer in 2009 alone.

This is the nub of the issue. Terrorism just isn't that much of a threat, and the money and effort could be spent elsewhere to much greater effect. The only reason there's so much attention on terrorism is that it is a media event, which allows politicians to make square jawed speeches full of patriotic fervour and defiance. Nobody cares very much about the 100 people in Britain who will die today of lung cancer, which is why we spend £20m a year on researching treatments. In comparison, 50 people have died in the last decade from terrorism, and the Afghanistan invasion alone cost £11,000m*, to say nothing of Iraq, or the redirection of Security Service and police funds, or the cost of monitoring the entire nation's internet access. To say nothing of the loss of civil liberties and the diminution of the dignity of the British state through indefinite detention without trial, involvement in 'rendition', or the same internet/communications database. We live in a sick society.

It's just shame that rather than more people voting Lib Dems next time to give them even more control and maybe be able to push more of their agenda, people are just going to focus on the fact that they didn't fulfil their promises, despite not actually winning in the first place, and go back to f-ing Labour.

Well *that* is interesting. I did not know that. I assumed it was higher because of all the promises Salmond was making with oil money. I suppose you got the figures from somewhere like [here](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Economy/GERS/Publications/GERS201011xls), which broadly agrees with your figures.

By extension, this means that a lot of Salmonds figures for an independent Scotland have to wrong. He said he could raise [£54 billion](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/mar/02/oil-revenues-if-scotland-became-independent) in 5 years through taxation (~10 billion a year?), which he couldn't *possibly* do running a country that started out on a ~10% deficit, even including £15 billion in oil revenue (the high mark for oil revenue to date). 

&gt; I don't deny it needs upgrading - however UK government spending on English projects is meant to trigger a proportional increase to Wales/Scotland ... That the sewage system of a major city might need upgrading shouldn't be a surprise, and it shouldn't be funded from money that was meant to be used for national projects.

Well the problem here are the phrases ""English projects"" and ""national projects"". Why is upgrading London sewers not a ""national project""? Why is an ""English project""? 

As you saw from the Lords quote, Londons sewers are a natural disaster waiting to happen. Is it your contention then that we must wait until *after* it is a disaster before the money from the fund can be released? Assuming you intend someone else to pay, who exactly do you think *should* pay to prevent this impending crisis? Taxpayers in the South East? Should living costs there be increased further? Should England as a whole pay? 

I don't think it's particularly unreasonable that the nation as a whole should pay for a long-overdue upgrade to a City that provides money and jobs, and tax revenue for the whole country. The insistence that this should trigger an ""increase in funds"" to Scotland and Wales seems strange, where would *that* money come from? Would it be borrowed? Would it come from a tax hike applied to England alone?

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"My friend responds:

Righty...have had a read, let's get down to it.

Firstly a quick note about Skaro - It's never stated when Skaro is destroyed. One of the Daleks on the bridge says that the Hand of Omega is travelling in time as it heads towards Skaro, so there's no reason to assume it doesn't get destroyed at some very far point in the future, and when the Master stands trial there, it could well have happened before the Hand impacted. Further, if you want to bring the expanded universe into play, then in War of the Daleks, it's made pretty clear that Sakro wasn't destroyed - in fact, Antalin was destroyed in a fiendish, yet ridiculously complicated plan by the Daleks to trick Davros into...err, well frankly, who knows what the Daleks plan was, but whatever it was it involved building the Movellans, terraforming Antalin into a copy of Skaro and getting Davros to destroy it. ....fucking John Peel...

Back on task then 

The Doctor has indeed said he can't go back into his own timestream and save himself, but as the universe is exploding around him, the rules start to change. It reminds me of a cartood in DWM once where the Doctor says ""Time Lords should never meet themselves unless it's of the most disastrous emergency...like anniversary specials."" Yes, the paradoxical solution seems like it should be used all the time, but the truth is, it is like the HADS. Useful to escape the Krotons weapons, but let's never speak of it again, especially in Frontios when we want the TARDIS pulled apart. I have the same problem with the ""invisible car"" in the Bond movie 'Die Another Day', so I am sypmathetic to the annoyance. However, I'm fairly certain the Doctor actually says something about the universe getting smaller and they are literally at the eye of the storm - extreme circumstances demand extreme measures. That's how they can get away with it this once, but just because it might be necessary to shoot an axe murderer who has entered your house, doesn't mean it should be the default response for every intruder. 

Also, one of the themes of the eleventh Doctor seems to be that history can indeed be rewritten. Now I'm not sure if I like this or not, but that said I'm still not sure if I like the fact that the Doctor is half-human on his mother's side .

So, RTD was indeed a believer that the universe was filled with diversity, but come on - he was a big one for monsters, was our Rusty. Autons, a menagerie of aliens, Geth, Slitheen, Daleks, Max, Reapers, Gas-Mask Zombies, more Slitheen, more Daleks, Sycorax, Cat-People, Werewolves, Krillitane, Clockword Droids, Cybermen, Faceless Zombies, Ood, Abzorbaloff, oh look Fear Her doesn't have a monster. Oh wait, it has that scribble thing. More Daleks &amp; Cybermen, Racnoss, Judoon, Carrionites, more Cat-People and the Macra (the Macra!!!), more Daleks, Lazarus, The Sun-Possessed, Jackstraws, Weeping Angels...does the Master count? The Heavenly Host, Adipose, Pyroviles, more Ood, Sontarans, the Hath, the giant Wasp, Vashta Nerada, the time beetle, more Daleks and some Judoon, more Cybermen, Tritovores, the Flood and the Master again.

OK, so RTD looks as though, when push comes to shove, he allowed three stories to not have monsters. Oh no wait! I'm a crazy fool...I forgot about the Futurekind and the Toclafane. Right, so cut that down to two stories. OK, so I'm being extremely sarcastic here, but the point is that RTD didn't skip a beat to have monsters in his version of the series, and really how many of them had ""characters""? The Cat People, yes. The Daleks, yes. The Abzorbaloff and the Racnoss...Krillitanes at a stretch. 

No, the monsters aren't passive beasts, but generally they aren't characters really. They are a race, and they are treated like all the monsters in the classic series were treated (and can I just say at this point that I don't see that as a bad thing as such, either). Indeed to suggest the Cybermen were characters might almost destroy the entire point of them .

Now, I'm prepared to work with most of what is said here, but there was one statement which I don't think I can really agree with and that's the idea that the core story of Doctor Who is the that of the Doctor himself and what he does as a character. Now, if the statement was the core story was that of the Doctor's companion and what she does as a character, I'd buy it, but the Doctor?

RTD said that one of the joys about writing the last few specials was that they were able to develop the character of the Doctor without pressing any reset button (though I'd take him to task and suggest that, while he did develop the character in The Waters of Mars, he pretty much did hit a reset button for the beginning of The End of Time, but that's another debate for another time). The point was that the Doctor's character can't be developed, and if you do it, the only time you really can is in the final story for that Doctor. And it's true - there's no character development for the second, third, fifth or tenth Doctors until that final story (with the exception of The Family of Blood - say hello reset switch). There's no character development at all for the sixth and eighth Doctors. The character development for the fourth Doctor seemed to consist of the fourth Doctor becoming Tom Baker, while there was some genuine character development for the first and seventh Doctors, though arguably the seventh just took longer to establish his character than most. The first Doctor, did develop, starting as a scary anti-hero, before becoming a senile hero. And that's pretty much the only time that has happened. Once a Doctor's character is established, they are that character from start to finish, and maybe at the end they might have to face their greatest fear (be it the Time Lords, hubris, his own failings or death itself). The ninth Doctor...well, that's one I'd have to give more thought to...I'm not sure on that.

Anyway, the point being that the characters ultimately move the plot along. I mean, we have little interest in Toby Zed. We don't feel sad for the life he lost by becoming corrupted by the Beast. We just want him dead because he's the bad guy. And while some Doctors have different aspects (the eleventh Doctor seems somewhat obsessed with guilt, the tenth a bit more vengeful, the third more arrogant), those characteristics don't make character development. The new series might do a little bit more with the character of the Doctor, but it's not really as great as you think.

Moffat, however, does seem to be making more of an effort in that department in regards to that, and yet ironically it's the season which a lot of people would deem a failure. No arc next year, so it would appear that Mr Moffat is learning from his mistakes. Maybe we all have different definitions of mistakes . And while there are less Monsters under Mr Moffat one might argue that's more from budget restrictions than any real desire to cut down on monsters. (And the Silents have characters? Hmmm...I'm hoping you didn't say that with a straight face  They are almost the very definition of a monster of the week - a very cool monster, but still...).

I will totally, and utterly stand with anyone who stands up and says that the thrust of the new series is the companions, their characters, their lives and how travelling with the Doctor fundamentally changes that for the better. But the monsters are very important to Doctor Who - always have been and always will be, under both RTD and the Grand Moff. And the Doctor's character...well, that's eleven different personalities. Arguably his characer is the least important thing of all ",0,1333485470,null,0,false,0,c483z8u,t3_rpro3,t1_c483z8u,t1_c47vcs1,null,1428649129,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

I kid, but *wow*, has your friend got a lot to say. He's almost as much of a chatterbox as I am!

Alright, alright. I suppose I'd better give response, but seeing as so many of the points you made are ones I agree on, It'll likely be brief:

There's really not much more to say on that point. I'm just hoping that the next time the Doctor gets in an inescapable trap they have him be a little more clever and put a little more work into an escape. Wouldn't want to make things too easy for ol' raggedy, would we?

I agree that a lot of the Doctor's characterization has been retroactively implied, and that One and Seven really are the sole stand-outs in Classic Who (although in my defense they were planning on some development with Six which might have been interesting). 

*However*, more focus has been made on the Doctor's developments as a character than ever before. How he deals with the Time War, what he's done, how he handles the death that surround him day-by-day, that's been central to the Doctor ever since the reboot. Episodes that are entirely about questioning the Doctor's morality or him having to deal with the ramifications of his actions. Some call it brooding, but however you label it it is internal turmoil. It's about him as a character. Who he is and what he does.

And even setting that aside, I think you've forgotten my real point. You believe that I refer to long-term character development. To see a character slowly mature over the course of the series. But that's not the only way (it's not even the primary way) the show's been held up.

No, Doctor Who has been *always* held up by the Doctor's personality.

Turn the Doctor into just a plot tool and what do you get? *Nothing.*

Because it's not just the food. It's the garnish. It's all the fancy candles and ferns and wicker-tied baskets that hang up expensive bottles of wine that make a restaurant. You can say that it's just being served the breadsticks and the chicken alfredo, but it's the panache, the *salesmanship* that makes the whole thing go.

Remove the Doctor's quirks, his odd and lovable behaviours and Doctor Who simply ceases to be.

That was my point, because unlike any other science fiction Doctor Who has one and only one constant: the Doctor. Be he played by some crotchety old goat or some youthful clown he's still going to be this character bursting with personality. Literally just bursting out with persona *every episode*.

Even Blink had Ten give the one speech that the entire show revolved around and had so much weight that it not only created a couple of the series most famous lines (ding when there's stuff, don't blink, timey-wimey) but also sells the Angels as scary, as a real threat. Even in the few moments he appears he shapes the entire episode.

And that's the point. The events don't matter as much as how the Doctor reacts to them. The speeches he gives, the brilliant solutions he makes, the clever plans he makes up on the fly. It all revolves around his personality, his character.

If *anyone* read the Doctor's lines without that lightning-fast energy, without that intense sense of fun then the key aspect of the show, the *main* aspect of the show, is lost.

You see, there are shows with monsters. There are plenty of them, plenty of science fiction that's all about the events and all about the beasties. But Doctor Who just isn't one of them. Never has been. You remove the Doctor from an episode completely and the entire show just kind of sits there.

The show *needs* the Doctor's personality to light it's fire. It's what makes the show come to life.

And yes, this new series has also put a lot of power on the companions. And I think that's another important aspect of why characters are more important than anything else on Doctor Who. You try an remove characters. Just try it and see what you're left with.

An empty TARDIS and a bunch of monsters biting off the heads of random people.

That's not Doctor Who. Never has been, never will be. The monsters, the adventures, the weird space-alien mumbo-jumbo.

In fact, the difference between all tv shows and Doctor Who is that Doctor Who has all the garnish and toppings- time travel, monsters, mythical regenerating aliens. Whereas every other show has characters. What show *doesn't* have characters?

There has been a lot of confusion regarding Tor recently, people suggesting its not safe to do so, that exit nodes can be monitored, that anonymous busted a kiddie fiddler ring, etc

The fact is that Tor (ONLY when setup properly)  is the best way of staying hidden on the internet...

What you have to understand is the following

+ Your ISP can't see what your doing using Tor
+ Your IP will not be found on any server logs
+ the Tor exit node also doesn't know your IP

- Your ISP knows your running Tor

However - and this is really important - you are NOT end to end encrypted - this means that although any monitoring of the exit node cannot see IP address, it can see the contents of any non encrypted traffic sent - meaning that logging into your email/facebook account, etc could be picked up - any messages that revealed any personal info could be potentially seen.

When anonymous 'busted' a paedo gang using an .onion site - they didn't break the anonymity of Tor as such - they used standard social engineering to get visitors to the site to urgently update their Tor plugin - the Tor plugin was fake / a trap - if they had forced all outgoing traffic through Tor their IP wouldn't have been revealed.

If Tor were not safe why is it used predominately by hacker organisations in China? e.g https://twitter.com/#!/AnonymousChina

Kaboul absolutely dwarfs his aerial prowess but Laurent is the only one who comes close to his success rate in ground duels. It's actually eerie how similar they've been.

Shit, based on this season I'd drop Vermaelen down a tier and move Koscielny up a tier. I rate them both but Koscielny has been much more reliable IMO. 

As a pure stopper you can very easily make a case for Kaboul being the best in the league this season. No Vidic to compete with of course, but Younes has some absolutely staggering numbers.

In fact, Aldridge's essential complaint is that our ""recovery"" has been so mishandled. Cup performances aside (which is an ambiguous measure, just ask Birmingham), we are failing in nearly every area, with the possible exception of youth development, but Kenny had nothing to do with a single one of those players respective acquisitions.

As basis for comparison, let's look at Newcastle's last 18 months. This is an example of how recovery should be. In that context, I don't think anyone can claim that we are even approaching making a credible recovery, no matter how dire things were last season.

I am still in favour of keeping Kenny for the remainder of the season, as there is no upside by replacing him at this point.

&gt;To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the *principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples*, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace.

If ever the Argentines do invade (they wont) they'll have the entire UN to contend with for the very reason that the islanders are protected by the UN charter. This isn't a case of a colonial empire desperately holding onto territory but instead the British backing the islanders right to determine their own future.  People seem to forget entirely that the islanders were pretty much entirely ignored by the British government prior to 1982 to the point were they were denied British citizenship under the  British Nationality Act of 1981.  The British government simply didn't give a damn about the islands or its peoples wish to become British.  

Secondly, during the original conflict, many people also forget that the British obtained a UN security council resolution which demanded a withdrawal of Argentine troops and pretty much gave the international go ahead for the British to use military force to defend the islands.  Lets not forget that British also had the backing of the entire EC who placed sanctions on Argentina, and the British also had the political backing of the USA.  A military attempt to seize the islands today would attain similar results internationally and would be political suicide for Kircher.

Thirdly, the Argentine forces are woefully ill equipped for an invasion.  Their military equipment is pretty much the same as was available in 1982.  The british military forces however have advanced technically way beyond what they had in 1982.  For example, the navy has 5 type 45 destroyers at its disposal which have  the best anti air capabilities of any ship on the planet, so advanced that it embarrassed the US navy forces in a joint training exercise a couple of years ago when they had to ask the RN to turn their radar system off as it was hampering their training.

They wont invade, and they have no rightful claim whilst the islanders don't want to be Argentine. Simple as.",0,1333495854,null,0,true,0,c4866ig,t3_rrdxe,t1_c4866ig,t3_rrdxe,null,1428650251,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

Firstly, the Falkland islands are very near Argentina (and Chile). Agreed? Good. They are very far away from Britain. Now, it would be much more practical for those islands to be under Argentine control, as their supplies, resources and energy would come a lot more efficiently from the mainland. At the moment, they suffer embargos at all Argentine ports (and other S.American countries in treaty with Argentina), and would have heavy taxes levied on supplies. The Falkanders want to be British, sure, they want to be under a British government and British economy. But, seeing as Argentina is no longer under a cruel dictatorship that so many of you seem to believe (no, they don't throw people out of planes now), it would be far better suited to have them either self-governed, or joined up with the mainland.
This is not going to happen. But I only wish that the mere 3000 or so islanders could suddenly decide they wanted to be Argentinian, it would have saved the world hundreds of lives 30 years ago and could save a lot of dangerous political posturing in the future.

Whenever something silly happens, like Carroll being pissed off going into the tunnel, something that gets newslines busy about ""disrespect for the club"" and all of that blah blah blah...do we really need to start plotting transfer targets?

I mean, really. If Carroll is sent packing? Oh no, the poor guy has a prince' sum paid for him which drives expectations up the WALL. Oh no, he started against his former club and didn't score goals, something he, like everyone else in the world, would love to do. Oh NO, a liverpool striker is pissed off as he's subbed off before the game ends having his team losing behind him and being unable to finish - takes his shirt off - something acceptable if he does it 5 seconds later and out of the cameras views..

Do we REALLY need to be that group who starts plotting targets in case ""carroll is sent packing"" because he was noticeably pissed about not winning? 

I've been rooting for him since day 1 with high hopes, realistic about his performances and generally just hoping the people in charge aren't stupid enough to suffer from a lack of patience for the lad. But fuck me, why do I have a feeling that *anyone* in the squad could do this and we'd have a completely opposite reaction?  

When I see what I saw, I see someone who's become quite fond of Liverpool. I see someone who may have fallen in love with Liverpool, someone who get's angry when he fails to find the net for his beloved Liverpool. Gerrard does this and he's a hero ""See how mad he is when we don't win, red through and through"" and ""Stevie legend doesn't accept losses"". Carroll does it and what the fuck do we do? ""If he's sent packing, who would you want?""

I know you didn't ALL title this, and I know that despite having dubstep in your name, Ray, you're probably an okay guy.. But really, I'm sorry and don't expect to make friends over this, but I think this calls for a nice big ol'..""Fuck off"". 

I'm honestly insulted by this title and with all due respect (I love you brothers in Red, please hear my full point) to the OP and those who've responded - I'm happy with Andy's reaction. Ofc there's always the ""be more professional"" attitude, but fuck me. The boy wants to win games, especially in our current form and position and especially against his former club. I think we're better than this, discussing transfer targets and even considering an ""if carroll is sent packing"". 5½ years is what we signed him for, not ""Until the first time you make the frustration we all share visible"". 

Get behind him. What, Suarez isn't being considered as someone to ""send packing"" because he kept his shirt on? We didn't plot sending him off when he was flipping off fans or bickering with Evra or any of that shit. How dare you undermine the club by even considering to think about *potentially leaving room* for the *idea* of a *concept* of a *chance* of him being put up for sale; what, based on being pissed? 

And in this very comment list, Balotelli is mentioned? Yet we're talking about a player being shipped off immediately after a not-even-episode? Let him headbutt Kenny, let him shove Stevie away from him, let him get sent off for some BS, THEN talk about a Liverpool player being ""sent packing.""

Which episode, by series (if we go by Doctor it might be too much) is your favorite? An what the hell, let's go by Doctor anyway.

I'm afraid my Classic Who is a bit spotty, so name your favorites from there as well and hopefully I'll have seen it.

Alrighty then:

Series 1: Dalek (I actually feel this one's more potent than Empty Child, but just marginally)

Series 2: The Girl in the Fireplace (Followed closely by School Reunion, for me)

Series 3: Blink, not even a contest

Series 4: Midnight

Series 5: The Eleventh Hour (if that's a special then it's Lodger, I actually know too much about Vincent's actual life to like Vincent and the Doctor. Kind of ruined for me knowing he didn't actually commit suicide and lived a pretty different life than what was portrayed)

Series 6: Toss-Up. Really tempted to go with the obvious and Say Doctor's Wife, but I personally loved Closing Time. Either or.

I adored the Series 5 Christmas Special, and feel it's the best Doctor Who special of them all. Seriously.

Those are my casts. I can't really give fair assessment to Classic Who, as I've not seen all of it, so can't fairly compare and contrast.

Oh! And best of Doctors (based on how well they did as Doctors, but that really wasn't the goal):

Funnily enough, that's the point he's presenting evidence for - it's people not willing to educate themselves on what they are taking, or not taking this education into account when they do! There are a number stupid people everywhere, with more people attending university and in an environment where they can access drugs, there are more stupid people who are going to be stupid with them.

I attend university and know many people in these circles, none are as stupid or downright reckless with their drug use. Anecdotal evidence, sure, but at least it's not to the end of flagrant sensationalisation; noting that the headline mentions university students 'becoming' more reckless, while the article is about a bunch of people he knew at one time when he went to university.

Here's one of our greatest ever players who pours everything into the shirt he wears, being benched in favor of Raul Meireles, a new signing who's never seemed to be that passionate about our team. Not only that but he puts in indifferent performances, the entire team plays worse (not signaling out Raul for it) and to top it off, AVB offers no explanation of why Lampard is being overlooked as much as he is.

Given these circumstances, I find it more than fair to be upset about what's going on. I don't see it so much of an ego thing anymore but rather someone who genuinely cares about the club having truly upset about what he's seeing happening to his team and being denied the chance to help change things. 

He could have handled things more professionally, but I also believe the reports that AVB said nothing to him. So I'm sure he tried to talk it out with him, but received nothing on that front.

Series 1: Dalek (but the original radio drama version from which Dalek was adapted is way better- Jubilee).

Series 2: Girl in the Fireplace

Series 3: Human Nature/Family of Blood (Blink is good but this story is more emotionally moving)

Series 4: Midnight (because Silence/Forest is old for me and the finale is too fan servicey though I love it)

Series 5: Vincent and the Doctor hands down. When is it said that he doesn't kill himself in the altered timeline?

Series 6: Girl Who Waited (tempted for Doctor's Wife. Closing Time I didn't even think was that good)

Agreed, series 5 special is best of them all. Looks like we agree on most. Some of them I can't really give an honest ruling like series 4, but I did my best. What of classic Who have you seen so far and who is your favorite Doctor?

Of each Doctor

I still think Dalglish deserves another season or at least to the end of the January '13 transfer window.

This is still Dalglish's first full season in the Premier League after a long lay-off. We know what he is capable of. He deserves a summer of fresh transfers and a pre-season and see how he handles the League, the domestic Cups and Europa.

true,HPB,eng-durham,Durham,"I think we all understand why Argentina is doing what they're doing, for the same reasons that they did it in 1982.

The problem I have is the implication that the UK Government at the time retook the islands to distract the population and gain re-election, rather than doing it to take back our territory that was invaded and free our people living under an imposed dictatorship. There wasn't even an election going on in the UK at the time.

The UK Government did not engineer this situation. In fact they were widely criticised for allowing it to happen in the first place.

I remember the overwhelming support that the Government had at the time when they planned to retake the islands, not just in Parliament or in the media but amongst the public. This feeling was not as the result of some sophisticated government campaign led by Thatcher to influence hearts and minds. It was the public knowing what was right and wanting the government to do something about it, and supporting the decision to retake the islands by force if necessary. Remember - Diplomacy was tried during the time it took for the task force to sail to the islands.

The islands were retaken because the Argentinians invaded our territory and we wanted it back.

Of course the government used the circumstances in their election campaign the following year and the victory over Argentina helped to get the Tories re-elected. Any political party who had been in power during the conflict would have done the same and been entitled to do so - it was a successful military campaign that most countries expected was beyond our reach. To suggest that this was the sole factor in them being re-elected is naive and simplistic. Even without the conflict the Tories would probably have been re-elected as there was no effective opposition.",0,1333526563,null,0,false,0,c48bdqx,t3_rrdxe,t1_c48bdqx,t1_c485u62,null,1428652696,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

For example, if a local health budget is £100 million and central government says to spend 10% on heart attacks, and 0.5% of tuberculosis - then that would be fine in Glasgow, and downright dangerous in Newham.

What we should have is more local control of the spending budget, not less, so that spending priorities can be more closely matched to local needs.

Of course, that then means that a person suffering a heart attack in Newham might get inferior care to someone in Glasgow (and will rant about it in the local papers - if they survive), but that is balanced the fact that a TB sufferer in Glasgow might wish they lived in Newham.

From the (misguided, yet still widespread) Argentine point of view, las Malvinas are Argentine territory being occupied by British forces. Attempts by Argentina to retake the islands, by force then and by diplomacy now, are likely to win Cristina Fernández de Kirchner support because it is a case of ""the public knowing what is right and wanting the government to do something about it, and supporting the decision to retake the islands by ~~force~~ diplomatic pressure if necessary"".

I wore kevlar lined jeans most of the time, with cheap waterproofs to pull over the top if it was raining.

However, I had a big bike that only did about 45mpg, and it's pretty easy to get a car that can beat that these days (although it's not nearly as much fun!). 

Big cities can be pretty dangerous on a bike because you spend so much time doing things the cars don't expect, but otherwise most bike accidents tend to be caused by the rider having too much fun.

The problem is that we're so used to the lifestyles that can be afforded when we're not spending 10-15% of GDP per year just on interest and loan repayments (which is what was happening between about 1950 and 1975, when people were still used to crazy levels of austerity caused by global wars) that it's difficult to get people to accept that *anything* has to change at all.  
  
Too many people seem to think that things will sort themselves out with no impact on lifestyle whatsoever.  We could quite easily decide to take 25 years to get back to a debt level of 40% GDP again, and it wouldn't be all that painful (5-6% of GDP a year instead of 10-15%), but it would mean slightly higher taxes for the duration.  
  
We do have to get debt under control, because if we don't then it will end up being more expensive to the taxpayer in the long term, but it's not something that has to be done anywhere near as rapidly as the government think.  Sure, there's wasteful spending - there is in every organisation and government - and some quangos are probably unnecessary, or burdensome, or their members are overpaid, so some level of spending reduction is perfectly acceptable, but the ideological drive to appease the stock market and blindly hoping that private enterprise will step into whatever void is left by the lack of public services?

There's no reason why we shouldn't carry on doing these things if they make us happy.  That's the essence of freedom of expression.

The thing that has no place in the modern world is allowing those irrational beliefs to start affecting ones decision-making process.  The problem is not that MPs pray to magic sky fairies, but that they accept religious dogma as fact and try to impose their personal religious beliefs on others.

A lot of the participants are fat, don't usually exercise and probably don't wear deodorant. 

The stench even covered up the smell of the fresh sea air along the seafront where we crossed paths; it approaches as a warm musky torrent and then relentlessly sticks to the back of your throat.

Of course pro-lifers will claim it's their victory and the clinics will say the checks have political motives. The left will report it one way and the right will report it the other.

I don't care about the spin and bullshit, I don't really have time for it. I care about what the government actually does and so far it doesn't look like Nadine Dorries and her gang of fetus huggers are getting anywhere. 

If these clinic checks turn into something else, i.e new laws, then we should worry. But if it's found they were breaking the law then they've brought it upon themselves and handed the pro-lifer's a bigger victory than Nadine would ever achieve.

I hope the claims are unfounded or just very few in number. Seeing abortion doctors in court would be a pro-lifer's wet dream.

What original bill? No bill has been officially announced. We don't know what's really in it. We've heard a few titbits about information being stored and accessed but no real flesh to the bones. Which is precisely the point. You release enough info to get people making a noise and then when it comes to actually announcing the bill most of the controversial bits have disappeared.

The momentum for the campaign against it is lost as some people pat themselves on the back for thinking they made a difference and others decide they don't have such a big issue with what is actually being proposed.

With less opposition the government can pass the bill they always wanted to because they've already worn down the campaign against it by giving them a false start.

But yeah I agree with you people are morons for arguing between Labour and Conservatives, they’re both… just… awful.

Plus the system needs to stop ignoring how many people don’t vote, not voting should go down as a vote of no confidence and an expression of how useless the whole system is.
Or people who don’t vote should get off their arses and vote void, although I am sure how seriously they take void votes.
At least then they could not dismiss people who don’t vote as lazy, (although a lot are but most genuinely think their vote makes no difference) if at least 50% of people could vote void maybe that would make them rethink the entire system.
I was just thinking maybe I should start another thread about the effects of voting void and ask people to debate it.

If you think it is a good idea then just say so and save your opinion on the effects of voting void for the new thread.

It was an example of Direct Democracy that took the UK in the EU - a referendum was held on the subject.

As to the second - there hasn't been a single party that has stood on a mandate to abolish government borrowing and pay down debt that then went on to win an election. The electorate loves spending today and hoping someone else will pick up the bill tomorrow.

I can't say if war in Iraq would have gone ahead after a referendum, but I suspect it might have. Despite the headlines and protests by activists, the silent majority did seem to at the least, accept the notion of war. Quite what they would have said if given a vote on it is something we will never know.

&gt; Religion is harmful much like taking heroin is harmful,

I certainly wouldn't call religion harmful in my Mother's case, for example.  She goes to church, sees her friends, arranges flowers, sings hymns, and thoroughly enjoys herself.  Whether or not she actually believes in God or just goes along with it to fit in with the other people is neither here nor there.  

I prefer to go skateboarding on a Sunday morning.  As a direct result of skateboarding I've lost my 2 front teeth, gouged chunks out of my legs, broken bones and knocked myself out.  I don't recall my mother ever suffering that kind of harm from her Sunday morning exploits at church.  Which is more harmful?

The problem with religion is not the private worship of sky fairies, it's what happens when they start trying to tell other what they can and can't do.  You telling someone that they can't pray to a god or hang a poster of Justin Bieber on their wall is no different to the religious loons telling me I can't buy a pint of milk on Sunday evening.

Half the population has got breasts and there's absolutely nothing special about them, especially when you get to my age and you've seen them in every different shape and size.

On a motorbike, you can drive like a car and be pretty safe - or you can overtake a lot of cars and go a lot faster but that puts you in places where car drivers don't expect you to be, so they don't look for you.

For example, most car drivers wouldn't check over their shoulder before turning because they don't expect another car to be overtaking them. A motorcyclist soon learns not to overtake past a side road in case the car turns in front of them. 

After a while you learn what's safe and what puts you at risk. 

On a pushbike, you can't keep up with the traffic, which always feels dangerous to me, as cars overtake you all the time, even when there isn't really room.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;This simply isnt the case. It assumes that the entire reason that any action is being taken against him is because of this document, whereas you and I both know that the document charge is icing to the far far bigger charge of assisting someone to commit an act of terrorism.

Well, I agree with you that I suspect it's a fall back count, the main count is the other.  But he could still end up convicted of it, which would mean he was _convicted_ purely of document possession - the other charges failing to be proven.  Now, when that's manslaughter as an alternative to murder, I don't think anyone would dispute its validity - if you can't prove murder, manslaughter might be a just alternative.  But if I can't prove you were making preparatory terrorist acts, or the jury doesn't believe you were engaged in terrorism at all, why should I be forced to find you guilty on a count of simply having (say) a library book on explosives?

&gt;Which shows that you know that hes speaking crap, if the nicest thing you can say about an argument is ""its not entirely bullshit, there is some truth in there too"" then its hardly a position I'd like to take up.

&gt;I respect you, and your lawyery skills, but dont piss on my head and tell me its raining.

Thanks for the backhanded compliment (I think!)  I think he's exaggerating, but not incorrect.  And I think the possession of a document count on the charge sheet sucks.  For the rest, I want to see the evidence.  If he's convicted on count 2 and not count 1, the Guardian will definitely be justified to post a headline ""Man convicted for possessing a document"".

To have two people like this in our attacking midfield might not be great in the EPL/European Leagues. 2. He's only come into form this season as a starter.

true,GrowleyTheBear,eng-staffordshire,Staffordshire,"In short: Kayaking, Skydiving, Climbing, Mountain Biking, SCUBA diving, Sailing, Windsurfing, Surfing, Long distance Hiking. Google is your friend.

Lets see, Kayaking's pretty extreme and there's lots of that to be had off in Wales and Scotland. There are a few interesting rivers down in Devon/Cornwall as well. Look up your local club and i'm sure they'll be only too happy to help out an interested potential member. This is what i'm most active doing and i'll warn you thus; it's dangerous. Never go alone and always go with someone who knows what they're doing. Most of the deaths that happen are inexperienced people who don't know what they're doing. If you're unsure about a rapid, don't run it. Walk around. Edit: Rafting is a hell of a lot of fun too and it's a lot safer and a lot easier to get into straight away. 

Then there's Skydiving, that's definitely extreme. Not nearly as dangerous as popular perception would have you believe either. There are a few big places that do that here in the UK like Langar in Nottingham. Got into it through my University club, found it a bit too expensive though. Still did 6 jumps or so and had a lot of fun.

There's also Climbing which, again can be done pretty easily if you look up your local club, there are plenty of indoor climbing walls about which will be able to give you a bit of practice. There are a couple of centres which offer Ice climbing as well One in Glasgow, one in London IIRC.

Sailing: Not had much experience with it if i'm honest, but i hear it's pretty fun. A Dry suit is a good idea. 

SCUBA diving: Clubs are all over the place, same as Sailing. You'll be better off a dry suit for our weather though. Did some in Thailand when i was there, it's a great feeling. Been meaning to get into it here in the UK since i've got back. Not had the time/money though.

Windsurfing/Surfing: Go to Cornwall or South-west Wales. 'nuff said. 

Hiking: Doesn't sound that extreme, but it's honestly one of the more difficult thing's i've done, but also one of the most rewarding. Walked Wainwright's 220mi Coast to Coast route last year with a few mates, camping and carrying our food and accommodation with us, didn't have much experience with Camping or Hiking beforehand but I loved it, doing the West Highland way with the same people in a few weeks. 


There's plenty on offer if you know where to look. If you're just looking for a one time thing like a bungee jump i'd recommend going on a Tandem Skydive, you'll get some nice free-fall and you'll be strapped to someone with a lot of experience who'll want to get down just as safely as you do (Probably even more safely in fact) Hope this helps!

My grandmother had it (full mastectomy but survived), two of my female friends from my school days have had it (one lived with a partial mastectomy, one is in remission after chemo/radiotherapy) and my mother has found more lumps in her breasts than I can remember (all benign, thankfully, but worrying all the same).  Oh, and I knew a bloke who had breast cancer, too (full mastectomy including all the pectoral muscles on one side).  They're the ones I can remember, but I'm sure there are others.

So please don't tell me that I don't care about anything except bouncing breasts.  I care a great deal about the cause and I support Cancer Relief with regular donations.  If they would let me run in the race then I'd do that too.  I'd do it blindfolded if it would make you happy.

But as far as I'm aware, the whole event is designed to raise money for charity and to raise awareness about breast cancer.  They way they do that is by celebrating the breast.  Pink ribbons, pink bras worn outside the clothes, pink lycra tops and so on. My comment may have been in poor taste and I apologise unreservedly if I mistakenly gave the impression that bouncing breasts were the only thing of importance here. But please don't vilify me for noticing their breasts when they've collectively done so much to bring them to my attention.  

&gt; this will be my last post on the matter.

Then I shall have the final word!  In my dictionary that is ""Zythum"".

Less is more in horror. Your enemy should be seen and learned about as little as possible, because being left in the dark is scary.

When the Borg were just this incomprehensible organism, something that was totally unlike any human life, you were scared. It was something totally unseen before, something totally inhuman. And then they put a face on it and then people were able to wrap their minds around the Borg too much.

That's why the recent two-parter with the Angels was a bit of a flop. It changed things while trying to overload you with more Angels, encumbering them with pointless rules while stripping them of major aspects like not being able to look at each other or not moving while seen.

But then on the other: We're *all* human. Very likely we'll all suffer from the disease in some way (either by getting it or someone close) at some point in our lives.

I'm not sure cancer fund raising should be creating dividing lines between the sexes. But then... how much money as RfL managed to raise by being exclusive in this respect?

Having said that, I wonder what I'd find if I went along to the next local RfL and did a quick survey around the people there (runners and supporters) asking if they know that men can get breast cancer too and what the rate of incidence is.

Essentially, I didn't ask to be a mod, but I would like to be.  I've hesitantly suggested meetups a few times on here, I spend too much time on reddit and I agree that I'm a pretty active contributor to this sub.  I'd even agree that generally I seem to be liked, or at least not hated!

If anyone has a massive issue with me personally being a mod, then you should probably mention that, because I don't really want people to dislike me.  I've hardly been given title of Fuhrer or anything, it's not a massive deal.  

Oh, and if you don't like my boobs, you don't need to look at them.  They're pages and pages back in my history, if it's that bothersome you can even pretend they don't exist.  Pretend I'm a man.  Pretend I'm a giraffe.  I will just look like a woman at meetups, which I would like to arrange :3

Basically, I'm more than happy to take on a mod role, it's not a massive deal so I don't think there's a need for too much drama, unless you actually have a big problem with me in general.  Don't give Prawns or JJ grief about it because it's just such a small thing to make a drama out of.  I like you guys, and if you don't mind me modding then that's awesome.

You will often be taught directly or guided by internationally respected researchers, leaders in their fields.

Our students have access to all the resources you would expect from a world-class university and as a student, you'd get access to our seven unions, which are scattered throughout town.  The drinking age in UK is 18 and Edinburgh has the UK's longest drinking hours.. and the city, like the populace, is also very attractive :D

We've a large international student body, with lots of student accommodation (1st year undergrads are guaranteed a place, I believe!) There is a diverse selection of student societies with which you can get involved - plenty opportunities and ways to meet people have been set up already so you'll never get lonely.

I think a rounded student experience goes beyond the university walls/book study and most people find the city itself to be vibrant and beautiful.  Edinburgh is large enough to have the transport links/shopping/nightlife associated with a large city but small enough that you can walk/cycle everywhere. If you get tired of walking, our bus service is arguably one of the best in the UK. 

We also host the world's biggest arts festival in the world every August.

For what it's worth, my general opinion on Moffat is that he writes great one/two-part stories, but when he gets a whole season, he tries to do too much, and usually falls short (the fan theories about how the doc survives his death were *much* better than what actually happened). He clearly has some great ideas (Like River's out-of-order relationship), but then they fall short of a satisfying conclusion (the out-of-order part shouldn't be the *only* reason the Doctor is interested in her).

Perhaps trying to promote knowledge of the disease should take a less girly-pink approach and include men, as when men do contract it, they not only have a battle for life on their hands, but also the stigma of a disease so frequently associated with women and femininity. There is also much more awareness-raising of cervical cancer, for example, than male cancers, such as prostate and testicular. Considering as well that men are less likely to go to the doctor in the first place, perhaps there should be more awareness raising of male cancers. In all honesty, I don't think there is a single woman in the country that doesnt know the symptoms of breast cancer, and that they should check regularly.",0,1333575114,null,0,false,0,c48jau6,t3_rsnf5,t1_c48jau6,t3_rsnf5,null,1428656493,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Yes, in real life likable people are evenly distributed. And the problem isn't writing a female Doctor differently, it's people perceiving that female character differently. If you wrote a part in a story of a unisexly named character, Alex, and then had a man and woman play two different versions, it would definitely change one's perception. Not only because of sexism/bias but because men and women are just plain different.

Part of the problem is that most literature/fiction was/is written by males with male protagonists. So when confronted with female characters of female authors, boys don’t know what to do. They feel as if they can’t connect with these characters because of the gender boundaries. Girls have to connect to male characters, but boys don’t have to connect to female characters. So by the time they’re older/teenager/etc, it’s not even intentional: many honestly think that they won’t understand a female character because they have no shared experiences whatsoever. This means that it's harder for writers to create a relatable character that's female when half the audience can't relate.

Nowadays there are definitely more female protagonists and writers, but I think this still applies, especially for older audiences. And even though the Doctor is alien, making the Doctor alien and female just makes things harder. I know that what I said above still applies, because I often feel that I relate to male protagonists more often.

Norway does have consultation and input to any directives that they implement through the EFTA council but it is free of CAP and CFP and retains its seat on the WTO which members of Europe relinquish.

The UKs representation in Europe is weak anyway.  As a rule of thumb the more popular a European party is in the UK the less popular it is on the continent.  Culturally, politically, we're just different and our majorities are very much in the European minority.  The two most popular UK European parties have one of the weakest voting blocs and no voting bloc, and policies are passed on a quid pro quo basis anyway, so representation as a whole is a bit of a joke.

Renewable energy subsidies in the UK is a scam.  Two thirds of UK windfarms are owned by other European states.  £500 million goes out of the UK economy and to foreign companies every year in subsidies, and for what?  It's not ever going to be a solution, it's not dependable, they're not even particularly environmental.  Far better to actually address the forthcoming energy shortfall by investing everything in nuclear with a view to developing thorium reactors before this half of the century is done.

I never vote for the party.  I would only vote for the candidate.  If Farage was running in my constituency, yes I would likely support him.

true,[deleted],null,null,"You can't just write of the UK's representation as null when we have the 3rd most seats in European parliament, which will increase as our population increases over the next few years. Also Norway doesn't really have much input on things like Schengen and a lot of other initiatives its taken part in, which are part of EU institutions. 

I get that the conservatives aren't in the People's Party but that was a choice of the conservative party, I imagine with significant support from its voters. We used to have a party in the peoples party, and in the 90s the socialist party was chaired by a briton. The high representative of foreign affairs is british. Generally our majority agrees with the EU majority on a huge range of issues except on the issue of how much power the EU should have, down to what I would call the poisoning of the EU's public appearance by the media.

~~Also, What do you mean the more popular a european parliament is in the UK the less popular it is on the continent? We don't vote directly for european parliaments, although that would be favorable.~~ That's not true either, Italy has 9/10 MEPs in the European freedom whatever block that UKIP is in, on par with the UK. The conservative block (not Peoples party) is joined by a lot of other major european parties too.  And of course we have representation in basically all of the main voting blocks. Just because we're not in EU office doesn't mean we have no power.

This whole ""we're culturally different"" thing is a bit washed out by now, we basically wrote the european convention on human rights yet we sit here and attack it today. Do you actually think we are culturally different or is it just because a bunch of people are saying it? We are a lot more similar to Europe than America. America doesn't even have a functioning socialist party, but we invented universal healthcare.

Sure we consume their media, but so does every other European country. The idea of Europe is not homogeneity, but collective diversity. That's why the motto is 'United in Diversity'.

If you're making a whole pot however, I'd have to say that the milk, from an objective standpoint, should be poured into the cup first.

He grew up a scouser and gave his heart and soul to the team for the 3 short years he was there before kenny gave him the short end of the stick and sent him packing when Rush came back.

He is third in goals/games played with a ratio of 0.60 for liverpool behind 

1) Torres 0.64
2) Ian Rush (during his first stint) 0.62
3) Aldo (0.60)

If you count over both Rushie's terms as a red then Aldo goes to second and Rushie goes down to a ratio of 0.49

Torres Played for LFC between the ages of 23 and 27
Rush's first stint as a red were between the ages of 19 and 26
Aldo was playing at Anfield between the ages of 28 and 31

Dalglish was worried, rightly so, that Aldo and Rush were not linking up well.  He just made the mistake of getting rid of the wrong player.  Aldridge was destroyed when he found out he was being sold off by his childhood club after less than 3 years with them and threw everything but his shorts into the KOP after his last match and bawled his eyes out in the locker room.

He is also one of the friendliest people i have ever met and one of the most knowledgeable and enjoyable people to listen to talk about football.  He doesn't mince words and won't sugarcoat and opinion but he's almost always fair with his assessments.

It's not horrible for them to be in 2 seasons. In a show of 33+ seasons, it's not such a horrible thing. Most shows keep their entire cast throughout the whole duration (Monk).

The show isn't going to ""put its foot down"". This isn't even a thing. In fact, this is one the weirder complaints I've heard. Plus, the show has not always been about running. The whole running subplot really took place post-Time War, especially with 10 and 11 who say it straight out. But besides knowing that the first Doctor had been exiled from his people, it was never suggested that they were running from something until maybe...what, the Black Guardian? Besides, I thought the one thing Doctor Who was about was the Doctor's character. Or the character of the Doctor. You actually cited both in our previous discussion.

As for Amy, so she's got less potential. They can always write in potential. At first Rory looked like another scorned boyfriend until they added the depth of the Centurion and the idea that he preferred the safer more common-sense life. 

Waving about that gun and self entitlement? Yeah, that is a character flaw of hers. But aren't the characters in the show the most important? Isn't it *realistic* for a companion to have character flaws? Humans aren't perfect. Sounds like you just plain don't like Amy, and that's great. River's sense of entitlement to the Doctor bugs me, but I'm not going to say the show should wipe her out or that she's a lousy character.

This is a long post just to say ""I don't like Amy and am ready for her to leave.""",0,1333580643,null,0,false,0,c48kggn,t3_rtgmj,t1_c48kggn,t3_rtgmj,null,1428657038,15,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,15

Traditionally, men are heads of the household, right?  We don't need to embrace that idea, but its still a more prominent behavior, because breaking from tradition is difficult.  Not because its sacred.  Because our culture is founded in what came before.  Tradition isn't a good excuse for anything.

true,Rotgrub,null,null,"&gt;You can't just write of the UK's representation as null when we have the 3rd most seats in European parliament,

I didn't say it was null I said it was weak, and I explained perfectly well how the majority of UK MEPs belong to minority blocs in Europe.

&gt;I get that the conservatives aren't in the People's Party but that was a choice of the conservative party, 

And the Conservative Party are the most popular party in the UK but they can't stay part of a voting bloc that wants a more federalised EU if that's not what they believe in.  It stands that the overriding UK sentiment means not being in any of the big voting blocs.

How British people vote in their majorities is not how Europeans tend to vote.  It's why people in Europe are often frustrated with the UK attitude.  It's as simple as this; it's just different.

&gt;The high representative of foreign affairs is british. 

Only by oath she's not allowed to act in the interests of Britain but under the assumption that what ever is good for Europe will also be in British interests, which clearly isn't the case.  What's good for the whole may well be terrible for an individual member - check out Spain as an example.  Also that British person, never been elected by the electorate to any office.  I really wouldn't bring Catherine Ashton up at any time as a positive argument for anything.

&gt;That's not true either, Italy has 9/10 MEPs in the European freedom whatever block that UKIP is in,

The EFD has 34 MEPs.  Less than 5% of the vote, it's ridiculous to consider it a bloc in the same terms as the power brokers.  This is Britain's second most popular party and they're all but in exile.

&gt;And of course we have representation in basically all of the main voting blocks. Just because we're not in EU office doesn't mean we have no power.

And it doesn't reflect UK sentiment.  The most popular parties are in the less represented blocs, the less popular parties are in the more popular blocs.  European politics do not reflect popular UK sentiment.  That's all there is to it.  It's not even controversial to say it.

&gt;This whole ""we're culturally different"" thing is a bit washed out by now, we basically wrote the european convention on human rights yet we sit here and attack it today. 

The ECHR is not EU - and I don't know why you brought it up.  I didn't bring it up.  Do I think we're culturally different?  Yes, without a shadow of a doubt.  That's not to say culturally superior but culturally are we different from the French, Italians and Spanish?  Yes.  Transparently so.  We do have more in common with the Dutch and Germans, but we're still culturally very different.   We joke about it ourselves how the British outlook and attitude is somewhat unique.  Our economies and industries reflect Britishness too, the reason why Britain does so terribly out of the CAP is because we don't have the cultural attitude the French and Germans do to small holdings and farms which CAP serves best.

Of course we have stronger cultural similarities to Europe than America in some regards, but that's not to say we're still not different.  It's clear that we are and that we have different philosophies, perspectives, and priorities.

&gt;The idea of Europe is not homogeneity, but collective diversity. That's why the motto is 'United in Diversity'.

Then you need to go and read the Treaty of Lisbon and ask why there's such a big drive for Federalisation, because that's not celebrating diversity, it very much has turned into homogeneity, and CAP and CFP don't do anything to protect the UK's diversity from the norm.  What's the Euro project if not an exercise in homogeneity? The whole Commission screams a new EU identity. If it was united in diversity there'd be the four freedoms and that would be it - no directives, no common law.  Nobody was celebrating Spanish diversity when the EU big dogs left them out to hang.  They didn't do anything wrong, the reason why it's in a mess now is because the EU screwed them over.",0,1333581943,null,0,false,0,c48kpze,t3_rt7lq,t1_c48kpze,t1_c48k6aq,null,1428657163,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The United Kingdom does have its own monetary policy but we've also had a history of paying back debts along with a larger and much more diverse economy than Greece's. Greece's survival has bordered on miraculous so far as everything was poorly managed across the board, especially when it came to collecting revenue. The deficit widened and negotiations between unions and other institutions were terrible. The wage changes are primarily public sector as Greece needs to immediately balance the books but anyone who directly equates Britain with Greece is naive as the UK is a global economy while Greece is not.

As for Germany, it wants the EU project to work as Germany relies on the flow of goods and labour. The EU solidifies trading relationships between member states and it's much easier to co-operate. Germany's EU representation is actually smaller than what it should be as well, due to the fact representation is more population based but still has the same number as the French and British, despite the 20 million population difference.

The EU project is nice on paper but in practice has endemic flaws which undermine the whole union, particularly when it comes to fiscal policy. Greece has been forced to cut so much to get things back on track because it risks compromising the whole system. The Euro is a flawed currency because the risk of failure becomes collective, Gordon Brown actually warned against these potential problems early on. Hence Britain's disinterest with joining the single currency. Soon enough a serious overhaul will have to be looked into to prevent further catastrophe but the entirety of the EU needs tweaking.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Seriously, giving genders to nouns is pretty arbitrary. Don't let the fact that we call these terms feminine, masculine, and neuter trick you into thinking it has much to do with human definitions of femininity and masculinity. At most, *Mann* is masculine and *Frau* is feminine (woman). There are some systems to gender- like most imported words like Disco are feminine. Most machines whose nouns end in -er are masculine- Rechner, Geschirrspueler... Words that start with Ge- tend to be neuter Geschirr, Genick, Geschlecht...

Now a real example of how language reveals the hidden sexism back then is that the word Frau (woman) also means wife. Of course Mann also means husband... Gender roles were fixed for men and women. Men couldn't cry back then or they'd be shamed.

Tradition isn't an excuse for sexism, but it's an explanation for it. It shows that while we may have sexist things in our society, it isn't a result of sexism in our *current modern* society, but rather, from the past. Well, unless you consider the fact that it's *still* not acceptable for women to wear suits to wedding to be sexist, then yeah.

What reason are habits perpetuated for? If people had maintained calling chairs *he* in English would you read some kind of sexism towards males in that? Or if cars were feminine and referred to as *she* in English, would that be sexism? (car is *das Auto*, neuter). In German, all nouns are still referred to as she/he/it depending on die/der/das fem/masc/neuter. But the Germans aren't sexist.

And if you think that there is a cultural influence that is promoting us to keep referring to ships as *she* then what is this? I mean how often do you even hear people referring to ships as she anyways? If one wanted to promote/prevent sexism, it would be a lot more effective to do it with bigger issues...like how women are paid less than men despite the Equal Pay Act.

true,[deleted],null,null,"On top of the tradition doesn't make it right, ""she"" referring to cars and vehicles is a lot different than a masculine chair. If we can make the analogy that the TARDIS is like a car, then we can present an argument using car culture that justifies the idea that referring to the TARDIS as a woman can be construed as a sexist ideal. In car culture, cars are often referred to as ""she"" and given a female name (same with aeroplanes, and other forms of transportation.) In the 1950s, where car culture really came to fruition, cars were referred to as women because they constantly needed to be taken care of. Cars were finicky and always in need of a tune up.  Therefore a man could take care of his ""baby."" Plus if the car was a dude, or masculine, that'd be homosexual and god knows we can't have that. Therefore cars took on a feminine role because men needed to take care of them.*

*Also, men needing to take care of women is a theme continually seen in Doctor Who. While you see that the women sometimes save the Doctor, such as in ""The Parting of Ways,"" overall the women still NEED the doctor. Back to the episode, when the TARDIS is a human, she's a crazy needy in love woman.

true,Tommah666,lancashire,Red Rose Redditor,"The worries about buying the essentials is understandable but most of it is based more on domestic policy and pricing but I digress, I'll get to the main questions.

For the future they'll be some stumbling towards a stable recovery with potential for more bailing out but at some point they'll be another treaty which may tighten up the fiscal elements to ensure this fiasco doesn't happen again or that it can spread. The latter however being difficult under a single fiscal regime. 

The minimum wage lowering was mainly to rein in Greek incompetence, it won't be a permanent measure and labour laws in other more stable EU states are a lot stronger. As for the UK, we're happier staying on the sidelines and then bitching on occasion at the moment. As for business opportunities, the EU does a lot in terms of trade and development grants. Liverpool airport for example was upgraded with EU money. The notion of a United States of Europe is a concern but once again it comes down to how the EU agrees to draw a line. The system does need tweaking though, that's a given but it'll be done on a broad consensus by more competent groups than UKIP, who just sit in a corner and moan.

As for local elections, voting UKIP is redundant as they're a single issue party and local elections have no effect on European Policy, if you mean the EU rep elections at the same time. I don't recommend UKIP for the reason that they don't ever bring anything to the table and tend to join other right leaning parties who just moan. On the ACTA issue we share disagreement but I believe it's more over the nature of the law rather than a civil liberties issue.

On quality of life, that remains consistent and some EU legislation in terms of human and civil rights has helped in that respect. As for the cost of things, prices tend to rise with inflation but the benefit of the EU is that it's essentially a large trade agreement but in time we'll see what legislation comes about. Plus a lot of pricing elements are more of a domestic issue. Alcohol pricing for example as it's a tax issue, therefore domestic.

On national defence, we're fine when it comes to Europe but the EU has helped work countries towards a common interest of social democracy with some market principles. It's flawed and needs fixing so for now I'm looking to see how it's addressed.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Hey I love to criticize and evaluate Doctor Who. It's why I'm here. You have a valid point about cars- it's very true that there is sexism in that. But referring to ships as she predates cars by a longshot. You can't compare the two, especially since in America, cars came to symbolize wealth and status in the 50s.

Also, to note, yes Doctor Who has had sexist connotations in the past and maybe even today. I doubt that though (the today part). The show was created in the 60s for pete's sake. In fact, it's very not-too-sexist considering that, and compared to the 70s Star Trek where women were objectified left and right.

The greatest connotation of sexism in Doctor Who is the fact that the women often need saving. But this is because our main character is supposed to be the  all knowing awesome hero protagonist who saves the day. Obviously then, we need a female companion to balance out the main cast's gender (lest one is accused of being sexist). But we also need someone important to get caught by the baddie-of-the-week. It can't be our protagonist Doctor because he's the savior, so it falls to the companion who happens to be female.

It's a trapdoor of sexism. At most, the biggest flaw is that the main character is male and always saves the day. But that's what comics are all about.

On the whole, Doctor Who is not sexist. I read lots of people calling DW sexist, or rather, RTD and Moffat during their run times. I started to question the truth of this. So I wrote a 4 page word document's worth of thinking and analyzing about it. If you'd like to read it I can post here or message you.

              Drogba/Torres*

*I think all of the decisions are easy except Drogba/Torres. Drogba is a great defender and a great header of the ball, but

1) he is mainly a great defender in the air, and Barca never plays anything in the air (they always take corners short and never put balls into the box)

2) his heading would be relatively useless against the height and strength of Puyol/Pique... could be more effective if one of these players were to miss out

3) he would be great for holding up the ball and allowing our defenders to catch up to the attack, but he does not have pace any more and often kills off attacks with his poor/overly speculative passes. Torres is built for the counter-attack, and we are going to be doing a ton of countering.

The big, big, big positive for playing Drogba is that he has great motivation to overcome the unfair result from a few years back ('It's a fucking disgrace!!'). We saw in the second leg against Napoli what a motivated Drogba can do... he was unstoppable.

For my money, we go with Torres, but it is a tough decision, and I think there are merits for going either way. I also think Luiz over Cahill is an easy pick despite his rough game today. He is a clown at times, but he is one of the best in the world at picking out an incisive pass from deep in the formation. We will need to try everything we can to get on the counter and score, and Luiz is a big weapon we will need to use.",0,1333585758,null,0,true,0,c48lgvj,t3_rtlku,t1_c48lgvj,t3_rtlku,null,1428657584,7,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,7

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Monk replaced Sharon with Natalie, so that may not be the best analogy to compare with. I still get your point, it's just funny that you picked one of the few shows that actually has a main titular character go through assistants.

It would seem he never intended to tell Amy and Rory. He told River, sure. He has a relationship with River, but if he wanted his friends to know he was still alive he would have told *all* his friends he was alive. River said she shouldn't tell Amy this, but would anyway. Why would she think she shouldn't tell Amy unless the Doctor intended for *everybody* to think he was dead?

Yeah, you only get a sense of purpose in Doctor who after Black Guardian, what with it being a larger threat and thing for the Doctor to do, but the new series has put a lot of the classic series in a new light. All his wandering now seems like staying in motion. Staying in motion to try to avoid something, to try to forget.

The show's about the Doctor and what he does. And what he does is an awful lot of running.

Flaws, yes. But having a flawed character is only workable in two ways: The character admits falibility and others have to deal with their flaws and abrasions (House and other shows with an unsympathetic protagonist do this all the time) or have them repentant and attempting to change. *Or* you have their flaws be endearing, and Amy's flaws have left the realm of cute and entered that of the annoying.

It's not really that I don't like Amy. I see a lot of potential in Amy. I see someone who became obsessed with the Doctor, someone who had their entire childhood ripped away by someone who didn't even notice. Someone who everybody thought was crazy, and just as she sewed her life back together her imaginary friend comes to life.

Someone who is torn between a life among the stars and a life she never had with her parents and with a family that loves her. Someone who craves adventure, but really needs a normal life.

*That's* a *fascinating* character. Absolutely brilliant. Sadly a lot of that is abandoned in favor of a generic brand ""bossy woman"" vibe that's been done a million times before but with a garish overzealousness that it's difficult to see the steak under the pile of salt.

Tell your friend that the eyes are the window to the soul. His right eye (looking at it, it's the one on the left) is looking straight at me with this wonderful intent while his left (the one on the right) is pointing off in the distance and is aligned much higher than the other.

It's not just the pupil, the entire left socket (looking at it the one on the right) is much too high, and this includes the placement of the eyebrow. Perhaps there was a slight flaw in the primary sketch, but it's rather evident in the final product.

This creates the impression of crossed eyes and looks a bit silly.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Monk changed one main character- Sharona after three seasons. Plus, it's not like Monk goes through assistants. He had two in the whole show. Natalie was around for even longer. So it's not like tv shows go around switching their main characters left and right. Doctor Who is atypical in that way. I mean, look what a hit House took when they did it.

The Doctor *did* tell Amy and Rory though. In the 2011 Christmas special. Just because he didn't think he should do it in the first place, doesn't mean you can change your mind. People do that all the time. He used to think that you couldn't ever alter time in his first incarnation, but now does it a lot. He wasn't going to genocide the Daleks in Genesis of the Daleks (have I the right?), but then goes to do it in the final episode (let's ignore the fact that it would've failed anyways).

Even after the Black Guardian arc, it's not like the Doctor was really running. For one thing, the BG could've found him at any time. For another, the BG was never even brought up again. While the new show casts a 'running' undertone to the series, there's no way this can be what the show is ""all about"". That's ridiculous. It's hardly mentioned. Casual viewers who don't follow every story or contemplate this stuff won't even notice. So is Doctor Who about the Doctor and his actions, his character, `or the character of the Doctor, or all the characters (of which you included monsters)?

Whether a characters flaws 'work' is entirely a personal opinion. So you don't like Amy's flaws, but they are addressed. Remember her prejudice against gangers in series 6? She refuses to admit it until the end when the Doctor proves it to her. And as you yourself pointed out, her obsession with the Doctor passed, she dealt with her relationship with Rory and her family. But it's not like a person can have character development every story. She's had a bunch of it, but people don't change that drastically every day of their lives.

Besides, you said she had potential. You said that she was a fascinating character which has abandoned for a generic brand.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;In May 2003 Enstrom and Kabat “shook the floors” of the international antismoking establishment by publishing one of the largest studies ever conduced on passive smoke: Environmental tobacco smoke and tobacco related mortality in a prospective study of Californians, 1960-98. The study was a longitudinal one, examining over 118,000 people from 1960 to 1998: 
&gt;
&gt;*""The results do not support a causal relation between environmental tobacco smoke and tobacco related mortality, although they do not rule out a small effect. The association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and coronary heart disease and lung cancer may be
&gt;considerably weaker than generally believed,""*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;In spite of its enormous size and duration, the study was not statistically significant. **Enstrom and Kabat proved conclusively the only thing that seems can be proven about passive smoke: its “dangers” cannot be demonstrated.**
&gt;
&gt;In 1999 it became clear that the data was not showing the “expected” results. In spite of tremendous pressures to suppress the study, the two scientists refused to do so, and the funds suddenly dried up. At this point, Enstrom and Kabat had no choice but to turn to the Center for Indoor Air Research – a group supported by the tobacco industry – to obtain the $75,000 necessary to complete the study. After that, the financing of the tobacco industry was used as a reason by scientific journals not to publish the results. 

There was a Penn and Teller Bullshit episode about it, there's several books. Most stuff about passive smoking is absolute bollocks.

I suppose it's because we never knew why the Doctor really got going on his adventures. Why he's always been hopping about. We've always assumed that's just who he is, but as we go on, as we continue we learn more. We learn what the Doctor was thinking all those years, what was motivating him. It's retroactive, yes, but in hindsight it's clear. HE moved to forget. To just keep pressing on and fighting bad guys and preventing tea from getting cold.

But even Donna went from an annoying and spoiled loud-mouth to a thoughtful and fun companion. She didn't totally change into a different person, but it was clear that she had matured.

Even with all the trails she's been through, most of Amy's changes have been superficial and haven't fundamentally pushed her in a new direction. She's still bossy. She still talks to the 900 year old Time Lord like he's an idiot and *she's* the sensible one. She still takes Rory for granted, even though he saves her life a bajillion times. He flaws, the distracting flaws that detract from the character instead of adding dimension, haven't been changed. She still plans on following the Doctor around, she still plans on being bossy and rude and entitled. There's no real change in a meaningful way.

It's not that I don't like Amy, so she's decaying. It's Amy's decaying, so I don't like her character. It's reactionary, not decreeing judgement. I get that this is opinion, but this isn't me just taking umbridge on personal grounds. This isn't a ""I like Rory, and Amy's mean to Rory, so I don't like her"" or ""she hits on the Doctor, and nobody does that except for Rose/River/the TARDIS"".

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans/companions along with him to see alien worlds and history. We've had approximately 784 episodes (32 seasons) but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in nearly anywhere.

The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a you will like. Don't like the eleventh Doctor? Try the tenth! Also, Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 (seasons 1-26) then relaunched in 2005 (seasons 27-32/series 1-6).

But by no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv, then I can give you this guide I wrote...). You should choose the 2005 point.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

And no matter what you do, watch all six series. And if you like them, there's always classic who... :D",0,1333592084,null,0,false,0,c48mqiu,t3_rtz5g,t1_c48mqiu,t3_rtz5g,null,1428658182,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

And that really was my point. It's less about what the Doctor does so much as what the show does. Doctor Who is marked for it's superb ability to adapt and change itself almost completely. To stick with a companion this long, particularly a companion that's not really being adapted or progressing, is the exact opposite of the show's very nature.

Yes, her first episode. Which was, to be fair, a feature-length special. She stays bossy, but she knows the line. Get ribs him like one would do to an old chum, not berates him like a wife would their absent-minded husband.

Amy says lines so absolutely self-centered that Donna could have never pulled them off. In Cold Blood her Silurian captor (someone who surely has no clue who Amy Pond is *at all* and obviously is just learning about humans) shushes her, to which she responds ""Did you just shush me? You don't shush me. Do you know who I am? I'm *Amy Pond*"".

Even the Doctor, who has every right to be pigheaded and often will use his title to scare people off, won't say ""Do you know who I am? I'm *the Doctor*."". No one would, not realistically at least.

And in the very same episode Amy has the entire fate of both humanity *and* the Silurians placed on her backs. She knows how many lives are at stake. She's seen the scale the Doctor deals on. Surely she would understand this monumental occasion requires an incredible amount of her attention, at least utilizing her acting abilities she used in Eleventh Hour to appear like an official who knows what they're talking about.

Nope, just crosses her arms over her head like a bored middle-schooler. That's not helping her character. That's not adding anything. That's just making her less likable while every other episode tries desperately to ingratiate her to the audience, trying to make her look like the best thing since sliced bread, like some sort of iconic figure on-par with the Doctor. 

But she hasn't earned that title, and her continued stay only underscores this. If she were to leave we could get to missing her and have her become something beloved, something we all miss. But the stop-start-stop-start goodbyes lessen the impact. It would seem at this point the only finality of a goodbye the show could service is outright killing her off, which they'd no doubt make a big show of.",0,1333592449,null,0,false,0,c48mt56,t3_rtgmj,t1_c48mt56,t1_c48mml6,null,1428658217,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

Disagree completely. This game was pretty much a given that we would progress. We were winning 2-0 on aggregate to a 10 man team. Why would we push it and risk injury/suspension, especially when we have the month from hell ahead in terms of fixtures.

After playing with such quality Valencia/Napoli, we deserve to be in this competition. We will turn it up against Barca no question.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Scientists aren't all about learning new things. We need scientists to do things we already know how to do. Daleks need scientists to build weapons, ships, Dalek casings, genetics (to keep em pure or what not), run the machines. The Cult of Skaro's problem wasn't that they were tacticians or scientists, their problem was that they were using ""un-Dalek"" thinking to come up with their tactics and accepting ideas that went against Dalek beliefs. Daleks aren't averse to knowledge or new methods to kill, they're just averse to anything that goes against their belief in their own superiority.

The Daleks didn't intentionally create different voices just as humans don't. I mean sure, they alter their DNA to get the certain results they want, but if they don't care about voices, why bother wasting more time editing that part of the DNA? Just leave it there, it's not relevant to Dalek purity.

Having different titles designates the Daleks' main function. They all have the prime directive to kill, but then they also have their main duties. Some Daleks' duties are to do sciency things, others are mainly the killers/soldiers, and we've got an Eternal (whatever that's for), etc.

I mean seriously. If all Daleks are the same (in all ways that matter) how do you decide who does what? If everybody can do the job equally well, who does what? Daleks aren't exactly designed to have free well, volunteer, randomly pick and choose. They're probably given their designation from the moment they're ""born"". They're probably ""bred"" for their specific designation. Their genetics aren't any different, it's just a way of organizing ranks.

It's like asking, if all Daleks are the same, why is there always a Dalek leader/emperor? Because someone has to coordinate, and you have to pick *someone* even if it doesn't matter who you choose.",0,1333595558,null,0,false,0,c48nfcm,t3_rtr0x,t1_c48nfcm,t1_c48mv4j,null,1428658507,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,Aidizzle,yorkshire,Bradfordian in Manchester,"Nigel Farage is assuming we can get similar deals with regards to trade as nations in the EFTA (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein) which we ourselves were actually a member of before we joined the EU. For a nation of the UK's stature, EFTA nations probably wouldn't have any issues with us joining their club, it's not bad company to be in.

If the EU did push to be a more federal body, we probably would leave, the UK is far too sceptical to be absorbed any further into the European system, there would be trouble. I think the Germans and French will do what they can to accommodate us though, they don't want a comparatively stable nation like the UK leaving them to it.

I don't mean to cause any offence with this, but the loo roll you use today is more likely to be statistically accurate than the Daily Star.

The Office of National Statistics are quite open with their data, [this excel document was published in February regarding population data between July 2010 and June 2011:](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/february-2012/population-by-country-of-birth-and-nationality.xls) 

From this you can see that 619,000 Poles are estimated to live here, less than 1% of the population of the UK, Ireland is second with 360,000 (which is over 5% of Ireland's population living here. If you added up all the migrants from Poland, Ireland, India and Pakistan, the UK gained 103,000 citizens over a calendar year.

America is 5th on the list, we gained 16,000 of them in a year. In the list of our top five migrants, only two of them are EU states. 6,7 &amp; 8 are France, Italy and Germany, hardly the begging bowls of Europe (well, keep your eye on Italy). We did gain a lot of Polish migrants in the first year or so of their EU membership, but they'll either slot in like the Irish/Afro Caribbean/Asian communities have, or go back to their homeland. Being in the EU does not cause us to be drowning in immigrants by any stretch.

UKIP are a party of the right, a euro-sceptic wing of the Conservatives generally. There isn't a viable left or centre anti-Europe option so I understand your problem, but do bear that in mind, you're not just voting against Europe, they have some weirdos in the grouping who've said some pretty sexist/homophobic stuff in their time.

I live in Bradford and went to school with many Asian lads. Not once did they ever disrespect any sort of remembrance service, they spoke in English in lessons unless there was a rude joke they didn't want the teacher to listen in in (Fair game I'd say!) 

If they were all white, would the people of Toxteth and Wavetree being greeting each other? 

There are undoubtedly language barriers within the older generation, but in the youth of today we have bi-lingual citizens, who can certainly achieve. There's a Primary School in Bradford where just 26 children out of 700 speak English as their first language. Doomed to fail you'd think? Not so, they're in the top 25% in the country in results. This is a standard primary school, no special money.

There are a lot of fears put about about the European Union, some of them are justified, but on the immigration front, it's cobblers as far as I'm concerned. First generation migrants always struggle and issues flare up, in 20 years time, Eastern Europeans will just be another element of our schools, and as Byron School shows, that doesn't have to be a bad thing.",0,1333595710,null,0,false,0,c48ngf5,t3_rsp10,t1_c48ngf5,t1_c48loq0,null,1428658520,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

When you didn't see them, they didn't just move, they stopped becoming real. They became something indestructible, something unimaginably fast and incomprehensible in form.

And the Flesh and Stone comes around. Now Angels can look at other Angels and things are fine. Now you can just ""pretend"" to look at them (despite having obviously closed eyes) and they won't call your bluff. And now they move, which is silly.

So many other enemies have the tired ""they'll make you one of them"" thing and Blink had people stare at an Angel's eyes all the time with no ill effects, so the ""image in your head becomes an Angel"" thing is a bit over-the-top and silly.

I always assumed that the point of Dalek supremacy (or at least the point of a pure Dalek) is that each one is an embodiment of the best-of-the-best. That is to say that one Paradigm Dalek is the best at science, and tactics, and... being... eternal. Each one is supposed to be the absolute best, so why do some have specializations? That implies that Scientist Dalek is better at science than Tactician Dalek.

And I suppose you address this. Just being branded at birth certainly seems Dalek, but why even have the titles? Oh well, I suppose that it's a secondary squabble decorating the real flaw: the color.

If I could take anyone at the moment it would be Laurent Blanc, but convincing him to leave France so soon after taking over would be tricky, but it's not unheard of for a manager at such a relatively early stage of his career.

And really, it's only 2.5 seasons out of 33+. Plus, you keep changing your argument. You said what the Doctor did was what the show was all about. Now it's not what the Doctor does, but what the show does.

Yeah, Amy's more self-centered than other companions. It doesn't bother me that much. This is once again just down to personal preference. But you know, the Doctor *does* do that. He doesn't say those exact words, but he's much more grandiose and show offy. Forest of the Dead, Eleventh Hour are both ones in which he uses his name in a very dramatic way. Plus his Pandorica speech. The Doctor has always been super arrogant. 

She's putting her hands on her head because she's exhausted and hey, it's not like it's easy to work out a negotiation between your species and the one that's been living under you for thousands of years. It's exhausting business.

&gt;That's just making her less likable while every other episode tries desperately to ingratiate her to the audience, trying to make her look like the best thing since sliced bread, like some sort of iconic figure on-par with the Doctor.

Too much loaded language here. I accept your opinion. If anything though, all of Moffat's characters feel more forced. He does a lot of 'telling' us how awesome the characters are rather than 'showing'. His lines are witty and full of quips, and moves plots along fast, but his writing weakness has always been characters. I really like 11, but he's very commercial-hipster appeal to the audience with the right balance of eccentric-dorky-cute to win people over. The whole show is like that. But it's okay because I like them, and any problems I have with this run of Moffat's will be replaced with new problems I'll be having with the next show runner. Just accept it.

I mean honestly, I don't know why we're discussing this at this point. What are you trying to convince me of? I agree, Amy's more selfish and bossy than most companions. I'm fine with it, Rory's fine with it, the Doctor's fine with it, she's only going to be around for five more stories, what more can you ask for?

What I mean is that while the Doctor's the main focus of the show, and without him the show kind of crumbles, the nature of the show itself is that of change.

That's really what I was getting at by saying Amy's stay was contrary to the show's nature. That of change. The Doctor is an essential part of the show, the show's core even. But the show's *nature* is that of constant change, unlike any other show on television.

The Doctor will brag about what he's done, not who he is. Even in Silence in the Library all he says is ""look me up"". It's not the title that he leans on, it's his deeds that have formed a reputation, and he only uses it in a save-thousands-of-lives scenario. I agree that he's a braggart, but the particular flavor, that of being entitled and bossy without cause, isn't really him.

Yes, I too prefer to actually form my own thoughts about a character rather than constantly be given informed ability. I think your assessment of Eleven is very astute. I really hadn't verbalized it in that way, but I do think you're right. And this doesn't mean I don't like Eleven. In many ways I do.

I think the reason he is being down voted is because of the shit that went down the last time we faced Barcelona and also because of the rest of his comments he left. Chelsea fans can never forget it and they feel a sting every time a Barcelona fan talks about Chelsea or challenging Chelsea or even if they talk about how they rule the footballing world.

It is also fueled by the fact that Barcelona have really not had the upper hand over Chelsea in recent years. They might have been running rampant all over world football but when it came to Chelsea we have always been better against them than most teams.

It has been 6 years since we lost a match against Barcelona. The last time either team out scored the other, it was Chelsea in 06. The matches have been far from friendly affairs either.

On the other hand, when the writers REALLY let them cut loose, they've absolutely horrifying just because they have no scruples whatsoever. 

I think the key to writing a good Dalek story pretty much requires the writers to embrace both of these aspects.  You lull the audience into a false sense of security with the silliness, and then kick them in the crotch with something just completely awful.  Like in Eccleston's ""Dalek,"" when the Dalek totally slaughters an entire room full of soldiers, complete with that electric floor trick.  Genesis of the Daleks would be another good example, even though the Daleks themselves are a sideshow, due to just how far Davros was willing to go in creating them.

The problem is, BAD Dalek stories (Daleks in Manhattan, Victory of the Daleks) just have them standing around talking without actually *doing* anything.  Then they're just stupid and campy.

I actually like that she questions the Doctor, because being 900 years old doesn't make you infallible.  I actually found Donna far less likeable, but that doesn't mean that I thought she was characterized terribly.

Furthermore, Amy does become pretty central, and getting a bit egotistical seems like a natural conclusion.  Look at what's happened to her, especially in S6:  Unlike with Rose, Donna, and Martha, Amy actually *is* a central part of the universe in some ways.  While she doesn't know that she's River Song's mother or who River Song is, there are enough big plot points that revolve around her, as in The Pandorica Opens and the mysterious one-eyed woman she sees all through S6 that no one else can see.  They go to see the Flesh technology because the Doctor thinks it might have something to do with her.  When you have a 900 year old Time Lord who is apparently attached enough to you that your memories can be used as bait, I'd imagine even someone who wasn't initially bossy could become a little self-absorbed.  So I don't think she's been as static as you portray her, or rather, I think there's been a full-circle type change of perspective, kind of a dynamic staticness, if that makes any sense?

Anyway, I also don't get the ""running"" sense so much.  After all, the companions of the Doctors 9, 10, and 11 til this point have either been forced out of his world (Rose and Donna) or have chosen to leave (Martha).

I'm friends with a nurse who among other things does smear clinics. She told me she gets 12 -15 done in one hour. She is a practice nurse at a local surgery.

She was asked to go into the local district general hospital for some reason (Im not a medical proffessional) and apparently their *specialist* (PCT) did on average 3 smears per hour.

She also said recent, and coming changes make it much easier to refer people to the right places more quickly, and give more power to local surgeries. So instead of having to get on the bus for 9 miles to the district general, you can trot round the corner and get your procedure done at the Surgery.

But personally, I applaud that Facebookers are finding creative ways to protest but I say fuck doing this just for a whole 24 hour period. It would make 25,000 times greater sense as a protest movement to forward your emails not only to Theresa May but also to the entire Tory/Lib Dem cabinet until plans for the surveilance laws are scrapped or if already passed, revoked.

The student protests and the Tottenham Riots have proven that a sporadic moment of protest as opposed to a continued protest movement doesn't change anything here in Britain.

In fact, the student protests virtually ended in defeat when the tuition fee rises were passed in Parliament. If students were truly as politically motivated as people suggested they were, they would have continued protesting even after the law passed, or would have intensified protests. Instead, just like wimps, they quit, vowing never to vote Liberal Democrat, or probably even exercise their right to vote ever again.

Hell.... let's look to a US example. SOPA provoked one strike where a few thousand nerds gathered to express their disdain. A few senators dropped support for the bill and the bill was dropped..... for a few months before a new version was simply drafted and is now being pushed again.

IF we're talking about the whole Doctor Universe (In the same way that we talk about the Buffy Universe which includes the show angel) then I would love to delete Children of Earth from Torchwood, not because it was bad, In reality it was one of the best mini series I've ever watched, but I am not okay with the fact that certain people who shall remain nameless did not make it out alive. It still pisses me off quite a bit to the point that I was reading a fan fiction the other day and it came to that section, although a few things were changed about it, and I had to stop reading it because I don't think I could go through those scenes again, they are too powerful and too hurtful. I don't think I could ever watch Children of Earth again, it just hurts way to damn much. 

If I have to stay in the Doctor Who show, I would probably delete Father's day. because it doesn't make sense with the rest of the show. The wayvren things don't show up when Rose comes back to the universe, or leaves the universe, they don't show up when the doctor is supposed to die and doesn't and they don't show up with the doctor saves the woman in Waters on Mars, so why do they show up with Rose saves her dad?

true,Lil_Boots1,smith,Smith,"Rose didn't have Amy's disposition and Donna couldn't know she was a human-Time Lord hybrid, so of course neither of them let it go to their heads.  Furthermore, not liking a character and saying that the character is ""decaying"" are two different things.  It's perfectly fine to not like Amy, but I think her character has developed, just not necessarily in directions you like.

Since I'm talking specifically about Amy's character development, we have to see it from Amy's perspective.  She knows nothing about Rose or Donna or anyone who came before her.  She doesn't know that other people have been used against the Doctor or have had special relationships with him; all she knows is that right now, she's important enough to him that someone would use her.  Whether or not the Pandorica Alliance needed to make Roman Soldiers from Amy's memories doesn't really matter.  The point is that they did and Amy knows it, so she would feel like the center of the universe, even if she wasn't.  

I'm pretty sure that Amy won't leave the Doctor of her own accord, so he will eventually have to let her go to keep her alive or let her get killed. That said, I don't think allowing Amy to last 2.5 seasons is a terrible thing.  As others have said, it's not much longer than Rose got, and just because you liked Rose better doesn't mean she's a more legitimate character than Amy.  

I don't think 2.5 seasons is unreasonably long for a companion, and while it might be irritating if she's not your cup of tea, complaining that the writers aren't sticking to their guns doesn't exactly make sense, either.  Do you know what they had planned when they wrote all of last season?  Maybe they planned for the Doctor to intend to have a final good-bye, but they wanted to make things more complicated.  When you say things like, ""Amy and Rory were never supposed to know he was alive,"" you're saying them from the Doctor's perspective, not from the writers' perspective.

From her perspective, I'd imagine that it's hard to avoid feeling entitled to the Doctor anyway, especially now that we know she's his mother-in-law.  Whether or not you like the way that part of the plot was devised doesn't undo it, and I'm not arguing on that point, really, though I kind of enjoyed it in spite of the plot holes.  I like Dr. Who mostly because it requires me to suspend my disbelief for a while, and I don't search out holes or hate the slightly forced resolutions it often comes to.  If it's your cup of tea, go for it, but I think you're underestimating Amy's character development because it's not what you would have written.

true,notadutchboy,null,null,"Let's play devil's advocate here:

The issue, if there is one, is not with Amazon, but with UK tax laws. On the surface, it appears they've structured their business in accordance with the law. However, while this is an intriguing and creative arrangement, the implication that Amazon's UK ""delivery business"" doesn't contribute to the UK economy at all seems false. The fact they employ &gt;2000 people in the UK means that they will be contributing both directly and indirectly to the UK economy through payroll taxes as well as helping prop up Royal Mail, or whatever other delivery companies they use.

The thing that nobody's mentioned is that Amazon's UK delivery business is a legitimate one. Amazon EU Sarl isn't their only customer; if they were, it'd clearly be a sham. But if one were an online retailer and wanted to store stock in their delivery center, and have it shipped when orders arrive, it's possible to buy this [service](http://services.amazon.co.uk/services/fulfilment-by-amazon/features-benefits/) from Amazon.

The error that the Guardian has made is calling Amazon a UK retailer, which they're not. They're a foreign company that owns and uses a legitimate delivery company in the UK that employs thousands and does contribute to the UK economy.

The Guardian has also implied that Amazon's revenues are relevant to their tax bill. This isn't the case as taxes are due on profits after variable costs, fixed costs, depreciation, amortization, interest payments, and foreign currency exchange losses (or gains) have been accounted for. In addition, they can subtract losses from former years. As Amazon isn't especially profitable, even if they were a bona fide retailer in the UK, the amount of corporation tax they'd pay would be zero (because of prior years' net losses), or marginal due to their low net profit margin.

Lastly, Amazon aren't really retailers anyway. A little known fact about Amazon is their business isn't generally about making a direct profit from the things they sell. In many cases their sell at break even or a slight loss. They make their money by investing the huge sums of money they collect from customers before they have to pay their suppliers. They're really an investment firm that invests capital borrowed at 0% interest.

Another option is to subscribe here [http://www.foxsoccer2go.com/](http://www.foxsoccer2go.com/) It has a starting monthly fee of $10, then I think 19$ a month. This will also have all the Liverpool games (and are in HD). So I just plug a HDMI into my laptop into my TV and BOOM Liverpool in HD.

The last option, which is free, is to check out the match threads on here or [/r/soccer](/r/soccer) there will always be a stream listed and you can use that for games.

Anyway the next game is Saturday against Aston Villa, hopefully this slump will end and we can get some wins

Anyways, I would never turn want to turn someone away from following the great LFC.  As a new supporter, you should really check out the side bar.  There is a lot of great links that will help get you up to speed.  You would probably want to know a little bit about the club before you shell out the cash on a jersey.  

Watching games can be a bit tricky.  Fox Soccer Channel has the best coverage of LFC but not everyone gets it with their package.  My suggestion would be to come to this subreddit during matches and looking for the game threads.  There will always be links to places where you can stream the games.  Also, there are places where you can download/torrent games.

true,joshcandoit4,lfc55,,"Just so you know what your in for, being a Liverpool fan right now is an emotional roller coaster ride. But worth it! We have arguably the most history out of any other English teams and are historically either the most successful or second most successful depending on who's counting. But we have been in a slump the last few years, and still currently are in league play. We did just win our first trophy since 2006 (for the Carling cup, unfortunately the least important of the year) and are on track to win another (the more prestigious FA cup. Understanding all of the competitions takes a little while when you are used to the American version of sports, I had to go through it as well, but it is easy to understand). Sorry you missed it, it was a wonderful feeling. 

Given our history, most fans, such as myself, wont consider us out of this ""slump"" until we finish in the top 4 of the league, and therefore qualify for the UEFA Champions League (the biggest competition in Europe). There were hopes early on this season that we would this year, but one fan to another this is highly doubtful, maybe even impossible barring a miracle. 

Also, we have had a lot of bad press this year, with one of our best players being called a racist by every news organization in England. It was a very over hyped story and basically every fan of most other popular team hates him (Luis Suarez) blindly and associates us with him. I, for one don't mind the hate, just be prepared to see a lot of bullshit comments over in /r/soccer. 

Also, there is a good chance of us getting a new manager sometime soon. I don't agree with it, but it is probably going to happen, maybe this summer. Our current manager is a Liverpool legend but there is way too much negativity surrounding him right now due to several things you will find out.

Oh yeah, and in case you didn't know, this is your new love interest/hero/captain fantastic/idol [Steven Gerrard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gerrard).

The team is going through a bit of a rough patch.  Nothing drastic, but definitely have been performing below expectations the past couple years.  However, we're in a rebuilding phase with some great new owners, and the future looks bright.

Live sports are always better, so if you're near an MLS team I highly recommend seeing some games in person.  Tickets are quite cheap compared to other sports.

But no, really, following LFC is fun and intense. Meet the cast!

Reina: one of the top 3 GK in the league, not in form right now unfortunately.

Skrtel: Agger's partner in defense. Badass both on the pitch and in attitude.

Agger: the best defensive player in our team. His tattoos are as cool as his tackles.

Enrique: former newcastle LB, occasionally runs up to the attacking third. totally buff.

Johnson: token black guy. he's fast, runs fast, and is a good attacking RB.

Kelly: young upstart RB who is also fast and dangerous.

coates: young Uruguayan talent whose debut goal was totally kick ass. He's a CB

Carragher: aging LFC superstar who so far doesn't seem to be all that great but was one of the best a few years ago. he's a true red, even though he liked everton growing up.

lucas leiva: currently injured brazilian CDM, he used to be meh but has shown his potential and has us wanting him more. unfortunately he was injured so this team has kind of gone to shit because of it.

adam: I don't like him enough to introduce him to you. 

downing: LM with pace and ability, he had bad form but is now coming up nicely as a part of the team.

kuyt: dutch engine. reliable super substitute as of now but used to be really cool a few years ago.

shelvey: the dark lord. hairless but shows promise.

spearing: short unsuccessful clone of gerrard, who i'll go into more detail later. still young, shows promise, and is becoming an underdog favorite for many here.

jordan henderson: young CAM/RM who has decent passing skills but has failed to impress so far.

Steven Gerrard: a living legend. 31 years old but plays like it was yesterday. best crosses, best passes, best lofty balls, best goals, best long shots, best everything i've seen so far. he's the engine, the energizing talisman the team needs.

bellamy: pacy as fuck welshman with bad knees but hardworking spirit.

suarez: Uruguayan sensation, nominated 4th for ballon d'or and probably the most talented on the ball.

carroll: expensive as fuck unreliable player, though it could be due to a lot of factors. he's played very unusually and it most likely affects his form. when he wants to win however, he is impressive.

Bear in mind that the key phrase here is ""up to"". The cost of doing business in the UK is generally higher than it is in the US.

Even if it were £100m, which I strongly suspect is over inflated, their corporation tax revenue would account for 0.19% of the total corporation tax collected in the UK. Corporation tax accounts for 9% of the UK's total tax income. The vast amount of tax collected is through payroll (about 48% of total tax receipts), and VAT (15% of total tax income).

It wasn't just over-the-top flanderization, but it's also a completely stale, ancient gag that seems more like something out of Back to the Future 3.  I expect Doctor Who to be, well, more *clever* than that.

My appreciation for the current DW has been going downhill since Moffat took over, and it makes me sad because I really **want** to love it as much as I did during RTD's reign.  But most of the things I'm seeing about S7 are just making me worry more, rather than making me excited.  I simply don't trust that it's in good hands right now.

Although I also find myself wondering, is there anyone *better* than Moffat waiting in the wings, should he move on in another year or two?  Even poor Doctor Who is generally pretty good (choice episodes excepted) and it could certainly get far worse in the wrong hands...

[Here is a video](http://youtu.be/Wr79KF6rMpw) that has some highlights from the season so far, sort of a quick run through the range of emotions.

Below you can find some highlights of the players who are IMO our best at the moment:

[Steven Gerrard](http://youtu.be/Wx_q58bw7BI): Team captain, local lad who has been here his whole career, has taken the team by the scruff of the neck and dragged them to victory over and over.

[Luis Suarez](http://youtu.be/QKj0_PEJqVU): Joined midway through last season, he's a striker who is an amazing creative talent, often making chances for himself out of seemingly nothing. Controversy seems to follow him, but the fans stand with him (club motto is ""You'll Never Walk Alone"")

[Lucas Leiva](http://youtu.be/VxAbyj5_sDI): Defensive midfielder, his role is to break up opposition play, win the ball and turn our team from defense to offense. He had a rough time when he first came to Liverpool, many fans criticizing him as ""not good enough"". He persevered though and has become one of the best players in his position and on our team in general. Unfortunately he injured his ACL earlier this season and won't be back until next year, his presence is sorely missed.

A couple figures: Liverpool have won the Champions League/European Cup 5 times, the most of any English club. We've won the English League 18 times, one less than Manchester United who just surpassed us last season. The most successful years for Liverpool were in the 70's and 80's. Unfortunately, we have never won the Premier League which was formed in 1992, although we came very close in 2008/2009.

You say that these companies create low-skill employment. This is true, but the job wouldn't require any more skill if it were created by a small company. Not that many people *want* to be entrepreneurs either.

Demonizing large companies is fallacious. Companies that are expertly managed and successful tend to grow to be large. These companies all started out small---they didn't just pop into existence as a giant multi-national affair.

SMEs are able to compete with the likes of Amazon. Amazon haven't killed high street stores and there are countless UK e-businesses successfully selling the same products as Amazon.

Competition changes. Businesses come and businesses go. What the marketplace demands changes, and it is increasingly demanding knowledge workers. Change is just the way things are and culturally we seem to prefer large retailers that provide a consistent experience---they're filling a need small retailers don't. But look around: newsagents and independently owned corner stores still exist and serve different needs.

To say they are contributing to the UK taxes through employing people is disingenuous. Their rivals were doing just the same AND paying corporate tax. If they have created 1000 jobs for every destroyed 10,000. That certainly means paying less staff. Not that I am against online shopping.

Is Amazon a UK company? I guess it depends on how you define it. Boots the chemist is registered to a post box in Switzerland isn't it? I don't think that makes it Swiss. I can buy a product in the UK, from an amazon**.co.uk**, by a UK supplier, stored in a vast Amazon warehouse, organised in an Amazon data centre, all within the UK. But that's not a UK business? But a tiny book shop on the high street is a UK retailer?

About those profits. Are Amazon still not expanding and expecting to pay investors back at a later date? Are they are loss leading? Expanding to wipe out their rivals with aggressive pricing backed by huge international investment. This might be a good thing backed by a fantastic business plan but its does not mean their business plan should be supported by disproportionately low taxes. I can't be certain of that but I am suspicious of the meaning of their ""low profits.""

If people were not buying goods from the Amazon website, stored by Amazon would there be £7 billion in sales going through their accounts? Sounds like retail to me.

A lot of large UK businesses structure their affairs in a very tax efficient way. This isn't uncommon.

I don't really know whether they have destroyed ten jobs for every one they create. If you have a citation, that'd be awesome to see. However, let's assume it's true. The general trend since the industrial revolution has been one of increasing efficiencies in the workforce. Machines took the place of people, and now software is increasingly replacing jobs that used to be done manually. It doesn't mean that there are fewer jobs overall, it just means that the nature of the jobs has changed and become increasingly skilled. Instead of ten people doing data entry, for example, this unskilled job would be replaced by highly skilled software developers, a network admins, a sales reps, marketers, directors, tech support people, etc.

Jobs may be destroyed in one sector, but new sectors are created that create an increasing number of jobs that tend to be higher paid and increase the flow of money (and inflation too, unfortunately).

Is Amazon a UK company? Well, no. You aren't buying from a UK company. You're buying from a company in Luxembourg that in turn uses a completely separate fulfillment and shipping center in the UK. Anybody can own a .co.uk domain name and it doesn't create a tax nexus in the UK, just like a .com doesn't create a tax nexus in the US. The fact they have some British suppliers doesn't make them a British company either, no more than their Chinese suppliers makes them a Chinese company. Their European data center is in Dublin, not the UK either.

Amazon are expanding. A public company doesn't pay investors back, as the purchase of shares is not a loan. They can, if able, pay dividends as a way of distributing excess profits to the shareholders, but the primary value comes by way of what these shares can be sold for.

You'd think that low prices dominate. Research shows that they don't always, and not everybody wants the cheapest price. Some people feel intimidated by Amazon too. Remember that Amazon isn't just a retailer, but a marketplace for other retailers which is why you'll see ""53 new and used"" next to the Amazon product. Amazon don't even directly sell half the things they promote, and it's the small businesses that are succeeding by selling through Amazon's website.

They run their delivery center in the UK at very close to break even, and they've suffered a slight loss. This is because this delivery center isn't designed to make a profit, but to provide business services to another company that owns it.

Any business owner has the right to run their business how they like (so long as it's legal) even to the point of bankrupting it if they so choose. In this sense, Amazon have no duty to make their UK fulfillment center any more profitable than they desire.

true,ask0,null,null,"&gt;If Amazon didn't sell in the UK, you're right, there would be some other company that would grow to be huge and fill the void. However, don't you think they'd create a similar legal structure?

Absolutely but my  issue is that large businesses dominate the market due to a number of unfair advantages - making it more difficult for mom and pop  businesses to compete  or survive or bother starting up.

&gt;Not that many people want to be entrepreneurs either.

You lost me there.   Where did you get this from   There is enough people that do, that would fill the void.   Its a law of the free market.

&gt;SMEs are able to compete with the likes of Amazon. Amazon haven't killed high street stores 

High street stores are not doing well.  Look at the latest earning figures. (I would not go as far as to blame Amazon  for this but their business model - but somebody else is benefiting). 

&gt; there are countless UK e-businesses selling the same products as Amazon.

What percentage of the market do they have relative to Amazon and how much tax do they pay (would they pay). That is what I would like to see.


&gt;but the job wouldn't require any more skill if it were created by a small company

There is something wrong in a society where too much wealth is being concentrated to the top 1%.   

Its not a matter of skills, its about allowing more people to have a share in profits rather then be paid employees.   I would rather the market was  more fragmented giving more people a chance to be entrepreneurial  then merely low paid employees.








We should be fighting to create a society with a larger entrepreneurial   middle class - not arguing for the interests of large corporations.   They are not doing us any favours - they are making profit.  That is what drives  them.

Amazon is at a size where it should not continue to have any unfair advantages like tax avoidance.

The idea for the current packaging is to minimise the loss of sales from people not buying certain items, just because they are ashamed of looking cheap.

There actual figures, which I found [here](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=97664&amp;p=irol-reportsannual) show that in 2010 their net income from sales was $34,204bn (worldwide) and the net expenses was $32,798 (worldwide) which is a margin of 4.1% before other incomes.  Gross profit for 2010, it might be noted was $7,643bn at 22% (quoted in that document) from the investment of those monies.

Even so, as you rightly say they aren't doing anything illegal.

I'm a business owner.

What about the size of my bank balance? Should net worth be capped?

Should we all be equally wealthy irrespective of the choices we make and the risks we take? A successful entrepreneur made different choices to the guy that collects the garbage. Should they both be paid the same in order to create a more equal society? I honestly don't think so.

Legally these companies are not bound to directly contribute back to society through corporation tax, and I don't think that's right. The UK has created a lot of infrastructure that allows them to do business  successfully in the UK, and it costs money to maintain. Their taxes create education opportunities for the next generation, support those who cannot support themselves, and create a society that keeps us safe and relatively prosperous. The vast majority of taxes are paid by the average citizen, and I'm not sure how I feel about that.

I do think that Amazon should at least pay VAT as if they were domiciled in the UK, and it could be argued that by virtue of their closely held ""delivery company"" that they are liable to charge the prevailing rate. VAT is a major money-maker in the UK. Personally I'd be in favor of reducing income taxes and increasing consumption taxes.

Before I put my satan hat back on, I do genuinely believe that by keeping the UK a business friendly jurisdiction we're creating prosperity for the British even if we're ""cheated"" by companies who don't pay as much CT as they could.

&gt;They started out small, just like every presently large company.

That is absolute bullshit.   You cant be serious with that generalisation.

In the most cases it takes connections, capital, a network, a rich family, to start a business.   Obviously it depends on the industry.

Even Bezos was well connected having worked in the Hedge fund industry with access to capital.   He started  from a garage but it was never that small.


And it does not matter how they start out - what matters is how companies compete - sometimes unfairly and unethically eg Murdoch.

&gt;However, judging by actions, the vast majority of people don't want to be an entrepreneur

That is very patronising.  And just because 7% runs a  business does not mean more dont want to.


&gt;I strongly disagree that the person answering the phones should have a share in a business they didn't create.

That is not the argument, its about smaller businesses being able to compete.     The wealth goes to one company such as  Amazon instead of a larger number of companies within the  community who **would be paying some taxes** as opposed to **Amazon Not paying taxes**.
Local entrepreneurs would also be likely to spend money  in the community as opposed to Amazon that takes it out.

In theory, the NY purchaser must pay a ""use tax"" which is the equivalent of the sales tax that would otherwise be paid; this is rarely enforced.

The US' Supreme Court's rulings have no bearing on the UK. (Edit, I note you've changed the wording of your comment regarding this to significantly change the meaning. You originally worded it to imply that a Supreme Court ruling created an unfair advantage for British businesses.)

Name one large company that doesn't have small roots. Even if you can name one, the vast majority, even Walmart, started out small.

It does not take a rich family, a network, or connections to start a business. It does take capital, but not millions as I seem to think you believe. Bootstrapped businesses are common and can grow quite large by self funding growth. There are lots of founders that have self-funded.

The fact he worked as a software/network developer in finance doesn't equate to automatic privilege. I have connections with a hot investment banker that used to be my fuck buddy. Doesn't mean capital flowed my way. (Heh.)

I'm not sure how big one can be when starting from a garage. The logical reasoning behind your assertion is a mystery to me.

It's not patronizing to say that the vast majority of people don't want to be an entrepreneur. It's scary, it's exceptionally hard work, it's relatively very risky, and failure is all but guaranteed in the early days. There are some people that are drawn to it, and many more that aren't. There's nothing inherently wrong with not wanting to be an entrepreneur.

Generally people that want to do something badly enough proceed to do it. A vague desire to ""run one's own business"" isn't the same as actually doing it. I have a vague desire to do a lot of things but I'm not serious enough to commit to doing them.

Self employment doesn't necessarily equate to higher net income either. The top line may be higher, but after expense and taxes, it's not a whole lot different to being an employee. The difference is that being self employed you have to be good at many different skills (some of which might not be enjoyable) rather than being able to do one or two things really well that are enjoyable. For example, not every self employed person likes to sell.

Small business can and do compete, and Amazon do pay taxes even in the UK through their payroll. The fact they're heavy users of delivery companies further increases the taxes they're indirectly paying.

Bear in mind that many of the world's largest companies have their roots in the UK. Are they taking wealth out of the US and spending it in UK communities too?

No I'm not a PR firm. Occasionally I'm playing devil's advocate, but I broadly believe in what I'm saying especially when my outlook is backed by fact. However, not once have I said that the free market is perfect. It needs oversight, but capitalism is far better than the pseudo-communism you seem to be arguing for.

We're all responsible for our own success. Your bank balance is a product of your actions, as is mine, and contrary to what you appear to believe, wealth is generally not a product of misdeeds.

For what it's worth, Amazon does create jobs and does generate revenue via VAT on everything it sells as well as spreading cash to mail and courier firms. I'm not sure what a society with an entrepreneurial middle class would really do; you'd still end up with a concentration of wealth overseas as business owners become wealthy enough to hire good accountants.

Shareholders won't pay more tax, but the share of the company will be worth less if it loses revenue to taxation.

 Headline: X is happening.

 Your response: I wonder how X effects the rich and their privileged lifestyle?

 Don't get me wrong, I take your point, and for some context I recently used that article on BBC news to work out how much I earn.  I earn 35% of the national average, and I am currently paying for a Masters, so yes, I do know what poverty is.  

 However, I think rare plants should definitely get concessions (perhaps as long as they have some public aid or access and don't selfishly benefit just the guy that owns them).  Golf courses?  Perhaps they should be allowed enough to keep the grass alive, but not as much as they need to keep them in perfect condition.  Losing an entire golf course of turf would benefit no one at all in the long run, and would detract from the beauty of an area (Maybe you don't think that's important, but I think the aesthetic of an area is vital... unless you don't mind all of the UK looking and feeling like an estate in Slough just so everyone can be equally miserable)(Disclaimer: No offence to Slough, I'm just illustrating a point).

No, my response was 'How does this affect golf courses and stately homes?'. Reading comprehension - try it. It's just as applicable to a stately home run by English Heritage, or a council run golf course. YOU are the one trying to paint this as an attack on 'the rich and their privileged lifestyle'.

&gt;Don't get me wrong, I take your point, and for some context I recently used that article on BBC news to work out how much I earn. I earn 35% of the national average, and I am currently paying for a Masters, so yes, I do know what poverty is. 

Poverty? What is this I don't even... ?

You would 'automatically assume'. I wouldn't. That's why I asked the question. I've not speculated on anything. As far as you are aware 'no one actually knows'? This subreddit has 20k+ subscribers - I don't think it was unreasonable of me to expect that a few of them may have worked on a golf course before. It sounds to me like you're the one speculating.

I have heard some say that a more honest tax would be a direct money transaction tax that only happens at the point of sale to a private customer (not another business).

&gt;Poverty? What is this I don't even... ?

This was me giving you context for my opinion.  I was assuming your next aggressive response to me was going to be some line of attack on how I was unhappy about my daddy sitting in his stately home, with his rare plant collection and playing golf, minding his own business, and having to deal with people like you - which clearly, is not the case.

Yes I would automatically assume that people are abiding to the law.  I think this is the best way to be, unless of course you prefer a 'guilty until proven innocent' society?  Why would I assume as a standard that people are breaking the law?

true,TakenByVultures,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"&gt;I am unaware of anyone who is not rich that owns a stately home. Because you lumped in things such as 'stately homes and golf courses', I made what I assumed to be reasonable deduction. Clearly I was way off the mark. Perhaps you could be a little more clear?

I thought the question was worded clearly enough. I've had a good reply from TeleSavalas and a link to a recent article from chris1710 - both were more useful responses than yours.

&gt;This was me giving you context for my opinion. I was assuming your next aggressive response to me was going to be some line of attack on how I was unhappy about my daddy sitting in his stately home, with his rare plant collection and playing golf, minding his own business, and having to deal with people like you - which clearly, is not the case.

Again with the assumptions and unrelated waffle.

&gt;Yes I would automatically assume that people are abiding to the law. I think this is the best way to be, unless of course you prefer a 'guilty until proven innocent' society? Why would I assume as a standard that people are breaking the law? I suspect your honest intention with your comment was actually to get some free karma from other redditors that will upvote on the grounds that they too are instantly sceptical of how public initiatives will have varying effects on rich and poor.

It wasn't clear, to me, how such hosepipe bans applied to those who need/use large amounts of water on a regular basis. Again, that's why I asked the question.

&gt;Oh I see, you're looking for that guy who looks after rare plants, has a stately home, and is a care taker for a golf course. Again, I suspect your intention was not to get this 'question' answered at all.

It was, and it has been. Again - on a subreddit with 20k subscribers, I don't think it was unreasonable to expect that someone had worked on a golf course. You're intentionally rewording my question to be obtuse.

&gt;I think I'll do as I please.

 A link to the peer reviewed Enstrom and Kabat paper, from that conspiracy nuts palace the British Medical Journal: http://www.bmj.com/content/326/7398/1057.full

Another study, the Lufthansa flight attendent study, 

&gt;""A sizeable longitudinal study was published by the American Journal of Epidemiology on May 1, 2002: Mortality from Cancer and Other Causes among Airline Cabin Attendants in Germany, 1960–1997. Completed in 1997, the study followed 16,014 women and 4,537 men, all Lufthansa flight attendants, for 37 years, monitoring for lung cancer. The peculiarity of this study is that it concerns the confined air cabin environment where fight attendants were exposed throughout their professional lives to passive smoking. (It is worth pointing out that, since smoking has been banned in airplanes, the air quality has significantly decreased because of the diminished air exchange.)
&gt;
&gt;The study concluded: “We found a rather remarkably low SMR for lung cancer among female cabin attendants and no increase for male cabin attendants, indicating that smoking and exposure to passive smoking may not play an important role in mortality in this group. Smoking during airplane flights was permitted in Germany until the mid-1990s, and smoking is still not banned on all charter flights. The risk of cardiovascular disease mortality for male and female air crew was surprisingly low (reaching statistical significance among women).”
&gt;
&gt;This study is not an isolated case. Other studies on airline cabin environment and passive smoke show similar results.

Perhaps, the widely accepted 1989 US Dot Study?

&gt;This direct-measurement study states that a passenger sitting in the row bordering with the smoking
&gt;section would have to fly non-stop for 48,440 hours (5 ½ years) to inhale the equivalent of one cigarette. The study also compares passive smoke with the exposure to cosmic rays (a bombardment we are all exposed to, even in caves), and states that cosmic rays constitute a risk of cancer from 150 to 641 times higher than passive smoking. 
&gt;

These are just the most accepted and popular studies into this. There are many, many, many that prove the same thing (Including a recent one on smoking in cars). I don't smoke. I hate smoking. Hate the smell, hate the taste, spent my whole childhood beggingmy father to stop, he never did.

I do however, hate being lied to in the face of conflicting evidence.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"I actually saw a lot of potential in Amy, and the first few stories teased a beautiful direction. 

A girl whose childhood was spent with no one believing her, going through five therapists and having her life degenerate around her. She grew up with no parents to speak of, no real chance to be a child. So she's been tearing herself apart all her life and just as she's stitched it all back together, her imaginary friend turns out to be real.

That level of slightly crazy, that idea of a character who the Doctor essentially broke, is *fantastically* interesting. We see them inform us of this ability. *Tell* us she's The Girl Who Waited without *showing us* what that means. You caught glimpses, slight glimpses, of a wholly unique and brilliant character.

And then she quickly devolved. When she wasn't the sexy object of sexy sex on the show she devolved into a nuisance. What was initial shock and indignation quickly became persistant and glaring character flaws.

Being a bit bossy is fine, but for Amy that's becoming her only character trait. Donna showed a level of genuinely being clever and a will to *die* if it mean saving the world. Amy shows a persistent indignation to anything that would oppose her, having an ego that rivals the Doctor's without having the 900+ years of kicking ass to back it up, and that's becoming her only characteristic.

Also, what does *a Dalek* gain from inflating Amy's ego? Trust me, it's not a Judoon or a Sontaran that wants to make her feel like the center of the universe. It's Moffat.

2.5 seasons *isn't* unreasonably long... if there's a reason to stay. But there isn't. I mean, what else is there to do with Amy and Rory? What more of there story is there to tell? We've slowly dried up their tales to the point where they're just regurgitating trite catchphrases and becoming cardboard cutouts of themselves. That's no good. It's at that stage that the show *desperately* needs fresh blood.

And I am speaking from a writer's perspective. They wrote the opportunity to start fresh and have change, and yet stagnation lingers and the window of opportunity is closed. Now the next goodbye is going to mean *Even less*, because you *already had one*. Right about now the only exit that will still have a punch to it is death, and I pray that they don't draw it out into a spectacle like they did for the pace-murdering erasure scene with Rory.

I suspend disbelief for Doctor Who all the time. It's a box that's bigger on the inside and flies through time. It's got a Doctor with two hearts who can turn into another man when he dies. They fight living shadows and Minotaurs that feed off ""emotional energy"". I suspend disbelief for those things all the time because the wacky science surrounding it's core doesn't matter.

Amidst all this phantasmagoria lies one thing that's always been real. The one thing that the entire show stands on and is the single most vital aspect of Doctor Who: the characters. You can make time travel make no sense, have fish that fly or dress as vampires or have 1969 America have White Dwarf metals. But if you make a character make no sense, then the entire illusion is shattered.

*That's* suspension of disbelief. Everything surrounding it can be completely impossible and contradictory and utterly insane, but if the person isn't real, if their actions make no sense, if they don't feel like a real person then the show just halts.

I really think that the whole anti advertising smoking campaign has gone overboard... when FREELY alcohol is plastered on TV,shops etc etc... but no one flips out about that. Nor do i think they should flip out about either alcohol or tobacco.. because it wont make any difference unless the audience watching these adverts have one brain cell between them and on a loop for hours there was a commercial with strobe lights and 90s acid house music pumping ""DRINK,SMOKE,COOL TIMES,DRINK,SMOKE,COOL TIMES"" 
then it wont make a difference. People are smart enough to make their own choices in life and the government really doesn't have to nanny us all into making choices FOR us.

The whole story is about a business that is selling a lot of stuff (indicated by a high sales figure) but it is not paying any tax (indicated by the zero tax figure). These two facts are the crux of the story, and therefore belong in the headline. 

How are these figures related? Why are they the crux? Because it is normal that in a healthy business - which judging by Amazons published financials is a reasonable assumption - that high sales usually equal a decent profit and therefore a decent tax bill. The fact that this is NOT the case is the cause for concern - this is the question the headline effectively raises. 

In this case, these seemingly contradictory figures (mentioned in the headline) turn out to be a VALID indicator that something 'fishy' is going on - the structure of the business in the UK is arranged to avoid paying any UK tax - which is a concern for UK Plc / HMRC / competing businesses where money is (in many peoples eyes) unjustly flowing out of the country and/or giving Amazon an 'unfair' competitive edge.

true,Rotgrub,null,null,"&gt;It's not weak at all. We vote for issues, just because we aren't in the main voting bloc is not the fault of Europe, its the fault of our stupid proud politicians.

The politicians are elected because they represent the UK sentiment.  Like it or not the majority of Britain voted for an anti-federalist EU sceptical party first and an anti-EU party second.  

It is as simple as that.  However unpleasant the popular UK sentiment is to you it is largely at odds with the rest of Europe.  The popular UK opinion is not well represented in the EU - as such the UK opinion is weak.

&gt;We agree with mostly everything that western europeans agree with. I challenge you to find one issue where the UK public is widely different to that of a european country, that can't be compared to a similar difference between two other european countries.

I'll give you several.  The spat before Christmas included that the UK wanted to increase bank regulation to make sure they banks had to carry more collateral.  The vast majority understands that a Tobin tax would not work for the UK.  The Common Fishing Policy does not work to the benefit of the UK fishing industry.  Our policy to agriculture and farming is fundamentally different to the mainland.  As is the UK policy on working hours.  France still shuts down for a couple of hours every day and everything is closed on Sundays, the opposite is true in the UK - they have more of a family orientated culture with small farm holdings.  The UK to use a pun is far more laissez-faire.  Culturally our cities, our farming and fishing communities, all run differently.  Even when most central countries accepted open borders and a common currency the average British person choked at the prospect. 

If you don't think the British as a whole doesn't have a different attitude to the rest of Europe head on over to r/Europe and ask other EU citizens what their impression of the UK's attitude to the EU is.  It's pretty universal that we're seen as behaving differently.  You might not like how the majority of British people feel, but that's not relevant, nor do I care.

&gt;So the EFD has 5% of the seats, thats how politics work. As I've said, I'd prefer directly voted for parties.

It doesn't change the fact that the overriding UK opinion is out in the cold compared to how other Europeans vote.  The UK is not on the same song sheet.  UK voting doesn't carry as well because we are fundamentally different in our outlooks.  It doesn't mean that any one side is right or wrong, it just means that there are big differences between how our people think and vote - and the EU is not indicative of how the UK votes.

&gt;The ECHR is our culture. We are a free society based on moral principles.

The ECHR is not part of the Europe Union.  It is not a body made up by the European Union.   It is not part of the European Parliament.  It is not part of the European Council.  It is part of the Council of Europe which is very much different from the European Council.  The Council of Europe has 47 member states.

Stop saying the ECHR is anything to do with the EU.  It is not.

&gt;Federalism does not automatically mean homogeneity. Otherwise Quebec would not be in Canada.

The want the same laws, the same currency, one commission writing all legislation, a president, a common trade policy, a common foreign policy, they actively argue for federalisation under one banner, and you're still going to argue it's about diversity and not homogeneity?  You're not being honest with yourself.  You can't have fiscal union and all these new offices under the Treaty of Lisbon and not move to a more homogeneous whole.

I don't support a team because they're winning.  If that was my criteria, I'd be a Real Madrid fan and a Manchester United fan.  I also tend to follow certain players more than specific teams.  Fernando Torres will always be my boy, and so will Messi, regardless of who they end up playing for.

In addition to Chelsea, I'm also a Barcelona fan because they play the most amazing style of football on the planet.  They just happen to be doing it better than most others at the moment.  Also, I fully subscribe to their youth development beliefs.  They built their mansion - they didn't buy it.  That's something that other clubs should admire (and copy).

Anyway, I'm not going to drone on about teams other than Chelsea here.  The Blues have what I think is easily their most difficult match of the season ahead of them.  There's no room for Bosingwa or Ivanovic against Barca - we are going to need our top defenders (Cahill, Terry, Cole, Luiz) and do our best to park the bus.  The midfield will have to work hard to drop back fast and shut down the passing lanes that Barca likes to exploit.  We'll need to stick two people on Messi to have a chance of shutting him down.

The Blues have what I think is easily their most difficult match of the season ahead of them. There's no room for Bosingwa or Ivanovic against Barca - we are going to need our top defenders (Cahill, Terry, Cole, Luiz) and do our best to park the bus. The midfield will have to work hard to drop back fast and shut down the passing lanes that Barca likes to exploit - the key to this is stifling the Xavi-Iniesta-Messi connection. We'll need to stick two people on Messi to have a chance of shutting him down.

AC Milan did all this perfectly against Barca at the San Siro. We won't have horrible pitch conditions on our side, but if we can do the same thing, we have a chance of winning.

Realistically, we should probably put Torres up top by himself and put everyone else back to add congestion.  Discipline is going to be paramount, which isn't our strong suit.  Even a draw will put us in good shape, I think.

Barca will always play out of trouble in the back, and that is their Achilles heel.  Strong pressure on them when the ball is in their backfield will result in rare mistakes. We will have very few opportunities to take advantage of that, so we need to punish them when mistakes do happen.",0,1333635287,null,0,true,0,c48rx8v,t3_ruhzm,t1_c48rx8v,t3_ruhzm,null,1428660625,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

We also maintain a rivalry with our neighbours Everton, but our matches against them is often referred to as the friendly derby.

Our greatest ever player is our current manager, Kenny Dalglish, affectionately called King Kenny. Our greatest ever manager was Bill Shankly, with Bob Paisley a close second. We are often referred to as ""The Reds"" and our stadium is called Anfield Road, where the most avid supporters usually are seated at the Kop stand.

true,Rotgrub,null,null,"&gt;I know the ECHR is nothing to do with the EU I'm just saying that it shows how we have similar ideals.

Similar ideals doesn't mean that we're not different in many other regards, and since one doesn't have to be part of the EU to share these ideals, or even have the same culture, it is an irrelevant point.

&gt;And eh, we do shut down on sundays for a few hours, most people agree with that.

You must be out in the boondocks if you don't have Sunday shopping.  We also have nothing like the restrictions on weekly working hours.

&gt; guess maybe france is too culturally different to be in the EU. 

Not only is that up to France to decide you make an irrelevant point in a puerile manner.

&gt;We actually have a rebate on CAP so I dont know why you're bringing it up.

The ever diminishing rebate which still leaves our farmers considerably out of pocket to their European counterparts concerning subsidies they receive?

I'm bringing it up because culturally British farms operate, and are set up, far differently traditionally than those in Europe where they have far more small holdings in relation to the land they have.  That also means they are less productive per farm but receive far more subsidy relative to landmass across the whole.

&gt; I really don't agree that we are fundamentally different to other europeans. I think thats just blatantly wrong.

Yet you're willing to admit our most popular elected European representatives are at odds to the popular voting blocs in Europe.  Clearly we have fundamentally different outlooks.  The majority of Europe is pro-EU and for consolidating more power and more common fiscal management, the majority of the UK is the opposite.

&gt;Also I don't know what planet you live on where federalism automatically means homogeneity. India, Canada, China and I'm sure numerous other states are states consisting of multiple peoples.

I didn't say automatically, I said it does in this case.  You bring up a drive for a common foreign policy, common trade policy outside the EU, common fiscal policy, a common currency and then try to argue that it is not moving to homogeneity.  You're tumbling mental backflips to not see your own doublethink. 

&gt;Of course there are differences between countries in europe, but they aren't as significant as you think.

Yet the majority of the UK, as per how they vote, disagree.  That's not to say they see Europe as their mortal enemies, or even that they don't regard them as friends, most people do.  They just don't see eye to eye with most Europeans when it comes to Europe - which is why Britain has a reputation for putting the brakes on when it comes to the EU.

&gt;Oh and btw, without the fishing policies we probably would've fished the sea dry. IMO the fishing policy is one of the good things that the EU has done.

The fishing policy has raped the UK waters.  It has introduced massive overfishing and waste through quotas.  It's also deeply insulting to the UK to think that it needed European politicians to step in and introduce a policy to look after UK resources.  You seem to think Europe has a higher caliber of politicians than the UK and I don't buy that for a second.  You're just not as familiar with their moral ineptitude as you are UK politicians.   

The CFP: a policy which with even the briefest of cursory glances at fishing towns shows to have been an unmitigated failure.  If you think the Common Fishing Policy has saved UK fishing then you know nothing of the state of UK fishing.  Quotas have led to fish being dumped overboard.  What's the advantage of allowing European vessles into UK waters and then allowing everybody to throw away half their catch once it has been killed?  Britain has a proud history of leading conservationism with a Royal Charter in 1949, ahead of its time.  It certainly doesn't need its hand held by Europe.  Admittedly there was an ongoing crisis before the CFP came into being but what we can say without hesitation is that the CFP has not worked even as the industry has collapsed.  According to [GreenPeace](http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/sosaction) Spain has received over a billion Euros in subsidies and with its largest industrial fishing fleet has set to work fishing UK waters dumping fish as per the quota system.  According to the [EU](http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/damanaki/headlines/speeches/2011/09/20110908-speech-us-iuu_en.pdf) in 2011 CFP subsidies and illegal fishing have been going hand in hand - it's 50 years old and it still hasn't found a working solution!  It's simple: no quotas, no dumping, controlled fleet sizes, controlled number of days at sea, *domestic fleet only*.  Problem solved.  It can't be done under the CFP though because they'd say that is protectionism.  Britain for the good of its natural resources needs to leave the CFP.  We're actively paying the corrupt Spanish fleet to attack our fishing stocks.

&gt; Any disagreement we have over the banking system is because we have invested so much into the banking system that it would be ridiculous to copy what other countries are doing who haven't got a banking system as big as ours.

So culturally we have adopted a uniquely different way of life in our cities, and introducing the bank levy shows an entirely different approach to a proposed Tobin tax.  The Tobin tax is top heavy and punitive to all, the bank levy provides freedom to operate whilst laying out ground rules so banks in future won't need bailing out.  It should have been in place years ago, but the EU trying to argue the UK should have a Tobin tax illustrates just how much interests are divergent.  It would be terrible for the UK, pretty good for mainland Europe although at the UK's expense - *again*.

There was one woman for example who didn't want to take a promotion because the additional money meant she would lose some housing benefit. The fact she was working no more hours and would be no worse off was completely irrelevant to her. As far as she was concerned, she should continue to get full housing benefit.

When Labour brought in the tax credits, I though it was a brilliant idea - reward people for working and make sure anyone who works has a minimum standard of living. Sadly instead the Tax Credits and other benefits have produced a nation where more people are in receipt of benefits than not. As a result, it has left a lot of people with a feeling of entitlement to benefits and the state providing for them instead of them providing for themselves with the attitude that anyone who does work harder is a mug for working for what they could get for doing less and getting topped up with tax credits.

I've voted Labour since the 80's. This next time I'll be voting Conservative because they're the only party with the ability to bring the benefits farce under control.

I thought it was original enough to warrant going back to the first episode (S1/E1 ""Rose"").

true,cptzaprowsdower,uk,Darlington,"I found this point interesting:

&gt;Some of the most important stories have involved breaking the rules in some way. For example, the Daily Telegraph’s exposé of the MPs’ expenses scandal was very clearly in the public interest, but only happened because the newspaper took the decision to pay for stolen data. They have been widely applauded – deservedly – for doing so.
Indeed, if it was looking for further examples, the Guardian could have found them much closer to home. Its respected investigative reporter David Leigh has admitted hacking a phone in pursuit of a story. The Guardian’s sister paper, the Observer, was found on more than 100 occasions to have commissioned information from a notorious private investigator, who was convicted in 2006 of illegally obtaining private data. In each case, a public interest justification has been claimed.

I particularly enjoyed his ""breaking the rules"" euphemism. 

My initial reaction to this was outrage, but in truth I don't really understand the laws surrounding this. Does Ryley have a point? Why is it acceptable to break the ~~law~~ rules in pursuit of a story that's ""in the public interest"" but not to hack into Tulisa's mobile phone and steal a sex tape or whatever? Who decides what the ""public interest"" is anyway? Personally I see the expenses scandal as a greater concern than a man fleecing his insurance company, but why should they be any different?

Hell, I am shocked that people still even **buy** The Sun, just because it has a nice pair of tits on page 3 every day. Want tits? Do a simple fucking Google search for them. Or hell.... since you're reading this comment on reddit, I'll recommend to you a subreddit for tits [that doesn't include the tripe that The Sun lobs at you like a monkey flinging shit (NSFW)](http://www.reddit.com/r/boobies/) It would save you a few pence too unless you're on one of those borderline criminal mobile internet data plans where you only get the data allowance for say.... a few YouTube videos a month, in that case why are you browsing for knockers during a commute? A passenger seat on a train or a bus isn't exactly an ideal place for some right (or left) handed action, is it?

Not only has NOTW been implicated within this but so has Sky News. How far does this corrupted chain of command actually go up? News Corp have shown that they cannot be trusted. I mean it's shitty enough that phones were hacked but police officers were bribed too?",0,1333646424,null,0,true,0,c48ucfv,t3_rui4n,t1_c48ucfv,t3_rui4n,null,1428661834,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

I'm just repeating myself:
