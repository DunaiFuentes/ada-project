As uninspiring as our performances have been lately, all is not lost, as many supporters (and the media I might add) make it seem. As stated, despite our recent dip in form, we still currently sit tied for 4th in points in the PL, are favorites to advance to the 6th round in the FA Cup, and have a fighters chance in the UCL with 3 weeks to prepare for a home match against Napoli. one might ask...what's your point? The point is, there is still SO MUCH to be competing for. And yet...our team has never seemed so dispirited. 

Aside from Juan Mata and (arguably) Petr Cech, almost every player has looked atrocious over the last month. We play with no confidence, no heart, no passion, no life. Chelsea haven't even been fun to watch. Now does AVB share some of this blame? Absolutely. But so do the players, and therein lies the problem for me. We have players in this squad that (seemingly) have the mindset of, ""if I/we don't like the manager, then why try? I/we are not motivated to win for this manager."" This entire mindset is complete bullshit. These players' egos are dragging this club through the mud, and AVB (or whomever is hired if we fire him) will not be able to succeed until this mindset is eradicated from the club.

You dreams about the Doctor aren't weird. I think everyone here can attest to that, especially in times where you just want to run away from anything and everything and start new.

The one thing that I will say is I raised an eyebrow at your ""I've found the woman I'm going to marry"" part. Marriage is not something to consider lightly, and I would make sure you connected with this girl emotionally (which it sounds like it), habitually, and that you can communicate to one another effectively at any time or at least can recognize and respect when one of you can't temporarily. Too many people jump into marriage with bad results. If you have any hesitation, consider them seriously. You are 22 years old and have a LOT of time ahead of you to consider marriage. You sound emotional right now, and I heartily ask that you consider your current thoughts when you are in a neutral, unbiased state of mind and even after you have an argument with this girl. What goes through your head when you're not happy with her can be extremely telling of your subconscious relationship.

I don't know your relationship with this girl or how long it's been going on, but I've seen what happens when people throw themselves into marriage, and the results are hardly ever pretty.

Doc1: One of my favorites. He has a rough start, but he's awesome by the end of the first Dalek story. Best stories: The Aztecs, The Dalek Invasion of Earth, The Romans, The Time Meddler

Doc2: Actually one of the funniest Doctors. Has the best companion chemistry of all Doctors, classic or new. Best stories: Tomb of the Cybermen, The Enemy of the World, The Invasion, The War Games

Doc3: A bit gruff and a bit of a dandy. Much more military action than before. Best stories: Spearhead From Space, Inferno, Terror of the Autons, The Green Death

Doc4: The most popular, but has some of the weakest stories overall (probably from just having so damn many). Fun to watch none the less. Best stories: Pyramids of Mars, The Deadly Assassin, The Talons of Weng-Chiang, Logopolis

Doc5: Young and sympathetic. Vulnerable but determined. Full of contradictions. Best stories: The Visitation, Earthshock, Resurrection of the Daleks, Caves of Androzani

Doc6: Abrasive, horrible costume, and just weird. He's not as bad as his first impression will lead you to believe, though. Best stories: Vengence on Varos, The Two Doctors

Doc7: My favorite overall. Mysterious, manipulating, clever, yet compassionate. Awesome character and awesome companion (Ace).

You haven't provided any evidence, anecdotal or otherwise.

&gt;Why do you keep refusing to back your claims ? 

I have, even though I don't have to - I've given plenty of personal examples (elsewhere in this thread too), and elaborated that I'm far from alone in my experiences (as have other redditors), as well as illustrating why they're banned from pubs and clubs across the country (that's a good example actually - even though this is more than common, and can be seen in the series too, can you find evidence to *prove* this? And if not, does that mean that it doesn't actually exist?). If you don't think any of this is true, give some evidence of your own to the contrary.

&gt;So you are assuming that because i am asking question about your reasoning i am less informed on the subject than you are ?

Why would I assume otherwise? What evidence or examples have you presented? You would have (or should have) done so before now if you had any.

I was just suggesting that the majority of people using them are of the cheating spouse variety rather than the terrorist/armed robber kind.

That said, for tracking prison trucks/security vans it would be pretty trivial to have whatever system is in use at the base-station flag a vehicle missing the moment it fails to send a location update and raise an alarm accordingly along with a last-know position.  In fact I'd probably have the vehicle immobilize itself and lock all the doors if it lost GPS fix for more than a few minutes.

In terms of military applications, things like aircraft, ship and, missiles have inertial back ups (with the inevitable reduction in accuracy) and you'd kind of expect infantry to be able to read a map without pulling a Garmin out.  That's not to trivialise the issue in any manner, but I'd doubt the lack of a GPS fix would stop an army in it's tracks. 

Apart from time codes (which can be obtained from other sources such as NTP) I'm not sure what uses an airport has for GPS, and I'm reasonably sure that pilots have to know how to navigate using traditional methods of chart, compass and drift etc.

&gt;You gave one anecdotal example

And several others just in this thread. Which I suggested you look at. I'm not copy'n'pasting just because you can't be bothered to read.

&gt;and you avoided to answer my multiples questions about the value of anecodtal evidences,

No I didn't - I then listed several other sources to confirm that this wasn't *just* anecdotal at which point, you strangely got confused. I'm beginning to see a pattern here.

&gt;shouldnt you look at those and then provide an answer ?

Why? I don't have (or need) to establish that this *isn't* the norm, that burden is on you.

&gt;A discussion does not work this way

Correct. You have to actually do research for yourself rather than having it dumped on a plate for you. We're dealing with your ignorance on the subject, not mine.

&gt;the burden of the proof is on the one making claims

They're not claims, they're common knowledge. I've given you several sources, as well as google. What was that you were saying about 'avoiding'?

&gt;the burden of the proof is on the one making claims

And I've given you several places to start. And they're only claims to *you* - which in itself exposes your ignorance on the subject.

&gt;Wouldnt it be hard to bring examples on a claim that i never made ?

I didn't say you made a claim - but to summarise, you have no knowledge, experience or evidence to the contrary; I asked you to bring actual evidence to suggest that my statements weren't correct, because if you could be bothered to actually use google, you'd soon find out after weeding out the pro-traveller sites what the general state of play is. You can't be bothered.

It's a cup final I strongly suspect Kenny will go with a tried and trusted team and formation. With all respect to Carra, that means Agger/Skrtel in the centre of defence, Enrique LB, Johnson RB (Kelly is a possibility here, but I reckon he'll go with Glen's experience &amp; attacking potential).

Centre of midfield, Gerrard and Adam. Up front Carroll with Suarez who can drop a little deeper if needed.

On the wings it's a little trickier. I'd love to see Bellamy start, but Downing did have a decent match against Brighton. Henderson or Kuyt on the right, probably Kuyt for his experience, but both wings are a close call for me.

I suspect it'll be a fairly straightforward 4-4-2, as the team seem to be most comfortable with this. I don't think there'll be much experimentation.    

edit: I misspelled Gerrard (hangs head in shame). Also Reina in nets, of course.

No.

&gt;What make you think that you could possibly be in a position to educate me ? 

You've demonstrated your ignorance. And *anyone* could possibly be in a position to educate, unless you think you're beyond learning stuff.

&gt;So do you still think that anecdotal evidence may carry any kind of value ?

Did I say that?

&gt;Would you mind providing any link to those source that you have been claiming to use but unable to provide ?

Would you like to do some research of your own instead of using ignorance as a shield?

&gt;So you disagree with the fact that its impossible to back claim that dont exist?

Not what I said.

&gt;Arent you a bit confused by the rules of debate ?

You think this is a debate?

&gt;What kind of research did you do exactly ? 

You haven't been reading.

&gt;And why dont you provide the result of those researches ?

I don't have to. The 'result' is the current situation, and I've been talking about the behaviours that have gotten Gypsies to that point. Which you could find yourself by googling (or watching the show).

&gt;If they are more than ""claims"" how come is it so hard for you to back those up ?

It isn't.

&gt;Did i claim to the contrary at any point ?

Several times. You appear to be assuming that intentions absolve the need for clarity.

&gt;If not why would you ask me to contradict claim that you are not able to back ?

If the monkey had been seen by several hundred thousand people, your analogy would stand up. And in any case, I haven't asked you to do anything - I've just suggested an easy way to alleviate your ignorance.

&gt;Then if its so easy to find those source from google, why werent you able to provide them ? 

Why haven't you? I haven't been describing a theory - that's why it's called 'common knowledge' for anyone that's had to live near or deal with Gypsies. Why do you think the majority of my comments in this thread have gotten upvotes?

&gt;If you were to be in my position, wouldnt you guess that the individual claiming that they are many proof of his analysis very easy to find but that he is unable to provide them can not be serious ?

If I were that ignorant on a subject, I'd go and find some info for myself before arguing on a public board over something I knew nothing about (I learned this the hard way on [Compunet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compunet)). I certainly wouldn't then start demanding that others educate me on the spot, because that's not how it works. I could have given you many, many more examples, but you (for example) sezied on the first as some sort of indication that there was *only* one - and that's before we get to your ignoring the other examples and sources you could look to. At this point, usually before, people tend to stop caring - you, for instance, haven't even seen the show as evidenced by your questions, never mind debating how accurate it was.

&gt;By the way you used the term ""thousand armchair experts"" in this post 

That's correct.

&gt;as opposed to what you claimed later on. 

Not true. I didn't say 'Expert in Armchair' as you suggested.

&gt;So could you please explain what you mean by that ?

Armchair experts = people with no prior knowledge or experience that assume that if it isn't on the internet, it isn't true or doesn't exist. For example, considering the number of armchair experts over Iraq, it's suprising that we need any real military intelligence at all.

Three examples;

* Read Private Eye - then confirm their stories online. You usually won't be able to. Does that mean they're not true?

* The Sun, the most popular tabloid in the UK, famously bribed a stupid woman with the promise of £1 million if she tried carrying eght babies to term, despite all medical advice to following the normal course of saving one or two at the expense of the others. This went on daily for a few weeks, with front page X-Rays with 'DOING FINE' as the headline. Surprise surprise, she lost them all, making The Sun the first newspaper to kill babies in the name of selling newspapers. Now find evidence of this on The Sun's (or any) website. Does that mean this isn't true either?

* Take the statement - 'Socks cause car accidents, because almost everyone involved in accidents is wearing socks'. Can you find a study that proves this isn't so? 

* In Spain, Gypsies that arrive in a crowd playing guitars are expected to pay for their drinks by the round, rather than keeping a tab. The reason for this is that they all disappear at the end of the night, before paying the tab. This is common knowledge in Spain, at least along the South East coast. Can you find a study that proves this is so? And if not, does that mean it doesn't actually happen?

Let's be real here. Slavery is a dark, illegal, and lethal practice that has killed millions over the course of history and wiped out entire cultures and races of people. Slaves are humans used as property to be bought and sold to other humans, and deprived of the right to leave, to refuse to work, or to demand compensation (I lifted that right from the Wikipedia article). 

Slaves are picked up through kidnap and deception, forced to live in squalor and work as manual labourers and sex workers for the majority of their lives. They have no rights or means to get out of their situation. There are estimated [27 million](http://www.smfcdn.com/assets/pubs/un_chronicle.pdf) slaves in the world today, and I tell you now, they aren't working in fucking Tesco.

These workfare employees have homes, rights, food and clothes. Stacking shelves and carrying books around for a few hours a day, with breaks, with a payment at the end of the week is not a lifetime of forced manual labour under pain of severe punishment.

true,0000again,null,null,"Donna at first was one of my least favorite companions the Doctor had. She was impulsive, couldn't understand common sense concepts because she felt like she had to do what was ""right"", and often came off like she felt she had a sense of entitlement because she thought she had something to say, regardless of how relevant it really was to the situation. The flip-flopping with wanting to be with the Doctor or going home got old after a while, although it was understandable why she wanted to leave and come back.

It's all true, but she does it for different reasons than what I first thought. 

The most important part: I think she didn't just want a different life than the one she was living, and it'd definitely be entirely different with the Doctor; I think she truly wanted a BETTER life for herself. She didn't want to just disregard her family and her home situation. She wanted it to improve, and I think just leaving her home with the Doctor isn't doing anything other than leaving the situation entirely.

She's flip-floppy with wanting to leave the Doctor and then going back (almost symbolic foreshadowing of her eventual conflict with having her memory erased from having trouble deciding what kind of life she wants or needs to live), but it's because she's probably the most realistic when it comes to pure reaction. I mean, I'd love to go with the Doctor, but that's some serious shit you have to go through to do it. She shows the most realistic reactions because they're unavoidable: sadness, anger, excitement, etc. (I just don't like the fact she reasons her thought processes WITH her emotions instead of realizing there's more going on than what she ""feels""). 

She comes off as being stubborn or with a sense of entitlement because she knows, or at least wants, the capability to DO something about the situation. She knows it's important and that the fact she's even there to experience those events is not something most people will come across.

THEN, when I'm starting to reanalyze my original observations, she falls in love with a guy who she'll never see again, she's thrown into a completely different life where she has ""children"" that she loved but never actually had, her father was tied into the death of the tenth Doctor, and to fucking top it all off she forgets it all. Everything she experienced. It is literally, in my opinion, one of the most horrible things that's ever happened on the show. It makes me teary eyed to think of losing such a huge part of yourself, especially when she was still in conflict with trying to figure out what she wanted in relation to not just everything that was erased from her memory, but how her home life tied into all of it.

But again, that result is almost the most realistic of all the companions. She doesn't go on to do ""great"" things like Rose or Martha. She goes back to her own life and IMPROVES it, despite the Doctor not being around. She inadvertently made herself happy and improved her life, almost ""on her own"", because she doesn't remember anything about the Doctor.

That's not the problem, the problem is getting them interested in the first place.  The current ICT curriculum is more like 'How to use Microsoft *WhatEver^tm* than actually teaching them about what a computer is, how it works and most importantly how to do more than browse Facebook and write a CV.  
Hell, even if the only thing schools use Pi's for is word processing, they could effectively give each child their own PC to carry around with them in their bags.  

&gt;Also, I can't see how programming will make the computer need a re-install. Not if they are just using an IDE to compile and run programs.

That's not what I meant to imply, for most parents a PC is the magic box between the keyboard and screen.  A PC is an expensive investment, especially for parents at the bottom of the wage ladder.  And having to pay someone to fix it is at least a PITA and at worst unaffordable.  The Pi does away with that, Even including the price of a monitor, keyboard and mouse its less than £200.  If they kids already have a TV with HDMI then it's less than £50.  That's hugely attractive.

true,The_Evil_Within,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"I watched the first 3 William Hartnell stories, which was surprisingly easy to do despite the slow pace and poor f/x.  After that, though, the novelty of watching the original Doctor Who wore off and I had a lot of trouble getting through the following episodes.

I then watched all the Dalek and regeneration episodes (subject to availability, I can't take the reconstructions...) for 1-7, then 8's awful American TV movie.

Finally, I went back to the beginning again, and tried to watch every surviving episode I hadn't already seen, in order.  Honestly, I'm pretty sure I more or less skipped 2's run.  3 I could start to lay off the FF button towards the last half of his final season.  4 (MY Doctor) got the lightest FF treatment yet, but still got some.  I also discovered Shada (yay! NEW classic Who, effectively!), which I think is better in reconstruction than the original would have been.  I can't imagine the parts Tom Baker narrated could have been anything but boring.

I then took a break from Doctors and watch the Sarah Jane Adventures (seasons 1-3 so far) to get my kid back into Who.  It worked!

I'm currently working my way through 5, and I was surprised to find out I'd seen his first season and just mentally swapped Tom Baker into his place in my memory.  The second season, though, looks entirely new to me.  Adric's gone (yay!), Nyssia's a butterface (boo!), and Tegan's whining is currently on layover at Heathrow (yay!) but I understand she returns here and there (boo!).

I am NOT looking forward to 6 - the 80s clown, nor 7, who was suffering from BBC executive hatred.  From what I know of the companions for 6 &amp; 7, I'm not really anticipating enjoying much of the show, but I do hope to be surprised.

true,[deleted],null,null,"As much as I agree with you that Ten's character was overall a selfless hero, I think what was brilliant about the end of his arc was the development he made toward the very end. In the Christmas episode with the Sigorax (sp?), he says something along the lines of ""I don't know who I am yet."" I don't think he really decides that throughout his entire run. In ""The Waters of Mars,"" he briefly decides that since he's the last time lord, he has the final say on what were formerly heavily-regulated temporal laws. When he tries to change the past, the woman he saves kills herself to restore the future that he had previously told her about.

That's the biggest thing. Ten realizes at the end of WoM that he's gone too far, made a mistake to take so much executive power into his own hands. At this point I think he's really realizing he hasn't quite ""found himself"" yet. Every regeneration gives him a chance to experiment with personality and interests and passions, and other than being the handsome, clever one, he never really developed ""who he is,"" or at least never decided he did. 

That's why, at the beginning of EoT, he's been on vacation for so long before going to the Ood Sphere. He's procrastinating, putting off death to try to find himself. And at the end of it all, when he's about to die, he still hasn't quite decided who he is. 

Ten's character is an enigma. He's got a joix de vivre that Nine didn't, and he's certainly more accomplished, but this enjoyment of life is what leads him to want to stay who he is.

Most churches are charities. Would you try and restrict people on benefits (which covers a ridiculous amount of people, particularly if you include the money automatically given to people with kids!) giving to other charities?

While I understand your point it is, unfortunately, not that simple. We could come at it from a different direction:

Why should a vegan tax payer subsidise someone who gets benefits for food and buys meat or animal products with it?     
Why should someone who thinks smoking is disgusting subsidise someone who uses some of their benefits to buy cigarettes?      
Why should a religious person with particular convictions with regards to 'what is moral' when it comes to sex &amp; relationships subsidise someone who gets benefits but also donates to Stonewall?     

I do understand where you're coming from as I don't much like it either (what can I say, I ain't a great fan of religion), but we (the majority/the state) can't pick and choose what someone buys with their benefits - though of course sometimes there are restrictions to ensure people *do* buy food, for example (in certain situations that's sensible). 

'Unfortunately' it's none of our business what this family decide to spend their money (as if they are receiving it legitimately, be it wage or benefit) so long as it's legal as it is *their* money, and if we decide to restrict particular activities then we have no defence against restricting others, apart from the will of the majority. And that ain't a good thing for minorities, of which I guarantee you are probably one in some small way.

And now someone will point out a restriction on spending benefits that I wasn't aware of - feel free! It'll be interesting.

If someone with time on their hands cares to message the mods of those other subs and ask if they'd be willing to curate a non-meme, non-TARDIS-cake DW forum, I think we'd all be better for it.  Those of us who like all the funny jokes and pics of absolutely *everything* related to *Doctor Who* can always come to /r/doctorwho.  For those who'd like to have a place where discussion threads, news, and links to original (ie, submitter-created) art and miscellany aren't drowned out by Ten-crying-in-the-rain GIFs, /r/drwho or /r/Whovians might be a nice occasional refuge.  
  
NOTE: I am in no way encouraging anyone to leave /r/doctorwho.  On the contrary, I love how vibrant and active this place is, and I'll continue to visit as most of us will.  Rather, I'm pointing out that there is a definite niche to fill, and /r/doctorwho just can't fill it any more because it has grown far too large.

A computer like this can, and in my opinion *should*, become an integral part of a 21st century schoolkid's pencil case as much as a pencil and eraser are. The schools should pay for the first RPi, so that no kid no matter what their parents' financial circumstances are gets left out. The cat is out of the bag. Computers and programming are here to stay. For so long as the curriculum neglects these subjects, it will be less relevant to modern lives and modern needs and *the future*. The Micro put a computer in every school. The RPi can put a computer in the palm of every child's hand. I'd like to see student-initiated programming projects developing what they want to create, rather than proscriptive step-by-step copy-from-the-blackboard tasks. I'd like to see more emphasis on end results, which I believe speak for themselves, than marking criteria and qualification boxchecking.

&gt;*In contrast, in some labor-intensive sectors that rely heavily on human interaction or activities, such as nursing, education, or the performing arts there is little or no growth in productivity over time.*

So, anyway, the idea would be that we're not interested in *ownership* per se - I used to have a Labour Party membership card that apparently committed me to working for the public ownership of the means of 'production, distribution and exchange'; it was nonsense then and nonsense now.

*Ownership*, no. In my lifetime the quality and variety of food  - an absolutely basic necessity  - available to me has improved almost immeasurably. It's been provided through private competition between a few large chains and many smaller suppliers responding to market signals. I don't care who owns the production, distribution, marketing and merchandising of food. I care about its range, price and quality and that *is* provided by private suppliers better than, say, a *state-owned supermarket chain* ever would or could.

Education isn't food; and education is what economists would call a *mixed good*, which gives a role for the state at least in part-funding. But *delivery* of educational services needn't be solely or wholly in the hands of the State to ensure quality. That would be a preposterous suggestion in so many other areas we'd laugh at the idea. State-owned furniture shops? State-owned restaurants? State-owned pop music groups? State-owned clothes shops?

&gt;In my lifetime the quality and variety of food - an absolutely basic necessity - available to me has improved almost immeasurably. It's been provided through private competition between a few large chains and many smaller suppliers responding to market signals.

Without evidence, you attribute to capitalism the benefits derived from cheap abundant energy and rapidly evolving technology.  You also ignore the impoverishment, land theft, virtual enslavement, brutalisation and murder that large tracts of the developing and historical world were forced to endure in order to provide you with your comfortable privileged lifestyle.

We could talk more about the massive subsidies agriculture and big business food growers, suppliers and retailers receive, the distortions  they leverage government to impose on the so-called ""free market"", the lack of any genuine competition, and the harm these features have caused to small business people and workers at home and abroad, but I suspect that your mind is now closed to all this.

A 2:2 is one of the classifications you can get for your degree.  Basically, it's your degree's overall 'grade'.  As far as I know this is grading system used for all university courses studied in the UK.

There are four grades; first class honours (1st) which is the highest, second class honours in both upper divisions (2:1 - this is what the university tends to say students should aim for) and lower divisions (the aforementioned 2:2) and third class degrees (3rd).

true,kyzf42,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"&gt;Well, if people aren't upvoting the discussion, that probably means they aren't interested.   

Obviously that's part of it.  Another part is that some of us who like the discussion are not the type to obsessively check the subreddit for new posts, so when one does appear, it's not visible long enough to attract many of those who visit less often.  
  
There's a ton of rehashing of old discussions too, but both of those stem from not enough people getting to even *see* the original discussion in the first place.  Look at the percentages in that Community Content poll I linked to above.  There is obviously a sizeable minority who would like to see more exposure for discussion threads.  I'm just throwing out possible remedies for how to achieve that.  
  
&gt;And yes, trying to take discussion and news to a different subreddit is fracturing this subreddit.  
  
I strongly disagree.  There's no reason to think that the existence of a different subreddit would in any way harm this one.  As has been said elsewhere, discussion threads have a very hard time breathing in here because it's so crowded with the imgur links -- which themselves are fine, but since they require relatively little thought or effort to submit, there will always naturally be many more of them.

But anyway, I think you've misunderstood the HMRC thing - you only pay VAT if you're charging it to the customer. However you don't have to break it down for them (unless it's requested as I started above), so I think that might be what that is referring to. But when you sell zero-rated items, for example, you do not pay any VAT to HMRC at all.

Eg. if I said ""okay I'll sell you this watch for £10"" and you accept, give me £10, I technically didn't tell you I was charging any VAT there did I - however if I'm VAT registered then I have to pay £1.66 of that to HMRC. In reality I did actually charge VAT on it for that reason, however it just wasn't stated at the point if sale. If you requested a VAT receipt from me then i would have to provide it to you as I'm VAT registered and paying VAT, and you have a right to claim that back if you are also VAT registered.

[spoilers for Torchwood and seasons 3 and 4 of doctor who](/s ""It's a different Jack than we have now, who runs around and dies constantly, and has a totally different outlook on life because of it."")

I think my favorite moment so far is the end of season one, with Bad Wolf and the Time Vortex. I love that Rose became all powerful and spread the words Bad Wolf through out time and space just to tell herself that she could do it, and that she could save the Doctor and the world and Jack and everyone. I love that she can convince her mother and Mickey to help her, on doing something that could very well, and almost did, kill her. I love that she appears and sees everything for what it is, the universe and time, and life. She saves the day, and is still vulnerable. Plus there's the kiss.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans along. We've had approximately 780 episodes but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in anywhere.

The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a person will like.

Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 then relaunched in 2005. By no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv). You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

And even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor. The ninth only has one series with some questionable writing, but he's a fantastic Doctor as well, and shines when given the chance. No matter what you do, watch all six series. And if you like them, there's always classic who... :D",0,1329970164,null,0,false,0,c3u1yz3,t3_q1oq6,t1_c3u1yz3,t3_q1oq6,null,1428403921,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Apparently he first invented time travel and regeneration, then regenerated a bunch of times, then got jealous of the Doctor's escapades on Earth, so he went back to Earth around the same era as the Doctor, spent a few years and a few regenerations as Bond in ""deep cover"" and saving the world whenever the Doctor was too busy to do it himself.  At some point they somewhat switched roles and the Doctor was Lord President.  Rassilon was jealous of this, so he went back to Earth for a while to steal the spotlight for a while.  Around when the Doctor headed back to Earth, Rassilon went back in time to before the Time War, where he got trapped by the Doctor in a time loop and couldn't regenerate.  Until the Tenth Doctor kicked his ass again after inadvertently helping the Master bring Gallifrey into solar orbit.   

After that, he went to hide in Earth's recent past, where he regenerated into his eighth and ninth (or later?) incarnations while staying out of the Doctor's sight.  But knowing that without the Earth and the Doctor his own timeline would be disrupted, he kept on saving the world, even after having his balls beaten by a human megalomaniac.  

The only strange thing about it all is why the hell he needed a defibrillator.  Is it possible that he was using a fob watch device? ",0,1329974334,null,0,false,0,c3u2r3t,t3_q1qpw,t1_c3u2r3t,t1_c3u2gnr,null,1428404293,29,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,29

FYI, when you're done if you want to go through the older episodes on netflix I found this page helpful: [Doctor Who DVDs, chronologically on netflix](http://netflixcommunity.ning.com/group/thetimelords/forum/topic/show?id=1993323:Topic:19856) 

Unfortunately Netflix doesn't group the older seasons/series like it does with the new series. So trying to wade through the pages to find the older eps, then put them in order is an ordeal. That link should help. Though very few of the older eps are available as streaming, they're nearly all as DVDs.

Fortunately ""The Pirate Planet"" arc with the 4th Doctor (Tom Baker) is available as streaming, and that's listed as a fan favorite, so at least we get that. ;)

Nine:* Do you wanna come with me? 'Cause if you do, then I should warn you - you're gonna see all sorts of things. Ghosts from the past. Aliens from the future. The day the Earth died in a ball of flame. It won't be quiet, it won't be safe, and it won't be calm. But I'll tell you what it will be: The trip of a lifetime!*

I started with Nine, and this is pretty much how they hook you. It sounds like the most amazing adventure ever. It is the beginning. 

Nine: * 1941. Right now, not very far from here, the German war machine is rolling up the map of Europe. Country after country, falling like dominoes. Nothing can stop it, nothing. Until one tiny, damp little island says ""No. No, not here."" A mouse in front of a lion. You're amazing, the lot of you. I don't know what you did to Hitler, but you frighten the hell out of me, go on, do what you've got to do, save the world.*

This quote goes really well with when 10 is talking about Humans in The Impossible Planet, and how they go out and land on this impossible planet just because they can and because they want to know why. I really like the optimism in those two points. 

Ten: *I've seen fake gods and bad gods and demigods and would-be gods; out of all that, out of that whole pantheon, if I believe in one thing... just one thing... I believe in her.* 

This is a great line, especially all that happened after Bad Wolf. Rose is powerful. and she's just human. I like that.

The Labour Theory of Value is discredited. Nevertheless, you carry on banging away there.

Well, there's plenty of evidence. During the entire history of the Soviet Union, total factor productivity wasn't increased _at all_. All growth in GDP came from increased resource consumption. During the same period, 80% of GDP increase in the West came from tfp improvement, only 20% from increased resource consumption.

GP fundholding and practice commissioning have previously been tried, without startling success, by successive Tory and Labour administrations. The new reform will abolish PCTs and SHAs, GPs will take control of 80% of the NHS budget, hospitals will have more freedom from centralised control.

Is it the  fact of  80% of the budget being controlled by GPs that makes you concerned about 'outsourcing to the private sector' - GPs in the NHS being *private health providers* (they're not state employees)?

When people say that, I usually just write them off as economically illiterate (or Austrians, which amounts to much the same thing).  But I'll cut you a break and ask if you care to state _which_ theory of value you believe has been ""discredited"" and why.

&gt;During the entire history of the Soviet Union, total factor productivity wasn't increased at all.

Since the former Soviet Union was a State capitalist economic system not a socialist one, I'm not sure what this demonstrates.  Add to that that Total Factor Productivity is effectively a modelling artifact, essentially unmeasurable mathematicalised handwaving, as well as requiring one to buy into the whole neo-classical shebang.  There's plenty of classical criticism ([e.g. the Cambridge controversy](http://cas.umkc.edu/econ/economics/faculty/henry/courses/Econ506/Readings/Cohen.Harcourt.CambridgeConroversy.pdf)) and Marxists basically dismiss it as the usual attempt to credit capital with value added by labour.  The idea of value being added by management makes most of us workers want to laugh - or vomit, and there's good empirical data that worker-self-management wins in terms of productivity.

There are plenty of mainstream economists who reject it also: e.g. “Alas, the usefulness of [total-factor] productivity statistics is questionable. The quality of different inputs can change significantly over time. There can also be significant differences in the mix of inputs. Furthermore, firms and countries may use different definitions of their inputs, especially capital.” —Matthew Bishop, Essential Economics (2009).

&gt;As a matter of fact, the history of humans has been one of impoverishment and brutality. It's only capitalism that has brought about a significant change in this.

You can take off those rose-tinted spectacles and take a look around you anytime you like.  I readily concede that peaceful coexistence has been in short supply throughout most of human history and that the quantities of democide today spring considerably from the industrialisation and technologisation of slaughter (as well as from the sheer numbers of people on the planet).  But, still, the systematic exploitation of the mass of people is largely a feature unique to capitalism and its feudalist and mercantalist parents.

&gt;I trust you'll be voting for policies &amp; parties determined to remove them?

Workers have an immediate economic ROI in the short term, but enquiry, i suggest, has longer term benefits such as innovation.

The interesting point in the science vs. arts &amp; humanities debate is that in respect of the destination of leavers of higher education those that study business and administration or marketing and communications are more likely to get high paying management positions than those that study STEM subjects.

The rand argument, going forwards, is that we should get rid of ""the safety net"" and liberalise *everything* allowing society to benefit because the wealth creators are strong individualistic people that will naturally strive towards success.

The problem is that banks didn't want to be bailed out and part nationalised.

Your mate is paying the same now but what if the interest rate rises 1%? 
If you have a mortgage of £150,000 over 25 years and the interest rate rises 1% the monthly payment goes up £83 a month for repayment and £125 a month for interest only. The BoE base rate is at a historic low and as soon as the BoE is happy recovery is well on the way they'll start ramping up the base rate. If it rises to 3%, putting a tracker mortgage up by 2.5%, that £150k mortgage will cost an extra £214 a month for repayment and £312.50 a month for interest only.

That's exactly why it's called *insurance*. If you crash your car the insurance company doesn't say ""sorry davmaggs, you only paid £1000 into the system so that's all were going to pay out."" You cannot run a support system for people based on how much they individually paid into the system. You might as well just tell people to get a savings account and hope never to hit hard times or illness. 

As to people not having paid in at all, I don't have figures to hand, but I assume it will be much less than the people paying in otherwise there would be much more noise made by politicians about not being able to afford the system as all, rather than the current cries of it being too expensive. But this ignores the two primary reasons for having a benefits system in the first place. 

One is that it's just plain humanity to help your fellow man in need, we have all heard the phrase ""there but for the grace of god go I"" and it's not until you have have an upset in your life that many people realise this. People with well paid jobs are just one accident away from leaving their family without a main breadwinner, or a life of severe disability requiring 24 hour care. Can you really look at your financial state and say with all honesty that you, or your family, would be fine if you were unable to work.

The second fact to consider is the cost to society of having no support system. With no support people have three choices, Work, beg or crime. For those unable to or who cannot find work crime becomes the main option. In 2008/09 it cost an average of £39,600 to keep a prisoner in prison for a year. The UK has the second highest incarceration rate in Western Europe [Source](http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/key-issues-for-the-new-parliament/security-and-liberty/the-prison-population/).

There are medications, newer ones, that can  reverse the effects of RA. You can't get them on the NHS straight away because they're deemed too expensive - the methotrexate must fail first. When I asked my consultant about this he said 'write to your MP'.

true,Blaidd_Dwrg,eng-lancashire,Preston,"This is quite a surreal reversal. The *Tories* are now calling the working (or not as the case may be) class snobs for getting uppity about being exploited? First IDS with his ""job snobs"" and now this. 

Let's get one thing straight. Businesses are concerned with making money. It's what they do. This is not a bad thing nor a good thing; morality does not come into it. It's just the nature of the beast. Denying that nature is dangerous.

As a species we have learned to control powerful forces for our collective and individual benefit. Fire is an obvious example. Fire can be tremendously destructive if left to rage unchecked, but when properly controlled it provides warmth, cooks our food, transports us around the planet - etc. You don't have to be anti-fire to understand the dangers of fire. Quite the opposite; anyone who makes use of fire needs to know the dangers so they can protect themselves.

The economy has its forces too; profit and loss, supply and demand - all embodied in private enterprise. When properly controlled, business makes society better. It provides the stuff we need, the jobs we need to pay for the stuff we need, it even (however grudgingly) passes on a portion of the wealth it generates to the state which can then provide services that private enterprise cannot, or should not, be responsible for, such as education and healthcare.

Just like you don't need to be anti-fire to be against having your home burned down or anti-water to be against floods, neither do you need to be anti-business to be against allowing private enterprise to rage unchecked.

Cameron and his cronies are trying to frame the debate by fallaciously equating being against one aspect of a thing with being against the thing itself. Several members of his party have made similar arguments recently, saying that anyone who is against the way the work scheme is currently implemented must be against the state helping the long term unemployed break out of the no experience/no job cycle. Utter rubbish, of course we're not, we just want it done without businesses being given free licence to exploit vulnerable people. Fair pay for a fair day's work is not a novel concept.

I actually agree with him on one point though. Business is a powerful force for social progress. Look at the difference between how the private sector has reacted to this kerfuffle and the government's response. All the major firms have scrambled to cover their arses by either pulling out of the scheme entirely, or in one notable case promising to pay its workers (I never thought I'd be living in a Great Britain where actually paying your staff is worthy of praise). 

The government on the other hand has reacted by insulting us for not wanting to work for free. RBS' chief exec certainly won't work for free but - no wait, if we don't like that we're being anti-business again. I really must try harder to keep my snobbery in check.

But it's really no surprise that businesses listen while the government turns its back. Government has a monopoly on the business of, well, government. We can't simply take our business elsewhere if we don't like them. Sure we have the occasional election but that's just reshuffles the management. They don't have a bottom line to think about, unlike business which, despite being basically amoral, knows that public disapproval means customers walking away and taking their money with them.",0,1330002374,null,0,false,0,c3u5gwj,t3_q292o,t1_c3u5gwj,t3_q292o,null,1428405570,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

This old canard huh?  Western governments, NGOs, transnational corporations and international organisations have to conspire with corrupt developing world regimes (often provoking conflict and installing compliant regimes) to ensure working people's lives are sufficiently miserable to make sweatshops an attractive option by comparison.  How exactly they do this varies from time to time and place to place, but it often involves land reform (most developing world peasants have been robbed of their land at this stage of history, many in relatively recent times - and it is ongoing - see for example Mexico and parts of Africa, often in the name of ""efficient use of resources"" or the war on drugs).  Sometimes the World Bank and IMF come in and institute ""free market"" reforms, tying countries into astonishingly abusive trade relationships with the US/EU (watch the film Life and Debt about Jamaica for example), often bribing administrations to take countries into crippling debt in the process.

How can we know?  How can we make a fair comparison?  You're assuming there was only one route to a modern society.

&gt;It is impossible to form a sound conclusion as to the value to mankind of this institution which the Arkwrights, the Watts, and the Stephensons had brought into being if we confine ourselves to a comparison of the efficiency of the factory system of production with the efficiency of the processes of production which prevailed before the factory appeared.
A very different comparison must be made.

&gt;We must suppose that the inventive and scientific discoveries of the past two centuries had not been used to destroy the methods of production which prevailed before the factory. We must suppose that an amount of thought and ingenuity precisely equal to that used in developing the factory had been devoted to the development of domestic, custom, and guild production. We must suppose that the primitive domestic spinning wheel had been gradually developed into more and more efficient domestic machines; that primitive looms, churns, cheese presses, candle molds, and primitive productive apparatus of all kinds had been perfected step by step without sacrifice of the characteristic ""domesticity"" which they possessed. In short, we must suppose that science and invention had devoted itself to making domestic and handicraft production efficient and economical, instead of devoting itself almost exclusively to the development of factory machines and factory production.

&gt;The factory-dominated civilization of today would never have developed. Factories would not have invaded those fields of manufacture where other methods of production could be utilized. Only the essential factory would have been developed. Instead of great cities, lined with factories and tenements, we should have innumerable small towns filled with the homes and workshops of neighborhood craftsmen. Cities would be political, commercial, educational, and entertainment centers.... Efficient domestic implements and machines developed by centuries of scientific improvement would have eliminated drudgery from the home and the farm.

Anyway, back to the stats.

Just because some criminals are rich, and most of the working class does not turn to crime, does not negate the link.

&gt;Further, the poverty narrative for the riots completely fails to take into account that many of those convicted were middle class, hardly on the bread line, and the riots did not start in any of the poorest areas in the country (none of which are in London).

There is, obviously, more to it than material poverty, although for the most part the rioters were not middle class. Middle class rioters were the exceptions that prove the rule.

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","Remember to account for fitting when budgeting - it's not generally included, and as well as the labour charge, you need grippers, edge plates etc.

Measure the room before you go, and have measurements for the entire circumference. This is doubly important if the room is not square; your measurements should allow you to draw a scale diagram of the floor you want carpeted.

The supplier should be able to tell you if a carpet will fit, and tell you what the smallest remnant you can buy is. Some remnants are huge (I've seen 5m by 8m remnants in my local carpet store), others are tiny.

If in doubt, spend less on the carpet and more on the underlay. Carpets tend to cost more if they look fancier. Underlay tends to cost more if it does a better job. £5/m² carpet with £10/m² underlay will tend to feel better underfoot and last longer than £10/m² carpet with £5/m² underlay. Also, be aware that it's the underlay that provides most of the heat insulation - if you want the room to feel warm, good underlay helps.

Finally, remember to shop around on total price - the difference between £25/m² (all-in) and £20/m² carpet, underlay and fitting, £20 in accessories doesn't sound like a lot - but if your room is 4m by 3m, it's actually significant.",0,1330014871,null,0,false,0,c3u792w,t3_q2g72,t1_c3u792w,t3_q2g72,null,1428406410,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Its certainly the case that ethnic minorities were over-represented in the riots, but this is partially because a) they are still over-represented in poverty stats and b) there are definite racial overtones to the anger with the police. 

EDIT: The gang and criminal cultures, white and black, in Liverpool are a result of high rates of unemployment and poverty in this city for at least the last century.

But having taken a look at your posts in this thread, I think we're simply approaching things using two different definitions of capitalist.  When I talk about capitalism, I talk of the free market, of people having the option of taking their own risks for their own rewards; it's the epitome of somebody being entitled to the fruits of their own labour.  I contrast it with collectively- or centrally-run systems, where the underlying philosophy is one of socialist principles of putting absolutely everything you can into the collective pot and taking out only the bare minimum that you need.  I'm trying to approach it from a clinical, economic standpoint.  
  
When you say capitalism, it seems that you're referencing disproportionately wealthy, powerful people conspiring with government to manipulate events so as to turn workers into a perpetual underclass.

Tripling the rate of imprisonment is a drastic increase. It appeals to politicians who want to be seen as tough on crime and it may take some potentially dangerous people off the streets for a year. However it will also have long term effects on a lot of young people who were acting out of frustration, anger or stupidity at the time but who did not have a criminal history (such as Mr Robinson).

Exponential growth means that future work is worth more than today's work, which in turn means that the more work units you have to invest in the future the more relative wealth you gain on average. On the other hand, those without the means to invest will always end up doing more than their fair share as their work units are devalued over time. 

Vast stores of wealth are a side-effect of the capitalist system, competition for the future drives the exponential growth. As work generally consists of expending energy the laws of physics are a real barrier, this cycle can only continue until we have pissed away every drop of energy from the planet.

At the moment it seems to be working quite well, we aren't starving to death yet and the planet hasn't been completely raped so who cares? It's reckless and unsustainable though and I can't call it a moral system until we have a stable population, 0% growth and inflation, and maybe even regular [Jubilees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubilee_\(Christianity\)) to keep things balanced.

Bale gets to the byline and sends in a cross, but Schzhezhchzehzny punches it well clear. 

The ball falls beautifully for Ledley who is just arriving centrally about 25 yards from goal. He strikes it on the half volley with the outside of his right boot and it arrows into the right corner, slamming in violently off the crossbar.  

The skipper proceeds to outrun Lennon and Bale to our fans, does 3 cartwheels and a backflip before perfectly executing the dance from ""Thriller"".

That keeps discipline and skills up much better than getting pissed off because you're FORCED to work for NOTHING. This, when everyone around you is a wage earner. You're telling me that would help someone's morale, at all? That's completely absurd!

I have already stated that I agree something needs to be done. However, making people work and basically giving money to private companies is not any kind of a solution. There's a DWP document from 2008 that says similar projects in other countries have not worked at all, in any way. That hasn't changed, this still doesn't work!

Focus on other solutions. So, cap the time you can claim benefits, that's incentive enough to apply for any job. Obviously, some flexibility is necessary to help those that fall 'between the cracks' for whatever reason. Provide more training for everyone, make that affordable, it currently is extremely tough for anyone not aged 18-24 to get re-trained. Invest in infrastructure, the most successful known way of growing an area. It actively creates jobs and then people invest in the area, creating longevity of jobs.

I'm highlighting that the skills people can earn could be garnered in other areas and better ways than forcing them to work for private companies, almost as an extended job interview/slave relationship. I understand the point you make about people wanting to give something back. They can, it's volunteer work in their community. Push that aggressively, it will also create a better sense of how community functions and the effects of different people, policies and actions.

OK, sorry, I was referring to what you said in your last post:  ""What you have now in America is no longer capitalism.""

&gt;everyone likes the story of working hard and being sucessful

Of course, that's why it's such a powerful component of the myth of capitalism.

&gt;And again, how is that parasitic?

It isn't (necessarily).  Only capitalism (i.e. rentier activity) is parasitic.

&gt;Some people are simply handed jobs, property and money yes, but not thats an economic problem

Not sure I understand this sentence.  If you mean it _isn't_ an economic problem, I'd counter that it isn't _necessarily_, but it definitely can be because it contributes to concentration and over-accumulation which are fundamental problems/contradictions which plague capitalism (and were in substantial part responsible for the 2008 economic crisis).

&gt;Most people work their way into those positions.

This is just plain wrong.  There have been studies done looking at US large cap CEOs* (and the US is universally viewed as far more meritocratic than the UK, we have a fairly poor record in comparison), the majority come from inherited wealth.  But even that's not the point - when a person claims to be rich through hard work, you must always ask yourself, whose?  Did they invent their product themselves?  Did they build their factory with their own two hands and work the machines which made it?  Did they invent and build those machines? Did they drive the trucks which distributed it on roads which they built? etc. etc.  At every step along the way there were workers being robbed of part of the value of their labour, paying the tribute to capital.


\* Edit:  And I should add that these guys are really still notionally servants of capital rather than capitalists by virtue of their position (albeit when you're that wealthy a servant of capital, there's a lot of cross-over in terms of ownership of capital/means of production, and many would argue the boards largely run corporations for their own benefit, and for a handful of extremely large and powerful shareholders - certainly not for the guys with a couple of hundred shares...).",0,1330031349,null,0,true,0,c3uapas,t3_q292o,t1_c3uapas,t1_c3u9zq1,null,1428408104,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Sadly I find that's a rare trait in people, so I enjoy seeing her character. There's a scene in season 2 (Impossible Planet) where Rose encounters the Ood and asks a crew member:

*""You've got slaves?""* 

And the woman replies dismissively and mockingly:

*""She's like one of that lot. Friends of the Ood.""* 

And Rose immediately fires back, completely unintimidated:

*""Maybe I am, yeah. Since when do humans need slaves?""* 

Her fierceness in situations like that always wins me over. She's not the cool, collected action hero that Martha is, but Rose has a lot of emotional strength and a unique joie de vivre for travel (which I think is what endears her to The Doctor). 

From poking around online I think many fans forget Rose is only 19 years old. And a sheltered 19 at that. I doubt most people would behave as admirably as she does at that age.

&gt;""Highland Park means quite a lot to mean because in my work as PPS [Parliamentary Private Secretary] to Norman Lamont when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer....
&gt;
&gt;""It means a lot to me because he always drank Highland Park on Budget Day. And every time, all the three or four budgets I helped him with, he always had to have Highland Park on the table of the House of Commons.
&gt;
&gt;""One Budget Day he said about 12 o'clock, when we were sitting in Number Eleven getting ready for the budget: 'I think I'm going to have to have a drink of whisky early today. Go and get the Highland Park.'
&gt;
&gt;""So I went down Downing Street, across Parliament Square, got the Highland Park. Then I thought I can't go into Number Eleven in front of all those cameras with a bottle of whisky, so I I'll put it in a plastic bag.
&gt;
&gt;""So I put it in a plastic bag, walked into Number 11, with the plastic bag. We had a nice lunch with whisky - it's nice to see that the tradition of having whisky at lunch is continued here today. We had a few glasses to make the budget go well.
&gt;
&gt;""Then we went downstairs, the massed ranks of the press outside, all the cameras ready to record Budget Day, Norman and his wife, and me the PPS standing behind them.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;""And he said: 'Have you got the whisky?' I said I'd have to go back upstairs to get the whisky. But I said: 'I can't take it out in a plastic bag again, all those cameras, [and people asking] what is the PPS doing carrying a plastic bag?'
&gt;
&gt;""So he said: 'Wait a minute.' He opened the budget box and said: 'Why don't we stick it in the budget box?' So we're about to go out of the door and I say I'd try to get it in the budget box, and then I said: 'I can't get it in the budget box because the budget takes up too much room.'
&gt;
&gt;""So he said: 'Take the budget out of the budget box' - this is true, this is absolutely true - so we took the budget out of the budget box, and put the bottle of Highland Park into the budget box. We just managed to get the box closed and locked, and I carried the budget under my arm.
&gt;
&gt;""And we went out in front of the cameras, and Norman held up the budget box, and I'm standing behind him thinking if that isn't locked properly this could be the most embarrassing occasion in the history of politics. And he's holding up a box containing a bottle of whisky, and everybody looking at the PPS behind, carrying this anonymous folder, and that's the budget. And that's how we got the budget and the Highland Park to parliament on time.""",0,1330034192,null,0,false,0,c3ubbu7,t3_q2mt8,t1_c3ubbu7,t3_q2mt8,null,1428408398,32,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,32

Possibly under capitalism, probably not had history taken a different path.  In order to drive people into the factories, first they had to rob them of their land.

&gt;division of labour is a centuries old concept. Its the driving force of the economy

I don't know if you've ever read The Wealth of Nations, but oddly enough, the man who elaborated the concept of the division of labour and who all ""right-thinking"" capitalists lionised as a founding father was actually quite repelled by its consequences:

""(T)he understandings of the greater part of men are necessarily formed by their ordinary employments.  The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the effects too, perhaps, are always the same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his understanding, or to exercise his invention...for removing difficulties which never occur.  He naturally loses, therefore, the habit...and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become... His dexterity at his trade seems...to be acquired at the expense of his intellectual, social and martial virtues. But in every improved and civilised society this is the state into which the labouring poor, that is, the greater body of the people, must necessarily fall unless the government takes some pains to prevent it."" 

(feel free to go to the source, I've not left anything sneaky out of this passage - the dots mostly just crop olde worlde language).

&gt;What you are alluding to is Communism

Nope, I'm not a communist (ask anyone!)  The mistake you're making is assuming being anti-capitalist means you have to be communist.  I actually kind of like markets...just not rigged capitalist ones.  I use Marxian tools of analysis because Marx made a punishing critique of capitalism which has been shown to be accurate at pretty much every empirical test, indeed, you'd be very surprised perhaps to learn how swiftly mainstream economists turned to Marx again when the full implications of the 2008 crisis hit them.  It's funny watching a bunch of neo-classical and (god forbid) Austrian economists suddenly  boning up on their dusty and unread copy of Capital!

true,daveduckman,null,null,"Where to get tickets:

- The important thing is to make sure you get the ticket as opposed to save a few extra pounds (although you obviously don't want to pay something obscene)
- Check the Liverpoolfc.tv website under tickets for the available hospitality packages. The thomas cook things can generally be slightly better value than buying through online resellers because you also get accommodation, a program and a guaranteed, known ticket.
- The best reseller site i know of is http://www.livefootballtickets.com/english-premiership/liverpool-tickets.html Which has been reliable the couple of times i've used it. I quickly scanned through them and it seemed that the arsenal match tickets are around 200gbp while the fa cup is at about 80gbp and wigan game is 100gbp.

Choosing your ticket

- First off, you don't want to sit with the away fans, be very wary buying anfield road stand tickets from resellers unless they specifically state there with liverpool fans.
- Always assume a reseller ticket you get is going to be a bad seat in the described stand. Always make sure it's cat A because the restricted view seats can be really quite bad.

- You basically have two big options for your anfield matchday experience: pick a seat in the main/centenary stand and get a really good view of all ends of the ground. Or, get a ticket in the Kop End (sometimes there cheaper, sometimes there more expensive) which generally means that you get a really good view of your goal, and a slightly worse view of the far goal. The upside, is of course, you're sitting with the Kop, the most amazing atmosphere in any sporting event in the world. If I was only ever going to see one which in my visit, I would get tickets for the kop end, so you really get to soak in that magnificent atmosphere that Liverpool was born on. If you go to the arsenal game (the best one in march and the one i would go see in your position) the atmosphere across the ground will be really really good, but especially in the Kop End. Be prepared to spend most of the game standing. 
- Also note that the Everton match is postponed and will be rescheduled at some point. i have no idea when and it would be a massive gamble assuming it'll be in march/you will get tickets for it, but if it so happens that the match is on while you're there, GO TO IT. The only better game to go to is a northwest derby. Obviously you won't get tickets first hand for it, you'll need to use a reseller.

Your matchday experience

- Learn some of the core terrace chants for liverpool. I would suggest 'you'll never walk alone' 'fields of anfield road' 'oh campione' and the stevie gerrard ones. They will be sung repeatedly and nothing is quite as aweinspiring as the stadium singind YNWA or fields of anfield road.
- Plan how you are going *AND getting back* from the stadium. It will obviously depend on where you are staying, but a taxi from lime street station to the stadium or back is about 5quid. Especially for the trip back from anfield, you simply are not going to get a cab back to the city from near the stadium (unless you leave the ground early which obviously you won't want to do). If you are seeking to get a cab back from anfield, my advice is to start walking and then hail a cab as you start walking with masses back to the city. If you're staying somewhere in liverpool city centre, then start westward on Walton Breck Road, left onto Kirkdale or Great Homer St. Then walk along the side of the road going towards anfield and hail a cab from there (black cab with light on is available). There are also buses ferrying back to sandhills station, which is itself a 20min walk.
- Get to anfield the full 90-120 min before the match and start soaking up that atmosphere. Make sure you head into the ground at least 45-60min before the match so you can bask in the glory of anfield, see the match buildup and sing YNWA. 
- You can get programmes from the stalls out the front of Anfield stadium.

The rest of your time

- I'm guessing your asking for advice for the rest of your time in liverpool as opposed to UK in general. It really depends on how long your spending there and where your interests lie (history, art, food, drinking etc.)
- Do the anfield [museum and tour](http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/history/tour-and-museum) if you have a non matchday (not including the day before a game) in liverpool. Some of them are also run as anfield 'legend tours' where you are led by a kop hero (alan kennedy does heaps of them i think). I've never been on a legend tour so i can't comment on it. Tours don't normally go past the shankly gate and hillsborough memorial (round the back of anfield) so walk past there as well.

* -The rest is entirely upto you and really is dependent on how long you are there and what you like. If you could only do one other thing then fulfill the [famous gerry and the pacemakers song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loyRYFUYg9g) and take a ferry across the mersey. There run as [sightseeing tours](http://www.merseyferries.co.uk/) at all times other than peak hours, plus it connects a few of the major tourist destinations along the docks.

* -Other things which are options i can vouch for: the beatles story (liverpool is home of the beatles), the liverpool museum (story of the city), the world museum, a couple of decent art galleries (walker and tate). 
- If your staying for a longer period than a couple of days, consider visiting the surrounding areas: manchester, lancaster, chester and york are all an hour or so away and are nice day or half day trips.

- Keep in mind that Liverpool is equidistant from London to Edinburgh. I personally would say Edinburgh is the most amazing city in the UK and well worth at least a couple of days. It's also only a 3hour train from Liverpool or a four hour express train to london. So if your planning some sort journey through the north of england, definitely consider it. 
- Finally, book your trains in advance where possible. thetrainline.com is probably the best. Trains booked on the day are normally 60gbp or more, where they go for 10-20gbp if more than a few days in advance.

true,zumzink,null,null,"I didn't agree with some of the points made, but that was a good read. Thanks. :) One thing I found strange was the writer's insistence that Tennant's Doctor was at times so arrogant, dangerous and unlikeable. 

Partly because ALL doctors I've seen have those qualities. It's a defining element of the character that gives The Doctor depth, instead of having a 2-dimensional goody-goody hero character. 

Like *The Sarah Connor Chronicles*, the audience sees the ugly consequences of the characters' actions and the unavoidable fallout that comes with bearing an unfathomable responsibility. The ratio of hero to monster is dialed up and down by different actors, but the elements have always been there in every incarnation I've seen.

So to say that Tennant's portrayal in particular is unlikeable just seems off-base to me. I find Matt Smith's portrayal far more unpleasant. A lot of the charm is lost for me, making him frequently seem just like a selfish, arrogant jerk. Which may partly be a generational thing, where the irony and detachment of the current youth culture gets poorly translated into the second reboot. 

When Tennant tells someone ""shut up!"" it comes across as a brusque response under times of stress, where one doesn't have time or presence of mind for the normal social politeness. When Smith says ""shut up!"" (which he does OFTEN, to just about anyone) it comes across as rude, unnecessarily dismissive, and sometimes outright douchey. So again I'm a bit confused as to why the writer felt that Tennant was a more harsh character than other actors' interpretations.

**NOTE: SPOILERS BELOW FOR THOSE THAT HAVEN'T FINISHED TENNANT'S DOCTOR (season 3 &amp; 4).** *There was too much to put in a spoiler tag below. It would've made discussion very awkward.*

I'm also surprised that the writer didn't mention the one thing that really does make Tennant different from other incarnations: the 10th Doctor wanted to STAY the 10th Doctor. 

Tennant's Doctor had a strong sense of individualism as an incarnation as well as a strong sense of mortality as a regeneration. I think his performance in *The Family of Blood* echoes his reaction at the end of Tennant's reign in *End of Time.* 

This is the first Doctor I know of who did not want to leave (regenerate) and wanted to stay as he was, with the identity he was. The first Doctor to view his incarnation as a individual life, not just an appendage of a larger character. That's pretty radical for the Doctor Who universe IMO. And Tennant brought so much humanity to that concept.",0,1330038877,null,0,false,0,c3uc9tl,t3_q2ntg,t1_c3uc9tl,t3_q2ntg,null,1428408844,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,ropers,null,null,"It's kinda interesting to correlate national-economic power and practices in relation to foreign-made films and TV productions:

* Smaller Western European countries: Generally show imported foreign-made films and TV programs in the original language, with subtitles. In the case of English, even subtitling is sometimes omitted – some U.S. films e.g. are shown as is.

* Russia and other Eastern European countries: Often inexpensively dubs foreign-made films/TV programs by using voice-over: Local voice talent or lectors read the translations over the original audio track, and the results sound as if there were a simultaneous interpreter at your side throughout the film/program. Recently, Russia has moved to doing more full dubbing and less voice-over dubbing, which again seems to correlate with national/economic developments.

* Germany and several other big Western European countries: Just about everything is fully dubbed. Germany has the most advanced dubbing industry in the world. From Billy Mays to Sir David Attenborough: Every voice that's not German is completely replaced with a German one, no matter if it's English or Estonian, and no matter if the speaker is acclaimed or advertising. It's all turned into German. If you live in Germany or one of those bigger Western European countries, you have to make an active effort to hear anything other than the local language. Curiously, this is not true in the UK, where e.g. French or German films are often shown with original audio and subtitles. (NB: A lot of kids and adults in smaller Western European countries speak English a lot better than their German/French/etc. counterparts, and you can wonder why...)

* The United States of America: Generally does not fuck around with subtitles, voice-over dubbing or even full dubbing. If you live in the US and you want to watch a foreign film, that's a completely different category and arguably somewhat of a niche phenomenon. As for mainstream media productions, the US mostly don't dub foreign stuff to bring it to US screens, oh no: They buy the rights to the series/film, and remake it for the US market. Foreign-made stuff getting through to a US mainstream media audience? *No one comes to The Homeland except through me.* (And on a mostly unrelated note: Curiously, some demonstrators outside of the US in non-English speaking countries go so far as to sometimes carry English-language posters, seemingly on the odd chance of a US news camera showing up. Evidently said demonstrators know very well how independent, sovereign and free from US interference in their internal affairs their nations really are.)",0,1330040690,null,0,true,0,c3uclxd,t3_q2wc8,t1_c3uclxd,t3_q2wc8,null,1428409001,10,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,10

Guests can wear whatever they want, within reason; I think I've seen people in there with football shirts and trackies before. Of course, a lot of guests go in there assuming it's a classy joint, so a fair few guests wear suits and ties as well.

No cigars. If you're going to smoke, you'll buy whatever you can from the Sports and Social club. That means Marlboros and Silk Cuts. The main MPs' bar opens right on to a riverside terrace, so there's plenty of smoking going on out there.

As far as conversation goes, it's incredibly variable. Since there are MPs in there from across the country, you'll find a good few of them glued to the football every night there's a match. Hartlepool versus the Isle of Wight? There'll be a few MPs watching that!

Otherwise, conversation is (understandably) very political. 'How are you voting on this?' 'Do you reckon Miliband has a chance?' 'How do you deal with vexatious constituents?'

Rose wants the adventure.

Later, I learned about the Daleks, and for some reason I thought it was a sci-fi/fantasy mix with a sort of wizard as protagonist who faces off against these weird looking Daleks. In retrospect, I don't think the wizard thing was too far off. I also new that a traveling police box was involved at some point.

I heard about it later from a professor, but I hadn't watched it.

My first memory of actually watching it was staying up late one night and seeing The Doctor's Daughter on Sci-Fi channel.  I had started somewhere in the middle of it, so I didn't know what I was watching.  The fish aliens and the pseudo military look made me think it was one of those cheesy sci-fi channel movies, which happened to be exactly what I thought would be interesting that night.  It looked like light watching fair, not too serious, but fun. I was surprised at how hooked I got though, and when the credits rolled, I realized what I was watching and sought out more. It also helps that I was a huge fan of Trek up to voyager, and was looking for a good sci-fi series.

true,SouthPads,cnty-england,England,"How about:

&gt;You could also attribute British societies suppressed acceptance of sexism, racism and homophobia to Christianity.

First of all, Britain is one of the most liberal countries in the world, second only to the Scandinavian nations.

Secondly, we have a history of much lesser racism than our historical contemporaries. People hark on about Ireland, but nobody ever looks at Belgium's behaviour in the Congo, Or Germany's massacre of the Herero people, or Italy's behaviour in Libya.

Britain has never been more ""homophobic"" than any other nation. People have always feared threats to the status quo and to a certain extent I think they can be forgiven for it.

you said:

&gt;Claiming justice for the oppressed, healing the sick, and compassion to the poor are from Christian influences is factually wrong and slanderous to atheists and people from other religions.

I disagree. What people so convieniently forget is that life before around 1900 was bitterly difficult for 95% of the population. People would do anything to get by, up to and including murdering their fellow man. Religion (of any kind!) was a bulwark against this, instilling a sense of at least SOME kind of base, universal morality and indeed controlling the populace to some degree.

Charity itself in our country comes from the religious orders, the Knights Hospitaler and Templar.

How about this:

&gt;There is little or nothing in these examples that has anything to do with Christianity but an awful lot to do with the church/state trying to imprint its control on the people. It's a short history indeed.

Religious holidays have almost nothing to do with the organised chuch and are (by their very nature!) grassroots affairs! the vast majority of them were pagan festivals which continued to be celebrated, and the church was forced to allow these celebrations which gradually became more Christian as the dark ages progressed.

Or this:

&gt;All of the Christian holidays were stolen and used from the pagan calendar - at least point this out.

No they were not stolen, they were absorbed by ex-pagans, as opposed to the organised church.

As Britain has become more secular charity has increased and violence has gone down, I don't think that's down to secularism but it certainly tells us that morality and religion have little to do with each other. That's ignoring the many crimes done in Christianity's name, and what Christians are doing in our society today. Notice how this completely stupid person isn't countered by an opposing perspective.

Agreed, however the the article doesn't put it is so many words. It puts up an attack on an organisation (to take CofE) which is completely passive. It irritates me that they aren't equally damning of all religions in general. Bad journalism is my main gripe.

Absorbed is very different from stolen. Stolen implies the organised Catholic church took the celebrations from the Pagans. When in fact, the Pagans just put Christianity into their Paganism THEMSELVES.

Haven't you ever wondered why there is so much paganism in Chistianity?

Hypocrisy is something to be avoided, it does not mean you can't criticise. We seem to be raised on the idea that ""if you shop at tesco you can't say tesco is bad"" its hypocritical but it doesn't make you *the same as* Tesco.

The Guardian is run like a business and so it finds ways to make money; they oppose tax avoidance *morally* but until the Government stops it it would be an inappropriate strategy, business wise. The Government has the *power* to change the game, making their competitors, and everyone else, not benefit from tax avoidance.

We are *all* victims of strategy; very few people have the power to change what our strategies might be. In the same way I'm critical of energy companies and pharmaceutical companies yet still buy their energy and drugs, the guardian is doing what it sees best for survival.

So could these large banks be pulling a scam off right in front of our noses? Hell yes they could and it would be in keeping with that sort of mindset that of greed is good.

It strikes me that in the throes of recession banks, contrary to popular belief, do rather well out of things. They consolidate all their debts, they get governments to plough tax revenues into further boosting their coffers while simultaneously buying up liquidated assets from those who were not strong enough to weather the storm that they created in the first place. I am right I think that this is what happened in the 30's 70's 80's 90's and now in the 21st century.

On the whole I don't subscribe to wild conspiracies but I am still troubled by the lack of transparency in a world where communication and record keeping is the most efficient it has been in history of civilisation.

true,phillyharper,null,null,"Googling this I came across a very strange set of articles by a guy called David Wilcox (who's wikipedia page would suggest he's quite 'out there'). Anyway, I gave it the benefit of the doubt as it seemed to be the most in depth coverage of all of this stuff, involving Riyadi, the 'fake' bonds, and so on.

The who story is on his website in an entirely unedited fashion, it's probably 30,000 - 50,000 words or so. I didn't read all of it, but here's the tldr version.

In the 1930's and during WW2, the Federal Reserve (a private, not Federal bank) did a number of things to 'claim' all of the worlds gold. Through collaboration, conspiracy, and conquest, they ended up with almost all of the supply. In return for this gold, the Fed issued these bonds, and the deal was that in war torn Earth, the Fed would ensure the gold didn't fall into the hands of the 'wrong people'.

Anyway, this created a massive massive MASSIVE pile of wealth in two forms. 

1) In a massive gold deposit (which the article suggests is in The Phillipines somewhere)
2) These tresury bonds.

The rest of the article/writing is difficult to get to the bottom of, but this was my interpretation.

The money/assets from this gold haul was used to create a 'shadow economy'. Sort of like a huge, and I mean ridiculously mind bendingly huge, credit line which 'the right' people could dip in and out of. There was a suggestion that you can't get anywhere near this 'club' unless you have at least 500 million USD.

So this shadow economy has been doing various things since WW2, funding various endevours, and the people behind it have kind of run themselves into the ground. These bonds which are being found all over the place are in fact real (the article says) and the US treasury never had any intention of cashing them. What they are doing is going round, reclaiming these ridiculosly large treasury bonds and declaring them fake, siezing them, and not paying out on them.

The story (on the website) ends with an interview with three or four, maybe five, possibly six people, who are bringing this huge case to court. They are lawyers and private investigators who represent a family who are owed a huge sum of money by the FED, and they've been investigating all of this for the last five years or so. It is apparently, and seemingly very quietly, going to court very soon.

I realise that's a very long tldr, but the writing on the website is essentially a book. I hope I summarised it well enough.

I wrote to him and I was as polite and as helpful as I could be. I think he's probably been laughed off at The House of Lords, and regardless of what you might think, I don't believe we have any right to be rude or condescending. With that in mind, here's what I wrote.

Dear Lord James of Blackheath,


I wrote to you many months ago regarding Foundation-x, and was pleased by your response. I hope you remember my letter.

I'll be brief this time. You've spoken again in the House of Lords, this time regarding Joseph Riyadi and a $15,000,000,000,000 transfer to the RBS.

The name Joseph Riyadi, as I'm sure you're now aware, is on a list of documented scams as registered by The Federal Reserve themselves. The link is listed below:

http://www.ny.frb.org/banking/frscams.html

That doesn't mean of course, that the mystery is solved. It certainly doesn't bode well for it being properly investigated. I suggest, that in light of this, you release the content of your USB data stick online and let the wider online community take a look.

Blur out any sensitive information if you must, but if this is a scam, it's time to get to the bottom of it so no one else can be taken in.

You mentioned that you have the signed receipts for the transfer of this large amount of money? Can that be released online? Does it look anything like the one at the link below which also mentions Riyadi?

There's some more information on it here:

http://pppkingdom.wordpress.com/2011/06/17/yohannes-riyadi/

I hope all of this helps with your investigation.

Please consider releasing the data you have online so people have the chance to get to the bottom of this scam.

It may well be that once reviewed by a UK judge he would more than likely have been extradited but to have to take on trust that the US authorities have a case that warrants extradition by UK standards is difficult.

If, as you suggest, the batteries were ITAR restricted I agree that it would almost be a rubber stamp process for extradition. But at least the case would have to pass muster by UK standards.

It is unrealistic to claim that US judicial/legal attitudes to terrorist accusations is proportionate to the UK stance, particularly when one considers the more political nature of the US judiciary.  
This is especially true of Federal Judges of whom this would almost certainly come under the purview.

I do have some sympathy for him in that he faces trial in a country that has no duty or loyalty to him and is marked by moral panic over a very closely related issue.
