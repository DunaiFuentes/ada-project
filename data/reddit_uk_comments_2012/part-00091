That's essentially all we have to go by, but where there's smoke, there's usually fire. Won't say it's fact, though.

&gt; Yes, he completes a lot of passes. So does Ryan Shawcross. Does this mean RC is comparable to Xavi? Obviously not.

Completely different positions. Not comparable at all. Completely wrong in addition, Modric completed over 2000 passes with 88% completion while Shawcross completed 600 with 60%.

&gt; Xavi has two things going for him that modric doesn't. 1. He creates goals. 2. He scores goals. 

Wrong and wrong. He just had his best season in terms of assisting and scoring, but he's also passing to one of the best players in the history of the game while Modric is passing to Adebayor. Xavi had 10 goals and 7 assists. Hardly world class numbers without context, and generally he gets just over half that, around 5 and 5 on average, but those numbers, no one would ever argue that Xavi is one of the greatest ever, because there's other, more important aspects to his game, same as Modric. 

&gt; Plus Xavi actually dictates play from an advanced position. Most barca moves start or end with him. Modric does nothing but recycle possession and he doesn't even do that as well as Parker or Sandro. 

Most of Barca's passing moves start with either the centerbacks or Busquets, and Xavi doesn't generally play a more attacking role than Modric, but as a byproduct of the amount of possession around the box they have, he generally appears to be higher on the pitch. Modric has created almost 50% more scoring opportunities than Xavi this season, and more than anyone in the Premiership except for Mata and Silva, so I'm not getting where this whole ""only recycles possession"" thing is coming from. Parker and Sandro combined made a third of the key passes that Modric did, completed 40 fewer crosses, completed half as many long balls, and successfully made half as many through balls. 

&gt; Finally, I'm sick of modric lovers saying he doesn't get assists because the team is set up to play along the wings but in the same breath they will complain that modders can't get assists because teams park the bus and close down space

I never said anything about teams parking the bus.

&gt; Yet the stats clearly show that it's the wingers getting most of the assists. Curious. 

Actually most of the assists came through the center of the pitch (Ade and Van der Vaart combined for 18 assists while Bale and Lennon created 15). And that's how our team is set up. Look at Ade's goal that Lennon assisted against Bolton. Lennon got the assist, Ade got the goal. Who actually created it? Modric, he saw Lennon's run and put in a perfect through ball, all Lennon had to do was to make a simple pass to Ade after that who tapped it in. I'm not in the ""OMG MODRIC BEST EVAR"" camp, but I think you're really underselling him by looking at stats that don't reflect his game. You may as well criticize Lennon for not making enough tackles.",0,1342584999,null,0,false,0,c5fm2bz,t3_wqg5f,t1_c5fm2bz,t1_c5flkec,null,1429404072,13,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,13

true,twasbrilligand,null,null,"Okay, these are the episodes that made such an emotional impact on me I was thinking about them days later.

Also ***SPOILERS EVERYWHERE*** and I don't know which ones to tag, so ***READ AT YOUR OWN RISK***.

* The Family of Blood. There were a lot of parts that got to me (the boys crying as they think they're killing real people, John Smith's terror and resentment toward the Doctor and his life, Joan losing the love of her life for the second time, etc.) but what puts this episode on my list is the [Fury of the Time Lord](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC0NuBaliLs) scene. It's a side of the Doctor we really hadn't seen before then. It's a moment where he slips from behind his mask of silliness and aloofness. You get to see a glimpse of his true power and character. And it's terrifying.

* Midnight. At the beginning it gives you the impression that it'll just be light filler, but it turns out to be one of the darkest and scariest episodes IMO. It's terrifying because it realistically shows how panicked humans react to situations they don't understand. And also because the Doctor is completely helpless and Tennant does an amazing job of portraying it. The acting and scripting and just EVERYTHING in this episode is absolutely brilliant. The last scene of the episode is great as well-- when Donna is trying to cheer the Doctor up and he just shuts her down, obviously shaken by what just happened. It's something you see so many times before but it's just so much more *real* in this episode.

* Turn Left. It was just so unexpectedly dark. I knew before I watched it that the premise was that the Doctor wasn't around to prevent any disasters after the events of The Runaway Bride, so I expected it to be pretty depressing. But the way they portrayed a world that was slowly coming to its end, one disaster at a time, was so realistic and scary that it literally gave me chills. And Donna's sacrifice at the end was pretty intense as well.

* The Waters of Mars. I haven't found anyone else that reacted to it the way I did. The climactic scene was one of the most emotionally intense scenes of the series for me. I don't know if it was the dialogue, the dramatic tension, the characterization or what. It was probably a combination if everything. But I still consider the Doctor's realization that there is nobody to stop him one of the best scenes of the series so far. It's another moment (like in The Family of Blood) when you see what he's really capable of. That and he's pretty much coming to terms with being the last of his kind-- just in time for him to kill all of them again! Also, the scene where he brought the astronauts back to Earth. The captain's suicide and the Doctor's sudden awareness that what he did was wrong are very intense as well.

* The End of Time Part II. Basically just the whole episode. If I broke it down into parts this comment would be exponentially longer.

Edit: Haha, just realized these are all Tennant episodes. I like Matt as the Doctor, but his episodes have never made as much of an emotional impact on me as Tennant's.

Both of those guys are far from the primary creative talent in the center, which is how a lot of people view a Xavi or Modric. They are both paired with Kroos and Ozil, who are far more creative.  
  
Honestly, I really doubt Modric and Alonso will be the first choice pairing for Madrid.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"I wouldn't be opposed to a season long loan for him. He was a very good player for us at left back at the end of 10/11 season. He might have very well cost us Champions L

That said, we also need cover at left back. We're kind of in the unfavorable position of having several players who could very easily be starting at fullback for other teams. It's one thing to have depth, it's entirely different to have unhappy players who should be getting games somewhere. 

Naughton proved he's more than capable on either side, and Rose could definitely cut it as a left sided player at a mid-table team. 

Personally I'd like to avoid at all costs seeing Vertonghen forced out to the left. He's capable there, but it's such a fucking waste of his skill set. Plus he's been brought in surely to start at CB and it's kind of sketchy to have your only depth at one position be a key player at another.

If we get rid of some of the older CMs, like Benayoun, Malouda, and Essien, then by all means, spend big on another, but if we still have these guys, buying even more will only hurt the youngsters we have now. Our priority should be to improve players like de Bruyne, Romeu, and McEachran, and as it stands now, buying another CM only serves to lessen the chances they get.

I know he's injury-prone, but when fully fit he can play the same 90 minutes as everyone else and has shown this on a number of occasions.

The reason he was subbed off so often under 'Arry is because if we were going stale offensively and needed a late goal he'd want to introduce Defoe to try and nick one from nowhere.  He clearly thought of Rafa as essentially the withdrawn striker in a 4-4-2 so that was the natural substitution.  It obviously irritated Rafa to be substituted that early on a number of occasions, and I don't think there's any evidence that it's *necessary*.  Sometimes, sure.

true,scg30,1953,Frank Lampard,"I don't think you're giving Schweini or Alonso enough credit for their creative input. Both are masters of the through-ball from midfield, and the diagonal long ball over the top of the defense both of which help get the forwards in behind the defenders in order to *create* scoring opportunities.

Granted, they're not normally creative in a neat and tidy, fancy foot-work, quick one two, short slip passes in and around the box kind of way, but neither is Modric primarily. Those attributes are more accurately ascribed to players like Ozil for Real Madrid, and too a slightly lesser extent Kroos* at Bayern who you mention, and Rafael van der Vaart for Spurs, whom you don't mention. Modric is a bit more versatile than all of these players, bar maybe Kroos, in that he's capable of operating 'creatively' in a more advanced role just off the forwards, but possesses vision, passing range, and tackling ability enough to merit his placement a bit further back in central midfield where he can retain possession, spread the passes and control the game more. Especially when there are players like Ozil or van der Vaart in the sqaud who can operate effectively as the CAM in the hole ahead of him.

You have a point about Khedira's work rate, but while Alonso may tend to linger in and around the center cirlce, I think you're selling Modric a bit short. When he's played in a central-midfield pairing for Spurs he drifts around quite a lot, though he doesn't harry and hassle the way Khedira, Gustavo, or say Parker do, he does manage to put himself about a bit. This, imo, is because the 'creative' CAM player at Spurs (Rafa vdV) tends to be a bit more stationary himself, often loitering around the edge of the central penalty area, as opposed to players like Kroos or especially Ozil, whose movement in the final third tends to be more fluid. Having said all that,  I do think that given the appropriate tactical situation/opposition a Modric+Alonso central midfield pairing could be devastating for Real Madrid.


*Kroos is an interesting case to bring up. He seems a bit frustrated playing in a more advanced CAM role imo, though he's proven more than capable of excelling there. I think he would be better suited to a deeper position more like a no 8 than a no 10.

true,ravniel,num11,,"Honestly, this supposed 'gentleman's agreement' - far from being the saving grace that makes me understand Luka's position - is actually the thing that really irritates me about his whole saga.

I'm not the least bit offended that he wants to leave us for a team who might very well win the Champions League in the next season or two.  Spurs have not even secured the status of regular participants, and from there it's still a hard road to the final.  In the meantime if he goes to Madrid he'll pick up league titles, oh, every other season or so.  I can't blame any player to whom that sounds attractive.

What irritates me is his insistence on this idea of a gentleman's agreement.  Personally I think it's fairly unlikely this ever existed the way Luka claims it did.  It's clear that he believed if a big club like Chelsea came in for him he'd be sold without any fuss; why the hell would Levy possibly agree to that?  What is even the point of *signing* a long-term contract if not to make his acquisition by a bigger club more difficult?  We weren't trying to keep him from being poached by fucking Fulham.  A long contract on a player like Modric is *specifically protection from clubs like Chelsea*.  The idea that Levy said ""yeah, sign till 2016, but if anyone richer than us comes knocking we'll call the whole thing off"" is just ludicrous to me.

I think what happened is that Levy said something like ""and of course, if the right offer came in and it was in the best interests of the club we'd be willing to let you go"" and Luka heard what he wanted to hear.  I seriously doubt he was lied to, if for no other reason than because the lie makes no damned sense.",0,1342592605,null,0,false,0,c5fnp92,t3_wqdsc,t1_c5fnp92,t1_c5fjkuy,null,1429404834,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6
true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"For starters, I'd just like to say that I think the second option is overboard. Even just mentioning seasons, or Doctors. It's just a tad obsessive, plus you get into the fine details of what exactly is a spoiler for each thing. In the new series, The Doctor regenerates for the first time at the end of season 1, so that might be a spoiler for someone who doesn't know about regeneration. So now do I have to spoiler tag every time I talk about Regeneration? I think it would make the subreddit look like an overly cited MLA essay.

**However**, I think it should apply to just the current season if the entire season is to be spoiler tagged. While the 48 hour rule was in effect, if I dared to come here, I would feverishly avoid spoiler threads. If *everything* from the current season is spoiler tagged, then it will make it harder to discern posts with information you know from posts with information you don't. Otherwise you would turn the subreddit into an absolute 'do not enter' zone for anyone not caught up to the very latest episode.

As for discussion on the first point, while 48 hours might have been too short for many, I think having it be the current and last season is too long.  People aren't always going to remember to spoiler tag information from the last season, especially in the comments. And I think the more people have to think things like,""Wait...did this happen last season,"" the more the rules will get in the way of the enjoyment of people in this subreddit. Especially with rules that will have popped up overnight(Let's be honest, the majority of people subscribed will not partake in this discussion). I also personally think extending spoilers to more than the current+future seasons is creating a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. Most people who have not caught up to at least the current season will, more than likely, avoid this subreddit outside of making a post of 'Where do I start?"" or ""Just finished season 2!"" Even amongst these people, most of them do not partake in active discussion here.

I'm all for ushering in new people, but I think pushing beyond the current season will only inconvenience those already here more than it will help those new to the series.

If you want to be helpful to new Whovians, than I think a much better way would be to put a link at the top of the subreddit(Exactly like the current link that brings people here), but with something like,""New to Doctor Who? Start here!"". Have it link to a post, or something, discussing very briefly where the 'Start in' points are for the 2005 series(Season 1 and season 5), and have the ups and downs for starting in each spot. Then describe the spoiler system to help them understand what to look out for so they don't get spoiled. Also letting them know that if they make posts describing no spoilers beyond season X, that it is part of our rules to respect that when discussing Doctor Who within their post. Just like it is done now, but more official. I think that's a much better solution, so people who are new can still discuss if they want to without turning every thread here into a spoiler thread of some sort.",0,1342592686,null,0,false,0,c5fnpsg,t3_wpvd7,t1_c5fnpsg,t3_wpvd7,null,1429404842,26,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,26

In my case, I am Indian, came to study at a top English Uni in 2008 September. Part of my attraction to studying in the UK was the job opportunities after graduation (as compared to the US), specifically the 2 year Post Study Worker (PSW) Visa which allows you to stay in the country for 2 years after graduation and work with any company etc. After spending a metric fuck tonne of money on tuitions and living costs, the government then randomly decided to get rid of the PSW visa two months before I graduated which was fucking annoying to say the least. It made my life much harder and ridiculously difficult for me to get a job as the employer would have to sponsor me straight of the bat - when they might as well just employ a British graduate. 

Immigrants like me are the people you should be keeping in the country - smart, well educated, ingrained into society. I loved my time at uni, I loved all the people I met - I didn't do what most Indian/British Indian students do and stick with the same crew of Indian friends - I went out and met new people, started playing a new sport which I now love. On top of that I have spent over £50,000 just on tuition, its the least the government could do is give prior warning of what is going to happen. E.g. set a later cutoff of date for when the PSW would be removed so it only affects students who will be coming in the future and not those already there and committed to studying in the UK. Now I am back in India trying to find a job - which is difficult even with good qualifications since it is late in the recruiting cycle and most graduate recruitment by the big companies is done when they visit campuses and interview there and then.

I am not saying it is right, but that is how it is. When you look at the cost of getting a drug from bench to production, both in terms of money and time, you can see why they are this way. Many of the initial discoveries come from academia, which is usually funded by grants, when something new and interesting is published, that is when the pharmas come on board and develop the idea further. However most of the research done never leaves the bench, much less get onto animal and clinical trials, that is the nature of the beast. It is also worth noting that if the research is not being focused on these diseases at the academia level then the pharmas are even less likely to research into them.

I could create an account Hdh737 now, and send a thoroughly abusive tweet to some named person, and they and all their followers could see it, but none of the people I know. The social stigma only comes when my friends, parents, wife, children, colleagues, neighbours etc find out about it. The equivalent in real life is a football crowd, where someone in the crowd, safe in their anonymity, shouts racist abuse at a player, and the question is whether or not clubs or police should go back through CCTV to find the culprit.

Now clearly there's a difficulty with the internet, because you don't want general surveillance. What I'd say is that, if Twitter make it clear that they will provide your IP to the police if requested, and celebrities use the website on that basis (that it is a safe place) and you sign up and abuse someone, it's right that there should be the same consequences as in the real world. If you want to argue that abuse should fall within free speech, ok, but there should be a degree of consistency between the real world and the internet. Or if you want to go to a different, uncooperative website, outside of British jurisdiction, that's where we draw the line at enforcement. And presumably celebrities will stay away on that basis.

""1. The Tea Party was not a protest against high taxes. The Boston Tea Party was certainly a tax protest, but it was not a protest against high taxes. In fact, it was sparked by a tax cut, not a tax hike.
 
The Tea Party was part of a longer protest against British taxation of the North American colonies. The conflict had its roots in the French and Indian War (known as the Seven Years' War in Europe). Having run up a huge debt fighting the war -- and defending the colonies from external threat -- the British thought the colonists should help pay it back. But the colonists had other ideas, and they resisted British attempts to collect new taxes. In 1765 they objected to the Stamp Act, insisting that Britain could levy taxes only to regulate trade, not raise revenue. London capitulated. The next year Parliament took another run at the colonial purse, imposing the Townshend duties on a variety of goods imported into the colonies, including paper, paint, lead, glass, and tea. Once again the colonists organized boycotts and protests, and once again Britain backed down. But rather than repeal all the Townshend duties, Parliament chose to retain the tax on tea, chiefly to underscore the government's right to impose such a levy.
 
For a while the colonists seemed content to ignore that imperial assertion. But in 1773 Parliament passed the Tea Act, which left the Townshend duty on tea intact, but repealed another tax on tea imported to Great Britain for subsequent reshipment to the colonies. This amounted to a tax cut on colonial tea, promising lower prices for colonial consumers.
 
Bostonians responded by dumping their cheap imported tea into Boston Harbor.""

""But was the original tea party a protest against high taxes? Not really. In fact, the Boston Tea Party was sparked by a tax cut, not a tax increase. That colonial exercise in civil disobedience was certainly a protest against oppressive taxation, but it was also a revolt against tax preferences. Specifically, the tea party was sparked by an 18th century version of corporate welfare.""

Its principal overt objective was to reduce the massive surplus of tea held by the financially troubled British East India Company in its London warehouses and to help the struggling company survive. A related objective was to undercut the price of tea smuggled into Britain's North American colonies. This was supposed to convince the colonists to purchase Company tea on which the Townshend duties were paid, thus implicitly agreeing to accept Parliament's right of taxation. The Act granted the Company the right to directly ship its tea to North America and the right to the duty-free export of tea from Britain, although the tax imposed by the Townshend Acts and collected in the colonies remained in force. It received the royal assent on May 10, 1773.

Colonists in the Thirteen Colonies recognized the implications of the Act's provisions, and a coalition of merchants and artisans similar to that which had opposed the Stamp Act 1765 mobilized opposition to delivery and distribution of the tea. The company's authorised consignees were harassed, and in many colonies successful efforts were made to prevent the tea from being landed. In Boston, this resistance culminated in the Boston Tea Party on December 16, 1773, when colonists (some disguised as Native Americans) boarded tea ships anchored in the harbour and dumped their tea cargo overboard.

true,waydee,null,null,"British TV only seems to eveer achieve a 'cult following' in the US, mass market appeal is pretty rare and limited to a few things like Monty Python, Benny Hill (shudder) etc.  

It's probably a lot to do with the fact that the big US TV networks won't even try showing original UK shows because it's too much of a gamble so they end up on less popular networks, often edited to fit into 30 minute (22ish minutes + ads) programming slots.  Then of course there's the American expectation for 12+ episode seasons and a long run as opposed to the UK standard of around 6 episodes and usually a much shorter run.  

The reason it's a gamble to show the original series does seem to be a cultural thing, the average US viewer seems less willing or able to relate to a character with a foreign accent, in a foreign setting or with too many foreign cultural references that they're probably not aware of.  Europe has a long tradition of importing a lot of television and showing it alongside the homegrown stuff so this doesn't phase the viewership whereas in the US very little foreign television has ever been given equal footing with the US made stuff.

Then you have to consider the sheer size of the US Film and TV industry, an industry that has for a long time been the worlds dominant producer of entertainment.  For good or bad the success of this industry almost ensures that foreign entertainment isn't likely to be given the same potential to succeed in the home market.

It's a good 5-6 hour drive from London and to get back out you have to drive the way you came. The north coast of Cornwall is full of tourists, especially places like Newquay. The south coast of Cornwall is slightly less touristy\*, and full of nice places and little beaches like [Kynance Cove](http://www.parcangrouse.com/images/Kynapan.JPG). Unfortunately the most popular beaches will be packed in the summer, but there will *always* be some of the lesser-known beaches with just a handful of people.

If you want to see a little more of Cornwall, I'd take a look at this [BBC test video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok06G7E07Ik). It's 15 years old, but the scenery hasn't changed much. Feel free to ask me where any locations are.

*Or at least less chavy - seems to attract middle class tourists.

I certainly approve of your choice to go to Scotland, though the only time I holidayed there it rained constantly. This probably holds true for anywhere in the UK. On the other hand, even going for a drive around [Glen Coe ](http://www.vanderpijl.org/picture_library/schotland%20glencoe.jpg) is quite an experience. Last year I drove a minibus full of Three Peaks challengers through the highlands, and felt like I was on a very strong natural high throughout.

If you're driving to Scotland, you should know it's going to take A LONG TIME. Would recommend stopping off maybe in York or [Durham](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DydhBGGrRCU) for a day.

The majority of these retirees all bring money to a region that would otherwise (like Benidorm) still be a fishing village. The vast majority of local income comes from them. Most of the Spanish coast has accepted this for decades, precisely for this reason - it's a bit daft to become all nationalistic about people without whom the region wouldn't exist. And Al Jazeera don't seem to have noticed that you can walk into any of these areas and find groups that only speak Dutch, German...these people have *created* a lot of the areas they live in, and their money dictates how much influence they have compared to economic migrants. None of this is new, and it certainly isn't just about the English. In fact, the number of English has *gone down* since the Euro crash, as their money isn't worth as much any more; Dutch/ Germans don't have this problem.

It just gets sillier as it goes along - the article is blatantly trying to create a controversy where there isn't one. The presenter, for example, cites a local mayor as 'having to adapt to her northern invaders', as if these *investors* (which is what they actually are) have just popped out of nowhere. It's journalism channelling naivety to generate shock - I doubled-checked to make sure the presenter wasn't Chris Morris. It's laughable.

He then notes a local paper that 'has had to be produced in their native language' - again, presenting it as an 'issue' when actually, the Costa Blanca News (which is all in English) has been around since 1970. And you can get German and Dutch newspapers in any Pryca too - but I guess that wouldn't make it all so sensationalist.

Then we're exposed to the shock that local schools are having to speak English because of the number of foreign pupils - again, expressed as if this has only happened recently. Or that all Spanish schoolkids generally learn English as a second language anyway.

If you can't see the difference between economic migrants moving to your country in order to start *earning* money, and economic migrants that bring lots of money with them, you're really just looking for an excuse. And *that's* before we address Spain currently needing all the money it can get...

&gt; He had a series of short-term contracts. There was no continuous employment – a few days every month. It was this uncertainty of work that fed into his decision not to interrupt the flow of benefit – that was very poor judgment by him.      

I've been in that kind of situation and it isn't easy. Instead of benefits naturally increasing and decreasing as your income increases and decreases it is like a giant on/off switch that can take sometimes months to ""fix.""    

So if you have a big *pay day* then you might wonder if it is worth losing housing benefit for two months? I can 100% guarentee that people have avoided taking short-term work for exactly that reason (and I don't blame them).     

Now I will get a whole bunch of idiots calling people ""lazy"" because they ""want"" to stay on benefits instead of working; but that is a gross, if common, mischaracterisation. People would LOVE to get off of benefits but they're in the benefits ""trap.""

Someone rents the property from a company, pays slightly more than the mortgage on the property would be. When they decide to leave they get 50% of the money they paid over their tenancy as a deposit on getting their own property.

That way the mortgage gets paid every month for the owner, renter gets help to save towards a new home.

Only problem is the owner would take a hit in the pocket when tennant leaves.....

Maybe if Banks who re-possessed properties did this instead of auctioning the sites off, they could create a revenue stream into the business.

true,DirtySketel,eng-merseyside,Liverpool,"&gt; Dear Michael Gove,

&gt; As chair of Astrological Education Society, I am writing to seek your approval on a proposal for a new free school. The school shall follow the national curriculum, but also feature additional lessons dedicated to the study of celestial bodies as portents and signs.

&gt; Do not worry — we would still teach the mainstream scientific theories of astronomy. However, we believe it is important to give young people a balanced view, and that includes the fact that the alignment of planetary bodies with stellar bodies can have an effect on our lives. This science has applications in politics and indeed in medicine. Did you know that influenza is caused by the influence of the stars? This kind of knowledge will be useful to the future doctors in our society. After all, germ theory is only a theory.

&gt; As well as the national curriculum, we propose a full specification for the teaching of astrology, including the learning of the 12 signs of the Zodiac, as well as the other constellations, the movement of heavenly bodies through the sky, and what all of this means. Examinations will include filling out detailed horoscopes.

&gt; The most important message we want the children to take home is that there really is two sides to every scientific issue. Surely we want our children to decide for themselves on astrology and astronomy, alchemy and chemistry, and creation and evolution? These hotly debated scientific topics are so far being unfairly represented in the current curriculum.

&gt; With this in mind, and with your approval, I predict a bright future for our students.


&gt; Yours sincerely,

How many Eastern Europeans, Indians etc.. come here to work temporarily or study, *have no intention of staying here and eventually going back*, yet everyone will still EASILY call them immigrants, you can't even deny that. That's what this article is talking about, don't you get it?

Even going by your arbitrary rules, it doesn't work. The only thing that's left is class, which is what everyone here is saying ""hurr, we're rich so it doesn't count"" - fucking ridiculous.

See, your definition of immigrant is one defined by class and citizenship, and this is what the article talks about. How Brits will say xyz in order to maintain a false sense of superiority. Basically, twist the words around, become a spin doctor. This is something we are experts at doing anyway, considering English is this countries language, you would expect so.

Just because one is not looking to become a citizen, does not make them not an immigrant. It's one rule for everyone else and another for yourselves, and that's what the article is talking about.

There are no apples or oranges here, you *can* call an apple an orange if you want, but that doesn't change what it really is, just what you feel like saying it is.

It seems like you don't understand that there is no difference, you just want to make one for the sake of pretending you're better than everyone, and this is exactly what the article is talking about. You guys have all fallen hook line and sinker for what the author intended, and you can't even realise it.

The problem is alot of people here can't get over themselves. And this thread shows that even the younger generation still can't get over themselves, despite having absolutely nothing to do with the 'glory days' of Britain, and when the country is in one of its worst states ever.

[The cost of sports rights have gone up by 15.2% each year between 1997-2006. [PDF]](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review_report_research/vfm/sports_rights.pdf) The license fee however, doesn't rise to the same extent. In fact, right now it's frozen. As a result, there is only so much it can do but it still won't be able to compete with commercial rivals on sports offerings.

On the topic of Gary Lineker et al, and if indeed they're actually needed - I've often wondered what would happen to audience figures for the likes of Match of The Day etc if they were presented by 'nobodies' or unheard-of figures. Would removing familiar faces really impact an audience to the extent they switch off? But also, if the audience likes the current presenter(s), would they be keen on having him or her removed either?

I suppose the reverse argument is that the BBC can't just use existing expensive talent all the time, it has to nurture new presenters/talent somehow, whilst also saving money.

Regardless of all that, I personally, do still feel that the BBC is still immensely great value for money.

Just my two pennies.

Not generally. Sure, go to Benidorm and you can find that, but the majority of urbanizations wouldn't fit that description.

&gt;Spain isn't a third world country

No, it isn't; but we're not discussing Spain as a whole, we're talking about the areas that have vastly increased in size *purely through tourism*. It's also worth noting that the local Spanish councils heavily invested in many, many housing developments (which is partly why they're broke), and few of them were actually intended for the Spanish.

&gt;and the few months of British tourism the coasts get every year isn't the only thing that separates it from Haiti.

Well now you're including tourists, which isn't the same thing - buy a house in Spain and when you sell it, 40% of the profit goes to the state, unless you gain residencia (naturalisation). If you don't have a will, the State inherits your house. And that's before we get to the majority of tourists *and* ex-pats being from the rest of Europe, to say nothing of the Spanish tourists that come from the rest of the country.

&gt;They would do fine without us. 

It depends on how you're using 'fine' - for example, they'd be fine as long as they abandon most of the areas that have built up solely for this reason.

true,Gessekai,flair8,,"Hello, new fan! Welcome!

I don't want to be rude, but have you watched a lot of football?

So, here's the thing; Luka is an INCREDIBLE passer of the ball. He sees passing options where others see none. Luka at his best, is probably one of the best players currently active today. But that's what he's good at, passing the ball, and holding on to possession. Sometimes he does try to score a goal, and usually it ends up well wide, but I still love him for trying.

Thing is with football, you have a lot of different players and different play-styles. For example I think Ade &gt; Defoe, because Defoe is so focused on scoring that he usually have a go at it, even if there's an opening to pass to a better positioned player. So for the start of the game, I'd rather have Ade on the pitch. If we're down by a goal at 65-75 mins, and Ade isn't being productive, I'd switch to Defoe in an instant, because then we need a goal and he has the ego to score one.

Someone mentioned Parker in this thread, and while I love both Parker and Luka, they're not the same type of player. Parker is a hardworking big pitbull that runs people down, tackles them and take the ball. While Luka is more of a quick, little squirrel protecting his beloved nut; Luka will try to keep the ball at all cost and only give his precious nut to someone who is in a better position than himself. In all fairness, I thought I read somewhere that Parker and Luka had roughly the same passes completed statistics, but the thing is, Parker passes often to the side or to the back, while Luka passes forward (which is harder).

I agree with you that it's heartbreaking to see that Luka's heart doesn't seem to be in it, at least not every day... It makes me sad. But the Chelsea drama last season showed that he can perform still, even with us. When we started winning again Luka got better and better, probably as his confidence got better. I am god damned proud over the yids in the stands when Harry brought Luka on the first game (cannot remember which one) after the drama and while some booed, most of them cheered. I would have cheered, and I was so moved by the fans reaction it brought me to tears. [This video needs to be seen.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnKBkPh3CNo)

If I had the power to chose, I would keep Luka. Because I love him. I love him more than some players (hi, Gomes, sorry). I love how it makes me feel every time he gets the ball and tries to start an attack, I don't think anyone can make me feel that way (maybe Bale or Lennon when going straight at goal).",0,1342618019,null,0,false,0,c5fqtay,t3_wqg5f,t1_c5fqtay,t3_wqg5f,null,1429406372,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"There were alot of statements like that and i think part of that had to do with the whole saga and the circumstances surrounding it last summer.

The transfer being with Chelsea i think got under the skin of all of us, we had just come off a disappointment of missing CL and despite the performance Modders leaving combined with Uncle Harry's constant ""pep talks"" to the Media where he continually downplayed our chances combined with the fact that we were showing little effort to go out and strengthen the team int he transfer market (needed a striker only and had only signed Coulyibaly until last minute of the window) led to a great deal of pessimism. We felt like we were just on the verge of breaking through and the team wasn't making the moves that collectively we would make and now we were going to be selling one of our top players to a competitor with no replacement. As a result people took it very badly.

This year, well first off we all had a year to come to terms with the loss of Modders.  We showed we can hang with the big boys and would have been in CL if our manager hadn't taken half the season to daydream, we missed CL on a fluke and finished 2 spots ahead of the European Champions.  We hired a coach who screams ambition, we have made moves early (for the first time in years) and continue to be linked with quality players (both realistic and fantastical). On top of that Modders is being linked with a team that is out of England and happens to be one the true super powers in Europe.  

I think this summer we can see the light, last summer felt of disappointment, this summer feels like opportunity is knocking because of the way the team is doing things. We were so close last year and the team is showing the effort to try and not have it happen again. Losing Luka is tough but we will be having it happen in a time-frame to replace him and we won't have to face him this season.

What a difference a year makes.

It doesn't, if you ask me. His core argument is that the UK has a disdain for immigrants, talking about assimilation and in general will call anyone foreign an immigrant and start complaining about everything. And yet we have our own immigrants, who call themselves 'expats' for arbitrary reasons, ***and then use that very same arbitrary definition to justify their own ignorance and lack of assimilation towards their host countries***, in other words do as I say, not as I do. I'm not an immigrant, I'm an 'expat', so fuck off I can be just as I want to be. That's his argument, or a part of it.

It's widely reported that British tourists and immigrants (or 'expats') are some of the worst anyway.

The fact is, *even if* you want to keep having different words for different people. Foreigners are immigrants, we are only ever expats. That doesn't justify anything, expats should assimilate into their host countries, there's no excuse. The fact that people make up a word like expat and then use it to justify their own ignorance is horrible behaviour.

Corrections. There's a difference - I'd suggest 'insulted' would be better - unless you can provide contrary information from another *more accurate* source.

You're suggesting they won't be replaced by future, retiring generations, as has been the case for decades?

You're talking about communites that only exist because of the area that's grown *because of these people*.

&gt;adds pressure to water use so it has to be imported from other areas of spain

Ah, you're still taking the article as gospel and in no way biased - why not quibble about the two dozen council-funded acrobatic [water-fountains that can be found at many roundabouts on the main road from Alicante all the way up to Calpi?](http://www.tripadvisor.ie/VacationRentalReview-g187525-d2029577-Sierra_Cortina_Resort-Benidorm_Costa_Blanca_Alicante_Province_Valencian_Country.html). The ex-pats never pushed for this, it was an attempt to make areas like Benidorm 'more upmarket'.

&gt;your economic planners are being short sighted.

You mean the local Spanish councils.

&gt;Exactly.

Exactly what? That they've invested in the future of their main income?

&gt;You're waffling now

In other words, you don't understand.

&gt;whether there are 'security-controlled compounds' elsewhere is irrelevant to how one feels about the Spanish situation.

No, I'm giving examples of tourist destinations that *really* give no benefit to the locals in any way at all. All you've done is reiterate what the video says, which I would have thought I'd already demonstrated was stupidly one-sided, and ultimately irresponsible.

The fact that we have reached a point as a society where parents cover their kid's eyes or risk ""corrupting their minds with sexual imagery"" and we treat streakers the same as we treat child molesters is just sick and wrong.    

In my opinion it isn't naturalists who are perverted and twisted, it is the rest of society which is been brought to this point by thousands of years of moralists and religious nuts spinning their false moralities.

There's a few reasons. First, it's simply viewer trust. People know Gary Lineker (to take your example), and so they trust what he's fronting. Not consciously perhaps, but we take comfort in recognisable faces.

Second, interaction with other guests. Gary Lineker is good at what he does because of his personality - not just anybody can do that. It requires personality, likability, understanding and...

Experience. Now, he's not managing a football team or anything, but experience still helps with what he does. It makes him authoritative and trustworthy (going back to the first point). It's the same reason we have Sue Barker presenting Wimbledon, Clare Balding presenting horse racing, and so on.

And all of those things command a certain level of pay. The BBC could go cheaper and get 'nobodies', but would the output be as good and trustworthy? I'm not sure it would be.

Also, while I'm not claiming newsreading is curing cancer, I don't think it's quite as easy as you might believe.

Provided Torres is healthy, we are just gonna end up watching a disgruntled grumpy Berbatov on the bench for most of the season, eating up some decent wages I'm sure.

Obviously, my background is law, and I adore law, but that also means I'm acutely aware of its origins and its limitations. My personal political/philosophical guru puts it this way:

""I stand ready to negotiate, but I want no part of laws: I acknowledge none; I protest against every order with which some authority may feel pleased on the basis of some alleged necessity to over-rule my free will. Laws: We know what they are, and what they are worth! They are spider webs for the rich and mighty, steel chains for the poor and weak, fishing nets in the hands of government.""

&gt;Vandalism is pretty much accepted as being not ok. It's damaging property that is not oyur own. In your opinion it might be a case of the ends justifying the means, but that is another line of reasoning that is generally accepted as not ok.

Exactly, the agenda is set almost from the day you're born.  They most likely educated your parents and all you will come into contact with as a child, they wrote your school curricula, your dictionaries, your laws, they own your government, they own your employer, they probably own your church (if you have one), your leisure time is mostly spent under their spell...etc.  This isn't conspiracy theory, it's just capitalism.

So we can commandeer the headquarters of Proctor &amp; Gamble and convert it into a 24 hour rave spot, and we can paint all the trains green and purple (but only the privately owned Virgin ones, you must leave British Rail alone because they aren't a corporation).

Banksy is your hero ? I guess that speaks volumes.

Or possibly you are just fucking crazy. Or at a [10] ...

I'm not going to argue further with someone who has the world-view of a concussed haddock, probably doesn't actually OWN any property and thus doesn't know what it feels like when it gets fucked over by some asshole wanting to make a political statement without buying his own easel and canvas.

The idea that corporations are these magical beings is so blase, it ignores the fact that most corporations STARTED as mom-and-pop backyard businesses, where sacrifices and hard work built it into something huge and multinational - it also ignores the fact that regardless of what you think of corporations as an entity, the people they employ and the people who put the money in to it DO have rights, and therefore by abusing corporate assets, you are abusing PEOPLE's assets at the same time.

Whilst I believe in a secular society, with church and state separated, obviously we don't really have that in the UK (what with a state religion and bishops in the House of Lords). I just hope there can be enough of an uproar to reverse this decision. A lot of people won't care about the philosophy of a school if it's convenient (I was Christened so I could go to a school close to my mother's work - an example of the trend of a sudden and dramatic return to faith among new parents when a school is involved). People sticking with a school doesn't necessary imply support. It would be interesting to know how many who went to a creationist school were creationists. It would be nice to see the church pushed out of schools and back to the church.

As for the HPV business, I think the school should hold vaccination programmes in schools - let the children opt out, if they want, but don't let their religious fervour get in the way of massive public health benefits. This is, after all, a £$%^&amp; vaccine for *cancer*, essentially. Vaccinations should be as convenient as possible and, frankly, have *nothing* to do with religion.

too much moderation and banning of stuff that is relevant but some people are sick of seeing is going to end up driving people away...  switching to ""text only"" is even worse...  the attention span of most redditors isn't that big...  (not an insult, some just like to click, look and move on) and having nothing but text posts pop up will make people unsubscribe...  banning certain types of posts will make people unsubscribe...  when more and more people unsubscribe, less and less people will post stuff and the sub will slowly die because ass less content is posted, even more people will leave until there is only a handful of people here posting their little stories and theories and ideas...  I've seen forums and message boards and chat rooms die time and time again due to over-moderation and severe elitism, making new members afraid to join and participate in the community...  and I've been watching it happen for about 20 years now (I'm 40)

what I'd say is let people post stuff...  use the basic ""reddiquette"" rule of ""don't complain about [it] and just downvote it and it will take care of itself.""  else you will end up having a dead subreddit that everyone is afraid to post in because the moderation is too strict and they delete and ban people because they are elitist jerks...

on a more personal note, this sub has left a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth... I made a post here, posting a pic of something relevant I found in a game...  I noticed it one night and took a screen shot and was all excited to post it here and share my discovery with the group...  next time I checked it, I was admonished with a comment like, ""Yes, stuff like this shows up in games and stuff, we all know this.  You post will be deleted because we don't want that kind of stuff here.""  I felt like shit...my exact feeling was the [""okay rage face""](http://0.tqn.com/d/webtrends/1/0/B/A/-/-/okay-meme-face.jpg)...  even though I had seen many other posts that were similar and had many upvotes...  so I stopped posting here and I just read now...  but then I saw this and wanted to give my opinion and share my experience with online communities...  what you do is ultimately up to you, but think seriously on what I said.

I have a philosophy that the laws and government are basicly there to look out for everybody and keep the world running smoothly, the people in the system might not be so noble though.

&gt;Exactly, the agenda is set almost from the day you're born. They most likely educated your parents and all you will come into contact with as a child, they wrote your school curricula, your dictionaries, your laws, they own your government, they own your employer, they probably own your church (if you have one), your leisure time is mostly spent under their spell...etc. This isn't conspiracy theory, it's just capitalism.

Who the fuck is ""They""? What is their agenda? Use of the word ""they"" implies that there is a group of people working against ""me"", and that kind of phrasing really does make it sound like you're a nutter sharing a conspiracy theory. Please don't tell me you actually think that the rich are collaberating against the poor by controling churches and dictionaries. FFS there are billions of different dictionaries, why the fuck would ""they"" bother trying to control language when everybody knows language isn't static???

&gt;No it doesn't, necessarily. But - for example, if I steal to prevent mass murder, I consider myself good.

This is why ""The ends justify the means"" is such a dangerous philosophy: 50% of the time it works, and it seems obvious to people why theft is justified to prevent mass murder. The problem is that the other 50% of the time not everybody agrees that the ends really do justify the means, for example most people would not say that mass murder justifies the prevention of theft.

People's blood has anything to do with vandalism = strawman.  No one made that claim, least of all me.

&gt;the Wikipedia CTRL-C CTRL-V bollocks

Never once used Wikipedia - care to put it to a plagiarism test, or are you just spouting bollocks as seems your wont?  If anything does show up, which I doubt because my précising and paraphrasing skills are usually adequate (if I quote - I link), I'll take you directly to the sources Wikipedia stole them from (which are mostly the original texts).  Hey, I didn't _invent_ mutualism, I'm not claiming it's an original theory I just made up.  It's 150-400 years old mate - depending on who you ask.  Should a capitalist never refer to markets, private property, supply and demand etc.?

&gt;Banksy is your hero ? I guess that speaks volumes.

Nope.  Again you have problems with comprehension.  Neomantis quoted Banksy, I never mentioned him.  Though, I'm kind of neutral-positive on him.  I prefer to see his shit than corporate shit smeared over the cities' streets.

&gt;a wannabe anarchist

I get dreadfully tired of this expression, given that a far far larger group of people are wannabe capitalists, and their chances of success are no better.  I'm definitely a wannabe anarchist if you mean to imply that my deepest desire is for an anarchist society in my lifetime.  Not so much if you mean I'm a talker not a doer - that's the antithesis of anarchism.  On the other hand, if - in your imagination - anarchists are all spotty 16 year olds in balaclavas and masks throwing bricks at McDonalds, I imagine you'd be seriously disappointed at what I spend most of my time doing.

&gt;a Microsoft operating system while sipping your Starbucks coffee...if you hate corporations so much, then you aren't allowed to benefit from their products

Well, I could point out that - aside from my son who's a game addict - my house is Microsoft-free (and, being developing world Asia, his copy is a pirate copy too, no doubt), and that I've been to Starbucks precisely twice in my life (once in the US to find out what it was, and once in the UK because I was summonsed for an IT interview there).  But really, it doesn't matter.  We live in a capitalist prison, people resist as they can, but everyone has to live.  Where will you get product X from under global corporate capitalism except from a corporation?  It doesn't in the least mean only a corporation could provide it or that that is how you would rather obtain it.  We aren't free, so we live in our cages as best we can - do you equally ridicule a prisoner for eating prison food and sleeping on a prison bunk?

&gt;The idea that corporations are these magical beings is so blase

Who said they were magical? - I said they were creations of the State (""socialism"" if you like Mr. Capitalist! - In fact, the bureaucracies of most large transnational corporations look a lot like Soviet-era State-planning).  How exactly do you plan on forming corporations without States to incorporate them?  They're legal entities.

&gt;the people they employ and the people who put the money in to it DO have rights, and therefore by abusing corporate assets, you are abusing PEOPLE's assets at the same time. But I guess that's too complex a transition for you to make.

The people they employ/enslave, sure.  The people who invest in them are mostly - by numbers - fools - but by amount - capitalists.  Capitalists are pure parasites.  Lots of ""American dream"" bullshit in there about ""mom and pop"" stores, the very enterprises State-welfare-funded transnational corporations are driving to extinction. Don't think many buy that shit any more except the nompties on the US Tea Party side.

I'd disagree with that - there's a lot of difference in my eyes between the maturity level of a typical 16 year old, and an 18 year old.

My problem is the definition of an ""erotic pose"" - I don't know how well that can be enforced without more guidance. To me, the wording suggests that it is deliberately designed to be arousing (i.e. a shot in underwear from a striptease) - so not (as your original post seems to suggest) a Facebook profile pic.

&gt;It's double standards. ""Yeah, you can do this thing, but you can't watch other people doing it!""

It does seem a little hypocritical, but it serves a good purpose.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;I think the laws we have are pretty fair for basic crimes like vandalism.

I'm going to sound patronising whatever I say, so I'll just say it.  I'm guessing you've never really read much outside of the mainstream proprietarian literature, so of course it wouldn't cross your mind why vandalism might be justified, even moral, behaviour.  Which links to the second point:

&gt;Who the fuck is ""They""? What is their agenda? Use of the word ""they"" implies that there is a group of people working against ""me"", and that kind of phrasing really does make it sound like you're a nutter sharing a conspiracy theory. 

I could hit this in any number of ways, and I'm not sure which would be the most effective.  But given, your worldview has already relegated me to the role of conspiracy theorist, I might as well take on the role of Marxist too:

""The ideas of the ruling class are, in every age, the ruling ideas:  i.e., the class which is the dominant material force in society is at the same time its dominant intellectual force.  The class which has the means of production at its disposal, has control at the same time over the means of mental production""

&gt;This is why ""The ends justify the means"" is such a dangerous philosophy: 50% of the time it works, and it seems obvious to people why theft is justified to prevent mass murder. The problem is that the other 50% of the time not everybody agrees that the ends really do justify the means, for example most people would not say that mass murder justifies the prevention of theft. In general you need a better justification than utopia, because my utopia involves people respecting eachothers property but yours does not.

You're going to have to elaborate to me why you think your idea that ""most people would not say that mass murder justifies the prevention of theft"" is relevant to my point.  Is there a point of logic that I'm missing (it's late!)?

No real moments of brilliance to make you fall in love with him, at least not so far. But Frank has been all but sidelined in the UK version, as well, pretty much every episode focuses on the other characters; the show in it's current form is much more about the Maguires, Powells, and the Karibs than the Gallaghers; with practically none of the original cast left except for Frank and Carl.

Shameless US did this right from get go - we're introduced to the US version of the Maguires and the Gallaghers and the other relevant characters right at the start, and being able to work with the hindsight of the UK version, the story lines are much more compressed. A Shameless UK episode sort of picks one issue and wanders through it; the US version tells three or four stories at a time in each episode.

coup-plotting and restlessness in the security services and

Asad as a way of sending such signals, with appropriate

Something definitely needs to be done. I think at the very least we should implement a tag system. Not only would it help organize the content in this subreddit, it would make it easier for people to find the content they want to see and skip the stuff they don't. Also, it would benefit you mods by giving a clearer picture of the sort of content the community posts.

I suggest something like:

[Meme] - Covers the general meme category. Examples would be Advice Animals style pics, reaction gifs, etc. 

[Merch] - Merchandise. Stuff you bought, saw, received as a gift, etc. Examples would be stuff like ""I got a sonic screwdriver for my birthday"" ""I bought that exploding Tardis poster"" or ""My friend has a Tardis mug"", stuff like that.

[Photo] - Photos. Your photos, someone else's photos, official photos, stuff relating to DW and not merchandise. Examples: Photos of you guys/girls/nuchachos with cast members, production photos, publicity photos, stuff in the wild (Dalek on a rooftop! Tardis on the back of a truck!, stuff like that), etc.

[Art] - I'm thinking this should apply to 2 dimensional stuff. Drawings, paintings, doodles, etc., whether it's yours or someone else's.

[Craft] - Three-dimensional stuff. Things like cakes, models, painted shoes, Tardises, papercraft, etc.

[News] - News. Articles relating to DW, tweets, announcements, stuff like that.

[Video] - Videos. Clips of the show, interviews, panels, etc.

[Music] - Haven't really seen a whole lot of stuff in this category on here, but still good to have the tag to cover that base.

[Discussion] - Discussion threads.",0,1342632302,null,0,1342632639,0,c5fudgl,t3_wravh,t1_c5fudgl,t3_wravh,null,1429408039,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,tremens,null,null,"I really, really wish we'd at least *try*. I'm an American and I fucking love Inbetweeners; it's right up there as one of my favorite comedy series of all time. Every person I've ever shown it to has fallen in love with it, as well - same with Spaced, The IT Crowd, etc. A few weeks ago I was sitting around watching Skins when a buddy came over, about 20 minutes of sitting on the couch bullshitting and he asks what it was. When I told him Skins, he said ""What the fuck? This is *way*, *way* better than that bullshit on MTV. Let me borrow this."" He's since watched every episode I have and turned even more people on to it.

There are some shows that I love that flat out would *not* work here. Shameless is the biggest and most obvious example - That would not have flown at all in the States, so I'm glad we remade it; the US version is excellent in it's own rights; if you get a few episodes into it when they're more or less just rehashing the UK plotlines and it starts to go at it on it's own, it's actually pretty brilliant.

But the fucking Inbetweeners? I have a lot of trouble accepting that people wouldn't love that show if they actually saw it. It might not run well with the 13-18 year old crowd, but the twenties crowd that's a little smarter and more experienced would love it, I think.

EDIT: I should add that the network would have a lot to do with capturing the right demographic here. I picture The Inbetweeners on a network like FX, which airs It's Always Sunny, Wilfred, Louie, Archer, The League, etc - All brilliant American comedies (Wilfred was adapted from the Aus version, obviously, but I think that's another instance where the remake is actually better.)",0,1342632457,null,0,1342632782,0,c5fuf18,t3_wqzcp,t1_c5fuf18,t1_c5fovpg,null,1429408059,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Levy has spent essentially nothing for the last two years, including our year of CL money, presumably in preparation for a spree this summer.

Niko, Corluka, and Modric out will mean at least 45m in.  Moutinho, Hulk/Falcao (one of the two), Jan, Gylfi, and Lloris would combine for a cost of around 103 million if the high-end reported transfer prices are to be believed.  That's 58 million net.

true,sonneti,ni,Belfast,"I don't think they will disappear completely but there have already been a number of cut backs.  Basically because they are an easy target, without a job you're a 2nd class citizen, even though everyone knows there are not enough jobs for everyone to be employed at the same time.

My friend is 32 years old, recently made unemployed and was forced to claim job seekers allowance and housing benefit.  Because he is under 35 years old he will only receive enough housing benefit to live in shared accommodation.  

He lives in a very small flat on his own that costs £325 per month, electric &amp; gas probably cost another £30 per month.  His total job seekers and housing benefit only come to £340 per month.  So how is he supposed to eat?  Buy washing powder, soap, shower gel?  Simply put he can't.

The part time work he has found means he faces more cut backs to his benefits &amp; enough paper work and bullshit to mean its just not worth his time working that job.

He is in a contract for the next 4 months so can't leave his current flat until then, and after that he will be in shared accommodation which I know will be extremely difficult for him.  

So what happens when you can't pay your bills?  you can't afford to eat?  It is an extremely desperate time.  Crime will rise because there are no other options.  

If your choice is starve or steal, I know what I'd pick.

It will kill me to see him live up to the hype at another club, but I feel there is a much lower chance of that happening at LFC in a Tiki-Taka system.

Generally speaking, someone who is in Season 1 should expect a subreddit that is 5 season ahead to be full of spoilers and should tread exceedingly carefully.

true,Mr_Wolfgang_Beard,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;Four years?! It was a joke? How is it especially different from me making the same joke with my friends? It wasn't even a public event, it was a private one that most people couldn't see.

Well the way I heard it it was a public event and it was serious. It's irrelevant though, if you make a joke that looks like a crime and don't think far ahead enough to bring evidence that proves it was a joke then the police won't be on your side. The guy failed to prove that it was a joke so he was sent to prison, the court didn't believe it was a joke so neither will I. If you make a joke with your friends where you send emails about bombing london to eachother then you need to prove that you aren't serious to the police; I'm sorry that the justice system doesn't have mind readers to prove innocence or guilt, we just have to go on what the jury finds - and they will go for the most likely option.

I think that people who present a danger to soceity need to be removed from it. Murderers and rapists need to be kept away for obvious reasons. Thieves don't present a *violent* danger to society, but they present a danger to people's property wealth and wellbeing etc and tbh they need to be removed too. If we don't take away thieves who are likely to steal again, and then they *do* steal again, then we aren't protecting society are we?

WRT this guy that tried to organise a riot... well people that try to start a riot are dangerous aren't they. If I take away their internet they can still make calls to plan one, if I take away their phones they can still write letters, they can put up posters and speak to friends and spread the word. The only way to remove the threat is to remove them until we are certain they aren't a threat anymore.

Look at bus services around the UK (Outside of London.) Generally, you'd see one bus company manage to secure a monopoly on bus services, hike the prices up and cut service hours to save costs, please their own shareholders and leave people genuinely reliant on these transportation services disgruntled. I believe this strategy is why driving a car is still a viable choice.

One of my biggest complaints is this. London has a pretty decent system (where Transport for London runs services at a reasonable set cost to the customer and contracts companies to operate buses/tube services according to their terms.) Why the fuck has no other British city done this? I mean I'd fucking love to use an Oyster card outside of London to pay for a reasonably priced bus journey.

So, you've not travelled all over the US, then? No, thought not.

Oh, wait, you met *open minded travellers*? Hold the phone.

Every country has groups of people that represent both the best and worst of their nation. The people who travel are, on average, the better- they are open to new experiences and new cultures. If The Inbetweeners was shown to the entire French public I would bet a significant amount of money that most people would not identify with or or enjoy it.

I'm not saying that absolutely no Americans can identify with The Inbetweeners. The more open minded can. But a major television network doesn't succeed by targeting an audience that is both small and likely to discover shows via the internet anyway.

As far as your plan goes though - ""Lets vandalise all the billboards that the big evil corporations have rented so that society can realise how rubbish capitalism is."" - legitimacy doesn't jump out at me. Sounds a bit more like getting people riled up and causing trouble. I could be wrong, and you might have a kick ass moral justification you're just waiting to explain to me; but the first thing you said in response to criticism was *""Shall we talk about corporate entitlement? Corporate vandalism? Corporate theft? And sins far worse... I think I can live with a bit of street art in comparison. Don't confuse corporations with people; leave that to the American right.""* - or in other words ""I'm playing tit-for-tat and my tit is way smaller than their tat.""*

This is why I brought up the ends justify the means thing. You didn't jump up and give me a lecture about ""how vandalism isn't really morally objectional anymore and the opinion that it should be criminal is outdated"" or something similar, you just went for ""everybody knows corporations are evil so that makes it ok"". Those are telltale signs that the means don't really have any moral justification on their own, and if a plan relies heavily on the ends to justify the means then you're on a slippery slope because the ends might not be justifiable either.

I don't think your ends are justifiable because I don't believe there is a *""ruling class""*, and I think that such an idea is ludicrous.

Can get way higher if you've got any kind of specialist knowledge.

Finally, they all need to be microchipped and subsequently vaccinated against rabies, if you haven't had that done already. It's probably going to get pretty expensive for 3 of them :/

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Okay I went and asked the hardcore-est Whovian I know. Bringing in the outside help. Here's what he said to me about the Valeyard, my own notes in [].

The Time War is locked out of relative time by the Doctor, meaning that at a certain point all Daleks and Time Lords cease to exist, along with Gallifrey and Skaro. So at some relative point in time every Time Lord, Dalek, Gallifrey and Skaro just disappear, at around the relative time the Time War starts. Now I keep saying relative time because that's important.

Remember I mentioned ages ago that Time Lords stick to relative time - in that the Doctor and the Master always meet each other sequentially because they are both Time Lords. You said ""who enforces this rule?"" and I said ""presumably the Time Lords, which accounts as to why they are observers only"", paraphrasing us both of course [transduction barriers on Gallifrey do this].

Now, this could be a kind of interesting set up here - imagine if the Time Lords were not only fighting the Daleks but also enforcing the rule that they could only meet sequentially? Remember that woman who opposes Rassilon and is killed? I've always thought that was Romana, for some reason. So imagine if Rassilon is resurrected (or released from the Dark Tower [The Five Doctors]), to lead the Time Lords because he was always their War President. This could have been done at Romana's behest, but she remained on the council in order to keep both the Time Lords and the Daleks in check. So the Time War, which is difficult to fight because the Daleks and the Time Lords keep backtracking over each others timelines, is given a sense of order by Romana, not because she believes it is right, but more importantly because if the groups backtrack over each other's timelines too much they will literally change the course of history. I think the Time War was a fair war, because both sides were actually playing fair. Remember in Resurrection of the Daleks, the Doctor makes the point that not even the Daleks would leave a piece of advanced technology lying around in the past for fear of altering the timeline? I think both the Daleks and the Time Lords were playing fair in the Time War, and that their relative histories had to remain intact in order for the war to continue and end. So, with that established, once the time lock is in place, past Gallifrey and past Skaro remain where they are, but are off limits to the surviving Daleks and the Doctor because both are aware of the drastic consequences their actions would have if they went back to alter it.

Cue the tenth Doctor deciding he can do what he likes because he is Time Lord Victorius, until he realises he simply can't. Another building block to the creation of the Valeyard. When the Valeyard comes along he has no qualms at all about rewriting history, and so he is the only person mad enough to go back into his own relative history (though I suspect Rassilon was probably mad enough to as well, hence the reason Romana remained on the council, only to be killed).",0,1342640163,null,0,false,0,c5fwpcf,t3_wq6ts,t1_c5fwpcf,t3_wq6ts,null,1429409153,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Of the four jobs I've had since I graduated, I got two that way. (The third was announced on a mailing list; the fourth is my own business).

But you can't just blast out CVs with a generic covering letter to the HR department on the off-chance. That doesn't work, you get the sort of responses you've been seeing.

Why's that? Two reasons:

   1. Generic CVs and covering letters are painfully obvious, particularly to a seasoned HR person. You might just as well write them a letter saying ""I can't be fucked to find out anything about your company"".
   1. At any given point in time, lots of department managers are thinking ""You know, we could really do with another person here"". But before they can do that, they need to get approval from their manager (which may in itself be difficult), they need to ask HR to advertise, they need to drill through a stack of CVs and conduct interviews. And even when you've gone through this process (which is **SUPPOSED** to ensure you get decent staff), there's still a good chance you'll find that the person you've hired simply doesn't get on very well, they move on and you've got to start the whole process again. This is a miserable process that very few people really like doing, so generally speaking they usually put it off until such time as they really can't avoid it. Until someone finally says ""Right, let's do it"", the HR department doesn't even know that there may be a vacancy. So when they get your letter, they give you the brush off.

So how do you deal with this? You need to get organised:

   1. If you have an email address like ""mad_dave@mypants.com"", stop using it. Get a Hotmail or a GMail account if necessary, but make sure the email address is sensible. You are **not** going to put ""mad_dave@mypants.com"" on a covering letter.
   1. Set up a (sensible) voicemail greeting. There is a time and a place for fake celebrity or joke greetings, now isn't it.
   1. Put together a list of companies in your area that are likely to hire people to do the job you want to be doing. Particularly interesting is your local paper, which may well run a ""business"" section. Get this and read it - companies that are in there may well be expanding, and if they're expanding they may need more staff.
   1. Learn a bit more about this company. Find out what they do, make absolutely sure that they're very likely to have a need for people with your skills. If they don't, then you're wasting your time and theirs.
   1. Find out who is in charge of the department you'd be working in. Google will usually only get you senior management - which is okay in small businesses because there generally isn't a huge management structure - but less helpful with huge businesses. This isn't necessarily the end of the world, because huge businesses are more likely to have inflexible policies which force you to go via HR. If you can't get any joy via Google, ask your friends, family, anyone you can think of. If all else fails, call reception and try to blag getting the name of the person in charge of the department.
   1. Find some way to link your skills with what they're likely to need. Write to the person in charge of the department, addressing them by name and explicitly drawing attention to this link. You'll wind up with a letter that goes something like this:


Dear Mr. Jones,

I understand (from research/press reports) your company (does/has recently done/is interested in) X.

I have skills specific to X, and I'm looking for an entry level role doing it. 

I have (recent experience/recently graduated in) (work that is likely to be directly relevant to the business). This bit can be a whole paragraph, but **every word** must be directly relevant to their business.

I enclose my CV for your convenience. If you'd like to discuss this further, please call me on 01234 567890 or email dave@example.com.

Yours sincerely (Sincerely with ""Dear Mr. Jones"", Faithfully with ""Dear Sir"". Though you shouldn't be writing ""Dear Sir"" anyway...)

Attach a CV **which you have customised to the prospective employer**. Remove irrelevant details, put everything that's relevant right at the top. 

The classic CV goes ""name, secondary and higher education, all work experience, hobbies, references"". I don't like this for a number of reasons:

   1. It puts the most interesting information (work experience) some way down the page. Most employers want to know about your work experience and how you that's directly relevant to them; they don't care that you got a C in GCSE French five years ago.
   1. It forces your prospective employer to dig through the CV looking for tidbits and reading between the lines to figure out what might be interesting to them.

Personally, I prefer a more functional style of CV that works in roughly this order. I've found it to be much better at getting me interviews:

   1. Profile. A brief paragraph about yourself, including any specific skills you have that are relevant to the task in hand. This is where you put the alphabet soup of acronyms that are relevant to your industry. 
   1. Recent Achievements and Experience. A list of things you've recently done that are somehow relevant. These should be things that an employer can immediately see as being useful.
   1. Personal Attributes. Things about your personality that are relevant to the task in hand - team working, managerial skills, that sort of thing. Every attribute must be backed up with an example for how you've used it.
   1. Relevant experience. Jobs you've had.
   1. Qualifications.
   1. Hobbies and Interests.
   1. Ambitions.
   1. Other information: date of birth, driving license, nationality.

TBH there are as many different styles of CV as there are jobseekers, so take this guidance with as much salt as you think it needs.

Once you've done all this (phew!), send it directly to the appropriate manager. Post is actually not a bad way to go - most people don't get much interesting post these days, so when something lands on their desk it gets attention. If you're going to do this make sure you use decent paper and that your printer is generating beautiful output. Patchy printing is an excellent way to say ""I can't be bothered"". Use an A5 or an A4 envelope so the minimum amount of folding is needed, and hand-write the envelope in your best writing.

A couple of days later, call them up, speak directly to the person you wrote to. Confirm they got your letter and ask if you can meet for an informal chat. (Keyword here is ""informal chat"". Not ""Interview""). The informal chat is literally just to see if you like each other; if you don't then it's no big loss, if you do then there's an excellent chance they'll push it into a proper interview process. If you can't get through, keep trying until you've either got the informal chat or you've been told they're not interested.

I've found this sort of process to be far and away the most effective. But **even if you follow it to the letter, and in a reasonably strong economy**, you can still expect that a lot of managers you wrote to won't even take your phone call.

Those who do speak to you on the phone, the majority will give you a brush off with varying degrees of politeness.

Those who do agree to a brief chat, not all of them will progress to an interview and not every interview will progress to a job. This is **perfectly normal**, it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you. Don't take any of the rejections personally because they are not meant personally. ""No"" doesn't mean ""No, not ever"". It means ""No, not today. But maybe tomorrow"".

You usually hear stories after the transfer window closes about how much the manager was given to work with; for all we know Rodgers has been told he must sell Carroll for £x million before we can buy Dempsey. 

I don't see how an owner wouldn't adopt this method; it gives the fans greater insight and results in them being less frustrated when a signing doesn't occur. Nothing annoys me more than hearing the club wouldn't fork out an extra few million for a certain player (David Villa in the early Benitez days being a prime example).

true,Tescobum44,IE,ireland,I disagree. I know the job Mikel has in the team is as a holding midfield but I do think Ramires is well capable of doing this. Also we have Romeu and Essien there who can do that in rotation. Mickel is good at what he does. but so are a lot of other players. His problem is he is not great or particularly good at everything else. What use is his defense if he loses the ball five seconds later. I think Ramires could prove to be much better at what Mickel does while also doing what he is particularly good at. Lampard is a football brain.

I however, would have no problem with additional forethought put into the series. They don't have to only have one Doctor going at once. They could have a series based around a future incarnation, from a different director, and they could simply film things together that would help with future options such as regeneration and stuff.

The original title was:

I fail to see an expression of an opinion, it is a statement of three facts which are all corroborated by multiple sources:

1. The BBC has produced a dramatisation of the riots.
2. The court has censored the BBC via court order preventing the distribution of the documentary in any form.
3. The Judge, Court and ruling are *all* secret.

Honestly, I don't think they've thought through the forever regeneration thing more than when The Doctor mentioned in the Sarah Jane Adventures that he can regenerate forever. This was a direct contradiction, from Moffat, who pretty much said there isn't really any canon to the show. However, if you want a couple of in-canon options:

The Doctor Lies. Well, he might not be telling the whole truth. By setting the precedent that he lies, it's easy to retcon the regenerations thing. For instance, say Spielberg decides to direct the next phase of Who. He could revert the regenerations thing as a lie, and build a story that involves going to Jurassic Park to clone a Doctor egg and then steal his regenerations, thus creating The Master... wait... 

The possibility exists that along with the TARDIS, The Doctor stole the machine that gives him unlimited regenrations. 

There is the whole River Song theory, but I'm unconvinced. [spoiler](/s ""She isn't a Time Lord, she was just a weird space baby with some TARDIS regeneration energy. And she gave it all up to save The Doctor, so... "") 

LIke I said, I don't think there has been a lot of thought into this aspect of the show. Moffat is focusing on character building between stories, and this Doctor doesn't seem selfish enough to go on a long quest to collect more regenerations. I have a feeling they just said that he has unlimited ones to give them the freedom to not explain it any more and just continue the show, business as usual.

Actually no. His passing is quite good. His completion percentage in the league last season was 90.2%, which is better than any other CM in the squad, apart from Essien who had 91.2% completion, (this high percentage might be explained though in part by the fact that he played far less minutes than Mikel and thus attempted far fewer passes.) And those weren't all just short square lay off passes either. He completed 82 of 111 attempted long balls last season. CareFreeChronicles does a good recurring piece on Mikel and the brilliance of his passing, IIRC it's called 'Mikel's Sideways Pass no.[fill in the blank].' Of the CM players who saw consistent action in the Premier League last season Mikel was our best passer by at least 3 percentage points.

In addition to the very good defensive positioning sense that you mention, imo he is also quite good at winning and retaining possession of the ball within tight spaces, or while under pressure. I am always confused as to why people decry him for 'giving the ball away.'

true,gad_about,null,null,"First of all, a couple of assumptions, forgive me if I've misassumed: I assume you're coming here to study? And from using 'fall' I assume you're from the US?

I don't think you'll have any problem finding things to do. First off, if you're here to study, you'll be able to join any of the myriad of clubs and societies at the university: these are designed for folks to get to know each other, and cover pretty much every interest under the sun. There's a [list of these](http://oxforduni.groupspaces.com/groups/) and by having a quick browse you're sure to find something you like. (If you're coming to study at Brookes, there'll be a list on their website too).

Hopefully I may be able to correct a misapprehension, too - unlike many other places, pubs in the UK are not just places to go out and get drunk. It's perfectly normal/fine/acceptable to go to the pub with your mates and not drink… yes, of course there will be drinking there, and it depends on the establishment, but if you get a pleasant one it's just a nice place to spend some time with your friends. Think of it like a coffee shop that stays open late.

There are two mainstream cinemas in town and two more arty ones, as well as a big multiplex on the outskirts of the city. Being a studenty kind of place, all sorts of culture, concerts (many free!), and the live music scene is buzzing. Check the 'Whats on' sections of www.dailyinfo.co.uk for listings - note that also there are many more concerts and such once the students get back in October.

Bowling - there's a bowling alley on the outskirts of the city. It's not the nicest in the world though to be honest so possibly not worth taking the trip out there.

Outdoors stuff - what are you into? as well as joining a club/society at the university (there are many which are outdoors focussed), you only need to travel a short distance from the city to be in some of the most beautiful countryside. Yup, the south-east of England is relatively flat (no mountains etc) and is kind of squashed up (no vast areas where you can be 100 miles from the next person) but we manage to pack a lot of variety into a small place. If you like hiking, the Ridgeway is an ancient trail which is just a short hop (30 mins or so) from Oxford on the train, and gets pretty remote (especially in the western half). Or within a few (3 or so?) hours train ride/drive, you can be in the Welsh mountains, Peak District, Dartmoor, Lake District… all hilly mountainous places where you can easily get yourself lost (in a good way). The Scottish highlands are further but even more remote and spectacular. No poisonous creatures or bears in the backcountry in Britain, either! (it does rain a fair bit though!). Climbing - there's a great climbing wall at Brookes where you're sure to meet folks who you can tag along with on weekend trips. The coast is a couple of hours away. Mountain biking is possible at a bunch of places nearby.

And also, don't forget that London, with all its attractions and all its downsides too(!) is only an hour away on the train or 90 mins or so on the coach. Oxford's very centrally located so you're near enough to the buzz of London and also near enough to the peace and quiet of the countryside.

Let us know what you like doing and I'm sure the folks here will be able to suggest things for you. Socialising in the UK isn't *just* about drinking :)",0,1342650834,null,0,false,0,c5fzppi,t3_ws0ph,t1_c5fzppi,t3_ws0ph,null,1429410664,3,false,oxford,t5_2rc7b,3

I think that nearly every English family I know has a recent Irish link through marriage, and although that doesn't negate 'racism', it does suggest that the two peoples are at least getting along.

 I still had one question though: in ""Gridlock"", [multi spoiler](/s "" the face of bo gives his dying energy to save the world... and then apparently expires. BUT, in S1E2, Bo is present at the veiwing of the end of earth. But clearly, the happenings in new-new-new^11 New York were still on the earth itself, long before the explosion of the planet. So.... how did Bo survive to be at the end of the world? Does he never really die, even as a face? It seemed that after living a few million years, he had finally used up all his energy, and just passed away. But this seems to be a bit of a paradox. Correct me if I'm wrong...  "")

To answer your question, it looks like Gio is on his way out. He's training with Mexico's Olympic squad right now, so AVB hasn't had much of a chance to assess him. That said, he has a year left on his contract with Tottenham, and has stated that he would prefer to leave. Although he certainly would fit into AVB's tactics far more than he every would under Harry's, there are lots of question marks over his commitment to establishing himself in England. Lots of tabloid stories out there about being late to training, excessive drinking, etc. Unsure how much stock you'd want to place in those rumors, but he's often seemed quite uninterested in while playing in a Tottenham shirt (Europa league appearances last year, for instance). On the other hand, you'll find more than a handful of Spurs fans who say Gio hasn't been given a fair chance. It's tough for me to say, but AVB will have the final word and he hasn't even met Gio yet.

The little girl in the fairytail is not a little girl anymore, so she's pissed, and by the way she doesn't have parents, but nobody cares. Anyway, the little girl goes with that strange man, and together they have adventures and they fight Daleks, big space whales, robots that look like Daleks but aren't Daleks, well actually they are but you learn it at the very end, when they suddenly change colors, also the weeping angels come back, and the little girl still doesn't have parents and she still doesn't know why, oh and there's a crack in time that absorbs the statues, so they get out of there alive. River also tells the Doctor that a big box will open, that Silence will fall, that kind of stuff.
Then the box actually opens, and there's the Doctor in it, but then the Doctor comes out and the little girl comes in, then she gets married and the Doctor dies, but then he's alive again and we discover that the little girl didn't have parents because of the crack in her wall.

true,pcjonathan,smith,Smith,"1. I'll just clarify what I meant to you as well. I didn't mean doing a poll on whether to do it or not. More doing some research on it. For two reasons. 1) I don't think the minority is as large as it may be. (Happy to be proven wrong though). 2)If it doesn't apply to many, then it may not be worth the effort?

2. Exactly. I could totally understand the current season. Last season I could go with too but anything before that and I have to wonder if people truly care or just say they do. But then, like you say, the new fans are a complication.

3. I agree. It's a good idea at a first glance but it can turn into a pain. Especially considering New/Classic. Many posts also mention multiple stories. It may also annoy a fair few posters.

4. I think the enforcement will be a problem and probably the only problem. I'm not sure when the mods are online but posts are flooding in all the time and there are a lot of them to go through. I know it's simple but not all reports are currently being handled now. The repost rule for example. You guys may want some help.

5. Just out of curiosity, what's the opposition to link flair? Aside from the fact that it allows moderators to do it so users won't care as much about it. As for the ""spoilers in titles"" thing, well there shouldn't be any anyway.

(The ""cheap"" one, that is.)

My name is Jake Steward and I am from North Carolina.

I'm so glad to find this on reddit!
I have a passion for building things and a love for DW, I just decided one day to combine the two!

I'd love to hear some feedback about what you like about it, and what you think can be improved.
I'm not sure why this other seller is selling his for $500, but I think $25 is a good price, some of you were saying that might be too low? What would you recommend I sell them for?

And in terms of hanging them, I'd suggest getting a cheap hanging kit from Walmart or Home Depot or something, shouldnt be too hard.


Also also, I am open to more ideas for props like these that I could make and sell, so if you have anything from a favorite movie or tv show that you've always wanted to own, I'm your guy!

true,Prairie_Dog,cyberman,Cyberperson,"OK, first, SPOILERS!!!

If I remember correctly, The Master wanted to access the Eye of Harmony (or a direct link to it) which was located beneath the High Council Chamber in the Citadel on Galifrey. He had to access certain artifacts originally designed by Rassilon (his Key and Sash) to gain direct access to it. He planned to use the power of the Eye to accomplish his aims, but this would cause the destruction of the Citadel and Gallifrey. He was, of course, thwarted at the last moments by the Fourth Doctor. However, he did manage to escape in his TARDIS, which appeared as a grandfather clock (due to its functional chameleon circuit no doubt).

Wikipedia says the following about this section of the episode: ""The Doctor explains what he has deduced: that the Eye is actually the nucleus of a black hole, an inexhaustible energy source that Rassilon captured to power Gallifrey; the Sash and Key are its control devices. The Doctor deduces that the Master was planning to steal this energy to gain a new cycle of regenerations; however, if the Eye is disrupted, Gallifrey will be destroyed and a hundred other worlds will be consumed in a chain reaction.""

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;I don't believe there is a ""ruling class"", and I think that such an idea is ludicrous. There are people in power, and there are people who rule; but they certainly don't form a ""ruling class"" in any sense!

I'm not sure I entirely get what you're saying here, I presume that those who rule don't share sufficient interests to form a coherent class, or that there is a rotation of elites?  In the former case I partially dispute it, in the latter I agree - although they don't rotate anywhere nearly as rapidly as some who talk about meritocracy and class mobility would have you believe - whether you measure it over [200 years](http://www.econ.yale.edu/seminars/echist/eh11/clark-111024.pdf) or [1000](http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2011/Assets/ClarkFullPaper.pdf). Indeed, most of the land in the UK hasn't changed hands all that much since William's time, and it's a startling fact that [""69 per cent of the acreage of Britain is owned by 0.6 per cent of the population. Or, more pertinently, 158,000 families own 41 million acres of land, while 24 million families live on the four million acres of the urban plot](http://www.newstatesman.com/society/2010/10/land-tax-labour-britain).

But on the ruling agenda, and their ability to implement it, of course there are factions and conflicts, even classic old fashioned Marxism recognised that.  What was the shift from feudalism, through mercantilism, to modern industrial capitalism if it didn't reflect this? Old money gave way to new, the power of the church to the secular State, and that of the landowner to the factory owner.  The Tories fell and the Whigs rose, and subsequently the Tories took over representing the interests of industrial capital against organised labour. Indeed, since Wilson's government turned loose the City, through the second half of the last century, we've broadly seen schism, conflict and victory by financial capitalism over industrial capitalism.

Appealing though Hanlon's razor is, and I don't doubt cock ups of every sort abound, and unattractive as I find Marx's and - particularly Engels' - economic determinism (to the extent that it's a fair representation of their arguments, so not very far), it's reasonable to look at the general thrust of history as beneficial to the interests of certain social groups and against the interests of others, and these trends are not adequately explained by coincidence, they don't just happen stochastically.  Michael Parenti [puts it best](http://books.google.com.vn/books?id=XGBrLo4WbJ8C&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=Almost+as+an+article+of+faith,+some+individuals+believe+that+conspiracies+are+either+kooky+fantasies+or+unimportant+aberrations.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X7mja96hxB&amp;sig=iMRpqEILciKkyev1Hc5qpBsNnug&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1GcHULmhI4qtiAezr4HzAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Almost%20as%20an%20article%20of%20faith%2C%20some%20individuals%20believe%20that%20conspiracies%20are%20either%20kooky%20fantasies%20or%20unimportant%20aberrations.&amp;f=false).

true,ghostridethewhip,null,null,"My thoughts on the first half:

* Hazard's acceleration and change of direction are simply unparalleled. When he wants to turn and go, the Cristiano Ronaldo bells go off in my mind. He has that level of pace and electricity, and there aren't many players who can warrant that comparison without cuing the laugh track.

* Marin looks fantastic on the left flank at cutting in field (almost Robben-esque, minus the tight jersey), and he is actually looking great with defensive help/chance creation as well. My worry is that he does not look up much. His eyes are glued on the ball, and that caused him to miss a few assist opportunities in addition to those that he took.

* Lukaku looked confident in front of goal and finished well, but he looked pretty poor aside from that. Very bad at holding up the ball, and not great  at decision-making with the ball at his feet. On the plus side, he has certainly improved from early last season. Just has a long way to go before I feel comfortable with him leading the line.

* Chalobah is skilled, but tactically lost. Like Lukaku, he is super young, and I'm not worried by any means. This is great experience for them both.

* McEachran had an excellent tackle and assist for Lukaku's first. Shame he bungled it with the assist to Montero. I'm going to place a bit of the blame for that on Ivanovic for not leading the defense and hoofing it out of bounds in the first place, but poor play from McEachran and he knew it. Otherwise a solid half from him.

* All of the rest of the regulars look decent, if a bit rusty (for obvious reasons). I'm just happy to see us in action!",0,1342665113,null,0,1342665241,0,c5g351i,t3_ws943,t1_c5g351i,t3_ws943,null,1429412340,19,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,19

true,ghostridethewhip,null,null,"Second half thoughts:

* Kevin de Bruyne's workrate on the attack and on defense was eye-opening. He was running all over the pitch, constantly harrassing the man on the ball, and he won the ball back a handful of times in dangerous areas high up the pitch. Great link-up play with the midfield and attack as well. He's not as pacy as I thought he was (I think playing in the Belgian league makes him look faster than he really is), but still a solid performance from him.

* Pleased to see Hutchinson storming up and down the pitch and begging for the ball. It has to put a smile on your face as a Chelsea fan to see him out on the pitch having fun. I never thought I would see it happen again after the injuries he's had.

* Speaking of serious injuries: Ivanovic scared me to death with the slide tackle when he screamed. I thought he broke his leg. Woosah. Time to change the pants.

* Also speaking of serious injuries, Essien looked strangely mobile today. I'll be curious to see if that was an anomaly or if he got back into top shape in the offseason. He was far less gimpy than I remember him being just a few months ago. God, I would love to have The Bison back at full strength.

* Kakuta tried to pull a Sturridge today and failed in my book. Last season, I am convinced that 100% of the reason why Sturridge got so much playing time under AVB is because he was uber-selfish in the pre-season in Asia. He scored a handful of goals, caught AVB's eye, and the selfish goal-scoring record continued into the season (for better or worse). Kakuta tried to put a move on his man and go it alone every time he touched it today, but no such luck for him. He tried a few through balls towards the end, but those didn't work either. Curious to see if that trend continues in the next few pre-season matches.

* The rest of the youngsters were solid if unremarkable. Glad they got some playing time, and I don't think any of them looked out of place with our first team players. The one young player that surprised me big time was Lucas Piazon. Not because of his skill or anything (I know he's a great player and prospect), but because of where he was positioned as a lone forward. I thought he was more of a winger/support striker, so it was strange to see him as a lone forward. I don't think he has enough size/ball retention ability to play as a lone forward, but what do I know.",0,1342668641,null,0,false,0,c5g401z,t3_ws943,t1_c5g401z,t3_ws943,null,1429412741,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

Remember what the 10th Doctor (David Tennant) said about regeneration: “Even if I change, it feels like dying. Some new man goes sauntering away, and I’m dead.” This explains why each incarnation of the Doctor has been reluctant to die. It turns out that, from the Time Lord’s point of view, each version of the Doctor is snuffed out. His memories live on, but his persona is lost. Each new incarnation has both a completely new appearance and a new personality, making each version of the Doctor a new man. That previous version is dead.

Assuming that he regenerates at all. The Fifth Doctor (Peter Davison) noted that there is always a chance something will go wrong; he wasn’t certain he would regenerate after being poisoned.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"I'm just going to jump in here pre-emptively since I'm sure the topic will come up. 

Firstly, Dempsey is not a superstar and he is not expected to come in as a superstar. If he does come, it will be to contribute as a strong squad player, not someone for the team to rely on. So don't argue that he's not a superstar, nobody says he is. 

Next, Dempsey will not be bought for the future. He will be bought for immediate impact over the next 2 or 3 seasons. He is also incredibly fit. 29 years of age is not an issue. 

For the ~~American~~ over-enthusiastic fans amongst us, please do not overhype Dempsey. He is good, maybe even very good, but he is obviously not a superstar. I understand why you like him, some for footballing reasons and others for patriotic reasons. But please don't overrate him. 

Also, buying Dempsey doesn't guarantee Carroll's departure. Buying Dempsey helps shore up the holes in the squad. With the departure of both Kuyt and Maxi, and the possible departure of Bellamy, the left side is now almost as weak as the right. Dempsey, if he is brought in, will be brought in to replace Maxi and possibly Bellamy. 

Since we're on the topic of Carroll, Rodgers will decide whether he is suitable for the squad. He will likely make this decision **AFTER** seeing Carroll in training. Saying things like ""If Rodgers fails to fit Carroll into the squad I will lose my head"" or ""I will be very disappointed if Rodgers makes us lose all that money on Carroll"" does not help. Consider the possibility that Carroll might be the one who disappoints Rodgers, not the other way round. 

tl;dr: **Calm down, and carry on.**

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"Well, the big reason why The Doctor is reluctant to die is that he only has the ability to regenerate 12 times, leaving him 13 possible incarnations. So if he jumped off a bridge 13 times, he would die permanently. So while acting a bit reckless at times, if he acts too reckless then he'll eventually die for real. There are also certain situations in which he can die, despite having regenerations left. If both his hearts stop, suffocates to death, or if his regeneration is interrupted are just a few.

As for the episode, I think the obvious has already been stated: RTD wanted to pander to the audience, and get as many tears rolling as possible. I think it was also a bit of an ego thing. He wanted to make *his* impression on the world of Doctor Who, and he wanted to cement it by depicting Tennant as a different person than any other Doctor. So when people think,""David Tennant was MY Doctor,"" it's accompanied with the thought that no other Doctor is like him. That he's different in every aspect, and that anyone after him isn't even the same person.

As for my own head canon rationalization, I've decided that it comes down to The Doctor just being severely mentally disturbed at the time, from stress and anxiety. So much that he had convinced himself of entirely irrational thoughts, such as the idea that he would die when he regenerated. A thought stemmed in paranoia due to anxiety. You'd be surprised the kind of things that you can convince yourself of when you're knee deep in anxiety.

As a side note, I've always hated the 'Another man saunters off' quote, not just because it goes against everything that has ever been stated about regeneration, but it's just not possible to even know that. If 10 really is a unique individual, distinct from any other incarnation entirely, then he wouldn't even know the repercussions of regenerating, as he hasn't been through it.

Think of it like this, imagine I make a cloning machine that clones somebody right down to their very memories. A perfect sci-fi cloning device. Now I get somebody, put them in my machine, and begin the process. What I don't tell them is after the body has retrieved their genetic and memory information, the machine kills the subject before cloning. The clone walks out, I tell him the experiment was a failure, and because he has all of the memories up until the original's death, he would believe that he is still the original.

Same thing would apply here. The Doctor would have no memory of his past selves dying, because the new incarnations would all believe they are the real deal, having retained all of the memories from the previous incarnations.",0,1342679921,null,0,false,0,c5g6f7d,t3_wsruh,t1_c5g6f7d,t1_c5g4u1t,null,1429413942,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,Bennie300,null,null,"Do you or people think he is already better than Savic? This is from the players Wiki:

&gt; Throughout centre back Vincent Kompany's four-match ban from 11 to 25 January, Savić replaced Kompany as City's starting XI defender **in the left centre back position**, with third-choice Kolo Touré away on international duty with Côte d'Ivoire in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations. Although Savić showed brief flashes of form in this time, he showed many instances of **nervousness** resulting **in frequent misplaced passes**, clearances, and crucially conceded a penalty against Liverpool in a League Cup match, resulting in a Liverpool win at home.[9] He even gifted the equalising goal via a poor first touch to Jermain Defoe in City's very close 3–2 win over Tottenham Hotspur at home.[10] With Kompany's return to the starting team, Savić returned to the bench.

Everybody reps Rekik showing great composure (some mention him playing as a 30 year old) and Rekik is left legged whereas Savic is right legged. For left center position that is an advantage. Mancini called him a player in the mold of Baresi, meaning he is a footballing defender. Is able to go for the footballing solution and can build up.  

I'm curious what he plans to do this year. Go on a loan or tries to compete with other defenders, for example Savic. If he goes on a loan, will it be a Championship club or an EPL club? Last period of previous season he was at Pompey and was already pretty good there. Don't know if another whole year in a lower division will be the best development option.

true,Leonichol,cnty-uk,Geordie in exile (Surrey),"Really, monitoring **where** you go online is no huge step forward from monitoring who you call. Which is already done without too much outcry. However the bill does go further than that. Of said communications, in the bill itself it does a lot more than the BBC has reported, it is not exclusively social media, email, etc... but pretty much everything, everywhere, all the time. The bill does not seem to make any provision for storing data content, which I am sure is a relief to ISPs.

I am really not sure what the hoohar about a centralised system is. If each segment is searchable through a 'filter' or a 'search engine' then what is the difference? Not that it matters. They are tracking this information... they will get to it if they want it one way or another. How easily accessible it is is small fish concerning only the technical ability of smaller government departments and the ease of tracking people who move between different subscriber systems. Imho, what it is doing in the first place, is the big fish.

How much it will actually prevent crime, is another matter. No one doing criminal activities with any degree of professionalism is going to allow themselves to be tracked this way. They will either hitch on someone elses connection, or use a VPN.

Interesting that the HMRC get to play with this though, lol.

Now the technical issue I forsee is the bills requirement to log 'traffic data', which of course, is loosely defined in several subsections. But largely concerns being able to identify a person and the type of message. This of course, is easy to do with something such as DNS monitoring if all you are doing is accessing a website, or looking at email headers for SMTP/POP. But for my posting here right now, they would have to actually monitor my TCP communications, and design something specifically for reading packets to and from Reddit. How the hell do they envision doing that for every website? There, is just no way.

To make a non-technical analogy. Imagine you make a phone call (logged) to someone (also logged). Now you have a nice chatter with each other (not logged). However during the call you tell the person, please pass a message onto Simon tomorrow that there is no scones for the tea. This bill, requires that we log the fact that we passed a message on to Simon, and who was involved. Then we search Simons records to see if he received it, and who he passed subsequent messages on to. You would have to monitor phone calls for this, and understand the content being delivered. In every language, dialect, coded form, etc. Not possible. (For the technical amongst you, that was the difference between TCP establishment and telling where a social media post came from and was aimed at).

So do not be concerned people. Yes your web requests will be monitored as this technology is well established. But no one has the processing capability to monitor what they actually intend to do :).",0,1342690117,null,0,1342691395,0,c5g7s94,t3_wt3ub,t1_c5g7s94,t3_wt3ub,null,1429414571,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

3 were made [Lahm, Gomez, Neuer],
2 were saved [Robben (Extra Time), Olic],
1 was missed [Schweinsteiger]

Furthermore, of those six, he ""guessed"" the right way on all six, putting his hand on four of them. Not only is he a hero for that performance, but the preparation he had knowing where those six players had gone with their penalties in the past shows his dedication and passion to the club.

At the moment the ""direct"" players we have up front/on the wings consists of Marin and Sturridge (who of course hates playing on the wing). Getting Moses in gives us that option in case we need it and at, I think, a much more reasonable price than that Porto are asking for Hulk.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"He will. That's not what most fans think, but is just a popular fan theory around here that has no reasonable backing from the show, or any other media. It was fairly well established from events in Classic Who that the limit is biological, and is even backed up in New Who(River Song giving up all of her regenerations to save The Doctor). It's also just not reasonable, and makes no sense, for the high council to 'police' regeneration limits. It would also entirely defeat the purpose, as renegade Time Lords like The Doctor could just ignore it entirely, as they're so far removed from Time Lord society. And most, the high council *did* have the knowledge/technology to grant extra regeneration cycles, but they had no direct power over people's regenerations. In fact their absence doesn't mean The Doctor doesn't have to worry about regeneration limits, because he does now more than ever. The only people in the universe who could grant him an extra cycle are dead, and erased from time.

And, if that's not good enough for you, Moffat has said in interviews that the writers will figure out a way around the regeneration limit when The Doctor gets to that point in his life. So it's still there, and is still considered to be there by Moffat. A lot of this 'The Time Lord society dictated regeneration limits' nonsense is just people trying to figure out a solution to a problem that hasn't arisen yet, which is how The Doctor will circumvent the regeneration limit.

On a personal note, I don't know why so many people are adement about the idea that there is no regeneration limit. Aside from the fact that it contradicts everything we know about regeneration cycles, it just wouldn't make for good storytelling. Without a new cycle of regenerations, The Doctor will have to actually live out his final days until he figures out a new way to get a new cycle. No being clever, no Tesselecta, no magic Jesus powers. Ultimate death, unless he can do something drastic to save himself, potentially something harmful and selfish. Possibly even undoing the Time Lock so he can selfishly live to see another day. The possibilities are rich and numerous. If it's the case that he just magically has unlimited regenerations now, then there won't be any story whatsoever. He'll just regenerate and be about his day. All kinds of potential stories that have been building up for 50 years over his regeneration limit will just vanish in a puff of smoke.

Dempsey also gives us an aerial option so, if he replaces Carroll, you can use the Plan B of sending crosses in without it undermining Plan A.  I can see Stevie whipping in crosses with Dempsey making the challenge and Borini cleaning up anything that makes it's way through to the back post.  He and Borini like the play coming in off the left so really my only concern is that we will shift pretty heavily to that side.  That might open up space for Stevie to fill the wing, though.  Those three together give, as Rafa loved to say, ""options.""

Also, he's 29 but American players log a lot less playing miles early in their life/career so it will be interesting to see how Americans age as more of them make their careers in Europe.",0,1342692837,null,0,1342707568,0,c5g816h,t3_wsxqx,t1_c5g816h,t3_wsxqx,null,1429414688,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

true,gadget_uk,eng-warwickshire,Warwickshire,"&gt; Right-thinking Christians are in the business of truth, and this means being supporters of science, not opponents. Christians through the centuries have been at the forefront of scientific discovery, and it is only a small fringe group which emerged very recently that has taken a distorted view of Biblical literalism. Biblical scholars down the ages have taught that the Bible contains poetry and allegory as well as history and biography.

&gt; Apparently this makes Mouse a creationist.

See, this really annoys me. This sort of ""hey, I'm a Christian and I'm not ramming creationist nonsense down everyone's throat - therefore it's not happening"" rubbish. It **is** happening at an every growing rate, mainly in the US but I can see an emerging lunatic fringe in this country too. We're not bothered about ""right thinking Christians"", anyone prepared to engage in sensible debate about these issues, regardless of their beliefs, is fine by me. It's the nutters, the bonkers literalists and they are starting to push their insane agenda into schools. I'm sorry if everyday Christians are offended by the secular community ranting about this, but I'm damned if I'm going to turn a blind eye now then have a much bigger problem - with momentum on its side - in a few years time.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"Well, this is just me, but I'd love to see some good moral internal conflict with The Doctor. During the RTD era it always felt like we got teased, but ultimately RTD chickened out of these big moments. So the next time one gets brought up, I'd love to see the actual moral dilemma.

My big example, biggest it was quite possibly my biggest let down, was during The End of Time in which The Doctor 'has' to use a gun to save the planet from being taken over by Gallifrey. RTD built up this huge concept about how The Doctor hates, and detests, guns of any sort. Spanning from just abou the beginning, and culminating during The End of Time in which Wilfred insists that The Doctor takes his gun for protection.

So, the big dilemma, what does that man who detests guns do when he is forced to use one to save the whole of creation? Which does he shoot, Rasillon, the great founder of the Time Lords, or his old friend and school mate, The Master? Does he shoot the person that, by dying, could stop the entire situation, or do you spare him to shoot the big man in charge and usurp his command? What do you do...what do...oh, wait, nevermind...you just shot at the device controlling Galiifrey, and send it back into the void.

To me this felt like a major copout considering how much time had put into the idea of The Doctor hating guns during RTD's run. Like it all eventually fell to nothing, because the moment he *had* to use the gun, he didn't really use it at all. There was never any real internal conflict with the character, because the answer all along was to just shoot the machine that was bringing Gallifrey back into existence.

Moffat has already shown a lot of hints at the internal struggles of The Doctor, and I'm personally hoping he doesn't let me down like RTD does. Now I'm not saying that The Doctor needs to entirely change, or do something drastic. I wouldn't have even cared about the whole gun thing if RTD hadn't put so much emphasis on the fact that The Doctor didn't like guns. But if you're going to build up to some dramatic moment in which The Doctor must ultimately struggle with his own inner demos, his own convictions versus his will to stay alive, whatever it may be, I want to see a decent payoff of it. Not completely sidestepping the issue, and I can see The Doctor have to face these demons head on.

It doesn't even have to be that big. Maybe The Doctor finds some civilization in which they have perfected regeneration, themselves. We've seen in both New Who and Classic Who that The Doctor thinks people shouldn't try and prolong their species' lives(Although I never quite understood this, considering his very nature). So perhaps we see him convince the people to let him use the technology/machine, and then immediately destroy it afterwards, claiming to species should have that kind of power. Then have the rest of the story kind of revolve around his decision to do this, and he has to confront the dying people of the planet, and feel like crap as he explains that he feels the ability to play god, and decide what creatures do or don't get to use technology that they themselves have developed.

Well, at least that's my little ramblings on the possibilites :p.",0,1342696977,null,0,false,0,c5g8f8i,t3_wsruh,t1_c5g8f8i,t1_c5g8ash,null,1429414881,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I did read the whole article (even the hilarious/offensive comments after it) and, as I said in my original comment, I am not going to keep quiet about this issue until it becomes too late to do anything about it. It *may* be a storm in a teacup today but it needs *addressing* for the rubbish it is today. After all, the people teaching it - whatever class they are in - clearly *believe* it, which has a huge impact on the students.

The schools have very carefully positioned their creationist stance as one of theological significance - i.e. not scientific. I also note that one school changed their position on this before being granted the ""free school"" status. That worries me. Clearly what they believe is creationism, but they're saying ""we won't teach this now that we've been told we shouldn't"". 

For now, they are all erring towards the ""god of the gaps"" position where the last unexplainable tenet of science (pre big-bang and the few milliseconds after it) *might* be down to God - and everything after it can therefore be deemed part of ""his plan"". They know that science can't disprove that at this time. What they won't explain to the class is that every other ""god did it"" theory that has been tested and explained by science so far has been proven to be... not god. It also leads to an interesting discussion about why a god that did one thing billions of years ago is so interested in us specifically, how often we ""sin"" and whether or not we worship him. That's a sound theological debate and I encourage every school to have it - in RE.

I'm all for ""teaching the controversy"" as far as it goes - but there is no longer any controversy. it was a historical controversy that will make the last hundred years of mankind seem a little bit stupid when future generations look back at it.

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","Part 2: You've got the informal chat, now what?

Most of this is appropriate to every interview stage; none of it's specific to your informal chat.

All that work you put in earlier has finally paid off and you've organised an informal chat with someone who may be helpful.

Great! But you're a long way from having a job yet, so don't get too excited.

There's a few things you still need to do, and you need to get started NOW.  There's nothing worse than getting this far then not being properly prepared. But that won't happen to you because you're going to prepare properly.

So, get out a pad of paper or fire up your word processor and start preparing notes.

Find out as much as you sensibly can about the company. There's no need to get stalker-type levels of detail but at a bare minimum you should know:

   1. What the company does.
   1. How long they've been doing it. 
   1. Why the company reckons they're different to their competitors.
   1. How much they turned over last year.
   1. Any recent projects they've carried out that were in some way newsworthy, particularly if those projects are relevant to the department you'd be working in.

You should already have done most of this when you prepared your initial approach, so there shouldn't be much more to do.

Once you've got all this written down in a condensed form, go over it until you know it back to front. By all means keep notes to take into any formal interview process but if you have to read from them all the time, you'll look like your mum did your homework for you and you don't have a clue what it says.


**Getting There**

Make absolutely certain you know where you're meeting for this informal chat - and, for that matter, any future interviews.

If you've not been there before, go a day or so beforehand at about the same time as the chat is scheduled for. Work out precisely how long it takes to get there; if you'll be driving then figure out where you can reliably park the car. If you'll be using public transport, try and arrange to take a bus or train at least one earlier than the latest one you can - much better to arrive an hour early and mooch around for an hour than it is to find the train you were depending on has been cancelled and there is now no way you can hope to get there on time.


**Appearances are important**

Dress for the job you want, not the not-washed-in-three-days T-shirt you wear for slobbing around the house.  It's always better to over-dress for these situations than it is to under-dress. As a bare minimum you must have a smart shirt (not the sort of shirt you go out for a night on the booze in, the two are quite different), clean trousers, clean black formal shoes and a tie with a moderately conservative design. It's okay for the tie to be colourful, but your Daffy Duck tie is not really ideal.

Find formal shoes you can comfortably wear all day. They do exist, but they can be rather harder to find than comfortable trainers. Don't buy a pair thinking ""they're a bit uncomfortable now but they'll be fine after breaking in""; many modern shoes are designed in such a fashion that they can't really be broken in very well. Try and find somewhere that's actually interested in selling you shoes you can wear; the likes of Clarks have mostly become box-shifting type places that are only interested in taking your money and pushing you out the door. I've found my local John Lewis to be helpful here; obviously YMMV.

Polish your shoes the day before using real shoe polish of the sort that comes in tins. Liquid polish tends to lose its shine rather more quickly.

Make sure you deal with any lingering hygiene issues before you meet your prospective employer. Shower, wash your hair and sort out any visible issues like dandruff. Don't eat anything that's likely to disagree with you the night before - nobody wants to sit in an enclosed space with someone who can't stop farting. 


**Questions - and how to deal with them**

Think of this as more of a date than an interview. You're not trying for a job, you're trying to see if you like each other. It's perfectly natural to come out of it thinking ""Jesus H. Christ, that man was the biggest tosser I've ever met. I'm buggered if I'm working with him"". Hopefully you won't have any interviews like that, but I must confess I've withdrawn from the job application process on a number of occasions.

There's all sorts of books giving lists of typical interview questions and suggesting model answers. The problem with any of these is that you'll dedicate all your time to memorising ""101 great interview answers!"" then your interviewer will hit you with question number 102. Much better to be prepared in a more general sense - ensure you know who you're talking to, why you want to work for them and why they should hire you.


**Confidence**

Carroll doesn't fit Rodgers style of play, Rodgers has had numerous direct opportunities with the media to re-assure the fans of Carrolls long term future at Anfield, he hasn't.  Spain play the same style of football as Rodgers intends to, they didn't even start a centre-forward and Torres is far more adept at passing and movement than Carroll is, so is Pedro for that matter; and they played some of the best football in history in the final, you think Rodgers looked at that and said ""no i need to keep this oldschool centre forward"" or do you think it reinforced his belief it isn't needed.

I will be somewhat disappointed if Carroll leaves (i think he is a good player, but i accept if he isn't being used 20M in the bank is better than 35M in the squad), shocked? not even close.  I fail to see what will be shocking.  You can't even suggest the money loss is shocking, we paid 35 million because they got 50 million for Torres, whatever Newcastle asked above what Liverpool were prepared to pay (20M) they asked Chelsea for that amount extra for Torres, they essentially spent Chelsea's money, so even if we take a 15million hit selling him, whilst its bad, they will know the 15million extra came from Chelsea and we never had it to begin with.

Harwood was nonetheless able to join another force, Surrey, before returning to serve with the Met in 2005.

In the book, The system works by three visions of potential futures being averaged together by a computer, so if the average says that a crime will be committed, it probably will be and it'll be acted upon, and vice-versa.  Anderton's position only occurs because he gets one vision with Murder, one with No Murder, and one that says Murder, but could only occur if *it itself* comes out as Murder and combines with the others to average Murder and is seen by Anderton.  That's kind of a positive paradox, so the average comes out as murder.  Other than that very particular situation (i.e., the person is influenced by the prediction itself), it was a flawless system.

In the film, it turns out that the system is flawed, in that despite the fact it's right a lot of the time, it can be, and is tricked into showing a prediction that will not happen, and the precogs will ""disagree"" with each other.  Because of this Anderton is framed, and the act of being framed leads him to *almost* commit the crime he was framed with, with the idea that these disagreements were being flushed in order to hide the imperfections inherent within the system.  The system is then destroyed because of the ending of the film, with clear defiance of the prediction (and some sort of bollocks about free will vs destiny or something).",0,1342706877,null,0,false,0,c5g9wne,t3_wt5cw,t1_c5g9wne,t1_c5g93wo,null,1429415579,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Yes, they have a mobile phone. But that's an ongoing cost and like alexgmcm said, a PAYG phone is very very cheap to run and even a phone that's a few years old can be a smartphone - I run one myself and it costs me practically nothing.

People will acquire things that society tells us are essentials (and as a result are essential in our society) when they have enough money to do so - A phone is an essential for finding and keeping employment in many cases. So is reasonable clothing, an internet connection. Other things such as a TV or a console for entertainment are items which are considered purchases and again are bought when said household has the amenities to do so. To sell them to be able to afford to eat is an act of desperation. It doesn't help solve the long term problem, only the immediate one. The same household may still not be able to eat one week next month, and then they have no TV or form of entertainment, and it would cost them even more to replace it. Its just so much better to keep a hold of these items while a financial emergency seems temporary.

I would never look at my finances and say 'well i cant afford to eat this week, I better cancel my internet, sell my phone and PC'. I know NOT having those things will put me in a much worse position for finding employment or having a connection to society (I am a freelance illustrator- my PC and internet is absolutely ESSENTIAL). If a person can't afford to eat its usually a temporary problem caused by unexpected outgoings.

- the second time was in London, I begged  to meet him again... Frank had scored against Bolton and we were the Champions of England for the first time since the invention of colour TV. This time he did most of the talking (Dan translated). At this point I was convinced that CFC was not a play thing for an oligarch; but rather a passion.

- the third time was rather different since I was in Copenhagen and it was he who requested to have a chat. His son was meeting my ex's dad about a possible investment in FCK. I was not savvy to any of the details, so 
we talked about CFC.

Thanks to a good Russian friend, I know for a fact that Roman cares for the club, the fans, football and his kids. Roman is a good guy who actually loves CFC and should be treated like so.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Ian_Tomlinson#.281_April.29_First_police_statement

(notice the date..)

**Fact/Lie2: The police blamed the protesters for his death :-**

They said  on 2 April that, ""police were bombarded with bricks, bottles and planks of wood"" as they tried to save Tomlinson, forced by a barrage of missiles to carry him to a safe location to give him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation""

This was refuted by eyewitnesses 

' it was protesters, not police, who provided the initial first aid and telephoned for medical help.[69] Witnesses said that one or two plastic bottles were thrown by people who were unaware of Tomlinson's situation, but other protesters told them to stop.[70] The Times wrote that an analysis of television footage and photographs showed just one bottle, probably plastic, being thrown.] Video taken by eyewitness Nabeela Zahir, published by The Guardian on 9 April, shows one protester shouting, ""There is someone hurt here. Back the fuck up."" Another voice in the crowd says, ""There's someone hurt. Don't throw anything.'

**Fact/Lie3: CCTV cameras**

The police initially pretended there were absolutely no CCTV cameras in the area (must be the ONLY place in central London where there aren''t any) - when the videos + pictures were shown by the Guardian (god bless that newspaper) showing cameras were in fact in the area. (the police are either TOTAL FUCKING LIARS OR JUST UTTER CLUELESS)
 
**Fact/Lie4: autopsies**

Initially the police tried to fake the autopsy - autopsies after showed that the initial one was completely bungled.

The police murdered him - its quite simple.

Let's take Charlie Adam for example, he has far less experience in the Premier League, boasts far less success than Dempsey in the Premier League, and most would probably agree that Adam isn't as fit as Dempsey.

Adam was had for 7m pounds and the media are claiming that Dempsey - who has a more impressive CV than Adam - can be had for 10m pounds (give or take)?

I disagree. Kuyt was pretty prolific at times as well. He hardly played as a striker once Torres joined, but he had a respectable 14 goals in his debut season. 

I don't like comparing players based on goals, and I always use the example of Kevin Phillips. For someone who won the Golden Ball, nobody ever thought of him as an exceptionally good player. It is fairly common for players to score the bulk of goals when playing for poorer teams, because they have lesser teammates who are able to score. Darren Bent is another good example.

Don't get me wrong, that is part of law enforcement and it should be. However, this behaviour in real life would have to have suspicion, the police cannot just follow someone around for no reason.

But this system and the monitoring of the telephones is not this. They are monitoring people (everyone) without suspicion and it should be god damn illegal. Everyone is essentially tarred as a criminal for no reason.

You should only be ""tracking"" people on and offline with this suspicion of being a criminal. It isn't even a particularly difficult system since the hardware and software is already in place doing it to everyone.

You really need to haves look at the Project For A New American Century document (PNAC) which states the need for for multi-regional wars by America to maintain hegemony in the Middle East. The likes of Dick Cheney, Richard Perle, John Bolton, Paul Wolfowitz and others outlined Foreign policy, The need for stronger home defence and other things that came true before 9/11 ever happened.

Not only that but they even suggested a catalysing event would be needed to enact these changes before they would be accepted.

""Further, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event––like a new Pearl Harbor""

This is a good commentary on the document but you can also just reads the document yourself.

I havent watched many episodes of the Class Who, about 15 or so.  So I can't pretend to be well versed in it, but I had read once somewhere that there were three Gallifreyans who helped their race become time lords, Rassilon, Omega, and a third, Sigma or Delta or some other Greek letter.  Anyways I remember reading ( and even if I'm remembering this 100% I can't garuntee how authentic it is), that they all can regenerate eternally, and that the flow of time is through them, so at least one in needed to keep time going. And that when they reach their end of the regeneration cycle, time will start over.  Something like that, I could just be wrong.

In the end I think it's important for us Whovian's to remember when we search out for these threads in the tapestry, that it has many weavers, and was never expected to become what it is today.

such damages were not reasonably foreseeable, or

&gt; **Who told the judge?**

&gt; A defence barrister alerted the judge to the films, suggesting that although they may not contain any references to Birmingham, the judge may want to take action out of ""an abundance of caution"".

&gt; **How can he rule such things if he didn't see it? Who gave him the synopsis?**

&gt; the judge said that although he had not watched the films, he had read part of the transcripts and seen a two-minute clip on the BBC website. He can rule on it because he felt that it may hurt the defendants 

..

&gt; **It is well within the power of the BBC to release the program on the internet, but I am expecting that the show well air on TV after the olympics.**

They can show it right now, the injunction ended when the case did. Of course schedules are generally set long in advance especially with the Olympics looming, so it'll probably appear in a few months. As for showing it on the internet, I'm sure they could if they wanted, but I expect they'd probably prefer people tune in as that's a more measurable statistic. Like with most BBC content expect it to appear in iplayer once it's aired.

As for whether the judge can do this. He legally can if he thinks that it will influence the trail. He wasn't doing this to help the prosecution he was doing it to prevent the defendants getting an unfair trial.

&gt; He added that in the first film, the testimony from rioters in the first programme was similar to allegations raised by prosecution in the trial of the eight men.

&gt; He gave the examples of actors talking about the ""adrenaline rush"" experienced during the riots, taking revenge against police and bricks being thrown at cars – all issues raised during the trial. He said there were also issues in the second film, such as police officers talking about how rioters used BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) to communicate.

&gt; The two-part film was ""literally littered"" with potentially prejudicial commentary that could derail the 12-week trial, Flaux claimed.

Was it heavy handed and over the top? Probably. 

Was it some sort of shadowy conspiracy? No.

Can't argue with that. The whole thing is funded by a corporate gang bang and we've known that for years before. I don't think that's a fair complaint. It's the business model of the games. Obviously certain sponsors do seem to massively go against the spirit of the games e.g. McDonalds. But I don't see this as a problem per se.

&gt;the manner in which it has been used by our glorious leaders to tighten the authoritarian noose 

This is the bit I find a CT. The noose hasn't really been tightened. The tightened noose is just being reapplied to the Olympics as well. They've been tightening the noose for a long time. I'd say the Olympics were a target for the noose, not the cause of it.

&gt;the welfare-hungry elite trough-churning in a time of supposed ""austerity""

Yes, this a problem, as with every publicly funded project. But it can still benefit everyone. And if it benefits everyone, obviously the elite will get a slice as well. But we'll have to wait and see on this one. Which is why the negativity kind of annoys me. We haven't seen yet.

&gt;the have and have-not style in which it's been conducted etc.

Don't really understand this bit tbh mate. Care to expand?

I've been making to make a separate post on corporate welfare as being a topic for people often labelled as CTers. Strange we should stumble into the same issue.

Believe me, if I ever felt myself or my kids threatened or in danger or if they started dumping rubbish or all the other things that earn travellers a bad reputation I will have no qualms approaching them and saying something, as well as changing my opinion of these ones specifically.

Thing is, as it stands they're not actually doing any harm **yet** *except for the principle of the thing*, which you are right to point out. Yes, they should use provided areas when available (although before we say there *are* designated areas available right now we might want to check how close to capacity they are at the moment as well as how many are actually still operating, there was a bunch of closures last year if you recall because they were proposing a 'megasite' for them which has yet to materialise), but at the end of the day they're not yet doing any harm so I don't like to pre-emptively judge.

Like I say - these ones actually seem fairly decent - when I wandered through yesterday morning me and the kids ended up having a pleasant little chat about the area with a nice fellow who was drying his washing - it was the frankly scary looks we got from the people all gossiping around the edges that worried me more than the traveller we'd chatted to did. lol

I'm not denying in an ideal world they would have set areas that weren't originally purposed for other things and they wouldn't set up in parks, unfortunately the irony is that the plenty of areas where they used to be able to camp for a few nights out of the way (up by Woodingdean where I usually live for instance) have had those ridiculous soil berms set up to stop them due to the hue and cry of the NIMBY brigade... 

All I'm saying is let's judge each case on it's merits and aside from the catch 22 problem of 'they shouldn't be here, but they are because we took away everywhere more out of the way they could go' these *specific* ones don't seem too bad really so let's not get too upset until either they do something beyond 'being there for a few days' to cause it - or alternatively if they were to do anything stupid like try to make it permanent, which would be a piss-take and at that point, yeah, I'll be right there in the front row reminding them they're called 'travellers' for a reason... ;D",0,1342714891,null,0,false,0,c5gbvfd,t3_wrnke,t1_c5gbvfd,t1_c5gatca,null,1429416509,3,false,brighton,t5_2qprp,3

Or the fact that Germany, the country that didn't cause the war, was forced to eat dirt with the war guilt clause (google it because you clearly have no clue) and felt wronged by the winning side as they joined to defend their ally.

And please, stop saying ""World War"" there were two of them.  If you want to claim Britain suffered so greatly in both, then you better learn the differences of causation and impacts.  Thank you.

The first world war had nothing to do with race, there was no good or bad side.  Read about it, Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand, secret alliances, militirization of the European continent.... you know... history.

But hey, with that highschool understanding of events I'm sure you know more then me.

And no, I don't see flags that way here either, different ethnic enclaves keep flags in their areas in American cities, its a reminder of a place that was once home, and makes you feel closer to it.  But hey, maybe we're less xenophobic over here then in Britain, where apparently hanging a flag of your old country, alongside the current countries flag, is paramount to reinitializing world war 3.

But again, knowing history, like I do, I can tell you its not.

And I'm not angry because you're completely wrong on causations of the World Wars, I'm angry because you think that the simple act of hanging a flag automatically makes you think you're better then anyone who does, because to do so is stupid and ignorant and beneath someone the likes of you.

Your arrogance offends me.

Oh, well then there's not much dispute.  I agree.  Perhaps my wording was a bit loose, but when I said ""has been used""  I meant it was an excuse rather than a deliberate ploy (by the majority at least - there might always be malevolent souls skulking around in the backwaters of power, but it'd be a genuine conspiracy theorist's job (or take a piece of well-funded investigative journalism - so unlikely) to pull that one out of it

&gt;But it can still benefit everyone. And if it benefits everyone, obviously the elite will get a slice as well. But we'll have to wait and see on this one. Which is why the negativity kind of annoys me. We haven't seen yet.

I take your point, and I am prepared to wait for independent souls we both trust to provide a comprehensive analysis of where the public money went and where the private money was made.  I'm negative here almost by reflex, not because of a public mood or anything. I'm an anti-Statist remember?, and I simply assume (as is almost certainly the case) that such projects are designed to funnel taxpayer money to the wealthy.

&gt; ""PC Harwood was able to retire from the Metropolitan Police while facing disciplinary proceedings for previous alleged misconduct towards a member of the public,"" she said.

&gt; ""That he was then re-employed by the force, first in a civilian role and later as a constable, is simply staggering and raises considerable concerns about their vetting procedures.""

And [some details of the allegations of violence](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jul/19/simon-harwood-disciplinary-proceedings), none of which resulted in discliplinary action:

~~~~~

*Harwood was the subject of a number of unproven complaints after joining the TSG, including from a member of the public who said they saw him knee a suspect in the chest in Streatham High Road, south London.*

*The incident, in May 2005, was one of two prosecutors also sought to raise at the manslaughter trial. At a pre-trial hearing they said* ***an independent witness reported seeing Harwood knee a man in the kidney as he lay on the ground in handcuffs***.

~~~~~

*A ""road rage"" incident in April 2000 in which Harwood, off duty at the time, had a minor car collision and then became involved in an argument with the man driving the other vehicle.*

***When senior officers investigated the case, Harwood told them the other driver was the aggressor. However, independent witnesses backed the other man, who said Harwood ran at him aggressively, knocking him over and forcing him over his car door.*** *The witnesses said Harwood identified himself as a police officer and tried to arrest the other driver for common assault.*

***An officer who attended the scene later noticed how Harwood amended his notes to seek to justify the arrest, which was unlawful.***

...

*Weeks before the misconduct hearing was due to be heard, Harwood applied to be medically retired from the Met, citing injuries he had suffered in a motorbike accident more than three years earlier. His last day at the force was 14 September 2001. But his absence did not last long – just three days later, Harwood was taken on by the same force as a civilian employee.*

*Within 18 months he had successfully applied to become a uniformed officer with the neighbouring Surrey police force.*

~~~~~

*In January 2004, he was again accused of using excessive force, in a complaint lodged by a fellow officer in a raid on a flat.* ***Two officers said they saw Harwood grab a suspect by the throat, punch him twice in the face and push him into a table, causing it to break.***

*The arrested suspect, referred to as BE in documents cited during legal argument before the Tomlinson inquest last year, injured another officer, named as PC Newman. But despite his own injuries, Newman was reported to have said he was so shocked at Harwood's behaviour he insisted on lodging a complaint, which prompted a disciplinary investigation.*

...

*The incident involving BE was recorded as ""unsubstantiated against PC Harwood""*

***In May 2005 it was claimed he kneed a suspect in the chest in south London and in January 2006 it was claimed he tried to steal the complainant's phone and threatened to ""send people round to set fire to his house"".***

WHAT THE FUCK are you talking about ? The ""system they designed"" ? You mean the one where they ask local councils or ordinary working folk if they wouldn't mind having a billboard on their property, for a tidy sum of money each month ? It's ADVERTISING - that's how it works - they pay someone else for space to promote their products, be it on billboards, cable tv or the internet.

&gt; Is it really right that those who can afford billboards have such control of what millions of humans see many times per day?

Advertising isn't limited to billboards ... try watching a video on YouTube, or watch the Superbowl on cable, it's FULL of advertisement. What you gonna do, spray you own fucking monitor in protest at corporations controlling what you watch ?

Grow the fuck up ... you've decided by your own arbitrary ""political"" viewpoint that billboards are a legitimate target for vandalism. The world don't fucking work that way sonny.

&gt; That everyone else, regardless of how true or false their message is, is confined to relative silence? Is it balanced? Natural? Just?

They're selling shampoo and condoms ... get OVER yourself. This isn't the movie ""They Live"", and you are not Rowdy Roddy Piper. You should watch it ... really. Because you sound just like that paranoid moron who thinks the gubmint and big business is trying to control your thoughts via the media and advertising. And perhaps it turns out grey skull-headed aliens are behind everything after all, who knows ?

If billboard advertising bothers you so much, just ignore it. You are presumably strong-willed enough to do that ? But don't try to justify petty vandalism with trite political statements. It just doesn't wash.

IMHO this should NEVER matter, In the end STORY matters. The writer ideally should always be completely invisible to the story they are writing( My wife is an author of her own complex mythos and I help edit and am a sounding board for her ideas so I do speak with a bit of authority on this point BTW) But in the end LKH was just very lazy, it tried to gloss over a rather large plot point that had been building exponentially for several series with a supremely flimsy explanation that  did not do justice in any way to the idea... that Amy and Rory's CHILD was stolen from them, that child was RIVER and she ultimately MARRIES the Doctor!  Any one of those is huge and all together are breathtaking and to  just gloss over the very fulcrum of that point with a twenty second montage and frankly silly rest of episode is a rather troublesome hole right in the heart of River's story.

Emotionally, River deserved way better than that as did Amy &amp; Rory &amp; The Doctor. If the story has that emotional component and the audience is invested no one gives a shit about plot holes. Witness the R Davies era Martha Jones/Master storyline or the Tardis towing the Earth or any number of timey wimey things done over the course of the series.

Ultimately the *Let's Kill Hitler* episode was a fairly cheeky attempt ( The title *Let's Kill Hitler* bears this out) at an emotional cheat in order to jump right over dealing with the likely psychological scars that would've been caused by the events of the first half of the season and enabling the resumption of the blistering complex pacing Moffat had set for the storyline to conclude on time. 

As much as I love the rest of the season LKH comes very close to bringing the entire seasons storyline as well as River's down with it.

In ""Death of the Doctor"" (a 2010 The Sarah Jane Adventures serial), the Eleventh Doctor responds to a question from Clyde Langer by saying he can regenerate ""507"" times. Early news reports, before the episode was broadcast, suggested he would say there is no limit to the number of regenerations.[43] Writer Russell T Davies explained in an interview with SFX that the line was not intended to be taken seriously and is instead a commentary. He insisted that the ""thirteen lives"" rule was too deeply entrenched in the viewer consciousness for his throwaway line to affect it.

General elections definitely DO affect millions of people and yet you don't feel that they should be bound by the same turnout law as strikes.

I'm just struggling to understand why one vote should be considered void, but another shouldn't.  At the end of the day, if more people vote one way than the other, irrespective of voter turnout, does that not represent the will of those people?

If a less than 50% turnout is enough to successfully vote in a member of parliament, why is it not equally valid for strike action?

Sorry if it seems like I'm picking a fight here, I'm really not.  I just don't see the distinction which justifies the suspension of a democratic vote in one set of circumstances but not another.

true,square13,null,null,"General elections and strike ballots are two very different beasts though. General elections elect MPs to the House of Commons, if there is low turnout in a particular constituency then those who lose out most are going to be the constituents. Those who don't vote can't exactly complain if they get misrepresented but it's a bit of a stiff deal for those who do vote.

It's definitely possible that low turnout has elected some MPs who would have not normally won their seat had turnout been higher. In a house of 650 MPs elected nationwide are a couple of MPs elected in such a way really going to make that much difference when it comes to passing through bills that can affect huge parts of the population? Are there any high ranking ministers or shadow ministers who won in constituencies with low turnout? I guess the fact that there are 650 members acts as a kind of 'safeguard' against the MPs who win in low turnout seats.

Strike action on the other hand can have a huge effect on huge swathes of people, with very little actual support from those who are in a position to initiate it, there is no 'safeguard'.

For the most part the people reliant on these services tend to fall into one or more of the following categories:

* People who have seen their income drop drastically - either through a reduction in the number of hours they work; or a change to welfare that's reduced their income.
* People who have seen their income stop due to a welfare sanction / administrative cock-up, that's delayed their payments.
* People who have had an unexpected financial obligation - washing machine breaking down, etc, etc.

Issues, some would say, that could have been caused by:

* The alarming increase in the number of welfare [typically JSA] claimants who're seeing their claims stopped or suspended.
* Changes to the welfare system which has seen some people lose, in some cases, 40% of their previous income.
* The gradual removal of the Social Fund - an interest free emergency resource that certain welfare claimants could in the past access, if they need money for something - say to replace a broken cooker / washing machine etc, etc.

Food banks aren't nice places - I've spoken to people who've had to reply on them in order to survive, and suffice to say it's not a nice feeling, having to rely on the compassion of strangers, in order to ensure you and [in some cases] your family have something to eat for the next week.

Of course, when the Government eventually does away with cash based benefit payments; insisting instead on paying claimants in ""food vouchers"" redeemable at certain specialist shops, contracts for which will have been issued to the friends of those in the position to make the decisions?

And I've got not doubt that it worked for a while. But based solely on anicdotal evidence - what I see every week in Aldi, combined with comments from colleagues, makes me think that in a time when people are having to cut back, a significant percentage of people who would previously have been receptive to the welfare of animals have had to put that to one side, in order to keep their food bills down.

Some people will take the moral decision that the food they consume has to come from certain sources - organic / free range / ethically sourced etc, etc. And if they can't afford to continue to pay a premium for said food, they'll gladly buy less. Which is commendable. Bust most people quickly drop their moral objections, as they see their ""weekly shop"" increase in cost, week by week, month by month.

My boss earns ~£40k per year, and fits the stereotype of your typical M&amp;S / Waitrose customer. Two years ago she wouldn't have been seen dead in an Aldi store - My comment to her that I was planning on experimenting with Aldi as opposed to Tesco, at the end of last year was met with a look of pure horror at the sheer notion of shopping in such a store.

So this may not be relevant to *this* trial, the question is *why wasn't he charged with these previous crimes?* 

In this context it looks like a cop has been allowed to get away with multiple assaults - they were brushed under the table because of his status and he was allowed to get away with them. I guess because charging him would have been an embarrassment to the force.

&gt;You seem to have a class theme running through your posts. Sometimes, its not just about money or ""class"" you know.

I was born on a council estate, to two parents who had one qualification between them. My earliest memories are of both my parents hunched over text books and note pads, as they both studied for qualifications ranging from quite basic, through to degrees. I've personally sat opposite members of the cabinet and discussed issues that have been implemented on a national scale. On a daily basis I deal with clients who've been to prison, and have likely consumed more drugs than the average person knows exists.

I can cook a five course meal for a group of friends and not see any change from £100. On the otherhand, I can withdraw £40 at the start of the month, to cover all food expenses for myself, and have £5 left over at the end. That's eating three meals a day, and with 1L of soup thrown in for good measure.

I address people based on how their **character** - I know people at both ends of the economic spectrum who're wonderful people. I also know people who're utter arseholes.

&gt;My food bill has gone up like everyone else;s but there are simply some things i won't compromise on.They are knowing where my food comes from and trusting in the source. Despite the cost. I'd rather not have a chicken and get something else than buy one that clearly has burn marks on its legs where its stood in its own shit.

Video evidence clearly shows Mr. Harwood attacking Mr. Tomlinson without immediate provocation, which means there is no justification, because in English criminal law self-defence does not care in the slightest if someone provoked or attacked you earlier, only the events immediately prior to the attack in question. Absent evidence to the contrary, it can be presumed that Mr. Tomlinson was a rational creature. Absent evidence to the contrary, it can be presumed that Mr. Tomlinson did in fact exist. England's internal territories are not presently in a state of conflict, so the homicide took place under the Crown's peace.

The only issue **for charging** is mens rea, as if you were correct about the other elements not being conceivably present, manslaughter would be off the table as well. If the CPS charged with constructive act manslaughter, the **only** issue of contention over charging with murder would be mens rea, *because mens rea is the only distinction between constructive act manslaughter homicide and murder homicide*.

Furthermore, I am not attempting to prove anything; you are the one speaking with certainty that this absolutely was not murder. I am merely saying that murder should have been put before the jury and left to them, as was done with the manslaughter charge.

I might also point out that I am explicitly not basing my decision on a video clip, although the video in question is particularly damning. I am also basing my view on two pathologist reports that indicated internal injuries in Mr. Tomlinson, and using logic to argue that such injuries could not have been caused by a rational adult without that rational adult realising that his actions could cause serious harm to the victim.

* Are these schools state funded - do they receive any money either from the Government, or local councils?
* Will there be any scenario in which students who might not have opted to join said schools, might be forced to go, due to other school closures in the area?

If the answer to either one of those questions is yes, then I can **absolutely** understand the reason why people aren't happy with this. I went to a Catholic high school, and had a physics teacher who was quite open that homosexuality was a phase - unless you're still that way inclined in your twenties, in which case it's indicative of mental illness [Just checked my internet history, yep still a puff. Oh well]

*However* - and this is where the confusion lies - if they're not receiving state funding, and if the only people who go to said schools are those whose parents have actively decided to enrol them? How does it differ from home schooling said children?

There's no legal requirement to enrol your kids in mainstream state education - it's perfectly within your rights to teach them at home either yourself, or with the aide of tutors, until they're 16 / 18. Children who're home schooled also don't have to follow the national curriculum - their parents just have to be able to demonstrate the level of their education, in order to satisfy the local education authority.

I appreciate completely it's not ideal - kids, whether they're enrolled in mainstream education, or home schooled should be taught evolution as scientific fact, rather than a theory, but the alternative, I assume, would be that these kids would be in mainstream education and either told to ignore their science lessons / forced to sit them out, thus isolating them from their peers, and would then be taught the ""proper"" origin of the species, at home.",0,1342725734,null,0,false,0,c5geypb,t3_wtxyi,t1_c5geypb,t3_wtxyi,null,1429418034,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

[2008 Olympics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerns_and_controversies_over_the_2008_Summer_Olympics)
So many issues it has its own Wikipedia page. Includes anti-air missiles on roofs, terrorism, human rights abuses.

[1996 Olympics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics#Criticisms_and_controversies)
Once again, its own page. Over-commercialization, shit transportation, shit opening ceremony, and a bombing.

[1988 Olympics](http://in.rediff.com/sports/2004/jul/05oly.htm)
Riots, and doping scandals. And another [boycott](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Summer_Olympics#1988_Summer_Olympics_boycott)

[1980 Olympics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Summer_Olympics_boycott)
Where countries boycotted the whole event because a major world power had invaded Afghanistan.

[1976 Olympics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Summer_Olympics#Legacy)
Left the city with a 30yr debt, and a shit stadium.

And of course, a lot of the security issues stem from as long ago as the [1972 Olympics:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_Summer_Olympics#Munich_massacre) 
Terrorism isn't a modern problem.

[On shit sporting ceremonies in general](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics2000/926190.stm)

And without clicking on the links, I doubt you'd really remember the names of the cities involved. Or anything much about them. The same will be for the [2012 Olympics](http://wherewasitheldagain?.com) in 5-10 years time.

Oscar has that Brazilian flair, but more often than not he opts for smart, quality passes instead of doing a trick past 5 defenders just because he can. Can never have enough elite play-makers in my book.  25 Million for a pretty sure bet of a player who can contribute for a long time is fine by me.

Obviously I think Hulk is a beast who'd be able to help the instant he gets our kit on his back, but it sounds like Porto is going to demand a monster price for their monster winger. Can't blame them, I just think we could be in danger of paying too far over the odds.
