true,foss333,flair2,,"Do you think that a midfield of Sandro/Dembele/(Dempsey or Sigurdsson) is better than one of Parker/Modric/van der Vaart?  I personally don't think it's as good nor is it as balanced.

Sandro/Moutinho/Dembele would be as good if not better.

Dembele is direct. We need a passer capable of distributing the ball, short passes AND long passes as well as controlling the tempo and shape of the game.  We don't have anyone doing that right now effectively.  

The way I see our team right now is as a lot of talented musicians with no conductor.  AVB writes the score.  We need someone to interpret it on the pitch.

true,SpottieOttieDopalis,lfc68,,"&gt; they still believe once you've paid for a players you've bought their loyalty.

I think their time spent at the club plays into it as well. Whether fans want to or not, they form a relationship with players. How well that player and team are doing usually decides if the relationship is a positive or negative, in the fans' eyes. When that player and team are doing well, it's usually a great/happy relationship that fans never want to end. It's usually the opposite when the performance is poor, but, like any rule, there are exceptions to that.

&gt; People also make this argument Argument that selling him to a rival club is some kind of devastating deal

I think they're arguing more in concept than results, with Torres. He left to a club that we directly competed with for trophies, for 5+ years. Granted, we had a dip in form the last couple years, but the rational of ""jumping ship"" is still there. It's sort of comparable to the RVP situation this year. Arsenal are in a rough patch and RVP jumped ship to Man U.

I think I said this last time, but I honestly think people would have been a lot easier on Torres if we had invested that money better. Look at the Newcastle-Carroll situation, they invested that ridiculous amount of money and improved their team, to get them to where they are now. Ultimately we squandered that money and our performance has continued to be poor, while Chelsea's has been above average, further enforcing the Torres traitor wrap.

Such is life I guess, society will continue to discuss things until they see fit. At least there's cool people on Reddit to discuss things with.

true,James188,null,null,"Ok definitive answer time, without prejudice or unfounded opinion:

Police can stop a vehicle on a road to:
- check driving documents (yes, that's broad)
- deal with motoring offences (anything from broken tail light to dangerous bits hanging off)
- deal with other offences (wanted drivers, intel on drugs, weapons, etc)
- as part of a road check*
- as part of a survey**

It's an offence not to stop.

It's an offence not to produce your driving documents (licence, insurance, mot, tacho card etc) when requested... Technically you should carry them all the time; practically this is not a good idea so there is the option to produce at a police station should it be required. Also bear in mind that most of this is available on the police national computer (insurance recently taken out may not go on for up to a week mind) so the producer is dying out.

When considering searches of vehicles, these don't happen at random. There have to be grounds to justify this, acknowledging the fact that this is an invasive tool, but an important one nonetheless.
The grounds can range from ""your car stinks of weed"" (search power: s.23 Misuse of Drugs Act 1971), to ""someone has reported a weapon being fired from the car""(search power: s.47(1) Firearms Act 1968).
""You look funny"" or ""you're black/white/Asian/whatever"" are never grounds alone to search! I have never seen that happen and the culture of the organisation is scared of being called racist, so colleagues will rat out the bad eggs very quickly 9999 times in 10000 - rightly so too!

* Road checks are where a Superintendent (very senior officer) may authorise something along the lines of ""stop check all Red Volvo's on the A4126 for the next 3 hours"" in response to something like a kidnapping of a child where a red Volvo was used.

* A power to stop, rarely used, surveys generally managed by the councils and highways agency; for several different reasons of mixed value/productivity.

Generally speaking, being polite will get you a long way - it's simple common courtesy that certain sections of the community seem to have forgotten.

Rights wise, if searched, you should be told^:
Grounds for the search - the suspicion
Object of the search - the object sought
Name and Station of the officer searching
Legal power being used for the search
The fact you are detained for the search
The fact you're entitled to a copy of the search record.
On request you may also ask to see their warrant card (which should be produced if the officer is in plain clothes)

^should someone be stuffing drugs down their face to quickly make them vanish, the above does not have to be explained in its entirety before the search begins or the person is detained... Would be a bit counterproductive for all involved.

Mata would have to be in the top 3 for best on ground for the last 3 games but PPI would disagree, his overall statistical rank has him scoring 20-30 PPI more than anybody else at Chelsea but his PPI player rank has him languishing below Hazard, Torres, Ivanovic over the last month.

true,Intrinsically1,lfc50,,"Umm I'll give it a re-listen and kind of summarise/paraphrase the key points:

* Andy Heaton says he called Cummins personally and spoke to him and let him know the threat of removing his season ticket has been revoked.
* Heaton states if the alleged threats were true it needs to come out.
* He and two other journalists he knows followed up on it and the facts they were able to confirm that the meeting did indeed take place and that the threat of having the season ticket removed was made over some ""technicality"", and that beyond that a lot of the details vary.
* Heaton judged the character and story of Cummins to be legit from his personal interactions with him and that he also knew someone who vouched for him.
* Heaton didn't publish anything under TAW up until a day ago regarding this because he didn't want to involve the name of TAW due to the numerous discrepancies in the story potentially putting TAW's name in jeopardy and he hadn't verified facts yet.
* Heaton believes the threat on his season ticket was credibly made.
* Heaton spoke to the club and they said that the threat on his season ticket had gone away and he passed this along to Cummins.
* Cummins wasn't satisfied with the response.
* 6 weeks later Cummins publishes the article/blog post.  The unfortunate timing was due to Cummins not being legitimate press and not knowing the ICCP Hillsborough stuff was going to go on that day.

Edit: more points (probably inconsequential) mentioned about Jen Chang

* Heaton has had quite a bit of contact with him since he took over.
* He doesn't go into a lot of detail about his character but mentions he has worked very hard in including online (non-traditional) press in the club and press conferences, and he has also worked very hard regarding the ongoing Hillsborough investigations.

Speaking of passion as a motivator, it was the same impetus for Rose's reaction. While the argument could be made that his behavior was warranted under the circumstances... and I don't want to sound overly pretentious or hopeful here but it might come across as such... it would behoove Rose to take this experience and learn from it, not only to grow as a footballer, but as a young man.

The point being that racism is wrong, violence is wrong, and combatting the two against each other will only lead to more problems.

His view of humans tends to fluctuate, especially dependent on the situation. For instance, when he started off in his first incarnation(William Hartnell), he wasn't just not fond of humans, but he could be an outright dick to them. There's an early episode in which the TARDIS begins acting up, and strange things are happening, and his initial reaction is to blame his companions for sabotaging the TARDIS, despite them having no clue how to operate it.

Also, for as much as The Doctor tries to rejoice in the greatness humanity has to offer, he just as deeply despises the worst of humanity that give the rest a bad name. I'm pretty sure you are referring to The Beast Below, and it's a very good example of how The Doctor can react when he's faced with humanity not using its better judgement, and how much it frustrates him.

There's quite a lot of that same kind of referencial humor with Matt Smith, but it's fleshed out to reach all of Who. RTD made his Doctor Who very self contained. He would make references to his own era, but would very rarely connect anything to older Who.

So, you're right in that Matt Smith is very stand alone from the Eccleston/Tennant era, but if you know what to look for, it actually makes a ton of references to the whole of Doctor Who, and gives you much more feeling that Matt Smith is just as connected to William Hartnell. Hell, I'm still finding small and subtle references in The Eleventh Hour. The last time I watched it, about a month ago, I noticed the Doctor making a comment along the lines of,""Carrots? Don't be ridiculous!"" while Amelia was trying to appease his changing taste buds. This is a callback to the 6th Doctor, whose companion constantly tried to get him to drink carrot juice, but he always refused. It's super subtle, and took me about a dozen watches before I caught it, but it's those little moments I love most.

So I guess my point is that those moments are still there, but they span a much more broad spectrum of Doctor Who than the RTD in-jokes did.",0,1350453969,null,0,false,0,c6nodsa,t3_11lhg0,t1_c6nodsa,t1_c6nketd,null,1430168900,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

Likewise, recent upgrades to ATO on the Jubilee, and planned for Central and Northern also put the driver in the position of basically just opening and closing doors.

What is being talked about at TfL is that the current generation of trains being ordered right now will still have a person in a cab in the front opening and closing doors.

In America, the legal system is geared around the concept of explicitly granted rights, hence the constitution and Bill of Rights. The assumption is that anything not explicitly granted is not legal. This is one of the reasons why Americans always speak in language based on the concept of rights.

In Britain, however, it is the opposite. The starting legal assumption is that everything is allowed, and then laws are passed which forbid certain things. Thus in Britain there doesn't exist the same awareness and mentality around *having the right to do something*, because that's usually just a given. The end result is probably largely the same, but it does go some way towards explaining why we don't *appear* to have as many rights as Americans and why we don't seem to care about it.

true,TheAngryGoat,lincolnshire,Starkshire,"&gt;Are the people in charge insane? 

Yes, just a different kind of insane. Spot the difference time. American politician:""Jeebus says we should raise taxes on the poor"". British politician:""We should raise taxes on the poor"". It's a subtle difference.

&gt;Do I have to have an amazing job offer to move? 

Well it's not easy to get in without one. At your age your best bet is to aim to study here at University level and take it from there.

&gt;Are there any major rights that Americans have and Brits don't? I imagine that religion, speech, and presses are pretty much free.

Most major first world countries are pretty much in line, with only relatively minor differences. America is generally the odd one out, differeing from the rest of the civilised world on things like basic access to healthcare (everyone else has it, they don't) and gun ownership (A lot easier in America than elsewhere).

&gt;How are Americans treated? Is there a stigma against Americans? Do we get made fun of often?

If you're going to decide to be obese and run around shouting ""USA! USA! USA!"" then yes. Otherwise not to your face, no.

&gt;Where is the best place in the UK to live? 

buckingham palace, but availability is limited.

&gt;How do I go about moving? 

Move one foot in front of the other while retaining balance. Repeat until destination reached.

&gt;Should I attempt to gain citizenship right away? 

Not a good idea for anywhere. Would you buy a car without driving it first? Would you buy a house without checking if the torture dungeon fits all of your gear?

So what are we going to do with all these spare people?  It's a question everyone avoids but REALLY needs answering NOW before this future arrives and our base unemployment figures go through the roof.

true,cardassian_tailor,tennant,Tennant,"I feel the opposite.  I think that the show had more depth and seriousness with RTD.  I'm sure they talked about it in the beginning.  They hired Eccleston who had some of his major roles before this as villains.  He had a darkness to him despite his energy.  
I have no doubt that Moffat and RTD knew they would be making a more mature show but it did develop into a tear-jerk fest with Tennant because of his range as an actor.  They clung to the emotion he produced because he did it so damn well.  

I believe there are two reasons why it changed:  

They got stuck with so much tangled baggage from previous episodes and needed to start ""fresh"".  

It would appear that they wanted to make it more age appropriate for all audiences.  Torchwood was supposed to replace the lacking adult themes but ended up having its own problems and lost viewers.  

I love some of Moffat's episodes, especially the few he wrote early on, *The Empty Child*, *The Doctor Dances*, *The Girl in the Fireplace*, *Blink*, *Silence in the Library*, and *Forest of the Dead*.  Interesting to note is that these episodes were filled with drama and sadness, something that Tennant handled very well.  
As for the new seasons with Smith, I enjoyed some really great moments but overall felt like it never hit any high notes, with a few exceptions.  
I respect your opinion because the episodes are creative and interesting but I am just disappointed with the Doctor's character development.  He seems a bit like a child at times but wise when the plot calls for it.  Nothing seems organic with his emotions.  The whole ""Doctor lies"" line of dialog seems like an odd writing device to hide information from viewers till they want to surprise them.  

I am looking forward to the character of Oswin, because a character that complex with that much intelligence can play as a good mirror for Smith who is intelligent but seems so robotic at times.

Leaving it to the last day of the transfer window was incredibly snidey on his part. Left the club scrambling to look for a replacement. Which is why we ended up having to spend so much on Carroll. Torres left us no time to properly look for a replacement, nor to have time to negotiate on prices. So while we may have got a tidy sum for Torres he is partially responsible for us squandering some of that money. 

That plus he went to Chelsea. While perhaps they weren't direct rivals at the time they are still rivals in a sense. I know it was the right decision for him if he wanted trophies (which he got - despite not actually contributing much to) but it he must of known how hurt the Liverpool fans - the people who loved and respected him for those years he was a Red - would be by this move.

On top of that he must have seen we were trying to improve as a club. We had just got new owners and a new manager. We were signing a world class striking partner to help and assist him. You'd think he'd have at least given us until the Summer to see how things worked out.

If he had decided to go play abroad, and told the club earlier then I doubt there would be as much hostile feelings towards him. 

Don't get me wrong, I'll always be thankful and admire him for what he did for the club while he was here - much like I'll always be thankful and admire Owen's contributions to the club. Which I guess is part of the reason him leaving and playing for Chelsea hurts even more.

Leaving compulsary classes on fundamentals perhaps Maths and Language alone, with the rest of the time being focussed on learning how to learn.

Science, is largely applied maths, so you could use the ""learning to learn"" time to set students out to explore subjects relating to the level of math they understand. This could be simple experiments for younger children where they learn how to take results from practical work (rolling a ball down a ramp and varying its angle) and plotting the results in charts, perhaps with hints in the curriculum that they should look in their text books about about velocity/gravity/etc.

Literature and History in my opinion often go hand in hand, the only difference is often a matter of Fact vs Fiction. Perhaps one of the learn to learn projects could be to study a particular novel or historical figure, a write an essay on it/them.

The key part of this way of studying would be that the ""Teachers"" should keep teaching to a bare minimum. They would be more like guides than lecturers.

I can vaguely remember this case, but for the most part my opinion is based on the information presented in the article, which is admittedly a wee-bit biased. So with that in mind, I might not have the full picture. But anyways:

&gt;On the evening of Monday 14 February Mr Smith posted: “I don’t understand why people who have no faith and don’t believe in Christ would want to get hitched in church.

&gt;“The Bible is quite specific that marriage is for men and women. If the state wants to offer civil marriage to the same sex then that is up to the state; but the state shouldn’t impose its rules on places of faith and conscience.”

I fail to see how the above caused this man to lose his job. It's not like the more recent example of a marriage / relationship councillor who argued that he couldn't ""in good faith"" offer advice to a same sex couple. In that instance the person could clearly be demonstrated as failing to adhere to a level of professional standards, and could be shown to be discriminating against people.

Mr Smith, on the other hand, posted - in his own time, using his own equipment - a status to a private Facebook page in which he expressed dismay at the notion of religious organisations being forced to offer religious ceremonies to same sex couples.

On a personal level, I'd argue the opening paragraph could be argued - there are plenty of gay / lesbian people who also have faith, and who would love to have their commitment to each other avowed in the eyes of God and their fellow practitioners, but that's a whole separate argument for the religions involved.

That aside - in terms of his professionalism, there's nothing in that statement that I think even begins to warrant any kind of disciplinary procedure being invoked.

I hope he wins his case, and receives an apology.",0,1350478738,null,0,false,0,c6nr4nz,t3_11mizl,t1_c6nr4nz,t3_11mizl,null,1430170269,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

My point is that employment is an agreement between two people and shouldn't be subject to excessive government involvement or bullying by special interests like unions. It's up to both people to negotiate terms and conditions which they are happy with. Unions are generally self-interested, only really bothered about protecting their own survival and keeping membership fees flowing in. They don't care about the country or even their own workers really and often fight against things just for the sake of it. They're heavily political and will protest against pretty much anything the Conservatives suggest, ignoring the actual basis of the policies. Like those Conservative plans might get more people into work who CHOOSE the OPTION of opting out, but they'll fight against the existence of that choice anyway.

Also, with regards to Conservative plans to allow people to waive their employment rights - there's no indication that companies WILL enforce no breaks and carry out unfair dismissals etc. They might just want the flexibility that they CAN ask their staff to work more hours, or they can fire someone because they don't like them. And of course, the employee if free to simply quit if they're not happy with their employment conditions. Personally, I'd take the money - that's more useful to me than the vague chance that I will get fired and they would pay me redundancy. And if my employer said I couldn't have breaks at work, I'd tell them to piss off.

And with regards to keeping jobs, that's fine, if the jobs SHOULD exist. Driverless trains are a bigger advancement which benefits the country more than a few train driver jobs do.

Of course Moffat wrote the last episode of Tennant's character, which means all the highlighted sadness we saw in that episode was most likely magnified to become a foil for Smith, who in contrast is bright and alive.  

I used to blame it on Smith not having as much range as Tennant.  I actually enjoy some of Smith's wisdom and detachment from people, how he knows he is different and acts accordingly.  It is the plot of the episodes that get me.  I enjoy the humor and playfulness but I feel like it is written with a broader audience in mind, one that doesn't have any serious themes hidden within.

Sure we can get dodgy sponsorships, but there's a limit to that, and if you spend that money on overpriced contracts, you're not spending it on infrastructure, hopefully irrelevant manager sacking fees, and transfer fees. For example, it'd be quite difficult to afford someone like Falcao. Not to mention you'll have to spend more on everyone else's wages to give the best players parity.

I agree FFP isn't a huge problem for us, but saying it ""isn't an issue at all"" is pretty wrong.",0,1350481979,null,0,false,0,c6nrqjc,t3_11krt6,t1_c6nrqjc,t1_c6nl9i5,null,1430170559,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

true,geekchic,null,null,"&gt; Unfortunately bloggers just don't offer the same standards as proper journalists, nor do they have the protection of an employer or a union.

Some bloggers will lack the standards of professionally trained journalists - but a fairly decent number of them outclass journalists in so many ways as to wonder what the point of journalism school is.

Don't tar everyone with the same brush - nor assume that journalists need a union or a full time employer. Enough journalists survive as freelance operators as it is. A blogger is just a freelance who self-publishes.

&gt; On the one hand blogging is a wonderful thing, on the other it's killing off a vital part of any democracy. 

Nope - journalism is killing itself by not responding to changes in the customer demands. If consumers are reading blogs instead of newspapers, then it is clear that newspapers are not reporting on the issues that blogs are reporting on.

true,Delgado007,null,null,"I grew up in the 80s, became a fan watching the FA Cup sides so can't really comment on Dixie Dean or the School of Science eras (Wikipedia it). 

Having said that I know nobody has ever reproduced in English football the 60 goals Dixie Dean scored.

In the 80s we won the league, had the best players, the best team but were denied the opportunity to test the team in the European Cup as English teams were banned thanks to another team ruining it for everyone. 

Kevin Sheedy was my personal favourite player growing up, but our midfield in general was incredible. Reid, Bracewell, Steven, Whiteside, mcCall. These are some of the players I remember even though I was only 5 to 8 years old. 

In particular the Merseyside FA Cup finals in the late 80s were incredible matches. Swaying both ways until Liverpool finally won out. If you have a chance to watch the FA Cup final of 88/89 I recommend it. It was a cracker. 

In the 90's, money really started to dominate football, and years of mismanagement really took their toll. 

We won the FA Cup in that decade, which was the last time we've won silverware. Big Dunc was obviously a legend, but because of the lack of money, we tended to take to heart cult heroes. Andy Hinchcliffe was the best corner taker in the Premier League, David Unsworth got the nickname Rhino for obvious reasons. Tommy Mad Dog Gravesen came over I think around the early 2000s. 

But as our current manager David Moyes came on, he replaced our cult heroes with clever technically adept players such as Tim Cahill (who I would probably describe as a legend now) Leighton Baines, Steven Pienaar, etc. which has propelled us up the league and almost brought us that elusive silverware. 

But considering we have spent next to zero money (net) over the past ten years we have been held up as the standard that all non-rich clubs aspire to. 

However I feel unless we can break into the lucrative Champions League in the next few years we may never be able to bring in enough money to compete with the Manchester City's / United / Chelsea's / Arsenal's and Tottenham's. 

But it will be a blast watching the most cheaply assembled players compete against the money plucked superstars as it has over the last ten years. ",0,1350482237,null,0,false,0,c6nrsi7,t3_11jqv8,t1_c6nrsi7,t3_11jqv8,null,1430170584,2,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,2

We should also recognise there is a great deal of difference between smart and sentient, the computer flying the airplane full of passengers needs to be smart yes but does it need to be sentient?  No, it doesn't. 

That doesn't preclude us from making, at some point in our future, a sentient AI but by the same measure not every AI will be sentient just really smart in the area it was designed for (and dumb as a bag of hammers outside of it). 

A perfect example would be a horse.  It's an intelligent animal, some are quite bright in their own way, the majority are treated well and concessions made to their well being (as it is a living organism not something an AI would require), people who do not do so are punished.  Yet inspite of being quite bright and a living organism, we still ride on their backs and have them pull carts around.   We're talking about making mechanical horses that have no feelings, thoughts or needs.  

As you raised ethical concerns about such things, I don't think a sentient AI would really care all that much about it's dumb siblings; so long as they were well treated and maintained properly... much like the present day and organic horses.

Nothing is optional when you're competing for a job. We live in a capitalist system in which constant unemployment is a deliberate state of affairs, to ensure that workers must compete with each other for the available jobs. Think about what you're saying; the reason things like these protections need to be obligatory and not optional is so that those who *do* need the protections are able to compete on the job market. The glass ceiling is bad enough as it is without men being able to sign away their rights to paternity leave in a way no woman with the intention of starting a family can afford to do.

Carmen takes the Chronoskimmer from ACME headquarters and goes back to steal an artifact like usual. The Doctor just so happens to be visiting the time where Carmen goes back to. Carmen manages to steal whatever she was trying to, but the Doctor sees her. He can't stop her in time, but he follows her in the TARDIS through the trail that the Chronoskimmer is still leaving (because ACME never got it fixed). 

She realizes she's being followed and stashes the first item, but before she can completely realize her plan to take whatever is next, he catches up with her and tries to stop her by talking really fast. He obviously can't convince her, but she takes a shine to him. Then, a ripple effect from the first artifact starts to show. The Doctor and Carmen unite (reluctantly and temporarily) to stop it because it threatens her next target. 

Carmen eventually gives up the artifact to save history, and the Doctor offers to show her the universe, but grabs the Chronoskimmer when Carmen isn't looking and instead of ending up on some fantastic planet, the TARDIS drops in on ACME headquarters.

Whilst they were slow off the mark, journalists are not killing themselves by not responding.

Journalists, newspapers etc have spent the last 10 years trying to figure out the answer, but there probably isn't one.

The modern challenges are completely different. The hard part of journalism today is filtering. I think we'll see services designed around that principle. We could have a digital service which takes a subscription fee. Then journalists put their articles with that service. They get paid based upon views. OTOH the distribution service simultaneously tries to keep quality up, provide appropriate filtering for customers (if I read a billion science articles then don't give me articles about celebrity news) and promote the right articles.

Of course you'll get media organisations that effectively work as a journalist co-operative submitting and profiting as a pool. You'll get popular reader lists that a lot of people will subscribe to.

At least that is one idea. However the idea of a journal you buy from stores is dead.

He's shown total respect for that and talks in such an articulate manner.

Second of all he is a modern, forward thinking, ATTACKING/POSSESSION coach. We've not got the results but sorry we've dominated nearly every game. We're not even to 10 games of the season. 

He is also committed to young talent and spending what we earn. He can be our Sir Alex or Arsene Wenger. The owners would be ridiculous to fire him in the next 3 years. He needs that time, he deserves that time.

I for one would be extremely pissed if he went after a season. We have spent on the manager, and he's a fantastic man. Now we don't need to spend money unnecessarily on sacking people after a season. All focus should be on saving as much money as possible to pave way for the stadium expansion and more playing staff, and we can approach a bright future with Liverpool football club.

Arguably, even better than the Moffat episodes. 

Contrast this with recurring Who writers. I contend that MacRae, Whithouse, Thompson, Graham and (ugh) Gatiss have far too regularly contributed and with subpar episodes. We have 'Unicorn and the Wasp', 'Fear Her', 'The Lazarus Experiment' etc. A list I already consider far too long of stinkers that have marred both Davies's and Moffat's stewardship.

I'd rather have good writers writing for Who than the current go-to stable, even if they don't have a Sci-Fi background.

I got someone from the club to explain I was a member and the Katana was for a legitimate reason. They just handed it back over and asked for my name but I refused rightly so to give it to them. How you couldn't distinguish a stick from a Katana is beyond me.

Here's an explanation of what I do at the club if anyone's interested.

It's also actually still legal to buy Katana's in the UK as long as its made in the traditional manner and not some cheap shite that will snap of when you hit something and fly back in your face.

I don't think you'll find anyone in Scotland that *wants* a say in English politics, but it isn't like we can do anything about it, is it?

Anyway after going through the traditional spitting on the grave he was walking out of the cemetery when he was jumped upon. He awoke several hours later with a sore arse and discovered he'd gained 158lb in weight. 
 Since this occurred he finds that when farts it makes a noise which sounds like, ""Now then, now then"" instead of the usual raspberry noise. Also when he goes to the toilet for a number 2 it smells like cigar smoke and the turds don't just look like cigars but have little bands around them which reads 'Coronna.' He went to see his doctor who refered him to a Proctologist specialising in Jimmy Saville syndrome. This involves  Jimmy Saville now a fugitive from justice pretending to be dead by hiding up his ex-victims arseholes. The news was not encouraging. After performing several tests including: running a tape stating Stoke Mandeville Hospital require a new scanner within half an hour my dad was shitting marathon sponsor forms!

This graphic didn't make me wonder as much at the amount of tax in relation to turnover, but it did make me wonder if the problem isn't one of getting big companies to pay tax, as it is a problem about getting them to accurately disclose their real profit. Which in turn made me wonder how byzantine the accounting must be.

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; He also seems to express a belief that LGBT people cannot possibly be Christians 

That is exactly what he is saying. It seems that a good many Christian folk are of the opinion that homosexuals can't be Christians (Can't think where they got that kind of idea from). Consequently the notion that homosexuals would want to get married in a church is nonsensical and/or a nasty attack by the gays (etc.) who want to force their beliefs/lifestyles on others.

That particular idea is rather ironic considering that the most likely outcome of any legislation is that no such marriages will be allowed in *any* religious building - including denominations that want to perform equal marriages (i.e. Quakers) - and so essentially the result will be some religious people forcing *their* beliefs on everyone else.

By the by: In general The Christian Institute can go and fuck themselves, nasty bunch of reactionaries that they are. However, like a stopped clock etc., they're in the right on this one. One other point though:

&gt; If the meaning of marriage changes supporters of traditional marriage say they will be penalised for their beliefs, including in the workplace.

1 - Ppppffffftttt at the word 'traditional'. If this were 1836 the hand wringers would be lamenting all the marriages that were about to take place in the newly established registry offices.     
2 - Can't be penalised for your beliefs... Rather I assume they mean 'expressing' those beliefs? And it would depend on the workplace. This chap is in the right - it was his personal time.

Interesting what you say about IB. It's very harsh that people get rejected for something like History when applying to a totally different degree, especially when they have interviews and tests to check their ability in their chosen degree.

It makes me feel a bit of grateful to do A Levels (I simply took what I thought I'd be best at) with EPQ to get a sort of mix between good predictions, likely easier exams and demonstrate I can actually write essays.

One thing to remember is that you will have to factor in the costs of any equipment you don't have (Keyboard, mouse, speakers, monitor, even desk and chair in some peoples cases.)
Fortunately with a desktop you can really cheap out on a keyboard/mouse and upgrade at a later date, and nice monitors are very reasonable these days. 

My recommendation would definitely be a build your own as the other comments listed.

Retailers to check: overclockers.co.uk scan.co.uk aria.co.uk
(Check scan's daily deals, you can sometimes pick up a great deal on all the components for a complete PC)

As a professional system builder I will have to remind you to factor in the cost of a Windows license if you don't have a retail license (Shiny retail packaging, discs etc.)

If you want to avoid a full self build and want a fairly beefy pc on a tight budget I would look at buying a [zoostorm](http://www.ebuyer.com/395307-zoostorm-desktop-pc-7873-1073) pc and throwing your own graphics card in it. The build quality and case materials are cheap n nasty but you get very good bang for your buck.

What...the...fuck...are....you...going...on...about? Wrong. Totally wrong. Utterly and completely wrong!

They used a Digibeta to shoot at 720x576 16:9 50i video. It wasn't even film for it to look close to HD. They didn't even launch their HD channel till May 2006. It only looked fairly good because it was on fairly expensive cameras that had a lot of options.

Besides, proper HD has a sort of tell to it. Clarity wise. You could probably easily tell if something was shot in HD, even if it was downconverted to SD. If they upscale (or ""crisp up""), it would more than likely lose some quality. Especially if they take lower quality footage and re-encode it all over again.

Downsides are dealing with the late night revellers, the violence/bad attitudes of some of the general public and having to get up at 03:30/04:00-ish to start work.

Doctor Who is a space fantasy which sometimes has the trappings of scifi but it's not really scifi. Not even close. 

Remember how the Doctor [describes himself](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeJ4Ak2xCkw&amp;t=53s). In case you think that this is some sort of aberration that RTD or Moffat have created, remember that the Seventh Doctor was explicitly referred to as being Merlin in Battlefield. Not being like Merlin but that he actually *is* Merlin. 


Compare to Star Trek. Star Trek has some consistent approach to how faster than light travel works in that universe. There's no such consistency in Doctor Who on...anything.  


Overall, Doctor Who is a lot closer on the spectrum to Star Wars (Space Opera/ Space Fantasy) than it is to Star Trek (which is very soft science fiction as it stands). 

Doctor Who likes to put on a very fragile layer of science fiction but you don't have to rub far to see it's fantasy core beating underneath. Time Lord technology is essentially magic. This is of course partially an example of Clarke's Law but there is some hints in both the TV show and extra sources like the novels, audio dramas etc that the technology that Rassilon and Omega and the Other created was at least partially based on non-scientific ""magic"" which was rampant in early Gallifreyan society. 

Of course, the beauty of Doctor Who is that there is no canon so no one has to accept that if they don't want to. I quite like the idea, so I do. 

&gt; Gaiman is a good writer, he writes well in his genre, but Doctor Who is not a good fit for him

Couldn't disagree more.  In fact if you look at Sandman alone there's a character who has interactions with historical figures like Shakespeare, mythological figures such as the Devil, and numerous human and alien figures (including the Guardians of Oa before they were the Guardians). Who else do we know who has dealing with Shakespeare, the Devil and aliens? 

Gaiman is a good storyteller so he tends to adopt his genre/style depending on the story and character's needs. I think that's perfect for Doctor Who. As sychian says below Doctor Who can be science fiction, a western, a murder mystery, a fairy tale and magical fantasy all within the course of one series.

3. Explain the abitur thing. Some people will know, others won't - it's worth briefly mentioning that they're comparable/equivalent to A-levels or the IB if that's the case.

A few other things: Mention your driving licence if you have one, as well as any other potentially impressive qualifications. And if you're worried about your ""meandering"" career path, you could always leave out the bits which aren't directly related to what you're applying for and just mention them in passing in a paragraph at the end?

With VAT stuff, does an accountant make it all easier by taking most of it off your hands or is it still on you to get your head around it generally? The VAT threshold is keeping me holding my business back because the extra cost and stress of working all that stuff out is making it almost feel like it's not worth it as it's diminishing returns on any profits at a certain point anyway.

If for £100 a month all that stress goes away that would be worth it for sure, if, however, it just takes like 35% of the stresss away then I'm just not sure.

I don't claim to be doing any favors. I claim that the principle of openly sharing one's artwork for free has several purposes, one of which is to, well, share the art. To let people derive some enjoyment from one's creation.

I don't have the energy to continue such an argument. I only assert that I have gained no PROFIT from sharing these. I only wanted others to enjoy what I myself can enjoy (again: found in public forums).

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think that you don't always suffer defensively when you implement a DLP. It's in the same sort of category as pushing fullbacks high up the field: it forces the opposition to account for you in ways they didn't have to before. Basically what I'm saying is if you add a DLP then teams will tend to have to move a player out of their normal role to handle them. Best example that comes to mind of this is the England/Italy game where England had to have the strikers drop back and out of position to handle Pirlo, limiting their attacking potential. Of course if your opponent doesn't do this, then your DLP gets to do whatever he wants and you'd hope that would lead to a lot of goals.

I've had this come up a decent amount with regards to this and the wide players in a 4-2-3-1. Easiest way to think about it is that there is a reason that teams that play a 4-3-3 don't just hemorrhage goals compared to teams that play something like a 4-3-1-2 or a 4-5-1.

I'm not suggesting that a DLP won't weaken the defense, but I do think the effect can be relatively marginal.

I think for me the question just boils down to whether or not the player that you put in that role can really punish the other team when he finds space. If he can, then you should implement him, because it will force the hand of the other team like i described, while still being effective if he can find pockets of space. If he can't, then the other team will leave him unmarked and basically fuck you (excuse my language).

Looper works on a different paradox resolving mechanism then Doctor Who. Looper has a delayed paradox resolution machanism. As indicated by when they torture Seth and amputate his limbs he still had them to come back. Like when they cut his legs off, OLD Seth still had them long enough to come back in time. It was once he got to the ""present"" and time changed that the paradoxes occurred and could be resolved. 

A simpler way to take it is that theyre really is an OVERALL timeline but on top of that there is series upon series upon series of personal timelines. Sometimes those timelines intertwine on separate levels at separate points on it. So while we see it as paradoxes its simply only effecting each singular characters timelines. Whilst ""The Doctor"" or surgeon or whoever is affecting Seth in HIS timeline it immediately changes future Seth's timeline at the ""same"" point on the GENERAL timeline.

Like, Two and Seven were very good at playing the fool to catch people off guard, but they were rarely ever *actually* a fool.  

Eleven, it's not just for show unless he is *deeply* cynical and manipulative.  He just does too many ill-advised things.  (Just take a moment and think about how many things he did wrong in the last Christmas ep, for example.)  They've taken him from being a very wise man who occasionally plays dumb for effect to being an outright man-child in a thousand-year-old body.

Or, in D&amp;D terms, he's pretty much become the definition of a ""High INT, low WIS"" character.

I'm really, *really* hoping the next Doctor is more mentally mature and, hopefully, more physically mature as well.  They can't keep having younger and younger Doctors, no matter what the demographics say.

(Edit:  In fairness to Smith, I've enjoyed him more in the S7 episodes than in previous ones, and I think the writers are (finally) writing stories that play well to his particular version of the character.  But I still think they're just too willing to make him *dumb* simply for the sake of allowing him to complicate the plot through his own lack of foresight.)",0,1350533941,null,0,1350550658,0,c6o5mxl,t3_11n7u9,t1_c6o5mxl,t3_11n7u9,null,1430177183,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

* If you've got no formal qualifications at all, there are funds you can access to get basic qualifications - even upto NVQ Level 2. Accessing them will differ depending on where in the country you are - my advice would be to walk into your local college and ask for an appointment with student services. Talk to them, and see what they can offer.

* General inactivity: You really, *really* need to get on top of that. Sitting on your arse all day isn't good for you - either physically or mentally. Start exercising - maybe just a walk around the block. It'll improve your physical fitness, which has a beneficial affect to your state of mind. My GP for example will prescribe a Gym membership to people who're depressed, regardless their physical state of health.
* Learning to code: Don't pin all your hopes on this. Coders are one a million these days, and to get anywhere, especially without formal qualifications, you're going to need to be exceptional. **However** it is an excellent way to keep your mind active, and you can add it to your CV at a later date - so from that perspective, keep it up. Just don't expect it to be the factor / skill that gets you into work.
* Don't expect to get anything out of the work programme. I ""know"" both sides of the work programme - I work with people who're referred to our organisation who are on the work programme, and I know people who actually work for welfare to work providers. They're there to help you, but you're not going to get tailored support. And if you're stuck with a shitty ""advisor"" then you're definitely going to have to do the heavy lifting on your own.

My advice? Look into volunteering. Do you know what you want to do for a career? If not - what are you good at? Try and identify your strengths - and areas that need a little work, and try and find somewhere you can volunteer your time. This should go down well both with the Job centre and your welfare to work provider. Either they, or the company you volunteer with, should be able to cover transportation costs.

If you can find a volunteer placement where they'll ""guarantee"" you an interview at the end, you can also get help with the cost of getting interview clothing.

Secondly? Go speak to a doctor.  Talking to people / venting on the internet is one thing, but it wouldn't hurt to talk to a qualified professional, just to explore some possible options.

Coding is a good hobby to persue. It teaches you to be analytical, to follow logic, it keeps your brain active, and if the OP choses to persue it, it can lead to further progress. Basic HTML and CSS knowledge isn't going to get your a job.

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"Actually, it's a pretty poor piece, and I'm not just talking about turning his first name into a title - Stewar**d** Downing, really?

The first two reasons are basically two sides of the same coin - Downing isn't mentally tough, so subjecting him to a club like Liverpool where he will be under significant pressure on a regular basis was always going to cause problems. Also something something stupid price tag something.

It also contradicts itself - it points out that Downing created lots of chances, but then says that his form needed to pick up in the same paragraph. Unless they're contradicting themselves, they're suggesting that an out-of-form Downing still managed to create lots of chances; if that's the case, what's an in-form Downing? And has anyone ever seen one? 

It then says Kenny Dalglish's style was tailor-made for Downing, but it doesn't elaborate on why. And personally, I don't think Kenny's style *was* tailor-made for Downing - he was paired with an attacking fullback who made the same runs as him so they got in each other's way, and he was playing for a side that often dominated possession and was up against packed defensive units in the final third which he had to play through (as opposed to counter-attacking sides which left space for Downing to attack and run into). It's telling that Downing was signed *after* Liverpool lost out on Ashley Young, an inverted winger who wouldn't have gotten in Enrique's way and who is better at playing through tight defensive units.

As for why Downing can't fit Rodgers' style, it makes some mistakes there as well - Downing did play a lot of games on the right for Villa as more of an inverted winger, and he's one of the best two-footed crossers in the league. Though it is accurate in saying that Downing is neither a goalscorer nor a playmaker.

Point four is just about right, though; Downing isn't a first-team starting winger for a top 4 club (and his wages most likely mean he should be a relatively frequent first-team starter), especially one that plays proactive rather than counterattacking football.",0,1350553421,null,0,false,0,c6o8e7j,t3_11nekl,t1_c6o8e7j,t3_11nekl,null,1430178541,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

But to investigate where this goes... 

...at what point does posting such things become harassment? 

Imagine you had lost a child or someone dear to you and - during what I imagine to be one of the hardest times you'll ever face in your life - you see even more hurtful comments being made online, in the press, wherever. It's hard to see how that would help you in your time of grief. 

It's all too easy for the rest of us to brush that off and say ""well, it was just a joke - get over it"" but it's not *us* who are going through the hardships. It's not our child. 

I imagine many of us know through school how the jokes are funny and just a game... right up until they're directed at *you*. 

So going back to my original point - where does it become harassment? Where do you draw the line between ""that's grim, but clearly a joke"" and ""that's fucking insensitive and you're a dick for saying it""? 

Also, you probably wouldn't walk up to the family of the (missing girl / whoever) and say this to their faces... but what makes it OK online - especially if you know it will be seen? 

As I said - I'm in favor of free speech. The idea that someone would be given a prison sentence over this is frightening.

true,lol_oopsie,null,null,"I think that regardless of what political party anybody supports, people can accept that the whole system needs an overhaul.

Complicated, abused and failing is how I would describe it.

Complicated means huge amounts of wasted time and money in admin and helping people to fill in forms etc. 
Also bear in mind that many eligible people don't claim because they don't know or understand their entitlements.

Abused by everybody. Not just the 'scroungers', but the system as a whole can discourage work which is the opposite of what it is intended for. Also, the people who do live in benefits know how to manipulate it for maximum gain. 

Failing because the numbers of people relying on the system is forever rising. The country needs to be able to afford to run such a system, and so we need enough income to pay for it. While I absolutely support a safety net for those at the bottom and a buffer for those who lose their jobs, the system is far too expensive and too many people are dependent on it. I agree with David Cameron when he said that simply giving handouts isn't a good solution. It's actually nit helping them at all.. you know the whole 'teach a man to fish rather than give him a fish' principle. That's not healthy for this country. Furthermore, the current system fails to adequately protect and help the people who actually need it the most.

Overhauls are long overdue and hopefully the simpler system will cut admin, improve access to those who need it and actually HELP those who need assistance, rather than just giving them a paltry amount of cash for the week.",0,1350555690,null,0,false,0,c6o8lfo,t3_11naln,t1_c6o8lfo,t3_11naln,null,1430178637,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Wood *did not* directly post on the official page, or put his joke in any way in front of the parents or anyone associated with the missing girl or search. 

A real work analogy would be that he told his mates a joke, someone overheard and recorded it, then played it back to the people concerned.

It was obvious he had been crying the night before he was presented in a chelski top so I think the portrayal of him turning his back on the club isn't exactly accurate.  
  
I theorize that Torres made an initial enquiry asking about future club developments and potential additions to the squad and was told it wasn't possible. I then believe he made a transfer request in effect that it would motivate the board to do something about the situation. I think with a mixture of shock and media sensationalism bringing the club in a bad light after Torres quoting in the papers ala van Persie, the club decided no player is bigger than the club. Added with the awesome PowerPoint presentation that kenny and his team put together, they succesfully convinced the club to sell Torres to fund the arrival of the ""well win by stats! Aka Boston money ball team comprised of ""the white drogba"" Andy Carroll, ""better than mata"" Stewart downing, ""English talent give him a few seasons"" Jordan Henderson and ""the Quarterback/his corners are worth 6 mil alone"" Charlie Adam. 
 
Torres then realizing the mistake, it was too late. He couldn't salvage himself from the inevitable. With chelski eagerly awaiting and the heartbreak of being pimped out to the highest bidder, Torres reacted out of anger stating he wanted to play for a bigger club, knowing exactly that those words would strike deep in the heart of a club whose legendary history and status had been at its lowest. The club he knows was his place in this world, the same world he could so easily dominate.   
   
So after all is said and done, his armband said he was a red, we said he'll never walk alone, we bought the lad from sunny Spain, we bring him back hell score again, Fernando Torres it's only a matter of time.

Society can police itself from hate speech or degrading comments, hence why you can get banned from public forums for things like this; there is no reason to make it a judicial matter, someone posting a facebook comment (on their own *private* wall I might add) is not a legal matter.

If Facebook themselves deem it inappropriate then they have the ability to not only remove the post; but if they deem it necessary they can also remove the user from the site as well.

Speech should only become a judicial matter if it is a direct threat to someone's safety or incites others to cause harm.

true,p4rus,eng-essex,Essex,"I don't know much about education, getting back into education and so on, so I can't advise there. But I really cannot recommend volunteering enough. Do it. It doesn't really matter where, though I guess if it's an area you're interested in, that's even better. It gets you out and about, gets you a bit of a routine, learning useful marketable skills and, crucially, meeting people who can say on your behalf that you've got useful, marketable skills. In my area of interest, I volunteered on the reception desk and out on the trails at a local nature reserve. On my CV I was able to say I had good front-of-house people skills, had answered phones/done basic admin/etc in a professional capacity etc, dealt with members of the public, and so on. I don't work in conservation now, more's the pity, but it was great fun, I got some useful experience and made some good friends and contacts, who could, when the time came, provide a reference. Local charity shops are also an option, even if you don't want to end up in retail. You'll be able to say you have skills/responsiblities like taking money, opening/locking up, perhaps some basic admin stuff, more people-skills, etc. 

Most importantly volunteering gets you confidence. It gets you out of the house, and sets you deadlines and times to be places and get stuff done. This was the most important thing I took from it. When I was eventually offered a job, one day a week doing data entry for just one month, at the end of the month I was able to convince them I had the skills to take it on 3 days a week when they needed it. I worked my way in, moved on from data entry into a ""proper"" position and eventually became a permanent appointment, thanks in part to a fortunate bout of pregnancy for one of the girls in the office. I'd not have been able to do that without volunteering.

Maybe there are some volunteering opportunities in your field of interest? Any local businesses/pubs/bands/whoever that need a website? Contact them with a small portfolio of your work. Make one for free. You need to demonstrate that your work is good, that you can provide a professional product on time, and that it can be used professionally. Even if coding/web design doesn't turn into a career - and, I'll be horribly brutally honest, it probably won't - the ability to show someone something you made being used successfully by somebody else is really useful. I used to want to go into concept art. I wasn't bad, though not nearly good enough, so I made it into a ""useful hobby"", adding to game mods, CGI animations, etc. Nothing too serious but I was able to say on a CV that I'd contributed to a larger project, worked sucessfully in a team and so on.

And as a final bit of advice, tailor every CV you send out to the job you're applying to. No cookie cutter stuff. I'm not great at CVs myself, so I'll leave you to google this in more detail, but look at the job's requirements and squeeze every bit of relevant experience you can from your experiences. Worked on a game mod? Yeah, say you had regular skype chats with the team, worked in a team successfully and were able to provide work of quality, reliably, on time. Be, um, creative.

Here in the US such speech is legal but (depending on the specific speech), considered anywhere from ridiculous to outrageous, and is often voluntarily censored by the media or private organizations.  Where those groups allow such speech, they are often the target of demonstrations to coerce them to censor it.

Such pressure is particularly insidious when activist groups, in the absence of *actual* speech that is offensive to a group or religion, begin inventing supposed ""code words"" or ""dog whistles"" that their opponents are using, which supposedly mean something offensive.

Once people start believing that sort of thing, no speech is safe.

Personally I'm a big fan of unrestricted free speech.

The fact is, you live in the UK, a lot of advice and help is offered to those on benefits, I would know I have not long come off them. I managed to save money and use money to travel to interviews, all whilst paying rent and bills. You really need to use common sense, phone your job centre, ask for help finding funded courses, these things will not fall into your hands, you need to do more than ""look online"". 

I am also 100% positive, last time you made comments regarding this issue, myself and fairyjobmother both linked you to a section on gov.uk website where you can speak to an advisor about free education. I can guarantee you have not done this.

Like I say I apologise if this comes across as rude, I do not mean it to be, but if you ask for advice, please take it and do something.

When it comes to sacking police, closing hospitals or converting MS Office to libre office in all government depts what would you choose?

Libreoffice is perfectly functional (and just as snappy as MS office now) for most users, Hey if governments were using it they may even make it better....

Any modern distro with KDE - its more like windows than windows 8 is. Windows 8 looks less suited for business than even Ubuntu's unity...

Most of the 'features' in Vista and windows 7 seemed to be completed nicked from KDE4 (the 'new' start menu was essentially 100% copied) .. People who have never used KDE and have Windows would pick it up easily.

Since KDE 4.2 every single update (every 6 months) has been an improvement on the last, more usable and faster (compare that to Windows8)

What would be the point in converting to Mac - that would cost the tax payer more (to another patent troll) and not have a more effective system than 

I think right now the most business ready distros would be

* OpenSuse
* Mandriva 
* Rosa - http://www.rosalab.com/products/desktop
* Centos 

Kubuntu is great but it has no central control panel meaning it would mean teaching users to use multiple apps to configure their systems - the others I mentioned do. Fedora has a nice KDE implementation but I think its too bleeding edge to recommend. Centos I recommend purely as it has enterprise level support and 10 yr support life.

I work in an office where people get to choose, we have 80% Linux desktops and generally have no compatibly issues.

Here is a good example showing it can work

Here's what I learned:

* Germans love soccer, and most German bars will show German soccer.
* There are definitely sports bars in Berlin that show soccer matches from around the world.
* Most Irish pubs will show English Soccer.
* Everyone (everwhere, not just Berlin) loves champions league, most bars show a rotating feed of all the CL games going on at once.

So your best bet for the Spurs game would be an Irish pub. The CL game against Shakhtar will be playing in a ton of bars all over Berlin, the only problem is chances are it will be time-sliced with all the other CL games going on. It will probably be hard to find a place that's ONLY watching the Chelsea CL match. If you don't know what I mean by a time-sliced rotating feed of all the CL games I can clarify just ask.

The problem isn't with converting 35mm film to HD, you can do this all day long, the problem is what the source is.  Yes you can convert 35mm into a digital HD source, but depending on the type of film used, because there is more than one standard in film, being a physical medium, quality.  The quality and age of the film and the way it was shot will produce artifacts and film grain, back before the 90's when a digital HD standard was adopted this wasn't a massive concern because their concern was does it look good for the medium we are planning to use, now they are finding most of the films shot before these standards were enacted require a lot of restoration work, and its not because they don't have access to the original negatives, its because the method used for shooting produced what the production needed, it was never intended to be shown at a different standard.  This is true with early Dr. Who and Star Trek, shoot with Dr. Who the BBC just threw out much of the first two doctors because they just didn't give a flip.  The quality of the Star Trek restoration is crap, to minimize artifacting they framed the show in a stupid info bar frame and called it a feature, and then applied new graphics that didn't match the original film, this is very similar to these companies who recorded LPs digital to get the LP sound on CD, it just wasn't the same.  The film quality used for TV is very pore also, due to the fact that most shows have a very low budget and film is not cheap, and if you aren't familare with DesiLu productions, cheap was their middle name, the same goes for the BBC.  So no, I don't think you can get a decent HD from the 35mm used on Star Trek, at least without spending massive time and money restoring it, which will not happen due to the margins being so tight with the HD industry, and I suspect the same can be said about the older Dr. Who shows.",0,1350568250,null,0,false,0,c6oa9k5,t3_11mub7,t1_c6oa9k5,t1_c6o8bla,null,1430179424,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Converting film to digital is a tedious job at best, and if it was manual labor it would fall under the category of backbreaking when trying to get much of what is out there converted to an HD standard format and quality.

The conversion of a 576i to a HD progressive format is far less than what it would take to convert older broadcasts also, if they are using high-quality shooting stock or digital, and used decent standards for how they shot the show the only problem you have to deal with is going from interlaced to progressive, no interlaced is considered HD.  Also, by that standard the 1080i they use now is also not HD, but again this wouldn't be as hard to convert either.

Also, not once did I say anything warrants a Blu ray release, I for one am not a fan of Blu ray, the format is a proprietary overpriced standard which was created to bail out a failed large capacity optical back up format created back in 2000-2001.  I am on the side of a standardized digital standard for both Digital Downloads and streaming which will eliminated optical media all together, the infrastructure for this to occur is far from being available in the US due to politics and the standard is far from being accepted due to business propitiatory greed being perpetrated by some of the studios, e.g. Warner aka UltraViolate, Apple, and Amazon to name a few, they don't want to come up with a standard because they want to control where and how you view the files you bought from them.",0,1350569541,null,0,false,0,c6oajdl,t3_11mub7,t1_c6oajdl,t1_c6o8b7s,null,1430179552,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

So?

If the Oldboy remake is bad, I won't watch it.

As moderators, we feel that this type of behavior is completely intolerable. We volunteer our time on Reddit to make it a better place for the users, and should not be harassed and threatened for that. We should all be afraid of the threat of having our personal information investigated and spread around the internet if someone disagrees with you. Reddit prides itself on having a subreddit for everything, and no matter how much anyone may disapprove of what another user subscribes to, that is never a reason to threaten them.

I know full well what profit is etc etc etc. You aren't pointing out something I do not know. And, yes I know full well about profit margins and different industries.

The flaw in your repeating this ad nauseum is that the same company reports vastly different profits in different nations, and ones that map nicely to the territories with low taxation.

For example Facebook Ireland has 200+ times the profit margin as Facebook UK.

The Guardian can rightly infer that a ridiculously low profit means that money is going out of the UK subsidiary otherwise the parent company would not continue to support the operation. Investors would not stand for such poor margins year after year.

The major flaw above all others in your claim that margins could just be low is that the companies admit doing it, they do so publicly. For example Starbucks extracts 6% of UK turnover by charging a royalty.

The family and the boy, given he is so intelligent, would have known.  Seems to be a bit of a stunt?

As an aside, my son goes and he's not religious.  I think some scout groups are more god bothery than others though.  But still, ""a belief in god"" hasn't made any difference with my son's scouts group AT ALL.  They were making twisters over the camp fire last night and the week before it was a quiz night and other weeks its first aid night or games night.  Not an Amen in sight. He loves going.

The bottom line is the scouts is a privately run organisation.  Its up to them who they let in. And they are quite slack in my experience in enforcing the ""you must be religious"" rules. There are alternative groups IIRC  Isn't there the ""woodcraft folk"" group this kid could go to?  Or if not in their area, his parents could set one up, if they feel THAT strongly about it?

&gt;The main finding of this paper - attracting considerable attention in the press and media, in policy circles, and in university admissions offices - was the now well-known result that students who attended state schools prior to university had a significantly higher probability of graduating with a good degree class than otherwise observationally-equivalent students who had been educated in private schools. 

&gt;Observationally-equivalence here signifies, inter alia: the same A-level subjects and grades; the same social class of family background; studying at the same university; reading for the same degree subject. 

&gt;A clear policy implication of this finding is the following: in order to admit students from across the two sectors in such a way that they have equal probabilities of achieving the same class of degree award on graduation, applicants from the state sector should be asked to have achieved, on average, 2-3 grade points below those of their private school counterparts: e.g. grades BBB instead of AAB.",0,1350577634,null,0,false,0,c6oclwk,t3_11p1q2,t1_c6oclwk,t3_11p1q2,null,1430180529,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Another big issue for me is the midfield. I really hope RDM plays Lampard in the double pivot but I'm almost certain it'll be Ramires and Mikel, which actually nearly stacks up with our guys in terms of athleticism. We certainly won't be able to walk through them like we did United first half.

The one thing that is perhaps reassuring is the fact that Chelsea seem to try to impose themselves no matter where they play and that being the case I think we'll have opportunities on the break. Still, they managed a lot of possession at the Emirates and that was a really impressive away win.

----

&gt;New United signing Ryan Hall says he is determined to take the second chance offered by manager Neil Warnock. 

&gt;The pairing previously worked together at Crystal Palace, but by the winger's own admission, Warnock had to let him go from Selhurst Park. He has since re-emerged as a force at Southend United and the United boss has snapped him up on loan until January with a view to a permanent move. 

&gt;""I've been given a second opportunity by the gaffer and I want to grab it with both hands,"" said Ryan. 

&gt;""I had him at Crystal Palace and he was a great manager, but I got into a bit of trouble in the wrong place and he had to let go of me.
 
&gt;""He said to me then 'go get your head down and do what you do best' and he's come back for me."" 

&gt;Ryan steps up on the back of an impressive 2011/12 season that saw him score 14 goals and claim 25 assists, the highest in the four divisions. 

&gt;""It's a great step and hopefully I can show people what I can do,"" said Ryan. ""It's a massive chance for me. 

&gt;""Once I heard there was an opportunity to come here I felt things would go well and I want to take the opportunity to try and play. 

&gt;""The gaffer has told me to keep my head down. It's time I settled down and played. I would say that I've changed. I just want that chance to push on now and say 'this is me.' My family are over the moon I'm here and I want to make them proud.""

What a curious question to ask.  What do you think?

&gt;Hold on a sec, you claimed that ""no 11 year old has a fucking clue what they believe."" Are you now retracting that claim?

Perhaps it was a bit of a general statement, but most chat is centred around generalisations.  It was a throwaway comment which I think is fairly true.  So, yes, I stand by it.  But it's not a world of absolutes as you're trying to paint.  He could have made his mind up AND be confused.  And there's no reason he couldn't make that oath with his fingers crossed.

&gt;Indeed, they are within their legal rights to discriminate against the non-religious. That doesn't mean that people should not highlight this discrimination if it affects them.

Yeah, there's campaigning and highlighting issues, then there's this.  Look at the title, it's sensationalist.  He's not been banned.  He just doesn't want to take their oath, and so his parents have run to the papers.  Fucking hell, life's too short, get over it.

Nah, that's just the opinion you've formed in your head.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Also, I'm enjoying being downvoted so much.  For me it highlights perfectly the hypocricy of the Reddit user base.  I'm adding to the discussion, which is what is supposed to happen, but because they don't agree with my opinion they are downvoting and thus censoring me.  It's pretty ironic isn't it?  A website shutting out a voice that they don't agree with on the topic of another organisation shutting out an opinion they don't agree with.

In that case, the Bull's *claimed* that they never let unmarried couples stay in the same room at all, or perhaps it was just a double room that they couldn't share? It's possible they let unmarried couples share a twin. But that doesn't matter as when the gay couple went there were no twin rooms available, just a double (and maybe a single) - so either way the couple couldn't share. The Bulls claimed they'd had this ""No unmarrieds"" policy since they started the business in the 80's iirc.

However,[ the Bulls *had* let at least one unmarried straight couple stay: Ray Newton, the NSS councillor, &amp; his partner.](http://www.secularism.org.uk/nss-raises-major-question-about.html) Ergo: Their defence was phony.

In this case, I read the Christian couple as being consistent in their actions: while their views might be 'backward' to most people, they had stopped straight unmarried couples from staying/sharing. In which case, I can't see that they were being unjust in not letting this couple stay either.

I don't like their views - not one bit - and their notion that it's their ""private home"" is the usual bullshit from these types of people who don't seem to understand that they should be operating within equality laws where it fits.
