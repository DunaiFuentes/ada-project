true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"He also got a large signing bonus, which is pretty common for free transfers. Who knows how big it was, but probably in the millions.

I think Purslow actually thought that Cole would be a starting 11 player, even though he had a very specific role at Chelsea and while not obvious, there were a lot of fans who knew that it was risky.

This all stems back to not signing players on large deals. Sign them on a normal deal and then when they fit into the squad ramp up their deal. This is what we did with Suarez, who apparently signed at only £55k. Meireles was also on only £30k per week. With the bigger deals it makes it impossible to offload the players when they don't work out, which results in the ~30M or so of deadwood we had last year (which thankfully is now shrinking)

By my estimates, I think right now, today, our wage bill would be around £110M. The last published figures are 10/11 and they show £129M. City and Chelsea are at around £180M this year, I think our target wage bill may be at around £140M or so, which would give us a healthy wages/revenue ratio and also mean that Rodgers now has £30M p.a to spend in acquisitions and players.

Joe Allen and players like him would be £4-5M each on that, with their transfer fees amortized (£15M + 40k p.w at 6 years).

Overall, pretty damn happy right now, especially if we get Cole out as well and then never make the same mistakes again (like giving Carroll 80k).",0,1344065245,null,0,false,0,c5o0gxn,t3_xm674,t1_c5o0gxn,t1_c5nwxhv,null,1429549628,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

It is pretty common tactic in the EPL to use central forward players with overlapping fullbacks. To think that Enrique is just running out there on his own accord and getting lost out would be misplacing the blame. It is up to the manager to fit the abilities of each player into a tactic and strategy, and that includes covering the fullbacks with one of the two central midfielders dropping back. The best example of this is watching Real Madrid, where Alonso or Khedira slot back diagonally as soon as Contrao, Ramos, etc. get forward. If they are caught out in space there it isn't the fullbacks fault, because the tactics determine that the space is covered.

I think the closest comparison you could make, coincidentally, is probably James Bond. It's a very well known franchise in the States, and everyone has 'their' Bond that they love.

Otherwise, I don't think I really care for the idea that it's his mother.

In fact I think it's more likely she's just an ally that is against the high council rather than his mother being in the high council, herself.

true,timbstoke,null,null,"&gt;It's victim blaming for one, its saying ""don't be a woman and drink, or you will get raped"" which simply isn't true, rapists cause rape, it doesn't matter what women do.

Actually, it does. If we assume that rapists are out there and that isn't going to change any time soon, then the only thing women can control is their exposure to that risk. If two women have the same night, one takes care not to drink so much that she doesn't know what she's doing, sticks with her friends, and then gets a taxi home; the other one gets absolutely hammered, ditches her friends, and decides to stagger down dark streets alone to get home. One of those women is more at risk than the other. Is it her fault if she gets raped/robbed/beaten up? No more than its my fault if i get blind drunk and decide to walk home, then get mugged on the way. Like her, I chose to put myself in a position where the risk was massively increased. 

This isn't about victim blaming, it's about not assuming the rest of the world will take responsibility for your personal safety.

Oversensitivity to a subject is not desired and the police should be allowed to give out true and good advice without worrying that what they have said will be misinterperated. This reminds me of the ""Blackboard"" problem: school teachers were told to not say ""Blackboard"" and say ""Chalkboard"" instead.

Yes there are some classic Who stories on Netflix. Since multiple episodes formed one big story, they're glomped together on Netflix and they look like movies.

And there are over 300 radio dramas by Big Finish with the actual actors of classic Who doing new stories even as we speak. And there are certainly over 300 books from the classic series written about each Doctor. And there are approx 60 books for the new Who range.

The classic range is the EDAs (Eighth Doctor Adventures), the MAs (Missing Adventures- earlier Drs), the PDAs (past Doctor adventures), and the NAs (New Adventures), and then the new series stuff is called the NSAs (new series adventures).

Coincidentally I just finished reading a first Doctor story called *The Sorcerer's Apprentice* and now I'm reading *The Witch Hunters*, also with the first Doctor.

This is not a complicated procedure, while there are complications and various levels to the tika taka system that take time to learn it should not take long for a team playing at a level such as Liverpool to adapt to such a method. 

---------------------------------------

I agree when you say you cant just start playing it because like anything it must progress slowly through time and the players must learn how to react when they dont have the ball or lose it.

But Rafa said the best way to learn something is by practically applying it (in reference to moving Gerrard around but same theory applies here) training can only get you so far.

We shouldn't tell the guys to play tika taka and then expect them to play well straight away because if it goes wrong and they panic, but that being said while we are in control we can certainly try to implement the control of the ball and working on our positioning game by game which is what should have happened in these warm up games but instead Rodgers chose to watch the players.

Eccleston's Doctor was so versatile.  He shows the many faces of The Doctor in very believable ways because he's just a damn good actor.  At times he can be charming, witty, and can magically lighten the situation when it was just almost deadly (think ""The Doctor Dances"").  However, you really see the wear and tear on his character over the grief related to the Time War.  The way his eyes just go beat red, almost about to break down, when the Tree offers him sympathy was just so sudden and powerful.  However, and this is where he really shined in my opinion, I think Eccleston was at his best whenever faced with a Dalek.  You want to talk about the Legend of the Doctor?  The first time he's alone with the broken Dalek in the Cage...I mean holy crap, I wasn't sure whether to be afraid or turned on.

On one level, this could suggest many looters were not serious criminals, but, given the younger profile of those involved, it could also mean the courts are dealing with lots of people whose criminal careers had only just begun.

You are spreading nonsense and claiming to have authority on a matter you evidently know little about.  Your retort is to complain and whine about people not being open minded, that physicists apparently make claims that you personally find ""radical"" and that the world is just ""complex"".

I called you out and you end up moaning about it.  In future try to actually understand a subject so this doesn't occur again.  Maybe amongst your peers you seem brilliant and smart because they don't know any better, but elsewhere others may point out your bullshit.

Oh, of course, you want arguments because you think science is a big debate.  One interpretation must be equal to any other?  It's all up in the air according to your intuition, right?  I mean, isn't that the fair and democratic thing?

I'll leave you with the apt words of Isaac Asimov:

&gt;There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that ""my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.""

You should know that your ""reasoning"" is exactly what leads to people believing in creationism and similar nonsense, however superior you regard your own views to be.

Torres barely got a touch but looked great when he did.

Lamps was our best player of the half IMO. Easy to say when he got the goal, but at least he made an attempt at making something happen.

Defense looked super lazy on the goals and on set pieces.

Hazard looks 100% lost on the left flank... not ideal when Rami/Ivanovic look a billion times more threatening than Hazard/Cole. He needs to be more involved, but the problem is every time he gets on the ball he has nobody to play in. He is also drifting in field far too much, leaving nobody to link up with Cole on the left. You can tell the players on the pitch are begging for him to make something happen (how many times that half did he get little tap passes from midfield players, almost a sort of ""no, you have it"" pass?).

true,[deleted],null,null,"Mr Scott clearly hasn't read the Metropolitan Police Service report he cites in his article, so it's not surprising his anger is misdirected.

Far more important than the failure of the MPS to notify Duggan's parents of his death — an honest mistake which the Met have publicly acknowledged and apologised for — is the failure of the MPS to more aggressively rebut misinformation surrounding his death.

The MPS report goes into great detail about the misinformation that propagated in the days following the shooting, fuelling the anger and anti-police sentiment of the local community, and ultimately causing the outbreak of the riots. It explains why the MPS failed to rebut this information, and the steps they have taken to ensure this doesn't happen again.

Nevertheless, if Mr Scott wants to point fingers, we can play that game.

Who propagated the rumour that Duggan was killed in an ""exchange of fire"", a narrative attributed broadly to the authorities which, when it later emerged to be false, was seized upon by those with a pre-existing aversion to authority as an example of the police spreading misinformation themselves? It was a Press Association report citing an unnamed IPCC spokesperson. Not the police. All of a sudden the police were supposedly ""caught out"" telling porkies, there were ""questions"" surrounding the shooting, and all the correct information which largely justified the shooting — that Duggan was a ""gangster"", shot while in possession of a firearm, etc. — was treated with scepticism.

Who propagated the false claims that Duggan was pinned down on the ground and shot ""assassination style"", with multiple shots to the head? An eyewitness report published in the Evening Standard on 5th August, further propagated by members of the Haringey Borough Black Independent Advisory Group (BIAG) during a community meeting on 6th August before the riots began.

Long after the assassination rumour was eventually rebutted, we had [Darcus Howe making a fool of himself on BBC News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoFak7MRBJw) still claiming ""a police officer blew [Duggan's] head off"" and trying to romanticise the rioting as an ""insurrection"".",0,1344096050,null,0,1344097077,0,c5o3vvi,t3_xnynm,t1_c5o3vvi,t3_xnynm,null,1429551300,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

The couple times he did get in behind and run into space was when we looked most likely to score. It was brilliant awareness to dummy to ball for Frank to score, and he linked up well with Frank on a couple other occasions during the game (Lampard was our best player by a mile btw). 

The fault has to lie with the players who had the ball in long periods of the game and didn't manage to use it effectively. You also have to ask questions of RDM. It's one thing saying Hazard was ill-disciplined on the left hand side and he should work on that element of the game when really thats RDM job to ensure that every player knows there role going forwards and backwards and to fix things when they're going wrong. 

Merieles isn't good enough for Chelsea, he shouldn't be near our first team when everybody is fit. I think Mata rejoining the squad will improve  things so much.

&gt; The average national detection rate for burglaries is about one in 12, though even this is an overstatement, due to police manipulation of the figures. Approximately 800,000 domestic burglaries took place in Great Britain in 2009; this means that some 67,000 were detected by the police. In that same year, 6,136 people went to prison in Great Britain for burglary (for an average of 17 months each).

So, the cost of locking up burglers is about £233 million, which is a lot of money, but the prison cost per burglery is less then £300.  If I had the choice of being burgled or paying £300, I'd pay, which isn't quite the choice in question, but it does suggest that we get good value for money when we lock up recidivist burglers.",0,1344100987,null,0,false,0,c5o4vtm,t3_xnynm,t1_c5o4vtm,t1_c5o3wfi,null,1429551772,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,rumnscurvy,Churchill,Churchill,"Hello fellow Mathmo ! (This is the expression used to designate maths undergrads here, by the way). A few pointers about the maths course :  

* Don't worry too much if you start off doing subjects you find boring or uninteresting, you will specialise later. They have to teach you all the basics in first year, and you pretty much have to do as much as you can in the exams. In second year you start getting a bit of choice, and by the third year you will have to choose all your subjects yourself !   

* The work you will be given consists (exclusively) of example sheets, that is, a page's worth of questions of varying difficulty that you can tackle with the knowledge you've learnt up until now, once every two weeks, one sheet for each subject you have. Do not underestimate two things about them, one, the time it will take you to do them (don't spend your whole life on them either, but they usually take up to 10-15 hours to complete), two, the amount you will learn in the process. These example sheets are what makes Cambridge teaching special, since the course material itself is available anywhere ! Your work will be corrected (but not necessarily marked) by supervisors, and you will have an hour-long supervision with the person in question where he will go through your answers, detailing what's right and wrong in the process.   

* It may not seem like it but your supervisors and your DoS (director of studies) are here to help you. If you're struggling with some concepts in the course, don't hesitate to ask your supervisor, during the supervision or via e-mail. If you're struggling with the workload and don't know what to do, your DoS can help you out. If a supervisor turns out to be unhelpful, report it to your DoS.

* Get a whiteboard, save on paper. You can get them cheap around here, I tried bringing mine on the plane (also an EU student) and none of them made the trip... It's your call really.  

* As others have suggested, I strongly suggest you get a bicycle once you're there, a second-hand one will do, and most importantly *bike lights*, you can and will get fined if your bike is not equipped with them after dark. In winter in the UK it gets dark deceptively early, you don't want to get caught out !  

* If you're into ""online culture"" as you say, once you've got your internet sorted out in your room, check out CamDC, you will not regret it.  

* And finally, always make some time during the day and over the week to kick back, relax, have a nap or a drink with friends ! You'll manage much better if you can keep your work from invading your thoughts every waking hour (and sometimes the unwaking ones, you'll be having maths dreams yet...)

mate thats really uncool adding that extra comment line after you posted the comment to make it look like im trying to dog people from Liverpool, thats just uncool....

I never made it out like it was a specific liverpool problem, I made that clear in the line 

&gt; **Im not saying its Liverpool fans that will be looking to take advantage but in big crowds its easy for thieves to distract and take advantage of unsuspecting people**

-----------------------------------

So addressing line by line

&gt; **What the fuck man? What exactly are you trying to say about liverpool fans/people?**

No.

Stop right there.

Where at all did you get any sense that I was attacking Liverpool or the club?

Ive said time and time again to other fans on here that you should never bad mouth your own fans..

THAT BEING SAID, are we going to sit here and pretend that Liverpool (the city not the club/fans) doesn't have a bit of a stereotype for theft? My Liverpool friends make jokes about theft in there community which became more evident when I was robbed..in broad day light, near the stadium...and im a big guy

Still I said it was thieves working and not the club/fan related

&gt; **Theft is no more a problem at anfield than at any other stadium.**

Maybe so but again lets not sit here and act like we havent got dick supporters out there (like any other club) that look to take advantage of people. 

...I also never suggested it was a problem, even though I was robbed and a friend I still put it down to thieves 

&gt; **And not to mention its all pretty condescending to suggest op doesnt already know how to look out for himself.**

AGAIN, never said he didnt know how to look after himself, please with all respect STOP jumping to conclusions...

i know you're having fun setting up silly answers to argue against, how about instead of guess about my opinions on the philosophy of science how about actually debating the science?  
  
i mean first you shrug off a lecture by an MIT professor at the Institute for Quantum Computing as a 'youtube video' and 'internet gossip' then you have the gall to say i'm moaning about 'people not being open minded' no, i'm moaning about you being abjectly incredulous.  
  
and yes, i do think a lot of scientists have very radical notions; that's an important part of science - you think there aren't radical branches of quantum theory? ha!  even string field theory is pretty darn radical.  
  
The issue is that you've got a very simplistic notion of science, you probably know the basics fairly well - however there's a whole other world of theoretical physics and maths which will blow your mind.  I mean geez, don't you ever watch any feynman lectures? the world is *not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose* (to quote a biologist) 
  
So no, i'm not talking about some form of creationism - i'm talking about something which is completely compatible with all the current models of the universe.  If you followed the largest scientific story of the century then you might have heard that with the discovery of the Higgs they're now working on the important questions revolving around a study of if it decays isotropically; maybe soon we might have further proof of it working either via supersymmetry or extra dimensions - right now it could be either or a dozen other things, or something no one even guessed at...  Your assumption that *science and 'what seems sensible' are the same* is just as dangerous as the notion that *anything goes* which you rally against.

What you're asking is whether each participant in a crime is individually responsible for the complete result, or a fraction of the result, right?

If one guy rapes a girl he incurs a full sentence. But if a group of men rape a girl - should they just be given a slap on the wrist for a partial contribution - or each pay for the rape (or multiple rapes) of the girl?

And in a riot situation - where *massive* damage is done to a community and people's lives - should participants just receive a slap on the wrist - or be made to feel the full consequences of the devastation to the community they enabled, encouraged, and participated in?

true,Bendigeidfran,cnty-wales,Cymro alltud,"Firstly, I think the rape analogy is quite frankly rubbish. 

I agree that participants should be punished, what I disagree with is that people (for example) caught stealing things during the riots were treated much harsher than thieves are normally treated in the criminal justice system. In my view these harsher sentences were due to political meddling in order to seem 'tough on the riots' (or whatever), which is wrong.

I'm not arguing that our justice system is too harsh or too lenient, what I'm saying is that it should be **consistent**. A thief during the riots should be treated as a thief is normally treated.

When playing for the national team, he usually stands out in his passing and free kicks/corner kicks. He said in the past he wants to model his game after Gerrard but the more I've seen him play, I picture more of a Korean Xabi Alonso than a Gerrard. He's not an aggressive attacker but rather distributes the ball quite well being only 23 years old but attempts the occasional long range shots like Gerrard. He does have a tendency disappear for spells during a match and can get a little nervous on the ball when pressured. I wish he was a bit more tenacious on defense but overall I think he has the skill set to really contribute to a top team in the future.

Definitely look at Ki Sung-Yeung. He's young, he's talented, and he's not a mainstay at his current club. We are a huge club in the world, although our recent seasons have been disappointing, but we have a global brand and global scouts. Not that I have anything against them (I actually quite like them), but why did we move for Henderson, Carroll and Downing for so much money? Why did we spend 8 million on Charlie Adam instead of 5 million (allegedly) for Yohan Cabaye?

We have become dependent not on British players, but on the Premier League as a talent source and the focus on British players is a side-effect of that. Players from within our league are almost always going to be more expensive than players from other leagues.

I've been watching Joe Allen, though I'm no expert, and he's good. He can be a decent stand in for Lucas, and he's got skill, but if we're going to drop 15 million on him, are we sure he's the best there is for what we need?

People go nuts over Asian players because of ""THE MERCHANDISING"", which I find ridiculous. Park Ji-Sung is the exception, not the rule and I doubt we'd make back SO MUCH MONEY in Korea just by picking up Ki Sung-Yeung, but here are the facts. If the news is to be believed, we are considering a 7 million bid for Ki, far less than the 12.5-15 numbers floated around for Allen. Ki is the same age, way cheaper, and arguably more talented.

I trust Rodgers and I like his style, but if he tries to build his squad around players he already knows, eventually we'll run out of options. There are only so many good players from Swansea and Chelsea's Youth Squad. When weighed with the other factors, the fact that ""Brenden knows him"" shouldn't be the most important reason to go for Allen.

I confess that I am not an expert on either player and only know them from incidental matches I've seen (A few Celtic games, a few Swansea games, and the Olympics), but I think we (both as supporters and as a club) should warm up to looking to players in places you wouldn't expect.

A good analogy to show the flaws of what the MRA lot argue with that stat is like making the argument that women are just as dangerous drivers as men because they have as many or more incidents in cars. Men have the same amount of incidents or sometimes slightly less. Therefore under those rules it stands that women are as bad drivers as men.

Now if you were told counting these incidents the majority of female drivers had very slow collisions or hit parked cars, caused few serious injuries, few high speed collisions and almost none of the deaths caused by road accidents. There are occasional rare fatal collisions not many.

That men with the same number of incidents did also had the vast majority of high speed collisions, caused the most deaths to pedestrians and other road users and damages that ultimately cost insurance people many times more than the female incidents as they just had less of the low speed and stationary collisions where there werent injuries or at least minor ones and minor damage.

Almost every other episode has had ""River Song"" namedropped into the plot and turned the entire episode's story about her and who she is. She was overexposed and Doctor Who became The River Song Show. Matt Smith's portrayal as The Doctor basically became all about River Song's life instead of giving us ""The Doctor travels with his companion"" which is what the show is supposed to be about.

And don't get me started on the same damn ending to both of his/Moffat's series' so far. ""What's that? Can't think of a unique way to write out of this corner? REBOOT EVERYTHING... AGAIN!""

What I am saying is they are using deliberately obsufacting statistics to improve their side of the argument at the expense of what actually happens and this debases it by misleading people. What most people count as domestic violence happens to men but in an incredibly small number. Yes there should be, and are, services to help these men but most will be focused around women because that is where the majority of the need is.

Severe and sustained domestic abuse (the kind people think of when thinking about domestic violence) is committed overwhelmingly by men.

Would you call a drunken and one off open palmed slap by a girlfriend outside a club the equivalent to a heavy beating with numerous blows to the head, one of many such beatings, followed by spousal rape? I would call that a false equivalence but that is what MRA does when using those arguments and statistics. 

The studies/stats they quote lump everything in together because they have an incredibly broad definition of what counts as domestic violence and what turns up in their stats. .

Another indicator is that far more women than men die or are hospitalised as a direct result of domestic violence.",0,1344129416,null,0,false,0,c5oax4x,t3_xoelh,t1_c5oax4x,t1_c5oakfn,null,1429554703,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I agree that it can be somewhat frustrating that Torres (seemingly) isn't going to create a lot of goals by himself from nothing, but given the amount of creative talent we have signed in midfield he could potentially be the perfect compliment up top. Someone who can make the decisive runs, dart behind the defense, collect the ball and calmy finish.

The you see things where Spurs offer 12m and 14m but Inter for at least a year has had a reported 20m+ price tag on him. So as would be expected Levy goes in lower and Inter has little interest in selling one of their prizes on the cheap.

I don't think this one goes through, but since we have no strikers and it seems a matter of time before he ends up somewhere in Europe and we have made offers before this one will keep coming up especially on days where he scores a brace in the Olympics.

true,ravniel,num11,,"&gt; We are gonna get strikers.

But we needed them *already*.  AVB is supposed to be training the squad and building his first XI.  Right now he's missing two key members of that first XI - he has no first-choice CM (Modric/Modric Replacement) and he has no senior striker at all.  So he's missing his playmaker and the focal point of his attack.  He can't even *simulate* the game we'll be playing when the season starts.

These friendlies are supposed to be giving match time to some of his key players so they'll be fit for the start of the season.  Right now they're essentially being wasted; AVB is being forced to play with a team nothing like the one he'll be using, because he *doesn't have that team yet*.  Whether Modric stays or not, he can't be at all relied upon for the start of the season.  He's been training with the reserves, he's had no match time since the Euros, he'll either miss the first couple games of the season or he'll mope through them.  Defoe has also not been training with the first team as far as I know, he also has little or no match time; so it's anyone's guess whether *he'll* be fit for the start of the season, he's very unlikely to be at his peak, and he isn't a center-forward in any case.  That's not going to make for an *embarrassing* starting XI but it's certainly a decidedly makeshift one which should inspire little confidence.

I think Levy is happy to let these crucial deals run until midnight on the 31st, and I think that's a huge mistake when you've just hired a tactically demanding manager known to play a specific kind of game not everyone can do.  AVB needs time with the squad and it's frankly too late for him to get it now, even if we made our purchases soon.  And I don't see any evidence that we will.

Also: 

&gt; Lewandowski

I'm honestly asking: why does this name keep being mentioned?  There's just no chance whatsoever.  He's the first-choice striker for the Bundesliga Champions and they're in the Champions League.  I don't know his wages but even those are probably better than we'd give him.  We have nothing to offer Lewandowski.  I think Damiao is also extremely unlikely, but I won't address that because the rumor-mongers still seem fairly confident.",0,1344137073,null,0,false,0,c5ocmpg,t3_xp2b7,t1_c5ocmpg,t1_c5obq6x,null,1429555510,12,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,12

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"Oh my goodness, so many good places to start. If you want the biggest bang for your buck, you'd probably be better sticking with The Monthly releases of the 8th Doctor. They cost a little more than the New 8th Doctor Adventures, but are quite a bit longer(About an hour and a half, I believe, compared to about half an hour for the 8th Doctor Adventures set).

If you decide to go this route, start with Storm Warning, and go from there.

[Here's a list of the monthly sets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_audio_plays_by_Big_Finish#Monthly_releases). Easiest way to navigate the list is just look for the stories involving the 8th Doctor, which you can find to the right of the titles. Each Doctor has their own separate story, so don't feel intimidated that there are other Doctor stories in between each other, as they all have their own separate stories.

If you want to start with the 8th Doctor Adventures, which are a little shorter/cheaper than the monthly sets, but have a stronger overall arch, then start from the beginning with Blood of the Daleks.

**TL;DR**

There are two sets of possible adventures to start off with, each with their own companion. The monthly series stars Charlie Pollard, an Edwardian era companion, is a little more expensive, but a little longer in length per episode. The other set is the New 8th Doctor Adventures which star Lucie Miller, a 21st century girl very akin to Donna Noble, but in my opinion tons better(She's not as dimwitted, and much more toned down in the yelling compartment), the stories are a tad shorter, but cost a few dollars less to buy.

Personally, I'd go with the New 8th Doctor adventures, just because I've fallen in love with Lucie Miller(And if the idea that she's like Donna Noble puts you off, keep in mind that I'm not the biggest fan of Donna, but love Lucie).

Possible alternative: purchase Storm Warning *and* Blood of the Daleks, and see which you would like to listen to. Be forewarned, it will be a hard decision to make.",0,1344139018,null,0,false,0,c5od25l,t3_xok76,t1_c5od25l,t1_c5ocszg,null,1429555720,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

In fact, the TARDIS receives the signal from *every time* the Doctor has pressed that button, and receives them all at once.  (When you're outside time, everything happens all at once.)  There would have to be some protocol worked out so that the TARDIS could figure out which of those signals it was supposed to home in on.  Maybe a subjective time counter built into the signal so the TARDIS would know which was the ""most recent"" signal.

Mind you, there could also be a non-time-travel version, which just calls the TARDIS to his location from across town, or from a planet to a spaceship, et cetera.  Just space, not time.

The real problem with the Doctor being able to summon the TARDIS at will is that no future writer would ever be able to do a story in which the Doctor was stuck someplace and had to use his wits to get out.  No threat could ever seem serious because he'd always have an easy escape route.

There is no reason to group the last three Doctors together and the first eight together and no reason to think that anyone else would just because you want to.

Sorry, if you're not familiar with the names of the older Doctors, maybe that was why it sounded confusing - but I was pointing out that the same amount of time elapsed between 1-7 as 7-9.  Why group 7 with 1, but not with 9?  8 is way closer to 9, and even closer to 11 than to 1.  Why group 8 with 1-7, but not with 9-11?

There are at least as many differences going from 1-4 as 8-11.

You are correct that people do not start on a level playing field - economically.

But there's no correlation between *values* and *wealth*.

You use the false believe that ""the poor cannot have values"" to openly permit them to commit crime and behave in an anti-social manner.

&gt; If you grow up poor, your parents don't give a shit, and the police stop and search you just because, you're not going to have the same values.

If your parents don't give a shit then that's a genuine problem. It's sad they brought you into this world in the first place. Take your anger out on them. Meanwhile do everything you can to prevent another child going through what you did - especially your own children!

People don't stop and search people ""because they are poor"". When you walk down the street everyone can tell who is dressing anti-socially. Who is hiding their face with hoodies. Who is letting their underpants hang out on show. Who hasn't bothered washing for a few days. Who is hanging around in groups of young males instead of being their own man.

Police notice the obvious signs - too. We all have a choice - bait the police - or be respectable citizens.

By the way - acting anti-socially and then claiming that it is ""black culture"" (with the rights that go with such a claim) is one of the most offensive things anybody can say. When that kind of claim is made the claimant is effectively accusing all black people of being disrespectful shits. That's unfair on blacks. And incredibly racist.

&gt; ""Law Abiding Citizen"" lol FUCK off, you'd be the same as the rioters if you grew up in their position, you're not better than them, you're just luckier.

Everybody has choices. Everybody. E-ver-ee-body.

Life is a mix of choice and luck.

* bad choices and bad luck - tragedy
* bad choices and good luck - average life
* good choices and bad luck - average life
* good choices and good luck - triumph

true,nowonmai666,lfc99,null,"The English media seem to want to apply ""tiki-taka"" to any team that can play more than three passes in a row without launching the ball up into the stands. That makes the word useless.

I always thought that ""Tiki-Taka"" used to mean a particular approach to the short passing game: the metronomic rhythmic passing that Barcelona used a couple of seasons back *but not so much in 2011-2012*. Spain's game in Euro 2012 was certainly not tiki-taka.

If you look at Barcelona a couple of years back they made a *lot* more sideways passes than they do now. You'd have Puyol standing 3m away from another defender, and they's still be passing it back and forth on the beat, maybe 5 or 6 times. It was hypnotic, and I often felt I couldn't quite see how they'd managed to get from there to Iniesta and Messi playing one-twos on the same beat in the opponent's penalty area. The opposing players certainly couldn't.

*That*, to me, is tiki-taka, a form of football-art that only Barcelona have achieved, and even then for only a couple of seasons. Last season they were a little more direct; more of their passes were forward and the religious adherence to the rhythm was gone. It was still a game built on pressing, possession and quick short passes, but not quite the same.

So by that definition, Liverpool under Rodgers will not be playing tiki-taka any time soon; in fact, almost definitely never.

Now can you see from these two graphs that this Osborne fella's financial policies are clearly harming British growth. From 2011 onwards we have trailed the eurozone on growth. Our economy is in fact weakening. 

Even the IMF have had to have needed to advise Osborne that his strategy is rubbish. 

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/christine-lagarde-time-is-running-out-for-george-osbornes-plan-a-7778893.html

It is actually clear that we would actually have been better off within the eurozone because it consistently performs better than our own economy.

However the longer our growth remains on a downward trend the easier it is for the conservatives to sell the doom and gloom position from which they sell off the NHS, grant tax cuts to the rich and attack the weakest members of our society. 

and with regards that aaa credit rating, every ratings agency views that valuation as negative, in other words they expect us to lose the rating in the long term

&gt; Disabled people being driven into poverty? I know there's reform in the system to try and weed out non-genuine cases, or to get disabled people who CAN work back into work. But any actual figures (i.e. no newspaper stories) to back your claim up?

and of course you forget to mention the freeze in the minimum wage for young people which is effectively a cut since inflation will eat into that and of course it ignores the fact that youth unemployment has grown to record heights under the conservatives. 

&gt; NHS being destroyed - again, no evidence of that. 

Are you living under a rock? an actual troll?

Do you even realise that by directing money out of the NHS as the libcons plan to do they will starve it of funds and force it into an early demise. They are forcing privatisation through the back door. There is a very clear strategy at work. It isn't a managed strategy like you find on the mainland, where most employed people buy insurance and there is a safety net for the low paid. It is nothing more than a complete shambles.

You got that right. Things are far from perfect. In fact things look pretty dreadful for this country unless we get decision makers in who are not weakening our economy.  Decision makers who aren't taking decisions based on political mantra and are willing to listen to economic experts who have been consistently telling them you are getting it wrong. But our Bullingdon  boys are far too arrogant to listen and change course. A bunch of toffs who have lived in a bubble. Maybe they can create some more fuel strikes to save the economy or get a load of corrupt advisers in to advise them.

true,OptioMkIX,null,null,"&gt;But again, the NHS got an £500m INCREASE in spending compared to last year. They were supposed to get £900m, so I suppose you could call it a ""cut"" or probably a ""freeze"" if you take inflation and population into account. Either way, the idea of the NHS being starved of funds is total nonsense, though that doesn't stop newspapers writing about the cuts killing our children and grandmothers.

It does count as a cut solely on the basis of inflation, more so now that more services are being folded into the NHS budget.

&gt;There is zero evidence that patient care has suffered. As for ""forcing privatisation"", I seem to remember that PFI was something the Labour government pushed with full force, and now we are paying dearly for it.

&gt; As men say that grey hair looks 'distinguished' 

Right now I'd be happy with hair of any colour.  All mine fell out over the course of a few months earlier this year.  Not sure why, but it happened around the same time that an old skateboarding injury flared up leading to a lymphedema and cellulitis (your region of expertise, I imagine).  The best guess is that my immune system was going a bit apeshit and decided my hair follicles were the enemy, but I get the impression that it's just one of those things that happens sometimes, no-one really knows why and there's not much you can do about it.  Ho hum.

So having recently joined the ranks of the slapheads, I'm not really in any position to pass comment on the colour of your hair, but I'm sure it looks lovely.  :-)  Mine look like it's starting to grow back but completely white, so that could give me some interesting dying possibilities...

It's neither FTP nor torrent but another protocol called Direct Connect. It's what it says on the box: you've got a list of people on the network, you can view their file library and directly connect to their computer to download stuff off of them, since this is run via the University local network you can get upwards of 10MB/s, which is really nice. To join in all you have to do is have a computer and a College-provided internet access (not sure how well it works in town houses, see later), download the program, run it and tell it which folders (music folders, TV folders etc) you want to share with the network, there's no uploading involved until the point where someone wants things you have on your hard-drive, it sweeps folders you designated and build a little list of what you want to share on your computer.  

   Note that you can't download anything unless you have at least 100MB shared (or something like that), this is sometimes source of confusion. The search function for the client often works badly, you're more likely to get what you want by digging into the file lists of people with large libraries.

You can do clever stuff with VPNs on computers in the SRCF but otherwise that's the only restriction.

I understand you not liking the Classic series for whatever reason: pacing, production values, etc. but you're simply wrong about no story arc. The older series does have a progression, character development, and even some season long arcs that told a single story: Key to Time, Trial of a Time Lord, etc. The revival series hasn't had season long story arcs every season either.

I think one way to look at this is like a friendship. Say you and your friend Mary Jane have known each other since you both started working together six years ago. You get along great together, and you have just so much in common. I also know Mary Jane. But I went to school with her in grade school, middle school and high school. When she went away to college we kept in touch with phone calls and email. Now that she and I live together in the same city, we've picked up that friendship where it left off, and I love the changes in her, how mature she's become and who she is today. Does that make me a better friend than you? No, but it does mean I've known her longer. Does it mean you don't really count because you weren't there the whole time? No, because you guys are friends, real friends, and it's all good. I love Mary Jane, I want her to be happy. The more friends she has the better. BUT, it doesn't mean that it's okay for you to be pissy any time I say ""Oh my gosh, MJ! Do you remember that time that we pranked the principle at homecoming?"".

But you seem to be suggesting that someone slapping their boyfriend (or girlfriend) once should be treated the same as constant violence.

I'd say that was a pretty good guess, sometimes it does just happen, the immune system has its own agenda and does it's job rather too well.

It's worse, yes, I agree.

&gt;Do you disagree with that?

What I disagree with is writing off female on male violence as just the odd woman slapping a man.

&gt;If a man is getting beaten by his girlfriend daily, that should be treated the same as a women getting beaten by her boyfriend daily.

Agreed completely, but hhmmmm makes out like domestic violence against men is just the odd slap here and there, and so dismisses the OP's point that ""national"" domestic violence helplines should be available to all genders, not just women. I supported what I had to say with a link to a study (and I can link plenty more if wanted) and a couple of easily readable articles. He pulls assertions out of his ass that accord with the hivemind's impressions.

&gt;But you seem to be suggesting that someone slapping their boyfriend (or girlfriend) once should be treated the same as constant violence.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; Hopefully yours should calm down now, at least you don't have to worry about the earbeards for while :-)

Alas, no.  All the other hair on my body seems to have gone into overdrive - eyebrows especially!  Fortunately I have recently purchased a rather nifty set of nose/ear hair clippers. 

&gt; Men sport the bald head rather well, it is a sexy look depending on the man of course.

I have been told that it suits me, but only by close friends who would lie to spare my feelings :-).  Here's my [before / after artist's impression](http://i.imgur.com/yD94T.jpg).

I must admit, it doesn't really bother me that much.  It's quite usual for men to be bald either by choice or genetics so no-one really bats an eyelid (except for those casual acquaintances who know me well enough to know that I lost my hair suddenly, but don't know me well enough to ask if I've got cancer).  I can imagine it's much harder for  women to come to terms with.  The worst bit is having to shave my head every day to deal with the tufts of hair that stubbornly refuse to fall out.  Otherwise I look like a half-finished jigsaw.

Stop worrying about the athletes - they don't need you to worry about them. Just try and appreciate that they're doing what they do out of choice, not compulsion. Putting in a lot of effort tires you out, but you recover after having a rest.

You're right to point out that we've been linked concretely to very few targets, but my question is, why is that? This striker problem has been well known for two years and critical for a year. During that time any NUMBER of strikers have been purchased by Premier League teams - did we bid for any of them? Were we in for Podolski? Giroud? Papiss Cisse? Hell, even Jelavic? All went for prices we could have easily afforded, and at least two would have clearly been worthy purchases for us. Did we try? If not, why not? How many other good targets went to other clubs while we continued our two-year association with a Brazilian whose price we're obviously not prepared to meet, settling for loanees and six months of Louis Saha? How much longer is that going to go on?

And what about past targets we're apparently no longer in for? Supposedly we no longer want Remy. Why not? Do we want Sturridge? If so, why haven't we made a bid? And these are just the targets I know. I'd never heard of Papiss Cisse before Newcastle bought him, but he was there in the Bundesliga for all to see. Why didn't we?

I have no inside knowledge, there might very well be good answers to some of these questions. I ask them only to illustrate that there are always good strikers on the market, and it's only if you look exclusively at Llorentes and the like that ""rare and expensive"" becomes a legitimate tag. And if we're not willing to pay for a Llorente, as it seems to me we're not, shopping for the perfectly respectable second tier of strikers should not take years.

My point still stands though. The pressure on themselves to succeed is multiplied by the pressure to not disappoint their nation when the games begin and the public suddenly take an interest in their actions. If one fails, they feel additional disappointment themselves. They may have been thinking only for their own determination up until they enter the arena. They look around and see the home crowd, watching, and it'll dawn on them, ""There's a lot of pride riding on this"". It's a shock, a rush and many react well, many react with indifference, some might flake out. But the outcome will always be the same, Success - joy multiplied with the rest of the nation, Failure - sadness multiplied by the disappointment of the nation.

Why? Because the moaning British public convinced themselves that it wasn't worth bothering. The regular holiday makers have all phoned up to cancel and many have decided to leave rather than stay and enjoy this once in a lifetime opportunity. Is it not hard to put up with 2 Summer months of Olympic games? Why were we so pessimistic from the start?

I've not had to wake up an extra hour earlier in order to get to where I want to be on time when taking public transport. I've been to Heathrow twice to pick up relatives and it wasn't choc-o-bloc on either occasion as predicted.

We blew everything out of fucking proportion and now our own businesses are suffering in a time where we should of prospered both in national pride as well as economically. I've had a great time this Olympics but I've also been let down by the British public. We should be ashamed of ourselves.

Yeah, that's kind of my feeling as well.  I feel like all of our transfer dealings take place in this limbo where we overlook good targets because they're somehow ""not good enough for Spurs"", but then when a target comes along who's *clearly* good enough we're unwilling to spend the money.  I have my doubts about Podolski but I'd have loved Giroud, I'd have loved Cisse, Jelavic would have been better than a sharp stick in the eye, and I still think Remy should be a target.  At a certain point, unless you're buying Sergio Aguero or some other sure-thing, any expensive transfer is some kind of risk.  If we're not willing to take those, I'm not sure why we sold all our strikers.

I do have my doubts about our scouting also.  When was the last time you heard us connected to some brilliant transfer prospect everybody didn't already know about?

If you don't have a machine, get a straight-edge (read: ruler) and Sharpie on the window frames.  Then handstitch it to the dress.

If you have a machine, run a black/brown satin stitch for them.

##### 3. ""Police Public Call Box"" label

Buy press-on letters from the fabric store.

Acquire black fabric and cut out a large rectangle to put the letters on.  Iron on the letters.

Sew the rectangle onto the top.

Our current squad isn't suited for a long-term competitions such as the EPL and it showed last season; however, we may be able to make a few good cup runs like last year. 


I also think that this season may determine Luis Suarez's future at Anfield. He is an amazing player who may decide to leave if we cannot secure CL football; given that that itself is unlikely we may have to sell. Our best players (Agger, Skrtel etc) may also be on the way out depending on this season.

To expand on what oag721 said, what we now call an episode or a story from the classic series was originally broadcast in serialized form.  So for example, the first Doctor Who story or episode first aired as four 25 minute episodes on four consecutive weeks.  When you watch a classic story either on DVD or streaming video, you'll see it divided up into ""Part One"" et cetera, with cliffhangers at the end of each episode.  But each of those stories is mostly stand alone.  

There's continuity running through the series -- companions leave and are replaced by new ones, or sometimes a new story will begin with the characters mentioning the events of the previous story.  But it's not usually necessary to have seen a preceding story to understand a current one.  They didn't do year-long ""story arcs"" in the early days the way they do now.  (The classic series experimented with that idea a couple of times in later years, but only in special cases.)

There are often threads here devoted to ""which episodes of the classic show should I watch"" and the answers are always changing.  Everyone should watch the very first story ""An Unearthly Child"" and probably ""The Daleks"" as well, but after that it's perfectly good to sample whatever piques your curiosity, going back to fill in the gaps later if you want.

He did make some horrendous mistakes, but he brought in some of the best players we've ever had, won us more trophies than the last 3 managers did combined and landed us 4 points from the top of the prem.

I also dont think our youth players are loyal anymoree, they are too interested in fame and money. Unlike Stevie and Carra who play for the club I can see players like Sterling and Suso leaving us for quicker action in a first XI

I also think we need a new stadium, its is LONG overdue, if we dont sort it out soon we will be left behind

true,ksturgis,null,null,"&gt; Drogba was struggling as well and so both of them had as much claim to the starting spot as the other.

This is a significant point, because again, the entire point of spending 50m on Torres was the idea that he would become our #1 striker. There was no reason to swap Drogba in and out with him as it was only counter productive, and clearly affected Torres' confidence and productivity. Without a doubt I'm of the opinion that AVB mismanaged Torres and ultimately made it harder for him to find consistent form. 

I completely agree that there is a level of blind allegiance to Torres, but there is also a fair amount of unreasonable criticism toward his production (or lack thereof) due to the fact that the cards have been stacked against him since his arrival. Until I see Torres play a few months with consistent starts and ample support behind him, will I be ready to make a fair judgement on whether or not he's capable of being our top striker. And everyone else should work toward such a reasonable conclusion as well. Besides, let's face it. Our club (and its supporters) are among the best at passing quick judgement on talent and ruling that ""he's not good enough, we should go out and buy someone better!"" We can't continue to make rash conclusions and spend tons of cash in an attempt to reconcile.

* both are enabled by corporate sponsorship;
* both entail the worship of winners, and the demonisation (or self deprecation) of the losers or those that break the rules;
* both focus on physicality, overt politics and intellectual discourse are suppressed and undesirable;
* both have rapid turnover of faces;
* both share the same agents;
* both have a disposable product (broken footballers are discarded young) whilst the various institutions remain intact;
* both are heavily dependent on intellectual property rights;
* both are a spectator sport;
* both wouldn't sit so heavily in the culture without centralised media promoting content;
* both are dependent on the school system (one out of failure, the other out of promotion).

My thoughts: people pay attention to things that people think are popular. TV and print can give a completely skewed sense of what is or what should be, whilst elevating people beyond merit. It explains why young girls paint their faces orange, hair bleaching trends, skin bleaching trends, and the dreadful state of politics.

Probably because they didn't announce it.

Here's what I said about it from another thread:

No one knows for sure. We've had no exact indication.

Some say 25th this month. This is due to the BFI showing and the fact Matt has said August at the Comic Con panel.

Others say later. This is because by now, we usually have a more exact indication if it were 25th. And because the trailer states Autumn (of which August is not).

I reckon it will be the 1st of September personally. Maybe stretch that to 8th. This is because there is no indication of it being shown on BBC America's schedule and theres a Series 6 marathon on Saturday 1st September. There is a gap between 8pms showing of TDTWATW (the latest episode) and 10pm. So it looks like it may be at 9pm. Seems late but the previous season aired around then.

There's 5 episodes and the DVD/Bluray is being released 12th of November, so it must at least start during September.

So all in all, My estimate is the either 1st or the 8th of September.",0,1344198426,null,0,1344200010,0,c5omn2p,t3_xq513,t1_c5omn2p,t3_xq513,null,1429560299,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Let's not forget that New Labour pioneered this degree of government by press release, and got into power by running an extraordinarily well oiled media operation against John Major. Whose major legacy reputation is as a grey man who wears large, square glasses and underpants outside his trousers, even though he came from an interesting and underprivileged background, and with an exceptional record on economic growth and unemployment.

The problem is that most politically engaged people in this country are outraged by these infractions when the other side does something, but not when their side repeats the favour. The really unpalatable truth is the good guys aren't concentrated in your favoured party, but are mixed in, along with the mercenaries, the narcissists, the bullies and the incompetents, in all major political parties.

The only way around this is if the public debate becomes sufficiently depolarized so that Tory, Labour and Lib Dem supporters and politicians can collaborate to decide on policies which are not just in their own ideological interests, but in the shared interests of the nation and of the population. And the second unpalatable truth is that politicians are already further along with this than the population. They try to keep up their punch and judy facade for the tabloids, but there's no left and right when it's six thirty in the afternoon in the Commons, and the discussion is about subsection b of the agriculture bill, dealing with egg standardization. On this topic, there is no drama, and there are things which are sensible, and things which are not.

I genuinely believe Liverpool have the quality to challenge for the top four; they just need some consistency.

I think Stewart Downing is a good player. Not a great player, not worth 20m, but he was incredibly unlucky last year and has real talent. And no, I am not just saying this in the aftermath of his goal Thursday.

Chelsea's spending sprees piss me off to no end, but I'm strangely unperturbed by Man City's.

I feel that Gerrard will struggle to fit into the team this year, at least for the beginning of the season. Watching him play against Tottenham and Gomel, he just attempted way too many long balls to nowhere. I'd almost rather see a midfield of Lucas-Allen-Hendo, assuming we get Allen. That said, I think Gerrard will make the adjustment to BR. I hope he does, at any rate.

I don't hate Everton. Yes, I'm American, surprise, surprise.

I heard on BBC five live that for Allen it was 8 then 12 then 15, 18 then I heard Swansea wanted 20 but I think we might have said no way, so they might have lowered it since then.

For some managers, buying a 9m winger from AZ Alkamaar, Espanyol, Deportivo La Caruna, Zenit, Brondby, etc. represents a bigger risk than the guy he's previously managed and knows is ""pretty good"". Rafa was willing to take those risks.  He plucked guys like Arbeloa, Alonso, Agger, Skrtel, and Riera from those teams. He also was able to convince them to come, (which was surely easier before Manchester City came along).

So while Scouts can give BR a list of highly rated players, he has to take on the risk and make the decisions for his own team.

The Lannisters are a bit like marmite, you either love them or hate them. However in the context of the Olympic games this logo is amazing. It suggests unity, the crowd support (the roar of the British crowds) and the power of British athletes.

This all links in with the English football teams three lions on the shirt and the various uses of the image of the lion for the UK, amongst the coat of arms and royalty symbolism.

Allen first, Liverpool pay 15-18 million for a young British midfield talent, sound familiar?

What gets me most is that previously we picked up Lucas has a poor first season an takes a lot of stick. Then we go for Henderson. I would be overjoyed if he turns out anyway near as effective as Lucas next season, skeptical as he's not adjusting to an unfamiliar league. Lucas was way under half his price, What's going on? Our foreign scouts prove their worth for once and then we disregard the precedent.
  Allen seems a good player but let's not kid ourselves he'd be a head scratcher at plus 12million.

Now as for replacing Agger or Skrtel I've no faith in our ability to pick out a replacement in the remainder of the close season. I'd be looking at huge money for them and only if they put in a transfer request. Our squad is seriously full of holes wide and up top now we want to pick at threads in defense?

However, at the centre of it all you will always find the military, royalty (or obfuscated royalty), and monetary systems.

&gt; It's not just a matter of the press telling people what to think

You should read the dailymail or thesun more often. I'll give you a few very specific examples. There was never any debate regarding whether we should have cuts, instead the media went straight to what to cut. (That's a clear case of divide and conquer.) The Iraq war was thoroughly championed even by the Guardian. Bin Laden's death has never been adequately followed up beyond the cheer-fest. Public opinion has been manufactured very specifically for Assange. Take (nearly) any article on police violence by the BBC and look at the language, then take a similar one about riots. The BBC has been screened for communists and other political dissidents as recently as the 80s by the secret services. If you only pick from a whitelist you will get a particular behaviour by default. I suppose when the system fails you get the super injunction. (A playful aside: Rooney? A role model?) I don't think the BBC had much to say on Bahrain (F1 conflict of interest), nor have I seen them challenge what it means to have a drone kill a militant.

I just had a look a the origins of the BBC. It was a partnership of sorts between some of the richest companies at the time: eg Marconi, General Electric; it appears the US navy had a say in things as well. It was later brought under control with the royal charter. If the collective powers can carry out biological and chemical testing in secret on the general populations (70s/80s), or orchestrate millions of soldiers to war (twice), I don't see why that hasn't been designed into the publishing system. The answer lies in being able to beat publishers reliant on advertising with the threat of pulling revenue (that also prompts to self censorship), the military and journalists like to scratch each other's backs (the former can take a way access to information for those badly behaved).

The first publisher to actually do real journalism outside the establishment was Wikileaks and they have been crushed. Conspiracies exist, and there are rooms where people do get together and talk about how to push narratives. Admittedly I'm still looking for the smoking gun, but perhaps I can't see it for all the smoke. I don't think you can continually propagate war or hold a population in a sense of economic and social turmoil without some serious deliberate psychological operations.

&gt;The first publisher to actually do real journalism outside the establishment was Wikileaks and they have been crushed. Conspiracies exist, and there are rooms where people do get together and talk about how to push narratives. Admittedly I'm still looking for the smoking gun, but perhaps I can't see it for all the smoke. I don't think you can continually propagate war or hold a population in a sense of economic and social turmoil without some serious deliberate psychological operations.

lolwut? I'll try to articulate a proper discussion on this matter because I kinda agree in that 'stuff' which isn't facilitated by some Bourgeois (For want of a less archaic nomenclature, but, shit..it fits) overlord, then perhaps 'leak' culture, is  the first venture into non-partisan territory...

I hated Rafa for the amount of money spent in the Robbie Keane fiasco. Especially all the money that was donated to Tottenham's charity to shut them up during their constant whining. It was a fucking embarrassment and the biggest waste of time.

I'm sorta tired of Carra and think he should hang the boots up soon.

I miss Merieles.

Lastly ever since the club lost Alonso, Arbeloa, and there seemed to be some shaky ground in the 09/10 season(dropping out of CL like flies, etc) I knew that it would require LFC about 4-5 seasons to get back in serious shape.

I believe your points were sell them to a team such as barca o real Madrid as they are not young and a peak value. I have heard rumours of a plus 15mil bid from city only.

I believe them to be approaching their peak value and have not yet reached their full potential.

27 is not old for a defender, see Rio Ferd, Terry, Maldini or a range of even midfield talent for evidence.

Furthermore a destroyer playmaker duo of that age is hugely rare and valuable.

I consider our defense to be our one area of top form last season, quite why any Liverpool fan is not stabbing pins in a miniature doll of Mancini whilst clamping a tear soaked pillow to their chest at the thought of them leaving is a source of concern to me.

Now we may agree to disagree on these points although I can't see why.

&gt; The important thing is the hours - as soon as you work 16 hours or more your JSA will stop. £5 will be disregarded then the rest taken £ for £ from JSA. If you are below the tax threshold you won't pay tax or can claim it back.

and also:

&gt;As I understand it if you earn under JSA amount then £5 of it would not be counted so you would be £5 better off from JSA, but once you are earning more than JSA amount there is no JSA so the whole lot is taken off and you would be better off by the amount you have earned.

Depends on how much you earn for the hours, how many there are etc... You need to sit down with pen, paper and pay slips and JSA payments and total it all up.  ""Being crap at it"" isnt really an excuse :)

This doesn't cover normal reporting from wars - there's a specific defense for the purposes of education. Hence, the BBC can show deeply unpleasant and unsettling images in news reports. They quite regularly show the civilians massacred in Syria, and I recall media controversy over showing a dead child in Gaza. Documentaries have also shown soldiers being shot. The Act probably would cover actually showing someone being dismembered or mutilated. This might mean broadcasting the beheading of a hostage in the Middle East, for example.


&gt;Fisting

This is quite heavily discussed in numerous cases, actually. Not just in the context of obscenity either. There are a number of deeply unfortunate cases where people have been seriously injured or killed during fisting or other 'extreme' insertions. But it was found only a few months ago that fisting is not obscene in the context of pornography - R v Peacock. The jury took the commendably short time of less than two hours to work that one out.

So they play the three biggest things they know Americans will like, Top Gear, Doctor Who, and Gordon Ramsay. Everything else is largely filler to get American audiences watching the station.

I partially wish it would get a larger audience of people watching it so we could get more stuff showing, but I partially don't. Every time I've seen a small station like BBCA grow and expand, it usually turns out for the rest. Instead of playing a few good shows all the time, they end up ditching a few of those good shows altogether and replace them for stuff that is not noteworthy in the least.

I think another issue is licensing. The BBC has licensed quite a bit of their stuff out to other American stations before creating the BBCA. So there are also quite a few shows that they couldn't show even if they wanted to.

On the subject of original shows, I ended up liking Richard Hammond's Crash Course more than I initially thought, so I'm holding out judgement for Copper. In the long run, I think turning the station into a little more of 'British actors making American television' would be better than slamming the station with a bunch of BBC's C and D list TV shows.",0,1344217175,null,0,false,0,c5oqvuo,t3_xqmfh,t1_c5oqvuo,t1_c5oqn0n,null,1429562365,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"I'm actually excited for Elementary, and I think the sooner people stop trying to claim it's an American remake of Sherlock, the better :p. The real reason why we don't get Sherlock on BBCA is because PBS holds the American rights to the show(As they should, they're actually co-producers with BBC). So if you want to watch Sherlock on American TV, it's off to PBS, because they're the ones that air it here. I believe Red Dwarf is also held by one of the national TV stations, I want to say Universal/NBC owns the licensing rights in the United States. And that's not even getting into stuff like, as you suggested, James May's Toy Stories which isn't even produced by the BBC, meaning someone else entirely owns the rights in the UK.

That's the world we live in, though. It's a lot more complicated of a situation than,""Well, they should just play my favorite shows,"" because they don't necessarily own the rights to said shows. I could be wrong on this one, but I believe PBS still owns licensing rights over Classic Who in America, which is why we never get that here on BBCA, as well.

On a last note, I'd give Elementary a chance. I'm just saying that as I'm fairly excited for it. This is coming from someone who is a Sherlock Holmes fan first, and a Sherlock fan second. People just need to stop comparing it to Sherlock, because it has nothing to do with it, and is in no way supposed to be like it. And, believe it or not, is NBC's third attempt at a modernized Sherlock Holmes story, all with female Watsons.

I sincerely wished it would be him who leads us back into prominence.  

That said, I fully support BR and honestly believe that he can and will be very successful at Liverpool.  As sad as it was to see Kenny go, I feel like it's crucial to really support Brendan Rodgers in his efforts at the club.

true,ChicoLatino7575,tardis,TARDIS,"I think that multi-season plot lines are quite brilliant simply because complexity that goes into writing the plots, how exciting it is to have the suspense for watching the conclusion to these plot lines, and being able to rewatch certain episodes to pick up on some foreshadowing and hints you may have overseen before. It also shows the determination of the writers to actually be able to form these plot lines over long periods of time using the time travel in their show to their advantage to manipulate the course(s) of certain people's time lines in the series (ex. River and the Doctor meeting up in the wrong order) to make these ridiculous plot lines work and make sense.

I have found certain subtle occurrences of expanded plot lines (not necessarily over several seasons) in the writing for the first four seasons: Eccleston taking down Satellite 5 and unknowingly halting the progress of the world which he comes back to solve at the end of the season. The idea that the Doctor and Donna were destine to meet to be together long enough for a human-time lord meta crisis to occur at the end of that season and the same idea continuing with Donna's grandfather Wilfred being destined to have found the Doctor [spoiler](#s ""so that Wilfred would eventually bring Tennant to his inevitable death"") when the Master returns after a full season and his actions, resurrection, and the drum beat finally explain.

Also, it's difficult to avoid this style of writing when you're dealing with a time traveler [spoiler](#s ""and his wife who doesn't travel with him all the time"") because events in his life are bound to cross not directly (as if he accidentally meets himself), but as if he crosses to events that endanger him and are not of his fault but of the fault of his future self, for example in the ""Shakespeare's Code"" Tennant finds himself an enemy of the current queen of England, having no idea why, he suspects that he will soon find out in his future. Another example is how the universe first got the word ""doctor"" from the Doctor even though he named himself AFTER the word ""doctor"" (this is said in ""A Good Man Goes to War"").

Xabi was overrated, and while he is a talented player he did not fit as well into Rafa's system once we incorporated more dynamic players such as Torres, Benayoun, Dirk, Gerrard, and Riera.

It makes sense to establish some sort of identifying feature for posts about the current season (unless I am miss-understanding and the conversation is that there should be no posts about the current season?), to the extent that if, for example, a post is talking about an episode, that should be identified in the title; this way people who have seen the episode can all gush/rant together, and people who have not seen the episode (if they don't want to read anything about it) will know to avoid that post. Otherwise, as altrocks pointed out, the seasons and movies and whatnot have been out there and will continue to be out there, it is impossible to cover all possible things that can be spoiled and it's not the job of this subredit to do that. It's intended to be a space for people who are long time enthusiasts or new enthusiasts (such as myself) to share and be enthusiastic together ;D In addition, it is my responsibility to be mindful when I click into posts; part of the onus to avoid spoilage is on me, to move through this subreadit with eyes open. Granted if a post title just says ""bowties"" but the post contains information that is a potential spoiler to someone who has not seen every episode, then that post-creator needs to learn to appropriately title his or her posts in a way that readers can determine if it's a post to steer clear of or not. 
Going back to the original post, I think you have the right idea. Identification for posts about specific episodes, people need to tread carefully. Maybe add something somewhere that has guidelines for titling posts?

The average person can't relate to somebody who has spent their life in pursuit of perfection in a given field. They don't want to read about that unless there's a particular reason for it (e.g. they just won a gold medal for Great Britain). They want to hear about some average Joe who's just like them, who managed to milk some fame and money from reality TV either by showing off what meagre talent they have that shallow fucks wouldn't expect just from looking at them (archetype: Susan Boyle), or from humiliating themselves by displaying their ignorant or shallow nature to the world (archetype: Jade Goody). They want to hear about celebrities doing and saying stupid things, so they can bring them down to their own level. They want to read about pampered footballers spitroasting slags and driving fast cars, because to a lot of people, they're living the dream. There's a reason why most people can name 5 members of the *Jersey Shore* cast or the last 5 *X Factor* winners, but would be unable to name 5 Nobel Prize winners.

There's a reason why celebrity gossip pervades every tabloid newspaper - it's what the people want. Not all the people, but most of them; enough to sell a metric fuckton of newspapers - and that there is what the papers want. Everybody wins.

If he can't be bothered to read a 78 page book available everywhere, we can hardly expect him to dive  back into his own notes from 3 years ago, I suppose.

But then sometimes he'll pull a 'Blink' or a 'Lady in the Fireplace' out of somewhere and it's stunning in its perfection.

1) Many American Spurs fans have a tendency to wrongly call Spurs ""the Spurs"", as in ""the Bears"" or ""the Vikings"", etc. From my experience, non-American Spurs supporters hate when Americans make this mistake. Stick with ""Tottenham"", ""Tottenham Hotspur"", or ""Spurs"".

2) The h in Tottenham is silent. It is pronounced tot-n-um or even tot-num.

3) If you are into reading and history, I would recommend reading The Glory Game by Hunter Davies. It gave me a good understanding on some of the legends and history of the club. I will lend you my own personal copy if you are interested.

He has adapted magnificently to a role which was left vulnerable by others leaving.

I'm not sure Lucas would be so terrible should he be put further up. I also think to say he was poor for two years is harsh. He made a few errors in televised games which seemed to generate this backlash. He was key in a number of games such as the win at Old Trafford 4-1.
