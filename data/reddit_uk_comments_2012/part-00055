So we got £63 Billion in tax receipts in 2010-11 however we bought £76 Billion of RBS/LLoyds shares in 2009 to stop the banks going bust...

And what was the cost of the bailout in 2008-09 to the govt? I think you'll find that if you add a zero onto the figure above you'll be somewhere close.

I think this entire thing is almost part of the human condition, as humans we are ""designed"" to want to live as long as we can and by extension we want everyone else to live as long as they can too. Therefore we define the quality of a society by the length of time people live for and design the law to maximize that.    

If people think *this* is extremely then clearly they have never seen the torture we put people through near the end of their lives instead of being able to just end it in quick and painless way (assisted suicide etc)...    

It really boils down to core questions of what kind of society we want to live in and what we value most.

* **1)**  Most importantly, the way he approached the situation was in an unprofessional manner.  He shouldn't have called you mate and should have been sensitve to the fact that he was calling you at work.  If he wanted to speak with you after work, he should have asked and arranged a time, not assumed that you had made a decision and called regardless.  If he worked on my team, he would be out on his ass.

* **2)** This will be unpopular - getting you mobile number under false pretenses is not a crime.  It is likely that a researcher/resource called your businesses pretending to be a client and asked a colleague (likely a PA or secretary) what you number is.  Although immoral, it happens.  It is not illegal unless they claim to be representing a public body or authority.  THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE YOU ARE HARD TO REACH AND THEY WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING THAT COULD BE BENEFICIAL TO BOTH OF YOU.

* **3)** Please, please, please feel good about this.  Retained executive search is not cheap - my minimum fees are £25,000, £8,500 of which is payable before I will even start writing a specification.  If a company is serious enough to use a service like the one I offer, it is because the role is of critical importance.  Your skills are in demand and very unlikely to be available on the job boards (Monster, CV Library , The Ladders etc.)

I am seeing a lot of hate in this thread from people that have zero idea about what we do.  Executive Search is as far away from basic recruitment as premier league football is away table football.  It's a long and complicated process that occasionally finds itself in some morally grey areas, but its a huge industry, generating billions in revenue each year.  

Did you see the job advert for the new CEO of XYZ Corp PLC? No? That’s because competitors can't know there may be a temporary weakness in an organisation, it can't be allowed to affect the share price and pretty often, the current CEO can't know that his days are numbered.

Think what you will about what we do - it's a necessary part of the economy.

This may not be a popular post, however please don't downvote this because you may not like the insight into the word of Executive Search I have given you.  Feel free to downvote if you think this if offensive or poorly written however. 

If anyone here has further questions, I would be more than happy to answer them.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I don't have an issue with us looking for a goalie in the summer, but i wouldn't make it a priority.  Lloris will cost a fair amount and i think our money would be better spent elsewhere.  Krul's price would be up because Newcastle is our competition and i think Vorm would end up getting priced higher than we would go.  If you can grab someone on the cheap as cover/future great but lets not break the bank on it.

Hopefully Vertongen is wrapped up sooner than later, at that point i think we may have to figure out if we keep Dawson or not since i don't think he will be happy being second fiddle full time.

I would love Javi Martinez but i think he will end up moving somewhere else, i have seen alot of rumors of him to ManU that may be nothing but just the rumor could be enough to drive the price higher than is warranted.

As for wing, we aren't going to get Hazard, he will cost just far too much and i think he is going to land in Man City with an enormous wage bill.  Try to get Krasic, he is desperate to get out of Juve, they would love to move him on since he doesn't fit in their game plan from what i can see.  May also look at Elerjo Elia who hasn't been able to get on the pitch for Juve but would provide the pace and threat that we could use to cover Bale or Lennon.

Hoilett i think is a must grab for us, i think we can grab him on a free and while he wouldn't necessarily be better than anyone we start he can play the support striker role as well as on the wing which would effectively give us cover for VDV, Bale and Lennon on the cheap.

Last i saw higuain was priced at around 35mil, we won't pay that for him so i think we could take him off the list. I could see the Llorrente attempt becoming complicated with other teams around europe and pricing us out. Giroud is looking at Bayern last i saw and it sounds like he could carry a pretty large fee, guessing we can take him off the list as well.

Remy and Damio i think should top the list i think the pricing could be around 16-20mil well within what we would pay for a striker and either would be an upgrade.

If we can land Ade for around 8 mil (provided City don't drive the price up) and he will play ball in terms of wage structure we should pull the trigger and keep him on.

At that point i think we should be able to get another lesser priced striker for cover.  One that i would be ok with (and i know i am very much in the minority)....i have seen a few stories where people cited Liverpool being ready to pull the plug on the Carroll experience and sell him at an extremely cut rate, if you can get him at 8-10mil i say take the chance, he has been crap for Liverpool but in our system he actually looks like the type of striker we could really utilize in our attack (big, strong, can hold up the ball has enough of a shot to be a bit of a threat).

After that i just hope we can stumble onto a bargain somewhere, there is always someone who gets sold for far less than anyone thinks hopefully we are positioned to capitalize on this.

true,hhmmmm,null,null,"&gt; Feminist groups have been banging on about the poor response by police to rape cases for ages now, highlighting the tiny number of cases which actually go trial. 

This figure, on its own is actually pretty meaningless, and interestingly no other crime has this figure published precisely because it is so meaningless so there isnt even a comparison figure. Very few of any crimes reported actually go to trial as the CPS need to believe there is a fair chance of getting a conviction. Conviction rate is more important (there it does fall down but it is around 50-60% with the average rate of all crimes being in the high 80%s).

On a wider point, there is no easy way to improve rape conviction rates, they've edged up but in 2 decades they've not made significant improvements in conviction rates despite it really being pushed as a goal both by the public and by the home office. They've made significant improvements in the way they handle cases but basically for the conviction rate of rape (most of which is in no way like this case) to go up significantly it would probably have to mean a significant reduction in the rights of the accused and innocent men going to jail. 

However more specifically I think this case is entirely different from the normal issues around the handling of rape cases (which have changed fundamentally) though, this is a much wider failing of the police/social services etc.

I would also have to say in fairness to the CPS they can only take to trial cases they reasonably believe they can win and deciding on what to prosecute and what not is entirely dependent on the case put in front of them by the police, if it isnt good enough and they know they wont win they wont waste money on the trial.

TL; DR:  Andy Carroll is a good player but if you can get a decent fee for him and need the money for an upgrade I would be willing to sell him because one good month is not enough to convince me.  Dream replacement:  Cavani or Dzeko; Realistic replacement:  Negrado, Giroud or Jovetic.  Players to shift Suarez forward and keep Carroll as situational player (not my ideal):  Giovinco, Remy, Dempsey

My scouting report on Andy that I have been updating as the season goes on:

* He's certainly looked faster since dropping some weight and getting match fit and he is very good controlling and directing passes with his head and, especially, his chest but his first touch with his feet is heavy.  This usually makes him more effective flicking on or directing passes with one touch than when he tries to control and turn when isolated.  This is why he looks better in 4-4-2 and pretty bad in 4-5-1 (For comparison Suarez is great at rolling defenders who get too tight when he is receiving a long ball so he can sometimes do the job as a lone striker).

* He is not a great offensive header of free kicks.  He gets to a decent number of headers in his zone but doesn't direct them as well as you would expect for someone who directs headers so well in the middle of the pitch.  This may be due to a lack of confidence or the fact that defenders seem to get away with murder against him in the box.  His reputation when coming to the club was that he was great at this.

* He is a great defender of set pieces.  He is good at getting around ""picks"" and attacks free kicks well when he doesn't have to worry about exactly where the clearance is going.

* In the run of attacking play when he is off the ball he gets oddly passive when entering the penalty area and often tries to pull away to the penalty spot instead of attacking the goal.  This means he is reacting to crosses in the air and can be blocked off by defenders and not quick enough to get to crosses on the ground.  This sometimes works if the weak side winger goes to the back-post and fills the space opened by defenders reacting to the ""big threat.""

* Once he gets turned and moving in space his footwork isn't bad but he is slow on the turn and generally requires an extra touch to get the ball out of his feet.

* His footwork has looked substantially better in the past two months in tight spaces (most notably in the Final but I think generally, too).

* With his left foot he has good accuracy and power but not great touch and you rarely see him even try to put curl on the ball.  This makes his crosses very direct but sometimes productive from on the left when he is in not directly in line with the attacking players.

* He rarely uses his right foot when in space so I don't have a read on how well he can really use it.  He had a few opportunities to use it in front of goal this season but seemed to lack confidence.  At that time in the season he was lacking confidence in just about everything, though, so I'm not sure if he will develop as a two-footed finisher.

* He is not a left-footed option from free kicks because he doesn't get enough action on the ball to curl or bring it down over a wall.  He could be used in set plays where they off-set the ball.  This is similar to how Riise used to take free kicks.

* In the last two months of the season, his performances have improved as the game goes on, likely because of the physical toll he takes on defenders.  He has been able to take more advantage of this as his fitness has improved.

* He is great at shielding the ball by the corner flag when killing off a game.

All that being said, I think he is a fine player as a situational option or coming off the bench.  If he is willing to accept that role and the club feels they can carry him for that role I am fine with that.  There would definitely be games where you want him to start and I think he is a great sub when protecting a one goal lead.

It's hard to say what he would be worth.  There are certainly teams in the Premiership that he would fit in with but I don't know how much money they have to spend.  He would be really good on certain teams in Ligue 1 or Serie A but English players never go abroad.  If you can get 17-18M for him I think you have to consider it, unless FSG is willing to net spend more than I expect.

Choosing an upgrade is a bit dependent on if you think Suarez is going to be your primary goal-scorer like he was at Ajax and for Urugauy.  I think he probably isn't so you want a primary striker who can play in a 4-3-3.  The obvious choices would be Cavani, Llorente or Dzeko, who I think are all powerful target men like Carroll but also more versatile and better on the ball.  They are also very expensive and may not want to move for a Europa League team.  On the cost front, you may need the money from sales to afford any of them if they would agree to come.  Higuain is a dream and would never come.  Roberto Soldado fell off as the season went on and is probably going to stay in Spain.  Alvaro Negrado, Olivier Giroud or Stevan Jovetic would all be viable options.  Luuk De Jong is a hot property but I usually don't trust single season scoring stats in the Eredivise.  Hulk has a funny name and is probably overpriced.

The other option is to focus the attack through Suarez and look for players who can score from wider areas.  If you go this route you probably have to keep Carroll and be strategic in picking your team.  Clint Dempsey has been mentioned a lot and could do this.  Sebastian Giovinco is small but extremely talented and would be great alongside Suarez.  Loic Remy is similar to Dempsey in that he starts wide but then scores a strangely high percentage of his goals with his head.",0,1336571948,null,0,true,0,c4lyk8b,t3_te4z5,t1_c4lyk8b,t1_c4lxphv,null,1428888982,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

But whereas his solution seems to be to do away with the whole idea, personally believe that reform of the system would make it into the institution it should be. Whereas his solution would make us lose out on the many benefits we receive from membership of the EU, whilst putting power firmly into a position from which he can reach it, reform would allow it to become a much better body at managing the framework we've laid out for increasing prosperity and peace in Europe.

true,cyborg_selkie,null,null,"So to further explain my previous post, I should note that I'm making the following assumptions about the pedos. One: most of them are from a developing world country where the idea of a civil society is irrelevant. Two: they see all women as sub-human, but treat said sub-humans in different ways depending on who they belong to. 

When you were a kid, your parents probably told you things like don't throw cash on the ground, wait your turn, don't pee on the street, etc. These are basically values that are necessary for a civil society to exist: you must be consider how your actions affect people you don't know, because we all want to live in a nice place. While there are wankers and lousy parents in every society, generally speaking, in most sensible first world countries people follow simple do-unto-other mores which make things run smoothly. 

In developing world countries, this often is not the case. You can't trust the state and you can't trust other people, so why bother being considerate of them? A side effect of a lack of civil society is that your family/personal connections matter a whole lot more. It's not that families in the developing world are loved more than families in the first world, it's that they're *needed* more. If you fuck them off, you have no one. No one wants to marry someone so horrible they fucked off their entire family (so good luck starting a new one) and no state is going to help you if you lose your job, get sick, or get old. So, to review: state, other people=who cares? family/clan/social network=uber care. 

Now, I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that these bastards don't see women as human. I'm also going to assume that they are Muslim, and that the two are connected. Now, in developing-world Muslim societies, women are important, but not necessarily important as human beings. They're important because the honor of the men in the family is connected to the purity of the women. A woman who has/is rumoured to have sex outside of marriage sullies the reputation of the men in the group. In a developing world society where family is important, this is a very bad thing. I'm not sure that the punishment of the man who caused the woman to lose her reputation would be as severe as punishment the woman would receive from her family, but it still wouldn't be a good idea. So while I don't think these men value women of any race as human beings, they wouldn't want to mess with women who come from families they have connections with. Also, these particular women are potential marriage material, and they wouldn't want to lower the supply of potential brides. For these men, trafficking women of their own culture would be like taking a flamethrower to a car before you buy it from the dealer. 

So women, in general, are objects to these people. Within their own community, they are valuable objects. But women of the greater civil society that you don't give half a shit about? Fair game. They don't give a toss about people who aren't in their network, they don't see women as human beings. So who cares if you're actions are disruptive, or bother people? Who cares if you make the girls sad? They do not matter.  

&gt;Stop making apologies for racists because the racists have brown skin.

I'm not apologising for anyone. You can explain why a psychopath doesn't feel empathy without arguing that it is acceptable. As an expat, I believe that if you move to a country you need to respect its culture and abide by its rules and have little empathy for those who don't.

The two-part return of the Angels was one of the biggest letdowns I've seen in the show. The Angels were essentially a different creature all together. They could have come up with any other monster to use for these episodes because they changed the rules around for Angels so much that they essentially had nothing to do with the original Angels.  In my opinion, they were brought broke in a rushed way to gain hype for the season and tease fans with their return.

The actual use of them fell completely short. In 'Blink' we have a unique plot with clever story telling. The Angels provided a very interesting way to tell a story. When Sally first gets the letter Kathy sent from the past, it is a shock! You know you are in for a ride with a weaving plot. Add to that the clever way the Doctor and Sally communicate by video, and it's no surprise why this episode won the hearts of lots of fans. It was very clever and unique and tense.

The Angels ability to send people back in time lends the writer *extreme* creativity to tell the story, but in Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone none of that is used. Not a single person is sent back in time by the Angels. Instead, we have Angels snapping the necks of the soldiers, then using their voices to lure more soldiers to come over and then snapping their necks.  We end up with ""Angel Bob"" as the voice of the Angels which just doesn't fit at all.  The actor had an extremely goofy voice, so any fear or drama I was supposed to feel of the Angels communicating was lost on how ridiculous it sounded.

To put a voice to the Angels ruined the effect for me. What was so creepy about them was that there was NO communication.  You couldn't reason with them, or even understand WHY they were doing it. There was nothing, just statues that moved whenever you looked away from them and the terrifying realization that if you even blink your eyes, you could be sent back in time forever. But instead, we get what was pretty much a slasher movie.

The final straw for me was when we actually got to see the Angels move.  We were lead to believe the Angels were insanely fast creatures, yet we see them moving so slowly when they move. This clearly was done as a scene to ""look cool"" but completely fell short for me. The Angels were scary because you never saw them move. You couldn't! They were too fast to detect and were biologically forced to become stone when viewed by someone else.

I understand that the Angels we saw in Blink and the Angels in the cave could perhaps be two different types of Angels, or that the Angels in the cave were low on energy and could only kill, not send people back in time... but then why bother using the Angels? Why bother using the monsters from one of the greatest Doctor Who episodes if they aren't going to be the same at all? Looking at this from a fan perspective, I don't see how anyone can be satisfied with the episode. To me, it feels like the Angels were used. And that disappoints me.  They had so much potential to do some amazing things with an army of Angels in a cave, but instead it was your run-of-the-mill monster episode.

And this doesn't even take into account the ridiculous story of Amy and her scene where she has to keep her eyes closed now. I understand how they were trying to turn things around and make it different (keep your eyes shut instead of open), but it was weakly explained and felt very forced to me.

Also, the rule of ""that which holds the image of an angel becomes itself an angel"" is a very dangerous implication. It was the driving force for Amy's sub-plot of the story, but I don't think it was thought out very well for the long term. Under that logic, everyone should be an Angel, because they all looked at the Angels and had reflections in their eyes. Any photos of Angels would become Angels, so anyone who has taken photos of statues which were actually Angels would produce more Angels, and in turn anyone who looked at those photos could become Angels (maybe that will help stop all of the r/doctorwho posts of statues). Basically, it could be never ending and everything and everyone in the universe should technically be an Angel eventually.

Add to all this the extremely disappointing return of River Song as an over-acting, flat character, and the Doctor deciding to use a gun (when really they could have come up with any other device to active the gravity), and it comes off as a poorly written action movie instead of the highly anticipated return of (arguably) the most creative/unique monsters in the whole New series.",0,1336575045,null,0,false,0,c4lz560,t3_te6t8,t1_c4lz560,t1_c4lv7tw,null,1428889258,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

First I'll say we've already heard this time and time and time again. It's been through here and has become the subject of ridicule. If the show were to actually implement such a completely far-fetched and idiotic idea, it would have jumped the shark.

This makes absolutely no sense, would thematically cause major issues and derail an otherwise well-written character with *another* overcomplicated and contrived ""reveal"" that would just be pulling something out of their ass as a ""surprise.

There are so many, many reasons as to why this is not just improbable, but flat-out impossible:

He's not become irrational *or* violent. He's actually been the most empathetic of the entire cast, caring about ordinary people and their ""small victories"" in The God Complex or sympathizing with the Gangers in The Almost People. Rory's gotten more assertive, more skilled, but not more angry and *certainly* not like the Master.

Regenerative energy has nothing to do with ""time energy"" or the time vortex. His exposure to it would do nothing to his mental state other than give him a headache from the sheer reeling revelation that River is somehow both their baby daughter *and* their childhood best friend.

The faith in the God Complex is meant to be a religious faith. Frankly he loves Amy devoutly but not irrationally. He doesn't rely on her like the others did with their idols so much as feel the need to protect and care for her.

And the bit about the noise? God, how inaccurate.

That noise is the Cloister Bell. It rings *whenever* there's an emergency in the TARDIS that would cause it to die or be in agonizing pain. It has gone off *many* other times that just in ""The Sound of Drums"", not just in Classic Who but New Who as well. It goes off at the end of Turn Left *and* in Waters of Mars *and* in Time Crash.

No, the Master was okay with regenerating because of the ring he was wearing and his plan to rebirth himself after the fact.

And *bullshit* Rory was the only human who hasn't freaked out at the TARDIS. A *shitload* of others have stepped into the TARDIS without so much as a ""bigger than you'd think"". Rory wasn't freaked out because he had ""studied up on all the latest scientific theories"" and was playing it cool.

Overall none of this makes any sense at all. 

Seriously, we have heard this ""theory"" enough already. Let's all just give it a rest.

Which would mean:

* trying a new way to achieving one's goals in life.
* trying a new way of struggle to achieve a noble cause.

true,Xaethon,cnty-uk,Manchester &amp; Salop,"I don't propose any reform, but to keep it the way it is. Well, at least keep it unelected.

1. Being unelected means it doesn't threaten the democratic supremecy of the House of Commons. The House of Commons can bypass the House of Lords after they've vetoed three times, going straight to royal assent and being signed by the monarch. (If the House of Lords were elected, it doesn't seem sense that the House of Commons should retain this right as they (HoL) would've been democratically elected by the people, also that could therefore make legislation bound between the two chambers).

1. The House of Lords as it stands contains people from broad range of backgrounds (Earl of Selborne, Lord Attenborough). Those in the House of Commons are normally only career politicians who say they represent the public yet even they are public school educated and have a wealth larger than the average person...so how do they represent us? [Edit: revised it]

1. Back to the point about them becoming elected, people would be unlikely to vote for someone who has a wealth of expertise compared to someone who does well on telling the public what they want to hear. People look at the persons character rather than what they intend to do. At the 2010 general election, people would've been unlikely to vote for a Labour MP from what the government as a whole brought the country into, even if their local MP was labour at the time and did his job well. 

1. Look at the benefits cap earlier this year, the government wanted to include child benefit in the limit, yet the [House of Lords said that it should be excluded](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-16675314). I don't know how it's gone down recently, whether the House of Commons bypassed the House of Lords and disregarded their decision, as it says could be done in the article.
&gt;He said child benefit was ""a universal benefit"" and it was ""wrong to see it as being a welfare benefit"".
&gt;
""It's a benefit which is there for all children, for the bringing up of all children and to say that the only people who cannot have child benefit are those whose welfare benefits have been capped seems to me to be a quite extraordinary argument.""
1.  Another example would be the previous government in the House of Lords tried to limit the right to a trial by a jury, which the House of Lords defended for us.

If any reform is going to be done, at least make it so that previous prime ministers/members of parliament cannot sit in it.

Sadly this is all I can think of and I need to go now.

Seeing as Arsenal haven't really been successful at the top level for quite some time, you know in terms of actually winning trophies, it makes sense that they don't fit my argument, and I probably shouldn't have included them in that shortlist of rich AND successful clubs. Thanks for pointing that out.

As far as those other clubs at the very top of the Forbes Rich List; (Man Utd, Real Madrid, and Barcelona; which rank 1, 2, and 3 on the list respectively), they have all spent loads on gigantic transfer fees in the past 5 years, and all also happen to be some of the most successful clubs (winning trophies) in that same time period.

just in case you can't remember, a few that come to mind are:

Berbatov for 30 million pounds
Phil Jones &amp; Ashley Young for around 30-35 million pounds combined

Sanchez for around 20 million pounds
Fabregas for 29 million pounds (i'm sure you remember this one)

Ronaldo for 80 million pounds
Kaka for 55 million pounds

I'm not in denial about the fact that Abromavich's transfer spending=trophies in the cabinet.  

Far from it, that's actually what I'm arguing: that in order to be successful, i.e. win trophies, investment of this kind is needed. 

I'm only trying to point out that Barcelona, Man Utd and Real Madrid's recent additions to the trophy cabinet were acquired through much the same types of transfer spending, and so it is hypocritical for fans of those clubs (well utd and barca anyway; no madrid fan would be delusional enough i don't think) to slag chelsea off for 'buying titles'. 

My point is simply that there is no other way to get them, and Arsenal's lack of transfer investment coupled with its lack of titles in recent years clearly illustrates that point.

They have come a long way and a lot of what they have said, especially Nigel Farage has come true. 
I don’t see what’s wrong with Britain keeping strong relations in the Commonwealth, considering that seems to be the only place with any growth left in the world. The world is a big place and getting imprisoned in the EU, where the percentage of world GDP is decreasing year by year, we need to continue trade with the wider world, especially the English speaking countries of the world that all run on similar government, business practices  accountant and taxation systems as ourselves. 
There’s nothing racist or middle Englander about that at all.

If you are willing to pay a bit more for something with a bit of quality, it can be great.  If you really like the traditional CAMRA type ales, maybe less so.

Sometimes I'm in the mood for the traditional pub and pint of Deuchars, sometimes I want to go to Brewdog.  There is no doubt it attracts a younger crowd and even in my tender early thirties I can safely say on a Friday or Saturday after 8, I'm feeling like the old fart in the corner.  It's not a hipster crowd, just the youth of the day with their pastel jeans and thick-rimmed glasses.  However, I've had more amazing new beers at the Brewdog bar than anywhere else in the past year and for that I'll happily put up with the posers.

Exactly.  One of people's biggest flaws (and a pastor told me this) is their love of religion.  In any big organisation you see the same ethos, the same list of issues:  Bystander effect, group think, gossip, social alienation and bullying, tribalism, pecking orders...

I have to be honest, the rest of your comment I am split on!  I agree wholeheartedly that putting on a grown ups sports day when we can't afford to keep schools and hospitals open is a shitty use of funds.

But then I also feel the problems with Rochdale, and other Shitholes is the people, and that no amount of money can or will solve that.  To me this, and other notable incidents don't scream of a lack of funding.  They scream of the need for cultural and institutional change.

I doubt that 20% more bobbies on the beat would have caught these guys or the 20% more funding to CPS would have meant earlier prosecution.  20% more police officers just seems to mean 20% more people to prevaricate and add to the bystander effect (which I am blaming for police inaction without any real evidence...).

The question I find myself asking is where were the parents/guardians, where were the neighbors?  I work with kids, some from good homes, some not.  I know when they suddenly have a new mobile or cash or they are not around because someone else is coming and picking them up and taking their places.  Some of them have spoken to my co-workers about sexual abuse.  That is how you both catch and prevent this type of crime: openness, honesty, shared life.

But none of us are paid for this, it just sort of happens when you know each other and each others parents and things.  For some reason, that was not happening for these girls in Rochdale.  And that makes me think the people of Rochdale need to look long and hard at themselves and ask ""where was I when the little girl next door was being picked up and dropped off crying at midnight?"".  A month ago I saw a black man, clearly quite drunk carrying a Chinese toddler.  It was 1130pm, the kids was crying he was shouting and swearing at it.  So I turned around and followed him.  He wandered about a bit, stumbling and not getting any happier and I was getting ready to call the police and report just that I thought the child might be in danger.  Then he reached the local chinese takeaway and (I assume) the kids mum came out, took him, thanked the man and seemed to know him.  I felt much better seeing that and getting home cold and wet than getting home dry and wondering.  Maybe my actions were to little really or maybe I was a little racist or maybe I should mind my own business.  Or maybe if someone had done the same in Rochdale we would have read about this 2 years ago with only half the number of victims.

So I don't oppose more funding, and I agree if this happened in Chelsae or Harrow it would be taken differently.  But I don't think the lack of that funding absolved the local people of responsibility for each other, especially for each others' children.",0,1336582574,null,0,false,0,c4m0rh4,t3_ted4s,t1_c4m0rh4,t1_c4m0b2h,null,1428890087,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The most important part for us is wage savings from offloading all of these players. Even if we only offload 50% of Acquilani's and Cole's wages again we are still looking at least 20M in savings.

If Cole and Alberto decide they want to play football next year and we hold out for transfers then they should each be worth 5-6M euro. Kuyt is already being linked at the 8-10 range since his wages are more reasonable. Wilson, Maxi and Pacheco from 1-3 each.

The best outcome is we clear all of them for ~25M and save another 25M in salaries. Worst cast is we save ~15M in salaries and clear 10M in transfer revenue. The most important part is the wage structure, since transfer fees are fudged around anyway. At the worse case 15M gives us the ability to sign 4-5 players on decent wages.

Is it *really* important that they're called Pakistani Mulsims rather than Indian Hindus? That depends on who you ask, I suppose. But it's still wrong and the Telegraph would be wrong for using those labels. The fact that you say ""Well the majority of the population don't know the difference"" is entirely the point. If we had different terms for murder and mass murder (I don't think we do?) and the wrong one was being used all the time, then similarly CH could make such a comment.

Yes, it's bordering on pedantic and may be semantics, [but as was pointed out elsewhere the difference between raping a 5 year old and a 15 year old is huge.](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ted4s/police_accused_of_failing_to_investigate/c4lwxa1) That's even without considering the differing ages of consent in various countries.

You're taking issue with the fact that people are discussing aspects of the case or how it's presented without being constantly distracted or outraged that young girls were raped. Well, that's your lookout I suppose, but it's possible to be more objective and not assume that any criticism is somehow in favour of the rapists. But are you similarly outrage that a Labour (ex) MP who could be using this case to score political points against the GMP?

edit - You edited your comment as I was writing mine and added a bit so I'll respond:

&gt; CannibalHolocaust's comments are to seemingly legitimise their actions by claiming the rape of five 13 to 15 year olds is not quite so bad because they aren't pedophiles. It's disgusting.

No. He's not doing that at all. That's entirely your perception. That you recognise paedophila as being worse the hebephilia, even though you're using the former to describe the latter, is a mistake on your part. If I said ""baby raper"" and you said ""Do you mean paedophilia?"" I could accuse you of the exact same thing as you're accusing CH: ""You're putting a different label on it and justifying their actions! Disgusting.""

&gt; they're doing is making light of a very serious situation

What, hebephilia is legal all of a sudden? People are using the wrong word to describe the situation - it's still the same situation. Do you think that if the court said ""hebephile"" instead of ""paedophile"" the judge/jury would say ""Oh whoops, we thought this was about paedos. It's not, so throw it out of court!""? Of course not.

&gt; But, it's not that bad huh? 

Please stop reading into what people are saying and implying/stating they mean something else. It's not very honest or fair.

By the by, I'm curious: Do you think there's any real difference between someone having sex with a 15 year 364 day old and someone having sex with a 16 year 1 day old person, ignoring the legal aspect? Before you decide I'm trying to excuse paedophilia, hebephilia etc: I'm not. I'm just interested because you brought up the legal age in Spain etc. Do you think that anyone who has sex with someone under the age of 16 is a paedo/hebephile, even if they're in a different country with different laws?

The other enabling factor is what happens to the 'successful' kids, they go to find universities and employment elsewhere if not further south, and start a family in a place they have no real connection to. Run the cycle long enough and you create ghettos where no one wants to live and along come the bulldozers (I think they call it 'gentrification').

I do a lot of gardening and I see 'our' approach to society similar (if not identical) to the treatment of soil:

* Schools like to produce yearly monocultures, like the farmer plants one crop annuals.
* We punish the 'weeds' with herbicides, whilst not really putting in effort to understand why we have a weed problem in the first place.
* We extract everything from the soil without leaving enough for future generations, who then are heavily reliant on artificial stimulants (which reminds me of corporate/social welfare and 'quantitive easing').

As to your question that was my first thought: [a failure of the dominant culture and collective parenting](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ted4s/police_accused_of_failing_to_investigate/c4lzbs7). People have disapproved though. 

&gt; So I don't oppose more funding, and I agree if this happened in Chelsae or Harrow it would be taken differently. But I don't think the lack of that funding absolved the local people of responsibility for each other, especially for each others' children.

I had written something that would address this but my internet connection dropped and it was never posted. The question I would ask is why don't the 'local people' have a shared responsibility for each other? Why aren't there closer social ties? I see this simply derived from the financialisation and exploitation of most things. We've largely removed the need for any interaction: our children are orphaned to the state, we drive around in cars not having to talk, and our daily lives are a given over to corporate interests, or wasted on a 24h/week TV addiction which sedates much of the population (it was called ""Friends"" for a reason). There is very little interdependence, little 'shared commons'. I don't want more funding I want the environment made fertile to allow wealth to be generated from with in, or at least let us have the artificial pathologies curtailed.

Norway and Switzerland are often given as examples of countries in europe surviving outside the EU, but this is nonsense.

There are flaws with the system, but if we left there would be even less democracy.

The EU should never be about leaving or joining again, it should be about reform.

I am using the example to describe how mass ignorance on a subject does not mean that it is not reasonable to correct a mistake made by a National newspaper.

Mote was hilariously one of the biggest critics of alleged fraud by members of the European Parliament.

Basically most of Classic Who is designed to be lots of big stories that take up multiple episodes called ""serials"". These don't have a traditional beginning, middle, and end and instead have rising action followed by a cliffhanger.

They were never designed to be watched over and over and weren't made with marathon sessions in mind, so if you are to watch Classic Who, don't hork it all down. Let cliffhangers hang.

He makes some suggestions for starting off:

**Spearhead from Space** - The first Third Doctor story

**Terror of the Autons** - The first Master Story, also introduces Jo Grant who is a companion.

**The Time Warrior** - Introduction of Sarah Jane Smith, the Sontarans, and the name ""Gallifrey"". Beginning of transition to the Fourth Doctor.

**Face of Evil** - Introduction of companion Leela.

**Ribos Operation** - Introduces new companion Romana, ""Keys of Time"" story arch begins.

**Keeper of Traken** - Introduces companion-to-be Nyssa and marks the twilight of the Fourth Doctor's story and the beginnings of the Fifth.

**Dragonfire** - Departure of companion Mel and the introduction of companion Ace.

the depth, character and quality of
this premium craft brewed beer.
You probably don't even care that this
rebellious little beer contains no
preservatives or additives and uses
only the finest fresh natural
ingrediants.
Just go back to drinking your mass
marketed, bland, cheaply made
watered down lager and close the
door behind you.
BrewDog: Beer for Punks
BrewDog is about breaking rules,
taking risks, upsetting trends and
unsettling institutions but first and
foremost, great tasting beer.

Dalek's have been terrible in the new series except for their first re-appearance.  Hopefully there won't be another plot about creating a ""new Dalek"" like with Penisface (Dalek Sec) and then the iPod Daleks. 

I do love Daleks, though, especially old school ones.  I'm looking forward to some throwbacks to early Dalek episodes.  Shame they can't go to Skaro, unless aided by some plot device.  ",0,1336587571,null,0,false,0,c4m1x5q,t3_tem0d,t1_c4m1x5q,t3_tem0d,null,1428890636,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

true,whocarestom,num23-away,,"Our right flank defense is a problem, but I think it's a case where you gain more than you lose.  Sure, VdV will drift inside, but Walker has astonishing pace and can provide us with the necessary width, even if he needs to improve his defensive positioning.  As for VdV, I imagine he would excel in a role comparable to David Silva's (or even Nasri): a natural AMC playing on the right, who, rather than attempt a cross, looks to cut inside when the opportunity arises.  In the absence of a true right winger (Lennon is overrated, in my opinion, and better employed as a substitute), using VdV on the right accomplishes three things: (1) keeping our best technical player off the bench and employing him in way that better utilizes his skills, (2) opening space up for Walker on the right, as VdV will draw his marker towards the centre of the pitch, and, unfortunately, (3) leaving us weak on the right, given Walker's defensive positioning issues.  I think the positives outweigh the negatives, in this case, but I acknowledge the problem.  I like VdV, but I don't like the idea of reworking our entire formation around one player, especially one who isn't getting any younger.",0,1336587594,null,0,false,0,c4m1xd0,t3_tdgpw,t1_c4m1xd0,t1_c4m1dvb,null,1428890638,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

In any case I was using the *nationalities* of India and Pakistan as an example as to how a label might be incorrectly assigned because people don't know (or care) about the difference. Flip this case over to India. If a paper described a group of white men doing such a crime as ""French"" when they're actually ""English"" it'd similarly be wrong.

What would happen if the Telegraph said ""nine men of Indian background"" instead of ""Pakistani background""? I imagine people would have pointed out their mistake, but would it have detracted from their crimes? No. Should they not correct the Telegraph on their mistake or even discuss it, because it clouds the issue? I don't think so. It's an aside, a ""by the by"".

While it is slightly different, pondering the incorrect usage of specific terms to do with underage attraction doesn't detract from the crimes as, in the UK, having sex with underage kids (no matter the age: under 11, 11-14, 14-16) is still illegal.

&gt;I guess what I am trying to say is that RA's money bought us talent that would have inevitably come to Chelsea eventually. It might have taken a few years longer but it would have happened nonetheless.

I think that's quite debateable, although Chelsea did make it to CL qualifications by the time Abramovich took over. I'm guessing he probably waited until Chelsea made top 4 before going all in so that the building process can use CL football to lure top talent. Abramovich's impact is just so sudden, that summer he practically bought a new world class first team for Chelsea. 

&gt;What surprises me is when Bates' acquired Chelsea and pumped about 26 mn quid for Ranieri, no one claimed then that Chelsea was 'buying trophies' although 26 mn at that time was a pretty significant amount. Was it because he was English and not foreign? 

I think you're reaching a little bit, 26m is a fairly big number for back then but nowhere near the scale of investment City and Chelsea have put in. 26m is in the range of what top clubs were spending back then (Arsenal and Utd were spending more than that the summer prior), whereas the injection from Abramovich put Chelsea's spending power far above and beyond what top teams in the league were spending. I think that's a key difference, and what happened @ City pretty much followed suit Chelsea's example.

&gt;Which one would you rather have - a 'foreign' owner who loves the football club and willingly invests his own money into it or a local owner/controlling stakeholder who loves the club but doesn't seem to invest into it?

Ideally neither, but it's never ideal is it? I wasn't really attacking Chelsea's spending habit, I just wanted to say that you can't deny it was Abramovich's money which brought Chelsea trophies in the last 9 years or so. Chelsea *were* on the up and up, so yes you guys would probably have won trophies sooner or later, but it definitely helps bringing in a full team's worth of world class talent right off the bat.",0,1336590259,null,0,false,0,c4m2kov,t3_tdji1,t1_c4m2kov,t1_c4lx7ln,null,1428890942,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

First, the fact that the Pandorica turns out to be a trap really squashes any shred of ""cool-ness"" this speech has. The fact that all of them ""whizzing about"" are just waiting for the moment to strike takes away the impact of his words.

Second... why does he jump out and say ""Guess Who?"" I mean, sure... the enemies were planning on trapping him so they probably knew he regenerated and knew this new form, but from the Doctor's perspective most of those enemies shouldn't know who he is. He didn't encounter most of them in Season 5, so they wouldn't really be aware of who he is.

That being said, I actually found this version of the speech a bit more moving than the version with the score behind it. I absolutely love Murray Gold's themes for the show, but this one in particular felt forced.  I believe it's due to the speech not really being that deep or profound but with an over-the-top dramatic score backing it.  Making it seem a bit ridiculous when paired together.

Well said.

I don't smoke. Because I don't want to. That said, if you want to smoke, it's your own choice. As long as you don't smoke when I'm eating or get smoke in my face I don't really care what you do.

I've watched F1 for 20+ years, maybe close to 25. It never once made me want to start smoking. So for me that sponsorship didn't work.

Yet people kept saying all the F1 and Snooker sponsorship glamourised smoking.

Interestingly, apart from Ferrari, F1 is now pretty much tobacco free when it comes to sponsorship.

The problem was that 'Arry played Parker roughly in the same place as Sandro, behind Modric instead of alongside him, so Parker and Sandro ended up basically combining to form 1 mediocre defensive midfielder, giving Arsenal a man advantage whenever we got forward.  Then again, this is 'Arry's team, so our tactical decisions must always appear as haphazard and shoddily thought through as possible.

true,GappyHilmore,IT,italy,"Fellaini would be a good buy since Lampard is getting older and will need decreased minutes. Lucas Moura is young and extremely gifted and coveted by all of Europe, but we don't need him because Mata and Marin are both CAM. Same goes for Ross Barkely.

As for the rest of the players on the list, they've all been linked with at least 5 or 6 other clubs. Wingers are a necessity, with Malouda likely to leave and KDB and Kakuta most likely going on loan again. Lavezzi is an amazing talent but he could be pricey so I would choose between him and Kagawa. 

As for strikers I think it depends on who is leaving. Drogba's situation is up in the air with his recent scheduled signing session being cancelled. I think Sturridge should be sold, he's a good young player but not for Chelsea or a top 4 team. 
There are rumors of Torres being swapped to Atletico Madrid for Falcao, it's probably a good move for the club but the fans(mostly me) won't be happy especially with Fernando's improved form. I expect him to score at at least 15 league goals next year, if not I can't see him sticking around on such high wages. Lewandowski and Oliveira are promising and young, same with André Schürrle.

Researcher -&gt; Senior Researcher -&gt; New Business Consultant -&gt; (Full) Consultant -&gt; Senior Consultant -&gt; Director

Research consists of doing the 'grunt work' for assignments - finding candidates, desk research etc.

If you are competent in Research, you may be given a chance to to get into New Biz which is essentially telesales.  You find business winning opportunities for Senior Consultants to win and deliver.

As a consultant you win and deliver your own assignments.

Senior Consultants and Directors have teams of Researchers, New Biz Consultants and probably a couple of full Consultants working on their 'desk' (read: area of focus/expertise).

Money varies depending on what level you are at.  As a Senior Consultant, I earn (including base salary) circa 40% of what I bill.  Plus healthcare, car allowance and company performance bonus (usually £15-20k p/a).  This is pretty high level executive search though, there are plenty of people working on lower level executive jobs who may earn the same percentages, but not the same figures.

I've been in the business for 5 years.  You don't really need a degree as the job is all about soft skills, but I have never been in a sales meeting and not had a client ask what my background is.  In that sense it helps!

As for firehosing CV's, I dont know I'm afraid.  I have never done it and never plan to!

EDIT: My fees are 35-40% of the candidates 1st years total earnings, split into three equal stages. i.e. 33% of the fee before we start work, 33% when I have provided you with a shortlist of 4 candidates and 33% when the successful candidate starts.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"Interesting... The last session was with Torres, and predictably a clusterfuck. Basically, you turn up to the Megastore and buy the shirt, then head over to the security with the specified item and they hand you a ticket to the queue. The Torres signing was supposed to start at 3pm (I think), lasting 1 hour. I was around the stadium that day since I was going to a nearby restaurant for lunch, decided to wander in and see how it was going. Noon, and it was full. The line was ridiculous and it was mainly a 16-25 crowd. So 3 hours before the thing is scheduled to start and they've reached max capacity, you pretty much needed to be there 5 hours beforehand

Now, this is totally unrealistic for anybody with a family, young kids cannot stand around for 6 hours. Saw a lot of very sad children around the Bridge, not the best really. Lots of crying, disappointed faces, mirrored by the parents. Even saw 1 young boy take his Torres jersey off on the tube and throw it in a bag

Anyway, this has nothing to do with the Drogba signing, just thought I'd give some background on what goes on. They need a better way to do these as all the people who are free and local turn up first thing in the morning and snag all the tickets. I think a lottery system for Members/ST holders online would be best, linked to ID so you can't sell your winning ticket on. First come, first served for any no-shows

It's not ""fuck the poor"", it's ""why are you ass-raping me on tax when I am *far* from wealthy?""

The UK average salary of 23k for a full-time worker doesn't go very far. With an average salary, you can't afford ""average"" anything else. After tax you have £18k left. Let's assume that you have no debt. No student loans, credit cards or anything else. That's an unrealistic assumption because to get 23k/yr you are very likely to have a degree, which costs money. But anyway, minus average council tax £1440/yr, average utility bills £1300/yr. Down to £15k now. Now you need somewhere to live. Realistically you can buy a one bedroom flat or a terraced house in a cheap area. But even the average price of a cheap place is £190k, and you probably don't have £20k saved up for a deposit. So you rent for years and barely save anything while paying somebody elses mortgage for them. And even if you DO decide to buy, an average mortgage is £1220/month, which you can never afford. So you share with someone, that's £7k/yr and you've got £11k left. Running a car - £3300/yr. Down to £7.7k, or £150 a week now. And you haven't thought about essentials like food or a computer, or luxuries like having hobbies, leisure time, eating out, smoking, drinking etc. And definitely not having children. And god forbid actually saving any money for the future.

The current system with our high tax and rip-off cost of life basically keeps EVERYBODY poor apart from a few. Somebody earning the average of £23k a year is still pretty poor. You live in a small place which you probably rent instead of own. And you barely save anything, even if you live a fairly standard quality of life. Now you REALLY have to worry about the half of the population who earn less than 23k/yr. The average UK household has almost £8000 of debt, not including mortgage.

Don't tell me that that isn't mental. The current tax system of wealth redistribution is hugely unfair to the ""average"" person. There is no way that somebody earning an average salary should be paying 25% effective tax rate.

There are lots of myths about Oxford interviews, propagated by the media. They are painted as ridiculous, pretentious interrogations intended to terrify applicants, while they are really just trying to work out how good you are! I'll give you a quick description of the interview process, as well as I can.

Interviewers take pains to make you feel as comfortable as possible, while challenging you and stretching you as far as they can- nobody gets everything right. Often people are given material to look at immediately before or during the interview, and asked to discuss it and answer questions; there is very little preparation that can be done. Science interviews often involve solving problems in front of the interviewer. I'm doing Psychology, and had to analyse experiments and do a few logic problems. I don't know so much about arts subjects interviews I'm afraid! 

Interviews are surprisingly short, never as scary as expected, and can't really be prepared for. They rarely ask about your results or history, as they have the essentials in your personal statement and UCAS application. 

I suggest you have a look at thestudentroom.co.uk for some more information, I think there's a larger community there. 

Oxford is a wonderful place, and there is a lot of fun to be had. Good luck with everything!

If you do end up applying (which you might as well, it'll be good practice) then I'll give you some advice for preparation! Follow your interests- they are looking for genuine enthusiasm, so read books, get involved in any school societies that would be relevant, all that lot.

Rivalry between colleges is almost non-existent. There are a few traditional 'grudges' but few people pay them any attention whatsoever and they simply serve to add a bit more importance to sports matches (which affect only a small number of people anyway). 

Colleges are large, so there is no sense of isolation within them; it's like being in a mini university. Colleges mix a lot, but that is entirely up to personal choice. Lectures are all done by subject not college, and there is university level sport as well as college sport.

[Here](http://www.ox.ac.uk/about_the_university/facts_and_figures/undergraduate_admissions_statistics/index.html) are the Oxford admission statistics, looking at race, school type, gender, nationality etc. The university is very proud of the fact that it judges purely on merit, and couldn't care less where somebody comes from. They take the schooling opportunities that people have been provided with into account (for instance, someone at a poorly achieving school in North Wales getting AAAA in the A-levels is much more impressive than if they went to a public (paid, independent) school where they were likely to have had much better teachers) They judge potential, not just past achievement. 

The majority of students are Caucasian, which is to be expected, but there are people from all over the world and from all imaginable backgrounds. This 'snobbish' and 'borderline racist' idea is a myth, and is very annoying to have to deal with so often, even from someone who's lived in Oxford and knows some students there. 

'Knowledge possessed beforehand' is mostly irrelevant, and often has to be un-learned. Courses start pretty much from scratch, and things you learned at school are covered in a few weeks.

Oxford can be quite expensive, but it is also easy to get by on very little. College meals and bars are quite cheap (you could get by on about £6 a day for food in my college, but many have kitchens so it would be cheaper).

true,Prairie_Dog,cyberman,Cyberperson,"I definitely wouldn't start at the beginning. The First Doctor was very different than later incarnations. The character of the Doctor also evolved over the years, so later Doctors are more like the current portrayals. Also consider that the special effects improved with time, although they never were particularly great. The only serial that I'd recommend involving the First Doctor would be ""The Aztecs"". 

Many people enjoy the Fourth Doctor portrayed by Tom Baker, he has a lot of the whimsical/serious characteristics we now associate with the character. There are many really good serials involving him.

My second favorite classic Doctor is the Fifth, portrayed by Peter Davidson. Almost all of his serials are quite good, some are excellent. He has very good companions to help him along, and the special effects during this period are some of the best of the classic period.

The Third Doctor portrayed by John Pertwee has quite a few good serials, he often works on Earth with a military organization called UNIT to thwart foes. He's also a bit hands-on, practicing a martial art known as Venusian Aikido.

I'm pretty hit or miss with the rest of the classic series, I really don't like the Second Doctor at all, the Sixth is sometimes OK, and the Seventh really had a sort run before the regular show was cancelled in 1989. The 1996 ""Doctor Who: The Movie"" features Paul McGann as the Eighth Doctor, who has the most excellent TARDIS, but it suffers from a problematic plot, and terrible CGI.  This movie was intended to be a pilot for a rebooted series, but that didn't happen till the modern era in 2005. It's worth a watch though, McGann puts in a good performance as the Doctor.

There are a few ""best of"" lists out there than can help guide you. I've found this one helpful:

this is quite a relaxed comedy starring the delightful Dylan Moran, and also a charming performance by Peter Serafinowicz

Episodes is good it has Joey from friends in and he is funny as himself.

Death in Paradise is much more fun than it sounds

If you prefer your murder mysteries mixed with Gardening try Midsomer Murders, but don't really. I mean you can if you want, but like, they're gardeners. I don't know, depends how peaceful you want it.

Reggie Perrin is ok as is Men Behaving Badly I suppose (both with Martin Clunes)

I'm Alan Partridge is very funny, if occasionally a bit cringy but if you like the office you can handle that

The Trip also stars Steve Coogan so if you like Alan Partridge this is mostly the same kind of humour and was apparently mostly improvised, quite funny considering.

I'm going out on a limb here, but if you want a show that is the epitome of Britishness try http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqvddpX1uYA Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie as Jeeves and Wooster, and if you like P.G. Wodehouse's style you can always try Wodehouse Play house, difficult to find but rewarding.

Someone mentioned Jonathan Creek which I highly recommend, and Alan Davies' other sitcom Whites is funny and by no means as racist as it sounds.

Jam and Jerusalem has your beloved Vicar in it but I have never watched it as it seems to be a retirement home for ageing female comics.

Dawn French also stars in Murder Most Horrid, a fun little mock horror series.

Ideal has, lovely fatty, Johnny Vegas in but is occasionally surreal, but Cartoon head and Psycho Paul are both amazing characters

Last of the Summer wine is great if you love old people and bicycles or whatever old people do.

Again with the old people theme there's one foot in the grave, but the only people I know who like that are Father Ted and Dougal, so hey, watch some father Ted.

Open All Hours has some memorable characters, 

as does Porridge,

Red Dwarf is fun for Sci Fi comedy and a delightful Brummie accent, 

The Royle Family has it's moments, 

The Thin Blue line is awful but it does have Rowan Atkinson in it. 

Tipping the Velvet is good if you like lesbians, it's not really a comedy but it has it's funny moments AND LESBIANS. 

To the Manor Born is a great parody of aristocratic english country life, 

The Good Life is a great parody of middle class suburbia, (I think it was originally an American show, but the British version obviously has better actors)

YES MINISTER (yes it needs caps) is the greatest and most accurate political satire of all time (it will apply to US too probably) and has noted Shakespearean actor Nigel Hawthorne delivering the most amazingly loquacious lines you will ever hear. However I must warn you, do not under any circumstances watch the sketch Magaret Thatcher wrote and forced the actors at gunpoint (probably) to perform after she became a fan of the show.

The Thick of it is a more modern political satire. Can be fast paced, but has some amazingly creative swears in it.

Blackadder seems too obvious as do Fawlty Towers and Only Fools and Horses

Coupling is actually quite funny but I think you get that in America

Still Game is great if you want to see sweet old Scotsmen casually calling each other bastards

Dad's Army is the only good war sitcom (please don't hurt me 'Ello Ello' or 'It Ain't Alf Hot Mum' fans)

As time goes by has Dame Judie Dench in and is ok, I mean she's good, again old people warning

Absolutely Fabulous has it's moments such as Joanna Lumley being a sexy bitch all the time,

Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps is kinda funny if you get into it, up until series 4 (I won't spoil it for you but it suddenly gets shit somehow)

If you have ever watched and enjoyed The Twilight Zone, or love the guy who plays Moss from the IT crowd you will love Garth Marenghi's Darkplace

If you enjoy that you might like Man to Man with Dean Learner, which has Richard Ayoade and some Garth Marenghi characters

The Mighty Boosh is worth a go but might not be what you are looking for, but if you do like it try Snuff Box as well

You must, without a doubt try Green Wing and Black Books, I should have put those first, and if you like them or if you like Simon Pegg/Nick Frost try Spaced

If Spaced goes down well you will maybe like Nathan Barley

Lead Balloon is very slow and subtle but has a few laughs

Mapp and Lucia is funny is you like being a snob, a snob from the 20s that is.

15 storey's high is bleak but Sean Lock makes it funny, you need to interspace each episode with something a bit lighter though.

The Inbetweeners is actually really funny for what is essentially an adolescent comedy, definitely worth a shot.

The Smoking Room is an interesting comedy as it is set in just one room, it's interesting to watch just to see how they manage to keep it dynamic despite this. Unfortunately sometimes they don't manage it but it's still worth a look to see how writers work within what we would see as near impossible constraints.

The TV series of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is awesome, way better than the film, but unfortunately they didn't manage to finish all the books, definitely worth a watch though despite it's age.

Sugar Rush is quite funny, and more lesbians, not that I'm into that or anything. Kinda a coming of age thing set in Brighton, a... colourful town.

My Family is great for the seasons in which Kris Marshall performs, if you like him check out My Life in Film, a short-lived series but I enjoyed it. He's that guy who was in Love Actually or one of those type films.

If you enjoy Indians looking at British stereotypes you'd enjoy the Kumars at no. 42 I have never felt the urge to watch it but I am presenting it here to meet the BBC's diversity policy.

Peep Show you really should have seen by now, watch and then watch it again. 

[The Avengers] linked so you don't mistake it for the cartoon, is a great, very British cold war spy type thingy, with Patrick Macnee an absolute legend and some amazing female counter parts, and some shit ones I guess you will be thrilled captivated and amused but mostly just blown away by Patrick's charming Britishness, and it is very stylised, the director had some interesting ideas and some of them definitely work.
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(TV_series)

Phillip Pullman (the guy who wrote what you call the Golden Compass, but we call Northern Lights) has some good TV adaptions such as I Was A Rat (I found it particularly amusing watching with my siblings but only because we constantly teased one of my sisters about having played a rat in a pantomime, I don't actually remember it) and his Ruby in the Smoke series with Billie Piper (blonde, people went mad for her when she was in doctor who) must be good because the books were amazing. You might even learn true facx about the 'opium wars' while you are enjoying yourself. (They weren't some kind of gang warfare, it was state sponsored drug pushing, yay Engerland!) But this is only a miniscule speck of the wonders that await you in the world of Phillip Pullman.

Young Ones is an 100% accurate representation of student life in the 80s with absolutely no exaggeration and will be very educational for you about British life in those times.

Teachers is gently humorous little doo dah about teachers that managed to go on for 4 series without anyone realising it existed. It's watchable. Not a priority though.

Outnumbered is worth a mention if you like laughing at ""first world problems""

Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere (the closest we get to trailer park boys)

WEIRD STUFF (I mean weirder than before)
League of Gentlemen (awesome)
Nighty Night (weird, sometimes fun)
Psychoville (weird, even Dawn French is in it, and she's at her weirdest, I like it, but you might not)
Jam (search 'Mr Lizard' on youtube for some flavour)

I have tried to avoid sketch shows other than Jam because that is a whole 'nother list and your OP didn't really seem like that was what you wanted so I decided to end on Children's TV that is very entertaining for adults

Sir Gadabout (first series only, the second series they upped the budget and there were no ridiculously crap props to laugh at, and I think some idiot started writing a script)
'Horrible Histories' a funny yet educational program that as well as scooping up bajillions of kids tv awards it also won Best Sketch Show at the British comedy awards, yeaaa a grown up award!

true,rablenkov,uk,Southend-on-Sea,"&gt;How about themselves? With those bloated salaries.

I'm sorry but how in the name of God can someone pay themselves via their own taxes? With respect, you're making no sense.

The idea that the public sector is full of people on ""bloated salaries"" is sheer nonsense. Let me give you a real world example. I work in the public sector performing a skilled job. If I did the same job in the private sector, I would be earning up to double what I am now. That isn't hyperbole, it's fact.

&gt;According to the [1] Office for National Statistics Public Sector Workers earn ~7.8% more per hour than those in the Private Sector.

Sigh. This old chestnut. That particular ONS study does not compare like with like. The public sector contains a higher number of professionally trained staff and a higher number of degree-educated workers.

The private sector includes a larger number of unskilled staff at the bottom end of income distribution. It really is like comparing apples with oranges.

Of additional interest is the fact that, for the 2010 figures, nationalised banks were included in the public sector pay figures. Basically, the figures are not providing an accurate picture.

&gt;I'm currently self employed as a contractor, but my state of employment changes often.

OK, so in theory, when you earn a sum of money, you will apportion it to a number of different outlays; tax, national insurance, mortgage, food, bills, etc. If you have a private pension scheme that you've set up, you would be paying some money in to that too. If I decide that I don't like the idea of paying for your pension, can I give you less money when I avail myself of your services? Is that an option?

As another aside, it should be noted that public sector pensions form part of the remuneration package. When being hired, staff were told that approximately 95% of their remuneration would be via a monthly salary, and 5% of their remuneration would be a pension contribution. Public sector pensions are not a lovely gift being provided by the government because they're awesomely generous, but because it's part of the agreed package of remuneration.",0,1336639664,null,0,false,0,c4mc7gd,t3_tg3t2,t1_c4mc7gd,t1_c4mc47a,null,1428895552,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

I really don't think that's a comparable measure. The difference between the private and public sector in this instance is that you can choose which contractor you want. If Peter-W charges £100, and puts £10 into his pension but Robert-W only charges £90 and doesn't have a pension, you are entirely able to choose to go with the cheaper option. You can value the work based on your principals. 

With the public sector, we don't have a choice in that matter.

&gt;Public sector pensions are not a lovely gift being provided by the government because they're awesomely generous, but because it's part of the agreed package of remuneration.

Right, but the package is overly generous, it is argued.

Not everyone in the country has a private pension scheme. Many have workplace schemes, so what you're saying is incorrect.

In any case, as I've already pointed out, public sector workers have made a career choice based on numerous salient points including pension provision. They already pay into their pension pot via employee contributions and the aforementioned remuneration package.

&gt;what really matter is those on lower incomes.

I couldn't agree more. Which is why many of those people on lower incomes are on strike today to protest against the theft of their pensions.

&gt;And these packages are being renegotiated, people do not need to agree with them, if they(like you) feel that life is so much better in the Private Sector they are free to join it.

I'm sorry, at what point have I said that ""life is *so* much better in the Private Sector""?  There are pros and cons to both sectors.

But this has already been looked at with UK pilots training with the French.

www.defencemanagement.com/news_story.asp?id=16589

But they will be/are flying the Rafale M which is not a STOL aircraft. So have we just wasted money? (again). 

As for flight deck operations, I cannot find a single story to show that we are cross training anyone but pilots (which are learning to fly an aircraft we are not going to buy, in French, which use a launch and capture system we have now decided not to use).  
 
And

“According to Lloyds in London, working on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier is one of the most dangerous jobs in the world.” (http://navysite.de/cvn/catcom.htm) 

This article does give a good overview (www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6f38d5e0-6b12-11e1-9781-00144feab49a.html) but (again) the simple fact is if you are going to have CATOBAR or STOL you decided before you design the carrier and you do not change your mind, indecision has cost millions, delayed the programme and resulted in people gaining unrequired skills. 

As it is both options have cost and training implications. CATOBAR needs a more expensive ship (I know STOL needs a reinforced deck but my limited understanding is that the CATOBAR system is expensive to build and maintain) but the aircraft are cheaper and more capable. The STOL means a cheaper ship that need less maintenance but the aircraft themselves are more expensive and harder to maintain. (a few minutes reading F35.com or google ""CATOBAR cost"" will show this). 

The best and cheapest option then must depend on the use of the carrier, the number of operational aircraft and the management of crew. None of which I know sufficient about to give an informed opinion. 

My uninformed view is that if we want to have a big voice on the world stage through the threat of firepower we need two carriers that should be nuclear powered and be CATOBAR. But are we willing to pay for that?  And why do we allow the political football match cost us millions and (if we do need this) weaken the defence of this country?

Training pilots to land stovl aircraft can be done very quickly and cheaply, so we won't need to go through the expensive and time consuming carrier training and qualifications that cats and traps demand. It also means that RAF pilots can go to sea with a minimum of extra training.

STOVL aircraft also aren't put under the strains that cats and traps put on aircraft, so they might well last longer.

You also don't have to fit the cats and traps, saving money and meaning fewer maintenance and crewing costs.

True, you should be (IMHO) sceptical about everything, including Europe. But ""Euroscepticism"" has come to mean being in line with a certain agenda which leads to an exit from the EU. 

Sadly, we have no *practical* choice in this. We are a tiny country. Without allies we will fail; without economic allies we will be swamped with goods and services from countries that can provide them cheaper than we can. So we need the protection that comes from being a member of the EU (we used to think being pally with the US would protect us, but it doesn't - especially not economically). 

So, once you accept that being a member is a given, you can either go along with stuff or try and run things your way. But since it's a (ha!) democracy, that means having other countries on your side that support your point of view. 

Hence, perversely, a ""Eurosceptic"" agenda means that nobody in the EU will support you, you become marginalised, you never get your way. 

So it can never work, never be a useful strategy - but because it's a ""vote-winner"" parties will always pursue it.

true,Memoriae,eng-Cambridgeshire,Cambridgeshire,"Generally speaking, and this is from just over a year in ""Retail"" banking with RBS, there's no actual mechanism for automatically telling someone that there's an account that costs less.

In fact, the opposite is true. Not only are branches and CAs (Customer Advisors, as opposed to CSO, or Customer Service Officers, the people manning the cashier and info points) targetted for the numbers of ""free"" (In Natwest, these are the Basic and Select accounts) account to premium account upgrades, but they're also targetted for the number of *downgrades* as well. While it's the branch as a whole that is targetted on downgrades, the main reason why the CSOs don't handle them, is that the CAs not only deal with retention, but also are trained to turn the downgrade into a lead.  
Those of you who've tried to downgrade an Advantage Gold/Silver/Blue account with Natwest will probably know about being booked in for a full review. That's not to look at your finances, that's to reinforce what you're getting against what you're spending on the account, and if there's anything else the CA can sell you.

The only time when a CA will recommend downgrading the account is if you mention anything about financial issues. And even then, you might get booked in with a hardass who won't mention about downgrading to save £13 a month on stuff you're probably not even using.  
While not to sound completely shit, a lot of the CAs I've worked with (I was full time in a couple of branches, and had provided cover for about 6 others, comes to about 30 CAs, give or take), actually cared about their customers. One of them, who helped me through all my training, did call her regulars, to keep up with them, and make sure they were genuinely looked after. Even though she works in a branch 40 miles from my house, and there's a branch in the town I live in, I'll make that journey, just to be looked after properly.  
There's been a fair few times when she's nipped an issue in the bud, went through downgrades with her customer, and saved them money as soon as she could.

So anyhoo, on the legal side of things, there's nothing mandating banks to monitor customer's accounts for possible downgrades. The FSA recommends the public to review their accounts at least every 18 months, but there's nothing legally binding for the banks.  
Guideline wise, it's down to the individual.",0,1336644954,null,0,false,0,c4mclnk,t3_tg7tl,t1_c4mclnk,t3_tg7tl,null,1428895732,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Labour, votes 7 042 398. 
Liberal Democrat, 6 076 189. 
Green,	258 954.

With a 65% voter turnout. 

So (as a rough percentage of eligible voters) Conservative 28%, Labour 20%, Liberal Democrat 17%, Green 0.7% (and yes these figures have ignored independents/parties that did not gain seats).

People that did not vote 35% (12 538 459 people)

So we have no majority opinion in fact the largest group is those that did not vote. 

If Conservatives or Liberal Democrats are considered left leaning we have a problem. I do dispute that New Labour is left leaning, even the post the WW2 Labour government was tied to a system that is built on a market structure. As Lenin stated it is more correct to refer to such as a capitalist workers party than a party of the left. 

So if we consider the average as the mode the average person just did not vote. 

Yes, I consider we have a poor system, and I consider that change cannot come from those that benefit from that system.

However, whenever I have a conversation like this I cannot help to think “The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter”.

The issue is the knock on effect on publications that specialise in sort codes. Software that has a sort code lookup. Validation software that the banks use. Validation software that accountants use.

Again, you're not just changing the one system that's completely cut off from the rest of the world.

So a refresher on the sort code for those who want it...

Sort codes determine both the holding bank, AND the holding branch. For reference 535003 is a Natwest branch, located in Gorleston, Norfolk. First 2 digits determine the bank, 50-66 are Natwest codes.  

If you allow for account portability, you also then massively increase the number of possible transactions as well. If someone wants to send money to my account at Natwest, but I've switched it to something else, the transaction goes into Natwest's system for clearing. It returns to a moved account. If the system is in place to redirect that transaction, then it goes to wherever that account says it does. If I've moved from there, then it'll carry on bouncing until it's correct.  
Despite what people may think, electronic transactions aren't processed at one magic location, that knows exactly where everything is at all times.

So yes, changing the banking system to allow for number portability would require a fundamental change in the UK bank account system. It'd also mean a change to the IBAN rules for the UK, which would require more validation when sending money from abroad.

So, I'll reiterate my point.

We could go back to the days where pensions didn't exist and only the rich could live a normal life post retirement. I know so many friends and family who can't viably save for pensions because they don't earn enough (including my self). Now where is the fairness in that? 

But in my mind it is a social right to get pension in any sector of work at the end of your working life. It is a purely capitalist outlook to think people should prepare for the future and if you don't its your own fault. Bullshit! So many people work extremely hard for little money and then they get no compensation for the potential damage they do to them selfs for the benefit of property owners or state. 

&gt; but I do have a problem with the way the unions are spinning this. 

So the Tories are not spinning this at all? why the MP pensions still stay the same and the rich in society are pretty much untouched. The Unions are working for wage-slaved individuals in society, to keep them on a liveable wage and future. Okay there are some exceptions, but generally its to protected the future of these employees. Inflation is much higher then wage increases, so it will only end in more poverty.

The ideas I'm attempting to protect are ideas which evolve in to socialism firstly (then many years in the future Communism may arise), ""evolve"" being the pinnacle word here. I've no respect for Soviet style communism at all (because it was never communism at outlined) and anyone who says ""look at the USSR"" is equivalent to a mindless product of McCarthyism. Capitalism has its place for industrial development which socialism and communism are not highly efficient in, but at the core of capitalism a inhumane system exists and was designed to divides society based on class and inherited capital. Sure there are example of individuals who make it to the higher classes, but thats thru chance and support. Its not based on hard work exclusively, because if that was the case there would be far more upper class individuals. Class is the same as having Wealth and Poverty, one can not exist with out the other.

So my arguments are based on evolving society towards a more humane future, in which life is fairer for everyone no matter where he/she is born or comes from. Capitalism directly opposes these ideals in favour for a select few.

I hope I've highlighted my point, I'm not a great writer.

I just got back from Kolkata in India, where street kids (and adults) are lucky to get 50p a day. Globally speaking, we don't *need* anything, everyone in our country is in the richest 1%. If that is your logic (need over ownership), this is why we can end up in a China style communist poverty state. 

£1m earners don't need that money. But just like my £20k a year is mine, that is theirs. My £20k, I earned it. I worked for it, or I inherited it. It doesn't matter which; it is still *mine*. I'm not saying we shouldn't pay taxes, but there is a principal here that I think is foolish to ignore; what's yours is yours, no matter how much the guy next door claims he needs it more than you do. 

I think the government is a terrible manager of our money. I want the government to generally fuck off out of almost everything. The political class is a waste of national resources. We could all get on fine with a much, much smaller state. And we need to accept that wealth and poverty will always exist; even in communist utopias. People are corrupt, that's all there is to it.

Not at all.

It is not beyond the wit of computer programming to write code with a permanently moved error response to the originating bank that it should update its mapping table to point to a different location.

You seem to be convinced that something which is basically just a mapping table used in a database is somehow exceptionally difficult to put into practice. These sorts of things go on all the time in many many industries without any problem whatsoever.

To extend it to banks needs planning and coordination to develop the necessary procedures and security protections - but the underlying concept is so simple that I genuinely struggle not only to understand why you object to it, but also why you were so rude in one of your replies.

If there is a fundamental reason why bank code portability when deployed as a generic mapping table cannot work - then you have failed to explain what it is.

If a form capitalism exists and the economy has a minimal standard spend to exist in the system, then yes you do. Same with the people in India with the 50p a day, there economy is *just* about survivable, but not liveable. 

&gt; this is why we can end up in a China style communist poverty state.

They are not communists, they are capitalist with a communist party running it, also they have heads of state and fairly barbaric at that, so its not true communism. Its capitalism with a smidgen of suppose socialism, which isn't totally true since they do not have free healthcare, but they do get free education etc. So in some ways, Europe is sometimes more socialist then China.

&gt; Essentially, I don't see how you can gel Libertarianism with Socialism. One is complete freedom, the other is complete management.

Freedom with social responsibility, its not complete freedom like the US style of Libertarianism seems to spout. Look into it, its quite a vast subject and has been around for well over 100 years now. Libertarianism does not mean removal of administration and socialism does not mean removal of a market. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism

Libertarianism actually derived from leftist movements and are very compatible. Libertarianism mixed with capitalism is the oxymoron here, because capitalism outline land ownership and a class divide. I am by no means opposed to people having a house or land to live on, but its not something that exclusively belongs to them, it belongs to the earth and everyone that resides on it. If they die, then it should be returned to the populous as does the body to the ground, not the next of kin outright. But this is quickly getting quite theoretical.

The only detail that is passed between banks is done via your credit file.   
So even if a bank did update their own records, they'd also have to update every domestic bank's records.  
They'd also then have to update banks globally, as the IBAN would be linked to the psuedo account. 

The only way your system would work would be if everyone was assigned a single account number, that stayed with them.

Your problem is that you're applying what you think should work with everything, to something that you have no idea about how it works.

So to break it down for you again.

* Transaction requested for 500000 0000001  
* Bank looks up sort code, sees it as a Natwest one.  
* Natwest take it, and check account 00000001.  
* Marker on the account, redirecting it to 050000 00000002
* Natwest hands transaction off to Clydesdale Bank.
* Clydesdale then look at account 00000002
* Marker on the account, redirecting it to 400000 00000003
* Clydesdale hands transaction off to HSBC
* HSBC look at account 00000003
* Account has a marker redirecting it to 510000 00000004
* HSBC hands it off to Natwest
* Natwest checks account 00000004, valid account.
* Money gets deposited.

That shows that with multiple switching, that a transaction under your model could go in circles.

Now, I know exactly what you're going to say. ""Well it's a Natwest account, they should know it was another account it was going in to!"".  
Hugely false. Once a transaction leaves a bank, the only thing they're looking for is that the recipient bank has received the transaction into their suspense. Nothing more. They don't wait to see if the money has been deposited into the customer account.

To explain; the employee pays in assuming that they will get back out what they have chipped in, and ideally even more should they live a very long time. Meanwhile the employer pays actuaries to keep guessing and playing the averages on when people will die, whilst betting the money on investments. Both sides are gambling that they get the numbers right to make it worth their time to do it.

What the private sector has done in recent years is to opt out of the gamble. They use money purchase schemes so that they have no open ended commitment, but the public sector continues on gambling. In fact it is said that public sector schemes are a ponzi scheme.

In terms of my point about pensions being a legacy. Well, pensions were offered as part of a salary package, they are really just deferred pay. They were a way to bypass the UK government's use of the law to stop pay rises, and a way to get staff during full employment. Employers (private too) could instead offer future salaries (e.g. pensions).",0,1336656650,null,0,false,0,c4mdsvh,t3_tg3t2,t1_c4mdsvh,t3_tg3t2,null,1428896298,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Your questions further down the thread kind of give me the impression that you don't understand that it's a single-subject, entirely-focused course of study in which you take zero classes outside your ""major"" and actually, depending on your degree subject, may have little to no choice at all--this varies immensely across courses. As cynthialf said, if you want an American-style liberal arts education, Oxford is not for you. But if you want to be taught independence of mind and academic and intellectual self-confidence, an American liberal arts BA is not for you. 

Second, you should have a concrete look at the admissions process. The criteria are VERY different than those evaluated by American universities for undergraduate admissions, and the entire process is rather different as well. I know that everyone who meets the required standard is interviewed, and a good friend of mine who is a tutor at The Queen's College was saying that for North American candidates, they give them the choice between coming to England or doing it via Skype. (They used to send Oxford tutors over to New York and Vancouver to do it -- I had mine in New York in 2003 -- but have stopped that practice, apparently.) The info given by the other posters about interviews is great stuff. 

I wouldn't advise you to give any great thought to which college you want to attend. I made an open application and ended up in Pembroke, which was wonderful, but I would have been just as happy at Exeter or Magdalen or LMH, and applicants are pooled, so you won't get all the way through the process just to be rejected because you picked a popular college that year.

Routing a data request would take nanoseconds. I doubt a person could switch accounts often enough in a lifetime for them to build up so many redirects that a transaction takes longer than the regulatory time frame permits.

To be blunt about it - you are coming up with excuses that a junior IT grunt just out of college could dismiss with ease.

Giggs is 38 and Scholes is 37, so I would think that Lampard (33), Drogba (34), and others at Chelsea would be able to play more games in a season than them.

Not to mention that Lampard is in possibly the best shape he's ever been in. I don't think Lamps has slowed down a bit this season. That is certainly not true for Drogba (he has slowed down noticeably since the malaria episode) and Cole (ankles).

But even though these players are slowing down, I think people over-hype the ""our players are geriatric"" line of thought with Chelsea. Just because Drogba isn't the same player as he was 3 years ago does not mean that he can't still be effective while playing a large number of games. He just has to play smarter, and I think he has done a great job adjusting his playing tempo to fit his decreased stamina this season.

true,lol_oopsie,null,null,"&gt;AKA Slave Wage. You're treating people like a commodity, not human beings when you imply replaceable.

Yes, minimum wage is very little. But it's not as simple as just paying everyone more to make the world better. For a start, a lot of businesses couldn't afford that. Secondly, if everybody just suddenly had more money, the price of everything would rise to adjust for it. And frankly, people are a commodity to some extent. If I have a job on offer for someone to mindlessly move boxes from one room to another, it really doesn't matter who does it. There isn't much human element there. If that guy leaves, I'll get another. Some jobs are like this and it's a fact of life.

&gt;I did not say that, I said do not work any harder the manual labourers, which is hugely psychically exerting and generally ends in injuries or conditions toward the end of there working life's.

I agree that physical labour has physical effects, but high-stress jobs exert huge mental pressure. And that often has physical manifestations - stress, anger issues, alcohol/drug abuse, as well as issues about trust, security and constant anxiety. It's all relative. The highest rates of suicide are among professional workers. And weren't hairdressers supposedly the happiest workers in the country, even though they earn very little?

&gt;So he took a risk, but funny part there is he must of had enough money to survive. So he's already in a better position then a large percentage of society.

Sorry, but almost everybody in the UK ""survives"" just fine. Unless you are starving on the streets, you're surviving. The problem is that we've re-written the definition to mean you have a decent size house, a car, a TV and everything else. Even people on minimum wage have a house, regular food, leisure time and probably have TV, a Sky subscription etc. Not to mention the free healthcare and free schooling for their kids. 

&gt;Why does he deserve the stress and pain of this? Surely this should be shared across the organisation of workers, everyone would be better off at the end of the day. Better pay for all and better working conditions. Its not rocket science.

Because he wanted to do it. He wanted to work for himself. He wanted to make a success of himself, and he wanted to reap the rewards in terms of money, lifestyle and everything else. It's an investment and he took the gamble. Therefore he deserves the rewards for that gamble. You know, not everybody is happy with security and mindlessly working away for somebody else. Some people want to take the lead and make things different. And I don't see any reason they should be punished financially for doing that.

true,Tactful,uk,Bristol,"I can tell you why, because I once watched a BBC Four documentary on drinking culture in the UK.

Basically, up until the 80s everyone drank ale. Then in the eighties a new generation started drinking, and they wanted to define themselves as different from their parents, their fathers. So European lager companies who previously had trouble breaking into the UK market jumped on this hype. They started marketing import lager as like a cosmopolitan alternative to the traditional ales which they branded ""old"". It became a case of ""drink something new, don't just drink what your dad and his dad before him drank"". So then you have these groups of young men going down the pub in suits, ordering a round of Bud or Stella. There were massive ""Bring back Real Ale"" marches and stuff, but they could never really bring it back as the beer standard, and so the ale market died down and eventually became the equilibrium we have today.

However, 'real ale' has had a bit of a resurgence lately thanks to some clever marketing, particularly from the Hobgoblin brewers. The ale brewers are basically doing what the lager brewers did 30 years ago; marketing Ale as a sort of cool, new, and different beverage to enjoy on a night out. ""Try tasting your drink,"" state the Hobgoblin adverts.

On a whim I tried one a few months back and loved it. I think we'll start seeing a slight shift back in the direction of these ales. Eventually, all the older ale drinkers will die and the equilibrium will probably shift back to lager, until something happens to markedly change it.

This the point I agree most with. I think these are big players and they show up big time to big games. But what about the rest of time? Drogba has 5 league goals this season. The form of Drogba and Torres throughout this season has been a major factor as to why were finishing 6th (!) this season. 

Lampard too, I just can't agree that Lampard hasn't slowed down. He's put in more anonymous performances this season then I can remember. His assists numbers have been declining to the lowest we've seen in about 10 years. Recently, Lampard has been fantastic, and this was sparked by him moving in a deeper midfield role and out of the box to box role that he dominated. 

Over a couple of games they can still play like world beaters. Over the course of 10 games though they are not the same players they were. Even Giggs and Scholes hit a point in their career where their appearances went from 50 a season to 30 season and this isn't a recent thing. 

It's just my opinion and I'm sure plenty others like you who will disagree but I just think if we wish for Cole, Drogba, Lampard etc... to be most effective, we need to find suitable replacements who will win the fulham, wigan, aston villa, west brom, swansea type games. The end of this season has been amazing thanks to Drogba and Lamps, but we can't let a couple good months stop us from rebuilding the squad. We made that mistake last season.

That should be obvious. Actually, I am a bit surprised I have to explain it.

Then again, I am increasingly viewing your constant arguments against account portability as a collection of straw men put up in increasingly desperate attempts to block something that would be a very good idea.

I also explained higher up that yes, there are security issues to be addressed - and they can be addressed. Do you really think it is beyond the ability of a bank to verify the identity of someone making a request to their systems?

Well that shows your social conscious then doesn't it, fuck everyone else I can hear you saying, fuck the disabled, fuck the injured... literally fuck everyone because you are okay. This is the mentality in the USA even more so and look how hugely fucked up their society is because of inequality, UK unfortunately is not far behind. Governments with socialist policies are succeeding better then center right governments, look at Scandinavia or Germany (Which is a conservative government, but fuck they don't dare touch the social fabric such as unions etc). Any country that is aimed towards US style capitalism is suffering bad right now.

&gt; You can work for whoever you want, for whatever you want. 

&gt; You seem to have some belief that you are entitled to something. But if you have no qualifications, experience, skills or anything else worthwhile to an employer, why do you feel so entitled to having them pay you whatever you want? I think people need to look at themselves before blaming other people.

You're contradicting you self. I don't believe people are entitled without contributions to society or their community, I believe people have the right to work and have a liveable wage which includes dignity and enable freedom of self development. The fact is, people at the bottom of the chain do not have free choice as you point out. Generally they can not improve their education post 19 years old without it costing a shit load of money. So if you are low earner, have disabilities or have existed in social neglect, your life would be pretty damn difficult. Its slave wage, you are forced to grind hard for very minimal reward. It sounds like you've had a fairly privileged life from your opinions. Perhaps you should think about other peoples life's before saying such unthoughtful comments which could potentially affect their life's because of your own privilege.

&gt; Do we want it to break the problem of the elective dictatorship?

I think my response is Yes. But I'm not sure I understand what you mean.

&gt; Do we want it to provide expertise to the legislative process?

Given that the first chamber does not provide this, the answer must be yes.

&gt; Do we want to optimise it's ability to revise and improve legislation?

This is, or should be, it's remit so optimising here is crucial.

&gt; Do we want it to be accountable?

A true Senate of the form that I propose would be required by its constitution to account for each and every decision.

The question is then who, if anyone, would hold it to account? If this true Senate is drawn from people who have demonstrated a lifelong commitment to critical thinking, then they will hold themselves and each other to account: flawed reasoning by one will be torn to shreds by the rest.

Also, if we retain the law-making chamber's primacy, then there is no need for the law-revising chamber to be accountable to the people because, in a stalemate, the elected Commons will assert its power.

&gt; Do we want it to remain weak and cowardly in order to sustain strong government?

Definitely not. Government must be strong *and* good.

&gt; Do we want it to be a microcosm of society in terms of race/sex/age/background?

No. That's what we should aim for in the law-making chamber. In the law-revising chamber, experience and the ability to think logically is far more valuable than demographic mirroring.

* If you want to provide redirection, then you need 2 way communication from a potentially untrusted source. Communication from the recipient would be verified financial information, and in the constraints of Faster Payments, sending back verified financial information offsite to what could potentially be an unverified source is illegal.
* Electronic payment isn't just UK-wide. Legislation would need to cover international transactions, or the establishment of a single entity that ALL international transactions to the UK would be handled by. Both would either add unnecessary delays to an already slow system, or incur extra costs, which would be passed on to the customer.
* There are services provided by all UK banks that switch all outgoing payments and details across, governed by strict timescales that have financial penalties for the bank if they are breached. The same system will redress charges incurred by the customer if it is because of a delay.

If we are going to play with the big boys, we need strikers that either have experience at the top level (Adebayor/Llorente) or have the potential to grow into an elite striker (Damiao/Remy). Jones is neither of these. We should keep a younger (Lancaster/Coulibaly) or free (Saha/Defoe) striker as 3rd option. Jones is not going to be sufficient cover if our main man is injured, gets tired (which will happen) or goes cold. If we buy him with this in mind then I honestly think it would be a backward step.

Your examples are great, firstly you don't differentiate between groups, secondly you don't differentiate between targets, assuming all to be civilian.

Not ""alright"", but also not terrorism and not targeting civilians for indiscriminate murder.

true,lol_oopsie,null,null,"lol, sorry but how is ""survival"" an abstract term? In Malawi, if you don't earn, you will die of starvation or thirst. In the UK, if you don't earn you have a slightly smaller house than average, maybe only one TV, and still have free healthcare to help you live until your 70's, which is time to raise children and grandchildren (for free of course). I'd say that people in the UK are surviving just fine.

You say that ""there is enough resource to go around"", but you're missing the point. It already DOES go around. It goes around a LOT. Someone earning £23k a year immediately loses 25% of their money before they even receive it. Not to mention the 20% on top of everything you buy, and the duty on petrol, tax when you save money, tax when you invest it, tax when you buy a house and even tax when you die.

If you expect to live in some sort of magical society where everybody is equal and money doesn't buy you an advantage in life, who is actually going to have the initiative to DO anything?

My point is this. We already help the poor in the UK a lot. You can literally never lift a finger (for whatever reason - laziness, ill health, whatever) and you can still live to an old age, raise children and have leisure time. And if you DO work, you get a minimum wage which is liveable if you are realistic about what you can afford. You also get holiday pay, working conditions, free healthcare etc etc. And there are middle class people who work just as hard and who don't benefit from that help and who still pay a shitload of tax. And then you have people so are so rich that they don't give a fuck and they abuse the shit out of the system. THEY are the people you should be whining about. We shouldn't punish *normal* people any more than they already are.

You seemed to think that the £23k was a lot of money. It isn't. And you have to realise that someone on 23k is really not that much different to somebody on minimum wage. You worry about all of the same things in life - renting a place, saving for a deposit, hoping to buy somewhere, wondering if you can afford to run a car, buying the bargains in Tesco etc etc etc. You still can't ever afford to send your children to private school, or save up a deposit for a house for your kids. In most ways, anybody earning under about 35k is living roughly the same life, just with slightly different surroundings. The guy earning 35k probably lives in a nicer place, but it's all relatively and he's probably just as stressed and miserable as someone earning 12k.

Instead of complaining that you aren't getting enough share of somebody elses money, think that they they might not want to give it up because their life is really no different to yours.",0,1336679287,null,0,false,0,c4miqnb,t3_tg3t2,t1_c4miqnb,t1_c4mf6i5,null,1428898691,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I think its dangerous for the nation to make decisions on this when so many people are stupid and make terrible decisions every day. its safe to let idiots vote, because then (more) inteligent (but still evil) politicians can make decisions.

Im guessing what you mean is, its dangerous to get gun-ho about something without the proper facts.

I dont think the general concensus was for a war in iraq, but rather the media did a good job bending the stats to make it look like america was screaming its head off for revenge.

He says that Al Qa'eda no longer is a real thing, but something you tell the police if you want to get rid of your neighbour. what he means is they arent plotting anything, they've finished their active part of work. they plan to crush the west through pretending to be bigger than they are, and force armies to fight and for the western world to crumble under the cost of this. They're winning, and they cant lose. we stay they win, we go, they restart bombing shit and force us to go back. we wont leave anyway, because of oil.

Indeed this scenario demonstrates rather well why we have the situation we do - if we had 'at will' employment then sudden strikes without warning would be the only recourse employees would have, and that would be truly paralysing to the economy.

true,LightningGeek,eng-staffordshire,Wolves,"Generally a good article, however there are a few problems. First, the Tornado is a much better ground attack aircraft than the F-18. It is purpose built for the job, and yes it is a little older, but it can carry a wider range of air to ground munitions as well as having the ability to drop them accurately and carry much more at once. The verdict is still out on the Typhoon as a ground attack aircraft though, although as long as the targeting can be done right, it could do the job very well. However, the Typhoon should be the much better aircraft in air-to-air engagements, as long as the pilots are up tot he job.

Also, the link to Fleet Air Arm pilots flying F-18's is rather spurious. It shows a patch with an F-18 on it, but talks of it being a T-45, which is a slightly redesigned Hawk aircraft.

Apart from that, it's a very good point about the F-18. It would make a very good interim carrier fighter (if we install catapults) as well as being able to take on a ground attack role if needed. It may not be the best aircraft for either job, but it is much better than a traditional jack-of-all trades type aircraft.",0,1336685534,null,0,false,0,c4mk6oz,t3_tgw6d,t1_c4mk6oz,t3_tgw6d,null,1428899371,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

One, is that youths hang out till late at night by shops. 

The second is that these shops stay open late, such as hot food establishments.

Chances are these two groups will meet on a regular basis.

In a very small minority the shop owners will do fucked up shit like we've seen.

Now I am in no position to bring much more to this. I have no facts of my own.

The points I've seen being brought up are that the youths out in these places are namely white/english.

We also have the stereotype that many of these shops are owned by asian people.

Mix into this what I've heard on radio talk shows and the like that ""white girls are more loose than asian girls"" and you have this idea that it could be possible that asian guys take up the idea that white girls are ""easy"" and are free. Asian girls are much more tightly held to their family, keeping virginity is immensely important, and honourable and so asian girls are much more hard to get.

I don't really know where I'm going with this.. I have no real idea myself, these are just things I've picked up.

It would be great to have a real discussion on this. It is definitely not a racial issue, that is never a thing. But cultural, yes that may be it.

But with such a sensitive subject, its hard to discuss.

We can however agree that the people who do this fucked up shit are in a small minority.

true,CannibalHolocaust,uk,London,"&gt;One, is that youths hang out till late at night by shops.
The second is that these shops stay open late, such as hot food establishments.
Chances are these two groups will meet on a regular basis.
In a very small minority the shop owners will do fucked up shit like we've seen.

This is a good outline of what's happened. It's clumsy to suggest it's ""white girls"" because most of the girls were from care homes and the rest broken homes and this makes up a tiny percentage of white girls. All were working class. Middle class girls were unaffected and Asian girls were also unaffected with a few exceptions (I read that one Bengali girl was also a victim). 

Now, the situations developed when takeaway/fast food/cab office owners started developing a relationship with the girls who would gather around their shops (on the high street) late at night. They would offer them free food, cab rides and eventually alcohol/drugs and a place to stay. The girls would be under the assumption that this was merely them being friendly. They would in fact be doing this with the expectation of sex and so would rape them when they were drunk and in their premises. 

How to prevent this: better policing of these high streets, posters put up on establishments warning girls not to accept free 'gifts' from people. Police encouraged to talk to local business owners and residents to tell them to report any dodgy behaviour which may exist on the high street especially involving grooming. Since most of the girls were from care homes and almost all would have been in contact with social services it's a failure on the part of social services to protect these girls which should be their primary focus. They should be in regular contact with them, asking them if they've had any contact with groomers and warning them against such people. They should also know in advance where the girls are if they choose to go anywhere late at night as well as have their mobile phone number. I would say tough sentences and deportation for immigrants but it looks like this is already the case, it was enforcement which was lacking. Police should also not discriminate against girls reporting rape/sexual assault because they may have been drunk, out late at night or been 'troublemakers'. They should investigate regardless of the victims' background or what she was doing at the time to prevent future cases occurring. People who knew about this but didn't report it (possibly other business owners) should also be punished by having their licenses revoked and possibly a jail sentence or community service.",0,1336691177,null,0,false,0,c4mldm7,t3_tgxsg,t1_c4mldm7,t1_c4ml15m,null,1428899945,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

One could argue that the charities sector is a dumping ground for costly ventures that really should be supported by public finances, and fills a gap that is caused by a difference between a governments ideals (and therefore committed spends) and expectations of the society propping up the government. Health research, community betterment, outreach and direct avocation for the more maligned in society are an example of areas that fall into this void. This has become especially notable with Dave's 'vision' of a big society. Equally people doing work in these areas should also be reward fairly, and equally with public and private workers of a similar 'level'. 

One could also argue that a hell of al lot of charity work is used as cover for morally abhorrent accounting practises or for simply dubious financial transfers - especially notable where the actual spend by the charity on cause is paled by its internal costs. 

So to put yourself in the generalised private sector is to not do yourself justice. Just because the binary descriptor of public/private is the most common, it does not fit all workers.

This subreddit really annoys me and I constantly upvote people willing to have constructive arguments and prefer to reply instead of downvote as should others. It currently just skews every point into the stupid circle jerk of everyone making crappy gut instinct generalisations and discourages people with opposing opinions from commenting as they just get buried. The amount of times I've seen a ""huurr duuurrr it's the rich people, the Tories and the banks fault and we're all suffering so bad, capitalism is evil"" comment upvoted to the top is ridiculous. 

Back to the argument previously, the slave wage, I'm a victim argument is rubbish, I returned to higher education as a mature student with around 3k debt in credit cards, no previous qualifications whilst working part time for minimum wage in bar. On my access course there was an unemployed divorced mother of three who was still recovering from a brain tumor, single parents working part time, two people who had escaped from Iraq and been on asylum for the last few years, middle aged men who had lost their jobs and people who just wanted it enough to decide to do it. Not one of them was unable to get a higher education due to finance or any other reason and they are all either finishing or have finished their degrees now.

Redistribution is fine in certain areas i.e child services, sick and disabled, but it's just stupid and inefficient to tax someone and then give them the money back in some form of benefit, why not just take less in the first place. Our whole tax and benefit systems is so complicated and absurd that it creates bizarre unintended consequences and actually punishes people that use it through it's complexity by wasting their time and tax payer money for basically nothing but political pandering. 

Everyone should have a personal tax code that takes everything into account, which can turn into positive payments if at some point they are supported by the state. The same code should be used for services so that those need them to be free get them and those that are high earners make a payment based on their income.

true,busstopboxer,null,null,"No, not in the hole, up front as a proper number nine - if VdV were out it'd be Remy/Damaio I'd drop deeper if I were to sub in Jones, although I'd hope to have a couple of good alternatives as well (Moses and Kranjcar/Hoilett). I actually think he'd do just as well as Adebayor has this season if played in the same role. He's not gotten on well at Stoke and that would save us some cash - I expect he'd be available for half the 12m being talked about when we were linked with him last.

Guess it just comes down to me thinking he's a much better player than you do - I think he's been hugely underutilised in recent years and would surprise people by stepping up to our level very quickly he's one of the most underrated players in the league for me. He's certainly a better option than either Saha or Defoe would be, and though I'd like to see them get more experience, the likes of Lancaster and Coulibaly aren't nearly ready enough to be relied upon yet.

When it comes to back-up to for VdV's in-the-hole number ten role, I'd probably stick with Kranjcar, or set him free and go with Hoilett, who I'm not entirely convinced by, but is undeniably a bargain on a free at only 21, and could turn out to be amazing. Dempsey is too much as back-up to VdV to my mind (and would be costing at least 15m after the season he's had, if not more if Fulham try to beat us with the Downing yardstick Liverpool set last summer).

While he seems talented, I think you're right about Falque needing another year on loan - he only made a single appearance at Southampton, and was subbed at half-time (I'd be very happy to be proven wrong there though - he looked excellent at times in the EL for us).

Note that they don't have the new jerseys yet.

Here is information I copied from one of my comments on it earlier.

They may certainly be fakes, however the company is in Taiwan, where most jerseys are made, so they may be factory direct as well or factory rejects. Either way, I've ordered about 3 jerseys from this store (with two more on the way now) and I CANNOT tell the difference between the ones ordered here and official ones ordered from Kitbag. They also offer champions league number printing and badges right now as well so you can turn your jersey into a champions league one. I think my current order was two jerseys, personalized, badges, shipped...under $65. It's hard for me to pass that up, even if they are (really good) fakes.

You could argue that but generally charities are much more efficient than governments, or at least that is the idea (more volunteers, shitter conditions like pensions), which is why they farm contracts out to us. Again, I don't think you can separate a large proportion of charitable activities from the public sector any more than we can for people who now work for Circle health care within the NHS structure. All the things you listed are also done by the public sector. Big society was a substanceless marketing strategy to cover the destruction of public services, nothing more. If you wanted the third sector and others to pick up the slack you would invest in them not cut their funding. 

I suppose you could argue that, but only in the way that you can argue that all governments are slaves to corporations, there are good and bad. I doubt you would agree with me claiming that all public sector workers are lazy so lets not make unsubstantiated generalisations.

&gt; who often had to work long hours in three different jobs and at weekends to support a growing family.

So his dad flip flopped between being unemployed during a period famous for full employment, and having 3 jobs, even having to work weekends like some common shop keeper or tradesmen. Such horror!

Utterly shocking he had to patrol the playground every lunch time *on his own*, no backup, not even a gun or knife to keep order behind the bike shed and footie field. He deserves a bravery medal.

That said, I was a kid in the 80s and I remember those strikes.  I don't recall a single one that happened on a ""moment's notice"", we always got letters sent home informing us in advance of the strikes.  
Like his father, he must be a serious thicky to have not noticed the letters his secretary was sending home to parents giving several week's notice.  I guess the trauma of working the mean streets of the tennis courts every lunch time got to him.

true,yacob_uk,newzealand,Aotearoa (née Norfolk),"&gt;generally charities are much more efficient than governments

That requires some significant citations.... that (and the ensuing argument) is akin to saying that the private sector is more efficient than the public sector, and we know that's not true unless some significant caveats and controls are applied (c.f. power sector and public transport sector over the past 30 years). I would argue that these things are outsourced more because its far easier to drop the activity &amp; massage accounts to show ideologically skewed spends than keeping it in house, but thats just my opinion based on a few years of working in the public sector in IT. 

 &gt;If you wanted the third sector and others to pick up the slack you would invest in them not cut their funding. 

Absolutely, however, there is no spare cash, and all budgets are dropping, so defunding charities is actually politically less of an issue than defunding frontline services. By outsourcing you apply a layer of separation that you can hide behind when the money is short. And I'd argue thats exactly whats going on now.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"I can't take any writing about Liverpool and transfer policy that doesn't mention wages seriously. It shows a complete lack of understanding of player cost structure. 

The largest component of player cost are wages. Transfer fees are amortized over the life of a contract and wages must be added to that figure to give you a total cost. It is absolutely ridiculous and disengenous to compare the £35M paid for Carroll and to add the £18M (16, actually) paid for Henderson and say that four players could have been purchased for that price.

All of the new transfers have been conducted with a new wage structure put in place by Comolli and the new owners. It is a much more cost effective and sustainable structure.

Our problem at the moment is our high wage bill made up of squad players or players out on loan who combined cost us almost £30M per year. We need to clear out Acquilani, Cole, Maxi, Aurelio, Wilson, Pacheco, Kuyt et al. That afford us £180-200M over 5 years. That gives you 5 good first team youth prospects who can be attracted to the club on decent long-term deals.

I would much rather the total fees and wages we pay for the lot we got last year and have a 50% success rate of signings than to add another half-dozen expensive older players who are difficult to offload. The 'failures', such as Downing in this case, still end up having a book value of £10-15M and are easily sold to mid-table teams because their wages are in order. A failure like Downing still only ends up costing £5M, as opposed to the £25-30M that a bad signing like Cole will cost us, even though he was a free transfer (by the reckoning of this article Cole was a 'good' signing because he was free).

I would be happy if we repeat last seasons signings again this year and add 2 or 3 out of 5 or 6 signings as permanent first team members on a lower wage bill. No club has a 100% success rate of signings. It took Spurs 5 years worth of transfer windows to build a first 11 from over 30 different signings, but they did it with a sustainable wage structure. The old Liverpool way of panic buying players on low transfer fees but high wages must come to an end.",0,1336726998,null,0,false,0,c4mr5j7,t3_th418,t1_c4mr5j7,t3_th418,null,1428902736,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Only if you're inferring that not being a victim somehow means the overall damage doesn't matter.

&gt;Their propensity to giving bombing warnings for attacks on public infrastructure.

Yes, all the people killed or injured should have known better.

&gt;Your examples are great, firstly you don't differentiate between groups

That's the problem with doing stuff that other groups continue - you don't get to start something and then pretend it's nothing to do with you when others do the same.

&gt;secondly you don't differentiate between targets, assuming all to be civilian.

The latter means the former is irrelevant.

&gt;Sure, the IRA bombed some pubs, usually to kill specific people within them,

Another case of 'did anyone get hurt nearby? Never mind'

&gt;usually valid targets of war

Don't kid yourself, this wasn't a war.

&gt;that the UK would not hesitate to kill in similar circumstances. 

Which doesn't happen 'by your leave'. Welcome to the difference between armed forces and terrorists.

&gt; but also not terrorism 

Er...yes, it is.

&gt;and not targeting civilians for indiscriminate murder.

Ah, so as long as they're kneecapping, at least they're not planting bombs? Amazing logic.

&gt;You might want to start that yourself,

I won't rush to do this, considering you haven't started yet. As requested before - links, please.

&gt;you've not even bothered checking who's responsible for the things you've cited

Oh dear, you're going to wheel out the 'Real IRA' and so on, yes, so as to avoid responsibility? Even ignoring that removing those doesn't change the majority of examples, we're now into schoolyard excuses instead of any kind of defence or justification.

&gt;nor whether their targets were justified under the rules of war.

Again, this wasn't a war; You don't get to redefine the term because it suits your purposes - after all, the likes of the Real IRA could say the same, at which point you have to then explain how they're not allowed to use the same redefinitions as you.

Completely agree.

It's just we group together to pay for services from the 6 million.  But they do, in turn, spend some of their wage on services from us.

In a part of the world where poor women aren't even considered second class citizens the number of incidents going unreported and especially unpunished is heart breaking.

I think some of us remember this article from last month: http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/04/to-be-a-woman-in-pakistan-six-stories-of-abuse-shame-and-survival/255585/?single_page=true

Pakistan, India and Bangladesh have all had female leaders in the past so it can't be said that women are totally hated but among the poor and uneducated women have nearly no status and those of lower castes have none.

This isn't a Muslim thing, during Partition no religious or ethnic group was free from crimes against women and for millions of poor women and girls things haven't improved in over 50 years.

I don't believe the men who committed these abuses would care if their victims were white or not. I believe they just wanted victims who would not be able to speak out against the abuse. Maybe they do believe that 'white sluts deserved it' but they're monsters and this **isn't** a common viewpoint in any sensible Asian household.

In Pakistan, their victims would typically be girls and women of lower castes and even if they did speak out very little would be done. It takes massive public outrage to get any sort of justice and even that takes years.

I do think that Pakistani communities need to do more to acknowledge and prevent this abuse. 

I recall there were communities where men from the mosques would go out in to the areas where prostitution took place after evening prayers and 'ask' the prostitutes to leave. It's a start but really they should be targeting groups of men out at night looking for vulnerable girls and women.

If they acknowledge this issue they might prevent further abuse, it's a start. I don't see attitudes towards women changing for the better even within the next generation. These men lived in the UK for decades and still think nothing of their victims.",0,1336730541,null,0,false,0,c4mrekg,t3_tgxsg,t1_c4mrekg,t3_tgxsg,null,1428902855,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

In fact, it could be argued that playing shell games, where money is shifted around internationally and then loaned back to the parent to avoid tax, is financially irresponsible, tax havens are not always in politically stable countries.

true,frankster,null,null,"well its a price / demand tradeoff. if corp tax is too low you get more companies but make too little money off them. just as if tax is too high you get a lot of money of a small number of companies. there is a sweetspot.

If corporation tax becomes too low then it means a greater tax burden falls onto individuals. This reduces the ability of individuals to save, deal with unexpected eventualities like recessions etc, or marshall capital to start a new business.

I actually think we shouldn't be concentrating on attracting large business, instead we should be reducing barriers to entry to encourage thousands of small businesses to spring up. Some of these small businesses will grow into medium or large businesses.

I think for example legislation that guarantees flexible working hours or times to employees, such as mandating that employers offer reduced working hours if employees request it (for proportionally less pay of course) could allow people much more opportunity to start up their own business.

For example my sister's employment ends in October and she wants to become a fulltime freelance makeup artist. So she has a limited time of about 2 months after she leaves her current job to have enough weekly clients coming in to sustain her business.

Most employees are tied down to inflexible 37.5 hour contracts with not much scope for negotiation on hours.

Were it possible that she could demand that her current employer reduced her hours to e.g. 3 days a week, she could have a much smoother transition over several months (or longer) that would allow a much greater chance of her getting a business off the ground without risking everything.

At the moment there can be some very high barriers to starting a business - the internet has drastically changed this for some but I believe that there is much more the government could and should be doing to improve the standard employment structure.

There is definitely a sweet spot for all tax. Personally, I think it's too high at the moment. People who earn more can also dodge it more easily because they have much more complicated affairs and the ability/understanding of how to avoid tax. 

I would say however that we need to reduce government spending as a whole. Otherwise, as you said, tax burden falls onto individuals. But if we can cut spending, then the tax burden doesn't fall on anyone as much and we all have some more money in our pockets.

Starting a small business here is awful. And many of the employment laws make hiring people a total pain in the arse, and very expensive too. But I do agree with you about working hours and flexibility. The 9-5 system is so stupid, and it collides with everything else. What sense it is being in work while all the shops are open and once you leave work, they're closed. Why do our parcels get delivered during the day when everyone is out? Why do schools finish annoyingly a couple of hours before a regular job does?

I think we should try to chase the large, tax dodging companies. You'll never legislate them because they will find loopholes.

Unsurprisingly, teaching at the better school is much better. The kids are well-behaved and you actually get to TEACH, rather than spend 80% of the lesson disciplining. And of course the teachers are better, more intelligent, more motivated and more friendly. So I think your experience can vary wildly depending on where you teach.

You're right that the syllabus changes, but during 2 months off in the summer, it doesn't take you that long to adapt. She says that you spend a lot more time when you start teaching, but once you have built up your materials and lesson plans, you can more or less keep them the same for following years. For instance, GCSE and A-level content hasn't changed much for most subjects in almost 10 years.

Bearing in mind that most people get about 4 weeks off in a year, teachers get about 2-3x that, with a 6 week break in the summer alone. If you teach at private school, it's even better. My school used to have 9 week summer holidays.

I'm not saying it's super easy, but it's really not that hard. Once you've done it for a few years, you will need to spend a lot less time in preparation.

It's just that if you cut corporation tax and increase income tax you disproportionally move the tax burden to employees, which tends to be the middle and lower earners in the country.

This is because most company owners will receive dividends from the company and take little or no ""income"".  So an income tax increase wouldn't really affect them whilst affecting everyone else.  They *do* currently contribute to the country by ensuring their company is successful and thereby paying corporation tax.  (And profits have to be realised to pay out a dividend, so this is a kind of taxed income).  It's treated differently because there's substantially more risk in running a business than being a paid employee.

So remove corporation tax and increase dividend tax then?  Well, could work except you're putting company owners and retired people who live off investment dividends in the same bag.

true,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"&gt;It's like the 50% tax bracket that labour brought in. Trying to screw people too much just made them dodge tax, and in the end the 50% rate brought in less than 1/2 of what it should have. Everybody just lied.

Why is 50% screwing people? The top rate of tax was 60% or above before 1988. People dodged it because the could, the answer would be to close the tax loopholes rather than removing the tax. Besides we don't actually know how much it brought in yet we only have estimates rather than actual figures. And the tax was only in place for one year before it was announced it would be cut, having a tax in place for such a short amount of time is going to make it easy to avoid by people simply bringing forward or deferring their income for a year.

&gt;We are lowering corporation tax every year, and that's a good thing. Eventually we will have the lowest in Europe, and some companies might actually move here and PAY, rather than do all of this overseas bullshit to dodge it.

That's fine until another country tries the same thing. Then the race to the bottom is on.

In yours and my pensions we contribute each month and the contribution is invested.  At retirement age the value of your pot is assessed based on the investments you've made and a value of your pension per month is calculated.  In teachers contributions the money they contribute goes straight into the Government's coffers and is spent on bailing out banks (yes, yes, plus the other things they spend £600bn a year on).  The Government then agrees to pay them back in the future.

So in essence it is a double edged sword for the Government.  They could pay their employee into a private fund, but they don't want to because they will get a big loss in revenue now.  So for those half way through their careers they are being screwed because they don't want to start again paying into a private fund, those at the beginning will go straight into a private fund if they're given enough information about it (which you never are at the beginning of your career).",0,1336741042,null,0,false,0,c4mscf8,t3_thrps,t1_c4mscf8,t1_c4ms9ns,null,1428903296,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"&gt;Personally I disagree about whether or not companies raise or lower prices based on tax changes. You can bet your life that if we charge Coca Cola 10p extra per can of coke that the price will pretty soon rise by exactly 10p. If you think they'll just eat the loss you're crazy. Sure if you charge Coke 10p and Pepsi 5p you'll see something different happen but that is not what we're talking about here.

Well I was talking about corporation tax more than a tax per unit like VAT. Even so there are other factors involved in pricing, if they raised their prices by 10p people might just buy less coke and they would lose out overall.

&gt;Also corporate profit is nothing like normal person income. A company will reinvest 100% of the profit back into their product or they'll pass it on to their employees as salary. Even if they keep it as cash for a while they're still only going to use that cash later for some reason or as hedging some sort of risk. I think this is the key thing people aren't grasping when they rail against obscene corporate profits. It's not like the corporation is just endlessly accumulating cash and doing nothing with it.

They could just pay it out in dividends to shareholders. Or decide to invest it outside the UK (which is good for wherever gets the investment but not good that the UK got less tax and the profit was spent elsewhere). Or they could just hoarde it, apparently companies are sitting on a huge hoarde of cash at the moment because they are afraid of investing in this economy. If it was collected as tax instead the government could have used the cash to stimulate the economy.

And FWIW I think that private pensions should be much more heavily regulated.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"This was rubbished from what i have seen.  I don't see us taking 32M for Bale when last year we turned down 40M for Modders.  On the other hand if Barca was offering 32M plus a combination any 2 of Alcantara, Bartra, Tello, Fontas or Cuentca (will NEVER happen) we would certainly listen. 

I have no doubt that we would consider selling Bale but below 45M it seems unlikely that we would be in legitimate conversations, and even if he wants to go to Barca i don't see him taking a pay cut to do so, not when City is out there offering 250K/week wages to anyone they are interested in.

I think i saw yesterday that Barca was in for Jorid Alba for a left back because Bale was too high a price.

[Take a look at Directive 2004/38](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:158:0077:0123:en:PDF), particularly Articles 6 and 7. For the first three months, EU citizens are allowed to stay freely in Member States, provided that they have ID. Once you cross the three-month threshold as an EU citizen, certain additional requirements (regarding being self-supportive, a student, working/looking for work etc) must be met to continue residence.

Unsurprisingly, there is a swathe of case law that accompanies statute, so you can't take it solely on face value (for example, proportionality is key when Member States are looking to deport someone for not meeting the requirements under Article 7 of Directive 2004/38). Additionally, much depends upon whether OP has been working/looking for work during that period etc etc. Of course, if they have been working during that period, and not paying tax, that's a separate issue entirely...

I would imagine, although I don't know for sure, that the best first step is to [contact the UK Embassy](http://ukinnl.fco.gov.uk/en/) and see what they say.
