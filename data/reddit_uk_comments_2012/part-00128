true,CDK2012,null,null,"- **Pending Electricity Crisis.**

Fuel prices are already painfully high but it's generation capacity is set to be eclipsed by demand and facilities coming to the end of their lifespans.

Simple solution is simple; the UK is in the running to be the world leading researcher in new nuclear technology.  Japan is out of the race, as is Germany.   The US is having some sort of energy-dissonance, schizophrenic-climate-change denying breakdown episode type thing.  There are currently, realistically, three countries in the running; France, UK and India.  It's the UK's for the taking.  The UK has already identified several prospective sites for new nuclear facilities.  Start building them now and then throw the nation's shoulder behind nuclear R&amp;D.  Renewables are not going to be able bridge the energy gap at predicted levels of consumption.  We've not got 20 years.  Wave power shouldn't be abandoned but it can't be the solution yet either.

Build.  Build.  Build.  Become self sufficient.  Generate surplus electricity.  Sell to Europe.

- **Pending Pension Crisis.**

Speaks for itself really.  Retirement age can't stay relatively static whilst life expectancy goes up, and when pension funds are exposed to market pressures.  It will take a cultural change, one which even questions the future of retirement altogether.  Regulated private pension funds geared towards local, micro finance and co-operatives are the way forward.  Your local community and highstreet becomes the pension.

- **Civil &amp; Human Rights**

Technology and cheap travel has revolutionised the world in the last 2 decades.  There's a constant battle about what level of monitoring, what information can be kept and shared, simply because we now have the ability to store, share and apply vast amounts of data.  We need an informed public debate, with nationally appointed  progressive philosophers respected in their fields guiding it, to establish and write up a 21st century constitution.

- **Housing**

Everybody knows the Conservatives sold off the nations council homes with a distinct lack of foresight.  There is an argument to be made that ultimately this housing would become a millstone to keep renovated.  They didn't build these houses like the Victorians did.  That doesn't address the problem though.   Personally I'd like to see local authorities go into business with potential homeowners and roll out shared property equity v2.0.  Make it in their interest to constantly renovate run down areas and to not leave any properties empty with a constant turn around of council majority owned buildings.  If local authorities could develop a revenue stream from buying and selling property portfolios they might be a little more in touch when it comes to handing out building permission.

- **European Referendum.**

You can't have the Conservatives winning first place and UKIP taking the same number of seats as Labour in the European elections and not be trampled over by the elephant in the room.  Whether you're pro-anti-or shades of sceptical it's silly to be even in this position.  Let's try for a mature debate, make ourselves sick on a rich diet of EU news, study, analysis and debate for 3 months straight until we can't escape from it and then have a referendum once and for all.  

If we decide we only ever wanted the single market and for business to be opened up then let's begin negotiating a UK version agreement into EFTA and leave the EU.  If we decide we're better going down the Swiss model, fine.  If we decide surprisingly that once we've all discussed it we're all happy little Europeans and we can discuss in which direction we want to shape it.  As it is the current state of affairs is a clusterfuck.  Come what may a referendum and national debate has to happen, and happen soon.  If it doesn't happen this masturbatory talk of uber federalism coming from some quarters is going to gain momentum and realistically that means one thing for the UK (whether one is pro-EU or not), a disorderly exit because as it stands it quite simply is an election deal breaker for too many.  If the future of Trident could divide the country imagine think what a proposal of a single EU army and foreign policy will do.  The UK simply isn't ready for it.


- **Higher Education**

I find it utterly strange that we charge people to receive information that they intend to use so they can either better themselves or help better society/community all the way up to national even world level.  I find it equally strange that humans have settled on a status quo where people stop studying exactly when their drink tolerance starts to wane.  Education should be something that is free and always ongoing.  Learning university modules should be like asking somebody what was the last book they read.  Everybody should be slowly working throught their own little modules in their own time, if they want, and constantly building and developing themselves.  I refuse to believe it would even be that expensive an endeavour.

- **Health**

Like it or not no country can go on, year on year, spending more and more on healthcare above inflation and not lose other services at the same time.  If the pragmatic result is that we are in some part going to have to open up the NHS to new revenue streams constitutional guarantees have to be put in place that the size of the private sector will never come close to being more than a small fraction of the public service, and that no NHS reception desk, no doctor's surgery, no hospital ward, will ever have a payment till or a credit card machine in it.  Stop with this building hospitals on easy credit and then paying for them several times in their lifetime too.  The guy that came up with that idea should be run out of town.

- **Banking.**

Set up a national bank, possibly from some of the dead bank wood we already own.  Everybody gets an account.  No overdrafts, no interest, no fees.  No credit cards - debit only.  Free transfers.  If anybody is worried about there being a run on the banks they'll have somewhere safe to put their money.  If banks know that people have a real choice they'll even advocate separating the highstreet banking operations from corporate themselves.  No more bailouts however the cards may fall.  It'll cost to maintain but it'd also help cut down on benefit fraud and help the homeless and/or those declared bankrupt.  I'd go as far that in this modern age having a bank account and a debit card should be a right.

Don't allow their competitive edge to be blunted by inane regulations though.  Beyond the bank levy London needs to remain #1.

- **Prisons**

We'd be able to place a lot more emphasis on rehabilitation if we legalised drugs, yo.  Prisoners in this technological age should all be working on full wages if not in full time education anyway.  Arrest some of it for their upkeep, insist that a significant part goes into savings so they have something to support them when they finally get their freedom, and ration the rest as a form of pocket money.  If prisoners can't get jobs because of their records at least have them with enough money to set themselves up in work or a line of business.  It should be part of their parole requirement.

I think it goes back to 9.  He was also *extremely* dark, or at least had moments of it.  The ones that come to mind are those when he declares ""you don't have the right"" (I can hear it in my head) or when he comes across the first Last Dalek (I like to think that Dalek and the Season 2 ending were the only Dalek episodes, though Asylum was quite good.  It's just the constant attempts to exterminate the exterminators for the last time has gotten boring; Victory at least gets rid of that issue, and Asylum puts it in a new direction).  That latter one was especially interesting, given how much joy he seems to derive from his attempt at roasting the Last Dalek, and how much anguish he had from realizing that his final ""victory,"" a genocide that wiped out their race and his own, increasingly looks like it was for nothing.

It's worth noting, though, how scarred 9 was by that whole ordeal, especially when he realizes what he had become by the end of Dalek.  After that, he gets a similar chance to wipe out the Daleks in the Season 1 finale.  He has the chance to wipe them out Once and For All for the third time now, and decides to be a coward.  He knows who he is now, and wants to avoid becoming that again.

That's why the other doctor's speech about how similar he was terrified him, and led to him doing that.  He likes to think he's a man of justice now- look at what happened to Solomon after all.  He's similar to the other because he is also repenting in a way.

Amy: ""Like, when I first met you, I didn't have parents. I never had parents. And then you did whatever it was you did, rebooted the universe, and then suddenly I had parents and I've always had parents. And I remember both lives in my head, both of them in my head at the same time.""

Amy: ""He says he hardly remembers it."" 

The Doctor: ""Ah, but sometimes you catch him just staring. There are things, Amy. Everyone's memory is a mess. Life is a mess. Everyone's got memories of a holiday they couldn't have been on, or a party they never went to, or met someone for the first time and felt like they've known them all their lives. Time is being rewritten all around us, every day. People think their memories are bad, but their memories are fine. The past is really like that.""

true,[deleted],null,null,"We took trips to my dad's parents' house every other Sunday. We were supposed to bring fish over, and were on a fishing trip on the way to their house. 

If you [go northwest of the part of this lake covered by its name](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=stony+creek%20lake,+washington+mi&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en) you'd hit one road as it narrow, then a second, 28 Mile Road. There's a bridge right in the center that connects the two much larger sections.

We were told that day that it was about 5 ft deep, and while he had a smoking habit, my father was fiendishly strong and used to be a lifeguard. My sister tried fishing for bass in the shade under the bridge, accidentally slung line around herself, lost footing, and fell in. My dad wasn't thinking anything but ""Oh shit, daughter falling, must save"" and dove in after her -- now 230lbs (a hint: it wasn't all muscle and he was a hair under 5'10"") and wish sweatshirt, sweatpants, and big chunky Nike shoes.

In *reality* it was *sixteen feet deep* and partly because of the two massive lake portions bottlenecking into what you can tell in Street View is basically the length of a living room across, had a spiral undercurrent.

My mother came up from the other side where she and I were fishing, also wasn't thinking of anything too MacGyvery at the time and dove into help. She doesn't swim, though, more of a doggie paddler like my sister.

I had just turned 11 and weighed as much as a box of cereal, and couldn't even doggie paddle, so I knew I was no physical match to help anyone, so I took advantage of my freedom and speed (I have cystic fibrosis but back then it hadn't taken its toll yet so I was like a human Sonic the Hedgehog) and took off to a bike path to look for help.

As it happens (Thank goodness!) two people were coming from off the bike path and down the road. I explained the situation in half a sentence and they worked with my dad down on the embankment to hand over first my sister, and then my mother.

We're pretty sure the shove he gave to my mom was the last thing he did, because after some really grunty screaming about asking for help himself, the water was muddy and murky and glass smooth. No sign of anything.

It was like that for a proper minute and a half, I'm guessing, with us urging those two biker people to go in and basically getting a ""Why? So all three of us can die?"" answer (she said it much more nicely but that was the meaning and nobody could really disagree).

For longer than I care to remember we tried getting other people to help. Cars wouldn't stop, or would drive off after we explained the situation, if not for help than for using their cells to call emergency lines (""We don't want to risk being sued if something goes wrong,"" they'd say).

Finally a man came by and asked my mom what was going on. She explained. He asked where we'd last seen him. Then this total stranger dove right into the water. Eerily, he was gone and the water was motionless for a good 20 seconds. He had the presence of mind to swim laterally into the next portion of the lake and dragged my dad onshore -- or (I apologize for this) what was left of him. No color, and probably 50% larger from being waterlogged.

Eventually the ambulance came and, more for show than anything, attempted to revive him. They lifted him up into the back of their vehicle and my mother drove behind his ambulance in a second unit.

We were left there, my sister and I, with some family until other family could arrive and travel with. When we got to the hospital, my grandmother led the way to the room my mom was in. As she turned the corner she said ""How is he? Is he OK?""

My mom didn't know we were following behind.

Still, I would notice after the fact weird behaviors on my end. He worked *a lot* to try to help support us. One of those lots...showed love by busting his arse to make sure we didn't want for anything. Being gone that much meant when we saw him things were all the more magnified, so we got really attached and then he disappeared. After that it made it harder to get attached to people for YEARS because subconsciously I assumed the same thing would happen to them.

She eventually remarried, my sister is the most emotionally resilient person I know (more horrible things would happen to her and she doesn't just get up every day but damn near bounces back higher than she fell) and I'm doing better than ever each day I'm around (a bit sad considering my body falls apart in synch with that, but whaddyagonna do? =)

The Doctor raised her up from that, and in doing so, also raised those around her. Her mother re-united with the one person she truly loved, and Micky stopped pining after Rose and lived his own life.  
  
Donne by all accounts was wasting her potential as well. We saw in Turn Left that without the Doctor, she would have risen a little higher than she was, but no where near the what the Doctor did to her. The heartbreak is that she goes back to her usual self, thogh I think with just enough residual to find a good husband, and grow up a little. She was abrasive, and obnoxious to start with. She's not my cup of tea looks wise...but that's not important really.  
  
Then you have Martha. She's training to be a Doctor, and by the looks of it, not a bad one. She's not reliant on her family, and functions quite well without them. Her first encounter with the Doctor has her save an entire hospital full of people, and get a kiss to boot. This is why she had such a short run. The Doctor made her worse. He made her into a pining, lovelorn woman, who realised that she could never compete with a memory.

The only problem is that woman (or men) who are in this line of work aren't very well protected thanks to the current laws.

Prostitution needs to be legalised.

Any sex worker deserves the same safety and protection as other workers have in other industries.  Sex for money is as old as money, it's going nowhere.  Let's work on making them safe, making sure the companies are legitimate and there's no other criminal side to their operations (people trafficking etc).

We don't need to give criminal records to prostitutes, or their clients. It's not fair or right. 

Just like drugs laws, it creates a whole shady underworld.  With little protection for people if things go wrong.  There are nasty people in this country that take full advantage of these things being illegal, be they pimps, street dealers, people who rush other dealers houses or those rich blokes in suits that have their fingers in the import of cocaine and other hard drugs and the paid off customs / police officers that help.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;Fair enough but you still need some kind of financial support to do that with the price of housing

Not in my experience, anecdotal as it is; I never claimed any benefits - I did go and sign on once, and they said 'you need to come back in six weeks' - so I went back in six weeks, and they said 'no no no, you have to sign on every *week*' - so ended my one attempt at benefits :-)

I also lived in a shitty bedsit and had to travel to London from Orpington every day, not cheap itself; hence it was all jacket potatoes and so on, while working at a London hospital (again, not what you'd call astounding money).

&gt;A well-paid role (or inheritance) will just land in your lap if you belong to the right social class.

No, you can't reduce this to a class thing - that's akin to using an example of an immigrant family living in a £1 million house as representative of all immigrants being scroungers a la Daily Mail. The 'who you know' adage is indeed true, hence the value of networking and so on, but it isn't restricted to public school leavers and isn't the sole reason you can find a job straight away. When we were interviewing people for the first-line-support IT jobs, we were looking for people who's outlook was 'I freely admit I know nothing, that's why I'm here', and at that level, we certainly didn't get anyone shoved onto us because they were X's son - this has happened elsewhere, but it's not as if there's ever been a situation where there are no jobs because they were all given to Tarquins and Jeremy's (at least, nowhere I've worked in the past twenty years).

&gt;Fancy an MP not having a clue what catch-22 is. 

See, this is where this attitude becomes daft. It's not as if the 'can't get a job without experience, need a job to get experience in the first place' problem is new in any way at all, suggesting that you're overlaying what you want to be the case over what this guy actually said, which exactly what the tabloids have done.

&gt;Or perhaps he simply doesn't care.

Sure, he's giving all that advice about taking the initiative yourself for exactly that reason. Overlaying again.

&gt;Just try getting a job with no experience in that sector, let alone none at all.

You're suggesting that *all* the first-line IT bods come from somewhere else? If you leave school with your qualifications, then up to a point you're no different from the next interviewee. If, however, you then do one of the MS courses in, say, Windows 7 (and do the exam for £120) - you've then demonstrated that not only do you have an aptitude for it, but also that you've taken the initiative and trained yourself. *That's* what would get you the post, not bitching about how the government hasn't got a CEO role lined up for when you leave school.

&gt;can be no denying it's an employer's market at the moment and it logically follows that employers wish to drive down wages, conditions and choose to hire those with years of experience.

It's *always* been an employer's market, again this is nothing new. And they're actually *not* going to automatically hire someone with more experience - just one example is that taking on someone with more experience at a low wage means they're more likely to leave for a better offer, whereas a school-leaver will generally still want to build on their skills for a few years before considering jumping ship.

&gt;Our government is needed more than ever to maintain pay and conditions are not eroded and people are not taken advantage of by unscrupulous employers. 

The Gov. can't dictate wages to private companies outside of things like the minimum wage. As there are more people than can do a job, the value of that job goes down; I've seen this happen in IT as more and more people go into it, but I'm not sure how this can be arrested. Part of what this MP was saying was, in short, don't rely of the government to wipe your ass, you need to take the initiative yourself. And he's right, because this has *always been the case*. Not enough jobs? Keep applying. Don't just send the same CV to everyone, tailor it to each job. This was the case *last time* we had high unemployment, and that was when unemployment was higher than it is now (eve higher when you consider UK had ten million-ish less people living here back then).

&gt;Alas they are failing and age discrimination is rife but acceptable because it's only young people who are basically feral if you real certain media outlets.

This is in direct contradiction to your earlier statement - you can't have it both ways. Either they're refusing to hire oldies, or they're refusing to hire younglings - neither of these things is true across the board; if you suddenly decide to change career at 50, then yes you're going to have a problem, but if you don't you'll still have experience to draw on.

&gt;Not insignificantly for most firms each person you have working below minimum wage means you need not hire someone at minimum wage increasing unemployment.

But 'most firms' *don't* have people working below minimum wage - sure, you're going to get contracting cleaning firms and the like that pay very badly, but it isn't as if the majority of workers in London are under that umberella - but this brings us back to the original point; the government is *not* going to just pull new jobs out of its' rear end, which means if you want one of the jobs that *are* going, you have to go that extra mile in order to get it, not sit on your hands and complain about how the government is out of touch simply because they're not doing it for you; because while you're doing that, someone else is going to get the job instead.

You're taking the firm stance that the people arguing against this are ""middle aged white men"" who want to oppress women and moan about minorities, which I don't think is the point at all.

To expand on the point I raised in my other reply - my mate's brother the copper has said that if they want to arrest someone (who's being a nuisance but hasn't broken a law yet) they'll pull the van up right in front of him and say ""get out of the way of the van"", and when they inevitably reply ""I'm not in the way of the fucking van"" they'll nick him. It's an excuse to arrest someone and most people won't challenge the fixed penalty notice and risk going to the mags.

Tbh the ""abusive"" clause covers almost everything you'd want to cover anyway. ""Insulting"" is far too broad.

Probably you can find a similar thing in army surplus shops. I'd start there.

I get that they don't like the system, but voting obstructively all the time doesn't help them, anyone else in the parliament nor does it help their cause.

Try suggesting any thing more than 'Bale Bale Super Bale' on a spurs forum you'll be ignored.

My favorite non-Spurs chants were these two:

From Man Utd fans for Roy Keane:

*Keano is magic*

*He wears a magic hat*

*When asked to play for City he said fuck no, fuck you, fuck that*

*He wouldn't sign for Liverpool because they fucking shite*

*But he plays for Utd 'cause they're fucking dynamite!*

-----

From Arsenal fans for Emanuel Petit:

*He's fast*

*He's slick*

*His names a porno flick*

*Emanuel*

*Emanuel*

We could've easily leveraged the Keano one when Robbie was playing for us but it was too much effort for Spurs fans.

ok, your point is you can only be bigoted against those who are a certain way by no choice of their own. Quite why you think this matters; for example why you think it is perfectly reasonable for people to express hate towards conservatives but not towards a race is a bit baffling to me; if your problem is with 'bigotism' and 'oppressive atmospheres' then I don't see why it matters if the individual has chosen to be that way or not. 

For example you would say people can't be bigoted against Muslims? apparently because Muslims chose to be that way. Do you really think most muslims have much of a say in being Muslim?

Also if you're 1-0 up away at a top club, a player who can't retain the ball is big liability. Tevez and Aguero are quick and tricky, Balotelli wins a lot of fouls, rather as I see Dzeko either miss-control or run down a lot of blind allies.

Well, first of all. The Time Lords at the end of the Time War sent a (temporary) signal into the Time Vortex to make him a phyco to begin with.

The Doctor looked into it for like, 5 seconds maybe and ran away. The Master stayed and became insane looking inside it.

The Doctor is a Time Lord, meaning you don't have to look into it for as long as The Master did to become one.

But exactly as you said, ""...it's the way Time Lord children are raised"".
They are Time Lords to begin with, looking into the Vortex is just a ritual they do. It doesn't make them into Time Lords.

And how about the fact that we don't know if she looked into it? She probably ran away from it *just* as The Doctor did.

That being said, it may take a dozen or so games for Sahin to really start flourishing and showing his ability to dominate and control games as he did at Dortmund.  His style requires a mastery of the system and full understanding of the shape of the team (how teammates tend to make runs/position themselves, ect) in order to help mold the attack like a piece of clay.

There are tons of highlight videos from his Dortmund days, but if you get a chance to watch one of his full games at Dortmund you'll be able to truly respect the impact he had while he was there.

[From wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nationality_law#British_Citizenship_by_descent):

&gt;As a general rule, an unmarried father cannot pass on British citizenship automatically in the case of children born before 1 July 2006. However, if the parents marry subsequent to the birth, the child normally becomes a British citizen at that point if legitimated by the marriage and the father was eligible to pass on British citizenship. Further, if the unmarried British father was domiciled in a country that treated (at the date of birth of the child born before 1 July 2006) a child born to unmarried parents in the same way as a child born to married parents, then the father passed on British citizenship automatically to his child, even though the child was born before 1 July 2006 to unmarried parents. Such countries are listed in UK Immigration and Passport Services publication ""Legitimation and Domicile"". Failing that, the child can be registered as British if it would have been British if parents were married and application is made before the child is 18.

* [What do you do with all the sterling people pay to get their Bristol Pounds? Will it be safe?](http://bristolpound.org/faqs)

&gt; All the sterling which we receive in exchange for Bristol Pounds will be held by Bristol Credit Union as backing for the currency and to provide certainty of value to Bristol Pounds. It will not be used to fund the activities of Bristol Pound CIC. Credit Unions are authorised and regulated at a national level by the Financial Services Authority (The responsibility for this is expected to move to the Bank of England).

&gt; This arrangement will strengthen Bristol Credit Union which has a clear social purpose to be a community anchor for the city, providing fair financial services for all the people of Bristol, and offering competitive, viable alternative financial provision for member benefit and not for private profit.

That's how reliant on sterling the system is. I view it as a caged British Pound rather than a currency in it's own right. The British Credit Union gets ""free"" money, and what do credit unions do? That means the health of the Bristol Pound is reliant on sterling being strong and the British Credit Union not making any malinvestments. It's all very much like localist marketing over the cancerous national currency.

Here's the diary if you want to read it.

* The ring isn't translatable.

* The crack was one that acted as a space-time shortcut, leading to the Atraxi prison.

* Not necessarily. Atraxi were members of the Alliance and so it may have been aware of some of the details. The Teselecta was also aware, so it may have also been a matter of public record.

* This has not yet been explained. What evidence has there been of Silents entering the TARDIS?

* Six months had passed, so maybe she'd been travelling in the mean time, either on her own or with Kovarian and the Silents. She regenerated into Mels, but not black necessarily because she saw the homeless man. This may indeed be explained in Episode 5; I think so too.

* Unknown if he'll revisit the Library, considering that it's now swarming with Vashta Nerada. A future version of the Doctor has already seen River at Darillium and given her the sonic (see: *Last Night*); whether we'll see that again is unknown.

**Liz Shaw**: Actually I'm not sure on this one. Because of the way WTTW Channel 11 in Chicago used to play these early ones she just kinda appeared and disappeared.

**Jo Grant**: Gets married to a young scientist hippie type guy (it was the 70s).

**Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, Sergeant Benton, Mike Yates** (a.k.a. U.N.I.T.): 4th Doctor just leaves Earth because he's no longer trapped there and U.N.I.T. was the only thing really keeping him around. He skipped away with Harry Sullivan and Sarah Jane Smith after his first episode which was on Earth with a giant robot.

**Harry Sullivan**: After a few trips out has another adventure on Earth and then pretty much just says ""meh I'll take the subway"" when the Doctor offers him another ride.

**Sarah Jane Smith**: Kinda the worst one. Doctor drops her off in the wrong town (and who knows, probably at the wrong time too) and gives her some weird line about being called back by the timelords. He then has an adventure alone on Gallifrey and quickly picks up Leela afterwards.

**Leela**: Gets married to a guard on Gallifrey on another Gallifrey adventure (after he told Sarah Jane Smith that Earth people weren't allowed on Gallifrey).

**Romana and K9**: Stay together in another ""pocket"" universe that has negative space-time coordinates. Which is weird but ok we'll go with that. Trapped in another universe. Main reason she didn't want to come back to this universe was she didn't want to go back to Gallifrey (the Timelords were calling her home) after traveling with the Doctor for so long.

**Adric**: Dies trying to defend the Earth from Cybermen. Actually crashes into Earth on a spaceship which is travelling backwards in time, explained as the ""meteor"" that made the dinosaurs extinct.

**Nyssa**: Leaves to help lepers.

**Tegan**: ""It stopped being fun, Doctor"" after a lot of people died.

**Turlough**: Welcomed back to his home planet after his status as a political prisoner is pardoned. He goes home.

**Kamelion**: The Master takes back his puppet robot creation (and it gets killed? I forget).

**Peri Brown**: Gets married to King Yakarnos (sp?) played by actor Brian Blessed, one of the best parts in Doctor Who, ever.

**Melanie Bush**: Just leaves says ""I guess it's time for me to go"" and wanders off with a shady space trader guy.

**Ace**: The original series ended with her. I kinda forget, maybe she ends up at home?

**Grace Holloway**: Never really travelled with the doctor to begin with, just ran around San Francisco with him, one episode. Declined to go with because there's too many people to help here on Earth (she's a doctor).

**Adam Mitchell**: A.K.A. ""The Idiot"" steals information from future tries to record it on his answering machine. Doctor catches him and bye bye loser.

**Rose**: Stuck in alternate universe with family.

**Jack Harkness**: Doctor runs from him after he becomes immortal, though at the time it looked like he had died and the Doctor left because he thought Jack was dead.

**Mickey Smith**: Same alternate universe as Rose but left in a different episode and fights Cybermen there.

**Donna Noble**: Forced to forget or her head asplode.

**Martha Jones**: In love with Doctor who won't reciprocate.

**Wilfred Mott**: Not really a companion, just a relation of Donna who goes along for the ride for a minute (Similar to Rory's dad recently).

**River Song**: Never leaves, just goes backwards in time. So you have to watch all the episodes in reverse now.

**Amy Pond, Rory Williams**: Still here (for now!).

Brad is playing well and I have full confidence in him.  You can't drop someone of his experience and quality unless he gives you reason to. 

Lloris has never played in England and is young for a GK, so I hope AVB sticks to his guns and keeps him as backup for this season.  If both continue to play well, it's likely Lloris will take the #1 spot next season with Friedel either moving on or retiring.  Personally, I'd keep him as GK coach since the guy has sage-like experience in England as well as being very strong mentally.

You had to set up a joint bank account with your Jobcentre business adviser ( who was more than useless and pretty clueless about business to be honest  ) and every time you needed cash ( in my example for printing T=shirts to sell at a market ) you had to make an appointment, go and see them and they had to sign off on it and get the money for you. Then your profits had to go straight back into this one sided ""joint"" account and you were left without a float. 

It basically left you with no room to maneuver and if something came up quickly e.g. you sold a batch of T-shirts and needed to quickly turn around another one.  This - having to ask for everything and it being signed off crap - just made you look pathetic with anyone you tried to do business with. 

It's like, OK they've given you some money and you've bought stock, sold it and made a profit, but now they're going to treat you like a five year old in handling it. This, in turn, leaves zero room for self expansion, especially when your adviser is constantly telling you to ""take everything slowly"" 

Trying to even contemplate setting up a web site and selling this way was impossible.

true,lol_oopsie,null,null,"I'm not agreeing with him, but the riots which spread across the country outside of London were just a case of scum being scum. They weren't to do with race, and most of them didn't even know who Mark Duggan was. They just saw opportunity and weakened police. 

However, in the district where it all started, race *was* undoubtedly a factor, and it's fair for that to be discussed and debated so that we can learn and try to avoid future occurrences. These stats (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18681866) show that the majority of rioters in London were black, but were white in the rest of the UK. The stats as of Feb 2012 say that in total, the rioters were 41% white and 39%, which *is* disproportionately black considering the black population of the UK is only around 2%. There certainly was a race component to the riots, and to crime in general, and we don't do anybody any favours by refusing to talk about it.

The cases of school teachers and businessmen joining the rioters were freakishly uncommon, but they do make better news stories. The majority of rioter were simply scumbags, well-known to police in their local areas already. It's why there wasn't that much difficulty tracking most of them down. Almost 75% of rioters had a previous criminal conviction (http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/sep/15/three-quarters-rioters-criminal-convictions). Furthermore, most of them were young (27% 10-17yrs old, 26% between 18 and 20) - not exactly teacher or professional material. (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17141883)

Rioters were also statistically far poorer, more likely to be on benefits, and less educated than average too. And to be honest.. isn't that what we all expected?
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15426720

Again, we don't do any favours by refusing to talk about these things for fear of being labelled racist or classist.

It has the densest concentrations of pubs per sq mile in the whole of England as well as it is the place where the oldest pub in Britain is(Ye Olde Jerusalem Inn - it is 700 years old!).

There are also 3 girls for every guy on nights out as the universities there have big biotech, medical and similar departments that have very high female to male ratio :-)

If you want to live in a slightly bigger city I recommend Leeds. It is much bigger than Nottingham, but is still quite affordable. You can rent a nice flat in the centre for £1100 or same a bit further out (30min bus ride from the centre) for £600. Or a room in a house/flat share in the centre for £200-£300 per month. It has a great night life, a good university and quite compact city centre so it is very walkable. 

London is not really affordable, but I don't know what your budget or housing expectations are. If you're willing to share a house or a flat with other people you can get an en suite room in a really good area for the same cost as a flat in Leeds centre(sometimes slightly less).

After the season, Harry started making noise about not wanting to go into the final year of his contract because ""the players don't like it when the manager's position isn't solidified.""

Levy, at this point upset because a) Harry is now entirely reversing his position from the England saga and b) Harry reciprocated none of the loyalty Levy showed him during the tax evasion trial.

I should mention that during this whole period, with Harry's typical raving to the media, that Levy's mother fell ill, and passed away. Harry not only never mentioned this, but continued to yap about Daniel not giving him a new contract.

Eventually Levy offers him a rolling 12 month contract; in effect, it's a one year contract, repeated in perpetuity, until one side or the other decides it's not worth renewing.

All knowledge of him would be purged from the universe, thus the question *""Doctor Who?""*.  A universe in which the Doctor never existed might be so bad that the motivation of the Silence would be to actually *save* the Doctor's history by killing him before he had a chance to have his entire history erased.

true,WhoMouse,tardis,TARDIS,"I'll be honest: I think I understand what you're saying.  

It took me three watches of Series 5 to really accept Smith's Doctor.  The transition between 9 and 10 was much smoother to me, and I accepted Tennant's Doctor in his first episode.

I think part of the issue was the massive change in Doctor along with massive change in show feel.  If Tennant had held on for another 1/2 a season or so (or Smith coming in earlier, or some kind of overlap), I think the change wouldn't have been so...jarring.  

But with those two massive changes happening at the same time, it sure felt like a different show for a while.  With the repeated re-watches, I was able to both get myself used to the new styles and pick up on all the tiny things that are the same or at least reminded me of the other style.  I had to find the transition myself though.

Now, from old -&gt; new, there were *years* to get used to not having it around at all.  There pretty much had to be a huge, jarring change just because of how television itself has changed.  But, it wasn't the same just because of all the years in-between, and even that was helped by leaving out the Time War and whatever else happened in the gap.  And there's still people who are reluctant to embrace the new Who because of the changes.  My husband was reluctant for a long time, just for one example.  He really didn't embrace new Who until Ten's specials, and then he ran into the problem with transition to Eleven the same as I did.  

So, as I see it, at some level you really have to *want* to embrace Eleven to really be able to.

* Luiz has been our best central defender of late so he's a lock, but I could see benching Terry in favour of Cahill based on performance, but that's unlikely to happen.
* No change to Mikel/Lampard in the double pivot, but if Ramires starts from the bench as I predict, I'd like to see Mikel/Ramires get a chance.
* I want to see Moses start as he's our biggest winger and size is needed against Stoke. Hazard is a given, and I chose to rest Oscar as he's somewhat hurting and Stoke are a tough team to play against, especially for a small and possibly somewhat unfit player.

And maybe not necessarily younger, but with better suspension of disbelief?  I don't know exactly what the term I'm looking for here is, but that's not quite it.  

But as far as finding your acceptance (and not necessarily love, as part of what makes Who great is the Doctor changes, and everyone can find a favorite) for Eleven - I really do recommend repeated watching.  And do it marathon style as much as possible...immersion isn't just for foreign languages.  

Even if you never *love* Eleven, you'll at least know and understand his quirks and be able to find your love for the show itself again.  :)",0,1348257616,null,0,false,0,c6bjc2e,t3_1091rx,t1_c6bjc2e,t1_c6bizvn,null,1429957343,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,keithb,eng-durham,Economic migrant from Durham in London,"It's pretty good. What is it for? This is a topic that confuses a lot of people. Some of them from the British Isles.

There are a few things that a British person might complain about: 

I'm pretty sure that the British Isles are in the north _west_ of Europe. Other islands in the north west include the Faroes and Iceland, neither of which is British.

If you are going to include Man then you should also include the States of Jersey and the States of Guernsey, which are likewise Crown Dependencies. 

The UK does not have states within it. It has constituent countries.

Great Britain is a purely geographical designation, the biggest island. It should have no flag or (as others have said) the Union Flag.

The nation of Ireland is just “Ireland”, not “The Republic of Ireland” although that's a common expression.

Anyone speaking to a person from Northern Ireland should be very careful about whether or not that person considers themselves “Irish” or “British” and should not make assumptions about it. There is risk of causing grave offence if you get it the wrong way round.

Strictly speaking, London is the capital city of the United Kingdom and England has no separate government or legislature (which  upsets some English people).

That seems like a lot of problems, but really you have done a pretty good job. I especially like that you have the map pointing in the right direction.

true,Monyet,null,null,"&gt; Every Judge bases their sentencing, within defined limits, on their personal beliefs.

This may well be the case, but (ideally) it is not meant to be. Instead judges are meant to make their decision on a range of factors unrelated to the judges personal opinions. Very briefly these are the circumstances of the case, statutory guidelines, impact on victim, mitigating circumstances (including guilty pleas and expressions of remorse). Of course this does tend to leave a great deal of room for manoeuvre and it is likely that almost every case reflects the opinions and prejudices of the sentencing judge to a certain degree. Once again, however, this is not the intent of the system.

&gt;You are just up-in-arms because you disagree with this belief.

Not really. To be honest I have much bigger issues to occupy my time with such as shall I have Marmite or honey on my toast. Think I'll go with Marmite.

&gt; Having beliefs does not disqualify one from being a judge.

Of course it doesn't, no one said it did. However, when judges express controversial opinions which appear to have affected their sentencing this is an issue and is thus rightly debated by the public. Similar debates have occurred when judges have expressed opinions which appear to laid the blame on rape victims for wearing revealing clothing, or just the other week when a judge described burglars as brave.

&gt;Neither does exercising discretion in the ways in which you are permitted to.

Pretty much the same as the first point. Judges can exercise discretion, but they are not meant to, in theory, base it on personal opinions.",0,1348259776,null,0,false,0,c6bjy67,t3_1099lr,t1_c6bjy67,t1_c6bi33p,null,1429957634,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Plus there's Vampires of Venice, where the Doctor accidentally shows his library card instead of the psychic paper, and the library card has the First Doctor's picture. And in Vincent and the Doctor when he tests the mirror contraption on himself, it identifies him and again shows a picture of the First Doctor.

There's also the fact that the last time the Doctor was in the old west - wearing a cowboy hat and a badge and a gun, even - was in 1966's The Gunfighters, where he (and Steven and Dodo) wind up being major participants in the events leading up to the shootout at the O.K. Corral.

* you have misspelled ""Britain"" as ""Britian"" throughout
* ""British Isles"" is not an uncontroversial term, particularly in Ireland.  Mention ""Isles of the North Atlantic""
* ""encompasses all northeast European islands"".
 * you mean northwest
 * and even then it's not true.  what about the Faroes?
* the UK does not have states; maddeningly there's no official term for the 4 different elements, but ""part"" or ""constituent countries"" tends to get used
* ""the British government represents United Kingdom, nothing more and nothing less""
 * not true, the British government represents the Isle of Man, Jersey, and Guernsey, and various overseas territories for foreign affairs
* ""South Ireland"" is not and has never been a name for anything and does not deserve to be bolded; the twenty-six counties were recognised by the British government as the independent ""Irish Free State"" in 1922, which then became known simple as ""Ireland"" in 1937 (and is often called the ""Republic of Ireland"")
* ""it changed to United Kingdom and Northern Ireland""
 * you missed out the ""Great Britain"" bit.
 * in fact, the name of the UK didn't change by adding ""Northern"" until 1927 and the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act, even though Ireland was independent
* ""the small islands are part of Scotland"" - there are also small islands that are part of Wales and England, and are visible on your map even (Anglesey and Wight)
* Why does the ""Great Britain"" part have the English flag?
* there is no mention of idea of geographical term ""Great Britain"", meaning the island.  the Acts of Union created the Kingdom of Great Britain, not the island.
* Republic of Ireland has the wrong independence date (should be 1922), and it is incorrectly saying ""free state under United Kingdom"".  It was an independent state from day 1.  Certainly nobody would say it ""became a country"" in 1937.  That's nonsense.  (it's *always* been a country, just one that wasn't independent)
* the ""Red Hand Flag"" you have shown for Northern Ireland is not a currently used flag.  You fail to capitalise ""Irish"" and ""British"" here, and use ""North Ireland"" interchangeably with ""Northern Ireland""
 * in fact, the split of Northern Ireland (1922) post-dates the declaration of Irish indepenence (1917)
* on your Scotland page, you tell us that Scotland united with England in 1707 to form the ""Kingdom of England"".  This is wrong, it should be the ""Kingdom of Great Britain""
* On the Wales page you again wrongly claim that Wales is a state (it's not), and that it is ""slowly becoming its own country"" (it already is a country).  Perhaps you mean that it is slowly moving towards independence?  But you make no such claim on the Scotland part, which is having an independence referendum in a couple of years time!

Notice that every regeneration of The Doctor is a male adult Caucasian (with a UK accent, to boot). The only major variation has been his apparent age, but *always* an adult over 30. Melody Pond, on the other hand, has had dramatic changes in age and ethnicity. Why has The Doctor not ended up Asian, or female, or 8 years old (or with a Boston accent, even)? Maybe because he didn't *want* to.

During one of his regenerations, The Doctor even commented that he was ""concentrating on a face"", implying that he had at least *some* influence over the process.

true,[deleted],null,null,"What does ""England is the capital country of the United Kingdom government"" mean? There's no such thing. I'm guessing you mean that the capital of the United Kingdom is in England? One of the most common errors people make is calling the UK England so I don't think that's really going to help matters.

Most of the errors have been pointed out by others - there's a couple more I don't think I've seen mentioned:

The terminology of the British Isles section is just plain confusing - having Ireland and the Isle of Man both as ""countries"" while Scotland, England, etc are ""States of the UK"" gives the impression that the Isle of Man is a sovereign state, which isn't true. Also I think you should change it to ""dependent **of** the UK"" rather than ""on"" or you'll upset some Manx people. Also saying that there are 3 governments in the British Isles is wrong and confusing - if you're going to include the Isle of Man government you should include the Scottish/Welsh/Northern Irish as well, or else it again gives the impression the Isle of Man is a sovereign state. I know they're not completely analogous but I think that's closer to the truth than the impression given currently.

I think the ""South Ireland"" and Act of Union creating Great Britain things have been covered below.

Saying all Northern Irish people are Irish...yeah. To keep it simple that's just not the case. As you note below, some may also identify as British, some as Northern Irish, but stating flat out (and in bold) that they are all Irish is just asking for trouble.

Scotland and England forming the Kingdom of England. Argh! Again, one of the most common errors is people calling the UK England, so if you're trying to stop that confusion this isn't a good way to do it!

The terminology in the Welsh one about being a state but slowly becoming a country is backward if you ask me - state implies sovereignty, to me at least.

As for Martha as a stand alone companion, one needs only to look to season three's The Last of the Timelords to see her value. She not only traverses the entire Earth in a single year alone during an oppressive madman's global paradox powered regime, she then has the courage to say no and goodbye to the very man she did the aforementioned traveling for. All because The Doctor was too much of an oblivious dick. Hooray to standing for yourself, a core tenet of Doctor Who.

Also it should be said that Martha is one of the few to actually bring The Doctor back to her.

true,raealistic,null,null,"I have seen Rose, Martha, and Donna. I maintain that they did not have the level of friendship-- a friendship of equals-- with The Doctor that the Ponds have experienced. 

Rose was a kid in love with The Doctor, and even though popular opinion seems to indicate that he also had feelings for her, I never bought it. 9 never seemed to show any particular romantic feelings for Rose, with the exception of the kiss-- which was a life-saving, intimate act, but not a romantic one. He never looked down on her but their interactions made it clear that they were on two different levels for many reasons (alien vs. human,  wise and experienced traveler vs young, emotional human). Some may point to the ""example"" of his feelings for her in their final episode together on the beach, where 10 leaves his clone counterpart ""to be what he could never be for her"" (or something to that effect), which still indicates to me that despite caring for her deeply, he remains detached from her in some way, unable to fill the alien gap that separates them emotionally, unable to see her *in that way*, unable to be the romantic love interest that she wants him to be. 

Martha Jones was never more than a rebound companion. I really enjoyed her character but she was never given the credit that she was due from The Doctor. He took her on because he wanted to play Mr. Impressive and needed someone else to look up to him. Even after she literally went to the end of the earth and back for him (well, and for the rest of the universe), he could never see her as a whole person. She was filled in on his situation on a need-to-know basis, and even after she left his company she was reprimanded by him for her choices and though he came when she called it could be argued that it isn't like he could ignore a call to save the world.

DoctorDonna is probably the closest that The Doctor has come to having a relationship of equals and honestly, my favorite companion. She brought him down a peg when he needed it and reminded him that he's not perfect or impenetrable. I feel like their relationship was more of colleagues and partners in crime (maybe DoctorDonna's chronic emphasis on her ""super temp"" status has something to do with it); she was in it for the journey, not for The Doctor. They grew to care for each other deeply, but I think the core of their relationship was a mutual love for the adventure. 

And then we have the Ponds-- Amy, The Girl Who Waited, and Rory ""Mr. Pond"" Williams. The fact that there are two of them (and eventually three) allows The Doctor to see them as more round characters, not merely as *his* companions. He is a part of their life in a way that he hasn't been a part of the lives of those that came before. He came back for Amelia Pond, he dragged them to Venice to save their marriage, sent them on a honeymoon, married their magically age-appropriate daughter. I don't think that The Doctor was even capable of that kind of emotional connection and intelligence in the past.

When it's put alongside ""Republic of Ireland, Country"", it makes it seem like they have the same status, which they don't. I think ""Crown Dependency"" is the accepted term for them.

And, to nitpick, I don't think saying that the British Isles has 5 different ""large"" governments is true either - the Governments of Jersey, etc are pretty tiny, and smaller than the Scottish one certainly. Maybe ""domestically sovereign"" would be better if you're not going to include Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

For the Great Britain section, most of the Scottish islands (including the actual Iona), the Isle of Man and Anglesea are coloured when they shouldn't be.

For the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey, I would note that they are not sovereign states - when you say they are their own country then it gives that impression, which isn't so.

The passport thing for Northern Ireland isn't right - they can choose either British or Irish citizenship, not *Northern* Irish citizenship.

To nitpick, again, it won't be the Scottish Government that makes a decision on independence in 2014, but the Scottish people through a referendum.

I'd say that Wales is slowly becoming **more** independent rather than slowly becoming independent - it isn't an inevitability.

Is it insulting?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural

&gt; The supernatural (Medieval Latin: supernātūrālis: supra ""above"" + naturalis ""nature"", first used: 1520–30 AD)[1][2] is that which is not subject to the laws of nature, or more figuratively, that which is said to exist above and beyond nature. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstition

&gt; Superstition is a belief in supernatural causality: that one event leads to the cause of another without any physical process linking the two events, such as astrology, omens, witchcraft, etc., that contradicts natural science.[1]

&gt; Opposition to superstition was a central concern of the intellectuals during the 18th century Age of Enlightenment. The philosophes at that time ridiculed any belief in miracles, revelation, magic, or the supernatural, as ""superstition,"" and typically included as well much of Christian doctrine

The the England Central bank allows you to keep it, I am very curious on how things turn out.


One of the main point would be to keep commodities produced local, but more importantly, services. If companies adhere to this project and start offering incentives to use their services (real estate agent, brickworks, plummers etc - lets say they give you a discount if you buy with Bristol Pound) it can pick off. This way more people will start using it and gain the benefits - which is win-win.


You need an electrical engineer, you get one from near by - he offers up a discount because he doesn't have to compete regionally with everybody, so he has steady demand on a steady market. You buy the same service, but cheaper. Hence the money circulates inside Bristol producing more revenue for people that use them


The downside is :
1. If it starts to pick off, you won't be allowed to keep it
2. It reduces your connection with global market which isn't always good.

Since Douglas Adams and Stephen Fry were close associates and friends, and John Lloyd and DA together wrote these similar books to Rich Hall, they probably have much in common and mutual admiration for each other, and he's a shoe-in for a cast member.

Is it depression or something? Autism? I know he never socialised with any LFC players, and I dont think he socialises with anyone at Chelsea either. Apparently at Liverpool he was known for pretending not to understand English so as to avoid speaking to people, i.e. when people were talking he pretended not to understand so wouldnt have to speak, only to speak perfectly fine English at other times, understanding complicated words and situations perfectly.

There's something clearly wrong with Torres' head. I honestly think he's autistic (genuine autistic, not 4chan autistic) or depressed or some kind of mental illness.

a) Online petitions are worthless tools that only serve to make armchair activists feel as though they're accomplishing something while not actually doing anything (sorry guys)

c) Business rates is fucked up.

* Defensively we were fairly solid, didn't give them much chances. Luiz once again the best defender in my books, his play has been very steady the past little while.
* Mikel and Ramires functioned very well in midfield, I really liked this combination. Good to see Ramires slot into the double pivot so well.
* Hazard and Oscar were quiet today. Oscar picked it up towards the end of the game but either could have been subbed off for Moses.
* Mata looks back in form, very encouraging to see.
* Torres quiet, starting to get really disappointed by him. Not having any alternatives for CF hurt us today, we would have put a lot more chances away with an in-form striker.
* Extremely happy with Moses. Added strength, directness, width to our attack, tracked back plenty and could throw a good challenge in too. Cannot overstate my satisfaction with him. I still think he should have started.

I thought that Ramires/Mikel in the double Pivot looked pretty good, though neither of them are superior passers. What Ramires provided that Lampard doesn't is the compact man-marking. But Lampard has the distributive passing we were lacking back there. But Ramires was better in transition, and moved the ball quickly from defense to attack. It's clear to see there are good pros and cons to playing either player. Mikel had a pretty solid game today, I thought, and even almost scored! The issue with the three midfielders (Oscar Mata Hazard), for me, was that all three like to get central. So it became quite simple for Stoke: Clog the middle, and they can't get around us. This is where Moses comes into play: I think he should have started today. The kid looks fantastic. That said, another great game for Oscar...making a case for consistent minutes. I'm ok with the Hazard sub - no man can play 90 minutes every game (which is why Lamps and Terry found the bench, I'd imagine). With all of that said, there's no excuse for Torres being as silent as he was. A good striker should pull defenders, make runs, and open up space behind him for midfielders in the center. He didn't do that at all today. Since the amazing goal at Newcastle he's been quiet.

Defense- So we can survive without Terry in the line, although it looked kinda shaky at times to me. Also, Cahill looked solid today. Maybe with some extra experience, we won't be as dependent on his leadership.

Lampard- Bringing him on as a late game power sub, when he could afford to play offensively, seemed to work. Also, without him constantly leaving Mikel isolated, our midfield seemed a lot stronger... Which brings me to...

Ramires- Gotta say, he played great with Mikel. I always saw him as a winger, but he was fantastic in the double pivot. Would definitely love to see him start there again over Lamps.

Oscar- I think he was trying to win fouls and the like such as Hazard can, but he looked way too theatrical doing it. Still a good game though. Maybe a little to quiet at first, and clogged the middle, but still, not bad.

Moses- Looked good, definitely brought a good change of pace to the game, especially when he started moving up the flanks. Hope to see him play more to see what else he can do.

Torres- Now, I can stand a great player with poor spirit, and I can love a decent one that bleeds blue, but Torres has shown only glimpses of this to me so far this season (Newcastle, Atl. Madrid). Admittedly, he seemed to be trying this game, and his spirit seemed to be in it, especially when Cole scored (running up and hugging and laughing. I seriously thought the guy forgot to be happy after Juve). He was at least trying to win balls and was challenging defenders (not doing a great job, but still attempting, not just walking with his head down). Also, at least when he saw that he couldn't do much with the ball, he passed instead of just losing it. Now if he could just get his touch on the ball when he's shooting right...

The Angels can still displace you in time, but they didn't need energy so they just killed people (which is just more vicious... they weren't even particularly that evil in their first appearance, they were just fighting for survival).

Also, the Angel 2-parter didn't ruin the looking thing. There were already many obvious cases of the Angels looking at each other in Blink.

Yes it can be salvaged and turned into something useful BUT in order for that to happen it needs a lot of money spent on it and there are very few uses the building could have that would allow the owners to recoup the money involved. Especially with the current reputation of Bradford. You may have a decent chance of getting enough from turning it into flats, offices, etc if it were in Leeds but it's in Bradford, in one of the worst insurance areas in the **country** (the overall worst being just up the road), next to the chavvy nightclubs.

I was sat on the right side near Boyce/Miyaichi (second half), and they were constantly in open space, but every time someone realised, we moved over far too slowly which gave fulham all the time in the world to react.

There were far too many crosses that were hit too long too, not just the ones into the box, but the ones that were hit too far when switching wings. Definitely need to work on those.

Koné could/should really have scored, but just knocked the ball too far before hitting it into the keeper when he was one-on-one. Glad he got one back in the closing minutes though.

We need to work on getting into the box, because we spent a frustrating amount of time just knocking it around before someone either lost the ball or Watson skied it.

I forgot that we hit the crossbar at some point too... dammit.

true,italboys,east-sussex,The Best Sussex,"There is no statutory 3 year warranty on hardware bought in the UK. The sale of goods act says that products must be as described and fit for purpose. Depending on the goods it is reasonable to expect to get a good coupe of years of use. If it fails in the expected life span due to manufacturing fault then you can have it repaired or replaced.

**Edit: Before you all start your downvote brigade, can you please hear me out? I posted an explanation below, but I'll just copy and paste here -**

Ok they spend a good proportion of time doing both. But I definitely think it's between 2016-2022 in Earth time, as Amy and Rory get dropped off in Autumn 2011 at the very earliest (The God Complex), do not see the Doctor for two years until Christmas 2013 (Xmas episode 2011), summer of phone calls from the Doctor (Pond Life) and then divorce in August 2014, Asylum of the Daleks late 2014, 8 months without the Doctor (again at the earliest, I'm under the impression we're missing a lot of on and off adventures), late 2015, at least another few months in between DoaS and ATCM, potentially 2016, more months after ATCM before The Power of Three.

But like I said, the episodes that are aired on TV are just a fraction of what adventures the TARDIS trio go through, many more get written in official books, comics, and audio, or those that aren't mentioned at all, so that means their have probably been many more months/years of dropping on and off, Rory going back to his part time Nursing job after being missing for several months at a time (just mentioned in this latest episode).",0,1348341919,null,0,1348345623,0,c6bx4me,t3_10b4hz,t1_c6bx4me,t1_c6bx0bi,null,1429963979,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

I presume this is activated as you walk through the door, like those air jets that keep the flies out of buildings. Now, as you brought up, there have been moments where the Doctor has feared the presence of disease (New Earth, Chen 7, etc). Now, I would imagine that, for brief exposure to disease, the TARDIS can burn out the pathogen, however, with certain diseases, allowing the spread into the body prevents the TARDIS from properly removing the critters, hence leaving individuals sterile unable to pass on the disease, but still effected on a cellular level. 

I think it's reasonable to presume such a system would be able to selectively hit certain bacteria, because, as we know, Time Lords have certain bacterial payloads that are required for life, and as such ensure that only harmful bacteria are removed, and moreover, only bacteria harmful to the individual creature are harmed.

But like I said, the episodes that are aired on TV are just a fraction of what adventures the TARDIS trio go through, many more get written in official books, comics, and audio, or those that aren't mentioned at all, so that means their have probably been many more months/years of dropping on and off, Rory going back to his part time Nursing job after being missing for several months at a time (just mentioned in this latest episode).",0,1348345211,null,0,false,0,c6bxryx,t3_10b4hz,t1_c6bxryx,t1_c6bxg7w,null,1429964285,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Halfway through the conductor comes around the completely empty train to check the tickets and refuses mine as my £60 ticket as apparently I have an off-peak ticket. Now, there was only one ""day return"" ticket option on the machine (I religiously checked, I travel a lot), no notification at the station that this was a ""peak"" train despite being empty and 7am leaving London.

Twat made me pay £80 for a single from London, again, or would force me to get off at the next tiny station in the middle of nowhere.

Got home and called Virgin and apparently I should have checked online what trains are ""peak"" and what aren't or gone hunting for some notice board which wasn't anywhere obviously in my path at the station as they have no requirement to label tickets properly at the machines. Seriously, that was their reply.

So, fuck that particular train guard. and fuck Virgin.

I've also been dumped at some tiny station in the midlands at 3am after a Virgin train broke down for 6-7 hours and then had to argue with some Virgin moron that they owe me a cab after they tried to leave me at the station. Got a £300 taxi ride home though, which was fun.

I also like the ""you've paid £70 for a ticket, but there are no seats and the only place to stand is in the doorway to the stinking toilet"" routine, which has happened several times.

I then had to wait 10 days to get it back - called their 3 'helpline' numbers over 50 times and never got a response. Finally I turned up at the shop and it was closed for a random religious holiday. Then I went in again on Friday and the guy said it will only be ready on Monday. I asked to speak to the manager who after some checking said it was already done! Compare this to service in the for my previous laptop where I had a 30 min diagnosis call and then an engineer showed up at my house the next morning and fixed the issue within the hour!

There's no movement in the background and in fact, after Amy and Rory return, you can actually still see people lying on the platforms behind them as the Doctor walks around the console.

There is no time post the conversation for them to do this as they all stand together. In fact, you can still see people unconscious when he tells Amy and Rory to run.

You're right that the money has to be recouped, but I don't know enough about rail economics to make any pronouncements on it. For one thing, I will not be believing any of the tripe Virgin is coming out with in its press releases and other PR.

Their PR and scaremongering is first class (excuse the pun), they really do have people thinking that First is busy selecting the finest steam trains for use from the 10th of December among other falsehoods. 

They also like to go on about how brilliant they are, well I'd hope so given the money the taxpayer has thrown at them with shiny new trains and constant track upgrades. A similar First franchise (First Great Western's intercity operation) is still running 40 year old HSTs across an area where parts of the infrastructure dates from the Victorian era, untouched except for maintenance from when Brunel put it all in. I'd say they do a reasonable job within the constraints of minimal investment. (personally I don't mind the older HSTs but some people like shiny trains)

None of First's franchises (except Hull Trains) are a purely intercity service. It doesn't help public perception for them when people climb onto a shit Pacer on some rural branchline in Devon or a class 150 in Cornwall. It has First Great Western written down the side, so if the train is a rattlebox then that's who is to blame. 

Virgin's franchise is purely intercity, with intercity class trains and fares to match. No wonder then that people love them because Virgin aren't having to deal with the nitty gritty of commuter travel on less luxurious trains.

I think out best bet would be to have Sandro man-mark Granero to keep him out of the game. Dembele can fight Faurlin farther up field but without Granero I think they lose a lot of creativity.

First off, we find out the Brigadier had a daughter and is now the head of UNIT, which I found absolutely wonderful, and heart warming.  
   
Secondly, the focus of the episode wasn't the baddie of the week, this was a MAJOR character development of The Doctor, Amy, and Rory. We start off with Amy and Rory actually settle in their own lives, and actually enjoy it. But then here comes The Doctor interrupting them as usual. And through the course of events of the invasion of the cubes, Amy and Rory finally realize that their place is with The Doctor. Also, we come to find out that The Doctor can't exactly live without them either. With his reasoning being that Amy was the first person he met in his newest incarnation. Which was kind of an ""aww"" moment for me.   
  
Of course, we all know where this is heading.. Amy and Rory are leaving The Doctor forever. I dunno how exactly.. but it's going to happen. This episode was a major build up to that fact, and we know its going to majorly affect The Doctor.

More will be explained for those complaining that you didn't get enough of back story of the invaders. You weren't suppose to, this episode was meant to leave you with questions.

These new signings need to settle in, we still haven't even come close to figuring out an ideal formation or an ideal rotation, Marin has yet to feature in the BPL, we're still unsure just where Oscar will ultimately fit, where Lamps will play, how Romeu will factor in; I could go on. There are a lot of unsettled factors, and that inevitably contributes to how Torres performs. The other side of the coin is that, for a world class striker, that wouldn't and shouldn't matter. If he gets the ball in the danger area, there will be a goal scoring opportunity created, no matter what. And Torres certainly hasn't been that for us. So it's a bit of a rock and a hard place sort of thing. I think people need to move beyond the 50m Pounds bit - that's done with, he's here now, it's media punditry.

I don't follow OOC stuff too much, so if these things have been said to be hoaxes, I don't know. 

I do think the 50th will be much more, but an important part of the Answer to ""Doctor Who?"" is ""The Moment"". The doctor of the classic series operates differently than the doctor of the new series. Something changed him. And I don't just mean regeneration.

As for season 8, yeah, that makes sense. But I think that all of 13 will be a 50th extravaganza. I mean, Spider-Man has already started their 50th celebration, and it was the same year. I might just be a half-season early.

And the time war being mentioned by name isn't significant. It still happened, it's a huge plot hole that deserves to be filled, and the only regeneration we haven't seen. It would be silly to not use it.

Now, I can agree that it's still early in the season, and later on will show who is more likely to finish top 3 and bottom 3, but we're now 2nd!  If ever there was a week for Everton to be shown first, it would be this one... We had the lunch-time kick-off, and won with three away goals.  But, instead, we're shown after Soton's 4-1 home win.

Maybe I'm reading too much into this; I think I've seen this too many times over too many previous seasons, and just thought now might be an ideal time to ask the question.

Because the episode had a non-action focus does NOT excuse the sloppy resolution. The episode AS A WHOLE needs to be up to par. If you can't work in characterization while STILL delivering an excellent Who episode then you should NOT be characterizing like this.

This episode was not just characterization though. It was also about those damn cubes. A HUGE portion of episode time is devote to OMG CUBE INVASION and as such is deserving or a proper resolution.

Even if you were to excuse the episode because the focus was on characterizing the Doctor and the Ponds by showing them in every day situations it was done poorly.

It's really not as simple as this video makes out. I was recently in attendance at a court case where a nasty anti-abortion group were on trial for showing obscene foetus gore outside a local abortion clinic. The law explicitly says that *offence* is allowed, however it becomes an issue when it becomes harassment or intimidation. These things, legally, are very different, but the law as it stands does protect our right offend, for instance, showing horrific photos of an Israeli attack on Palestinians, or showing mutilated animals at an animal right's centre.

It also must further be proved that the *intent* was to distress or offend, as opposed to simply someone happening to be offended by said images.

http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64


It was for these reasons that unfortunately the defence won the case and these nutters feel like they have the green light to show their bile outside the centre.

...that's actually the whole point of building it. It's a sound sculpture!

All the buttons and knobs and other stuff are wired into a MIDI brain hooked up to a Mac Mini inside. The MIDI controls are routed to Ableton Live to trigger sounds, samples, lights, etc.

It's designed to have 6 speakers surrounding it and a subwoofer inside. There's also a little speaker box on the console itself so it's kinda like 7.1 surround sound, but making actual surround work is kinda tricky.

I gotta get more wiring done and then work up a blog post about all the electronics and whatnot inside.

&gt;[He] felt that one series isn’t enough to get under the skin of the character and that if he’d had two or three series he’d have developed the role considerably.

&gt;He said that if you looked at the other Doctors (with the exception of Tom Baker) you can see them working out how to play the character through their first series because it’s such a complex and challenging role.

Eccleston was admitting that he didn't take the role as far as he could have, not that he left the role with unfinished business. He was really only talking about how deep the role is and that he didn't have enough time to do a thorough job of it. I wish he would come back so we could see 8-9 but I doubt that's going to happen.

true,DeusJZ,tardis,TARDIS,"Actually, that falls into another full conundrum in itself. If an angel is unaware of being observed, does the quantum state of the angel change?

The answer? Yes and no.

Quantum mechanics has normally referred to certain particles changing states, movement, and sometimes even content when observed, which is the most evident in the well-known [Two-slit experiment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu57B1v0SzI). This is the basic fundamental law of existence that the weeping angles are based from. Changing quantum states while observed by others. However, the change from being observed is still not completely documented. Scientists had used a certain way to monitor the particles, essentially measuring using distortion of a certain field to gain data, much like ""sensing"" the particle, not recording with a camera. Therefore, these senses distort the possible path, controlling it into two states. (Left slit, right slit)

Subjectively, applying this to the angels, the quantum-state locks are two-states: Stone and not stone. Viewing them changes their state. Or does it? In the Crash of the Byzantium, Amy has her eyes closed. Yet, they're still stone. She's partially aware that the Angels are near her, without seeing them, and yet, they are still stone and frozen. She's still observing them through different means. Humans have the sense of proximity, which technically does count as observation of something, giving off a small field of distortion. Technically, by believing that angels are around her, Amy observes the angels around her, turning them to stone via the quantum state change.

Now, the question remains that makes me say that they may be able to move if they aren't aware of being observed: Is the quantum connection run both ways? The only fact that begs this question is that the angels are stone, and then start to move when they realize Amy can't see. They may be able to move so long as they are not aware of another observer if they turn to stone despite chasing someone who's blindly unaware.

A Whip is far more important than you would think and to be told off by a police officer at Downing St I can see as being a real piss take to this guy. Notice the treasonous Kenneth Clark is right at his side, Clarke being a very high-level member of the Bilderberg Group. Clarke was also the real Tory power through the still highly powerful but veiled Lord High Chancellor position which Chris Grayling now holds. A singular position as with the Lord President of the Council which is higher than Cameron’s position which is a collective.

My point was that the villains weren't the point of the episode. The times when they were talking about their relationship was during the parts inbetween dealing with the villain and was very integral to the overall plot of these past 4 episodes. And I honestly don't know how they could have ""shown"" it like you said... This isn't a book, it's a show.. you actually have to spell out things for the audience. Especially since this show is aimed toward a younger audience.. With that in mind..   
  
In terms of a realistic outcome like you are suggesting that should have happened... how well do you think having a third of Earth's population dying would have gone over? Writers have to take into account their audience and take liberties when they can.. like say... having The Doctor *save* all those people instead of having them die instantly. As for the people on the ship.. well, they didn't exactly have time to save them did they? And of course they weren't mentioned to spare the audience (the kiddies).

They weren't defeated either.. just set back. They are still very much out there and apparently hellbent on destroying the humanity, and now they know they are dealing with The Doctor (whether or not they actually know who he is, I dunno) but they will be better prepared next time.
