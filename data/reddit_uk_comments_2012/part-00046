The fact is that huge swathes of council estates are filled with lazy arsed people that have never worked a day in their lives and there is, for good and for bad reasons, resentment. In many ways for no fault of their own they find themselves in this quandary. If you grow up in a house where 2 or more generations have never worked, the impetus to find work yourself is less likely. Changing this mindset will take a long time but change is needed. 

Just for the record: I spent 6 years as a council letting officer and saw several thousand properties; both tenanted and vacated. The conditions on the whole were pretty atrocious. This said there are loads of hard working long time tenanted properties that I would never have seen.

I never did say that people who use it officially are incorrect.

The study linked to above, and the lack of understanding to which I was referring, pertain to British **people**. When people on mainland UK state that the 'British people' does not include those who identify themselves as British in Northern Ireland, then they are incorrect in their definition. According to [this survey](http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2009/Community_Relations/NINATID.html), 35% of NI citizens consider themselves British; therefore a definition which simply states that Northern Ireland does not contribute to the sum of British people, is incorrect. It is not very surprising that this misconception exists when the majority of information about Northern Ireland available to people in Great Britain is negative, and more often than not the people are discussed in terms of religion, rather than nationality.

According to the above survey , 32% identify as Irish; there is no problem with them describing themselves as Irish, and coming from Ireland, any more than there is the other third calling themselves British and coming from Britain. 

When discussing nationality and 'homeland' (read; outwith legal matters), pigeonholing the area of Northern Ireland into its legal terms and definitions is meaningless and pointless, (no matter how correct it may be). It is the people who decide where they come from, not the map, not legal documents. 

All the legal definitions and geo-political technicalities are not what are important; people are what matter. No matter how long people bang on about how NI is part of the UK, and calling it part of Britain is incorrect, nothing gives anyone the power, or the right, to stop people deciding for themselves where they come from and who they are.

In any case, 'Britain' does not technically exist at all, and may refer to the United Kingdom or Great Britain, and therefore it's use in Northern Ireland cannot be incorrect, especially if it is widely accepted.",0,1335004012,null,0,true,0,c4eva1p,t3_sjl94,t1_c4eva1p,t1_c4eqtxl,null,1428766470,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

Parkwood. I've really enjoyed my year there so far, Ingram is about 5 mins away from the laundry/admin/shop/bar area. Woodies bar is really close and a great vibe (also ¬£1.75 pints with a discount card).
You're in the party central for house parties, and it is so nice to be living in a house rather than a flat, you get a far more homely vibe, and if you're a bit more withdrawn you can make some really close friends without feeling too pushed out of your own space.

The rooms are nice and sizeable, my house has a sink in every room, although I hear this varies. I share my house with 6 people, and are very close with two of them (living with one in our own housing next year).

The kitchens vary, but all in all are very nice, the more 'recent' houses have much prettier ones. You share a microwave, kettle and fan oven/grill/hob combo with all your housemates, which can be really nice if you like sharing meals and cooking with/for other folks. Facilities like washers and dryers are found at the start of the housing area, which sucks if you're on the edge of Parkwood like the Girmshill folks, but if you're Lypeatte, life is good!

You may be a little further from campus than some folk, but we get a very pretty woodland walk on the way to class. Parkwood is also pretty cheap and good value IMO.

The only downside is that you lack any sort of common room, relying on your kitchen to meet up in/predrink in, but I don't think the flats have this option either, Tyler doesn't. Also we have to rely on laptops being wired in for internet access, although I hear we're all getting wireless next year! (almost makes that ¬£9k tuition fee worth while, right? ;D)

He isn't a player who can play the route one ball; certainly not as well as Drogba, anyway. I can feel that you are getting ready to jump on that statement and say, 'well, he's been here a while, he should have adjusted his game!' or something like that. Don't. 

Players don't change their styles that easy. Can you ask Messi to start heading all his goals from crosses and chesting down long balls? Can you ask Drogba to receive a ball on midfield, thread through defenders and score? I doubt it. Asking a player to change his style is like asking a right-handed person to use ONLY his left hand. You might eventually achieve some level of 'competence' but you won't be a 'natural' at it. 

Each player has a style of play and unfortunately Torres' style is mismatched with the rest of the team. He needs someone like Mata to play the midfield so he can receive that final pass. Most of his goals this season have had a creative player (usually Mata) involved in the build-up. It also didn't help that Kalou, Sturridge and Malouda were as lost as babes in the village fair. Their abysmal passing in the final third coupled with Arsenals speedy defense added to that frustration.

Now if you want to talk about bad performances up front, WTF were Kalou and Torres doing? Our front three was absolutely horrible today despite being fed with a number of chances from midfield. It is saying something when we get five or six great balls over the top and hardly manage shots, let alone shots on target.

EDIT: Just for the record, [here are Malouda's statistics according to whoscored.com](http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/507153/LiveStatistics/England-Premier-League-2011-2012-Arsenal-Chelsea): 1 shot, not on target; led the team in Key Passes with 5 (as in 2.5 times the next closest players, Torres and Kalou, and one of only 4 players with any key passes); drew 3 fouls; dispossessed 4 times (sounds bad until you compare it with Sturridge who was dispossessed 9 times); only 1 turnover; 5 successful tackles; 88% pass accuracy on 49 passes, the most in the squad. Also the highest player rating on Chelsea with a 7.7.

It also begs the question: ""Why is it that we indulged in Torres' bad form but we curse Sturridge selfishness?""

I disagree. I think our politics is entirely about the Nationalist and Unionist divide. Ironically, I much preferred direct rule, because things actually got done. The amount of bickering and in-fighting that has been born of devolved Stormont, I believe, has not been worth it.

I have nothing personal against Unionists. Which, I think, is the main problem here. Nothing can be sat down and worked out because people keep taking things personally, and being tribal. I'm a nationalist despite being brought up in a home where I was never encouraged to be either. 

I believe that if a United Ireland is to work, we should take all that is good about Northern and Southern Ireland, and combine them, and get rid of all the bullshit. 

I honestly think that if the Unionist element of the 1910s had conceded to Home Rule, we'd have had a complete Irish Republic by now. And I'd have welcomed their influence, because they would probably have counteracted the influence of the Catholic Church. We could have had a fairer country, that ruled itself, rather than one part ruled by London, and the other ruled by Rome.

If we could afford a United Ireland, I think we could afford Universal Healthcare for all of Ireland. And many other things.

true,a113er,null,null,"Yeh, you're on to something there. I kind of hate the Daleks, I find them to be the most boring villains along with the Cybermen. I've been scared by The Empty Child back in the day and sometimes by Weeping Angels but I have no fear of Daleks. It might just be that even before new Who came out I was very aware of them due to popular culture or because by the time i saw them on TV i'd seen actually scary horror films. 

Regarding why I find them uninteresting: They are overused and pretty much have one motivation. Any episode with Daleks goes the exact same way. First they unveil themselves even though they had previously been destroyed forever during the last encounter with the Doctor. Secondly we learn their diabolical plan that will destroy everything and a minor character or two (usually introduced that episode) will be zapped. Then they are completely destroyed again, only to return another day. 

I also find the constant returning of the Daleks really annoying because it almost makes the Doctor's sacrifice during the Time War have less meaning. In 'Dalek' it worked because he was dealing with having destroyed two complete races and was now having to face that decision again. But now the Daleks are everywhere so basically all he did was kill all his entire race and not stop the bad guys at all really. It would be interesting if they actually made the Doctor deal with the fact that he exterminated his planet and race without coming close to stopping the Daleks. Instead we'll just get an episode with the Daleks in a slightly different context or maybe paired with a different alien race than before. 

EDIT: Another point on why they are not scary: To escape, one needs to stroll away. They are glorified rc vehicles with a plunger and pole on them. Their voice may have once been scary but they've been heard so much that they sound as familiar as the sonic screwdriver. They are also a sad reminder that the new series has milked the aliens of the old series to death. I love episodes with original villains, I wish they would stick to that.

The trick to making the Daleks scary, in my view, is to lull the audience into a false sense of security based on how fundamentally goofy they are...  and then have them do something *utterly* depraved and horrifying.  I thought the #9 ""Dalek"" did this very well.  You thought the Dalek was just a cute l'il robot, until he slaughters an entire platoon mercilessly, complete with an electrocution trick.

And that goes back to their first appearance.  The slow pace, I think, somewhat obscures just what they're trying to pull.  Having come to realize that their existence *relies* on radiation, clearly, the solution is to just deliberately irradiate the entire planet.  Problem solved, and all other species exterminated to boot.

What makes them scary is that they're unpredictable.  They're nazis with the disposition of spoiled 5-year-olds.  If you've got something they want, when written well, they will do fucking **anything** to get it, and with a fair dose of ""death before dishonor"" to boot.

I'm talking about placing bets where you have an indisputable mathematical edge over the house. These are far more common than people realise, because nobody thinks to look. You're all so busy sneering at the idiots who gamble their money that you never bother working out under what conditions you can beat the house.

The best part is, people are so confident that they are right that they won't even bother checking up on the concept after reading this. They will dismiss me as deluded and carry on passing up on free money. It doesn't even matter if you tell them exactly how to do it and explain the maths to them, they have such an ingrained image of anybody who ever placed a bet as a happy-go-lucky moron in piss-stained trousers wasting his rent that they don't hear it.

You mean you're American. It's okay to say that you know. I went to Uni with four Americans, and they all had a great time. 

&gt; My impression is that apart from the 'sarcastic, cynical' stereotypes of UK humour, US jokes have punchlines, whereas UK humour is more constantly hilarious, if it makes any sense.

I wouldn't say we were sarcastic, but we are slightly cynical. Those are not the same things, you know. Much more so than Americans I suppose. IMO UK humour is based on three things, wit, mockery, and the absurd.

There are ways of guaranteeing that you'll make money off a series of bets. They are just extremely rare because bookies are quite good at keeping their odds close together today. Also the margins are too tight to really be worth bothering with. I think it was Wales V England in the 6N where I could guarantee a 0.5% return on whatever I bet*.

The bookies don't have to guarantee that they win. They just need to make sure the safe methods has a lower return on investment than working for McDonalds.

That is the same of any business who has all their eggs in one basket no matter what name is on that basket. When ABI Caravans closed in Beverley, some of their suppliers went bust because ABI were their only customer.

If farmers have the supermarkets as their only customers then thats their fault. There is enough tonnage going through places like Smithfield Market that comes from overseas which could be supplied from the UK instead that farmers don't have to have supermarkets as their sole customers.

When you have more than one customer then when someone like Tesco comes along and tries to take down your trousers you can tell them that the price is the price and they can pay it or you'll sell it to someone else. If Tesco know they are your only customer or virtually as good as, they get to dictate the price. Its like selling a classic car. If its a very sought after one and you've a couple of dozen people interested in it, the price is the price you advertise or may even be above that if they start bidding against each other. If its one with very few people interested in it, the price is what you'll let yourself be bid down to.

&gt;  They aren't even passing on the savings; one dairy farmer wrote about how he only got 1p per extra per litre compared to the prices Tesco paid in 1997 - it's gone up by around 38p per litre on the shelf in that timeframe. Fuck the lot of them. Greedy pigs.

Slight problem with that and thats the farmers don't sell to Tesco and never have. They sell to the processors such as Arla Foods, Wisemans and the like. Arla Foods and Wiseman Dairies sell to Tesco. So if they're only getting paid 1p more it is because that is what Arla and Wisemans are paying them, not Tesco.

More depth in the squad and more rotation, to be able to actually keep good players for every position - twice. Untill we can do that, our form will, again and again, go south at the end of the season. It's such a shame, that the good, exciting football of earlier this season, quite possibly is entirely lost by now. Getting a Europa League ticket isn't even a sure thing.

Illegal things are impossible to buy, aren't they? And those laws were rarely enforced over the past few decades anyway, even before the internet.

&gt;Seriously? All I said was that an opt in ISP block would be a handy tool for parents. Not saying porn is wrong, not saying ban any of it, not saying it should be switched off as a default, not saying children won't be curious.

Exactly what do you think it would achieve? It's easy to get past those things, it can be done in literally five minutes. This information would be passed around school and the system would be made utterly useless very quickly.

And even if, hypothetically, there was a perfect system which did work, what would *that* achieve, in your opinion?

&gt;Right, so parents shouldn't stop their children from doing or having anything then by that logic? That'll work out just fine.

true,p7r,uk,United Kingdom,"I lived for quite a while - probably about a year - as a professional gambler after the dot.com crash where a developer like me was near unemployable. I gave up when I realised I was just moving money around and not making anything of value with my life. As such, I can *kind of* understand what might be going on here:

1. They have a winning bet from the day before they only just spotted, and they want the money. I've had a ¬£500 slip in my pocket all night worrying me: it's not your cash until it's been counted out. High street bookies are one of the last places you can get a decent ""multiples"" bet, so for 50p stakes you can win tens of thousands (although for dull mathematical reasons I won't go into now this is the biggest rip-off of them all).

2. They have seen an early price for a horse/team they want to bet on, and want to get it before it's gone, but don't have the means (i.e. a debit or credit card) to ""get on"" at that price online or on the phones

3. There is an event they want to bet on that will be starting at 9.05am perhaps (e.g. Australian horse racing) and they want to make sure they're on.

It might make you feel better to sneer at them, and to ridicule them, but there are plenty of gamblers who aren't degenerate addicts or idiots and who enjoy this as a genuinely intellectually challenging past-time. 

Mind you, most of *that* crowd these days are on the exchanges, and wouldn't be seen dead in a bookies. I dislike them, but they remind me of those early winters in my betting career in Fallowfield drinking weak tea and getting a love for racing over the sticks. 

When I was doing it ""professionally"", I would sometimes pop in for big races, but I was nearly exclusively in front of a screen or on the course.

I would argue that perhaps some of the players you ahve right now think they're above the club. Gareth Bale has been a spurs icon for the past few  months, but i feel that at the moment he's deviated from what he's at the club to do. When he was a dynamite left winger (thinking back to AC milan game) he was out and out spurs' most consistent and best performer. But he seems to have taken it upon himself to become a kind of lone ranger lionel messi type midfielder, the number of times i have seen him drifting into the centre to pick up the ball and trying to play as an attacking midfielder has really restricted the width. I noticed in the game at the emirates that without lennon or bale effective on the wings, spurs was all through play. And after 2-0 i think maybe 3 of our goals came down the flanks by exposing the full backs with open space in the wide areas.
Also i'm not sure if the problem with the depth in the squad is a problem with Harry or more jsut the club structure. I think one of the key problems for spurs is the revenue stream, they are out and out one of the biggest clubs by supporter numbers in the country, but with a relatively small ground the ticket income can't be large. Couple that with the skin tight wage budget set by levy and i think Harry has taken somewhat of a risk by blowing the budget on high wage players (modric, VDV, potentially ade) and have sacrificed a few bench options",0,1335034946,null,0,true,0,c4ez0tv,t3_slk2k,t1_c4ez0tv,t1_c4eyw18,null,1428768222,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

The thing is, in our history, when we have worked together (north and south) and realised we are siblings rather than enemies its worked pretty well.  

I think first and foremost, unionists need to realise that being an irishman is not mutually exclusive to being an ulsterman or a british citizen.  I think it changed things for me when I realised that myself... though you realise it quicker when you work in England 5 days a week.

1) England Job. We've won 1 in the last 13ish EPL games since Capello resigned/got sacked. This is not neccessarily Harry going off the boil, but the negative, uncertain mentality throughout the squad.

2) burn out. Most of the form we had early in the season came from playing the same 11 players week in week out. This is all good at the time, but without any sort of rotation, you get natural burn out. Modric and Bale especially have been kicked to shit in recent seasons, without a break.

The Tory methodology keeps debt growing without even growing GDP. With falling GDP due to inaction and growing debt due to this headline dodging we're getting further into a mess. The Tories need to pick their solution and follow through. Not change their mind every 3 months.

Whenever someone say ‚ÄúI want more diversity‚Äù they really mean ‚ÄúI want less white people.‚Äù ‚ÄúDiversity‚Äù is a code word for white ethnic cleansing.

true,keizersozei,flair5,,"Ok so for arguments sake, I'm going to agree with your theory on rigidity. Although rather than rigidity, I think the strength that Harry has is to play the right players in the correct positions, and more importantly, let them play the way they are capable of. e.g. He played Modric in the centre when he first started at Spurs, even though Modders was almost permanantly playing on the left because we didn't have anyone else who could play on the left naturally. Modric 'did a job' in that position, but Harry saw what he was capable in the centre of the pitch. Now he's world class. Similar with Bale. 

&gt;has one or more top goalscorers who are fed from the whole team playing as one.

I didn't realigiously watch Redknapps games at Portsmouth and Westham, but this isn't really the case at Spurs. I understand that he's put players in their natural positions, and told them to feed each other and 'have a go' at goal. I few weeks ago, we had taken more shots from outside the box than any other team in the Prem by some distance. I don't know if this is the case now, but we haven't had a talisman type player since Berbatov really (not a sly dig at Arsenal btw). 

All of this disagreement aside, I whole heartedly agree with you about Bayor. Many, many, MANY pundits/writers/ex-players have comented on Bayor's ability to have an increadable debut season for a club. Together with the fact that he's playing in the shop window (in order to attract a club for next season) means at the very least, he's not going to be as good next season if he stays/signs for Spurs. Let's not get it twisted though, he's been phenominal for us. I'm sure you're used to being frustrated by Ade constantly when he used to play for you? It's the same with us. Althought the difference is that somehow he's not offside most of the game, and he's become weak at shooting. However, he has adjusted his game (possibly through Redknapp instructions) to create more goals than he scores. We've been crying (sometimes literally) for an all-round target man like Bayor the past 4ish seasons, and we've finally got a player who fits the mould. 

We've been waiting to break the bank for a striker for some time now, and I doubt we'll get anyone of any real quality until Harry leaves, and his replacement can choose who to splash the cash on. Just in case Mourinho doesn't like Bayor......",0,1335040569,null,0,false,0,c4f00k8,t3_slk2k,t1_c4f00k8,t1_c4ezb6h,null,1428768757,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

I don't think him and Torres have the best of relationships, that's how it comes across on the pitch anyway, but his use of the ball was dreadful. At the start of the season he was happy to get games and played well because of that, now he seems to have lost that attitude and his performances have become really unprofessional /rant.
Back to Torres, I was disappointed, Drogba really took his chance when he started against Spurs, I thought both were in similar form leading to that game. But Torres couldn't replicate that kind of performance and after an entire season at the club, his performances haven't really improved from the opener against Stoke.

Fuck I could read you out a laundry list full of players that we were heavily linked with who ended up at Real, Barca, Man City etc etc. I'm not trying to have a go, but speculation is a dangerous game.

OK in terms of development and structure, I'm going to have to agree and disagree. Yes, clubs like Arsenal and Southampton (the king of youth development in England) have a great development system where they actively look to develop their youth. 

I have to correct you about a few players though. Ben Arfa: was tearing it up in the French league 1 since 2004 for Lyon (usually French champions) and Marseille (the other French team who normally qualify for Champs league. He's been at Newcastle for less than 2 years. They didn't develop him. Papiss Cisse, has played for 5 clubs in the senior team before **arriving at Newcastle a few months ago**. He was prolific at all 5 clubs. He didn't 'develop' at Newcastler he's just been able to carry on his amazing form. Cabaye is also another player who signed for Newcastle in 2011 - wasn't 'developed' by Newcastle. Ba has been prolific since 2005 for various teams in Europe. Westham had him for half a year until they were relegated, and he was prolific for them also. He signed for Newcastle in 2011 - wasn't 'raised' from nothing. Don't get me wrong, they're all wonderful players that you've named. They're just not the right example to use for your argument.

&gt; this squad you have is the one that got you to where you are

I hope I'm missing the sub-text here because we've changed our squad (more so our starting 11) relatively drastically in the past 2 transfer windows, with big changes pretty much every summer. Remember we qualified for the Champs with a starting 11 including Dawson, Huddlestone, Crouch, Palacios, Corluka, Hutton, Gomez, Pav, Bassong etc. These players played a pretty big part in our team, and for 1 reason or another, They're not with us/have not been playable. This season alone, we've played Brad, Parker, Kyle Walker and Bayor pretty much every week of the season, even though they weren't Spurs players until September.

true,bluedishwasher,null,null,"Thank you for your very interesting and detailed response.

Firstly, regarding portsmouth and west ham. While HArry was there he always had a ""go to man"" - the kind of player that he would throw on and they would nab that decisive goal. In that sense it was benjani/kanu at portsmouth and in the 90's/00's the likes of morley, cottee, di canio at west ham. That's a position i feel tottenham are really lacking. With the failure of Darren Bent, there hasn't been (as you said) anyone to fill the void of Keane/Berbs who were unstoppable a few years ago. I think Ade was astute as a loan signing with city stumping up 175k a week for the honour, however long term i really don't think it's viable. It must be said that he has created far more chances than he ever did at arsenal/man city where he was somewhat renound for his selfish style of play - that's been impressive. But I still feel like spurs need that threat in the final third, having looked through your subreddit it seems evident a number of fans are upset with the lack of sting in the final third.
Also, I think spurs are having a dry patch like we did near the start of the year, and i think a lot of the ""harry out"" stuff is very misguided and brash. No offence intended, but spurs would be nowhere near where they are today without him. And as you rightly mentioned, he has a knack of getting the best from a player, and is a very good developer of all round players through moving them around the pitch - something wenger is doing at the minute with the likes of Ramsey etc. I think Harry has a proven track record of delivering top quality players (lampard, ferdinand, di canio at west ham for instance) and i don't think spurs joining the billionaire boys club and splashing out in a few months is going to expedite some kind of quick transition.

It seems to me the main problem is that you have a lot of confidence players. Some of the key players jsut don't have the gusto to dust themselves down after a 5-1 defeat at wembley and bounce back with a win next game. Of course, that would be incredibly tough for any team. But as the old saying goes, the team needs experience. Off the top of my head, only a handful of players in the squad have ever played at a consistent top 4 level (e.g. adebayor) and apart from 2 years ago there isn't really any CL experience in the squad. I think spurs just need a new anchor man, someone to help rebuild the squad and tie up all the more mentally frail players",0,1335042088,null,0,false,0,c4f09tc,t3_slk2k,t1_c4f09tc,t1_c4f00k8,null,1428768878,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,bluedishwasher,null,null,"When i mentioned development, i wasn't necessarily talking about youth (although obviously in the case of southampton..) but rather taking a talent and moulding him to the premier league/the team's particular style of play. And in the case of newcastle, Arfa has transformed as a player. Of course, he was very effective at both lyon and marseille ( played in the same team as na$ri i believe) - however his style of play has totally changed. In the french leagues he would frequently play through the centre, whereas Pardew has affixed him to more of a roaming right wing role, and as a result his goal stats have shot up. Similarly, Ba and Cisse - although consistent performers at other clubs - have not played at anything like the level they are currently. Ba as well, failed a medical at Stoke and was a consistent performer in a pretty much championship level west ham team. So what i was trying to illustrate was that smart purchases have been brought in in that instance and have been developed beyond youth to excel in the prem league - something evident by both ba and cisse's scoring records. Anyway, I understand your point of view on that and concede that it was worded poorly in my response, but i hope you see what i am trying to say

Secondly, when i say snubbed i mean out and out said they would not like to play for arsenal and went on a big money transfer to a different club. Currently, Gotze is going that way (signed a new dortmund contract and said he had no interest in us), and we've lost out on big bids in the past (albeit or players i wouldn't necessarily want at arsenal - samba, scott dann(?!) etc) And tottenham are a big club, I think with their ambition and reputation they can easily attract top names to help rebuild the squad. A team that should worry, though, is liverpool.

Finally, I concede about the tottenham team from the champions league qualification. I think i was speaking more retrospectively about this season in terms of the excellent performances being put in consistently up until about march (when you were 5 points off the top) and a number of top players have been retained who were also in that team like BAE, modric, more recently kaboul, bale, lennon, king etc and I personally am of the opinion some of those players you named were right to leave such as crouch, palacios, huddlestone, gomez.

true,keizersozei,flair5,,"Have you ever heard of the Auteur theory? (apologies if you already know) but its essentially the idea that the director of the film is the ""artist"" behind everything that you see, hear, and experience during that 90 minutes in the cinema. There are many, many problems with the theory, but I think football also developed in the same way (someone told me it started in the 70s-ish) that the manager of a football club is all-responsible for everything. I think this is why the manager takes the blame from the fans when the going gets tough (as you experienced earlier in the season). I think this idea can be applied to clubs like Arsenal, where Wenger is THE MAN and makes all decisions, signinigs, etc. - Although I still feel its a stupid things for stupid fans to do to a new manager, not Arsenen - who has turned you into the top 4 team that you consistently are. 

I don't feel Harry is the same at Spurs. Don't get me wrong, I love the guy for everything he has done for us. And he would have to murder a member of my family before I started booing him. But there was always the knowledge throughout the club, that Harry was using Spurs as a stepping stone. He has never, ever shyed away from the fact that he wants the England job, and we've all known this for at least the past 2 years. Just look at the ammount of cash we've spent on player in the past 2 windows by Levy: Friedel (free), Parker (¬£4m), Bayor (free), Saha (free) Nelson (free) - Levy knows of Harry's impending departure, and so will not spend big money on players that the new manager may not want (there is also the argument that we've saving for the new stadium, but hey).

I think your poor form at the start of the season was clearly down to the loss of your best 2 players (2 players who were some of the best in the country) and replacing them was always tough. The issue with us I think is that we may also face the same fate at the end of the season but we will also loose the most successful manager we've had in our Premier League lifetime, which is going to suck balls. Unless of course we qualify for the Champs, and we can convice Bale and Modric to chill for a while longer. If we fail to qualify, especially after a ludricrously successful season like this, the general consensis will be that we qualified once season, but are destined to be located somewhere in the UEFA cup. If Arsenal fail to qualify, people will think that you had a bad season, but you'll be right up there next season to fix the blip.

Again interesting is the point you make about the transfers, and i had in fact not looked at it that way.

Ok, moulding players to the Prem is fair. Newcastle have clearly done this shrewdly, and even the players who have only been there for a few months are worth so much more than they paid for. There's something about Pardew's personality that I don't like, but clearly he's doing an incredible job. 

Yeah your counter on 'snubbed' is also fairplay. We are OVERLY ambitious about signings so are snubbed daily. I almost think its a tactic of Levy's since Comolli's departure. ""Let's put out 100 bids for the best 100 players in the world and we'll take the ones that say yes.""

Lol When we've had shit days of football go our way, I talk to my friends who are Liverpool fans to cheers me up. But (I don't know if you are in the UK) I saw Jason Roberts asked by Collin Murray last week if he'd join the current Liverpool or the current Newcastle if given the chance, and his answer was Liverpool - because of the tradition and because they're probably just going through a blip atm. Not suggesting that he's all knowing, but this school of thought was insightful. Players would rather join the 'bigger' club rather than perhaps the more successful one......

I am currently working on an MA in Medieval History and have lived in the uni accommodation before.  My room was single with en-suite and I believe a lot of the graduate housing is like that.  Once you are a student, you can get access to a large list of private rentals with landlords that have been vetted by the uni and must keep certain standards.  Their rents tend to be much cheaper than those from larger letting agents.  Also, there is a ton of student housing outside the pricey areas of York.

I think student life depends on what you want.  There are clubs and bars, several on the main student bus routes, but as Chiiders points out, the nightlife isn't as big as other places.  However, the city is pretty safe and there are many, many pubs and places for a chat with friends or a quiet pint.  Most stores offer student discounts and there's also a lot of visually striking areas for film work (I know of a project that just finished up filming in one of the medieval churches). There are also many different societies for just about any interest and a large community of international students.  The city is easy to travel around without a car and there is a large train station with good connections to major cities (London is about 2.5 hours).

Tl;dr- Not in Film and TV but heard/seen good things. Uni and private accommodation not bad at all.  I've really enjoyed living in the city so far.

When I went online I nearly started crying because one person said they walked in and nearly turned around and went home it was so horrible.

The kitchen was nice too (when it wasn't filthy because my house mates were lazy). The problems were:

- The shower was grim and so was the toilet.

- You had to go outside to go to the kitchen (which means putting on SHOES urrrgghh effort)

- The wall were thin as FUCK and my neighbours insisted on making animal noises when banging.

- The doors slammed. Extremely loudly. 

Luckily all my friends were in Tyler, their rooms were good, but my place was cheap.

I personally thought this when he arrived at the club. He also developed a lot of the current England team at Westham: Ferdinands,A. Cole, Lampard etc. 

Thats fair advocacy. Although I've been under the impression that we've generally been quite whealthy. We've never been in much debt, and have had some profitable sales Berbatov ¬£31m, Keane ¬£20, Carrick ¬£18m etc Even before the big sales, we've splashed ¬£16m on Bent, Bentley or Modric when we've wanted to (back in the days when that was a lot of money for a player!). 

If I'm really honest, I think its got something to do with financing the club while we borrow the money to build a new stadium. Levy de-listed the Spurs shares recently because we had such a low valuation from the banks for the club. I remember Levy was quoted as saying that all the banks were estimating our player value as a combined ¬£50m which is what we would probably get for Modric or Bale alone.

I've often wondered if the doctors capsule has a special distinction via design. it was, after all, in a museum. susan is often credited with coining the acronym TARDIS so perhaps the doctor was influential in designing or enhancing tardis technology in some capacity. he is often superbly authoritative on the technology correcting other time lords with shortcuts or disagreements to standard procedure. 

maybe the tardis is THE tardis as in one that by design set a special standard or achievement in engineering... a special capsule in one way or another. 

then again, it could just be like we say ""I'll be in the car"" even if the vehicle isn't ours. *shrug*

People need to get a bit of fucking backbone, grow up, and stop hiding behind their 'staunch' feelings. There's nothing 'staunch' about it. It's weakness, pure and simple. This kind of close minded stupidity prevents cooperation, and ensures that we make decisions so slowly (assuming they are ever made) that we consistently fall behind the world.

I don't give a flying fuck if your Dad was Edward Carson, or Gerry Adams, or Eddie Izzard. I want you to vote for candidates that aren't trying to get elected based on being Republicans, or Unionists. I'd happily vote for a Protestant if I thought he had any good policies, or that his party was worth a damn. But I don't vote at all, because our politicians aren't worth a shit, and haven't changed a thing since they got all these devolved 'powers'.

The reality is, the powers weren't handed over, they were put in a place where they can never be used. If you ignore the feel good bullshit of the media, it's plain to see Stormont has done sweet fuck all since it opened.

As for 750,000 people in a huff, here's my thinking. If a United Ireland was declared now, I'd be in a huff. Why? Because the country would go to shit. There isn't the money for that. But if there was, then the only reason to be in a huff would be because of prejudice, and bigotry. And if 750,000 people want to get in a huff because of that, then they can stick it up their asses, because it's the will of the people, and democracy doesn't facilitate for disgruntled minorities. Just ask the nationalists.

There's a lot of people out there who don't want a united Ireland based on irrational sectarianism, bigotry and general ignorance, and I have no time for it. Right now there's a very good reason for not having a united Ireland. But when there isn't one, and I believe that one day there won't be any pragmatic reason for not having one, then anyone standing in the way of it will have to take their oil.

Nationalists will very soon outnumber Unionists. By the next census, actually. If the economic situation improves, the democratic process will make a united Ireland a certainty. If people want to go against democracy, they are taking a very dangerous road. One they cannot achieve victory through.

Yeah me too. We are somehow linked with everyone that the clubs above us are linked to. I don't know though, whether most of it is just the media, or if we are seriously courting those players. It does sound like Levy is pretty cutthroat with transfer dealings. There have been several occasions where Levy has pissed people off because of low (insulting) offers for certain players - sometimes even getting them in the end.

If you're from the UK or EU, it's ¬£4,620; but remember that since it's a postgraduate qualification, there are no student loans - you can get a grant, bursary or sponsor, or pay it yourself.

If you want to start the course in October 2012, you should apply soon - it's a popular course and they need time to review your application and for you to provide the supporting evidence.

As an overseas student you'll get priority for accomodation in on-campus halls, if you want it. The postgraduate college is [Wentworth](http://www.york.ac.uk/colleges/wentworth/) - one of the newer ones. However, rent in York is not that expensive (compared to similar cities and universities - though of course London is the most expensive). I'm paying ¬£75/week + bills living with 6 friends in a really nice house 10 minutes walk from the main campus.

The [Theatre, Film and Television department](http://www.york.ac.uk/tftv/) at York is the best in the country for facilities. The campus it's on is completely new (off to the side of the original uni campus) and the building itself opened almost two years ago at a cost of ¬£25 million.

Also, HMRC don't mind if it is old stuff of yours you are getting rid of, but if you are consistently purchasing stuff to sell on for a profit, it's a business and they'd expect you to declare this.

Also be aware that it is not up to you to decide if you are self-employed or not, it is up to HMRC. If you are doing work for only one business, person, group etc., then they may consider that you are in their employment and expect them, and yourself, to pay the appropriate tax owed.

Frankly, you don't even need to know that any more - you just need to know where to find returns calculators/strategy guides online, and how to read terms and conditions.

I feel like people think that what I've been saying in this thread is contemptuous. All I'll say is that nobody thinks that bookmakers are stupid for taking advantage of bettors who play the wrong odds. Why would anybody thing a bettor is stupid for taking advantage of a bookmaker doing the same? Unless everybody is absolutely set on the idea that casinos and bookmakers operate such a flawless system that they never make a mistake.

Ladbrokes, as shown in the OP's photo, were running a pair of weekly casino promotions for *months* (they finally realised their error a couple of weeks ago and yanked them) which had a combined expected return, with optimal play, of around ¬£275 per month, with absolutely minimal variance. The worst luck in the world would not be enough to stop you making a profit in that time - you would have to be cheated, and since they are a reputable company, you know that's not going to happen. To not take advantage of odds so heavily stacked in your favour would be absolutely preposterous. That would be akin to finding a thousand pounds down the back of your sofa and deciding you may as well just leave it there.

Still, despite the fact this sort of thing is common knowledge, and there are websites dedicated to helping people spot advantageous situations and showing them how to exploit them, people assume we're all idiots who are going to lose in the long run.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Oh I got this I got this! Important thing is that these people have no idea what the show is like, they're not emotionally invested in each of the characters or Doctors. You shouldn't go through each companion or era or series.

Don't tell them what's in the show, do tell them what the show is *like*.

Started in 1963, longest running sci-fi, many Guiness records, main character is a time travelling alien called the Doctor w/ a TARDIS (bigger on inside). Has adventures across space and time.

Key points:

 * The show ran from '63 to 89, rebooted in 2005 to now. EDIT: (could discuss circumstances of cancellation in '89)
 * The continuity is the same, and the format of the show is largely single episode stories
 * They've maintained the character by inventing the concept of regeneration, which yes, does cause people to argue about which portrayal is best. There have been 11 actors, we're on 11 (don't mention actors unless you want to name drop David Tennant).
 * Because of the reinvention of the show in nearly 50 years, it spans a very diverse range of genres, from Gothic horror to James Bond-Avengers, to school boy adventure novels, all the way up to drama and suspense.
 * The show has a HUGE cultural impact on its origin country, Britain, resulting in a phenomenon called Dalekmania.
 * The Daleks are the iconic archenemies of the Doctor, based off Nazis, been around since 1963. (Do not describe their motives/goals/appearance, too much detail or I don't know..trust me it doesn't go over well. I've tried.) OR WAIT, maybe you might want to leave them out all together..the name Dalek would have no significance to them...
 * It's different from other forms of sci-fi because it's not about the science fiction or explanations so sometimes the science is realistic other times it borders or even IS fantasy.
 * It's different from other forms of sci-fi because it pays a great deal of attention to its characters as well as sci-fi action plots. The series makes lots of people bawl their eyes out.
 * The universe/franchise is so huge that it's spawned 3 movies, 3 spinoff shows, over 5 novel ranges, hundreds of books, radio dramas, comics, and we're approaching *season* 33.

After all this wonderful info, you might want to end with a personal touch. i.e. My favorite incarnation is so and so for his love of life/deep darkness inside/adventure/etc. And the show became my favorite because la-dee-da.

I know all this is pretty specific. There's just a fine line to balance between telling them too much (the premise is pretty weird) and overwhelming them, versus giving them the *tone* of the premise.

Depending on time constraints, you could show them a quick series trailer, or a music video (I've got some great recommendations). Do you get visual aids?

EDIT: 

 * The general theme of the show is about celebration of humanity, friendship, and how intelligence and romanticism triumphs over brute force and cynicism.
 * The Doctor represents many of humanity's great traits, but he travels with companions for friendship and for people to call him on his crap when he gets out of hand.

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"It was only good in the sense that we were able to rest a number of key players. The back four worked well together, so good on Bertrand and Bos for that. Terry/Cahill, another solid game overall, should keep their confidence levels up for Barca. Essien and Romeu were also pretty good, I thought they could have done a bit more to disrupt Arsenal's possession, but as both have been out of the side for a long time, overall they were good.

The attack was dreadful though. We gave precious minutes to some fringe players (Torres aside) in a big match - they needed to do a lot better. Kalou, Malouda and Sturridge all looked like they wanted to play for themselves, which meant Torres, who relies heavily on the players around him, was going to have a quiet game. Those three were also disappointing themselves, so in the end, our attack was quite lame. I don't like to see this - our fringe players need to take these opportunities and really shine, they shouldn't be this unenthusiastic and lackadaisical. 

If these are the performances we can expect from them, especially against high competition like Arsenal, we should ship them out (Sturridge/Torres excluded). We need younger players who have more to prove, who can help fight this complacency against games that have lesser meaning. I think if more of our subs had this attitude we would have had much better results this year.

true,Morvis42,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"YES!! Thank You! I've been thinking that this whole time. I would understand it if it was a Ganger Doctor since the flesh is a full copy of the person it's imitating right down to the cellular level. The flesh would be a Timelord if it copies a Timelord. But the Teselcta is a giant vehicle that is run by little people in side of this very precise machine. It can mimic the appearance of another person but it doesn't fully become that other person. It is still essentially a giant ship when it is copying the Doctor. It has not turned into a Timelord, it has just camouflaged itself as one. 

However by that argument you could therefore claim that the regeneration is just a very elaborate extension of the Teselecta's camouflaging capabilities and there was nothing actually regenerating. There was just a very advanced machine perfectly imitating the appearance of a regeneration. They did have detailed files on The Doctor, River, Amy and Rory. I'm sure they have some file somewhere that shows them what a regeneration looks like.

When he's out there with Kalou/Malouda/Sturridge, everyone knows they're going to be selfish and not really play for Torres or even the team really.

If i were you, i would not do the video, it eats too much time and you can get graded down if you go over time. So my advise, stick to 4 paragraphs: 1-overall explanation of the show. Ex. Doctor who is a british scifi show that has been around maybe twice as long as You! (Attention getter?) The doctor can regenerate, same character different actor (restate this a couple of times or they might not get that it's the same person)(if you do show a clip, show the regeneration, its only seconds long and will effectivly get your point accross), saves the world, blah blah. 2nd- eccelson, show comes out of a hiatus with a war torn doctor. He is angry and sad, but still adventurus. He meets a girl, and together they fight monsters and witness the end of the earth. blah blah, 3-Tennant But eccelson takes in the energy of the tardis to save rose (BTW bring pic's of all characters mentioned, or your audience will get lost) and he transforms into ...da da da daaaa! David Tennant!! widely know for being the best doctor the show has ever had. ... his story ends with a sad goodbye blah blah blah. Now we have Matt Smith (4th) newest companion who has yet to be seen on screen....blah blah In conclusion today i have told you about the most recent ""Doctor who"" Doctors but there are many more, and i hope you will check out the show for yourself. who knows we might see a post later after your speech asking which episode to start at...

true,mszegedy,tennant,Tennant,"I want to do this because it'll be fun, but *gosh* it'll be complicated. I have relatively very little freedom in this, because there are GLOSSARIES that exist. D: I thought these might be useful whence to derive a phonology, but my problem is this:

What I need to do first is compose a language (or, as I like to jokingly refer to it, ""comcose a lanbuage"", because I like to fuck with retrogessional nasal placement allophony in English) for Old High Vulcan, whence to derive Vulcan and Romulan (did I mention? I'm doing all three). This won't be too hard; all that will have to be similar are the phonologies, accounting for vowel shifts and all those sorts of nifty things. But I can't jump straight to Vulcan and Romulan from there.

First, for Vulcan, I must compose a language that is a direct result of Surak's reforms; that is, what happened RIGHT AFTER he enacted the Reform that made the language whole and pure. Then, *thence* will I derive the ""current"" version of Vulcan, by tracing an imagined evolutionary path that results in our now-aged and well-documented Vulcan.

Romulan will be less simple and more tedious. It's essentially the descendant of Old High Vulcan without the reforms, right? So, a simple solution would be to develop that language much further until it becomes Romulan, whatever that might be. However, not being very good at constructing languages, I can only do this in ~400 year increments. And it has been a bit over 2000 years since the language was in the state of being Old High Vulcan! So, the logical solution is to create four intermediaries, and have the fifth language be the true result. But the language was kept at least *somewhat* stable by contact with the Vulcans. I doubt it was very much more stable, though, since the languages they spoke were objectively and immutably dissimilar. But I think it's enough to knock off a single intermediary. And then we'd have our three Vulcan languages, and a linguistic history as well!

However, this is all shot, because THERE IS A ROMULAN GLOSSARY AS WELL. Oh snap! Didn't think of that, didja? Why create realistic linguistic divergence, WHEN THE AUTHORS HAVE ALREADY GIVEN YOU WHAT THEY IMAGINED UP? It's completely perfect in every way. For example, we are given the phrase ""manil arek"" in Vulcan. It means ""swift death""! So, of course, the logical conclusion for its Romulan equivalent, following *two thousand years* of obstellar segregation, is obviously ""ma'l arik"". There is no way they could have changed any more than that, especially after two milennia! Because either there is something extremely pertinent and variable that lays cloaked in this limiting orthography, or *they're nearly exactly the same damn thing*. One or the other! And check out this gem from the Romulan glossary (which would be impossible to tell apart from the Vulcan glossary were it not for its ever-gratuitious use of diphthongs): guess what the translation for ""Star Road of the People"" is, courtesy of a manual for an I'm sure very excellent game: ""'Latasam Stelai Rom'lnz"". It would be very unnecessary for me to speak more on the matter.

(By the way, breaking character for a moment: for the former parallel, it actually makes sense somewhat for it to be that way: [an] does indeed have a tendency to become nasal [√£], something that would in all likelihood not be shown in an English transliteration for those idiot Humen, and totally what I would put in my language as well were it to crop up. However, that would be across a *single* iteration. Maybe two. Nasals are short-lived, and ugly. By no means would this last. I'm not sure what it would change into, but the rest of the consonants definitely wouldn't stay that way. \*le sign* I'll have to employ much creative artistic licence for this to work.)",0,1335082283,null,0,false,0,c4f68pn,t3_sfh0j,t1_c4f68pn,t1_c4f0wae,null,1428771691,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

You'll get a visit from someone, but you're under no obligation to even speak to them.

Having recently lived in a student house where there were several red TV licensing letters on the mat before the first of our house-mates had even moved in. We did a bit of reading up on the matter and found that after 2 or 3 visits of not being allowed in, they are able to get a police officer and a warrant to check if you have a tv. (never gonna happpen, far too expensive) But then theres a loop hole. If that event ever does occur, where they demand entry, unplug your tv and boxes from the mains and sever the tv's power cord, chopping off the plug, before you let them in, because the tv has to be able to receive signal to count as licensable so no power cord = no license needed.

To watch any sort of television programmes from any broadcaster (e.g. ITV, BBC, Dave, whatever channel it may be) you need a licence. That's if you're watching the programmes live as they're being broadcasted, whether it be through freeview or iPlayer.

If you want to watch Top Gear that was on last Sunday through iPlayer, or Come Dine With Me that was on last night but you missed it so you use 4oD, since you're not watching it live as they're broadcasting it, then that doesn't need a licence.

You don't need the licence to own a TV, just to be able to receive broadcasts legally. You can use it to play DVDs, tapes, play games, whatever, but if you want to watch programmes (as they're being broadcasted) you'll need a licence for it.

If you're a student and away from home in the halls, and your family home where you would otherwise reside has a tv licence, if you have a laptop or similar device which runs off of its battery, then you'd be fine to use that to watch live broadcasts.

Edit: [Source for the last point which has also been revised](http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/for-your-home/students-aud1/?WT.mc_id=r107#mainhome).

Also I'm actually surprised how little some people know about the licence fee xD

More to answer your questions, I suppose technically watching live streams of channels if it's as they're being broadcasted on any site, whether it be YouTube or others, a licence would still be required. If what Al Jazeera are streaming via YouTube is what is on TV as well, then in that case a licence would be needed.

I'm not too certain legally about the international ones but I honestly doubt a licence would be needed for it, 90% sure on that.",0,1335086904,null,0,true,0,c4f6lm4,t3_slts9,t1_c4f6lm4,t3_slts9,null,1428771859,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

* **TV Licence**. If you know neither yourself or your girlfriend are going to want to watch ""live"" broadcasts, then you can skip this. I know it's been expanded upon in detail by others but the short version: You need a licence for watching live content - not having equipment that's capable of doing so. A quick email to TVL, done properly, will prevent them from hassling you for years.
* **Gas &amp; Electricity**: You might have these on a ""Pay as you use"" meter. If you can manage your finances have them removed as soon as possible, as they're a lot more expensive than paying via Direct Debit.
* **Water Rates**: Check with your provider - you *might* be better off having a water meter fitted, if there isn't one already in the property. It it starts to work out more expensive, you can typically have it removed, and revert back to a standard bill.

As for other the rest? Read your meters as soon as you move in, contact the existing utility providers, and supply the readings.

Photograph any weird ""stains"" on the walls, carpets - anything that could be construed as potential damage, in order to prove you haven't done it.

Food storage - if you're thinking about getting a freezer, personally I'd recommend a ""chest cabinet"" as opposed to one with individual draws. They're much easier to store food in, particularly if you make your own meals.

This is usually a direct debit plan. See if you can't get some nice introductory offers. If you aren't offered them, just say that you're sure that *other company* is offering a more attractive offer. Ask them if there is a deal for having your gas and electricity with the same company (I'm on some ridiculously-named dual-fuel-awesome-family-and-young-professional-student thing that means I pay n-power ¬£123 per month for both gas and leccy for a draughty 3 bed house with wasteful students in it.).

**EDIT:** Really insist that the companies give you their 'best offer' and 'cheapest rate possible' - they absolutely cannot lie to you but you will often find weird charges - npower charged me for a paper bill once! Just keep moaning until you get a decent service and if they don't cooperate or you find that you didn't get the cheapest rate, report em to ofgem.

Direct debit can shave off about ¬£50 or so. It's also easier to budget. Just make sure you regularly call them up and ask for a bill otherwise they estimate. Usually quite generously.

Get an internet and phone package from O2 if you have a mobile with O2 in the household. It's all on their website about the deals you can get. If not, say you're going to go to O2 and Orange give you ¬£60 of Sainsbury's vouchers.

Council Tax - look on your council's website for where to send the cheque. Don't forget to register on the electoral register again.

TV license - if you don't want or need one, don't get one.

* Britain is much freer than Australia - there is not that 'penal colony' attitude .

* Britain is a more mature society than Australian society .

* Britain is beautiful . Suffolk is a beautiful area .

* the economy is definitely picking up in Britain .

* you can get a lot of good experience here in Britain .

Cons :-

* the job market is much better in Australia than the UK .

* getting a job with experience is much easier than not having any experience . Mobility is important .

* Britain is very spread out - you would need to think out carefully your transport options \ buy a car .

Wages are much the same as in Australia . Taxes probably a bit higher . Costs are a combination of cheaper and more expensive than Australia . Most things are cheaper but petrol is way more expensive .

Now whatever this greater force is (Some deity, Flying Spaghetti Monster, The Universe, Time itself, whatever), if it can determine a fixed point that must happen, it would surely know that the Doctor isn't actually dead. So I would think that this greater force could bring down consequences for a fixed point not actually occurring.

It's not just about money.  it's also about values and culture, in addition to inherent human biases.

The reason casinos and bookies stay in business is because the kinds of people who gamble are most likely to crave the emotional stimulation from gambling itself, rather than just the possibility of financial reward.  For these people, the *thrill* of gambling is a very real high, so much so that any logic and reason goes out the window.

For every rational gambler, you'll have 10 who *feel* they are riding a lucky streak, or who are so emotionally invested that they cannot stop even if they know they're ahead.

*this* is why I call it an idiot tax.  Because human nature is such that if you're so involved in gambling that you are able to play an advantage against the house, then you're also probably so involved that you cannot stop.  And only a select few have the ability to know when to quit when ahead.  That is why you see all these poor fools clawing at the doors to get in at the first opportunity: because they're hooked.

In terms of *cultural values*, it's pretty damning when a large percentage of the high street real estate is taken up by a form of predatory speculation.

I mention this because popping over to France suggests something easy and impulsive - it is possible to get cheaper tickets if you plan 6 weeks in advance.

Eurostar to Paris: ¬£100 return (best you can get is apparently ¬£69 but that depends on time of day. Tends to be around the ¬£100 mark in my experience).

Total travel time about 6 hours each way if you get it right.

Pay a minimum of ¬£165 (might get lucky with cheap flights, although that's much slower when you allow for airline security bullshit) for travel.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;There was a big difference in availability of hardcore porn

You've repeated this over and over and I've already acknowledged that it was harder to get ahold of each time. Got any new arguments?

Oh and BTW, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgxEh-F_Cf8) is a propaganda film *from 1965* about how kids are accessing hardcore pornographic materials and it shows quite a few interesting examples of said materials. Again, it was all there, and people like you were still calling it a problem; it was just a bit harder to obtain.

&gt;Well done you for 'fucking' coding HTML when you were 10. I was programming my spectrum 'properly' when i was 7 but i still couldn't get around my vodafone 3g filter when i tried (i believe it is possible). Besides, the current filters are very cheap and cheerful, they don't need to be.

But... All you need to do for the mobile filters is use Opera Mini... It isn't hard...

Current filters and new filters will always be bypassable. The Great Firewall of China can be bypassed, some porn filter crap doesn't stand a chance.

&gt;What it is meant to achieve (not quite sure why this isn't patently obvious from what i've written), is a material reduction in the access to hardcore porn for children young enough to adversely affected by it. This sort of thing already exists - e.g. netnanny - this would be an easier solution for them to a the problem. i was pointing out that it IS a real concern for parents, it IS a practical problem that they want solving and an ISP filter WAS a solution that they would welcome - albeit with the caveats that it's opt-in, easy to remove, and not part of any legislation. Will it stop everything? Probably not. Do age limits on cigarettes stop all underage smokers? No - but it doesn't mean you throw out all the regulations.

But even if these filters actually worked perfectly, they'd still find other ways to access it. They'd pass around DVDs at school, get friends to copy stuff into USB keys, whatever. You can't filter the sneakernet.

And I'd argue that porn isn't so bad anyway, certainly not enough to be ""adversely affected"" by. If it was really that bad I'd be really fucked up by now considering the amount of porn I watched when I was younger ;)

&gt;Try to see the world from a different perspective from that of a 19 year old boy. To be brutally condescending - you will feel different about it when you are responsible for young children with access to computers.

Not really, because I know that my own experiences online at a young age taught me a lot. I learnt from my own mistakes and from doing lots of stupid shit. I'm now quite internet savvy as a result. That wouldn't have come from a filter (in the real world, the filter would have just taught me how to get past a filter, so it might work for that reason I guess :P).

true,Prawns3,num26,,"I'm probably a bit contraversial on this one but here goes. Get rid of Modric, beginning to think we should of sold him last season, we're probably going to get a smaller fee than we would now but it should still be substantial. Try to keep Bale, if not we can get a nice fee for him too. Using this money we can really, and I mean really, bolster our squad. I'm talking new striker(s), a solid young CB to pair with Kaboul and Caulker, solid cover for Lennon and Walker, and a brand spankin new left winger. Livermore when he plays well can be a complete beast in the midfield, a real passing moster. He's been playing more of a physical, defensive role as of late, but I think we could almost play a Modric-like position given some time. 

As for the manager, I don't want to keep Harry. No tactics and lack of direction in set peices won't cut it anymore. I, personally, would love to see AVB come in. Chelsea had no faith in him, and I think given time for the team to adapt, and to bring players in that suit his style he'd do great things for the club. I also wouldn't mind if we got Mourinuo and he splashed the Bale/Modric cash on some amazing new spine for the team. Eitherway I hope King can play next season and get a few spectacular games in, score a few goals and move on to a training/assistant manager role of some sort at the club.

true,Tactful,uk,Bristol,"The UK is a lot more dense than Aus, in a way you probably wont be able to comprehend. I couldn't comprehend the vastness of Aus before I visited.

In Australia, 99% of the population live on 1% of the land: the coast. In the UK, cities are so dense you're never more than maybe an hour's drive away from civilization.

Culturally, we lack the aboriginal aspect of your culture, and the casual racism that sometimes accompanies it. We're a fairly multicultural country, with people of varying races. This varies depending on where you live: The national average percentage of black people is 2%, but in Bristol where I live I think it's about 4.

Weather wise, you're gonna be bummed out. Due to our country's placement, an avergae of 51 percent of days are overcast. That means there's a chance it might rain on half of the days in the year. I believe this gives us a sort of cynical disposition that's insidious in our society.

Language barrier shouldn't be too difficult. 

The main difference is the size. In Aus, all the streets are massive and you have huge pavements. This is because your cities were designed long after engineering and city-planning norms had been established, thus you have templates to build on. Our cities built-up slowly over potentially thousands of years, from small villages to thriving hubs.

London is an excellent example of this: The streets are narrow and sprawling, buildings crammed into a small area. Other cities follow suit, but London is the best example.

Other than that, I think most people have covered the other stuff. There's a difference in humour, but that's not too important. Money is obviouslly valued differently.

true,SpasticPanda,flair2,,"I had a chat about this with my mate when we hung out this afternoon and we both came to the same conclusion. 
I don't know that much about VdV, but from what I can see, he is very happy at the club. Yes he wants to go play in the Eridivisie again, but I don't see that happening right now. 
Walker is going to keep developing. He is probably the hardest worker on the team right now. Despite all of his positives, he still has defensive weaknesses, it isn't worth leaving for him until he irons those wrinkles out, if he wants to leave at all. 
Bale - has been so frustrating of late. His form is like a pulse monitor, it goes up and down and up and down. I don't like his Ronaldo approach, and his need to take over games. *But* he is critical for our team, and when playing like he means it, is nigh unstoppable. Eventually, he will want to earn more than 85k a week, or whatever the wage cap it. But its not now. He gets lots of minutes, and control over his position at Spurs. This level of control will not be afforded to him at the Catalan giants, nor a similar sized club. I don't think we will have to try to keep him, a wage bump in recognition of his skill set may be required.
Modric - I think it is time for Modric to move on. He has seemed completely disinterested in the games lately, and his form has critically fallen. 

May I puncture this statement with this: Redknapp has been the cause of a lot of these problems. Before the haters hit me up, I have great respect and love for the man, but the QPR game laid it bare for all to see. Under a press, the Spurs were forced to go central and couldn't move the ball forward. Too many times we gave up possession because of poor position. Too many times did we attempt Hollywood, cross field passes. Most teams have now just figured out that if they force the ball in to the middle of the pitch, all of a sudden the team only passes sideways and backward. When Modric is forced to play a forward midfield role, his effectiveness is halved. 

I honestly still think that Champions League is a very real possibility. The head dropping has started far too early, and to be quite frank, I am sick to fucking death of the 'Fuck' threads in this subreddit. The track ain't over til it fucking stops, and until I can't hear a beat, I will continue to watch the matches, and continue to stand tall. 
&gt;It is better to fail aiming high than to succeed aiming low. And we of Spurs have set our sights very high... so high, in fact, that even failure will have in it an echo of glory.

This is a team of great talent and spirit, and we as fans should reflect both that spirit and appreciate that talent with great humility.

* you're only 22 with no kids.  Now's the time to run around and live in different places and have fun.  It'll only get harder to do as you get older and accumulate more responsibilities.  

* If you end up hating it, you can always move back to melbourne and still say you used to live in another country.  Nothing has to be set in stone.

* As an Aussie it shouldn't be too hard to get a working visa 

* There are jobs, but it helps to be flexible and not picky to begin with.  As you have admin experience, you could start at a temp agency.  Once they know you a bit and find you to be reliable, then you can start to network and hopefully lead to a more permanent position (that what I did when I first moved here 7 yrs ago).  Also, you could do the same thing at a gym to get experience and meet people.  Not sure if personal training credentials will transfer, but it could easily be something you do on the side.

* The grass is always greener.  Yes you live in a city that many would want to immigrate to from the UK, but you've lived there already and want to live somewhere new and different.

* Ultimately, the two countries aren't that different.  Once you settle down, you've have the same routine of working, commuting, eating, sleeping, socialising.  There will just be some small differences and different weather, but nothing that will destroy your universe.  Life is still life, no matter where you live it.

* Generally speaking, every place will have twats and nice people and chavs and theives and saints.  Wherever you live, you choose your friends and your own community of people and that determines the type of experience you'll have (IMO).

* Their finishing was godawful. Tello was just so poor. Not Barca quality. He had one shot where it was just him and Iker in a good position and he skied it. It went completely vertical. They clearly are very reliant on Villa.
* They made many, many mistakes. Looked uncharacteristically sloppy, similar to the first leg with Chelsea but a lot worse. This may have been due to Madrid's better pressing tactics but Barca looked very shaky in the midfield. 
* Barca barely ever had more than 2 players in the opposition box. Madrid were able to open up the game and play some actual football and stop Barca containing them in their own box and pick them apart. Again, Madrid are better at passing football but they made it clear that you don't have to resort to long balls and counters to beat Barca; their current team (in the form that they're in) just doesn't dominate the way it used to.

Prime example: in RTD's run you see Nine and Ten going up to strangers, being amiable and generally just being friendly. You see them have chats with others and laugh with friends. You get a sense that they're people who can actually make friends.

By contrast in Closing Time and The Lodger the Eleventh Doctor just *has* friends. He makes them offscreen and they just find his every action to be quirky and lovable.

It's an informed ability, and Moffat relies on that a lot, feeling the need to *tell* you instead of *showing* you. He has this need to add titles like ""the Girl Who Waited"" and ""the Last Centurion"" and have other characters expound about how Amy's the most important person in the world or how River is super intimidating, but he rarely takes the time to let you sort all that out for yourself.

Similarly, he has this propensity to needlessly work in complexities. Complexities that, once examined, make very little sense.

I think his stance on time travel is a key example of this. Prior to him coming on Doctor Who's stance on time travel was ""don't think about it"". The TARDIS took you to the future like it took you to a location. The actual nature of time travel was just kind of ignored because rarely to writers handle the difficult concept in a consistent manner.

What it *is*, is an article that sits perfectly with the usual anti-immigration rhetoric the Daily Mail espouses on a daily basis, and which their readership laps up, to serve their own prejudices.

Just look at the opening paragraph:

&gt;A group of Muslim men who abducted and raped two teenage girls as part of their Eid celebrations laughed in court yesterday as they were jailed for a total of 38 years.

If you follow the ""logic"" as written in that paragraph, it seems to suggest that the men were doing this as part of the celebrations - in the same way that Christians celebrate the stations of the cross.

Which is a load of bollocks, frankly. Those men aren't representative of the 1billion muslims on the planet, nor are the representative of the how ever many muslims live in the UK. Nor are there actions in any way representative / indicative of the teachings of Islam.

Occasionally she sells them to friends and work colleagues for an amount that just covers the cost of materials of ¬£15. Sometimes she makes a loss. Any money she does make goes towards her holiday fund.

&gt;She decides to make extra cash by selling cushions on an Internet auction site and starts auctioning three or four to see how they go. They all sell for more than ¬£50, a profit of at least ¬£35 each.

&gt;She uses this money to buy more materials and within a month she is selling around ten cushions a week, always at a profit, and is considering setting up her own website.

&gt;**Gail‚Äôs initial sales of cushions to friends are not classed as trading. It lacks commerciality and she does not set out to make a profit. The occasional sales are a by-product of her hobby. Once she begins to auction her cushions, she has moved into the realms of commerciality.**

He dislike the moral hazard of giving free money to banksters, tried to persuade the chancellor to take a longer view than this weeks popularity figures and in the end did what the politicians wanted.

The author of this article is a typical socialist who wants to give other peoples money to scumbags. He is just castigating King because he has different political views.

The banking crisis was because the labour government failed to regulate the banks properly. As the article says, King was in charge of monetary policy, not fiscal policy, he didn't have the power to stop the high street banks taking terrible risks with other people's money.

true,aspartame_junky,null,null,"it has been [well-demonstrated](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=where-theres-a-will) that those capable of self-control as children are most likely to succeed as adults.

Whereas there is a genetic component (risk-aversion vs risk-seeking), much of it has to do with early learning of discipline, particularly the delaying of gratification.

As per the linked article (above):

*""The real surprise, however, came a decade later, when Prof Mischel and his colleagues tracked down the children to see what kind of people they were turning into. They found that the children who had been best at delaying gratification had better academic and social skills. They typically achieved much higher Scholastic Aptitude Test scores, were less likely to be distracted, more motivated to succeed and were better at making and keeping friends.""*

People with the ability to delay gratification do not invest in speculative endeavors, both from a disciplinary point of view, but also from a cultural perspective, as such endeavors are taught by conscientious parents to be fools' errands.  This is why your idea would not work: because those with the capacity for self-control would not be willing to gamble in the first place, no matter how much ""advantage"" you would offer.

Thus, due to a selection effect, those who *do* gamble are also those most susceptible to desiring immediate gratification, thus creating a vicious cycle that only benefits the house, not the participants.

Unfortunately, this predilection for immediate gratification over delayed gratification tends to be robust over a person's life, such that one has self-control never becomes engrossed in speculative endeavors such as gambling, whereas those who cannot delay gratification often neglect long-term benefits (such as education, saving money, etc) for short-term gains, and thus often seek avenues for short-term gains such as gambling as preferred to alternative but ultimately more sustainable forms of income.

if you're looking for a silver bullet, there isn't one.  Education, primarily of the young for self-control and the ability to delay gratification for long-term rewards, seems to be the best bet.

If you lower a nurse or teacher's wage you end up struggling to attract decent staff in out of the way / impoverished areas. Why work in a shit hole for less money than you can earn in a decent area?  Result : more intergenerational poverty in both education and health.

If you offer a senior manager or surgeon a 5-10% cut to work in a poor area, will they opt to work there if they can find a job in a better paid area?  Remember, surgeons don't lie awake at night worrying about the mortgage, they worry about how often they can upgrade the car, or which private school to send the kids to.  A 5% cut impacts their disposal income.

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"Here is the article you are referring to:

Over the years I have argued that football is a stupid game in which 22 overpaid nancy boys with idiotic hair run around a field attempting to kick an inflated sheep‚Äôs pancreas into some netting while an audience of several thousand van drivers beat one another over the head with bottles and chairs.

 Nor could I understand how someone from Tooting could possibly support, say, Manchester United, a team sponsored by those hateful bastards at AIG and made up of players from Portugal, France, Holland and, in the case of Wayne Rooney, Walt Disney. Where‚Äôs the connection? What‚Äôs the point?

 I have also suggested that it‚Äôs preposterous to have football stadiums in the middle of cities. Why should anyone be delayed by match traffic just so a handful of thugs can watch a Brazilian man falling over?

 And as for those people who can‚Äôt cope if their team loses. Give me strength. If you get all teary-eyed just because someone from Latvia, playing in a town you‚Äôve never been to, for an Arab you‚Äôve never met, against some Italians you hate for no reason, has missed a penalty, how are you going to manage when you are diagnosed with cancer?

 I have always hated football, but then one day, out of the blue, my son announced that he had become interested in Chelsea. This was a living nightmare. If he‚Äôd said that he‚Äôd become interested in smoking, I could have made all sorts of threats. If he‚Äôd said he‚Äôd become interested in homosexuality, we could have talked. But a football team? I had no answers. I didn‚Äôt even have any questions.

 However, because he spent so much time watching football on television, I started pausing to watch. And I began to think that actually it‚Äôs a very beautiful game when it‚Äôs played properly. And that the offside rule, really, is no more complicated than the average power station. And then I started picking up bits of information from the commentators, which meant, for the first time ever, that when conversation with friends turned to football, I could join in, instead of sticking my fingers in my ears and singing sea shanties.

 This meant that pretty soon people started asking if perhaps I‚Äôd like to go to a game. And that‚Äôs why last weekend I was at Stamford Bridge watching Chelsea demolish a team I used to call Manchester City. But that I now know is called Useless Money-Wasting Scum.

 This was my first Premier League game and, ooh, it was good. When you‚Äôre there, rather than watching on television, you get an overall view, which means you can see how the game works. You notice that Frank Lampard is like a blackbird, always looking around to see where the hawks are. You see that Carvalho runs with his arms up, like a begging puppy, and you work out that Michael Essien always seems to be able to find a piece of the pitch that the Useless Scum either hadn‚Äôt noticed or were frightened of.

 The other advantage of being there is that on television the microphones are positioned so you can‚Äôt hear the chants. I‚Äôd heard, of course, about this mass spontaneity over the years, usually when a team is playing Liverpool. ‚ÄúSign on. Sign on. With a pen in your hand. Cos you‚Äôll ne . . . ver get a job.‚Äù Or: ‚ÄúThe wheels on your house go round and round. Round and round. Round and round.‚Äù

 There are others too. Plymouth Argyll refer to any team they play as northern bastards. Then you have the Charlton fans who travelled down the M4 to Reading recently and, having failed to think of any suitable abuse, came up with: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it like to live in Wales?‚Äù

 The Chelsea fans topped all this last Sunday with a nonstop song, the lyrics of which were: ‚ÄúF*** off, Robinho. F*** off, Robinho. F*** off, Robinho.‚Äù I joined in wholeheartedly, even though I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure who Mr Robinho was and why I wanted him to eff off so much.

 No matter. It was all so brilliantly working class. Or it would have been, had I not been seated in a private box just outside the no-jeans-allowed Armani Lounge, where I‚Äôd feasted on smoked salmon and quaffed bucks fizz before kickoff.

 But I got a reminder of footballing‚Äôs outside-khazi and jumpers-for-goalposts roots when Chelsea scored. I turned and smiled a patronising smile at the man sitting behind me, the former Independent editor and all-round crap driver Simon Kelner. It turned out he was a big fan of the Scum and, honestly, I thought he was going to kick my head off.

 I wouldn‚Äôt have blamed him. I used to be surprised that football fans fought one another. Now, though, having experienced the white heat of pride and tribalism first hand, I‚Äôm surprised they don‚Äôt any more.

 After the game I was taken to the Chelsea dressing room so that I could admire all the players‚Äô penises ‚Äì many were very enormous indeed. I talked to Roman Abramovich, who was charming, and Lampard, who, having just run around for 90 minutes, still found the energy to get the entire team to sign my boy‚Äôs Chelsea shirt. I don‚Äôt do that for kids who come to the Top Gear studio and I‚Äôm supposed to be the public-school-educated toff.

 So there we are, then. I am now a football fan. I know this because in one afternoon I learnt I‚Äôm not a football fan at all. I‚Äôm a fan of Chelsea. Chelsea are the only team that can play. Chelsea players have by far the most impressive reproductive organs. Stamford Bridge is my church. The men who play there are my Gods.

 In short, I have a team, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs always been missing. Because I was born in Doncaster.

Figure out the important points about the doctor like : 

* He is an alien
* His race are called the timelords
* They have 2 hearts but look human
* They can regenerate 

I usually present things with something being projected on a screen, I work to ~1 minute per slide unless there is something particularly complicated that needs to be explained.

I put all the important points that I want the audience to know on the slide and it's a prompt for me to remember the important points, then I can fill in the information around them. 

One other useful tip to remember is that even if you practice it perfectly to 6 minutes, on the day a little adrenalin may kick in and you'll speak a bit faster. 

Good luck!

* Manchester or Liverpool. Choose a side. This is a matter of life and death.

* You must never actively voice your disapproval of something or someone via the spoken word. Instead, this is done through the medium of '*tutting*'.

* Saturday Night TV is sacred.

* You **must** understand how to make a cup of tea properly. You must follow the procedure of brewing-up *to the letter*.

* The Royal family, you must love them or hate them. There is no middle ground. But as an Aussie, you may already have some idea of which side of the fence you reside in.

&gt; public transport work well overall (at least near London where I am),

You obviously haven't used Cornish public transport. :) It's dire, and expensive. I'm Cornish born and bred, and unless you live in a town (and many don't like me) you need to learn to drive to get anywhere unless you want to deal with irregular and expensive bus services. Trains are better but you need to get to the train station somehow.

London truly has it good when it comes to public transport, but then it's no surprise that the entire system is run by an arm of local government (although private companies sometimes provide the service) that basically does what it wants.

It wouldn't surprise me if what I have said can be said for the entire country - public transport is okay in urban areas but it quickly deteriorates as you get out of the towns and cities.

I've been privatised from central government to a private firm. The people who drew up the contract and the firm that bid for it honestly had no idea of the work that we did in our office. Entire parts of the service that we used to deliver to the rest of our department weren't accounted for. It took our new employer more than a year, but they eventually stopped us doing all the things we weren't actually being paid to do and focused us all on the actual contract. In the meantime, our customer lost functionality in their business that maybe the senior managers didn't care about, but I know the clerical staff found our old services very useful.

That's my experience, but most public sector outsourcing contracts have got stories like that. Public sector contracting is a shambles. The functions that are getting privatised are core competencies. If you ran a business would you give the core of your business to someone else on a contractual basis?

My personal view is that they're doing this because they want to get rid of it all. The government isn't outsourcing public services, they're outsourcing their industrial disputes.

Furthermore, I think the fact that Supernatural has utilized time travel and alternative universes on quite a few occasions, that both shows feature an iconic mode of transportation (the impala; the TARDIS), and that both feature heroes prevailing over creatures/aliens/other things that threaten humanity with a mix of fun and angst, has all given SuperWho a lot to work with.

Don't insult people; I think some of the answers here might have given you the impression that that's a good thing to do. Just be nice and you'll be fine. Some people might take the piss out of you; you should be able to tell if they're joking around or being arseholes.

Apparently in the US people talk to random strangers quite a lot (like someone else said in the tube or wherever). It sounds like a nice aspect of your culture but we don't really do it here.

Also people will be able to tell you're an American, and so they'll take this into account before judging the way you act. So really don't worry. Many people will be very interested in the fact that you're American. Don't show off about being an American, but don't be shy about it.

It depends which type of circumcision you're talking about. There are many different types, both male and female. Some female circumcision is 'worse' than some male, while some male circumcision is 'worse' than female. It could even be argued that because more males are circumcised, men as a whole suffer worse than women. I'm not making that claim, just pointing out that there are numerous different ways of looking at the problem.
 
[This short video (SFW)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98f3IavuEgQ) demonstrates how it isn't really 'fair' to say that one is worse than the other. As dwdwdw2 put it: ""Carving babies is wrong"".

Infibulation - the type of FGM most people know of and assume all female circumcision is - is terrible and no reasonable person can deny that, but there's something wrong with the world when we divide along the lines of gender when it comes to cutting the genitals of infants. 

A pin prick on a infant girl's labia is illegal. Removal of the most sensitive skin on a infant boy's penis, leaving possible further function inhibiting scar tissue and damage, is entirely legal.

&gt;Liverpool try to play possession football, and I feel like most of their numerous possessions, especially against poorer sides, are of the buildup type, and too many end up with a long shot or a wasted chance.

When we play the poorer sides at Anfield although we create lots of chances but we don't create lots of quality chances. Take today for example, how many of our chances were absolute nailed on scoring opportunities? The type of chance a semi-decent striker would bang in 8 times out of ten, none is the answer. They were all shots from the edge of the box through a sea of defenders, scrambles in the area with one of our lads trying to squeeze a shot away surrounded by 3 baggies shirts. Contrast that with the West Brom goal, and their earlier chance when Pepe made the save (i feel like I'm missing another one I've forgotten), you would expect a decent striker to score either of those 9 times out of ten.

Against teams who play with deep back lines who sit back and soak up the pressure our type of patient build up play doesn't work. You need to move the ball much quicker before they can set themselves, ideally you want pace up front. We are far too slow all over the pitch, our quickest starter today was the right back and he's hardly lightening.

I also feel for Luis, he's the only one who consistently opens up these type of teams yet time and again no one else is on his wave length. Where's the center mid taking a gamble and bursting into the box when he turns them inside out? Where's the goal poaching striking partner who takes up good positions in the box and/or loses his marker? 

We need to get in the transfer market and buy these type of players, which is also a worry as the man tasked to do this now has been binned. Who do trust the money to in the summer? ",0,1335134004,null,0,true,0,c4fcl32,t3_sn27d,t1_c4fcl32,t3_sn27d,null,1428774749,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

true,SpasticPanda,flair2,,"As much as I love Hazard, he will never be a long term fix. 

We need to realise that his wage expectations will quickly outgrow our budget. Mr Levy is a very shrewd businessman, and those limits have helped our club. An argument could be made that these should be raised, but it is irrelevant now.

First and foremost, we need a striker. I think I have come to grips with the reality that Adebayor isn't going to take a 90k wage cut. Defoe has no presence, and although great as a poacher, can't be relied on for wins playing 90 minutes+.

Next we need cover at the rear. Rose has showed some promise, and Caulker is great at Swansea. Kaboul has developed immeasurably. Not getting Cahill has bitten us. Vertonghan is obviously the first choice, but he is as likely as a straight swap between Messi and Kranjcar. 

The last thing we need is midfield cover. It has been said elsewhere, but there are very few people is the same league as Modric. His skill is near unmatched. ",0,1335142314,null,0,false,0,c4fe0m0,t3_smi1e,t1_c4fe0m0,t1_c4fdle2,null,1428775424,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

The thing about Midnight though is that we still don't know what it was, we don't know it's motives (posses someone to leave the planet?), what it looks like, or anything. It's an enigma, which is what made it terrifying. The Angels are less so because you know about them. You know their goal (at least in their first appearance, I can't remember their second appearance all that well), their weakness, etc...

IMO, the biggest problem with most horror things today be it games, movies, or tv shows is that they explain to much. Once you know what something is and its intent it isn't scary anymore.

I have seen some teams play it beautifully though so it certainly could have its place against the right kind of team. I personally love the way [Milan in 03](http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/01/22/teams-of-the-decade-14-milan-2002-07/) set theirs up. A tireless worker, a creative/box to box type, a deep lying playmaker in between, a true #10, two true strikers. Of course they had Seedorf, Pirlo, and Rui Costa though...

Mine would probably look like this:

Cech

Ivanovic

Luiz

Terry

Cole/Bertrand

RM: Ramires

CM: Lampard/Mikel/McEachran

LM: Wish we had De Bruyne here.

Mata in the hole.

Some pair from Drogz/Sturridge/Torres that works well.

2. Striker. We might even need two. Defoe is not cutting it as a starter. Very good backup though. Adebayor is sayonara after this season. Saha has one more season as a rotation if he can stay healthy. I don't know much about Harry Kane but I'm pretty sure he's not ready. I say we go after one promising youngster and one established but not superstar pro. I nominate Clint Dempsey for the established guy because I don't think we can get Llorente. The guy leaves everything on the field every single game, good finisher, he's fantastic in the air, and he has great off the ball movement which would let him get on the end of all kinds of crosses from Bale and Lennon. I have no idea who the youngster would be. Maybe even time to give this Coulibaly kid a shot.

3. Keeper. Friedel has been good this season, but how much longer will this last? I say sign someone sooner rather than later. Apparently Hugo Lloris is available this summer? Might be nice to have the French national team keeper paired up with Kaboul. I think he would be worth every penny we spend on him.

4. Creative midfielder. We're definitely losing Modric this summer. I loved him a few months ago, but at this point I can't wait to see him go. Good riddance, let's take the money and run. Who to replace him? I would say Eden Hazard but I doubt we'll be able to sign him. We have Ceballos, a Barcelona youth academy player in the reserves. Tom Carroll is supposed to be a highly rated Paul Scholes type player. I like Christian Eriksen though. From the few times I've seen him play, he's been excellent and he's not at the level where he'd cost a ton yet either.

Everywhere else I think is fine. We've got Bale, Lennon, Rose, and Pienaar on the wings if we find a manager who knows how to rotate players. Walker at right back is a lock for the next decade or so. Assou-Ekotto could be a world-class player with proper instruction. Rose and Naughton as backups. We've got a glut of of good midfielders too. Parker is good for a few more seasons at which point I think Livermore is gonna be a stud. Huddlestone will hopefully be back at some point. Sandro is a beast. I think Kranjcar is a good player.

We need to have a fire sale this summer though. Sell Bassong, Khumalo, Modric, Bentley, Jenas, and Dos Santos. Hoilett, Kalou, Drogba, Rodallega are all available on free transfers as well.",0,1335157059,null,0,false,0,c4fgqxr,t3_smi1e,t1_c4fgqxr,t3_smi1e,null,1428776779,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,captain_ramshackle,uk,Kingston Upon Thames,"You do seem to blame me for all the evils of the world in relation to animal rights when I'm just following on from how the majority of the country acts.

Animals are regarded as property for humans to do with what they will. This is clearly shown by the following cases

* Poaching - theft of property

* Fishing without a licence - theft of property

* Cattle Rustling - theft of property

* Meat production industry - animals are bought, value is added and then sold as a product.

* Domestic pets - Bought in a shop in the same manner as any other item of property, owner is free within certain constraints to treat their property in a manner of their choosing.

You're free to dislike my views all you want, but they're just an extension of normally held beliefs.

The use of emotive terms like massacre is rather unhelpful, I'm not proposing a pogrom but instead animals would be humanely put down using tried and tested methods which are understood to be humane by most of society.

Finally I would like to refer back to your belief that dogs are part of nature. Domestic animals are unnatural, this is a key quality caused by their domestication and they should be considered part of civilisation.

I often find myself blaming the public for putting pressure on a politician to do something that looks good, depsite it not really benefitting anyone in the long term. The public are often ill-educated on politics and on how to run a city, area etc. and so demand silly little policies which of course the elected person complies with. One can liken it with the NHS bill. People cry non-specifically for a ""better NHS"" and thus a bill is produced which has no specific well thought out policies but just a window-dressed promise to ""do better"". This mayor idea would work if people realise that you can't make a city better overnight. It's a living, breathing entity that evolves with the people, not by some top-down piece of legislation. As long as people realise that, then an elected mayor can only be a good thing. If however they keep changing who they vote for because of some poxy little policy which was bad for them but actually good for the majority of the city then we'll have a problem. We need consistency in governance. If the public pulls the killswitch on an elected mayor everytime he does something mildly unpopular we'll be in trouble. People who can think things through will understand any decisions made, but the majority of people won't. If they're council tax rises by a single percentage they'll be voting for someone different next election, despite the fact that the rise in tax may well have been exactly what the city needed.

TL;DR: We need faith in the public to hold informed opinions if an elected mayor is to be a force for good.

City are an asset to the game, I have attended the most exciting game in my life through sporting lisbon whilst under their wing and have a job with them!

The die hard fans which I can never consider myself as are amazing, the first game I went to, this old geezer behind me was topping my drink up with whiskey to keep me warm. It still amazes me how city fans seem like best friends whilst still strangers - something ive not seen at any other club.

true,LS69,eng-yorkshire,We are Leeds,"&gt;But if you live somewhere where the cost of living is lower, and you stay there, then why expect to earn the same as someone who lives in an expensive area?

You've just argued that a nurse in Leeds should be paid more than a nurse in Bradford or Dewsbury. Leeds is an expensive area for housing in the region, so should the public sector workers get paid more in Leeds, than in Bradford 6 miles away?  

If you think nurses in Leeds &amp; Bradford should be paid the same, how far should a poverty stricken area have to be from an ""expensive area"" before pay becomes varied?   Who decides this?  Who pays the inevitable quango?


Besides, do you honestly think the cost of living is lower in poor areas?  Is gas and electric cheaper?  Is food? Is petrol? Are nursery/after school club costs?  Are foreign holidays cheaper?  Does Amazon offer regional pricing within the UK?

What you are really saying is the cost of housing is higher in the south.  That's entirely different to the cost of living - so different in fact, house prices aren't even included in the inflation index.

The idea that the rest of the UK should be punished with lower wages, because of a super heated southern economy is silly.  Provide cheap housing for state workers, grant planning permission to brown field sites and sell  / rent the houses/flats at cost. 

Before we start dividing up the nation, I want to see house prices included in the ""cost of living"".

The countries we should be looking at are Sweden and Holland. Sweden has fabulous outcomes and doesn't cost much more in terms of percentage GDP than the NHS. Holland has the highest consumer satisfaction rating in Europe. 

If the NHS reforms were to take a long hard look at these two systems, try some pilot studies, see what works well here, institute slow incremental improvements, then they might stand some chance of success. Unfortunately they are not like that. They have some fatal flaws:

* Speed of implementation. The bill was rushed and is hugely flawed.

* Private sector involvement. It works well in Holland, but it won't work here. In Holland the system is in control of the providers. In the UK the providers have captured the system. GP consortia aren't allowed to reject private providers. The regulator (Monitor) is made up of people seconded from KPMG and McKinsey - who also helped draft the legislation.

* Bureaucracy. The new system has more layers of bureaucracy than the one it replaces, and creates a fragmented system of competing providers who have no incentive to work together and deliver a joined up service.

* vagueness. The bill is incredibly vague and leaves a lot of detail to yet-to-be-decided regulations, which will be bent and twisted by private sector provider lobbying.

* Opaqueness. The private sector providers are exempt from Freedom of Information legislation. Recently an FoI request relating to McKinsey was turned down because there was a risk that it might affect their ability to pick up future NHS business.

That's the privilege you get just for being white. I know it's pretty awesome to have that, believe me i do, it gets us all kinds of places in life, you know? It helps us get jobs ('white' sounding names get more call-backs for jobs) it has helped us throughout history be the 'dominant' race (look at how many black members of parliment are there vs. white, why do white people throughout history hold more positions of authority?) it also has helped us throughout history accumulate more wealth than black people (black wealth is a fraction of that of white people) it also stops us getting constantly harassed by the police for nothing more than having a different skin colour. Statistics show that young black people are overrepresented at every stage of the criminal justice system. But let's get some perspective on that shall we?. In 84.7% of offences in 2004-05 involving young offenders aged 10-17, the young people involved classified their ethnicity as white. Kinda strange huh?

[Check out this nice report](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmhaff/181/18105.htm) (just read the first subheading's info if you really want to hold onto your racist views though dude) for some more info.


How about jobs though? Here's some copy&amp;pasted info for you to take in:

&gt;Racialized employment networks can benefit whites at the expense of blacks. In a study published in 2003, sociologist Deirdre A. Royster compared black and white males who graduated from the same school with the same skills. In looking at their success with school-work transition and working experiences, she found that white graduates were more often employed in skilled trades, earned more, held higher status positions, received more promotions and experienced shorter periods of unemployment. Since all other factors were similar, the differences in employment experiences were attributed to race. Royster concluded that the primary cause of these racial differences was due to social networking. The concept of ""who you know"" seemed just as important to these graduates as ""what you know.""

&gt;Since older white males predominantly control blue-collar trades, they are more likely to offer varying forms of assistance to those in their social network, often other whites. Assistance can be anything from job vacancy information, referrals, direct job recruitment, formal and informal training, and vouching behavior and leniency in supervision. This assistance disproportionately available to whites is an advantage that often puts black men at a disadvantage in the employment sector, ""these ideologies provide a contemporary deathblow to working-class black men's chances of establishing a foothold in the traditional trades.""

Here's where that study can be found:

http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520239517


Now you referred to black people as ""n***..err.. blacks"" (censoring not mine), which is a pretty racist thing to do. Firstly, you call them ""n*..err"" for some reason censoring the word 'nigger' as if it'll make your post any less racist. You use a word which has constantly been used to dehumanize and oppress an entire race of people for a long amount of time, while at the same time somehow pretending that you're not a racist, and that spannerface is confused about what racist means. I'd say this was a bit of a mistake on your part but i don't think you'd really understand what that means.

You then go on to say that racism is: ""jump me because they don't like the colour of my skin.""

Not to get started on how terrible your dictionary writing skills would be, but this isn't really a real example of racism that you've experiences is it? You may or may not have been jumped by a group of black people, but to then claim that it's 'because they don't like the colour of my skin' is, if i were to say, nothing but a work of fiction and falsehood. If that were the reason then yes, it's racist, but, Mr. Pot, if you somehow think that that's racist, but that calling black people 'niggers' isn't, and that somehow you're taking the high ground by (**so**)bravely standing up for white people in this oppressed society that they live in, i'd like to introduce you to Mr. Kettle, i'm sure what you want to call him will roll right off your tongue.

Then you go on to make massive uninformed generalisations that:

A) Spannerface hates white people (lolwut)

B) Hating white people is 'typical'

both of those are incorrect.
