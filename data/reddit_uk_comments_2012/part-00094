The tragicness of the situation. So much of his life is shit. He's broke, no one can see what he sees, no one appreciates what he appreciates, and most importantly he's constantly tormented by his inner demons. It's a dark existence.

Then he finds out that he's regarded as one of the greatest artists of all time. Suddenly his life has meaning (in the sense that we often derive meaning from others). He isn't just appreciated, he's fucking lauded as a timeless genius. Everything that he desires and works for has been granted.

But as wonderful as that is, he knows he won't be around to see it. There's an inevitable sacrifice which needs to be made. He's sacrificing himself rather than sacrificing somone else, but it's a sacrifice nonetheless. The things that made him so wonderful are the same things which will force him to kill himself.

I say all that based, partly, on two quotes:

&gt; The Doctor: Vincent, can I help?

&gt;Van Gogh: It's so clear you cannot help. And when you leave—and everyone always leaves—I will be left once more with an empty heart and no hope.

&gt;The Doctor: My experience is that there is, you know, surprisingly always hope.

&gt;Van Gogh: Then your experience is incomplete! I know how it will end. And it will not end well.

And this one most importantly:

&gt;  We have fought monsters together and we have won. On my own, I fear I may not do so well.

I fucking love that quote. Because, you know, not all monsters are dragons. Some monsters exist in your head and unfortunately they're just as real and just as dangerous. That line alone captures the wonderfulness of fighting monsters as well as being resigned to the fact that you'll eventually lose. All of that information, the tragicness of fighting a losing (but worthy?) fight, gets carried in those two sentences. The pride of beating them. The knowledge that one day they'll beat you. The wondering of how to live with that knowledge.

All of that tragicness is, for me, brought out when you see him crying in the showroom. He knows that the fates, as it were, have determined that the only way that will happen is when he loses his fight with his inner monsters and sacrifices himself.

Nevertheless, both signings surprised me. In truth, anyone who heard the way Jones was building him up after the Farsley game could have half-expected it, but beating Bradford City to signing a striker does little to make me excited - regardless of his pedigree.

As for Ashdown, he was just one of those players I subconsciously thought would never join Leeds. I don't know why, but he struck me as one of those names you hear once in a while and that's it.

true,hackbinary,scottish,Scotland,"Actually, you are wrong.  This is not the free market working, but failing.  

First we import milk to make cheese and other dairy products.  

Second, a few very large mega-corporations have been forcing the milk prices down, while the cost of production has being going up.  

Third, the farmers do not really have a choice in choosing who they can sell their milk to and under what terms.  They have to sign contracts of 3 to 5 years with all the milk producers because that is the industry practice, and their only option is take the term or leave it.  If they are lucky enough to have another dairy to take their milk to, their terms are almost identical because of the market forces higher up the supply chain.

If you want to draw an analogy, then draw one that fits.  Perhaps we could consider bank accounts as a more appropriate analogy.  While there are a large number banks which we can choose to have a bank account with, the legal terms of the bank account are all roughly the same.  We do not have a choice about what can go in and go out.  Maybe I do not want my personal information shared with 3rd parties.  Too bad, they share your information with various credit reporting agencies, you have not choice in the matter.  That is not a free market.

This is not a free market, perhaps it is capitalist.  You can't have a free market where there is a massive disparity of power between the actors.  In a free market, all the actors have roughly the same amount of power in negotiating their contracts, and this is something that the farmers do not.

If you have left school with nothing to show for it then frankly no one is going to hire you, even at min wage, when they can pick from an ever growing pool of foreigners who are happy to work for minimum wage (or less) and can already do the job. Why would they when they will have to babysit you for weeks before you can do the job? So, thanks to the failings of our narrow minded and poorly run education system we have a problem with a significant number of kids leaving school who are no use to anyone. So on to welfare they go, and before you know it you have endemic poverty combined with an ever climbing welfare bill. Combine that with an aging population, BRIC nations on the rise, the wheels having fallen off of our debt fueled economy, and the welfare state is unsustainable. 

So I would firstly state that the problems with our education system are the bigger issue here, it doesn't really produce the type of workers we need and it doesn't do enough to help kids who go a crap deal in life before they were born. So apprenticeships like this are needed, because without then the kids who failed school and were failed by school will have very little chance to do better.

Skipping through to the 1970s. The owners at the time were over-extending themselves and the club was in financial trouble.

Ken Bates bought the club and the grounds in 1982 for a pound and injected some much needed cash, but there were still some financial squables.

In 1992 the club was still in a dire financial situation, old man Bates fixed it by selling the grounds and the Stamford Bridge name to the Chelsea Pitch Owners.

In 1994 Matthew Harding (RIP), financially saved us. We all owe him a debt of gratitude, all our new fans must know his name.

Cue that Gronkjaer goal against Liverpool, we are in the Champions League at the expense of Liverpool and Roman buys the club.

Today the CPO and the club disagree. All realise that Roman cares for the club but the owners of the grounds do not wish to leave the Bridge, whereas Roman has grander ambitions.

Now, the CPO and the owner's representatives are disagreeing over shares. It's an interesting story and if you care about CFC you aught to keep an eye on it.

Comment now edited to include more info...

There were 5 resolutions up for vote at this EGM, as usual it quickly descended into a slanging match and I'm pretty surprised a couple of people weren't excluded for their constant and flagrant disregard of the rules. Way too many tin foil hats in there, mainly from some hardline SayNoCPO lot and the 55's, 55 being an obvious allusion to the capacity they are convinced Stamford Bridge can accomodate

Resolution 1: Let the board sell up to 1,000 new shares. Passed. This is good for the board, it's openly acknowledged that they have been buying up shares left, right and centre to help tilt the vote in their favour. Limit remains at 100 max per person (£10000 worth) so all manner of people with (sometimes vague) links to the board have found themselves as 100-share CPOs. Of course, all these people will vote while some older CPOs forget to, so it helps to get to 75% needed

Resolution 2: Permitting the board to sell shares to new shareholders. Passed. See above, more will be bought up by people with ties to Roman, Gourlay, Buck etc. 

Resolution 3: Restricting voting rights to 10 per person. Failed. This was supposed to stop all these new 100-share CPOs skewing the vote in the club's favour. SNCPO and 55s were worried they'd get crowded out as they lack the funds to buy up the same number of shares, so they tried to reduce the influence of each vote by a factor of 10, which would hurt the 100-share members more than the 10 share members, in terms of influence anyway

Resolution 4: Requiring each CPO board member to also be a shareholder. Passed. Nothing too crucial, housekeeping really. Anyone serving in the upper levels of CPO should have a vested interest in the issues at hand

Resolution 5: Giving board authority to investigate anti-profiteering measures. Passed. I like this a lot, these shares were bought to give the club security, not to try and charge them 10 times what you paid to buy them back. I have no problem with giving people more than £100 per share, but only the equivalent of whatever they paid in today's money. For instance, if they buy in 1992 the £100 they spent per share is really £169 each now. Those buying shares recently should only get £100 back. Believe the CPO still owes the club around £8m which is part of the security to stop the CPO going rogue and trying to sell the freehold under the club",0,1343078106,null,0,1343120706,0,c5iajos,t3_x0ozb,t1_c5iajos,t3_x0ozb,null,1429450468,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

You get to experience a Doctor and companion relationship that is almost like a father and daughter, and is based on the relationship children (aka fans, because we are all children when watching Doctor Who) have with the Doctor and the show. Also, it's an immense amount of fun. 

I can't really say much about the transition between Doctors because I started with 11 last year, with the beginning of series 6. He's my Doctor. He's very different, but harkens back to the classic Doctors a little, and you see his growing ""dark side"" (self-loathing) explored throughout series 6 especially. He's young, but he's delightfully manic and a sort of ""best-friend"" Doctor--someone you are not intimidated by, and is not an overly overdone ""hero""--but I always took away that father or mentor figure, and he definitely appears old and troubled sometimes. He just holds it in and doesn't take it out on his companions, because they are what makes him happy. And that is why I watch Doctor Who when I am upset, and why it is my favorite show.

&gt;In all seriousness:  after they have had x kids (maybe 2 or 3) offer them £10,000 to have their tubes tied.  Men who have already defaulted on child payments, let them off their arrears (while compensating the mother from a government fund) if they have a vasectomy.  Maybe shove in £5,000 for them as well.

&gt;Essentially:  offer them a big enough immediate cash bonus that they choose sterilisation, rather than go on to bleed the taxpayer for what will eventually be a fuckload more.  Many of these people are short-term in their outlook, £10,000 for booze, fags and a flatscreen will be more than welcome.

true,hackbinary,scottish,Scotland,"Hi Pharsalus,
I think you over simplifying the issues at hand.  I have prepared a more detailed response below, but I would sum your argument up as ""UK Dairy Farms are not competitive in the 'free' market.""

My argument is that:
1.) There is no such thing as a free market
2.) We want to maintain a diverse group of dairy farms
3.) UK farmers have a heavy regulatory burden
4.) There is actually enough money already in a bottle of milk to pay the farmers fairly
5.) I do not agree that dairy farmers in the UK are ineffient, and I wonder where you came up with that.

We both agree that farmers will have get paid more, but only after a consolidation of the number of farmers. You conceded that when you said ""
&gt;the ability of the remaining farmers to define more suitable terms will return

So, in the end, if we both agree that price that farmers are paid must go up, then why are you insisting that there needs to be fewer farmers?


&gt; A free market requires free trade 

There is no such thing as a free market, or free trade.  Captains of industry will attempt to externalize all non-direct costs, such as water quality responsibly.  We all want clean drinking water.  Now, if you produce your product in a jurisdiction where your regulatory requirements are more than mine, water quality, air quality, the amount and type of drugs that are safe to put in a food product, animal welfare rights, whatever, then your product is going to be more expensive than mine.  None of the markets in any countries are free.  The UK has the highest animal welfare standards in the world.  In the UK, cow must be given time to graze on open fields, in the USA they don't.  UK dairy farms are among the most efficient in the world, given the constraints that they have to operate under.  We certainly do not live in a free market, although we may live in a capitalist market, controlled by a relatively small number of people.  And I didn't even mention occupational health and safety.  We good protection for workers in the UK, but the regulations are much lower in other places, and we have to compete, and I don't think that is right.  That is not free trade.

&gt; The Corn Laws

I do not think that is germane to anything we are talking about.  We are talking about modern UK dairy farming, with modern regulations, and vastly different constraints.  

&gt;We as consumers demand cheap, high quality produce, and everybody wants to get the best value for money when shopping.

Consumers are not provided with all the information to make informed decisions about the products they consume.  What pesticides are used on the produce that you consume?  Are people who purchase produce that is flown in from Chile paying the whole cost of their products?  Are they paying the cost of the resulting environmental pollution that come from air freighting their products in? 

&gt; The supermarkets are undercutting each other to gain our custom, which is great for us consumers. It's also good for the dairy farming industry, the environment and the economy, because it drives technological innovation and efficiency gains, meaning that the carbon footprint of your milk is reduced, and less energy (both human and chemical/electrical) is used in it's production.

Actually the retail model of undercutting your competition based on price point is obsolete.  It is now about customer/client experience.  Part of that is price, part of that is customer service.  It takes years to gain a customer, and seconds to loose one.

I don't think we can 'technically' innovate cows anymore than they have been.  Their udders when full already drag on the ground.  Farmers watch the lactation rates of their cows very carefully, and the cows are put down when they become not as productive as the younger cows.  My value equation is not just a function of price, and I bet yours is not either, but I suspect it has greater weight than in mine.

&gt;&gt; If they are lucky enough to have another dairy to take their milk to, their terms are almost identical because of the market forces higher up the supply chain.

&gt; This is pretty much a textbook example of a saturated market experiencing oversupply. 

Or the Dairies are engaging in monopolistic and anti-competitive practices.  Either-way you are now agreeing that the price has to go up.  My preference would be to maintain diversity of production.  And if you believe in a free market, then you need to have the conditions that will give us diversity.

You could argue that the broadband market is saturated, but actually it is basically a duopoly between BT and Virgin.  The complete unwillingness of the UK government act is shocking, and actually  one of the greatest issues that the UK economy is going to have. 

&gt; the reality is that farming is an industry and a profession

I agree, and farmers deserve to earn a good living like the rest of us.  Lawyers, doctors, accountants, engineers all can earn good livings, and why are farmers different?  As technical professional, I can market my skill-set worldwide, and I do not have capital constraints that farmers have.  Another concern is maintaining food security, outsourcing our food production is not wise--remember the potato famine?  I also am not convinced that outsourcing work to India produced more value in the UK economy.",0,1343081200,null,0,1343082920,0,c5ibfnk,t3_wz29x,t1_c5ibfnk,t1_c5iaaib,null,1429450891,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,ghostridethewhip,null,null,"I do see where you are coming from. He has very slow feet, and his reactions are slow as well. He's pretty poor at holding the ball up for being so huge. His touch is poor.

The main point I would make is that he just turned 19 and has not played at a highly competitive level in over a year now. If you need an indication of the potential he has, [check out his two seasons with RSC Anderlecht](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romelu_Lukaku):

    09/10 season- 16 years old
    19 goals
    7 assists
    Anderlecht finishes atop league standings by 12 points
    Anderlecht wins Championship playoff
    Lukaku is top scorer in the league
    
    10/11 season- 17 years old
    20 goals
    7 assists
    Anderlecht finishes atop league standings
    Anderlecht finishes third in Championship playoff

Those are some pretty phenomenal stats for such a young player. More importantly, watch some of his youtube compilations and videos of his highlights from Anderlecht matches. He was a dominant force in front of goal, a great finisher, and he had a lot of flair as well. The Lukaku we are seeing in the US matches is likely 1) not fit yet, as it is early in the summer still, 2) young and inexperienced, and 3) far from being in top form, since he received very little quality playing time last season.

If we get him out on loan to a decent team where he will get plenty of minutes, I think it will be a great indicator of what he can do and if he can perform for us (FTR, I'm almost certain he can). I wouldn't base too much at all on these summer matches. That goes for other players as well. There is the occasional revelation (Sturridge last summer), but generally its just meant to get the guys a run out before the season starts and to let some fans overseas check out the players in person.",0,1343081760,null,0,false,0,c5ibl2m,t3_x1dje,t1_c5ibl2m,t3_x1dje,null,1429450972,7,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,7

How knowledgeable would you say you are about the show on a 1-10 scale? (1 being none, 10 being a master of all things Who.)
7. I’ve seen all of NewWho many times, but I’ve only watched key episodes of the original series. I also own a book on TARDIS history.
If you have watched the show before, in a short paragraph, who is your favorite character? Why?
That’s so difficult! I would have to say Rose Tyler, followed by Rory. Rose always holds a special place in my Doctor Who filled heart, because she was the first companion I ever met and based my standards of what a companion was. Plus, I loved the 10th doctor and her.  Rory came more slowly, but that’s because I think it needed more development to explain who he was and his place along side the Doctor. I loved Amy’s plotlines (oh god, the girl who waited!) but I don’t think she could be my favorite because I think so much of that is the Doctor’s plot developing more then Amy really becoming her own character. (Although character development could be such a longer discussion!)

&gt;At present, the closest we have to a national estimate comes from CEOP's 2011 scoping study into ""localised grooming"", roughly synonymous with on-street grooming. Response rates to the researchers request for data from police, children's services and the third sector, were low. Based on these patchy data, CEOP suggest there are over 2,000 ""potential offenders"" in the UK. Most of these, however, will never have been formally identified, let alone arrested, charged or prosecuted. Ethnicity data were available for just one-third. Of these, 49% were white and 46% Asian: the proportion of Pakistani Asians remains unknown. However, in a country where Asians constitute 7% of the general population, this is a striking figure.

Matt's episodes seem to leave me confused and wondering what the heck just happened. Moffat is a really good writer but sometimes I think it just gets a little bit out of hand.

Show them episodes that really display what Doctor Who is and what it means to its fans. Find episodes that show that it is a sci-fi show that is just as much about the characters as it is about spaceships. That it is a scary show with elements of comedy. That it can be completely serious one week and as mad as a box of frogs the next.

Episodes I recommend showing with the three in bold being the three I would show all new fans: Dalek, Father's Day, The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, Tooth and Claw, School Reunion, **The Girl in the Fireplace**, The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit, **Smith and Jones**, Human Nature/The Family of Blood, Blink, Voyage of the Damned, The Fires of Pompeii, Midnight, The Waters of Mars, Amy's Choice, **Vincent and the Doctor**, The Doctor's Wife*, The Girl Who Waited.

*Might be a bit canon-heavy, but arguably the best episode of the Smith era and possibly even in the whole of New Who as far as I am concerned.

None of these will have any major spoilers for people who want to get into the show in a serious way but will still give a pretty damn good flavour of the show.

BUT....

Bear in mind the medical workforce here is rather over saturated. The last Government increased medical student numbers by 50% and they have stayed at this level, despite no huge increase in hospital doctor numbers. At my medical school, we are now telling students that up to a third of them will not get internships (and so will never be able to practise). 

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9177635/Glut-of-NHS-doctors-by-2020-report-warns.html

http://careers.bmj.com/careers/advice/view-article.html?id=20007002

The situation is most acute for hospital doctors, but the large numbers in GP are also worrying. The way GPs are setup here, the partner of the Practice makes the management decisions and all the money. This is a privileged position, they do not share out easily. The majority of GPs are then hired as salaried GP by the Partners with varying terms and conditions and various salaries. With more and more doctors coming out, the pay will get less and less. Indeed hospital doctors have not had a pay rise in the last 4 years.

Also bear in mind the NHS is being literally given away to the private sector at present, with large multinational companies already running NHS services. http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/mar/15/devon-nhs-childrens-services-privatisation

The combination of too many doctors and profiteering private companies will only have one result, poorer pay and conditions.

The disillusionment in the profession has never been higher. We have already had one day of Industrial Action (our first in 40 years!) and (whilst I am not a supporter of this) I suspect more are on the cards. http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/blog/2012/jun/21/doctors-strike-pensions-live-coverage

I would think long and hard before coming here as a doctor. Indeed many of us here are and emigrating to Australia, New Zealand and Canada.

-----------

Just read that back and it sounds rather pessimistic! Sorry to be a damp squib! Will attempt some balance...

-------------

On the plus side, the training system is very well controlled and designed, resulting in experienced and capable doctors. Our patients are grateful and considerate. the NHS is still an amazing institution, where patient care is still the main priority and I feel honoured to work for it. 

Best of luck!

Because *every single assaulted female* of the Asian gang was *white*.

Why is The Guardian trying to manipulate its readers into believing white newspaper editors are racist - instead of accepting that a group of Asian men in Rochdale wanted to rape girls of a different race?

Why can't The Guardian accept that racism exists in non-white people, too?

&gt; Whatever the case, we know that abuse of white girls is not a cultural or religious issue because there is no longstanding history of it taking place in Asia or the Muslim world.

Interesting. I didn't know white girls were readily available in ""Asia or the Muslim world"". The Guardian seems to think there are.

&gt;  In fact, the reason I am writing this is that I am neither Asian nor Muslim nor Pakistani, so I cannot be accused of being in denial or trying to hide a painful truth. But I am black, and I know how racism works; and, more than that, I have a background in maths and science, so I know you can't extrapolate a tiny, flawed set of data and use it to make a sweeping generalisation.

The author is black and trying to push a racism agenda on white people? Anybody shocked by this? And I'm curious: is the author trying to say that *being* black gives a superior insight into ""racism""? And how is such an attitude of superiority based on skin-colour *not* racist?

&gt; While our media continue to exclude minority voices in general, such lazy racial generalisations are likely to continue. Even the story of a single Asian man acting alone in a sex case made the headlines.

I'm curious: how did this Guardian author miss the ""racist"" white lady on a tram, and ""racist"" white boy tweeting about footballers stories? Maybe this Guardian author can explain why calling somebody a ""choc ice"" appears to be okay if you're black.

**Summary**

It is exactly this manipulative sensationalism - that puts The Guardian on the same footing as The Daily Mail. But it's worse. The Guardian is trying to arouse dangerous sentiments - in labelling white people as intrinsically racist - where overwhelming facts in a story point in another direction.

If you're going to steal from your customers why not do it the old fashion way and stick 'em up?

The difference between robbery and negotiation is that you actually take other people into account in your actions.

But unilateral strike action forces customers to pay the price for the wage negotiations. Their days are ruined. They lose the value of their Olympic Tickets, their wage at work, their holiday, the wedding they were going to see, the christining of their cousin's baby, etc.

Nine was much more bloodthirsty, as a result of the Time War, Rose made him more human, affecting Ten, that much has already been covered. I think, basically, Rose sums it up retty well in Journey's End, when she's talking to the ""real"" Doctor, and she tells him, ""But he won't be ***you***."" He's still the Doctor, throughout all his regenerations, but I think he gets used to that form that he's in, the personality and the quirks, the people, and his attitude. Ten especially was the most human out of the past three regenerations, and that was thanks to his companions, and his next regeneration will be the death of that particular form, and everything about him. All the memories are still there, but it's a new model of himself to learn all about, and I think that's what scares him.

And trust me, it's perfectly natural to be concerned about the inner state of fictional characters. If people didn't, books would never be made into movies. Lol.

Individually, they are dodging more tax. They have more money, so they pay more tax, so in avoiding paying that tax they are disenfranchising society to a greater degree.

I realise that, for the little guy, their combined taxes amount to something significant. But, individually, they are not disenfranchising society to the same degree. And lets keep this in proportion: we're probably talking about a small proportion of the incomes of some of the lower paid members of our society here. They have more to lose (since they have less) and they have taken less wealth from society. I feel we should cut them some slack.

They either need to loosen their requirements and train people or pay more.

Universities will never be able to adequately cover the skills needed for employment. The fields are too vast and teaching the generalities is the best that can be done. The sticking point is that companies have no model for bringing in people and training them. That is the skill gap. It won't be crossed with more graduates.

Why are you persistently using one Professor as an example? Not having a grasp of stats is not essential for bioscience, it is damned useful if you want to publish data that relies on it. But it is not the essential that you are making it out to be. If you use stats packages you need a basic understanding, which can be self taught or taught at GSCE level. Hence so 'essential' need for a higher maths. 

'If you are honestly telling me it is widespread that this is not the case then I'm going to go with my ""Biology isn't science"" claim. It is absolutely vital. If not you cannot actually substantiate any claim you are making.' 

Claim what? That you don't always need to have advanced maths for bioscience? Well quite frankly you don't need advanced maths. You need to understand logs, division, concentration, molarity, co efficients,  and a few other things. Undergrads with A* in maths have struggles to understand those concepts, simply because of what they are. They are not difficult, but it takes a little time to get your head round them. 
Oh and if you are going to cherry pick with one man, have a look at [this](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/1880) chap, impressive profile huh? He is very well respected and eminent professor in his field. And he is ""shit at maths"" his quote. He knows the maths he needs for use every day in the lab, same as most bioscientists. That is all you need.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; This isn't some linear scale we're talking about here, where some folk have more and some have less. In the UK, the richest 10% own more than half of the UK's wealth. That is disproportionate!

and this is true around the world, and always has been. There will always be rich people, and even if you got the 10% down to 50%, you would still have very very poor and very very rich people. 

&gt; And as for the ""earned it"" argument, this is flawed reasoning. You are implying that because the money was earned it is, therefore, fairly distributed. 

No I'm not. I never said anything about fair. I said they earned it, or inherited it. 

unfortunately, life isn't fair. people are poor, some poor people get rich, some rich people get poor, etc etc. no one *deserves* anything, apart from equal treatment, opportunities, rights etc. no one deserves money, or a certain amount of money. they don't come into this world with any and they don't leave with any. 

If you want to take from the rich simply because they *have* more, I think that's morally bankrupt. It denies the basic human right of ownership of property, that's what is yours is yours, and I can't take what's yours because I believe I need it more than you do.

&gt; Right ok, lets agree on that one for the moment. What does it have to do with bioscience? And tell me again why exactly biology is not a science? 

Science involves more than just studying individual datapoints. You need to establish wider truths based upon those datapoints. Take physics. It isn't enough to say that a rock fell. You have to say why it fell and link it into a wider theory. When Newton crafted a mechanical framework it was science. The previous studies that only measured how certain phenomena acted were not science (at least on their own).

The phenomenology is a vital part of scientific process. However without the steps in which you create a wider theoretical framework you don't have science. It is hard to do this without understanding statistics.

//edit - BTW I think Biology is science and uses stats as appropriate. There are also more weird areas in Biology which stretch the boundaries of what would normally be considered empirical science.

I agree but this is the problem I have.

9% of the difference between my income and 15K is taken as student loan repayment

Mortgage costs are far higher than they have been historically as a % of income

Cost of living has increased as a % of income since the 1980s, especially utilities and fuel.

I've refused to join company pension schemes that had any final salary component for some of the participants as I am not going to pay for a luxury I will never be able to make use of.

At the moment I pay 5% and my company pays 3% into a private pension. I started this when I was 28 (so a bit late (but I was busy buying a house)) and this is not going to be anywhere near enough to retire on. To get an acceptable standard of living I'd need to move my contribution upto around 15% of my salary which would have a significant impact on my lifestyle and will only be achievable when I pay my student loan off.

I'm also very wary about doing this as everyone I know who started a pension post 2004 has seen it either lose money or grow at a rate which is informally described as absolute wank. Yet even though the performance of these pensions has been shit the fees aren't lowered.

Should we prevent some people from performing an action because a group of people can not perform the same action without suffering harm? In this case while many people may be able to gamble safely a subset of gamblers can not do it safely. This would be fine if they only affected themselves but it has knock on effects to their families (if they have one).

My suggestion would be the following.

Allow gambling but have it licensed and make it personally licensed. This means that you can only bet by charging a government provided card with money and using that to gamble with. This means that all winnings and loses are available and can be tracked against reported income. If the system determines that you have a problem then the following measures are implemented.

* Proceedings start to mark you as unemployable in any position where you can embezzle or are trusted with the care of other people's assets.

* The amount you can gamble is restricted.

* A financial firewall is created to block off shared assets so that you can't liquidate them and to protect the gamblers family.


I hate this as it seems incredibly totalitarian but I think it's better than letting people destroy their lives and those around them.

That doesn't justify such a disproportionate distribution of wealth.

&gt; There will always be rich people, and even if you got the 10% down to 50%, you would still have very very poor and very very rich people.

Yes there will. But there will be *fewer* poor people and *fewer* rich people and the situation will have improved.

&gt; No I'm not. I never said anything about fair.

OK, I'm sorry. I had thought that you implied that because the money was earned, it was therefore distributed fairly.

&gt; unfortunately, life isn't fair. [...] no one deserves anything, apart from equal treatment, opportunities, rights etc.

We are in complete agreement. Unfortunately, those are not the conditions that we live in in the UK.

&gt; If you want to take from the rich simply because they have more, I think that's morally bankrupt.

I don't personally ""want to take from the rich"". But I do believe that they have a greater responsibility to contribute to society, since they have taken (lawfully accumulated) a disproportionate share of it's wealth. If they paid their taxes, like the rest of us are expected to, we woudn't be having this conversation!  :o)

The reason that I initially used the word ""taken"", rather than just ""accumulated"", was actually because I wanted to convey that every pound accumulated is a pound taken away from society. When you get the point that 10% of the UK has over half of its wealth, then you get a point where this is grossly unfair.

""Some £1.4bn of the Games' £11.4bn budget comes from private sector sponsors.

The thing is, you claim this isn't simple garden work, but actually the more complicated a job is, the more work there is for completely unskilled people. Say you are laying a massive multi-stage concrete floor: 

* there's drilling holes in existing concrete and sticking short bits of rebar in them
* cutting long bits of rebar into short connecting rods with a disc cutter
* setting out mesh stands at regular intervals
* tying mesh together with wire and wire cutters
* using the air hose to get the crap out before the pour
* then there's using the vibrator to get the concrete into the cracks
* even holding the chute from a concrete pump is an easy job

2) Rose. She grows up a lot, and I admire her ability to be endlessly generous and kind. In addition, I really relate to her love for the Doctor, and vice versa. I'm engaged, and I thought fairy tale love was a lie until I met him. Love at first sight, Soul Mates, all that stuff? I totally feel it, despite not believing in it before (or really, still. Weird, I know. I'll let you know when I figure it out). And right now, we're 2 hours away from each other, broke, with one car between us that is falling apart rapidly. Yeah, I empathize, and that's probably driving my (secret?) love for reunion fics.

Although I agree, Rory's grown on me. :)

4) It depends... are we assuming decent driving skills and no emergencies? :) Honestly, I would want to take the scenic route to seeing my own galaxy... Start with my town and pretty much zoom out.

In the longer term, I can see Suarez, Henderson or Shelvey making good captains. Assuming the latter 2 step up their game and become first team regulars, they both have good leadership qualities and could potentially become the ""new Gerrard"".

&gt; On outsourcing: One of the arguments for worker-owned coops is that democratically controlled workplaces don't generally act against the interests of their workers, and outsourcing (in many if not most cases) would be seen as a particularly pernicious example of this. Of course, the ""discipline of the market"" under capitalism drives non-capitalist organisations in directions they don't wish to go. 

It depends what outsourcing it is. With something like cleaners it's actually more efficient to have cleaners who work an 8ish hour shift and will clean 4 or so offices in that time than it is for an office to employ it's own cleaners for 2 hours a day. So in that regard I don't think outsourcing is detrimental to anyone involved. However when it comes to outsourcing major functions to a 3rd party who operates for profit, such as IT (I work for a major multi-billion $ IT outsourcing firm) then I think it's a terrible idea for a different reason. In the position I'm in now, working for an outsourcer after being TUPE'd across from the client, time after time after time the interests of my employer are almost diametrically opposed to the interests of the client. As a result it's not the workers on either side who are harmed, it's the client who is in a position where simple things IT used to do are now separate projects which will cost them far more. For example, turning an old out of warranty server into an FTP server is no longer a matter of throwing a copy of FreeBSD onto the server and configuring it when you have time, it turns into a project which suddenly costs the client around £10K in parts and labor. 

So in a way I do agree with you when it comes to issues with capitalism, but where we differ is that I think the problems are not a result of capitalism itself, but one of culture. In particular the cult of the individual, where everyone is considered to be special, important, unique and their needs, wants and desires are paramount. And this is something which is stronger in the US than it is in the UK, but still very much a part of British post-war culture. You see this time and time again on Reddit, even in the UK subs, people going on and on about their rights with little if any thought given to their responsibilities as a member of society. Just look at peoples views on drugs, they talk about ""It's my body, what right does anyone have to tell me what I can put inside it!!?"" in the same breath as demanding a tax payer funded universal healthcare system to help them should they fuck themselves up on dope. 

What is missing from anglo-us culture is the sense of shared responsibility as part of a culture, the idea that we have to put things into our culture to benefit us all and that our own needs, wants and desires might not be the most important ones out there. And strangely enough it's the progressives we have to thank for this, not conservatives. Even Thatcher touched on this with her ""there is no such thing but society"" quote (the full text), where she talked about the need to for people to help each other, not to expect Society (or the state) to just fix things.

&gt; As for the skill component, there are obviously exceptions - it's hard for everyone to be a fully-trained brain surgeon one day a week, and I'm not sure anyone would want that, but it's notable that professions are largely created with restrictions on entry, certification, licensing, limited university places etc. in order to benefit those in the profession with higher rewards and status, rather than to protect the public from incompetent practitioners. The pool of talent amongst blue-collar working people is far larger than the current numbers practising in such professions would lead you to believe, and if you don't accept that then consider what happened when women entered the workforce and consider how many women doctors, lawyers, etc there are now. Incidentally, this is one of the reasons that Mondragon includes a university as part of its corporate structure.

I keep saying this, our education system, especially the bullshit ""progressive"" changes brought about by socialists since the war have done more to screw over people from poor backgrounds than anything else. And as a result, not only do we have people happily leaving school at 16 despite not being able to read a McDonalds menu, we have very talented kids who never got the education they needed to make the most of it. And this is why my first priority after successfully seizing power would be a dramatic reform of education.

Keeps it cool in summer and the heat in during winter.  Problem is between them and the humid air the large stone walls make for a big temperature difference which builds condensation.

It's not really a problem though.  You can get dehumidifying salts that you can put in an open jam jar and sit in the bottom of your wardrobes (you might want to watch that if you have kids or pets).  You can also buy similar packs of salts that hang from plastic sleeves you can put over coat hangers.  Added to that I bought a suitcase sized dehumidifier.  Put it in a room, open the wardrobes and drawers, close the door, and let it run for several hours and you're fine.  Just rotate it around a few rooms a couple of times a year and you're fine.  There's no need to run it all day, every day.  Not by a long shot.  Not unless you're living under a waterfall.  We also tend to do a bit of a spring and autumnal wardrobe clean where everything comes out and is washed before we get a whiff of mould.

Other than the wardrobes the only real problem arises where a warm room meets a cooler room and there is an air draft.  You'd think the draft would blow the condensation away, but next to the draft you'll get dead spots, just like in a flowing river you get eddy currents that create static points.  It's not really a problem in the summer or winter because the family room doors are generally either all open or all closed.  If it's too cool outside to open up the outside doors and windows, put a radiator on in the cooler room/hallway for a little bit and the problem doesn't arise. 

It's not a question of too hot or too cold, it's a case of uniform heat, or keeping the rooms you want hotter (living room in the winter) or cooler (bedrooms in the summer), their doors closed, and drafts/air currents out.

Other houses all seem to have A/C units but I've never really found the need, plus A/C sucks the soul out of the air and makes me feel ill.

&gt;In their latest returns to the Certification Officer, 36 trade unions have reported that they gave their general secretaries or chief executives pay and benefits of more than £100,000. 

and then 

&gt;According to the Institute of Directors, the average basic pay of a managing director in a small company (turnover up to £5 million a year) was £70,000. At a medium-sized company (turnover up to £50 million a year) it was £100,000

So he is comparing the full pay (basic + benefits) of union directors to the basic pay of company directors? Seems a bit lop sided as union directors are normally not part of any share deals, huge bonuses etc, unlike private company directors where a large part of their income is made from outside of the basic pay they receive.

The law for civil courts says that it only has to prove guilt based on the balance of probability, not on beyond reasonable doubt.

Nonetheless the DEA was also meant to deal with situations like that from GoldenEye - anyone who had a connection that was caught infringing was going to be sent a warning telling them to secure their connection (and how) so that it wouldn't happen again.  Specifically it was not meant to just hand out details willy nilly to those claiming copyright infringement.

Yes, he worked at a top law firm that practices tax law.  He then entered politics and has helped introduce GAAR as proposed by the Aaronson Study, the findings of which the Treasury, for which he works, in the last budget said they agreed with.

A top tax lawyer who has cut his teeth in the city enters politics, where his loyalty is expected to shift from his employer's clients to the interest of the public,  and then he promotes a General Anti-Abuse Rule.

How is that in any way hypocritical?

It's like saying a top mechanical engineer working for Porsche who does his very best is hypocritical if he then gets a job at Ferrari and again does his very best.   

It's not that he's hypocritical - it's that he's QUALIFIED and actually doing his job as he's supposed to!  For once there's actually a guy who knows exactly what he's doing, can stand before the Treasury and address it, and has played a role himself in extending the Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes system.

Heaven forbid we should actually have someone who knows how the tax system works and where the loopholes are working in the Treasury, working to close the loopholes!!!

              ""Reinvesting money to make sure we stay on top of the fight – £917 million in 
              additional resources committed towards tackling evasion and avoidance over 
              the spending review period, which will bring in around £7 billion per year in 
              additional revenue by 2014. 

              And last month, we issued our consultation on a General Anti-Abuse Rule, aimed 
              at deterring and tackling abusive schemes with a new rule that is effective 
              against the most egregious arrangements. 

              It will act as a further deterrent to those engaging in abusive schemes, and 
              improve our ability to secure payment of the right amount of tax.""

You're confusing hypocritical with competent, and he's competent because he's a top tax lawyer now working for the public.

The UKBA is taxed to breaking point at this very minute. Its a goddamn kafka-esque comedy of errors and bad management that the staff are trying to get rectified.

Massive queues through immigration at heathrow due to the lack of staff (while spending £2.5million on new uniforms), and having to fly staff down from manchester airport to cope with demand.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/30/heathrow-waiting-times-breached

Guns and drugs checks being dropped due to the lack of capability.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2012/may/05/border-checks-drugs-customs-heathrow

In an attempt to plug the gap of actual trained border control staff, the home office is basically pulling other staff from wherever they are, giving them a couple of hours training and plunking them on the border:

http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/12/london-2012-heathrow-border-passport-olympics

....and then only a couple of weeks later a story about how these replacement staff are fucking up left right and center when it comes to things like not letting suspected terrorists into the country due to them being woefully undertrained:

&gt;Many of those drafted in to help cope with border staffing shortages before the Olympics are individuals who have been working elsewhere in the Home Office and have received only basic training to work on airport passport desks. *Some have had only a day's training instead of the standard six to eight weeks.*

http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jul/14/heathrow-checks-miss-terror-suspects

Within the last fortnight the national audit office has come to the conclusion that 1000 more staff were cut than neccessary, and the original process of cutting and restructuring done in such a comically bad fashion of essentially ignoring reality and assuming everything would happen in a land filled with rainbows and unicorns:

&gt;The report added: “Loss of focus, poor governance and a tendency towards optimism bias in planning, delivery and reporting, have contributed to the current problems.”

The UoE have a great international team for welcoming new students from foreign climes and introducing them to their fellow students, and it is very multicultural. 

The only thing is Edinburgh is one of the elite Universities in the UK (After Oxford, Cambridge, St. Andrews it's arguably the 4th best university in the UK) so you need great grades to get in. I'm not sure how the Canadian system works but here on average you need 4 to 5 A's from Highers (which would be akin to the exams in your final year of high school) or Advanced Highers (which are the next level up from Highers). I believe you need to find out your International Baccalaureate information to find out how your qualifications translate to the Scottish system. After you have that it's fairly easy to see on the UoE prospectus what you need to get in. 

Be aware that it will be super expensive because you are not only not from Scotland, but outside the EU, probably upwards of £10,000 a year (don't quote me on that but my university charged around that and that wasn't UoE and it was about 5 years ago). As it stands it costs £3,600 for UK students and they get heavily subsidised tuition fees. Edinburgh is a pretty expensive city as well so expect £400-700 per month rents for apartments.",0,1343144455,null,0,false,0,c5inkgf,t3_x240f,t1_c5inkgf,t3_x240f,null,1429456696,3,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,3

Agger would probably be my first choice but he has been very injury prone in the last years, although last season he seemed to get fairly well through it.

Lucas, if he keeps playing like he has been doing in the last couple of years I could see him getting the captains armband, he isnt exactly the loud type of a player though which you often want to see from your captain.

Skrtel has been playing so well in the last couple of seasons and rarely gets injured which is a good thing since you want your captain on the field as often as possible, hes also the type that can get loud

Italics = Very popular but I personally don't like it.

**Red Dwarf**

**Peep Show** (Couldn't recommend anything better, it's bloody fantastic)

The Inbetweeners

Brass Eye


**The Day Today**

**I'm Alan Partridge**

Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge

The League of Gentlemen

**Spaced**

*The Mighty Boosh*

*Black Books*

**The IT Crowd**

**The Fast Show** (Classic sketch show, Paul Whitehouse is a legend and Johnny Depp is an enormous fan with cameos in some episodes)

Absolutely Fabulous

Comic Strip Presents (Lots of one off episodes and a bit hit and miss. My favourite is, 'War', and 'Five go mad in Dorset')

**Men Behaving Badly** (Highly recommend)

**Bottom** (Insanely violent slapstick humour but I absolutely fucking love it, certainly not to everyones taste but IMO a fantastically hilarious series)

The Vicar of Dibley

**Only Fools and Horses** (One of the greatest series of all time but probably more difficult for foreign audiences to grasp in some instances)

**Blackadder**

*Father Ted*

*The Royle Family*

Extras

**The Young Ones** (A bit dated, same humour as Bottom)

**Rab C. Nesbitt** (Good luck understanding it but damn hilarious)

*Gavin and Stacy* (Hugely successful)

Banksy is admired because he brought street art to the world of high art.

He did that because he successfully juxtaposes imagery with contemporary events.

Brighton is a main station and has fast connections to London (ie. under an hour to London Bridge, for example).

It really depends on where you're going to live and where you'll be going every day. I'm not sure what the universities are like for parking, I've never been, but they're not right in the center of Brighton so I can't see it being that much of a problem.

Suso, I would like to be loaned out to a CHAMPIONSHIP league team, he needs to get used to the physicality of EPL somehow; this would be a 6 month loan (maybe make it full-year depending on Liverpool's needs and his progression).
Dani looked good, perhaps he should see a good amount of europa league, and some national cup action. 
I hope my judgement of charlie is wrong, but I wouldnt mind him being used as a way of sweetening the deal for Gaston Ramirez or maybe even Dempsey.


Obviously, it would be better if all three (4 if you count raheem) would have an impact on the first team immediately.

Tricks:-

* Spam the fuck out of comparison sites. Get all your details on and keep generating new quotes at all hours of the day. Tweak your mileage, job title, etc just a little each time and watch your premiums change. Go for fully comp even if you own a shit car (it's often cheaper).

* Put two people you know who are in their 40-50s on your policy as *named* drivers. This should cut your premium a fair wedge. Note, this is *not* fronting and is totally above board. Fronting is when the main driver (you, an expensive young scallywag) is down as a named driver, and some geriatric is the policy holder.

* You can get policies with black boxes that limit your hours of use, but they are usually shit deals.

I also went to someone's party at a tower block in Stockport, and that was OK too. Again, the outside was shitty, but the hallways were clean and the flat wasn't bad. Again, a nice view, and IMHO that makes or breaks a living space. 

Things to check for: damp walls, especially hidden behind furniture; are the hallways dirty?; does the intercom work?; does the lift work?; is there a security/handyman/janitor guy on the premises or easily reachable?; what to do with the rubbish? I would check out some of the other floors too, i.e. walk down the stairs rather than use the lift so you can have a nosy at the other tenants. It may also be a gated community, one that you need a code to get into, and that's a good thing. I would also walk round the area at varying times of the day, especially in the evening.

Shelvey and Suso are good enough to play in the Premiership (not every game, but 10-15) and I think it's more important to give them that experience here than loaning them out.  Spearing I cold give or take, Adam I would give (as in give away).  That leaves Gerrard, Lucas, Aquilani, Henderson, Shelvey, and Suso as the players battling for the three midfield spots.  I think a first choice of Lucas-Gerrard-Henderson, with Aquilani getting 20-25 matches, Shelvey getting 15-20 matches, and Suso getting 10-15 matches would be the ideal for us.  Spearing can be defensive cover.  Also, Gerrard will likely not be able to play every game, so we can keep Aqua happy rotating in.  If the rumours of Joe Allen are true, then I hope (despite my earlier intention) that we send Shelvey out on loan for the season to Swansea (where he will hopefully start most matches in a similar system to ours) and Allen fits in to the midfield rotation ahead of Aquilani and Henderson, reducing their games slightly; that will also reduce the load on Gerrard.",0,1343166711,null,0,false,0,c5itym3,t3_x34kx,t1_c5itym3,t3_x34kx,null,1429459780,13,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,13

There's a scene where it's fairly obvious that she can't see, and the Angels slowly start to turn their heads, and the scene culminates with one Angel reaching out in stone form to grab Amy before she is teleported away. Thus, it does seem like Angels are fully sentient while they are stone. This seems to contradict the Doctor's idea that they just ""cease the exist"" and turn to stone when they are being observed, but that can be explained easily by the fact that the Doctor didn't know all that much about them (he only found out in the episode prior that an image of an Angel becomes an Angel), and he was just going by their legend when he said that. Another explanation is that the Angels were aware something was up, and so went into a sort of half-stone half-Angel form.",0,1343167155,null,0,false,0,c5iu2yu,t3_x2pi9,t1_c5iu2yu,t1_c5it6e7,null,1429459827,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The thing is, science undergrad degrees are harder. I had 30 hours of lectures and practicals a week. My friend doing business studies at the time had 7 hours a week.

Someone who graduates with science degree will need a PhD to have a career in science. So they will do a PhD with typical funding of £12-16k tax free. That's equivalent to a salary of 21k for 4 years.

They spend 4 years with that money, then maybe get a postdoc paying £30k by the time they are 26-27. That will be a short-term (usually 1-2 year) post. Not much security and you'll likely have to move. That's about the time you'd want to start a family, but the job is insecure and doesn't pay that well considering you've been graduated for 4-5 years by now.

It's just not worth it.

My friend doing business studies went to join an accounting company. Her salary was 19k, 23k, 26k during qualifying. Then 36k when she qualified. Then she left to go to an investment bank where she was earning 70k plus bonuses.

What it is is an end to being ruled by middle-right wing Eton types who privatize everything from the NHS to the fecking [driving test examiners](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18782372). They have [no shame whatsoever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Care_UK#Controversies) and many of those involved stand to personally benefit financially from this. UK Labour is much the same in these practices. This is the sole reason why the SNP has a majority government right now. The people of Scotland very clearly do not want any of this. 

An independent Scotland is an ""improvement"", not a salvation. It will still rain all the time and Jeremy Kyle will still be on our TV. What we will be able to do is to take some our money that is traditionally being used on pro-London projects like Canary Warf and invest it into our own cities. We can keep the NHS nationalised forever (England has 10-20 years left max, the tide is unstoppable). We can avoid wars like Iraq that make us hated around the world and cause us to have to give up our liberties due to the revenge attacks. We might even get a full motorway between our two biggest cities. They don't even have an electrified rail link at present. It's a farce!

We can debate how much of an improvement or not it will be all you want, but besides not liking Salmon your argument has no merit. If Scotland does become independent it won't be a dictatorship ""regime of Salmond"". A genuinely left wing Labour will resurface and I suspect there will be a more centric Scottish Tory party. It will be back to a working democracy. Unless of course you have a plan to fix Westminster?

I know what you're getting at, though, and I generally agree. I just think the wing spot might be too much work for him at this point, and he wouldn't be able to do it game after game for a whole season. Dempsey would be a good guy to rotate him with.

The problem is that you can only do this with one player, or two at the most, where you are winning a game. When you have 15-20 players that you need to develop and work out if they are worth the first team how are you supposed to give them all a go without loaning them out?

true,[deleted],null,null,"To add on to what you said (very well said, by the way), Vincent and the Doctor is truly a outstanding episode. Watched it a few nights ago for the first time and it is quite possibly my favorite so far. It was extremely touching; I couldn’t help but well up with tears. 

Something that is so tragically wonderful about this episode is that there’s a bittersweet ending.  Beyond just being a Doctor Who episode, Van Gogh was a real man who never realized the mark he left. His demons don’t go away, even when the scary monsters are defeated, but the fragile joy of friendship, humanity and creation still endure. Too remarkable an episode to not be one of the best. An ideal Doctor Who episode/scenario; bring someone from the past and briefly show them that they are NOT insignificant, that their name &amp; influence lives on and on. 

I had to watch it twice to fully grasp the concept, and once I did, I understood what was *so* touching about it. Vincent being the only one around him to see the monster, it makes his perspective of the world around him quite literally otherworldly. The monster represents loneliness at its most extreme. It was abandoned by its own kind in a strange world, driven helplessly insane and left to its own devices. Compare the monster's predicament to that of Van Gogh's and you begin to see they are kindred souls and that is no better portrayed as when near the end he looks up at the night sky. 

I have a copy of The Starry Night hanging on my wall back home. Never saw it as anything but an overwhelmingly beautiful painting until now.  Now it's so much more.  “For my part I know nothing with any certainty, but the sight of the stars makes me dream.""

In other news, I really need to stop investing so much of myself into (sort of) fictional characters. Will proceed to go drown my sorrows in a bottle of cheap wine now.

They have broken a lot of the major transfer stories in this window, but the other papers are now just copying them without credit (which is what goal.com did do, before they were bought out). 

They have over 400 journalists now in over 50 countries and produce the major soccer wires for the major papers (so you are probably reading their stories anyway). They are the largest provider of football news in the world by a very large margin. They have hired away a lot of the decent opinion writers. Newspapers are dying and being replaced and goal.com is now one of the major sources of soccer news. You can either continue to ignore this and be prejudiced about it and read re-hashes of their stories on other newspaper sites, or just deal with it.

I half-agree with you when you say that newspapers just rehash what other papers have put out. However, this isn't always the case. Remember recently when the whole world bandwagoned on Ramirez joining us, and out of the blue, the Echo stood alone in the media world and called bullshit on it. 

Don't get me wrong, Goal.com pump out a lot more articles than their counterpart, and are one of the leaders in transfer speculation.

Yes it originally started as a plot convenience, but over the past 49 years is has become an integral part of the mythos.

If you can't get past the cheesy special effects, avoid Classic Who and just watch New Who, which has some of the best acting and writing of any show on TV right now imo (and I watch LOTS of different series, from different countries and genres).

* Gylfi and Vertonghen  played well, happy to see them in the team.
* Middle of the midfield was a pair of backups, and it showed. Good effort by Townsend, but neither he nor Livermore were able to run the offense from the midfield or spread the ball around, I think we lacked cohesion on offense and that's the cause. Shouldn't be an issue with Modric/Moutinho/whoever.

Agree w comments about Bale (far and away our best player tonight) as well as BAE, Gylfi, Azza, Andros and Huddlestone. Tommy definitely needs some time to shake off the rust, but he did hit Bentley in stride w a 70yd cross field ball, so he clearly hasn't forgotten how to pass. 

I thought Gylfi had several nice turns/1st touches in tight spaces, something that is a Modric speciality. His ball to Bale for the goal was very good as well. 

Our back line looked out of sorts, clearly still adapting to AVBs preferred high line. Was a little surprised at Vetonghen getting taking advantage of in the air, but he did very well otherwise. Would have liked to see Caulker given some time, assume we'll see him in Bmore on Saturday.

Hope Walker and VDV are ok, both seemed to be walking ok up to the tunnel. I think Walker got the back of his keg/Achilles stepped on, and obviously no reason to take any chances in a friendly.

1) Tottenham showed a few holes in the high back line, and it's just gonna take some time and work to sort that out, because they definitely have the players

2) the only real mistake from a Spurs player tonight was by Bassong, who was out of position and probably won't even be on the team when the season starts (and just to add in, I thought BAE looked real well tonight)

3) Gareth Bale is going to be a monster this year...I know I said I'd try to stay away from the obvious, but holy shit, can he fly...I could literally just watch clips of him running (and actually have on several occasions), and he's gonna be huge for us this year",0,1343193289,null,0,false,0,c5j0k0f,t3_x467n,t1_c5j0k0f,t3_x467n,null,1429462953,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3
