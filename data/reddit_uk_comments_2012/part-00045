I'm from rural Maine. Diversity is *very* sparce in these areas that haven't seen much of the exodus from Southern Plantations *or* immigration from ports.

And this is Florida, the one location in America with the most hate groups. I *fully* understand that racism is *faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar* from being gone. Really I should have made it clear that I was speaking proportionately. How race was handled just fifty to sixty years ago compared to how it's handled now.

I'm not saying it's eradicated (hardly!) but it is dying, and society has been exponentially moving away from that line of thinking as the intolerant generations are dying off.

That is gimmicky, but I think it would at least be an excusable gimmick. There is no excuse for a gimmick now, and that really was the point I was trying to make.

And on the subject of an African-American actor playing the Doctor please look again at Chiwetel Ejiofor, one of the most championed of the runners-up. The BBC has no problem with a pan-sexual main character or any other ""risky"" decisions with Doctor Who (they even gave Jack his own show *filled* with homosexual and bisexual characters).

He starts off as a renegade Time Lord and that's clear enough.  Then he returns badly disfigured and looking for a new cycle of lives, still fairly clear. But then it gets weird.  The Master revitalizes himself by possessing the body of another being on the planet Traken.  Then he gets executed by the Daleks only for his remains to turn into some kind of sentient oil slick that slides into Eric Roberts.  Then he turns up having apparently been given a new Gallifreyan body and cycle of regenerations, only to die and be cremated Viking-style and then he's resurrected by...I don't know, magic or whatever, and becomes a flying ghoul who shoots magic energy bolts.

The point is, a lot of viewers probably have the idea that the Master is some kind of magical demonic entity that possesses people because too often the show has made it seem that way.

I have been going *on tour* explaining just *how* ridiculous this idea is, and I will share it for you now:

Rory's not been more agitated or hostile, he's just been more decicive with his actions. He's never been cruel or malicious or even short-tempered with those he loves. Even when Amy [The Girl Who Waited SPOILERS:](/s ""was trapped for thirty-six years and treated him with bitterness""), he still found empathy and love for her. He similarly shows compassion to [The Rebel Flesh SPOILERS:](/s ""the Gangers"") when even Amy wouldn't.

Secondly, Rory complains of a headache because he (like the viewing audience) is blown away by the sheer ridiculous incomprehensibility  that is [Let's Kill Hitler SPOILERS:](/s ""realizing his best friend is also his daughter, is also River Song"") and wants to cool off for a minute.

Thirdly, the alarm noise is called the Cloister Bell. It has no ties to the Master in particular and goes off *whenever* the TARDIS is on the verge of dying or is caught up in an emergency. It also has been linked to signaling the Doctor's death (as seen in Logopolis and arguably in Waters of Mars).

Fourth, Rory did not have a room in The god Complex because the point of the ""hotel"" was [The God Complex SPOILERS:](/s ""not to simply scare people or show them their fears, but to expose the raw emotional energy connecting them with what they had faith in. Rory had no faith and hence had no room""). And even if he *did* have a room, how does the Doctor's room making a specific noise have *anything* to do with Rory?

Fifth, how could Rory even *be* the Master? Amy had an entire childhood with him (Let's Kill Hitler) and the Master [End of Time SPOILERS:](/s ""is currently trapped within the Time Lock""). Similarly, what does the Master have to gain by pretending to be Rory? It's not like they'd use the [Utopia SPOILERS:](/s ""Master in human body through use of a Fob Watch"") plot *again*.

Bottom line: this ""theory"" holds literally no water when inspected with even the slightest degree of scrutiny. It honestly just *does not make sense*.

true,Wirstead,smith,Smith,"Thinking about it, when Rose left and the Doctor met Donna for the first time, he saw two people dancing and they reminded him of him and Rose. Most people can relate to seeing strangers and being reminded of a lost love. When he meets Martha, he meets a woman who is so much like Rose. A strong, beautiful woman capable of keeping up with him. She can do almost anything Rose could. She can keep up with the doctor, help in her own special, human way, and keep the Doctor in check. It hurts being reminded of lost love when you see strangers, but knowing someone who is so much like Rose is even worst. He tries to fool himself, when Martha tries to help, and the Doctor knows she can, he tries to pretend that Martha isn't as good as Rose because he doesn't want her to be. He says, ""Rose would know what to do,"" because he knows Rose would and he doesn't want to believe that Martha is just as capable as Rose. I feel that if the roles were switched, he would be in love with Martha and when he met Rose, he would act like she isn't as good. When Martha leaves, she tells him that she can't waste her life on someone who won't be with her. This makes the Doctor realize that, because Rose is gone, he needs to get over her, or at least stop dwelling on her parting because he knows she can't come back. He'll stop comparing others to Rose. When he meets Donna a second time, he's done dwelling on Rose, and Donna notices that he's better. He thinks to himself ""I have met you twice, in all of space and time (21st Century London) I have met you twice."" Donna has proven herself a capable companion and the Doctor doesn't believe in coincidences. I feel that's why he was rude to Martha, but seemed to instantly get over everything and be happy with Donna.

true,Philomathematic,hartnell,Hartnell,"[This](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft) pretty well details the intersecting bits between Doctor Who and Lovecraft. Some of the mythos elements have made their way into the Whoniverse, such as the Great Old Ones, but no, there has never been a devoted H.P. Lovecraft episode in the sense that the TARDIS team takes on Great C'thulhu.

That being said, I think that weird fiction would be an interesting genre for Doctor Who to explore. Bear in mind that the show *is* meant to be suitable for children. Additionally, I think the tone of Lovecraft's work is a bit at odds with Doctor Who. One core tenet of Lovecraft is that the Great Old Ones are beyond morality, they are alien and wholly inscrutable. This doesn't quite fit with the moral dynamic of Doctor Who, in my opinion, especially since the show takes an essentially optimistic tone.

Overall, I think that gothic horror rather than weird horror tends to be more Doctor Who-ish. Gothic horror has an explanation and a solution, whereas the best you can do in the face of the eldritch is hope that you're eaten last. And in a show that usually seeks to resolve problems and not do grievous harm to its main characters, this may not work. There have been some truly devastating things that have happened to companions over the years, but actually going mad is not one I'm familiar with.

That being said, we may be able to rationalize certain aspects of Doctor Who into Lovecraftian terms. The unexplained echo thing from Midnight? Quite possibly eldritch. The Master going insane by looking into the Untempered Schism? Classic Lovecraft. The Devil? Could be something even more alien and unknowable.

So, tl;dr - No, there hasn't been a true H.P. Lovecraft episode, but on the other hand, there may be reasons for it. Also, just a thought, Lovecraft was an American, and American historical figures are a bit more rare in Doctor Who than ones like Wells or van Gogh.",0,1334815963,null,0,false,0,c4e2889,t3_sh3b6,t1_c4e2889,t3_sh3b6,null,1428752481,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Blink leaves a lot more room for speculation. 

Also, in Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone, the Angels gain the ability to kill outright. Strangely enough, I don't find that nearly as disturbing as being sent back in time. It's an end. The story is over, and there's nothing left to imagine.  However, if you're displaced in time, anything could happen. Sure, everything could turn out all right, but what if it doesn't?

If Carroll continues growing as a target man, the balls he wins in the box would be right in Mart√≠nez and Gerrard's preferred scoring zone.

The problem is that although it has increased above official inflation figures in real terms of purchasing parity inflation had previously been set artificially low.  It's set artificially low because the Keynesian economics was abandoned around 2005 and whilst the world economy is struggling the UK is in the position of still having to slash the deficit.

If they're talking about rises in 2010-2011 and the budget went up and when efficiency savings hadn't yet taken effect, the problem clearly lies elsewhere.  The budget is held hostage to inflation which in real terms creates a shortfall.  They budget more than the previous year, and they have, and then interest goes up and suddenly there's a problem which can only be addressed the following budget, but then the whole process repeats itself.

true,mszegedy,tennant,Tennant,"Nah, I'm just a hobbyist. I want nothing to formally do with the field of linguistics. Lots to organize and research, but it has to stop somewhere, right? And the pay isn't too good, either. My mother, on the other hand, is/was indeed a linguist. She did practical applications: ESL, speech therapy, that kind of stuff. This is the reason my house is full of textbooks on linguistics written by Chomsky and Russian and German and Greek written by well-meaning companies who assume (correctly?) that the average person doesn't know IPA and make it frustrating for me to learn the actual pronunciation on my own. ...for me to read. Bluh.

Anyway, case is an example of a grammatical category. These are each a series of names describing different forms of different facets of a language. Cases describe the role of a noun. Tenses describe the time of a verb. Number describes the amount of things a word refers to. Aspect describes the particular fabric of time of a verb. Mood describes... you know what, I still can't come up with a satisfying explanation. The point is, though, the more complex the grammar of a language is, the more grammatical categories you need to describe it.

Actually, that's a pretty good measure of the complexity of a language. The ones I listed, are pretty standard and exist in pretty much every language (Hungarian doesn't actually really have aspect, though), and it's really only a matter of which ones (English has two cases for nouns, and three for pronouns; it has three tenses, and at least three aspects; it has two numbers; it has two voices, but one is periphrastic in its conjugation; it has just over two moods, because the subjunctive barely counts and the interrogative isn't considered one in this case). Beyond those, however, there are more exotic and obscure ones. Wikipedia lists a handful. Evidentiality, for example, is a common one: how do you know how an action took place? Imagine having to append a verb ending for each one: ""I know that,"" ""I saw that,"" ""I heard that,"" ""I felt that,"" ""It is said that,"" ""I believe that,"" it really goes on as far as the language takes it. Animacy is also popular, and in fact *not* present in English: we have ""he, she, it"", which could theoretically be used to describe animacy, with ""it"" referring to objects that do not move whatsoever... however, we ruin this by using ""it"" on most of our animals, and for good reason (there are no good alternatives available in the language). One that is very rare and is considered inappropriate to add to a constructed language because it's obviously because you want it to be so damn EXOTIC is associativity, which, when added onto a noun, denotes not only the noun itself, but also a group of people associated with that noun. This is used almost exclusively only on people. For example, when I say ""nagymama"" in Hungarian, I am to mean my grandmother and her only. However, ""nagymam√°***√©k***"" refers to not only her, but my grandfather as well, and anyone else living in their household (which used to be my aunt, but now it refers only to a single songbird and a chipmunk). It does get awkward to use, though, for omitting another person, so I just wind up saying ""nagymam√°√©k meg nagyap√°√©k"" (that is, ""grandmother and co. and grandfather and co."") in order to compensate. You can see why it's not very popular! The more insignificant these categories get, the less likely they are to be formally called such.

Most categories only have a single member (like this one!), and it's just called a ""feature"" of the language or something, a particular thing that this sort of noun can do. But in reality, it's an entire category with infinite potential! What if I were to invent a language with a form of associativity that refers only to females? Or people with beards? Or tattoos? Or tattoos of beards? Or scars on their left scrotum? Anything can be expanded upon this way! However, it's only the *useful* ones that are kept. *That's* why nearly all languages have that particular list of categories I told you about further up. *Those* are the ones they found useful! (Except noun class; I have no idea why anyone bothers with those. And imagine verb class, like in all of the languages you know. \*shudder* That's why people complain about ""irregular"" verbs in English; they're all part of the verb class known as ""strong verbs"", which you must be totes familiar with by now.) Who needs fifteen kinds of associativity when it's much more useful to have another aspect?

I think you'd like Japanese. I studied it for a year or two, but never made much headway. The only thing I took with me was the alphabet, which you'll have a lot of *fun* memorizing. There is no inflection at all that I remember, but the *vocabulary* is so damn interesting. And I mean the vocabulary that is tied to grammar. Like, there are THREE kinds of cardinal numbers, all for counting different things. I'll be damned if I can remember what, though. And why do they have to have so many pronouns? Because pronouns are AWESOME. You can convey more nuance in a pronoun in Japanese than you could do in a sentence in English. I heartily reccommend it! Me, I prefer bales upon bales of inflection. A fully conjugates English verb could fill a couple sticky notes, if you write smallish. A Latin verb, a page or two. An Arabic verb? It can conjugate something like 1.7 million different ways! And I want to learn every last one of them. That's the kind of thing that I find fascinating. You? Who knows! Go and see! You've tried your hand at synthetic languages, and you speak an analytical one. You've seen subject-first languages, now go and try topic-first ones! There's just so many things you can learn about it's hardly a risible subject. What entices you more, the complex mechanics of disassembling a verb to make room for a new mood, or the novelty of making mental distinctions between things that you previously never even thought to categorize? Find out!

I think the system is this:

1. unknown machine requests page.
2. webserver generates session id, and returns it rendered in a hidden field in the markup.
3. session id is passed via get/post each trip round the server.

But obviously, this doesn't allow you to persist anything, so 'remember me' options and stuff would be impossible since as you say, you can't reliably get a unique identifier from a computer within the scope of browser. Interesting to consider the options though.

Hypocritical because the naked ladies are clearly porn of some kind, and a children who like to read the news might (for some reason) choose to read the daily mail. If they truly cared about children not seeing lots of porn everywhere then they might want to start by thinking about not showing it so clearly in their website.

If you want a third question, in a week when South America has begun to call on the US for an end to the War on Drugs, a former second in command chief at MI6, Nigel Inkster, someone who as Assistant Chief and Director of Operations and Intelligence supervised Britian's fight against drug barons has said that the War on Drugs has failed and only added to global insecurity, and in doing so joining the ranks of others such as ex-MI5 boss Eliza Manningham-Buller, Sir Richard Branson, ex-Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth and UK Bar Council Chairman Nicholas Green QC in calling for a rethink on the War on Drugs.  And that this in itself could free up efficiency savings in both the prison service and the police.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"My bits, might be a bit too serious, but sorry:

* The banning of all political parties, associations and lobbying groups. Only individuals can stand for election at any level of government. Cabinet positions to be selected based on a competency framework (i.e. you cannot become chancellor without an understanding of economics).

* Complete reform of UK drug policy based on a fully independent scientific inquiry and review of all legal and illegal substances and current law. Action to be taken based on social and personal harm, with a slight tilt towards what you put into your own body is your own business as long as it doesn't harm others.

* The abolishment of the current structure of government in favour of a decentralised system based on the swiss canton model in which all UK kingdoms get their own parliament and a joint british parliament is used by local kingdom representatives (so you don't end up with to parliamentary members for local and national representation) for joint requirements such as defence of the realm and foreign policy.

* The disestablishment of the crown corporation's power base in the city of london and the return of such power to the people of the city of london as a standard london borough.

* The abolition of the TV Licence and transition from BBC state funding as is to a channel more in-line with Channel 4. The BBC will no longer need to return funds to the treasury over and above that which it receives from the treasury, and will be able to directly profit from international sales instead of the funky BBC Worldwide arrangement, in order to offset the TV Licence cost.

* No media establishment (including the BBC post transition) may have more than 20% of shares held directly or indirectly by an individual shareholder. For the avoidance of doubt, the ownership of companies investing in other companies must be clearly defined to avoid a breach of this.

* Complete re-evaluation of the penal and justice system, the expulsion of security service mandarins from the home office and a science-based reform looking at financial and social costs, balance of justice, evidence and with the standard moral and political constraints removed (as in, if the review says capital punishment is good for non-moral reasons it would not be seen to damage the review as a whole).

* Reform of education based on building a society that questions authority rather than indoctrinating subservient people who are told they'll never get on in life because of a grade they received. Children to be taught how to manage money, credit and debt in schools as well as how to save up and invest money instead of blowing it on the short term. Children to be taught how to learn, critical thinking and on the importance of the golden rule instead of thinking solely for themselves.

* The winding down of the special relationship and ties with europe. Free trade welcome, political hegemony not so much. Foreign policy based on Ataturk's ""Peace at home, peace in the world"". Irish neutrality. Offers of independence to all remaining UK territories including those on the mainland subject to a referendum.

* Voting to be made compulsory by law. If you miss a vote there will be a fine for a local election and a non-custodial sentence for a general election. Persistent repeat offences may result in sentences of up to 6 months in prison.

* All crimes to be reduced to forms of theft from another in order to be seen as suc. Murder will become the theft of life. Rape will be the theft of sexual integrity. Assault will be the theft of physical well-being. If it cannot be defined in terms of depriving someone, no law will be able to render an act criminal. Smoking cannabis in your own home on your own cannot be defined as an act of theft from another, therefore would not be a crime. A protest that does not deprive others cannot be a crime. A judicial committee will be established to oversee what can and cannot be a crime and will be subject to public oversight.

* End of corporate personhood. Directors and partners will be personally, civilly and criminally responsible for the acts of their companies. Companies will not be permitted to exist in the UK without UK directors, partners etc.",0,1334842759,null,0,false,0,c4e4oxm,t3_shnlg,t1_c4e4oxm,t3_shnlg,null,1428753646,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

The CVF's are going to have 72MW of power when the engines are going full trot, so I suppose that there is enough for EMALS, however I'm still guessing that the power requirements would have created somewhat of a nightmare in as much as that around 10% of the ships power would have been required for the EMALS during all launch times, which I'm guessing isn't nothing when you're restricted by a lack of the glowing green.

true,Obidom,cnty-uk,Cheshire,"Essentially the difference is that Schools are accountable to the Local Education authority, Academies are not.

Academies will is theory have more power over their finances, curriculum and setting of teachers Salaries. They will still be using tax payers funds which they will obtain from central Government rather than the local authority.

For example the new academy where I live is being run by Chester university Church of England. One of the first things they have done is to take the 'free School Bus' from students and levy a charge of between ¬£300 to ¬£600 per year depending on where you're travelling from. This allows them to use the transport funding for something else.

Academies do not have to follow the National Curriculum as long as their teaching is Broad and Balanced. 

Effectively it will allow schools to run with less red tape, thus reducing the Education burden on local authorities. It will also encourage schools to perform a lot better as parents have more choice on where to send kids.

true,henleyregatta,hampshire,Hampshire,"There are a few practical (rather than fundamental) problems with your suggestion:

1) The UK has never operated anything the size of a Nimitz class. I'm pretty sure they wouldn't fit into Portsmouth Harbour (which is where the current CVNs are based and, I believe, the QE class will follow). I remember watching the DD+50 celebrations in Southampton Water, and the Nimitz-class brought along for that *dwarfed* HMS Ark Royal (and everything else). 

2) I believe I'm right in saying that we've never operated any nuclear-powered surface vessels. Much less of a practical problem, as there is comprehensive experience in the Submarine world of this form of power plant. 

3) A Nimitz-class Air Wing is normally around 80 aircraft. That's probably comparable with the total number of mission-ready aircraft in the RAF on any given day, these days (I'm aware that the numbers of in-service aircraft is *much* higher than this, but how many could have a couple of bombs strapped on, Jet-A pumped into the tanks, and flown off right *now*?)

However, there's a bigger problem with your proposal: I don't believe the US would ever lease a Nimitz-class to any other country. Wanna find out just how special our special relationship isn't? Go ahead and ask to borrow one of America's symbols of national status and power. 


In terms of what we can afford, I think we're closer to the US Marine's CVE / LHD class like the current USS Wasp.

Perfect immortality somehow eventually transmutes you into a floating head?

Also, in the episode where the Face of Boe was introduced, many things about him were identified as myths or stories.  The fact that he was the last of his species was not.

So, we're left with a single human turning into a giant head through some inexplicable process, founding a new species (presumably through some form of asexual reproduction) and then surviving that species' extinction.

Stupid.

They ought to excise that 'revelation' from the episode, never broadcast it again, and pretend it never happened.

Even in June it can get freezing at night, and not being able to sleep because you're cold can completely ruin a camping trip. Get some proper sleeping bags. They last for years and you'll appreciate them. Thick socks to sleep in too.

Also a torch is alright, but you'll want some sort of lantern. The light given off by an electric lamp is normally quite blue/harsh - not very conducive to a cosy atmosphere! Campingaz lanterns are alright and if you look out for cheap gas cartridges, they're not too expensive to run. Candles are dangerous and banned on most sites.

Washing bowl - for sticking all your dirty plates in for the walk to the sinks.

Penknife comes in handy, as do earplugs (unless you like being woken by wood pigeons at 4am). Also some decent scissors.

Firepit. You can get folding ones from B+M bargains for 15 quid. Pick up a sack of logs on the way to the campsite - farms often sell huge sacks for a fiver. Most sites don't allow fires/bbq unless they're raised off the grass.

Black bags. Handy for rubbish, even handier when you find out your tent is leaking and you need to keep your stuff dry. Also useful for storing muddy boots/dirty clothes.

Heavy duty pegs and mallet. Pegs that come with tents are about as useful as a chocolate teapot. You'll spend hours bashing/bending them into wet ground, just for them to pop out at the slightest gust of wind.

Puncture repair kit, duck tape - both useful for on the spot tent repairs!

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt; The UK has never operated anything the size of a Nimitz class. I'm pretty sure they wouldn't fit into Portsmouth Harbour (which is where the current CVNs are based and, I believe, the QE class will follow).

You may well be right, but ignoring the whole independence issue, there are a couple of candidates in Scotland. Rosyth could be modified to fit one (essentially combine two dry docks), and if depth is the problem then Faslane or the Cromarty Firth would all be perfectly capable. I agree it's an issue, but if you're spending many billions already you can afford to spend a few hundred million to build or upgrade a naval base.

Sure, Nimitz's dwarfed our light aircraft carriers (5 to 1 size ratio) but our new ones will be 60% of the size of Nimitz's - not so disparate.

&gt; I believe I'm right in saying that we've never operated any nuclear-powered surface vessels. Much less of a practical problem, as there is comprehensive experience in the Submarine world of this form of power plant.

You've never done anything until you have. We know how nukes work in this country, we've got the experience, we've got plenty of nuclear powered subs - the only reason we avoided nuclear for this was because of supposedly high costs, although I'd be willing to put money on the fact that the cost overall would be lower, because at least you pay once and that's it.

&gt;A Nimitz-class Air Wing is normally around 80 aircraft. That's probably comparable with the total number of mission-ready aircraft in the RAF on any given day, these days (I'm aware that the numbers of in-service aircraft is much higher than this, but how many could have a couple of bombs strapped on, Jet-A pumped into the tanks, and flown off right now?)

Very true. That said, besides the few we need to keep in Blighty and the 4 in Falklands - if you're going to have 'em they may as well be on a carrier. The UK, in it's current ""lets hope no-one attacks us this decade"" defence posture has 216 fighter aircraft, this will rise to 296 over the next few years as the Eurofighter delivery is completed. Once F-35 arrives that number *should* increase as it's replacing both Tornado and Harriers, which have already been axed. The government'll fuck it all up somehow though.

Frankly, I see nothing wrong with having two air wings of 80 aircraft and a land based RAF with approximately 130-150 fighters. Given our current military commitments and the various likely needs for our military, I've got no problem with RAF essentially doing interception and all the boring transport AWACS etc. and everything else being handled by carrier based forces. Certainly would have been a lot better in Libya, where, essentially, the RAF was kind of crap until the Americans and French took out the AA.

&gt;However, there's a bigger problem with your proposal: I don't believe the US would ever lease a Nimitz-class to any other country. Wanna find out just how special our special relationship isn't? Go ahead and ask to borrow one of America's symbols of national status and power.

I'm not saying lease, I'm saying buy. The Americans are retiring their Nimitz's. Either buy old ones, or just pay for the Americans to build 'em. The entire reason we're getting two CVF's is because the yankees wanted us to get carriers useful enough to be able to essentially, in a proper big shooty boomy war, form an extra two carrier battle groups and slot in with them - augmenting their forces from 11 CBG's up to 14 (2 from us, 1 from France). The entire reason we're building these things is to have something as capable as Nimitz, so why not just get some Nimitz's?

In terms of what we can afford, we're spending more than the cost of two Nimitz class carriers for two carriers which, knowing us, will probably break a lot, can't go very far, have bugger all in the terms of proper defences, and can only carry half as many birds.",0,1334848872,null,0,true,0,c4e5szj,t3_sfwbe,t1_c4e5szj,t1_c4e5gd9,null,1428754235,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If that were so, he would have had to have immense self-control over his mind. 

And this leads on to the second reason. If indeed he did have such self-control and presence of mind, why did he attempt to deploy his parachute? And why then go for the reserve?

I know that there may well be answers to these questions, such as maybe he had a change of heart at the end, but the general consensus, both by the people closest to him, and by fellow jumpers, was that he was murdered.

Thirdly, I played Connect 4 with him the night before and he seemed in pretty high spirits. I mean, he did lose that game but it didn't seem to get to him...

The police were hugely incompetent - they spent ages on the dropzone and we got to know them quite well. They were a complete bunch of idiots - reminded me of Operation Good Guys.

There was as loud and extended applause for the question as any other that night and Dimbleby awkwardly shuffled, muttered something under his breath I couldn't make out even listening to it afterwards, before Starkey made some wonderfully insightful quip about how fighter planes aren't dropping bombs on protesters in London. Aaaaaaand next question please. 

I wouldn't mind but I had to listen to Dimbleby harp on for over 40 minutes about how the audience is totally in charge, how he wants tough questions and to test the panelists, how he didn't want to be a barrier between the audience and the panel but instead to make sure our questions were all answered. Total BS.

true,Caddy666,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"Football will be banned to stop hooliganism, for a short period - say 10 years so the next generation will disassociate hooliganism with it.

instead of sportsmen and gobshites from tv. teachers, scientists, doctors, nurses, the police, firemen and entrepreneurs will be the focus of the media hype. 

hooliganism will be turned into gladiator matches, but with foam toys for safety.

Only gay men will be allowed to play rugby - therefore touching other men on a field will gain the same kind of 'stigma' as anywhere else....but moreover, the other way around....become more accepting of gays in society.

TV will drop any shitty reality TV programs like x factor and big brother. all contestants, past and present will be deported, and the hosts will be executed for treason, publicly.

eliminate the record industry - instead have a national record studio on a pay per use basis, like a practice session - therefore anyone involved in that specific record will get rich, not the music industry itself. 

buskers must have a number of headphones for anyone who wants to hear them play - therefore if they play generic depressing songs like oasis in the street, you don't have to hear it, but no-one is inconvenienced if they want to hear. 

anyone who harasses you in the street for something, or knocks on your door trying to sell you something, example charity cunts, or Mormons, can be deported. 

religion will be banned outside of the home. private personal 'temples' are allowed, but preaching to other people is punishable by death. 

anyone under 25 will not be allowed to practice, or come into contact with any religions until this age - this should guarantee that they can at least look at it objectively, and no-one will feel they were indoctrinated as a child.  all current churches/mosques/etc. will be turned into public libraries and internet centres or schools.

Anyone who is unemployed will spend one day a week litter picking, and 'park keeping*' to make everywhere nice and respectable. these people wont be treated as unemployed that day, but should be treated with the utmost respect. this should make them want to work. 

GCSEs should be given at 14, A levels at 16 and degree by 18. then 2 years national service,  4 if they fail a levels.

true,blacksheep998,tardis,TARDIS,"&gt; Matt Smith has a bigger head than David Tennant

Matt Smith hadn't been picked yet to be the next doctor, so I'm pretty sure this is just coincidence.

&gt; River's suit looks like an astronaut when she first shows up.

Could have been intentional, as Steven Moffat does tend to write stories much further ahead than most writers. If I had to guess though I'd say that [spoiler](/s ""putting her in the space suit in season 6 was a reference back to her outfit in the library, rather than her outfit in the library being any kind of foreshadowing."")

&gt; River reacts with sadness when she realizes who Donna Noble is.

This absolutely was intentional. The season 4 ending was already written when they did this episode, and especially in the RTD seasons they loved peppering little hints about the finale through the whole season.

&gt; River does not react to seeing a different regeneration of the doctor, as if she's seen this version (or different versions) of him before.

I forget where but river says something about having pictures of all his regenerations, but not knowing what order they go in. She also says that this is the youngest she's ever met him.

There's also a hint in one of the season 6 extras that [spoiler](/s ""the last time river meets the doctor before the library it's still Matt Smith. Of course with how they meet out of order that doesn't rule out that she interacts with his future regenerations as well."")",0,1334854337,null,0,false,0,c4e6ze7,t3_shybt,t1_c4e6ze7,t3_shybt,null,1435720068,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"I like your optimism. I think a few years ago people would have been assembling a first XI featuring our prospects and expecting them to be regulars by now. To be honest, out of that team you have some great potential. Mata is someone I think will only get better as he gets stronger and adapts to the league, Romeu looks a special talent and is good enough to play regularly already, Mikel is infinitely better than the guy who got caught in possession against Liverpool and Courtois is looking solid in La Liga. More importantly, Courtois understands the importance of experience and has already said after another season with Atletico, he'd like 1 or 2 seasons with a team in the Premiership to adapt to England and be ready to play for Chelsea. I massively respect how he understands his career progression and all signs are he will be our number 1 when Cech stands down (luckily not for some time yet)

Bertrand looks alright but he needs much more game time to develop. I don't want him to go on loan, I think that like Romeu he should be used against weaker opposition and get 20-25 games next season

De Bruyne is tearing it up in Belgium but this is a huge step up. I think he'll spend the first season adjusting and the similar number of games as Romeu and Bertrand would help him develop without putting too much pressure on him to perform

Let's not forget Lukaku. Not that I know the back story but he hasn't featured for an age. Give him some time when we're winning so he has a chance to lead the line with no pressure and if he does well, start him

I want to see more youth promotion and game time for our promising players. If the game is won and we're comfortable there is no reason not to give 20 or so minutes to the likes of Chalaboah, Lukaku, Piazon etc. Once Chelsea get their s**t together next season, we should be dominating teams regularly at the Bridge, perfect environment in which to play youngsters",0,1334857182,null,0,false,0,c4e7m27,t3_shqst,t1_c4e7m27,t1_c4e7cga,null,1428755087,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"*Prepares to lose all the Karma*

The biggest problem you have, when dealing with people who are substance dependent - be it drugs, alcohol etc, etc, is that if they're not interested in breaking those addictions, it won't happen. You can throw thousands of pounds worth of resources at them, and it'll get pissed down a wall.

But those who *do* want to change - who want to break their addiction and move on with their lives? The systems we've got in place can make it almost impossible **especially** if you're from a poorer background.

I'm not saying *everyone* from deprived socioeconomic backgrounds will go onto offend, nor that all those who do will face the following problems, but it's something that comes up time and time again.

The following seems to apply to a large number of people:

* Be convicted [after many ""second chances"" or ""Final Chances] and sent to prison. Typically these sentences are too short for ""in house"" substance abuse teams to do anything - their resources are directed at long-term offenders &amp; or people with longer sentences, as there's a longer time frame to attempt to affect a positive change with that person. So effectively, prison is a waste of time for those with ""smaller"" problems.
* They're then released, typically into probation hostels. Probation hostels aren't nice places, by any stretch of the imagination. Indeed I've spoken to ex-offenders who preferred prison to the hostel they'd been released into. 

Most offenders are released into hostels that are somewhat near to where they lived before. Some are released into hostels miles away. For someone likely still hooked on whatever substance got them into jail in the first place? Both scenarios are a nightmare, from a rehabilitation POV. If they're released into a hostel near to where they lived before? And they're getting cravings? [Because have no doubt about it, drugs are easy to get in prison.] They'll just head off to their old dealer and get more.

And those that are released into the custody of hostels miles away from their home / friends &amp; family? You immediately run into the problem of no support network. Support networks are vital when it comes to substance abusers - both positively and [unfortunately] negatively.

Whilst in these hostels the long journey starts to get the person back into a meaningful life - getting them onto welfare benefits [with the hope they'll progress into work - more on that later.] establishing the contact with the Probation Service to get them a probation officer, booking them onto rehabilitation programmes / ""Detox"" programmes, sorting out housing. Which brings about the next set of problems.

* It's not as easy as papers like the Daily Mail would have you think, for substance depended people to sign-on. I've had to walk many a person through the process- be it ""basic"" things like figuring out their National Insurance number, actually completing the forms etc, etc, to more complex issues - specifically if they're actually fit to ""sign-on"" in the first place. To claim JSA you have to be deemed fit, capable of looking for work, and actively doing so. If you're trying to kick a substance problem, sometimes convincing the DWP these people meet this criteria can be quite difficult.
* Housing. As I mentioned previously, probation hostels aren't nice place. They're necessary, for a number of reasons, not least of all monitoring and the building of daily routines, but they're not long term solutions. Eventually you have to get the person into housing. And again, despite what various newspapers might have you believe, not all ""junkies"" get three bedroom council flats within a day of being released from prison. From previous experience with clients, it can take as long as nine months to a year. And again, navigating them through the process to actually get the offer of a council property is pretty complicated, even if they're of the mental capacity to do it themselves.
* The **big** problem - the length of time it can take to refer a client onto the rehabilitation programmes. It's not uncommon for it to take as long as six months [indeed, I've known it take **ten months** in one case.] from when a person is released back into the community, before they're given a place on a programme. Six months is a bloody long time, if you're dealing with someone who needs that help immediately.

Etc, etc. I could write about it - and more to the point - rant about the difficulties, for hours, but this isn't perhaps the appropriate forum.

But to address some of the points raised by the OP:

**Abuse of the Methadone programme:** Methadone, or similar drugs, are prescribed in an attempt to break that persons dependence of heroin, and eventually get them ""Clean"". Unfortunately Methadone is far from perfect - and again, depending on the willingness of the abuser, can actually exasperate the problem, as the dependence factor can increase.

As for a substance dependant person who has been arrested? Yes, it's true that they'll be given Methadone whilst in custody, in certain situations. It's at the behest of an onsite /on call doctor, if applicable after checking that persons medical records. Whilst it might seem fucked up to do this, it's done for the safety of both the individual, and the people who're responsible for that person, whilst they're in custody.

With regards testing - it depends on the conditions of their release / sentencing, what their case worker / probation officer deems appropriate etc, etc. But - annoyingly is has to be said - what the OP describes isn't that uncommon. On spot random drug testing is what's needed. Not to ""catch people out"", but as part of their rehabilitation.

What's worse - an active user attempting to flush their system so they can pass the piss-test, then going straight back on it, or someone who holds their hands up and admits the problem?

Like I say I could go on for hours - don't get me started on the issue of trying to convince potential employers that ""Johnny Smackhead"" is a decent and viable candidate for a job, in an age of ever increasing Enhanced CRB checks, but this is hardly the appropriate forum.

TL:DR: As someone who has worked with ex-offenders, including those with substance abuse problems? It's a complicated issue.

true,darkotter,null,null,"Well, I am definitely not an expert in night life, but my best guess of why this is is as follows. In term time, Cambridge is full of students, and accordingly the clubs are full of students. Then, outside of term-time, with the student population much smaller, the clubs don't open on many nights, and those that are open tend to be dominated by the people who actually live in Cambridge. And they tend to be very unfriendly to students (possibly because we pretty much overrun the city the rest of the year). So, there are clubs that you can go to during the summer, but they tend to be full of unfriendly people, which is not something I have ever enjoyed when it comes to night-life. But then, I have only been to a few clubs a few times in the summer, so I may have just been unlucky. As nybor pointed out, staying at university outside of term-time is much less common in the UK.

Apart from clubs, the bars and restaurants will all be open as usual, and probably full of tourists (that is a point, do be prepared to fight your way past waves of tourists while walking down the street) most of the time, but as far as I'm aware very few people here use bars or restaurants to meet people, it seems to be generally something to do with people you've already met.

My only overall opinion about summer students from abroad is that they seem to keep themselves to themselves - last summer at least, I saw huge numbers of them around but met a vanishingly small number of them. We did have a group in our college of what I would call 'American Teenage Yuppies' who were _exceedingly_ rude, but I think that is an isolated case.

Personally I feel that in several key moments Series Six just slipped.

I feel that the Silence weren't properly explained both in motive and in form in a way [Day of the Moon SPOILERS:](/s ""where you could really root for the Doctor turning all of humanity into his own personal genociders"").

Key figures like [Series Six SPOILER:](/s ""Mme. Kavorkian"") were bandied about like major villains, but barely explored to the point where [Series Six SPOILER:](/s ""she's just ""that evil one with the eyepatch that makes the plot go"""").

River's explanation reads out like a bad soap opera. [A Good Man Goes to War and Let's Kill Hitler SPOILERS:](/s ""She's the long-lost Time Lord daughter of Amy and Rory who also lived as their best friend (who was totally there the whole time, she just doesn't do weddings. Trust us, this is all planned) and is hypnotized to kill the Doctor."")

The finale was just a rehash of the last finale [The Wedding of River Song SPOILERS:](/s ""(Oh, has time gone all wibbly resulting in a bizarre and malformed universe that only the Doctor, Amy, and River notice and must save before the universe tears itself to sheds? *Again?*)"") and felt like it was trying to jamb in as much ""Wow! Plot!"" moments as it could [The Wedding of River Song SPOILERS:](/s ""(see the hurried and random shotgun marriage for River Song)"").

And while this series does have it's gems, it's the boggy mythology that the show is forcing that dampens most every episode and makes the series as a whole difficult to enjoy.

If you're not used to sleeping in a sleeping bag it can be hard to get to sleep - unless you're planning on hiking or sleeping out in Autumn/Winter I'd recommend against a tapered ""mummy"" style bag. You can get ones that zip together in a pair. You might also find using an opened out sleeping bag and a winter duvet to be pretty cosy and comfortable; again, if you have the space for the duvet.

A futon mat is a good double for sleeping mats if you've got space to transport it.

We use sleeping bag liners; they're like a stretchy fleece. You can use them by themselves when it's warm. Or double up with that and sleeping bag when it's cold.

A good wool blanket is great to wrap around yourself when you're sitting out around a campfire and useful to have on hand to pull over if you wake cold in the night.

Don't forget to put your pants and socks for the next day in the bottom of your sleeping bag so they're toasty in the morning (if you can find them!).",0,1334867952,null,0,false,0,c4ea2oh,t3_shrut,t1_c4ea2oh,t1_c4e5mo7,null,1428756247,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Anyway, anecdotal evidence aside these tickets are only available to members, similar to how the game at the Bridge was members only. You can buy official tickets from Viagogo and a couple of other sites, all others are unofficial. Viagogo are gouging scum and you'll pay no less than $400 per ticket for some of the worst seats in Europe.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"I disagree.

All of Series Five's two-parters just dropped the ball in a big way. The Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone not only tears apart the original mythos of the Angels (now they can look at each other and can easily be fooled by someone poorly pretending to see and can move while the camera's watching them) but makes the mistake of losing its focus. What began as an intense thriller with the Angels quickly fell apart into a mess explaining the cracks and setting up for the Pandorica. 

The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood similarly falls flat on it's face as character actions are all over the place and at times absolutely incomprehensible, with many major decisions made solely to shove along the plot. And worst of all the pacing of the two parter's second half is *brutally murdered* as they decide to give Rory a *looooong* and drawn-out goodbye.

And its final two-parter (although sparkling with some brilliant bits) was an absolute incomprehensible mess that managed to explain *nothing* and not even come close to resolving the plot's many, many questions. I elaborate more on it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/rq0xj/indepth_discussion_of_the_pandorica_opensthe_big/).

And beyond this I think it is arguable to say that *all* of RTD's series do not surmount higher than Series Six.

I agree with most of your points and would like to throw in a few more of mine as well. 

While De Bruyne and Lukaku have been immense in Belgium, I'm not too sure how well they can cope with the physicality of the PL. Lukaku is built like a Tank and yet we saw him puffing and panting at min 75 during the Carling Cup loss to Liverpool. He's tearing up the reserves, yeah, but I wonder if he'll soon be overshadowed by Piazon and Feruz, not to forget Davila. Dr Bruyne seems a tad bit more shrewd - he's stated that he would be okay with a season long loan to an English side. He knows that the Jupiler League and the PL are two very different leagues. I suspect we may have found a gem in him. Needs lots of polishing with his public presentation, I feel. 

The problem, if I see correctly, is not 5 years down the line - it is about what we can do over the next year or two. JT, Lamps and Dido may have another year or two left in them but we shouldn't rely on them as much as we are doing now. We MUST find/blood suitable replacements, possibly asap. I'm sorry to say this but our current lot of 'youngsters' isn't ready - they are too green or too inexperienced or too young to 'fit right in'. In fact, dare I say, we have left the blooding process on the backburner for too long - I just hope it isn't too late. Like it or not, Champs League qualification looks difficult next season, unless we drop another chunk of cash in the market - something I'd rather NOT see happen. In fact, I'd be perfectly happy if we ended up playing Europa as long as it meant regular playing time for the young-uns. 

It also happens to be another reason why I'm not too sure of RDM for next year. Sure, he's done well with the same team that AVB had but I wonder how much of it was tactical supremacy and how much was man-management and how much was player rebellion. Credit where it is due - he has handled the rotations well but how adept is he at forging a new team? The only youngster who has had any chance at first-team time has been Bertrand and that too, out of desperation. If Drogba stays next year (unlikely, I realize), Lukaku will be wasted. If he doesn't, we'll need to play to Torres strengths - that means Lamps, Kalou, Malouda and Sturridge get fringe roles. (I'm just happy I don't have to deal with this problem, tbh.) 

In summary, I am nervous and excited to see how the next two years pan out for the club - they will determine everything about the club for the next ten years to come.

How can you conjugate a verb 1.7 million ways???

I did some googling. I think I like synthetic languages. French drives me crazy though because it's not as structured or consistent in its grammar (or exceptions in its grammar!) as German. An analytical one sounds a pain to learn...

As for inflecting languages...I think I'd like that. I like languages with consistent grammar, but complexity would be fine. Does Spanish inflect? Because its verb indicates what an English pronoun would do for us?

So how would a temporal case work?

EDIT: All this is making my head hurt (in a great way). With all these options, how can I create a language? It just became much more harder to choose.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"I like how Ramires has shown he can adapt to new positions this season. His tireless running makes him one of the most important players at the club. The position he's currently occupying, wide right/RW, is the most important position we have to strengthen. A total lack of wingers has been our downfall in a lot of games, I would expect at least 1, probably 2 wide men to come in. The natural right winger would take that position forcing Rami out. However, he can play in various positions in different systems

In a 4-2-3-1 he can play the holding role, launching attacks with his pace and doing those late runs in to the box that Frank was famous for but no longer has the legs for

In a 4-3-3 he can operate as a more balanced midfielder as the wide men move more central and operate as 3 forwards as opposed to 1 striker and 2 wingers. This would probably suit him more as I think he's more comfortable going forwards than back

Either way, he can also play as the right or left attacking player should we need him. Similarly to Gallas, being so versatile can be a gift and a curse but I think Rami has the right attitude and will appreciate his importance to the team, not bitch about being played out of his favoured position. Signing him to a new 5 year deal has been one of the best achievements of the season

Summary: With reinforcements coming in, Rami will become a versatile player who fits in different positions, an injury to him would be less damaging than it would be now since there would be specialist players in positions occupied by him this season",0,1334870325,null,0,false,0,c4eamnw,t3_shqst,t1_c4eamnw,t1_c4eai22,null,1428756508,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Every single episode, I kept noticing how Matt's acting was getting better and better, and he was by no means a bad actor to begin with.

However, in retrospect, the season becomes much weaker. What seemed like some sort of unified arc before everything was revealed (though perhaps that was shaped by how much I wanted to perceive it as such) turned into a string of extremely loosely-connected episodes out of which only a few are truly important. There were a lot of threads left loose at the end of the series that I highly doubt will be revisited.

By playing a couple of younger ones each game, they can develop and play freely knowing their contribution isn't vital to success. Lukaku would come on in games already won, seeing as how his position as a lone striker must be earned first

You're right in saying a younger player would always have more passion. A game against Wigan might be routine for many but for that young lad, it's his big chance. You get some stellar performances from young players in games like that and it has a profound effect on those around him, plus a massive confidence boost for the kid himself.

If you have severe pain that's come on over time or you have sharp pain that has come on quickly and you've no one with you (eg to drive you to hospital) then yes, as a trained first-aider (but only FAW and various life-saving certs in the past), I'd have to say call for an ambulance.

If you genuinely don't think it's an emergency warranting an ambulance and your clinic is shut then call NHS direct for advice.

If it's worse than needing reassurance from a medic on NHS direct and not severe enough, in your layman opinion, to warrant immediate emergency care then I'd recommend attempting to get a house-call (this can be hard!) or probably easier turning up at A&amp;E.

A&amp;E will perform triage on you. The medic in triage will be able to make a swift assessment as to whether you're dying tonight or not. Often if it's not something too critical you'll be left in an uncomfortable waiting room writhing in pain for 4-5 hours; then you should get to see a doctor.

Mention all symptoms and don't try to downplay anything that's bothering you.

Can you provide a rational explanation for the pain - like you just finished a marathon, or you've eaten a years supply of wagon wheels in 2 days, or been in a drunken brawl, or something? 

Chest pain (heavy, tight or crushing pain) + pain in neck/back/arms/lower jaw =&gt; heart attack. Call an ambulance.

I've watched House a couple of times though so ... age, sex, weight, general health condition, skin feel, stool condition, describe your pain, how quickly it came on ... my money's on pancreatitis.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"The people you're describing probably have a mixed bag of problems - alcoholism, mental health issues, drug dependency, homelessness, etc. - and, in most cases, pretty horrific biographies.  In all honesty, many of the dependent heroin users I've known, particularly those who were in treatment, stable and without other major issues, were pretty much indistinguishable from Joe public in terms of how they looked (though their arrest records were usually more colourful - mostly with petty thieving).  Throw chaotic use, alcohol and mental illness into the mix though and things go south rapidly.  

I understand completely how difficult such people can be, and that's why I respect and admire both those who have to deal with the problems they can cause and those who try to help them.  But my point about compassion still stands - most people don't become problematically dependent on drugs, even the more sticky ones, without some serious background issues.  There's a reason many of these people end up with alcohol and heroin and downers as their drugs of choice, often something in their past is too painful to handle and they're trying to obliterate it and kill the pain.  It's hard to respond humanely to the people you see before you causing mayhem, try to think of the people they were, and some lucky ones may become again with the right help.

Edit:  Of course, some people were just inconsiderate jerks before they took their first drug!  And, in terms of a lot of criminality, that's usually the case.  Drug dependency doesn't often turn decent law-abiding people into vicious criminals.  It generally amplifies the frequency and seriousness of prior offending patterns.  If you were shoplifting before, maybe you're burgling now; if you were doing the odd burglary before, maybe you're breaking into warehouses a couple of times a week now, etc. ",0,1334871514,null,0,true,0,c4eaw8m,t3_si6p7,t1_c4eaw8m,t1_c4e9g06,null,1428756634,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,[deleted],null,null,"Why would you be angered if you had a kid who was interested in politics, or any news anyway? 

If you get angry that your child forms a 'light', right wing opinion on certain issues, what would be wrong with that? Why would you not look at it in the same way as if your kid was forming a 'light' left wing opinion on the same issues? 

Let's look at ourselves and our position within the EU, for example;

A basic left wing argument would be that as technological advancements rise, so will the quality of living internationally, up to a certain point where the quality of life is pretty much equalised the world over. Because of this, immigration will cease to be a problem within the next generation or two anyway, why not open our borders to Eastern Europe, so that we may integrate sooner rather than later?

A right wing view about immigration would be that because Polish people live 5 men to a house and come over on their own, they can afford to send money back home to their families (where it buys more things) and because they don't have families here, can afford to undercut local tradesmen. 

Personally, I believe we should look at this issue (and every issue) somewhere in the middle. Having a bias against left or right as a 'moral' political standpoint means you're not looking at whatever issues it is through clear eyes. 

If your son agrees with the daily mail on certain issues, explain the opposite and let him choose from a less bias view. Do the same thing with the guardian too though. 

It's like if your son wants to become a boxer. You shouldn't say 'thats silly lad, be a doctor or engineer instead!', you get behind him and his choice 100% and push him to be the best in the world. If your son makes an educated decision about a political issue, instead of firing it on or trying to change it, you should leave it be... helping to encourage his own personal development and thought processes. 

Trying to inject a political agenda into a child is as bad as bringing them up religious and teaching creationism to them in schools... it blurs their vision of reality. ",0,1334872666,null,0,false,0,c4eb5dj,t3_she27,t1_c4eb5dj,t1_c4e1qxt,null,1428756753,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,mediciscredittoheavy,null,null,"tl;dr I don't like CCEA. So yes, we would probably be better off moving to AQA/OCR/Edexcel.

I'm just gonna through in my two cents in a little depth on it (to a fellow sufferer) although I will say that I am blaming them a lot and I don't really know all the facts about it:

There are a lot of angles I've heard for and against. I know a few teachers have taught AQA at A-Level (although I'm quoting from a biology teacher, not a chemistry teacher) and they praised the structure of the exam. They said AQA started off with the 'simpler' topics and worked its way into the more complex topics (I figured a progression of Ecology to Biochemistry). I've noticed this with Edexcel in Maths, for example, initiating an exam with a binomial expansion progressing to a question on first order differential equations, which people tend to find harder. CCEA on the other hand just wings it at you and lets you get on with it. I've heard this as a complaint about CCEA Maths as well.

Chemistry on CCEA is also unique for the board in the sense that it has multiple choice at the start of the exam. I see this somewhat as good and bad. Good thing is, two easy marks for good questions and of course the opposite, two measly marks for a difficult question. I dislike this because it's not proportional to the difficulty of the question (then again, are they ever really proportional at A-Level?).

Scaling is a large factor too, apparently. CCEA Chemistry scaling has been described to me as a system where ""the rich get richer and the poor get poorer"". They really are atrocious for this, I don't know how scaling works on a mathematical level, but people drop down grades because of the scaling (say from 50% to 40%, while some people go from 80% to 90%). I admit they can't let everyone have all the high grades because of grade inflation although I don't know enough to really critique how the system works.

And just in a little addition to scaling, on an English board, students compete against English students so there's a much larger pool of students to compete with. However, the results may work out the same in the end.

The new specification is a pain. The first two exams for each module are pretty much the same, roughly the same format, topics and difficulty. Then when they reach the third or fourth exam they just flip that around. Of course, this shouldn't really matter, because after all everyone should be learning a specification and not an exam. But for those who learn through practice, it is a bit of a spanner in the works.

As for the CCEA specification, if I recall correctly E-Z isomerism was introduced pretty quietly (or not at all) and it appeared on a paper. Our school didn't have comprehensive notes on polyunsaturated fats in the diet. So when linoleic and linolic acid appeared, a lot of us were oblivious to the fact that they were the essential omega 3 &amp; 6 fatty acids. 

In the end I say all this, and I've never taken a series of English board Chemistry exams, so for all I know it could be very similar. But to be honest, being told to draw Archadionic acid on the exam was some kind of joke. Methody in Belfast use OCR for Chemistry but because of CCEA I'm not sure. CCEA may also be cheaper for schools in Northern Ireland (I'm basing this off the cost of resits and remarks in comparison for that of OCR/AQA/Edexcel).

A few schools usually do complain to CCEA over the Chemistry A-Level exams.

Very little room for horror here, although you could argue that Hartnell's Doctor was a bit scary and intimidated himself.

Some random 'scary' moments I can think of:

- In my opinion, there's a general unsettling weirdness about the whole of McCoy's last season. The stories deal with ancient and fundamental powers, the Doctor barely explains anything yet always seems to know what's going on, and he's preparing Ace for some greater destiny.

From what I've read they announced that fairly quickly. They *bought* them for a price that was aimed at spare parts birds.

I also appreciate how difficult it must be to come up with a strategy that counterbalances all of the advantages of that beautiful style of play by the best team in the world...  because that's exactly what happened yesterday.  It wasn't a simple ""ok, everybody defend!"", there was a lot of preparation put into this - everybody on the team was on the same page.

The counter-attack that lead to the goal was near perfect in execution too..

The growth in population is projected to continue[8] with an extra 14,000 homes expected from 2001 to 2026.[9]
At the 2001 census, there were 94,024 citizens in the district. Of all districts in Lincolnshire, it contains the highest proportion of married people and the least number of divorced people.

We have a number of Museums in the City including the recently opened Museum of Liverpool Life, The Liverpool Museum a general Museum with some great stuff inside including Mummies, Dinosaur skeletons, space. And there is the Walker Art Gallery next to it.

Many theatres. The Empire is our biggest and often puts on bit shows and Opera. The Playhouse which is the oldest theatre of it's kind and the Everyman which is currently closed for refurbishment.

We have two fantastic Cathedrals. The Anglican and Metropolitan which we affectionately call Paddy's Wigwam. Both are great to visit. The Anglican for it's many wonderful alcoves to go and explore and it boasts the largest inside space in Europe (possibly the world) and Paddy's Wigwam is great to visit especially on a sunny day for the colours that shine through it's windows are incredible.

St George's Hall is another wonderful building to visit.

My gut feeling for which I admit I have no data is that it wouldn't lead to a situation as beneficial as the proponents of legalisation would have us believe. I don't have much of a problem with legalising cannabis but would be concerned if harder drugs were legal.

I think one of the big hurdles the pro-legalising campaign must overcome is the public perception of cannabis users.

""Cyber attacks on IT systems would become a criminal offence punishable by at least two years in prison throughout the EU under a draft law backed by the Civil Liberties Committee on Tuesday. Possessing or distributing hacking software and tools would also be an offence, and companies would be liable for cyber attacks committed for their benefit.

The proposal, which would update existing EU legislation on cyber attacks, was approved with by 50 votes in favour, 1 against and 3 abstentions.

""We are dealing here with serious criminal attacks, some of which are even conducted by criminal organisations. The financial damage caused for companies, private users and the public side amounts to several billions each year"" said rapporteur Monika Hohlmeier (EPP, DE). ""No car manufacturer may send a car without a seatbelt into the streets. And if this happens, the company will be held liable for any damage. These rules must also apply in the virtual world"" she added.

The proposal would establish harmonised penal sanctions against perpetrators of cyber attacks against an information system - for instance a network, database or website. Illegal access, interference or interception of data should be treated as a criminal offence, MEPs say.

The maximum penalty to be imposed by Member States for these offences would be at least two years' imprisonment, and at least five years where there are aggravating circumstances such as the use of a tool specifically designed to for large-scale (e.g. ""botnet"") attacks, or attacks cause considerable damage (e.g. by disrupting system service), financial costs or loss of financial data. 

IP spoofing

Using another person's electronic identity (e.g. by ""spoofing"" their IP address), to commit an attack, and causing prejudice to the rightful identity owner would also be an aggravating circumstance - for which MEPs say Member States must set a maximum penalty of at least three years.

MEPs also propose tougher penalties if the attack is committed by a criminal organisation and/or if it targets critical infrastructure such as the IT systems of power plants or transport networks.

However, no criminal sanctions should apply to ""minor cases"", i.e. when the damage caused by the offence is insignificant.

Cyber-attack tools

The proposal also targets tools used to commit offences: the production or sale of devices such as computer programs designed for cyber-attacks, or which find a computer password by which an information system can be accessed, would constitute criminal offences.

Liability of legal persons

Legal persons would be liable for offences committed for their benefit (e.g. a company would be liable for hiring a hacker to get access to a competitor's database), whether deliberately or through a lack of supervision. They would also face penalties such as exclusion for entitlement to public benefits or judicial winding-up.

To resist cross-border cyber-attacks, Member States need to ensure that their networks of national contact points are available round the clock, and can respond to urgent requests within a maximum of eight hours, says the text.

Background

Large-scale cyber-attacks took place in Estonia in 2007 and Lithuania in 2008. In March 2009, public and private sector IT systems in more than 103 countries were attacked using a ""zombie"" network of compromised, infected computers.

Next steps

The Rapporteur aims for a political agreement between Parliament and Council on this Directive by the summer.""

I don't give a monkeys what sexuality someone has neither do I care about what Pipa gets upto on her holiday but I can understand how this is celebrity gossip that people are interested in. People are interested in Jessie J's Sexuality in the same way people are interested in Peter Andre's sex life. Also The Sun describe everything as explosive or shocking or exclusive when it can be neither.

Everyone reports on celebrity gossip as news. Guardian, BBC all of them. They also editorialise. Emphasising the few Brits that died over the thousands of foreigners. Reporting on sport results over deaths. I just don't see what your suggesting that wouldn't infringe free press. The Sun are doing what they're doing to maximise profits and it works.

Indecently, [couldn't find missile test](http://www.frontpagestoday.co.uk/2012/04/19/archive.cfm). Are they all immoral? The Express is reporting on the sodding weather!

As for phone tapping. I do not understand why people would boycott the NOTW but *not* the sun so I'd agree with that statement.

Edit: The fact is that most people who read The Sun or The Star don't care about stories that don't either directly affect them or involve someone on TV. My brother reads The Sun.

Nutrients, high intensity lighting, hydroponic irrigation, air conditioning, control of the sex of every single plant or the whole crop becomes useless. 

Since we live in the UK the high intensity lighting can't come from the sun so electric lights must be used which drives up the cost. 

It scales quite well, though. The bigger your setup the cheaper the weed is to produce (Although it'll still be a lot more expensive than tobacco). 

Professionals in a huge warehouse could probably get the price right down.

The average criminal grower at the moment just converts a rented house into a grow op and gets crappy ROI as a result. That's half the reason weed is so expensive, and the other half is because it's illegal.

The issue is that anything-goes-as-long-as-it-sells is a concept that was unacceptible twenty years ago, but it's had to reach the point of the Levenson Enquiry for anything to be done about it; if you're on dodgy moral ground already (and fully aware of it), it's easier to go that bit further (which they did).

Tapping - yeah, I've never understood why people seperate NOTW and The Sun either; it doesn't help that friends who read it appear to assume that their purchase has no effect (like your brother) - and so because of this attitude, when I post stuff like this to FB it's usually along with a statement such as ""See this?

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"Indeed - I'm not suggesting that it's *you* stating 'anything goes', more The Sun doing so (as they have, time and again), which is why allowing them to print what they want on the front page has to stop. 

Just as the banks proved that allowing them to regulate themselves doesn't work, the tabloids have proved they can't do it either. Witness the number of times the Daily Mail has printed pap photos after promising post-Diana that they'd never stoop so low again. The Sun is even worse, starting drives against spousal abuse that suddenly end when the editor is arrested for attacking her husband, or anti-pedophile weeks (where pediatricians' offices got torched); in short, there's more than enough evidence to show that they are quite happily amoral if it means selling more copy, which is what has to stop. Piers Moron is a great example; the fact that he refuses to ackowledge *any wrongdoing at all* simply demonstrates how the brass-neck method is still in place. 

Back in the days of the Elton John nonsense, I was fairly apathetic because even back then newspaper circulation was dwindling, so in the long run, did it matter? Now it's twenty-five years later, and here we still are. Only the other week, the Daily Mail got tweeted by Alyssa Milano with something along the lines of 'my child isn't famous, didn't ask for this life and needs privacy - can you stop buying and printing pap photos, please?' which makes a mockery of the general agreement to not buy/ publish photos of the children of famous people simply because they are the children of famous people.

So, how to combat this? Instead of a stringent set of rules/ boundaries that must be abided, I'd prefer legislation that was deliberately vague, so that each case could be heard on it's merits. I'd like The Sun (in this example) to actually back up why someone being gay or not gay is 'explosive', and how it's more important than the deoprtation of Qatada. It also should be that hard to stop the pratice (for instance) of printing anything they like about someone with a proviso of 'a friend said' or 'according to insiders' unless it's about a serious subject where the source genuinely does need protection (some sort of proof that they actually exist, for example).",0,1334927694,null,0,false,0,c4ej2hl,t3_shooh,t1_c4ej2hl,t1_c4eipdg,null,1428760565,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This isn't a new idea you and your friend have created, it's an inane concept that's been cycling around for quite some time, and only someone who didn't look at the evidence or even think about the logic of it would continue to spread it.

I'm not trying to be mean, but Rory being the Master makes *absolutely no sense*, and here's why:

Rory's not been more agitated or hostile, he's just been more decicive with his actions. He's never been cruel or malicious or even short-tempered with those he loves. Even when Amy [The Girl Who Waited SPOILERS:](/s ""was trapped for thirty-six years and treated him with bitterness""), he still found empathy and love for her. He similarly shows compassion to [The Rebel Flesh SPOILERS:](/s ""the Gangers"") when even Amy wouldn't.

Secondly, Rory complains of a headache because he (like the viewing audience) is blown away by the sheer ridiculous incomprehensibility  that is [Let's Kill Hitler SPOILERS:](/s ""realizing his best friend is also his daughter, is also River Song"") and wants to cool off for a minute.

Thirdly, the alarm noise is called the Cloister Bell. It has no ties to the Master in particular and goes off *whenever* the TARDIS is on the verge of dying or is caught up in an emergency. It also has been linked to signaling the Doctor's death (as seen in Logopolis and arguably in Waters of Mars).

Fourth, Rory did not have a room in The god Complex because the point of the ""hotel"" was [The God Complex SPOILERS:](/s ""not to simply scare people or show them their fears, but to expose the raw emotional energy connecting them with what they had faith in. Rory had no faith and hence had no room""). And even if he *did* have a room, how does the Doctor's room making a specific noise have *anything* to do with Rory?

Fifth, how could Rory even *be* the Master? Amy had an entire childhood with him (Let's Kill Hitler) and the Master [End of Time SPOILERS:](/s ""is currently trapped within the Time Lock""). Similarly, what does the Master have to gain by pretending to be Rory? It's not like they'd use the [Utopia SPOILERS:](/s ""Master in human body through use of a Fob Watch"") plot *again*.

As British is the nomenclature used for someone from Great Britain, as well as someone from the UK, then describing Northern Ireland as being part of Britain makes sense when the question is regarding people (as opposed to when it concerns borders and land masses).

About half of the people in Northern Ireland consider themselves British (largely those descended from Scottish and English settlers), while the other half consider themselves Irish.

I hope this makes sense. I'm not sure any of it is relavent to the case of Dylan Moran though, seeing as he is from the Republic of Ireland, and as far as I know, considers himself Irish.

We live in Bristol, which has a fair number of cyclists on the roads. He tries to give cyclists as much room as possible when passing, but he and other motorists can't always give much room because they don't have much room themselves. If you think about a typical urban road, there will be parked cars along both sides, meaning vehicles can't use the full width of the lanes. So, in order to pass a cyclist, my fianc√© sometimes has to put his car into the lane of oncoming traffic. This means that he is often squished between oncoming traffic and the cyclist he is trying to pass, meaning he can't give the cyclist as much room. Obviously sometimes he can't pass the cyclist at all, but it often causes more problems to sit right behind a slow moving cyclist (Bristol has a lot of hills so usually cyclists are moving slowly) than to pass them. So the issue is not always with the motorist themselves, but with the simple fact that there isn't enough space for all the different types of road users on a typical urban road.

Recognising that you need professional support is a massive step. There's a lot of help out there. It's not all medical either. A good doctor should be able to point you in the direction of some peer support or self-help group if that's what you feel you need.

I'm interested to know why you are worried about 'tainting' your medical records. One in four people experiences some kind of mental health challenge in their life. It's normal. But I appeciate that there are still a lot of negative attitudes out there.

Use your NHS while it's still free! Anything you share with your doctor will be kept confidential unless you give permission to share it. You're probably more likely to feel frustrated when you try out a few different services and have to tell your story again from the start at each new place. Services are terrible at talking to one another!

I'd offer some more detailed advice but I don't have much knowledge beyond what's available in Leeds. You can probably find out a lot by Googling your city's name followed by 'mental health directory' or something. You might be able to find some places you can self refer to if you're concerned about talking to your doctor. I do think your doctor is your best first port of call though, unless you have already had a negative experience with her/him.

Let us know how you get on. :)

Psychiatrists do not usually offer 'therapy' as such, their role is mainly around diagnosing mental illness and prescribing appropriate medication. A GP can refer you to a psychiatrist if they feel it's appropriate. 

If you want counselling (talking therapy) then you can access this on the NHS through your GP. There is also a service called IAPT which provides Cognitive Behavioural Therapy on the NHS but you can self refer so you wouldn't need to see the GP. A quick internet search should tell you whether there are IAPT services in your local area but they only really deal with cases of mild/moderate anxiety or depression though so if you're dealing with anything more complex they probably won't be able to help. 

You could pay for private counselling but this is likely to cost between ¬£40-50 an hour. 

I gather from your other post that you are concerned about mental health issues being documented in your medical records. This is a common concern but please don't let it prevent you from getting the support you need. If you are concerned about your mental health I strongly advise you to see your GP, anything you tell them is confidential and you do not have to disclose mental health issues/treatment when applying for jobs etc. All mental health professionals are bound by very strict guidelines regarding confidentiality and are trained to empathise and listen without judgement.

&gt;A GOVERNMENT that can barely send an email has unveiled somewhat ambitious plans to rule the web with an iron fist.
&gt;
&gt;Bolstered by successfully bungling an imaginary fuel crisis and impressively failing to deliver a hot snack reference, the coalition feels it is ready to exert total control over an enormously complicated and abstract network of lightning-fast electronic information.
&gt;
&gt;Prime minister David Cameron, who still uses an AOL email account, said: ""The internet is just a bunch of computers connected with wire, like a slightly more elaborate version of those baked-bean-can-and-string pretend telephones we used to make as kids.
&gt;
&gt;""So spying on pretty much everything that happens on it will be a piece of piss.""
&gt;
&gt;Civil rights campaigner Nikki Hollis said: ""On the one hand, it's deeply worrying that the government is seeking to create a surveillance culture that encompasses spying on all digital media.
&gt;
&gt;""On the other, that same government would struggle to arrange a children's party if provided with a clown, a bouncy castle, some children and an unlimited supply of jelly.
&gt;
&gt;""So it's hard to say whether we should be worried or mildly amused.""

I'm guessing despot was a spelling error, but it is a brilliant one.

As for weed being haram or not, it isn't a straight forward answer. I have a limited understanding of Islam, but as far as I can tell what is considered haram or not depends on the interpretation of the Quran or Hadith given to you by the person you are asking (often an Imam or Shaykh), and there isn't a universally acceptable list of things which are considered haram. So if you google ""is &lt;word for weed&gt; haram?"" you will mostly find Muslims asking other Muslims that question, and you will see a variety of answers to this question (although the majority say it isn't).

&gt;In the past it had been ""substantially Anglo Saxon ‚Äì now 20% of our students are Muslim,"" he said.

What this seems to mean, in this particular context, is that the 'minority' of 80% have to bend over backwards to avoid offending the 'majority' of 20%. Or to put it another way, that the lifestyles of the majority have to be modified for no other reason than not offending the minority.

Perhaps the 80% of women at that university who are not muslim should be required to wear a hijab, you know, because of ""cultural sensitivity"". And the 80% of men who are not muslim should be required to wear a beard for the same reason.

Annoyance aside, what really is going on here? It is the surreptitious imposition of the religious beliefs of one group of people over another. The demand for religious acquiescence disguised as the demand for racial acceptance.

EDIT:

Just thought this was worth commenting on:

&gt;""How will we service the changing balance of our students unless we ourselves evolve?""

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; However, as the majority of people in the UK and elsewhere use the terms UK, GB and Britain interchangably, describing Northern Ireland as part of Britain is widely accepted, outwith those being pedantic for political reasons. 

I'm not sure it's really fair to say that people who don't describe NI as being a part of Britain are being ""pedantic for political reasons"". Firstly NI is physically not part of the island of Britain, but more importantly the distinction between ""GB"" and ""NI"" is even more pertinent when talking about people and politics. Anyone working in politics realises that this is a very important legal and political distinction. We're always talking about legislation from ""GB"" and how it will be modified for NI. I actually think that those who don't want to admit this, for political reasons, are being rather stubborn. 

Furthermore I would like to see a citation for the claim that most people in the UK consider NI to be a part of Britain. This isn't the finding of the majority of social attitudes surveys regarding this topic, which have found that people in Britain generally regard Northern Ireland to be a part of Ireland and not Britain. A 2005 study by the Commission for Racial Equality for example found that ""the most basic, objective and uncontroversial conception of the British people is one that includes the English, the Scots and the Welsh"".

http://ethnos.co.uk/what_is_britishness_CRE.pdf

Some people in NI feel a close social and cultural connection to Great Britain and that's fine, but the majority of people in Great Britain do not regard NI as part of GB and furthermore the distinction between GB and NI is important legally and politically. So important in fact that the UK is called ""the United Kingdom of Great Britain **and** Northern Ireland. It's not just the ""United Kingdom of Great Britain"".

true,Caldariblue,null,null,"The logic is as follows:

Lets look at a hypothetical; looking after a property store where evidence is stored. The police currently pay 5 civilians ¬£20,000 a year to do this, they also have to be insured and pay pensions and other overheads which cost an extra ¬£10000 per person a year. Staff costs are ¬£150,000 and electricity, maintenance etc is another ¬£50,000. Our hypothetical property store costs ¬£200,000 a year to run.

Group 4 come along and offer to do the storage, but they say that they can do it for ¬£150,000 a year (on a 5 year contract). Naturally the police like saving money so they jump at it.

Group 4 close the property store and move all the evidence to a big warehouse in the next town which is run by 3 guys all being paid ¬£18000 a year. This warehouse also stores evidence from the other surrounding towns, so the operating costs (electricity etc) are cheaper overall.

The police are now driving an extra 10 miles to pick up or drop off their evidence - this doesnt feature on Group 4's balance sheets so everything looks great. The fact that the lower paid staff are being treated like shit and overworked doesnt reflect badly on the police, even when one of them takes to stealing cocaine and selling it on the street.

Everyone wins. Except the 5 guys who lost their jobs, the police officers driving around instead of actually working, the victims of the guy who gets found not guilty because the evidence went up someones nose. But Group 4 make a profit and the Senior officer who came up with the idea of privatisation gets a promotion on the back of how much money he just saved.

After the 5 year contract expires, the price suddenly doubles to ¬£300,000. As the police no longer have a property store or the staff to run one, they continue to pay. A young enterprising officer creates a new procedure where a small section of the police station is used as a temporary holding store before evidence is taken to the Group 4 store on a rota basis. The police officers ""keep the wheel on"" and make up for the inefficiency of the system to the best of their abilities, the officer who came up with this idea is promoted.

Eventually someone realises that money could be saved if the police managed their own evidence store, this person is promoted based on the amount of money that they have saved.

The links at the bottom go into further detail. When a major supermarket constitutes a supplier's only customer, said supermarket  walks all over them. Arbitrarily insisting they will be having a large discount on a particular order, turning back perfectly good stock on a whim, blackballing anyone who blows the whistle are all commonplace practices.

In context, all the big supermarkets are at it. I was going to say 'in fairness' but that would be a macabre joke. The amounts they quibble over are negligible to their own galactic bottom lines but they're beggaring farmers across the country. They aren't even passing on the savings; one dairy farmer wrote about how he only got 1p per extra per litre compared to the prices Tesco paid in 1997 - it's gone up by around 38p per litre on the shelf in that timeframe. Fuck the lot of them. Greedy pigs.

""During the course of the game he did take a kick to the face, a kick to the nuts and a knee injury from landing awkwardly (which may keep him out of the 2nd leg), all were unintentional, accidental collisions.
Yes, we all know he was theatrical and spent too long on the ground, nobody can defend that. When people start describing it as the worst thing they've ever seen, either they are ignorant of a lot of what goes on in football or their statements are hyperbolic

At no time did I see him ask the ref to send somebody off, wave any imaginary cards or react violently to any challenges, all things which I would call worse offences. We've all seen players trying to get each other sent off this season, be it diving in the box or going down clutching the face and claiming an elbow/punch etc. He didn't do any of that, he wasted time as best as he could, broke up some momentum and that is all

The English papers are full of people making grand statements about how it was a disgrace to the game and the worst performance ever. You must have a pretty short memory because in the past 2 weeks alone Ashley Young has dived to win a penalty and get a man sent off, and done it again to win a penalty against his old team. Actions so offensive to the ideals of sportsmanship that even his own fans have been lambasting him in the media and their own fanzines (Red Issue, for one). As of this afternoon, a Sheffield United player has been sentenced to 5 years for raping a girl. Eboue is almost beaten by a fan on the pitch, faces monkey chants like Samba is facing in Russia. But I'm sure they are right, above and beyond all the other issues in football right now it is Didier Drogba who is the disgrace and should be the pariah against which all neutrals and those with a newfound sense of self-righteousness should direct their ire""

Addendum: A lot of my friends are big United fans. My Uncle is extremely 'in' with the club by virtue of living next to Sir Alex and being very good friends. Hell, he flies with the team for their away games in Europe. Even he cannot stand Rooney or Young, a lot of United fans can't.

true,literallyoverthemoon,null,null,"&gt; We're always talking about legislation from ""GB"" and how it will be modified for NI.

This is why I stated that *describing Northern Ireland as being part of Britain makes sense when the question is regarding people*; legislation and law obviously require differentiation in nomenclature, just as they do in Scotland, for example.

I never said that most people consider NI to be a part of Britain. I said that the terms GB and UK are widely used interchangably, and with NI being part of the UK, it follows that NI is thought of when the national/political entity in which we live (whatever we choose to call it in a given context) is considered. 

There are technical reasons for the importance of the distinction, as you have suggested, but my point was that with respect to people on the street and what they choose to call themselves, the exclusion of NI from 'Great Britain' is pretty meaningless. 

For those who consider themselves British, they come from the country they know as Britain, Great Britain, or the United Kingdom. No one in the history of Northern Ireland has ever told someone while on holiday that they hail from the *United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland*.

The rest of the UK considering NI to simply be part of Ireland and not Britain could be seen as a lack of History and Geography teaching, or at least due to lazy media reporting, such is the seemingly ignored complexity of the Ireland/NI/UK relationship (I once had a geography teacher who shrugged off a question about NI, because the answer was 'too complicated'. I went to school in Scotland, where most people learn about Northern Ireland through songs at football games. In England, I doubt NI is mentioned anywhere outwith news stories about the Troubles; little wonder they do not feel a connection to the people of NI, how could you when you know nothing else about them?). One could even go so far as to say that what the rest of the UK thinks of NI is irrelevant; if a part of the UK believes it is British, then it is.

This of course ignores the question of what proportion of NI considers itself British, which is covered in other discussions and articles. My initial point was that, to an Ulsterman, the much venn-diagrammed complexities of national and political nomenclature are pretty meaningless, and he will call himself whatever he wishes to be called, and say he comes from wherever he believes he comes from.

But there is evidence that he also takes it to ""vacation"" places that they just don't show because nothing boring happens.

I believe it's the last episode of season 5 where there is a brief moment where they mention ""Space Florida"" (Don't worry, it's not a key part of the story or a spoiler or anything)

I think that there are other similar references but I can't recall them.

There are also a lot of situations where the Doctor drives to certain historical events (s04e02) and ""drives"" the TARDIS to follow signals of distress as well (s01e09).

It's very complicated because in s01e06, the Doctor claims that there is a signal that drew that TARDIS off course.

So I guess it's complicated and there is evidence for all of your possibilities throughout the series.

I'll stop rambling now.

Also in most urban environments where that is an issue on congested roads where you at no point can into the other lane (busy roads this isnt much of an issue it is usually waiting a few seconds at most for a gap in the oncoming traffic) actually overtaking is largely pointless as it doesnt increase speed much.

I have to agree with parrotofdoom, and  ost people are fine overtaking and I've never had an issue overtaking. it is the few that arent that are the issue. from your comment, it seems your boyfriend isnt overtaking safely/correctly, the overtaking car HAS to be in the next lane when overtaking a cyclist.

true,rablenkov,uk,Southend-on-Sea,"Many years ago, my father used to work on the Pier at Southend-on-Sea when there were amusements at the end of it. His job was to act as a 'roper', wandering around and playing a few games and invariably winning something like a huge teddy bear.  This was, apparently, achieved by the stallholders doing things like giving him the only air rifle with straight sights.

One day, while mooching around on his break, he wandered down to the lower level to have a cigarette. While looking across the water, he saw bubbles appearing on the surface and leaned forwards to try and figure out what it was. All of a sudden, a bloated, gaseous corpse shot up out of the water and then lay there, bobbing about on the tide. I'm surprised that he didn't have a heart attack there and then, or at least explosively empty his colon into his undercrackers.

Turns out that a young woman swimming just off of Canvey Island a couple of weeks earlier had gone missing. The tide had carried her body to the pier where she got caught up somewhere on the sea bed or something. Once she had sufficiently filled with gas, she tore free and shot to the surface. He told me that the crabs had made something of a buffet from her eyes and nose.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; The rest of the UK considering NI to simply be part of Ireland and not Britain could be seen as a lack of History and Geography teaching, or at least due to lazy media reporting, such is the seemingly ignored complexity of the Ireland/NI/UK relationship...

Yea, they really need to get an education and realise that the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is actually the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Great Britain.

No, Britain/Great Britain does not include Northern Ireland. Britain is an island northwest of Continental Europe. It is the ninth largest in the world. This is the official definition. It is what Britain is. Now I understand your point that for most people the terms ""Great Britain"" and the ""United Kingdom"" are interchangeable. This is for the same reason that for most people the terms ""the Republic of China"" and ""Taiwan"" are interchangeable. Great Britain dominates the UK, socially, economically and politically. It makes up 97% of the UK's population. 

Therefore because it makes sense in colloquial, everyday conversation, to use the terms ""Great Britain"" and the ""United Kingdom"" interchangeably and because NI is part of the UK, it might also seem reasonable enough to talk about NI as being a part of ""Britain"" (although it's complicated by the fact that half its population think of themselves as Irish, not British). I have no quarrel with this. This is reasonable. But for you to say that it is the people who use the term for what it actually *officially* means, that lack history and geography education - and that the people who use the informal colloquial use of the word are *really* the ones who are clued in - that just doesn't make sense.

""New Keynes"" is pretty much the nicest Undergraduate accommodation on campus, but is also the most expensive (I think).  But with that, you'll be getting a full kitchen (shared amongst I think 5 or 6 people) and a nice room.  The older Keynes blocks are also pretty good, but you only get a microwave and a small refrigerator (and a kettle) shared between about 12 people.  Parkwood can be nice as well, depending on if you're in the flats (better) or the houses (not bad, but some are kind of shabby).  Also, Parkwood is much further away from the main campus.  Eliott would be your next closest accommodation, but no one I've met who has lived there has been very keen on it.  I don't know much about what it's like on the inside though, but I think you share bathrooms there, with only a wash basin in your room.  Tyler Court is rather nice, but it's quite a bit further away from Ingram.  Rutherford is a carbon copy of Eliott and is a little bit further away as well.  Darwin is broken down into hall-style accommodation or the Darwin flats.  As someone who lived in Keynes, there is for some reason a rivalry with Darwin that prevents me from saying anything good about it, but I will say Origins Bar has pretty good food.  Your only other choice is off campus accommodation, but if you don't have anyone to live with it can be a toss up.  Also, if you live in Old Keynes, Eliott, or Rutherford, you get either a breakfast or ¬£2 off dinner at Rutherford dining hall, your choice.  I don't think any other accommodation offers that, but seriously don't let that sway your decision making, it is literally not worth it to eat their most of the time.

Firstly, the Eighth Doctor Movie takes place *before* the Time War. The Master survived that encounter, [Utopia SPOILERS:](/s ""was resurrected by the Time lords, and ran from the Time War to the end of the universe""). 

But *even then*, how would the Master being absorbed into the Eye of Harmony have *anything* to do with Rory?

They have *no* connections *whatsoever*. Rory has never actually ""died"". **EVER**. [Amy's Choice SPOILERS:](/s ""He's died in a dream, and so did Amy and the Doctor. That's not actually dying""). [The Doctor's Wife SPOILERS:](/s ""An illusion created by HOUSE showed Amy a dead Rory, but again that was an illusion""). [Cold Blood SPOILERS:](/s ""Rory was erased from existence, but so was virtually everything else. That's not dying"").

On the other hand, the Master has straight-up bit the dust. Turned into ash by a volcano, exterminated by Daleks, absorbed into the Eye of Harmony, shot in the chest the list goes on and on of him actually *dying*.

Seriously, only someone who had *no* idea of who the Master was or even of basic logic would honestly believe that these two characters are the same, because it just *doesn't make any sense*.

Seriously. How would [End of Time SPOILERS:](/s ""the Master escape the Time Lock"")? Hm? And what does he gain by pretending to be Rory?

There *is no clear parallel* because the two characters are *nothing alike*. The *is no connection*.

This is the main line of reasoning I dislike from market fundamentalists (for want of a better phrase).  For a start, the [balanced budget multiplier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_budget#Balanced_budget_multiplier) at least means that at least some of the deadweight loss is recovered, because a certain amount of that money would have originally been spent on imports, and therefore lost to the domestic economy anyway.  But even if we ignore that, and accept that tax only reduces GDP, I think that the aim should be to collect the money you need, while destroying as little economic activity as possible, *while also maintaining a socially acceptable minimum standard of living*.  
  
I would far rather have a tax system that decreases GDP by 10% instead of 5% if it meant that the poor and sick were better looked after, that losing your job did not mean losing your house, and where 'choice' was not used as a smokescreen for granting private firms regional monopolies.  
  
I do think they have a point in saying that the successes of the Nordic/Scandanavian systems aren't simply due to more tax and spending.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The Sea of Liverpool has swallowed up so many sailors, travellers and adventurers that you would think it was a cannibal.

 Icebergs are boat hunters and Liverpudlians are huge children with eyes full of hope and rebellion.

 For the unsinkable Titanic, her first voyage was also to be her last.

 But let's move right away to the story of one stowaway: loaded on board during the night, unnoticed - a thirty foot tall Giant capable of travelling through time, on his way to another continent to meet his daughter, the Little Giant.

 Giants don't grow old, don't grow up, they just stay the age they are for eternity - that is, if they don't die. Disaster struck in the Atlantic Ocean; everyone knows the details of the accident. The ocean liner was the pride of Liverpool, and many different Liverpudlian tradesmen were recruited, mainly to maintain the ship and to look after the passengers.

 But let's return to our gigantic passenger trapped in one of the holds. He feels the full force of the iceberg's blade. The sea rushes into the ship so fiercely that he is unable to move. 

 He is a prisoner and plummets 12,000 feet with the Titanic. We believe that, knowing he would soon die, he took his last underwater lift ride before coming to rest in a cloud of dust on the ocean bed.

 Above, petrified with fear, survivors hoped for miracles - some were rescued, that too is known.

 When the Little Giant heard the news, she sought out her uncle, the Great Giant's brother. While listening to her, the uncle made a decision that was to take him a century to carry out.

 First, he would make himself a diving suit. Then he would scour the ocean floor for the shipwreck. After that, he would bury his brother in the deep-sea bed. Most importantly, he would come back with the letter the Great Giant had written to the Little Giant Girl. This is why he walked for many long years across the ocean floor, pulling the Titanic's mail trunk to bring back the post to Liverpool.

 Such tragedies do not affect the Little Giant's morale who bravely decided to come to the reunion. While reading magazines before leaving, she discovered that there are another two famed legends in Liverpool - The Beatles music, and the sheer madness for football of the rebel City.

 Before setting up her first camp in Stanley Park, between the two football stadiums north of the city, she decides she will go on a cruise through the town on a road-sailing boat. A few hours before her arrival, as if by magic, a geyser shoots up from the ground in the city centre, to herald her arrival.

Team news tomorrow should be very interesting. Sadly that's the last bit of info I get until after the game is done, my flight almost perfectly coincides with the match

Unrelated but fair play to top, top lad Harry Redknapp. I give him a hard time but he has come out today to announce his support for us in the quest for European glory and didn't raise any objections when it was raised that our winning it would prevent Spurs competing in it (or whoever finishes 4th). Pretty classy moment from a guy who isn't everybody's cup of tea, but fair cop. In these most partisan of times, he still holds true to the belief that we (Englishmen) should support our nation's representatives in Europe regardless of tribal loyalties

If you want to try a two-parter, go with *The Empty Child* / *The Doctor Dances* It's a Ninth Doctor adventure that has the right amount of wit, laughs and freights that some of the best of Doctor Who can offer:

* Steven Moffat's first serial for the revived Doctor Who programme.

* Places the initial spotlight on Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor.

* High-concept story: Hide and go seek... with gas-mask zombies!

* The London Blitz, for the first time under Moffat's pen.

* Cliffhanger that is worth spending another 45 minutes to see how the story gets resolved.

* (Ab)use of psychic paper in *The Empty Child*; sonic screwdriver, sonic blaster and bananas in *The Doctor Dances*.

* *Everybody lives!* Finally, the Doctor catches a break and returns to the TARDIS with zero casualties left in his wake, a genuine rarity during the RTD era.

It seems that Warrior will be OK, but they are really going to have to do something special IMO to hype everyone up for their kits.  They are very unproven in the soccer kit market so they have to get the consumer to want their product.  I already enjoy the old school appeal of what the home kit may look like, so that is a good start.  And maybe it could just be the unfamiliarity with their brand, but from Sidorn's photos, the kits don't seem to have the quality of Addidas.  

Anyway, I will stop preemptively hating and as long as the kit is not god awful looking (doesn't seem to be the case) I will support the club and purchase one for the upcoming season.  Hopefully the extra money sponsorship money will be put to good use!

 I consider myself neither staunchly unionist or nationalist and I am completely open to the idea of a united Ireland. However, the blessing we have by not having US style politics (Michael D. Higgins' famous 'wanker' comment just gave me a slight chuckle there)  in this country is that politics is almost entirely about the economy, and indeed healthcare. So setting personal bias aside I was wondering why you would consider yourself a nationalist? Currently the Republic's economy is utter shite, and we'd obviously cease to have the NHS. I see no advantage to joining Ireland at this present time and surely it's better for our country if we don't.

Of course, your answer is allowed to be 'I'm just biased'. And I don't judge you at all for saying that since, being where we're from, that's a completely reasonable thing to say.

As for a single episode, I would suggest the eleventh hour because it is a good episode and has some introductory stuff since he has to explain to a new companion and you get a feel for the Doctor.

It is told mostly from Rose's perspective (showing her at home, at her shoppe, etc.) and how she encounters the Doctor. However, The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances (Moffat always peaks the interest) are good as well. 

For the Tenth Doctor, season 2 isn't too great. Hopping into a bunch of Rose/Doctor sexual tension without knowing the backstory can be extremely confusing. Blink is a remarkable episode and can scare the shit out of people, and as it is also told from Sally's POV, provides a relatable character for the audience. Season 4, Midnight would be good, as Donna isn't much in that and explaining her existence could be much simpler. 

For the Eleventh Doctor, definitely start with Eleventh Hour. A brief discussion of ""there's this guy who travels in a box and it just exploded which is why it's crashing"" would be important, but other than that is a great intro to Smith.

true,mszegedy,tennant,Tennant,"So, back to writing in actual post:

Hardly any languages are completely consistent in their inflection! I am the proud speaker of one that is (Hungarian), but even it still has some ambiguity between a couple forms (specifically, the second person indicative and subjunctive look the same). Nothing is going to be free from *some* imperfection. It's not like it was a planned thing; it sort of just came about.

Yes, what sort of language you speak definitely affects your mental fabric! There is a theory called the ""universal grammar"", invented by the renowned Noam Chomsky (and here I must stress that this is a paraphrase of a paraphrase): In the beginning, in the womb, your brain is, linguistically, a *blank slate*. A framework exists, for potentially any language whatsoever, the titular universal grammar. Now, as a person develops, *before even being born yet*, this framework is *extremely* slowly cast into the exact grammar of the languages the person speaks. This eventually solidifies, and the person loses his or her ability to learn new languages. In this manner, one's native language affects their thought processes *for life*.

You also have to account for the reverse! Remember, people add features to whatever category is most important to them! This means that different cultures will be biased towards different categories. English, for example, has lots of aspects, which are all conjugated fully in all tenses. Latin, however, handles this in such a way, however, that merely saying that it ""binds"" its aspects to its tenses is an understatement that does it little justice: they are one and the same thing! In fact, Latin students only ever learn of ""tenses"", and usually don't even know what an aspect formally is; we are taught the ""present, future, imperfect, perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect"" ""tenses"", which are, in reality, the tense-aspect combinations of present simple, future simple, past imperfect, present perfect, past perfect, and future perfect. Notice there is no past simple, or, for short, ""preterite"" or ""aorist""! The Romans were ruthlessly efficient in their expression. They didn't muck about with processing fwo categories separately; they did both af the same time. They were also the only remaining known language to have voice conjugated inherently in the verbs, as opposed to periphrastic conjugation. Actually, they didn't even have a present passive participle that could possibly have conjugated with it! No, it's all conveyed in one tiny verb ending. Mood, tense, aspect, voice... such a language is called a fusional language, in which one grapheme represents, like, five different morphemes. In Latin, not only that, but one morpheme was ascribed to many different sememes! Like, its infamous ablative case has around thirty uses or so. It can represent the agent of a sentence in the passive voice. It can represent the usage of somethig as an instrument. It can create a participle clause (a term that I just made up now; if you are interested in looking this up, you have to Google ""ablative absolute""). It can represent constraints in time (""Rome wasn't built in a day"" would have ""day"" in the ablative case, without any prepositions). It could allow a thing to be compared to with a comparative adjective. It was all all over the place! And this was good for the Romans. They had many effective, efficient tools with which to accomplish their everyday linguistical tasks. They got what they wanted, and they got it immediately. Interpret this as you may, but I think they really liked the efficiency!

I'd make something similar for Vulcans. Perhaps a tad more tidy, with a smaller sememe-to-morpheme ratio. I'd give them two or three extra tenses to refer to specific days (that is, the hesternal for yesterday, the crastinal for tomorrow, and maye the hodiernal for today). I wouldn't bother much with aspects; they seem to be too ""acute"" to me for that. I'd give them a low number of cases, and make most of them for morphosyntactic alignment (because who doesn't love morphosyntactic alignment? *I* love morphosyntactic alignment). In that spirit, I'd also probably give them a couple voices to work with, such as the reciprocal and reflexive (but not the intensive, because who needs that). I would DEFINITELY incorporate compulsory evidentials somehow, probably as a morpheme in a verb ending that also stands for four other things. I wouldn't give them any moods, though. Except maybe the imperative, or the jussive (trolololololol). I'd add in negation that is inherent in the inflection, because using a negative particle like most natural languages do is cheating because it's not creative and efficient enough. I'd make things have both definiteness and demonstration, on BOTH AXES (that is, something with a demaonstrative value isn't automatically definite!). I'd probably give them more forms than we have for that, too (like, at least FIVE forms of demonstration, proximal (this), mesioproximal, medial, mesiodistal, and distal (that), with the possible addition of the extradistal (yonder)). I'd make them have four numbers: one to refer to one, one to refer to greater than one or between zero and one, one to refer to zero, and one to refer to anything below zero. And four persons, like in Finnish. And, uhh... that's kinda it I guess.

Yes, Spanish inflects its verbs! All Romance languages are synthetic languages that inflect their verbs, but, contemporarily, usually not their nouns (except, you know, for number, like a sane person would). It even has a preterite tense like English! And, yeah, they have verb endings for person, which make having a subject unnecessary. English has them too (especially the verb to be), and so does German (ich habe, du hast...), but in neither is it okay to leave off fhe subject, even if it is completely clear what it is! This is just a rule of the languages. It's illogical, and I really don't care for it and would much rather abolish it (is a perfect idea!), but sadly it stays. :(

How I usually go about creating a language is that I give it a purpose first. What is it supposed to accomplish? Who's gonna be speaking it, and for what? And then I add features from categories that help those the most. Sometimes I like to troll the speakers as well (these verbs conjugate for gender, but only in the third person singular and second person plural, and only in the future tense! oh, and there is no past tense and morphosyntactic alignment is transitive), but mostly I like to add a lot of cool things to play around with, and purposely skimp on other things either because I'm lazy or because its absence makes sense (or I'm trolling the speakers). I'll write up a guide someday, and no one will care, but it'll still be awesome! There's actually already an existing *extremely good* guide out there, but I can't remember its name and I'm on an iPhone anyway. A couple of rounds on Google should do it, though. I hope you have fun! And remember, it's much easier if you have a goal in mind, which is why people create ""conworlds"" and ""conplanets"" to go with their conlangs!

Oh, and a temporal case refers to something happening at the time of a particular event. So, ""Monday"" in the temporal case would mean ""on Monday"", and ""Christmas"" thus would mean ""during Christmas"".",0,1334996030,null,0,true,0,c4eus5v,t3_sfh0j,t1_c4eus5v,t1_c4eagp5,null,1428766225,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The most prestigious games do not go on 'Members &amp; ST 2 Extra Per Person' sale, so it's each member for themselves

If you just plan on coming to a few games, 1 membership is fine. If you look [Here](http://www.chelseafc.com/page/TicketNews/0,,10268,00.html) you can see that after 'Members 1 Per Person' you have 'ST &amp; Members 2 Extra Per Person'. It's in this window that you can buy up to 3 tickets with 1 Membership or Season Ticket

- We have to worry about pre-teen children as well as teenagers. Saying a teenager can get around it is not really the point - that's true of all sorts of age controlled stuff. Quite frankly it's part of the fun of being a teen, but for younger kids we really do need to keep the, away from it. 

- we did all get hold of pornographic material when we were younger. BUT that was a lot tamer, and in very limited supply. Compare that to a 10 year old being able to access in seconds a million hours of hardcore porn and worse.

- there is a real problem with the proliferation of devices that can access the Internet in the home, how do parents protect phones, iPads, computers, consoles, etc. I know how, but it becomes a real hassle and it's not free. Less tech savvy people find it much more difficult. 

- IF someone could come up with an opt in ISP filter, that can be circumnavigated by a user login system, that would be a good thing for parents.
