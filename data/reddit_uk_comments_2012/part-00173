YB would be on 7 points, due to a draw and a loss against us and two wins against Udinese.

Udinese would be on 6 points, due to two wins against us and two losses against YB.

This means that YB would be top of the head-to-head league with 7 points, thus taking the 2nd place in the group and knocking us out. 

So a win means we're definitely through because of our superior head-to-head with YB, even if they win and a draw would suffice if YB were to lose. Anything less and we're out.

 River has a picture of all the doctor's faces, but she doesn't know the order that they're in. So in the library, for all River knows, she could be talking to 12. She sent the message to the doctor aiming for a time in which he knew her, but it arrived just a little too early - relatively close to the end of 10's timeline. So she did expect to be seeing a regeneration of the doctor that would have existed around the time that she knew him. Remember - she's really surprised by how young 10's eyes seem, so she didn't automatically know by looking at him that he was necessarily younger than 11.  

 I think it is a little bit implied by 11's reaction to her at the Byzantium that he did see her again as 10, both because he knows how to respond to her message and because he doesn't seem that surprised to see her again, but that's just speculation.

I just don't get it. Here we have a young player who has the knack of assisting, setting up goals, scoring and generally being the best player on the pitch in the U21 side, as well at internationals. Yet Joe Cole and Stewart Downing get picked ahead of him when there's a gap in the squad. 

His problem has always been his manager. Rafa would have eventually stopped being stubborn and played him had he stayed. Hodgson was stubborn in bring his own players in and being crap, meaning he couldn't afford to give youngsters a chance. Kenny was stubborn in forcing his expensive signings. Brendan has been stubborn in trying to look like a tactical genius by putting Downing at LB (bit us on the ass vs TOT) or Shelvey in attack. 

Now I like Brendan, but he's got to consider him vs WH. 

The only time he gets a chance is preseason where he looks great and in the EL where he gets stuck with the task of making our B team look good. 

He knows he's not going to get a chance. He knows that no matter how many times Messi Cole pulls his hamstring he will be given another chance to prove himself. He knows he's overlooked and you know what? Fine. Best of luck to him, though he won't need it. He's talented enough.

At this point in time you're lucky to even get to see, for example, UNIT in *The Power of Three* because the writers are aiming not to alienate audiences who don't know a thing about the show. This is probably why the standalone stories of this current series are so self-contained unlike the ongoing stories of S5 &amp; 6. Much as I enjoyed week-to-week arcs, casual viewers are, frankly, stupid and annoying and have low attention spans, but from a ratings point of view, they sort of keep the show going somewhat and they have zero interest in a proper mythology.

&gt;Do you feel that your health care is adequate, that you're seen in a timely manner and that you get the services you need?

This always was the case, but like everything, there has been a tendency to run these sorts of services down, and it is under particular strain at the current time.  Nonetheless, I've always found NHS services to be excellent, available, and courteous.  I've made some demands on it in my time, and it's always been there when I've needed it, I've always been able to access general and specialist doctors reasonably swiftly (with one exception as regards the latter), and when my father was very and subsequently terminally ill, he was very pleased with the treatment he received.  There are problems: our cancer survival rates are too low being the most worrisome, to my mind, but all in all it's a great institution which we would sorely miss.

&gt;Do you feel that your taxes are outrageously high?

I was a high rate tax payer in the UK, but I never felt my taxes were excessive given the amount I was earning.  I was more angry about what taxes were spent on, how regressive the system was and how it funnelled money upwards.

&gt;Given the opportunity would you trade places with a US citizen?

Most definitely not (unless I was a multi-millionaire of course).  Sorry.

&gt;Do you feel that you have fewer freedoms (not including the obvious gun restriction) than Americans?

In some areas (gun control being an obvious example, as you note), but certainly not in others.  Can you guys visit Cuba unmolested yet?  Broadly, I'd say neither are as free as they present themselves and pretend.

&gt;Do you feel that you are ""over regulated"" to the point of stifling businesses?

Yes, but governments over most of the world work to protect big business to the detriment of small, genuinely and disruptively innovative businesses anyway.

true,executivemonkey,null,null,"I am an American who has been to England.  However, I won't try to speak for the British, yet I do have something to say.

Your mother has incorrectly calculated the amount of time for which Americans must wait for health care.  As there is no right to health care in the US, people who don't have health insurance have traditionally had an infinite wait time, because they never got to see a doctor.  That infinite wait time, however, isn't included in the average wait time.  Those people were simply excluded.

Of course there will be a shorter wait time for medical care if large segments of the population are excluded; however, does your mother really want to argue that the working poor shouldn't get access to doctors so that she can reduce her wait time by a week or two?

Also, Medicaid assistance is often very hard to acquire in the US.  Medicaid is a federal program that provides some assistance with health care expenses for poor people.  The states get to set the standards that people must meet in order to get Medicaid.  In the Republican South, those standards are absurd.  For example, a family in Texas that makes $5,000 or more per year is deemed to be too wealthy to qualify for Medicaid.  Of course, $5,000 per year is not enough to keep body and spirit united, even for a single adult.  Although Obamacare originally required the states to let people access Medicaid if they couldn't afford private insurance, the Republican-dominated Supreme Court ruled that the states could opt out of that program.  Of course, the Republican South did just that.

Next, a personal peeve of mine: it's ""Democratic ways,"" not *democrat* ways.  It was Fox News and the GOP that first used the word ""democrat"" instead of the proper adjective: Democratic, and I imagine they did it because it sounds worse and creates a subtle anti-Democratic bias in the language.

The adjective used to refer to something as being of the Democratic Party is ""Democratic,"" as in, ""my Democratic ways.""  If one is referring to democracy as a system of government, one doesn't capitalize it, as it is not a proper noun.  So, ""a democratic government"" is one where the people are sovereign, whereas ""a Democratic government"" is one where the Democratic Party is in charge.

So a person would say, ""My Democratic son,"" or ""My Republican mother.""  The word ""Democrat"" properly refers to an individual person who is a member of the Democratic Party.  Using ""Democrat"" as an adjective, as in the often-heard ""Democrat Party,"" ""Democrat ways,"" ""Democrat vote,"" is just as improper as saying ""Republic Party,"" ""Republic ways,"" or ""Republic vote,"" to refer to things that are of the Republican Party.

It was the Republicans who first began using ""Democrat"" as an adjective to describe things that are of the Democratic Party.

My Dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer in quite an advanced stage last year. As part of his retirement package he has private healthcare for life. He ended up seeing the best consultant in the UK for his condition and was given a groundbreaking new treatment that cured him. On the NHS.

He never used his private health because he go the best treatment possible on the NHS. He went from seeing his GP to seeing this consultant in three days.

I am selling a share of my business. I will be taxed at 10% of the capital gain.

My children are getting an excellent education in the state sector. I can afford to go private, but the provision where I live is so good, I don't need to.

I would not trade places with a US citizen. You have too many guns, too many religious and quasi-religious idiots in positions of authority, and you can't watch telly without 9 zillion adverts every second. You also sue each other for silly reasons and you have Republicans, who are grotesque in the true sense of the word.

I have built up my own business. I don't feel I have really been regulated at all. I have to treat people reasonably fairly, but I would anyway because I am a human being and so are they.

So, please tell your Mum that I fit perfectly the mould of a Republican wet dream. Business starting, business selling, relatively rich white middle class 'built it all myself' college educated , married with children, horses and dogs, big house blah blah sort of chap.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;Do you feel that your health care is adequate

Yes.  

For all we love to complain about everything, and the man in the street thinking anything could be done better if only it were all left up to him, healthcare is not only more than adequate, it's fantastic value for taxpayer's money without question.  In the value for money stakes I'd put the BBC first, the Royals second (come on, it's 60p a year, they're political eunuchs and they're fantastic ambassadors/adverts), then the NHS pipping the Post Office to a podium spot.

But if that's not your cup of tea or morning joe, if the UK were to spend per capita on healthcare what the US spends not only would the UK have the NHS, everybody could have UK private healthcare too and there'd still be enough money left over for every family to have a state mandated weekend holiday in Paris or Barcelona, or Prague, or wherever.  

That's right, private healthcare, if that's what floats your boat, is cheaper in the UK.  

Private health providers can't justify charging policy holders thousands for an ambulance or tens of thousands for x-rays, MRIs and jabs over an extended stay when essentially they get all that on the NHS.  Okay, there mightn't be a vase of flowers in the corner of the room and you might be on a ward, but for anything serious there isn't much queue jumping to be done as the NHS will prioritise you anyway.  The NHS serves to actually keep private profits in check - that and they don't turn anybody away for having preexisting conditions or check your wallet before wondering what will stop the pain.  They just get on with it.

&gt;Do you feel that your taxes are outrageously high?

Outrageously, no.  

A more pertinent question might be do we get value for money from our taxes? - and everybody naturally has a grievance somewhere or other, but generally the UK begrudgingly gets a pretty good deal.  Certainly I wouldn't be without any of the big tax related expenditures.

&gt;Given the opportunity would you trade places with a US citizen?

He can have my aisle seat but if the drinks trolley can't get past we're switching back.

If you win the life or gene lottery everything might be fine and dandy to be a US citizen, but you'll still be  standing on a big pile of people in their own way making society work  but handed raw deals, conveniently pushed out of view from compartmentalised life.   Life is good because it sucks for someone else.  This as a rule applies everywhere, not just the US.  

The society in which everything fantastic exists in is built on the likes of cashiers and waitresses, low paid teaching jobs, nurses working 18hr shifts.  So if you're rich and able to forget that, then fine, but if you're asking where would you rather be if you were either poor or had a conscience - the UK has to win every time. A society shouldn't be judged on how well the rich and famous live but on the minimum level of care it provides to its weak, vulnerable and less fortunate - and in many cases the more altruistic and Machiavellian-denying despite profit options to the contrary.  Not socialism or big corporate hand outs; just enough to stop them from being exploited or their situation getting drastically worse, and if you can afford an additional little foot stool to help them at least get on the pole of life, all the better.

A better question would be if you were poor or starting off life from scratch on your own, where would you rather do it?  I'd far rather it be the place where employer has to treat you like a human, where the state provided education is superior, the university college is cheaper, and where the health services are universal.


&gt;Do you feel that you have fewer freedoms (not including the obvious gun restriction) than Americans?

I know for a fact I have considerably more.  

The British passport is the world's premier document for getting about.  Nothing else compares.  Greatest single document of emancipation a human can bestow or hold.  Nothing guarantees more rights and gets you into more countries, with or without visas, than flashing the old, resplendent burgundy.   

On the other hand the US has the largest prison population per capita in the world, so there's that.  Britain's quite bad on that front too, not nearly US bad though, where the problem has become something else altogether.

It's not just the freedom to travel and the languishing prison populations though.  Those other social programmes are all about freedom too.  How can you be free to take a plunge if you're tied to an old job because you really need that healthcare coverage?  The whole point of the Human Rights Act and those social programmes is not to limit freedom but to promote a minimum standard of freedom.  To set a bar and no person goes no lower.  Freedom from poverty, freedom from starvation, freedom from social entrapment.  We've admittedly still got a long way to go but at least we know which direction on the ladder is up!

Throw in all the social provision, all the freedom of movement, and then take away all the wage and poverty entrapment, and the UK clearly has more freedom for *humans*.

&gt;Do you feel that you are ""over regulated"" to the point of stifling businesses?

I reckon there might be more than a few coastal tourist destinations in the South of America that consider a lack of regulations as being rather bad for business given their beaches look like treacle sandwiches.  Some extra bank regulations might have helped businesses affected by the downturn in the world economy too, come to think of it.  So that's what?  Nearly everything.  Nearly every business - and nobody is saying that corporations can't still make billions in profit, but regulations are there to protect the little guy, and it's the little guy that makes small and medium sized enterprise work.

Nobody wants silly regulations, but I sure as hell demand predatory corporation regulations, service regulations,  food regulations and environmental regulations.

Having said that, when it comes to the Economic Freedom Index there's very little between the UK and US, and it's hardly a Republican talking point since the socially much more progressive Australia, Ireland and Canada all appear above the US.

&gt;Once, my father told me that the difference between the average Briton and the average American was that a Briton looks at a man driving a Ferrari and thinks, “What a bastard,” while an American thinks, “I’ll be him one day.” This my father considered a great virtue — as do I.

I will give you that this does partly reflect the attitudes in the UK as I have observed them, but I feel there's other factors at play here. In the right people both attitudes are positive and in the wrong people they're both negative. A motivated, industrious American says ""I'll be him one day"" and then goes out and does it, but a lazy American says the same thing and sits back and waits for it to arrive. The same for the Briton, a motivated Briton says ""what a bastard"" but then follows it up with ""I'll show him"" and then sets out to be even more successful, but the lazy Briton says ""what a bastard"" and then eats some chips while watching Coronation Street and shouting to their obese kids about ""creeping Islam"".


&gt;British elections are mean-spirited and meretricious affairs ... In them, the focus flits between mercenary discussion of what the government is going to give the people and petty bickering over inconsequential details such as which schools the candidates went to and how much money they have.

They don't have this in American politics? What was all that shit about whether Obama is a citizen or the first time round when we talked about his religion? I guess no one in the US spent any time talking about how much money Romney has?


&gt;in a “reform” that, inter alia, stipulates that to be alive is to owe something to Washington.

Just like the bible says that to be a Christian is to be god, you are the second coming of Christ! Things look different when you don't read them and make up your own conclusions.


&gt;If you question the believers’ zeal, take a look at the frenzied NHS worship at the Olympic opening ceremony.

Frenzied was the exact word I used to describe it! No, actually, I'm thinking of something else. No one has ever had anything close to a frenzied tribute to the NHS... anywhere... ever. Stop being so dramatic. Why would it be so outrageous that we like the things we decided to do as a country and want to celebrate them in our parade of all things UK? At the next US Olympics I'm going to make sure I watch the ""frenzied"" tribute to handgun ownership, I might even go a step further, how about psychotic? Rabid?

&gt;In 2010, on the BBC’s Question Time — a British current-affairs show on which the guests trip over one other to display the appropriate degree of fealty to whichever orthodoxy is in the news that week whilst the audience tries to be as clever as one can be without doing any reading

Translation: ""I know you as an American audience don't know what this is, so here is my super-biased opinion, to make sure whatever I quote them as saying is read by you as being really, really stupid/evil/mental.""


&gt;the question of impending government spending cuts was raised. One audience member stood up and, waving her hands around, asked who would mow her elderly mother’s lawn if the government no longer did it. The audience clapped. The host looked serious. 

I don't think this happened, certainly not the way it was described.


&gt;A particularly oleaginous MP proceeded to tell her that it was a “good question.” I threw a coffee cup at my television.

And then proceded to shout expletives at the &lt;insert thesaurus here&gt; British man while I masturbated myself to climax and revelled in the glory of my own indignant rage.


&gt;There will be little virtue in America if it becomes a larger version of Britain, but with free speech

Britain = North Korea


What an unbelievable load of nonsense and bare-faced lies.

Sorry I know you probably know all that already, but tell your mother, from myself and the internet, that if she honestly believes a single word in that article and any others like it, then she is putting her trust in the hands of idiots and liars. It is a narrow minded and biased point of view of British politics and although I don't understand the particulars as comprehensively, I'm sure it is an equally narrow minded and biased view of American politics.

My brother is severely disabled, he is blind, in a wheelchair, has the IQ of less than 70. The government pays for all his care, for his equipment, for his carers, for his prescriptions (mine too, all prescriptions in Scotland is free for anyone)for a centre for disabled people so he can go and socialise,  they paid to have a special flat built with wide doors and special winches, they pay the rent on the flat too, they pay my dad to care for my brother, as he can't work since it's a fulltime job. I too have a disability (mental illness) and the government pays for my psychiatrist and psychologist, for the many many GP visits I have had over the years. This is the side of ""Socialism"" that allows my family to live without worrying about bills or poverty, it protects the most vulnerable in society.

Yes.  My wife and daughter are disabled; My wife with physical problems and my daughter with some mental health issues.  We don't have to worry about paying for prescriptions, Doctor's appointments, hospital appointments, and tests (numerous MRI, CAT, CT and Xrays).  I can call our local GP and have an appointment within 48 hours, usually sooner.  A stay in hospital doesn't involve being able to prove you can afford it before being given a bed, and whilst there you are generally treated as a patient and not as a revenue generator.

&gt;Do you feel that your taxes are outrageously high?

No, It pisses me off that companies like Starbucks get away with gaming the system whilst the 'man on the street' is hit in his wallet, but I accept that without taxation we wouldn't have the NHS or welfare support.

&gt;Given the opportunity would you trade places with a US citizen?

Honestly, no.  If I was american my family and I would either be living in a slum, living on the streets or dead.

&gt;Do you feel that you have fewer freedoms (not including the obvious gun restriction) than Americans?

No, not really.  I can travel anywhere in Europe with no restrictions or need of a Visa, just using my UK passport.  I didn't have to swear allegiance to the Union flag every morning at school, and hence don't blindly assume that this is the greatest country on Earth.  I can call a police officer a cunt, and whilst I might spend the night in the cells I won't be shot.

That's all a bit rambling sorry, but I've only just woken up.

When he has played in the first team he has looked slow and not too technical. The fact that he now is 21 years old actually is more an argument against him.

Look at Sterling for example. The first 3-4 games or so you can see he's got fantastic talent, but is still young and have little strength. You look at how he plays now he is far stronger. He took the job seriously and I'm a 100% sure he put in alot of hours in the weightroom after the first few games because you can really tell the difference in that he has not been ""bullied"" around as much the last 5 games. Pacheco probably has not done this because he doesn't need to to be good at the U21. It is speculation, but I believe there is a good reason he isn't B.R's third pick.

While Shelvey may have only made a handful of starts, that's way better than the one or two games that Pacheco played (which he didn't even play as a FW/CAM in) in. I don't know, Pacheco has never had the chance to prove himself where Shelvey has always been playing. Shelvey *has* had a chance to prove himself, multiple times, actually, and while he may have scored (which should be a given, seeing as you're playing a FW), he has also shown his lack of ability to play as a striker. He can't finish, his first touch is poor, etc. Pacheco may not be molded to be a true FW, but he has the ability to play there.

true,Cepheid,cnty-uk,Nomad,"**Do you feel that your health care is adequate, that you're seen in a timely manner and that you get the services you need?**

On the whole, yes. For serious issues you are seen straight away, but some places (this is really an issue with individual NHS employees) your symptoms aren't taken seriously. My girlfriend has had chronic insomnia for around 10 years, and the Doctors STILL aren't taking her seriously.

That's mainly due to her lack of luck with lazy apathetic Doctors, not the NHS in general.

**Do you feel that your taxes are outrageously high?**

I've only started paying taxes in March this year, since I'm newly graduated, I think income tax isn't too bad considering how good our Police and fire services are, as well as many excellent services such as Citizens advice bureau, etc.

I think council tax is a little expensive, but I'm not against paying that much, I just think the services they offer should be better, but that's a local issue.

**Given the opportunity would you trade places with a US citizen?**

Never in a million years, I don't want to worry about being bankrupt because I get shitty luck with a genetic disease. I don't want to live in a tent city if I lose my job. Also everything in America is so far away from each other, I also enjoy regular cheap travelling to Europe, and our politics isn't as batshit crazy. (both the politicians and the system). Also the BBC.

**Do you feel that you have fewer freedoms (not including the obvious gun restriction) than Americans?**

We do get fewer freedoms, but in most ways that's a good thing, I've had quite a few discussions about gun control on reddit, and many Americans cannot comprehend that we just don't want guns in our society. We are happy to give the legislative power to the government to take away some freedoms for the sake of security. Even most criminals don't want guns. We are a more liberal country however, where things like Gay marriage aren't an issue. 

Also look at this thread to see what the rest of the world thinks of America's batshit crazy working conditions:

http://www.reddit.com/comments/qebia/is_it_true_that_americans_get_a_measly_2_weeks/?sort=confidence

In general the UK is not too concerned with what their neighbours get up to, in that way we are much more culturally similar to Europe than America.


**Do you feel that you are ""over regulated"" to the point of stifling businesses?**

HA! Good one, our banking sector is about as deregulated as they get! As corrupt as they are, the banks do contribute a lot to our economy, and there is constant debate about how we can be fairer about banks, without driving them away.

Remember that many British companies are run by British people, who want to do business in Britain. As long as Europe has the population and purchasing power it does, there will always be room for Business in Britain.

In general our manufacturing industries are in decline, but our High tech industries (I work in instrumentation) are well respected worldwide. The financial sector is extremely strong as I mentioned. Every European country has sectors that they tend to protect, in France they protect the farmers, in Germany they protect manufacturing, in the UK - Banking and financial institutions. I suspect that is mainly because London is such a huge centre of business, both in the UK and worldwide.

Funny that you ask this today, as yesterday was an announcement from the Chancellor of the Exchequer (the 2nd in command after the Prime minister, deals with budget and financial governing) announced a drop in corporation tax, as well as a few other things, such as 25% tax relief for the Games industry.

Conclusion - I know many people who have lived in the US, and we import SO much culture from America that it's impossible not to have a good idea of what life is like there, and I don't think I want it. There are some advantages such as cheaper living expenses. 

I could JUST about live with it if a company I worked for gave me similar working conditions as I get in the UK as well as private insurance, if I lived in a city.

""Permanent side effects from radiotherapy are more common in children, as their nervous systems are still developing and more likely to be harmed by radiation.
Physical problems following treatment for a brain tumour may include limb weakness, poor balance and uncontrollable shaking.
According to a National Cancer Institute survey, a quarter of children have fits or blackouts after the type of radiotherapy that Neon would undergo, and a third have headaches or migraines.
A small number will also be left with hearing difficulties, while some may lose their sight.
There is also a risk of mental side effects. Some children may have difficulties with learning and problem solving, and suffer from poor short-term memory.
Others may find that their brain tumour symptoms even get worse after beginning radiotherapy treatment. This is because it causes a temporary swelling in the area that is being treated, which can lead to headaches, nausea and fits.
In the short-term, the treatment can also cause tiredness and  hair loss on the area of the head being treated.
Delayed side effects, which might not appear for some months, include a loss of appetite, a lack of energy and worsening of old symptoms. This is because the radiation kills tumour cells but also damages some healthy cells, according to Cancer Research UK. 
Some patients may not experience adverse effects until years after their treatment. These problems, which can be permanent, include difficulty thinking clearly, poor memory, confusion and personality changes.

It could be better. Waiting times are much better in cities, but in rural areas (where I live) waiting times can be as long as 3 weeks to see a GP. If it's an emergency, they can usually get you in on the day, or within 24 hours.

Yes. I would like to start my own business, and have conducted several feasibility studies to that end. The bottom line just makes it a bad investment of my time and capital at the moment.

Absolutely. I am considering emigrating to the US, but I wouldn't want to leave my aging mother behind.

I idealise your absolute freedom of speech. I don't like the fact that people can be put in jail in the UK for making a racist joke. I don't like racists either, but they should be allowed to make jokes.

Additionally I think that Americans have a culture of individual liberties and freedoms. In the UK there's a culture of ""For the people"" which can result in cases of tyranny of the majority sometimes.

For example, the median British worker earns around £20k per year - on the detailled break down, this comes out at a contribution, via income tax, to the health service of just shy of £700 per year. From what I've seen of US healthcare costs, that's a pretty good deal.

Who would have ordered some tests, maybe sent you to a specialist and it would depend on how urgent the GP felt your condition was if you were seen the same day or a few weeks later. If she thought it might be bone cancer you'd get in right away, if the thought it was a sports injury it might take a few weeks to be seen. 

Depending on your insurance the GP visit would cost $125-ish and the specialist $150-300. If you have insurance, either that your employer buys for you or you buy yourself it could be a nominal fee like $25-$50. 

American insurance is complex and there are many different types of plans. All charge a monthly premium that varies with your age and health. If your 20 and not at a high risk you might pay as little as $150 a month for coverage or much more if you're a smoker. To truly astronomical amounts, my mom, the nut in question, pays $900 a month for coverage. 

Keep in mind that there is then a deductible that must be met before they will pay anything, hers was $2,000 I think. Even then the insurance would only pay if she saw doctors that were ""in the plan"". After the deductible the plan usually pays a percentage of your fees. Hers is 80%. So a $10,000 surgery for her on January 1 (before she met her deductible) would cost her $4,900 out-of-pocket. 

So back to your story, It probably would have taken a week to get you sorted out, you would have had to wait a day or two between the GP, the tests, the specialists, the results, the pharmacy and finally a follow-up visit a couple weeks later. The whole thing may have cost you as little as $20 if you had excellent insurance or as much as $1,000 if you don't have any insurance at all.

41 people indicated where they are from *and* what they call themselves overall. I did not include participants who *only* answered what they call themselves when speaking to people in the UK and the designation for foreigners - they had to say that this was a general term or for both groups of listeners for it to be tallied.

N Irish speakers total 5

* ""(N) Irish"" 3
* ""British"" 2

Scottish speakers total 6

* ""Scottish"" 4
* ""British"" 2

Welsh speakers total 2

* ""Welsh"" 2

The reason the numbers are slightly different from that small report is that I did not count the respondents' second answer. For exmaple, some people said ""I consider myself first British, and then Scottish"". Here I counted their primary response as the sole response.

1. Long story short: I love the NHS and I am thankful for it every day.
As my preface stated, I have bowel disease. I have had 7 operations, two broken arms, Broken ankle and a year physiotherapy. At no point has my family been under financial strain/stress. They worry is just not there. Most of these where when I was younger so I am not 100% sure on the wait times but I do not recall my parents complaining, My most recent OP was a non emergency colonoscopy and the wait time was 3 weeks. The care has been excellent, I love it. If my condition worsens I can call a hotline and talk with a specialist within 24 hours who can prescribe (subsidized and affordable) medication. Its exceptional.

2. They are maybe slightly high (Though given the exceptional and extensive NHS care I have received I can't complain) but they are not outrageously high.

3. There are certain things I like about American culture. I envy the gun laws (Minority view here) and envy the mindset of self protection/preservation and individual freedom, Something i believe we do not take seriously enough. Having said that, Due to your downright frightening healthcare system and politics dominated by religiousness (ironically despite your clearly defined separation of church and state) I would not trade places with a US citizen, dual citizenship would be cool (Best of both worlds?)

I have private medical insurance, because work pay for it.

A month ago I wasn't feeling well. My GP referred me to a specialist, who ordered blood tests. The next morning, the results came back and they showed that there was something seriously wrong (leukaemia). My treatment started that day. The drugs I will have to take for the rest of my life will cost several million. I do not have to pay a penny for these, and certainly don't have to deal with any insurance company and argue my case or have some crazy 'co-pay'. It will simply all be provided for me. I have had the best of care since dx, seen to extremely quickly and regularly at all times. There was absolutely no delay from 'complaint' to 'diagnosis'. When the chips are down, the NHS is excellent.

I do use my private health insurance from time to time. For example, if I sprained my ankle playing football and it's still sore a week later and I want to see a physiotherapist I will get seen to quickly at a location convenient to me (private clinic, rather than hospital) through the private system.

**Do you feel that your taxes are outrageously high?**

Depends. I think the amount of tax I pay is OK, but I don't feel that the conservative government is putting my tax money to good use, nor do I feel the tax burden is distributed fairly. Corporations get away with paying pennies, while a third of my pay goes to taxes. I wouldn't mind if it was fair.

Probably not, it depends on a lot of things though. Which US citizen? Which state?

No. The gun restriction is about the only ""freedom"" I feel I'm missing out on. Marijuana is the other one, but the US seems to treat that far worse than we do.

I think it could be treated with better services provided by a percentage of tax collected from the sale of various drugs.  This percentage should be ring fenced and only used to help people that are in need of help.  

We also must have better drugs education, none of this ""just say no"" nonsense, but proper education that no child in the country has ever received at school.  Be honest with why people do each drug, but then be honest with the risks and harm (MDMA feels brilliant and makes you feel full of energy, warm and loving, but serotonin is used up and you must allow time for it to get back to normal levels or you risk depression etc - Rather than Leigh Betts took one pill and now she's dead!)

If legalised the user wouldn't also run the risk of having a criminal record while purchasing or using said drugs, which could ruin the life of someone without mental problems, never mind someone suffering.

Some drugs don't agree with some people, that is true, nobody can deny that. Anyone that does is an idiot.  But that is no reason at all to deny the rest of us the right to use them.  The people that have issues are in the minority, they'll still be in the minority.

I've known a lot of people through the years that have not had such issues, some have become depressed, but I know plenty of sober people that do that too.  I certainly know more who have fallen into alcohol depression and worse.

true,apple_kicks,null,null,"1. I like being able to just see my GP without worrying about costs. There are walk in clinets for NHS where I live, I went once in after hurting myself at work no much of a queue or charges. Never had any problems. Even if we had private or insurence based system, doubt tax would but cut and it would just be spent elsewhere. We have the tax and service is good, needs improvement but it works. Plus if you can afford/want private there are private hospitals/services in the UK. Never had a major health problem, but with family in there I felt food was not good for thier recovery. Also private contracts still go into hospitals like agency nurses, which cause problems due to wards changing staff too often.

2. We're hitting hard times (austerity measures till 2018) so stuff like tax will be on my mind at some point. But I can currently pay it and have wages left over for bills and luxeries and good holiday money, so it's not always on my mind. Live alone/aged under 25 so my council tax gets cut, so there are ways to lower your tax bills. E.g. if you're young/old or on low income and even for disabilites. We have more social public insitutuions in UK, but this isnt in the extreme levels, you can tell countries that are because people queue for bread. However that might happen in places like Greece due to the EU crisis.

3. Not really, I like idea to live in another country but I just feel workers rights are better here and in Europe, even if there was language barrier (plus being in EU means I don't need green card). I work for US company in the UK and have done before, we compared contracts at my last office and we found we had alot more paid holiday time than the US staff. Sometimes when i have too much holiday left over my bosses tell me to use it up. I feel like UK/EU have better protection for pensions, but with finanical crisis might lose it, think we retire at 65.

4. I don't want guns. Wouldn't feel safer as protection, never needed it. I lived in the countryside and the only people who have guns it's for hobby shooting and farmers in general (we even had a rifle shop in town). Hobby shooting is fine use for guns, but farmers/thier families have a high rate of suicide becuase they keep guns in thier house (know one farmer who lost a young son this way). I like debates of freedom of speech, I hate twitter arrests think short jailtime is too much, but good to show difference between freedom of speech and discrimination against relgion/age/gender/sexual orientation/race. Guns were banned for public use due to amount of protests at the time, gov didn't want it to turn violent.

5. It's tricky we have regulation of our own, and ones which come from EU law. Some EU ones have serouisly affected fishing industry and killed off some fish/wasted some food, but it's debatable. We have regulations but sometimes even when they are broken fines are too low or law is not enforced. Press hacked phones and bribed public officials, which is against the law and police/regulators did nothing. Banks said they could self regulate and keep econmy going for everyone, and now we're in a recession. Think it needs to be balenced for freedoms to the company, but also to protect the public. Been while since UK had any large scale food recalls due to contamination or unhealthy ingredients.

&gt; Road design.

&gt; It really is that simple. Almost since the introduction of the car, roads (which were there before the car) have been designed for cars and their drivers. They have been designed to make it safer to drive a car, so that cars can drive quicker, so that cars can flow more smoothly, so that cars have somewhere to park, so that cars can get to the shops, so that cars can take us on short journeys, so that cars can take us on long journeys, so that cars can take kids to school, so that cars can cross rivers, so that cars can take you right up to the counter of MacDonalds.....the list goes on.

&gt; Life does not and more importantly should not revolve around the car. It's a tool. At times it is a very useful tool, and on rare occasions it can be a very enjoyable tool to use, but it is just a tool. Rather than using the tool for situations it is best suited for, we have designed the situations, that is our cities, to suit the tool.

&gt; It's time to change that. It's time for us to look at the other tools at our disposal, i.e. our feet, our bikes and our public transport, and redesign the environment so that we can use these tools when it is and should be appropriate.

&gt; The real war, the only true war we face is with our politicians, our councillors and our urban planners. We must fight to make them see that the time for car worship has ended. It is time to claim the streets back for people.

true,p4rus,eng-essex,Essex,"Ok, here goes. Lots of rambling, and I'm sure I've missed things out. Hope it's useful.

&gt;Do you feel that your health care is adequate, that you're seen in a timely manner and that you get the services you need?

Adequate? It's *excellent*. Me, my family, my wife's family and my friends have all received top class care from the NHS whenever we've needed it, and walked out without a bill for the privilege. None of us have ever been on waiting list for anything. 

When my Dad had a heart attack in his office, he was in theatre in a world class cardio unit inside of half an hour. He was there for nearly two weeks, the majority of which saw him in his own room, attended by several doctors, numerous nurses, physios, dieticians, etc. There were then numerous followups, some major surgery followed by another extended stay, and then yet more followups and appointments. And the cost to him and Mum? Just their taxes. That's a good service, imo. Would an insurance system have paid for that all? Without increasing your payments afterwards?

We're all going to die, most of us in a hospital, surrounded by tubes, expensive beeping machines and poo. We will all need healthcare at some point and I'd rather that didn't leave my family with a bill, thanks.

I consider the NHS to be one of the very best things about this county and would never choose to live somewhere without a similar system. This is a widely held view. The system is not perfect and will always have room for improvement. But it's a damn sight better, and cheaper, than not having it. Healthcare should never be provided by organisations who's primary goal is profit. Never.

&gt;Do you feel that your taxes are outrageously high?

Not really. But then we're (relatively) comfortable with a bit of savings behind us and I believe in a higher tax system. We're very lucky; ask the guy on minimum wage agency work what he thinks.

I'm happy to pay taxes knowing that if I fall ill, or my company goes under, my taxes have funded a system that ensures my family and I can still eat, keep up with the rent/mortgage/bills, and so on until I find my feet. I think I probably get more in return for my taxes than you do.

&gt;Given the opportunity would you trade places with a US citizen?

Nope. I love the States and I've enjoyed visiting, but it's just... not the same. It's culturally very much more different than I'd expected. I loved the sheer space though.

One of the big reasons I'd not swap is things like the NHS, by the way, and the thought that for a lot of Americans, access to healthcare and your job are intrinsically linked. I cannot imagine two things I'd rather have linked less than my healthcare and my job. I hear horror stories of companies making people redundant in the US rather than pay for their healthcare. Nope. Not cool.

&gt;Do you feel that you have fewer freedoms (not including the obvious gun restriction) than Americans?

What does this even mean? I'm free to go where I want (nationally and internationally), I can say what I like, read what I like, vote how I like and meet who I want, when and where I want to. I'm really not sure what the question is getting at.

I think we have a better legal/justice system and your prison system and prison population per capita should be a source of national shame. We're a much more liberal society in terms of civil rights which I consider to be a mark of a ""free"" country.

Regarding guns, it's quite simple: we just don't want them on our streets in large numbers. I understand they're an essential tool in some lines of work and I understand the need for a portion of our police to be armed. I've personally been shooting and I enjoyed it very much. But that's very different to giving everyone the freedom to own a handgun, a tool designed with no other purpose than to kill another human. I guess if that's a ""freedom"" thing, it's one I'm happy not to have, ta.

I also consider employers to have too much control over employees in the US. I much prefer my job security and employee rights here.

&gt;Do you feel that you are ""over regulated"" to the point of stifling businesses?

I'm not an expert on this, but what little I know suggests that I'd personally favour *more* regulation, but yeah, really not a strong point.

The UK is a party to the European Convention on Human Rights, article 10 of which guarantees freedom of expression.

The Human Right Act 1998 also gives further effect to the European Convention on Human Rights, meaning that UK courts can provide remedies for breaches of Convention rights, so you don't have to go directly to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

The idea that freedom of expression is not guaranteed by law is blatantly false propaganda spread by the Daily Mail. What they don't like people knowing is that actually most of our fundamental rights that they consider to be important are guaranteed thanks to a *European* treaty. Freedom of expression is slightly more restricted here than in the USA (for instance, hate speech is not protected speech), but that's the same across Europe.

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","&gt; We have sales tax in the US as well. I think that's analogous to VAT. In my area it's about 7%. It varies city to city and state to state. It's not charged on food or prescription drugs but TV's and laptops and ipads all get the sales tax.

I'm not sure it is. It feels that way for the guy at the end, but in actual fact it's a bit more complicated.

VAT is charged at every step of production and distribution, but the guys in the middle can claim the VAT they have paid back. So for example (and assuming everyone in the chain is VAT registered):

 - The quarry owner digs out clay and sells it to the brickworks. They buy it at, say, £10/ton and pay 20% VAT (so they actually pay £12/ton to the quarry owner; the quarry owner has to keep records and pay that £2 to the taxman every quarter).
 - The brickworks turns the clay into bricks and sells them to a wholesaler for £20/ton +VAT. (Actually, he probably sells them according to £X/Y number of bricks, but we'll stick with selling by weight because it makes things easier). The wholesaler therefore pays £24/ton. **BUT**: the brickworks claims the £2/ton they paid in the step above back from the taxman. In essence, they're only paying tax on the value they have added. Hence the name, Value Added Tax. The brickworks can also claim VAT back on almost everything else they buy to operate their business, so they won't be paying that much in VAT.
 - The wholesaler sells the bricks for £40/ton +VAT. They therefore charge £48/ton. Again, they claim back the VAT they've paid out, so they're only paying tax on the net amount.
 - The retailer sells the bricks to your builder for £80/ton +VAT - he therefore pays £96/ton. Your builder builds your extension, charges you probably not much more than £80/ton +VAT (he knows full well you won't pay £150/ton when you've seen exactly the same bricks in the builder's merchants for £80/ton, so instead he'll make that up with labour costs). He claims back the VAT he paid the builder's merchant but charges VAT for his labour.

Yes, The NHS has always been a great experience for me, I have EDS and I would always have to wait a lot longer in America to be seen than I do here on the NHS.

**Do you feel that your health care is adequate, that you're seen in a timely manner and that you get the services you need?**

The NHS isn't perfect, ut it is still amazing. It's over managed, and it's slow to respond sometimes, perhaps even a bit glib (I eventually saw a physiotherapist about my ""Carpet-layer's Knee"", and just like the old joke goes ""Doc, It hurts when I do that"", I was told ""Well don't do that""), but it works for the majority of people, and I wouldn't trade it for the world. In the same year as my knee trouble, my girlfriend needed surgery, it was scheduled within 2 weeks of finding the problem, she was in and out of surgery in one day, and that was it... no bill.

**Do you feel that your taxes are outrageously high?**

Yes. But that's just the nature of taxes. As a working man, with a mortgage, a long term girlfriend, planning to get married/get kids. I feel I am the most taxed demographic (but don't we all?). I don't mind paying taxes (which is somewhere between 1/4 and 1/5 of what I earn), because I know it goes to help others less fortunate, as well as maintain our civilisation.

I also feel there are some too fortunate, that are just given handouts because they are the most likely voters: The Elderly/Retired, who had free higher education, better wages relative to living standards, cheaper housing (and the ability to buy their rented houses from the government at cost), sold out future generations so that they may have better pensions, and now enjoy winter fuel allowances (if not refunds and/or bribes), free TV Licenses, get to abuse local GP and Medical services (so they'll live even longer), and then dare to call us ""Entitled"".

tl;dr: I am in favour of means tested benefits for all. As long as those tests are fair (unlike recent outrages by the likes of ATOS and the disabled).

**Given the opportunity would you trade places with a US citizen?**

Nope.

**Do you feel that you have fewer freedoms (not including the obvious gun restriction) than Americans?**

Nope. I can't carry a rifle, but we managed to tame our wilderness a while ago, so I see no reason to.

No, businesses have many opportunities to thrive (and avoid taxes legally), they are let down by the Banks who won't lend to the smaller companies.

£50,000 gross in the UK will net you about £35,800 after all taxes.

$80,500 gross in the US will net you about $62,000 after federal taxes and social security. That's a touch under £38,500. But then you'll have to take off however much you're paying for healthcare and as far as I know individual states can and do levy another income tax on top of that.

So for less than £3,000 extra cash in hand, the guy in the US has to pay local income tax and healthcare. The guy in the UK knows he'll never lose health care coverage from losing his job too.

Someone on $20,000/£12,400 will have almost the exact same money after taxes, but the guy in the UK will still have first rate health care and be entitled to a number of benefits to help with things like housing costs.

Since it's the internet, I have to throw in an anecdote. I made an appointment at a local free walk-in clinic for this morning at 8am. Despite turning up late and missing my appointment, I was still seen within half an hour and had a handful of tests done with absolutely no time pressure. The test results will be back within 10 days since they're not urgent.

My father had a heart attack last Thursday, at about midnight.  He was very quickly rushed to hospital, where (at 2am) he promptly got given keyhole surgery to remove a blockage from an artery.  Shortly after this he had another episode, and received more surgery, this time closer to 3am.  The quality of care in the hospital was top end stuff, and he will make a complete recovery.  There will also be comprehensive rehabilitation and monitoring.  This service was free.  I've had minor health issues over the last year or so, have always been seen promptly, had excellent quality of care in well maintained hospitals.  Again, all for free bar paying for prescriptions, which are charged at a flat rate.

2)  Given what we get in exchange for the taxes, no I do not.

3)  I've had the opportunity to move to the states, and I passed it up.  I prefer having more than 10 days of holiday per year.  Average wages haven't risen in real terms in the states in like 30 years, what's the point?

4)  Gun ownership is something which we, as a society, have democratically decided that we don't want, so we made it very difficult to obtain a gun (still legal, just difficult and heavily restricted).  We have the freedom to choose what we want the law on guns to be, I can't see how that's not the most important freedom.  A smaller % of our population is in prison, so I would counter argue that we are freeer than Americans.

5)  Nope.

true,Ginnerben,null,null,"I'm mostly going to address one point, as I feel everyone else has covered the rest quite well:

&gt;Do you feel that you have fewer freedoms (not including the obvious gun restriction) than Americans?

Something to consider is the difference between ""positive"" liberty and ""negative"" liberty.  The US generally uses the latter, while the UK uses the former. 

In the US, you're free *from* the government.  They don't take much of your money.  They don't tell you what to do with your guns.  The libertarian viewpoint, that the government should be as small as possible, and do the bare minimum, is a pretty good example.  

In the UK, by contrast, the goal is that you're free *to* do something.  The fact that you're born poor doesn't stop you from getting a university education, or treating your chronic illness.  

Now, in order for everyone to be free to do more things, some freedoms are more restricted.  You generally pay more on taxes, for example.  But who's more free:  The child who is born to a poor family, and whose parents go bankrupt paying for his medicine, leading to him having to get a job at 16, or the child who is born to a poor family and has his education and healthcare provided for, allowing him to choose his own path?

I'd argue the second, despite the fact that the government has interfered heavily with his life, and (assuming he does well) will continue to tax him at a higher rate as he gets older.  

That's not to say we're perfect.  Other countries do it better, but the US isn't one of them.  If you want to look at a lack of freedom, bear in mind that a child born poor in the US is more likely to stay poor than at any other time in it's history.  Freedom to suffer economic poverty like your parents did, with no real avenue for escape, isn't real freedom.  And while that's an issue that faces both the UK and the US, the difference is one of attitude.  In the US, there's a strong element that doesn't *care* about that.  The narrative of pulling yourself up by your bootstraps is enduring while the poor don't even have the boots.

I dont have a problem with the system here. I have a problem with my foot that I am dealing with and I have had no problems with the system its self. I have a minor problem dealing with being stereotyped for being an American and I have been accused of coming here for health care and getting answers from the receptionists was a problem for me. Having got past that, I have had no problems at all. I haven't had any longer waits than I would have had at a doctor in America. My husband's job has the option for private healthcare and its exponentially cheaper than what I was paying for healthcare on a single plan in America. 

&gt;Do you feel that your taxes are outrageously high?

I don't work, but my husband does. We are taxed fairly for what we get and we live comfortable with one source of income.

&gt;Given the opportunity would you trade places with a US citizen?

I did just the opposite actually. My husband and I had the choice of living in the US or the UK but we chose the UK for a variety of reasons. The biggest ones being potential income for him. 

&gt;Do you feel that you have fewer freedoms (not including the obvious gun restriction) than Americans?

I'm not quite sure what you mean by this question. The drinking laws are more relaxed here, but my neighbourhood is still safe. I get around the city easily so if I feel like going all the way out to Camden to go shopping in the markets there I can easily get there for a few quid. The only time I've ever had a police officer say anything to me was when i was riding my bike on a sidewalk.  

&gt;Do you feel that you are ""over regulated"" to the point of stifling businesses?

Nope. As I said before we live comfortably in a 2 bedroom flat in Romford with one income. We buy the things that please us; we could put a bit more in the savings account each month, but we enjoy going out to eat and doing fun things in the city. We live near the market, and I see new businesses opening all the time. Obviously businesses close too, but that happens in America.

true,Jamaicaman90,cnty-wales,Swansea,"I am Welsh-British, now 22. When I was in my first year of university, I was living in halls of residence. I fell ill at one point in the year with flu. After two weeks of trying to ride it out, I fell asleep for about 18 hours and woke up feeling worse, so I called my mum to come and pick me up. After a few hours at home, we decided I should go to hospital. Remember, at this point we all just thought I had a bad case of flu.

It turns out I had pneumonia, and the doctors said a couple more days would have seen me needing intensive care treatment. As it was, I spent 4 days in hospital from that point as I needed rest, hydration through a saline drip, and regular antibiotics, before being released with 3 sets of antibiotics to finish the process over the following month. I recovered with negligible ill effects, and not a penny was taken from either my or my parents' bank accounts. Without the NHS, my decisions may have been different and I'd be dead, or my family would now be bankrupt.

So to answer your questions:

1. Our healthcare is perfectly adequate. There are horror stories, but they are almost always either mistakes and individual errors, or a lack of a drug because the drug company is asking for an obscene amount of money for it (usually some cancer drugs). The individual errors would happen anywhere in the world and are unavoidable in the general scheme of things, while I suppose if needs be a person could try and buy the expensive drugs themselves, although if they are too expensive for the hospital they are likely too expensive for the majority of the people who would want them. They would be as equally crippling for a Brit as a typical American, I'd expect. Waiting lists only really come into it when it's a non-lifesaving surgery, such as knee replacements, or when waiting for a transplant organ, where obviously there are limited resources.

2. No. Personally I feel they could be higher, but that's a whole different debate. To specifically talk about taxes in relation to the NHS (National Health Service), I feel we get very good value for money. Things could be improved in how it is run, but that is true of everything. If you think it's perfect, you're not looking hard enough.

3. No. You have too much 'freedom' in some ways, and not enough in others. As a Brit I've been brought up a certain way, and I don't think my upbringing suits the American way of life.

4. See above. Sometimes you give yourselves less freedom by giving yourself more. In terms of the NHS again, while sorting your own medical safety is the more 'liberated' thing to do, in having that burden over you you are, in my eyes, far less free to live your life without stress.

5. The general feeling is that things weren't regulated enough, and that's why everything is buggered. I have but a limited knowledge of economics, but I feel a certain amount of regulation is needed to counter basic human greed.

**EDIT:** And a bit of personal advice, don't push this too hard. It doesn't hurt to discuss politics, but if you think that you're right and she's wrong in terms of who is the correct party to support, you've probably not good a good knowledge of politics, and if your mother is equally strong in her beliefs you may harm your relationship.",0,1354798142,null,0,1354798541,0,c7c50yw,t3_14d78j,t1_c7c50yw,t3_14d78j,null,1430594947,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

1. They love paperwork and rules for everything. You pay tax as to how many people are in your house and that limits how big / often your bin is collected.

2. Christmas is done on the 24th and Santa comes on the 6th to pick up your xmas list!! They seem much more traditional than we are here , we are more Americanized.

3. Some German humour is the same but they tend to like American comedy more (apart from the wife as she is used to British stuff).

4. Shops are shut on a Sunday which is odd but I think good.

5. They seem to take everything very seriously (My wife was shocked when people had fires in their garden and set fireworks off at random times, this is not allowed in Germany or only at certain times).

I would say were are not like any. We grew up on an island and most people never leave or get any culture, where a German can drive down the road to the Netherlands or to Belgium, France and see different cultures which is only a few hours drive away for us it is a ferry or plane and that is a barrier to most.

true,epemberton,yorkshire,People's Republic of South Yorkshire,"Well that looks like it was tossed off in 15 minutes.  Steve Coogan has clearly been made very bitter by his treatments at the hands of the press, but that is precisely why his viewpoint should be taken with a pinch of salt when debating the Leveson recommendations.

As a massive fan of Partridge over the years, I think it's pretty tacky of Coogan to use his character in this way.  He's just making Partridge recite the viewpoints of his opponents to discredit them, but adding no particular comment beyond that.  At the very least, it seems to be pretty disrespectful to his character to put so little thought and effort into the writing.

I'm still not sure where I stand on Leveson and can see the arguments on both sides, but the actions of Hacked Off are in danger of making me side with the free speechers, as they can't actually seem to provide much argument beyond just demonising the 'scary press barons'.  I'm more inclined to agree with Ian Hislop when he notes that more legislation is not whats needed, rather rigorous implementation of the legislation that currently exists, a lot of which could have punished the worst iniquities of the press revealed during the enquiry if anyone in the establishment actually had the balls to stand up to them.  The fact that I don't believe anyone in the establishment *does* possess sufficient integrity persuades me that a statutory body might be required.

It seems the debate is in danger of just denigrating into a shouting match between the two sides who have significant vested interests, whilst the likelihood of any productive reform coming out of the Leveson inquiry slips slowly out of reach.

No.

No! Living in Britain is wonderful - we just tend to complain a lot because it's what we enjoy doing.

Honestly your mother is not going to ever listen to reason. That article was so full of bs and your most recent elections proved it, they spent more time mudslinging at each other than debating the issues, and that article tries to claim its the other way around because our politicians focus more on who will be more efficient and better at the job than about who went to what college who was born where, who paid taxes when.

Obama cut Oil digging permits by roughly 50% (Romney claimed and this was more accurate than what Obama said)

He also INCREASED Oil production by 17% something Romney also admitted

This is in essence what happened with the Oil Production but no one paid attention to it no one cared what was the efficient smart move, not even Romney who was running based on his business smarts paid attention to it.

Not really no. I think they could be argued to be a bit high but in comparison to other countries in Europe, they're quite reasonable.

No offense, but never. I wouldn't even consider it

**4. Do you feel that you have fewer freedoms (not including the obvious gun restriction) than Americans?**

I would say yes. Freedom of speech should be stronger for example. A guy recently got 2 months in prison for a freaking Facebook post. These instances are tough, very very rare.

Personally, no. But it's not my area of expertise at all. My father is a conservative who works in business and he has no problems with regulations at all.

&gt;My mother had a breakdown years ago and just got stuck in the mental ward, it's was horrible and it felt like she was offered little support. She ended up drinking way too much and abusing pain killers, it was hell for a while. Thankfully she's back to her old self now, much happier. Those were dark times, but people can make it through, I really hope your family has the same success.

This was literally 2 days ago, so hard to evaluate right now. But he was prescribed a lot of drugs, most to simply knock him out to give his mind a couple of days rest, and a few to stop voices in his head. He's being visited by a nurse on a daily basis at the moment to evaluate him; the hope is that this is simply an acute reaction to drugs and after some short term management he can return to his normal self, obviously mindful that he needs to take better care of himself in future. If it turns out to be more serious and more than simply an acute reaction to drugs then treatment will obviously have to ensue and maybe we'll see a different side of things, but thus far I think the care he's received has been good. But we live in a reasonably affluent area, so care is probably better than a few other places in the country.

What sort of breakdown did your mother have if you don't mind me asking? I feel like maybe a ward might be on the cards at some stage and tbh I feel like it may be a better option than him living on his own in terms of safety. What was it about being on a ward that made it feel like there was little support?",0,1354801095,null,0,false,0,c7c5f86,t3_14brvp,t1_c7c5f86,t1_c7c4uud,null,1430595135,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Generally that means organising tax affairs as efficiently as possible within the law so as to maximise returns to investors.

Starbucks, however, is at a real risk of losing customers. I, for one, view an overpriced coffee as a luxury - one that I'm quite happy to indulge in. However if my sensibilities regard my reckless luxurious spending as harmful to UK businesses that are seen to be paying more tax than a multinational then I'm going to reconsider where I spend my luxury funds.

What I'm saying is that if other UK customers are like me they would have begun boycotting Starbucks already. This results in lost revenue to Starbucks. Thus while paying *more* corporation tax may appear irresponsible the shareholders must accept it is necessary to maintain revenue in the future.

Of course I am in a more difficult position when it comes to Amazon. I shop at Amazon because I want the lowest cost products.

I feel like maybe a ward might be on the cards at some stage and tbh I feel like it may be a better option than him living on his own in terms of safety. What was it about being on a ward that made it feel like there was little support?

She'd broken up with her partner (which was all a bit messy anyway, I think she'd been cheating on my father and nobody liked him, I'm still baffled as to why it all happened even so many years later - our family was picture perfect) and she just felt worthless.  Ended up trying to take her own life with lots of alcohol and a lot of pills.

She was sectioned and kept monitored on a ward for a while.  I still remember rushing into the hospital when I heard, she was in a wheel chair, I ran up to her hugged her and told her I loved her and was here . . . she had no reaction at all, she was like a husk.  I just couldn't get through to her.  She just sat their, didn't move, didn't register anyone. Awful times.

She got released and things got back to ""normal"" after a few months, but it took her years to get her back on her feet properly, she was constantly depressed and still has medication to sleep (I think the doctors have over prescribed them to be honest, I really wish she wasn't still taking it).

The US has a much more 'de-regulated' view on life. People are able to  get on with their lives and branch out on new endeavours free from state intervention. This is largely a fantastic thing and the can-do attitude is infectious. 

However (IMHO) the thing that stops them branching out too extremely tends to be entrenched attitudes and fear of the bad opinion of others. US society is very ritualistic and standing out from your crowd is likely to be held against you it seems, far more so than the UK where being a bit weird is often equated with being at peace with yourself and the world.

She is right that UK folk have to deal with a lot more red tape and state regulation (and taxation) than the US, but it is far from being extreme and perfectly manageable. 

The public services that UK taxation buys you are intended to provide a safety net for those who fall on hard times by accident. The 2 principle factors that stop poverty advancing are education and health. So the UK has free public schools and the National Health Service. If fate decides to give you a hard time, the state will look after your health and the education of your children (and a small income for you) while you sort yourself out. It certainly gets abused (by both benefit cheats and politicians) but the principle is good IMO.

I have never understood why the US has got so hung up about healthcare (not) being part of the basic services offered to its citizens, like education, defence, transport, etc. Maybe its my UK attitude but it looks like a no-brainer to me.

&gt;Do you feel that your health care is adequate, that you're seen in a timely manner and that you get the services you need?  

Very much so. The NHS covers absolutely everything non-elective, free at point of delivery.  
With being seen by clinicians, I can only relate to 3 experiences.  
The first was diagnosing hormone-driven epilepsy. I was taken in by a specialist within a week, had EEGs a day afterwards. I then had my prescription for anti-seizure medication a few days after that. All free, as I was 14 at the time.

The second is after a motorcycle accident. Police at the scene called for an ambulance, which despite being 10 miles from the scene arrived amazingly quickly. I was seen in A&amp;E after about 30 minutes (yes, it was an RTA, but I felt fine, and walked from the ambulance to the waiting room), and given an all clear after a scan, which I had at the same time. Couldn't ask for better. I also was given a copy of the examination results, not because I asked for them, but because someone thought they might be helpful. Again, no cost to me, and very little wait.

Third one was very recent. I'd had a piece of grit in my eye, so I booked an appointment with the doctor to check for infection. Called the surgery, and was offered an appointment 2 hours later, which I declined. I could still see, and someone else might need that in an emergency. Booked for the following day.  
At the same time as the appointment, I mentioned about a back pain that I'd had for a couple of weeks. As it was right next to my kidney, my doctor ordered a raft of tests, just to be safe. Booked in with the nurse for 4 days later (it was the middle of flu season, and this was the only surgery in a small city of about 15k people doing the vaccinations. Shut up, Ely is totally a city!), and had the results 2 days after that.  
Before I'd left, the doctor told me to get a certain type of eye drops from the pharmacy, which would have cost me £7.90. The doctor then remarked that it costs less at retail than the prescription would be (it was actually £4.something), and wrote me a note to give to the pharmacist.

Looking at it from the American perspective of private cover, our private healthcare is amazingly cheap, and tends to cover more treatment, with a wider variety of providers. At the most basic, a lot of providers will transfer you to their own facilities if the NHS can't find a space for you within a certain period of time. If the NHS do house you, the insurance company basically improves on the NHS cover with a number of extras, for example, they might fund private rooms, different food, etc.

I think looking at insurance for my wife and I, was something like £60 a month, covering everything. While not a gold standard, anecdotally we have free healthcare, and if we want to pay separately for it, we pay significantly less. Looking at other threads, the US can expect at least a $400+ a month bill for their healthcare for a married couple.

&gt;Do you feel that your taxes are outrageously high?

Not really. I pay about 30% of my total pay as taxes, but this covers everything at point of salary. The country as a whole is in a reasonable state, and while there are improvements that can be made, this can be said of every country.

&gt;Given the opportunity would you trade places with a US citizen?

Unlikely. I like the British culture, and trading it in for my impression of a US one would be a difference I wouldn't want to have.

&gt;Do you feel that you have fewer freedoms (not including the obvious gun restriction) than Americans?

Not personally. A lot of the areas where people claim we have fewer freedoms, don't actually affect me in the slightest.  
On the topic of firearms restrictions, I actually still hold a firearms licence from my time supervising rifle shooting in the Scouts. If I wanted to fire off some rounds, I could go to a friend's house, and go in the fields with the rifles. And if I want to fire something more exotic, then I can fly to my father-in-law's place in Norway, and pick some stock from his shop for some time.

//e I should point out that being licenced means I can go and buy my own firearms. I, however, choose not to.

&gt;Do you feel that you are ""over regulated"" to the point of stifling businesses?

See, this is something I can relate with, with my Mum going through the process of setting up her own massage therapy shop. When she was still training, and for the 2 years afterwards, she was able to go to client's houses, with very little regulation, other than her needing to be qualified in the therapy she was providing.  
Now she's planning on setting up a physical building for this, there are quite the large number of regulations that need to be followed, although, these are all safety related. She's had quite literally nothing impeding her from setting her business up, and the only regulation she's come across, are basically building codes, and H&amp;S regulations.

true,galenwolf,eng-manchester,Manchester - FOR SCIENCE!,"&gt; **Do you feel that your health care is adequate, that you're seen in a timely manner and that you get the services you need?**

On the whole yes.  It really depends on what it is you need hospital treatment for.  I've been to hospital numerious times and the longest I had to wait was due to changing consultants.  The first I don't think really wanted to carry out the operation I required, it was rather difficult gallbladder removal. So I had to wait to get an MRI, which meant going through pre-checks etc.  Then I got switched and he decided that I didn't require one, then I had to have another pre-check to ensure I could have the operation and then I was in a few weeks later.  The care once in was great. I got to talk to the team that was operating no me, they ensured any fears I had where dealt with, which included getting put under since my family is resistant to most methods.  Woke up, and it turned out I had been operated on by one of the best consultants in the country and he managed to do it without complication which means I had keyhole rather than open.  I was out in a few days and fit and well within 2 weeks.

When I was a kid I opened up my leg with a very deep V shaped cut.  My neighbour was a fireman and stopped the blood loss, and the ambulance was there within 3 minutes and I was in ER within 8 minutes.  The NHS saved my life that day.


However when you want to talk about the NHS, the ghost of the ""death panel"" rubbish has to be addressed.  My mother had COPD, she had worked with benzine when she was young and it had damaged her lungs, for most of her life it didn't effect her but when she got to her mid 60s she got a lung infection that nearly killed her. The NHS saved her life that day and then they spent 10 years giving all the care she could hope for until she passed away when she was 74. This included meds that go for £70 a tablet, constant O2, batteries of constant exams, constant visits from our GP, and use of inhalers that went for £80 per inhaler.  All in all she was on around 10 meds a day, taking a lot every day. Each month we got a shopping bag full of meds.  My mum and dad are not wealthy, in the US they couldn't afford insurance and I doubt my mother would have been able to get it at all.  **In the US my mother would have been dead years ago.**

Saying that, our hospitals are not perfect, but they are good.  The last government invested a lot of money into the NHS but a lot of stuff was absorbed by red tape, this government has said its removed it, but the global economy has required cuts.
****
&gt; **Do you feel that your taxes are outrageously high?**

Not really, well not direct taxes. Petrol, or gas as you call it, is very expensive and everyone complains about it.  However the amount of tax is only relative to if we get value for money from it.

Depending on who you ask you'll get a different answer, depending on where they are from, thier age, their background.  Some think the immigrants get too much money whilst there are still homeless here.  Others think we spend too much on wars, others think we spend too much on renewables which would be better spent on nuclear.  It all depends on what they think the taxes should be spent on.

As for myself. I think its ok, but could be improved.  There are problems on a local level that need sorting out.

I will say this, I think our government wastes a lot of money on ""schemes"" in education, benefits, health etc.  I left highschool 15 years ago and the constant changes within the school system means a portion of the education budget would have been eaten up implementing those changes that could have been spent on the kids.

Also i'm not a fan of our miliatry spending, but don't take that as I want it cut.  Every time we try to bring in new equipment or build new ships, planes or tanks something ends up being ballsed up.  We have two super carriers being produced, due to alterations in spending now one will have to be kept on stand by. The other was being altered to use catapults, and now its been changed back.  On top of that we've retired of our current carriers before the new ones are ready.  These constant shifts in plans, shifting costs etc need to sorted it, its hurting our military.


&gt; **Given the opportunity would you trade places with a US citizen?**

There are issues that would concern me about going to the US.  You're way to religious, too fanatically about it. You remind me of England back in the 16th century, you have people pushing for creationism to be put in schools for crying out loud.  Then of course there is the TSA - an unholy body that pisses on your bill of rights daily.  I also wouldn't like to be subject to your two party system where both parties are financed by corporate pay masters. You also have ghettos that need to be dealt with. on the whole maybe not in your current state. I'm not even going to mention your food industry, you put corn syrup in bread... what the hell is wrong with you people?

Don't get me wrong, your country was founded with fine ideals, and if you had actually stuck to them then your country might be a better place now.  However where is your limited government balanced in power by the state?  Why does your president have so much power and why is he funded by corporations? Why do you even have large corporations in the first place?  Why is your military so damn big when its meant to be small and used for defence only?  Why haven't you done what your founding fathers told you to do to stop all that from happening?

I've heard people talk, people like Ron Paul, who I don't agree with on a lot of issues but damn at least the man wanted to uphold the ideals of your founding fathers.

If you had cheap health care that was inclusive and not controlled by monsterous insurance and litegation industries that inflated the prices of everything then it would be a huge plus for moving to the US.  We have the NHS and our private medical care is STILL cheaper than yours.

&gt; **Do you feel that you have fewer freedoms (not including the obvious gun restriction) than Americans?**

I do like the idea of a constituion and bill of rights but those are only good when you enforce them, American's don't. If you did then you wouldn't have the TSA for a start, nor the patriot act.

There are issues within the UK which must be dealt with. Section Five must be destroyed at all costs, and I'll be honest that whilst we do have an ""unofficial"" constitution and bill of rights that has been moulded over the centuries, we I think we could do with recodifying it into one or two documents like the US that work for the 21st century. However that would also take a people that where not as apathetic as Brits are right now.

This is minority view, but I envy the 2nd admendment, I do not envy the gun crime but that is a symptom of a larger issue rather than just ""guns"". The crime and violence would still be there even if you removed the guns.  

Your founding fathers understood that in order to keep your government in check and to ensure it didn't get to a point where it could nullify your bill of rights or the constitution that American citizens needed access to arms to be able to fight it and overthrow it, if needed.  Of course when your bill of rights was created, guns where a fact of life.  Your country was young, and you needed a gun as much as an axe or hammer.  Today instead you have what we see in the UK as ""gun culture"", where there is this love of guns that transends this idea of it being a tool that has to be respected. I don't think your founding fathers expected that to occur, I think your founding fathers where aiming more for the Canadian view of guns or the Swizz view of guns.

That said, there is no way in heaven or hell I'd trust the UK with gun ownership right now.  Whilst I hope the UK would treat them with upmost respect, we have an issue with morons and cretins in the UK which we call the Chav, these antisocial fuckwits would cause chaos if they had access to firearms.



&gt; **Do you feel that you are ""over regulated"" to the point of stifling businesses?**

No, in fact we should have been regulating banks more.  Our regulations are there to ensure big businesses cannot use their power to do whatever they like.

That's not the way I read it at all - in paragraph 34:
&gt;The operation of this commitment to symmetry and union of Canada under the British Crown was demonstrated by the adoption in 1937 of the Succession to the Throne Act, I Geo. IV, c.16. This Canadian statute effected changes to the rules of succession in Canada to assure consistency with the changes in the rules then in place in Great Britain. The changes were necessary in light of the abdication of Edward VIII in 1936. Absent this Canadian statute, the statutory change in Great Britain to account for Edward VIII’s abdication would have been contrary to Great Britain’s commitment in the Statute of Westminster. Arguably, without this statute, Edwards VIII’s abdication would not have been effective in respect of the Crown of Canada.

IE Canada had to make the same change as the UK or the monarchies would have diverged. It was not an automatic change simply because the UK changed it.

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"&gt; There's a natural self censorship as we worry about things being taken out of context.

We censor ourselves everyday in our daily lives - you talk as if this is a bad thing. When dealing with people face to face, or over the phone, we communicate according to circumstances ... you speak to your boss in a different way than your best friend, you speak to your mother in a different way than your newsagent. This is how it's always been.

However, for some reason, when people get on the internet, they lose all sense of decorum and respect, and imagine they can speak to anyone they like in the most base, disrespectful, insulting way possible, and that it's totally acceptable because of this notion of anonymity, and the idea that free speech laws in one country are automatically applicable in a forum that may contain members of multiple nationalities and cultures.

&gt; You also seem offended by ""tin foil hats""

No, I just think that when in a society where every aspect of your life is governed by numbers, be it your Social Security number, your credit card number, your credit score, your passport, which you ALL need to have any semblance of a normal life, to then be worried about the government ""spying"" on your Facebook posts is somewhat trivial. They know exactly who you are already, and really don't care that your cat is sick, or your 5 year old made his first macaroni picture at school today.

&gt; Also, it's a bit silly to use a number like 99.99% for copyright infringement. I'm willing to bet my house there is more than 0.01% non-infringement sharing.

Okay, so go onto ANY torrent site, I'll allow you to choose, and see what are the top 100 most popular downloads (by order, or by volume, it's really academic). I'd like to bet the latest Debian Distro is way, way down on that list. While we can argue semantics back and forth all day, the legal uses are far outweighed by the illegal uses.

&gt; And it would seem that the picture is more interesting anyway with recent research showing pirates actually make more legitimate purchases of copyright content than non-pirates.

Well that really depends on who commissioned the survey, and for what motives. Is someone who pirates $90 of music and buys $10 behaving in a better manner than someone who pirates $0 and buys $0 ? It's the kind of logic that would justify a serial killers actions because he's sometimes kind to cats.

&gt; Which isn't so surprising if you simply consider P2P simply the new version of radio/tv.

Well, actually streaming is the new version of radio/tv, as the bits come in the right order as you need them, not randomly in a ""torrent"" (for want of a better word).

Privacy from government censorship and the ability for whistleblowers, prisoners of conscience and people stuck in the middle of warzones to do their thing is all well and good. But don't use that as an excuse to justify getting stuff for nothing (EDIT: by a more private method) because you don't like someones business model (no matter how outdated it is).",0,1354805540,null,0,1354805782,0,c7c69hg,t3_14as8d,t1_c7c69hg,t1_c7c5xwr,null,1430595532,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

But isnt that the trend with misfits? ie the powers are always attributed to the individual due to something about them, while being realistically 'crap' or flawed and rarely improving. 

ie she has a sick father, so she has the ability to *kinda* heal him. Nathan was 'super annoying' so hes the one to become invincible (so you can never get rid of him), Curtis messed up in the past so he gets time travel, blind girl has a dog which can tell her what it sees, super christian girl suddenly becomes able to get people to act how *she* wants. 

I could go on, every character has something like this, along with their power being in some way very realistically flawed or hard to control. Its a core mechanic in the show if anything.

It's basically told through the eyes of a companion about her time with the Doctor, I imagine Rose and Ten.
For a start the title 'Run': there's not an episode goes by when the doctor and his companion(s) aren't running from someone/something.

'He will powder his guns' not literally of course, but the Doctor's reputation as the oncoming storm or the more battle-ready reputation he seems to have as 11.

I don't know where he's going, I don't know where he's been - the air of mystery the Doctor carries with him, particularly around new companions.    

Restless at night, he has horrible dreams - haunted by his past/the time war.

'Just the beating of hearts, like two drums in the grey' - the two drums are probably referring to the heart of the narrator and of the man, but I just though of a time lord's two.

We will step outside, checking out the coast is clear - stepping out of the TARDIS onto a new planet

I won't tell my mother... He won't tell his folks 'Cause they're already ghosts - self explanatory really

Then the last verse reminded me of Rose's desire to stay with the Doctor 'forever' and the sense of abandonment many companions undoubtedly feel when he inevitably moves on.

true,ColensoJory,eng-kernow,Da yw genev bos Kenedhloger Gernow,"I find claiming that ""Only the naive want to continue the war n drugs"" is naive in itself. (Saying that, I do agree with Branson's message and also recommend people to watch the [Versus: War on Drugs Debate](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSrN2zIRwN8).)

There are many people who benefit from the illegality of drugs; from the politicians, police and armed forces enforcing the various laws to the multitude of criminal organisations who make untaxed profit from this $320bn industry.

I think, even hope, there will come a day when the only people left supporting such a war are the criminals profiting from it. Then we'll know who to arrest and the rest of us can live safely in peace.

The biggest hurdle that needs to be overcome is the ignorance of the general population, the war has spent decades handing out propaganda and disinformation and it has become a ingrained part of modern society. Look at the dismissal of Dr. David Nutt, fired from his position not because he was wrong, the position he held was clear of the respect and authority placed in him, but because he announced something that was just against the ideals we have as a society; ""What alcohol and tobacco worse than, Cannabis, LSD &amp; MDMA?"". It's for that reason why government couldn't associate themselves with his findings. 

I believe in time to come we'll find the politicians to be more clued up than what their politics show. 

Like what has been previously mentioned legalisation would not lead to an increase in drug addled criminals, the drugs a readily available now if you so wish to do them you will regardless of the laws or lack thereof. The biggest factor leading to drug related crimes is purely because drug (ab)users have to associate themselves with, in the majority of cases, unpleasant criminals for their needs. 

Let's ignore whether or not drug use and abuse is a health issue, people takes drugs for the same reasons people drink alcohol or smoke tobacco, *because they make you feel fucking awesome*. They're an enjoyable experience nothing more nothing less.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Do you feel that your health care is adequate, that you're seen in a timely manner and that you get the services you need?

NHS care is far better than the American system, but compared to the continent it is underfunded. And we have yet to see the results of the partial privatization.. I had private healthcare until I was 17 through my Dad's job, but the NHS was so convenient that we didn't ever use it. I didn't know I had it until it finished. There are some areas where I would strongly recommend private care - anyone who has seen the difference between public and private retirement homes can tell you that it's the difference between squalor and comfort. 

&gt;Do you feel that your taxes are outrageously high?

VAT is far too high, corportation tax is far too low, the upper tax bracket is too low, and the lower tax brackets are too high. 

&gt;Given the opportunity would you trade places with a US citizen?

As a student, fuck no. I've heard horror stories of sixty hour weeks and hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt that you need to start repaying a few months after graduation. I may look into moving to the US for career purposes once I'm fully educated as British journalism is in a bad way. If I was a teacher like my mum I would stay in the UK where public sector work isn't put on a lower moral tier than war profiteering.

&gt;Do you feel that you have fewer freedoms (not including the obvious gun restriction) than Americans?

Liberal freedoms have always been protected far better in the US than in Europe, although the UK tends to be the best of the European countries. We have no Supreme Court (supreme in the literal sense - above parliament), no effective constitution and no guarantee of freedom of speech. Libel laws are outrageous. However all this goes back far before Clement Attlee - and the restrictions generally ease with left of center governments and tighten during right of center ones.

&gt;Do you feel that you are ""over regulated"" to the point of stifling businesses?

see this is interesting. See, I don't see privacy as always being a scared and hidden crypto hermit. I mean, I'm here on Reddit, happy talk openly. For me, privacy is simply having control over who is in the conversation as oppose to being obsessive about being hidden.  

At work, we adjust our conversation depending on who is in the social space. We would share certain ideas/information if it was just a trusted peer. If the boss came into the room then we would adjust naturally. Again, if a client was also in the room we adjust the conversation again. So I agree that self censorship is a natural thing.

But normally we have some measure of control over that social space. We're able to talk to find private rooms to collaborate with colleagues. It would be awkward if the client was allowed to physically be in the same room all the time. It would be awkward if the boss was physically monitoring us all the time. And it's kind of weird that the government should be entering our social space 100% of time. That's not the relationship most people are comfortable with between them and the government.   

&gt;They know exactly who you are already, and really don't care that your cat is sick, or your 5 year old made his first macaroni picture at school today.

yes/no. Data is hard to interpret and easy to misinterpret. The AQ networks do not in fact use FB to organize their cells. Social mapping is never going to catch the lone madmen. There is an argument that all this surveillance doesn't in fact improve our operational capabilities. Rather we're probably going to have a lot of false positives and innocent people harassed. We are better off investing our resources on old fashioned police work and trying to penetrate their actual social networks.

&gt;Okay, so go onto ANY torrent site, I'll allow you to choose, and see what are the top 100 most popular downloads (by order, or by volume, it's really academic). I'd like to bet the latest Debian Distro is way, way down on that list. While we can argue semantics back and forth all day, the legal uses are far outweighed by the illegal uses.

&gt;Well that really depends on who commissioned the survey, and for what motives. Is someone who pirates $90 of music and buys $10 behaving in a better manner than someone who pirates $0 and buys $0 ? It's the kind of logic that would justify a serial killers actions because he's sometimes kind to cats.

see this is where the copyright lobby has got insane. Doesn't the argument make sense that exposing people to music/movies would make them more passionate about music/movies? There's a reason why most religious cults don't charge for their propaganda; quite the opposite, they send out crazies and try to shove it down people's throats. 

It's similar with music/movies. I think most genuine middle class + consumers who pirate are still probably buying the same $X of dvd box sets or what not. The torrenting is really just a bonus.

&gt;But don't use that as an excuse to justify getting stuff for nothing (EDIT: by a more private method) because you don't like someones business model (no matter how outdated it is).

I don't see privacy as a passive thing we need to beg for. Data is power, and if users are able to control their data, then there's nothing wrong with that in my view. 

edit: I'm personally quite passionate about P2P. And I do think it's more interesting than just pirating hollywood crap. Check this out, the pirate bay has recently been promoting artists who have decided to use P2P to their advantage and choose to put their own albums up for torrenting. I feel this is likely the future.

I don't have an issue with cyclists. I personally have an issue with relative speeds, however. When I'm driving and a cyclist is moving roughly 20mph or more slower than surrounding traffic there will be problems.

When I'm walking as a pedestrian on the footpath and a cyclist zooms past me narrowly missing me at 15-20mph I get shocked and feel that my life has been put at risk.

But there are many cyclists who move at *walking pace* on the footpath (or get off their bicycles and push them); and there are many cyclists who keep to low-speed roads (20mph, occasionally 30mph, but never 40 and above). These are good people.

true,Minisuitcase,cnty-expat,SouthernturnedMidlanderExpat,"OK, there have been many excellent, detailed responses to your questions but I wanted to add my voice to the many. One lady's mind changed is a step in the right direction. 

1) Yes, 100%.  For all the reasons already stated above.  

My dad had repeated battles with cancer over several years and his care was always excellent. In hospital, with the GP and at home. He had visits from district nurses, palliative care and special equipment provided for his use at home at the end and between hospital treatments. He had a certificate for the many prescriptions (so did not have to pay,) this was great as they would have really added up. He too had private care though his job but the NHS had far better specialists for his (rare) type of cancer.  After some initial back and forth between the private service and the NHS (lasted only a few weeks) his care was exclusively from the NHS. 

I have premature age-related hearing loss. When the time comes the NHS will provide me with everything I need. I know they will be there for me and everyone I care about. For NO MONEY. I think this produces a sense of a massive safety net that makes us here in the UK sleep a little easier in our beds, even in these tough economic times. This is why we are proud. 

I also agree with what many other people have said in their responses about the fear felt by US citizens in regard to their healthcare provision, especially having it intrinsically linked to work.  It must stop many people 'taking the plunge' into a new venture or even moving to a new job. Why, in a rich, developed economy should a family with a sick child/parent etc have to worry about paying for that care (even a small proportion of it) as well as worrying about the health of their loved one?

2) No, not really for what we get. I was a mid-rate tax payer when I was last earning (about 18 months ago now) and although I thought it was a little high I suppose I was used to paying it.  

Now, having travelled for the last 13 months around India and south east Asia, I can see that we really do get brilliant value for money for everything from obvious services like the NHS, the (non-corrupt) police, ambulance, fire fighters, education (my field), the welfare state and refuse collections but from the less obvious services as well. Libraries, parks, street lighting, citizen's advice, environmental health, public toilets, children's health screening for eyesight, hearing etc and immunisations, the roads... I could go on. 

Although we (as a nation) do enjoy a good old moan about these things (and cut backs are being made;) put us in an environment where these things are poor or just non existent and it is very easy to feel proud of what our taxes do actually get spent on (as opposed to buying an official another new mansion for example.) 

3) Absolutely not, no thank you.  

This has always been my view but it was solidified during your recent election. Reading reddit gave me more of an insight into your politics than I have had before. I was / am still shocked that the Republicans are actually a mainstream party. In 2012! One of the many many reasons I could not live there is simply the amount of people there who believe in their policies. The abortion row is simply ridiculous. To have religion so wrapped up in running a multi-cultural, multi-fatih ""free"" country is ridiculous.  Some of the statements made by those wanting power were, frankly, ridiculous. And they got so many votes!! Unbelievable.  I could really go on. (...Climate change denial, the military, treatment of suspected terrorists...etc)

Also, from having visited the US several times, I was surprised about how 'inward looking' the majority of the media (and by reflection, the people) were. There was rarely a news story from outside the US. I know you have a vast country but some Americans know very very little of the 'outside world'. I don't know the statistic but many people have never left their state, let alone the country or even possess a passport. I think the people of the UK are more 'global citizens' if that is not too cliched thing to say. 

Also, you don't have the BBC. And you have too many guns floating around. 

4) I'm not so up on the relative freedoms afforded and how they differ, other than the obvious passport one already detailed by others. I feel the gun restriction here is actually a freedom. I have the freedom to walk down most streets, knock on almost everyone's door and feel free of the fear of guns. There is more CCTV here probably and I'm not a fan of that but Frankeh said it all with ""You have more freedom of speech but less actual freedom"".

5) Um, I'm not a business owner or anything but I can't see any of the regulations that affect me personally are a bad thing. Regulations about what goes into my food and drink and how it is prepared = good. Laws about the standards my house has to reach before I rent it out to go travelling (like having smoke detectors fitted etc) = good.  Rules on fair advertising so my students at school have at least a slim hope of being able to make good choices = good. Anti-competition regulations so that not every single shop is a Tesco = good. Environmental regulation to stop our natural resources becoming an industrial dumping ground = good.

&gt; We are better off investing our resources on old fashioned police work and trying to penetrate their actual social networks. 

You do know that most ""old-fashioned"" police work involves networks of informants and inside-men basically spying on the bad guys and reporting back ? It's almost like saying it's okay to have no privacy, provided we don't *know* we have no privacy ... ?

Of course, you'll argue that in the case of ""bad guys"", this is justified ... but how do you know WHO the bad guys are in the first place ? be in someone going through your bins at night, or someone keeping tabs on you from inside an unmarked police car, I don't think anyone realistically believes they can live 100% private lives (unless you live in a cave in Tibet possibly).

&gt; Doesn't the argument make sense that exposing people to music/movies would make them more passionate about music/movies?

Absolutely ... but people have always been exposed to music, you know, that thing called radio that those of us over 40 grew up with. 
Hell, even then we pirated, we used to record our favorite songs onto a cassette and swap them with our friends to play in our walkmans. 

However, we didn't pretend it was somehow a ""civil-rights issue"", nor protected by some notion of ""free speech"" - neither did we have the ability to duplicate 1 million cassettes and distribute them worldwide in 10 seconds. I don't think the copyright lobby is ""insane"", they are trying to protect their business the same as anyone else.

Now I'll agree the way they are doing it is wrong, their methods often penalize their most loyal customers and have no effect whatsoever on the very pirates they'd seek to deter - that doesn't mean what they want to achieve is wrong, just the way they are doing it.

And you really didn't address my question - ""Is someone who pirates $90 of music and buys $10 behaving in a better manner than someone who pirates $0 and buys $0 ?""

Can you justify rampant theft by making a token contribution to the system at a later date ? Okay, let's not call it theft (to avoid that old chestnut), let's call it ""loss of profits"". Can I take 9 physical DVDs from a shop, and then justify it by paying for 1 DVD a week later ? In either case, the company in question has lost N dollars in potential profits, even if the units in question only cost cents in physical monetary value for the disc and the plastic case.

&gt; There's a reason why most religious cults don't charge for their propaganda; quite the opposite, they send out crazies and try to shove it down people's throats. 

In an increasingly atheist world (thank FSM), that ""sales technique"" doesn't seem to be working out too well either ...

&gt; I don't see privacy as a passive thing we need to beg for.

Maybe, but I don't think 100% privacy is ever achievable if you wish to live in our modern society anyway ... so there's always going to be a grey area no matter what you do.

... yes it is.

That's not even something politically controversial. It's just a plain numerical fact.

&gt;Public sector net borrowing was £8.6bn in October 2012; this is £2.7bn higher net borrowing than in October 2011, when net borrowing was £5.9bn

&gt;Public sector current budget deficit was £6.7bn in October 2012; this is a £2.3bn higher deficit than in October 2011, when there was a deficit of £4.4bn

The problem with austerity is that it reduces revenues. If revenues decrease by a greater amount than spending, then your deficit will go up and austerity will be counter productive.

That's why it's important to perform austerity in times of economic boom, when the momentum behind the booming economy will keep revenues high as you wean the national economy off public spending and investment.

And then, when you go into inevitable recession (the cycle is inevitable), you should spend to stimulate the economy.

I have googled around for you and I have found this interesting theory below:

&gt; A PAIR of world-renowned quantum scientists say they can prove the existence of the soul.

&gt;American Dr Stuart Hameroff and British physicist Sir Roger Penrose developed a quantum theory of consciousness asserting that our souls are contained inside structures called microtubules which live within our brain cells.

&gt;Their idea stems from the notion of the brain as a biological computer, ""with 100 billion neurons and their axonal firings and synaptic connections acting as information networks"".

&gt;Dr Hameroff, Professor Emeritus at the Departments of Anesthesiology and Psychology and Director of the Centre of Consciousness Studies at the University of Arizona, and Sir Roger have been working on the theory since 1996.

&gt;They argue that our experience of consciousness is the result of quantum gravity effects inside these microtubules - a process they call orchestrated objective reduction (Orch-OR).

&gt;In a near-death experience the microtubules lose their quantum state but the information within them is not destroyed. Or in layman's terms, the soul does not die but returns to the universe.

No soldiers shouldn't be tested, nor anyone else unless there's something obviously wrong with them (being high at work, just like being drunk) or there's been an accident and there needs to be an investigation. 

I worked on the railway, stopped smoking because of it.  But I soon found out many lads on the track had a coke and amphetamine habit because of how fast it goes out your system.

People enjoy getting high and there's nothing wrong with that.  Just like people enjoy getting drunk or drinking, there's nothing wrong with that . . . unless it starts effecting your life / work in a negative way.

The problem is the least harmful recreational drug of all is the one most likely to get your fired because how long it stays in your system.

So in that sense, the UK's upper house - which cannot overrule the elected house -- is a better model than some document stuck in thought processes that was last applicable 200 years ago.

It is the immutability of the US Constitution and how it is used to twist and overrule elected politicians and (oddly, elected) Judges that makes me wonder why Americans even bother with elections.

Whatever someone does will be challenged, not through the democratic system, but by appeals to a 200 year old document. And most of those legal challenges are based on systems and services that didn't even exist when the constitution was written.

A constitution that can bend to the changing times is a good one - whether written down or not. The US model is a lawyers charter and that is about all it is good for.

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"Well I already addressed succession in the manner of Czech republic in my last paragraph: that example highlights just how contested and ambiguous the situation needs to be.

As with the collapse of the Yugoslav republic you were left a number of states with highly competive claims, similar populations, considerably subdivided populations, heavily divided territorial possession, both in size, and more importantly in political, economic and strategic significance. Moreover neither state sought successor status.

Thats the kind of situation you need to have to not get a singularly recognised successor state. 

And that is so radically far from the situation looked at with a seccession of one state, with a population of 5 million, from the remaining state of 55 million. The state that will be internationally recognised in terms of diplomatic relationships by every other interntional power.

Yes I could have phrased it more specifically, but as concerns this situation, and as concerns the *post I was responding too* (which suggested the UK would cease to exist as concerns membership of internaiontal bodies) the model is unambiguously that that of the Russian Federation, or of Sudan, not of the balkanisation into numerous small fragments. 

Its clear cut enough that the EU commision has been happy to confirm they will treat the large rump as the successor state. That part isn't under dispute by anyone.  

Edit lets run some examples of the most recently formed states:
South Sudan - Sudan successor state, keeps UN seat

Kosobo - Serbia successor state, keeps UN seat

Montengro - Serbia successor state, keeps UN seat, 

Timor Lest - Indonesia successor state, keeps UN seat, 

Eritrea - Ethiopia successor state, keeps UN seat, 

Microneisa- US successor state, keeps UN seat, (and a number of similar islands, though in many cases these first joined under the aegis of the UN before becoming independent members)

Nambibia- South Africa successor state, keeps UN seat

Then we have EVERY single former soviet socialist republic (fifteen)

Realistically it is only the Balkans which provides an exception to the principle, and even then not always. And that is a PARTICULARLY problematic region with regards the notion of nationalities.

Aside from Czechoslavakia and the Yugosalv republic my point holds true for the overwhelming majority of the dozens of new states since the 1980s.

THE CHUTZPAH!!!!!!!!!

From the UK UNCUT Facebook page:

Starbucks ‘hollow promises’ won’t stop our actions this Sat!

Offering to pay some tax if and when it suits you doesn’t stop you being a tax dodger Starbucks! Starbucks have been avoiding tax for over a decade and continue to deny that it p...aid too little tax in the past. 

Today’s announcement is just a desperate attempt to convince Uncutters not to occupy their stores this Sat. There’s no money yet, and hollow promises on press releases don’t fund women’s refuges or child benefits.

We need to keep up the pressure to get the government to force Starbucks and every other tax dodging company to pay their fair share, instead of pushing through these unnecessary cuts.

That is why this weekend 40 actions will take place in Starbucks stores all over the UK. http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/actions

We are now at a turning point- we have to keep the pressure up until the Government starts doing its job and stops letting tax avoiders make the rules.

40 actions all over the UK- from Belfast to Cornwall. See you in Starbucks- we have unfinished business

I've had some absolutely horrific acne, really terrible stuff. Face only, but it looked like boils at some points.

I went to my local doctor, and he gave me some skin stuff to use, didn't work, got a second appointment. Put on a pill for 3 months, little change - turns out my acne was pretty aggressive, so went to the strongest stuff the doctors could hand out - another cream.
That didn't work either, and I got a referral to a specialist dermatologist at my local hospital.

I had blood tests run, and I was put on Roaccutane. It got a bit better, but I needed a second course. More blood tests, more dermatology appointments. It worked.

Now I only get a few spots, very rarely, and I've been given something to put on them to stop them once they appear. This is a repeat subscription for 'as long as I need it' - according to my GP.

I have no doubt that if I was in America, the 18 months of treatment before going to a dermatologist alone would've cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars. Having blood tests run 6 times over a 2 month period would be incredibly high - not even taking into account my 30 minute regular appointments with the specialists. The drug I was on itself is very expensive, and that by itself would've cost me over $2000 if I was in the US of A.

And it cost me nothing - I'm a student. No complaints from me. They've been equally good when my Grandfather was in the final stages of his life, suffering with an inoperable brain tumour (shout out to Macmillan Hospice nurses who were superb). Brilliant too when my Father suffered a heart attack, my Grandmother a stroke, and now, while my great uncle has been completely debilitated with another crippling heart attack.

Healthcare here is better than it should be in some ways, people get stuff like boob jobs on the NHS is they act like it causes them mental problems to have small boobs. From my experience it's always been fine and I'd get private healthcare if it bothered me.

&gt;Do you feel that your taxes are outrageously high?

Not at all considering the amount of stuff we get given back for them, certain things like fuel duty are a bit high but I personally think people use their cars too much so hopefully it'll put them off and the cost of fuel makes me think twice about driving when I don't really need to.

Probably not, I'm sure it's fine there but I'm happy where I am so I wouldn't risk messing it up.

I don't feel like I have any lack of freedom, I can't think of any freedoms Americans have that I wish I had too.

&gt;Do you feel that you are ""over regulated"" to the point of stifling businesses?

As a business owner I would kind of agree with this, but you always have to work within the rules and it's certainly not stopping me making money. It's more the attempts to fiddle with the economy by keeping the base rate low etc. doing damage rather than the direct limits placed on businesses.

true,LinuxMage,eu,Luffbra,"OK, I work for a ""Service Partner"" within a Yodel depot.

The delivery system we use is quite strange and has three different areas.

First off, deliveries are split into Commercial deliveries and Home Deliveries. These are 2 seperate branches of the same company. 

Commercial is the side the uses the Yodel branded Mercedes sprinter vans. They do both home and Business deliveries, like the other Parcel companies do. Yodel commercial &amp; home is actually the former DHL Domestic side of the business, and is generally run by former highly experienced DHL staff.

Then, there is the HDNL side of the business. This relies entirely on sub-contracters (""Service Partners""), who are independent Courier firms using their own unmarked or own branded vehicles.  They are paid on a per-parcel drop rate. The independent couriers drop bags of parcels to the 3rd class of courier -- The Neighbourhood Couriers, who use their own cars or small vehicles and work from home at a rate that feels comfortable to them. They are also paid on a per-parcel rate.

The Ex-DHL side (Commercial &amp; Home), is highly organised and a generally tightly run ship. Everything gets properly delivered by their drivers to within reasonable control. However, they have a habit of hiring drivers from Agencies, who are normally from totally unrelated backgrounds, completely unfamiliar with the area they are delivering in, and will only work as long as they absolutely have to. They are paid Minimum wage, hourly . They generally rely on a GPS (which they have to supply themselves)  to guide them from one drop to the next. They are always given the same level of parcel round drops as the experienced regular drivers, but minus the route knowledge, and have an extremely high failure rate, as they are incapable of delivering more than 5 or 6 parcels an hour. Remember, these are the lads driving the green and orange Yodel Merc sprinters.

The HDNL side is nothing short of uncontrolled chaos.
As the couriers are self employed, and do not directly answer to Yodel managers, they are simply given a list of what needs doing each day by a Liaison manager, and its up to the service partners to see that the Neighbourhood Couriers get their allocation of parcels. They are given Handheld machines, which only work 50% of the time, as whoever setsup the route server often screws things up, and fails to correctly allocate the runs (""tour"") to the correct courier. Also, the handhelds themselves are unreliable as they run an outdated version of Windows Mobile, which has a tendency to crash. If a Neighbourhood courier is unable to work that day, it is down to the service partner to cover his route with one of his or her own drivers, which often get started at unusual times (1-2pm, earliest), because that driver has been out all morning doing bag drops to other NHC's. 

Also, the independent Service partners have to supply their own vans, and a lot of them ae generally nails or fleet hire vehicles. The Service partners also have to cover the Vacant routes with drivers (where there is no NHC hired). All routes are done by Postcode area.
Like I say, all of the service partners are paid on a per parcel rate, which means that it can be hard to make money doing this.  

I hope this has added a little clarity to the situation. Feel free to ask me things, and I will try my best to answer.",0,1354814131,null,0,1354814320,0,c7c8cy5,t3_14bh2w,t1_c7c8cy5,t3_14bh2w,null,1430596515,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In fact, I don't think it's even a compromise. I really do think the dragnet surveillance has costs greater than the benefit. Not just for civil liberties but also in terms of wasting public resources. Our planes are safer because now we lock the cockpits and we have armed marshals. Everything else has been more or less a giant waste of manpower and money. We have better things to with scare resources. 

&gt;I don't think the copyright lobby is ""insane"", they are trying to protect their business the same as anyone else.

no they are insane. see, the research seems to show that there's a positive correlation between p2p filesharing and legitimate purchasing. If this is true, then it would make sense to let it go wild. It seems like they are actually making a bad business decision here. 

They had a similar situation with Napster back in the day. Napster actually hoped to go legitimate and so in desperation actually offered the studios $1bn in royalty. They declined. The result being that they killed any chance of legitimate P2P models emerging in the US and opened up space for outfits like the pirate bay who had absolutely no interest in going legitimate. That was a bad business decision.

true,demiquaver,null,null,"Hi -- I'm English. I can categorically say without the NHS I would have died, several times over by now. I have also worked specifically within the contracts part of a local health authority, so I know what is and isn't permitted and what regulations are on hospitals and health providers. 

1. I'm seen in the order of priority the system allows for. If I'm near death, I am seen. If I am suicidal, all I would do is walk into an ER and I would be seen by a crisis team. Yes, I have to wait for 'non-urgent' issues, however -- if I have an issue, I see my GP. I can do that within a day if urgent, within a week/two weeks if non-urgent. I'm referred to a consultant, this depends on how busy that consultant is. It's December, I've had a referral come through that was submitted six weeks ago. It's not urgent. The only service in which I don't get all the support I need is mental health - this is because mental health requirements are so, so high. There are a lot of unhealthy people, there are not enough service providers and the NHS can only provide you with emergency care/short-term care rather than lifelong care - but you wouldn't expect them to. If I have urgent need, I'm seen. End of. 

I want to point out one other caveat. If medication is required for the rest of your life, that medication is provided to you, free. I have thyroid disease - I am provided with free medication, no questions or quibbles for as long as I have a medical condition that I could not survive without medication. 

2. Taxes're high, but not outrageously so. The personal tax allowance (i.e. how much you earn that isn't taxed) safe-guards living standards. I pay 30% income tax, that's higher than it used to be, more like 20%, which was preferable, infinitely so. However, the wealthier pay higher proportions. I need the NHS and other welfare programmes, I have benefited from schools and roads and infrastructure, I pay back in. We're currently probably being hit harder by retirees/pensioners from the baby boom in costs than we are with NHS bills - their budgets have been slashed. 

3. Yes -- but for personal reasons. If I swapped places with a US citizen now, my insurance would be crippling, if I even had it. With three pre-existing conditions, I'd be lucky. I couldn't afford to live there, as much as I'd love to. I need the NHS too much.

4. No? Americans have no greater freedoms than we do. Fewer taxes, maybe, but we don't have sales tax - value-added tax is absorbed into the price of things before they're sold. We know exactly what we're getting and that it's fair across all citizens of the country. 

5. No. Businesses are regulated to protect the rights of the individual, to prevent mass unemployment, destabilisation and subsequent problems. If America had been 'over-regulated' we might not be in the financial mess that is now wide-spread.

It is, and it's so easy to avoid that it's not just gigantic businesses doing it.

Example:

The rate of corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland is one of the lowest in Europe - something like 10%.

Hypothetically (though I'd want to check with an accountant before actually doing it), I could set up a shell company in the Republic of Ireland and invoice a UK company for an amount which - by an amazing coincidence - is about 100% of my pre-tax UK profit. Maybe register the brand name as a trademark under the ownership of the Irish company and then license the use of the brand name back to the UK company, that way there's something genuine being invoiced for.

I'd halve my corporation tax liability overnight.

Okay, so I'd have to pay a clever accountant in both countries to swing that. For all I know there may well be something in Irish tax law that says ""no shell companies, if you're a registered Irish company you have to demonstrate that most of your operations are actually in Ireland"". 

So if I'm a really small business, it's probably not worth it.

Regarding your examples: The PRC is the successor state. Unless you wish to argue that Taiwan is bigger than China, you are onto a loser here. The PRC did not participate in international diplomacy much prior to that, more importantly, the resolution passed by the UN declared that the PRC had ALWAYS been the rightful successor state, from the point of its formation, and the ROC's position had always been illegal.

India was never part of Britain, or the UK. It was governed independently, under a succession of different systems, but always directly under the crown, with white rulers appointed directly by her, on the advice of her Prime Minister. 

Now, if we wish to use an example from that part of the world, lets talk about Bangladesh: a state that seceeded from Pakistan. Pakistan was the official successor state and retained UN membership, Bangladesh became a new member.


Brazil became independent in 1824. Can we please not cut my sentence into pieces, or even just the piece of the sentence you are quoting:

""in the **contemporary** era in EVERY SINGLE instance.""

You live in a world where 1824 is contemporary? Its worth noting, its entirely possible in that context a Brazilian of Royal blood, with a claim to the throne COULD have claimed the crown and ruled from Brazil. The distance from Europe of course would have made it a challenge. Of course Brazil specifically did not wanted to do that, as it wanted to explicitly divorce itself from the legacy of Portugese royal rule. 

Regardless it is of terribly small relevance, given it happened almost two centuries ago and we have literally dozens of countries in recent decades with far more similar circumstances. Hence why I specifically said contemporary. It was not my intent to begin a debate on whether or not Constantinople was the true seat of the Roman Empire (although it was).

It's pretty safe to say that if you think anybody from the 60s up to late 80s/early 90s was the type, they were the type. Look at countries that have a lower consent age than UK currently, and you can get a understand how society could have been back then. 

It's like the moral age of consent has moved, particularly in the last decade, and now structures in society are climbing over one another to be the one to lead the charge to retrospectively punish. Each of these structures contains paedos though. Statistics will just bear that out. The police will have paedos in. There will be judge paedos. There are politican paedos. Civil servant paedos. No profession or walk of life is immune to this. Everyone wants to be seen as being the most anti-paedo for this reason. I mean, Jimmy Saville touched kids, everyone knew that. It was obvious. No-one did anything. They had too much to lose. People bottom line, only care about themselves.

I swear the more I learn about society, the less surprised I am.

As a parting, maybe I can spark someone consider why no current stars are being shown up as paedos? It's either 1) because it hasn't been investigated 2) it would cause too much structural damage. I mean like sports stars, musicians and the like haven't fucked 15 year old girls. You could lay your house that one of the group of NBA, English Premier League, NFL or Baseball stars is fucking an underage girl right this second.

1 Do you feel that your health care is adequate, that you're seen in a timely manner and that you get the services you need?

Pretty much. Could be better but then so could everything in the universe. I'd never be able to get the level of care I've got if we it was not payed through tax. I also have a lot of child hood memories of going to the hospital and I'd hate to think how much it would have cost every time I was brought into the hospital for a check up on a nasty head bang and the minor treatments that I kept getting for various ailments (I was a clumsy child)

2 Do you feel that your taxes are outrageously high?

No. I like them the way they are. What I don't pay in taxes I pay for myself and usually that means it gets marketed at me or, if it's something I'm going to have to buy like say gas, then they charge you a lot because they can and they know I'll pay.

3 Given the opportunity would you trade places with a US citizen?

HOLY FUCK NO!

4 Do you feel that you have fewer freedoms (not including the obvious gun restriction) than Americans? Do you feel that you are ""over regulated"" to the point of stifling businesses? (I combined the last two into one because it fitted my answer better)

I'm not fully sure but I *think* that generally we have slightly more liberties, freedoms, rights than US citizens do. Unorganised prostitution for instance. The creeping hand of the government does permeate a lot of life, such as those no smoking signs every where and the fact that 20% of the world's CCTV cameras are in the UK which only has 1% of the world's population. However I'm fine with it. If the regulations bother every one and benefit no one then people don't follow them. Look at marijuana. That's only policed when there's actually a problem. 

I'm rambling a bit. I think some times it feels slightly, vaguely intrusive but I think that's the way it should be. I feel comfortable with the elements of the government that are close to people's lives such as the police and CCTV networks. I'm not qualified to talk about business regulation though and I think you shouldn't have too fixed opinions on it ether.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well, we get away with it because we are the only country that doesn't negotiate with Big Pharma for drug costs. The (conservative) argument is that the US shouldn't negotiate lower prices for patients because the corporations need to make their profits (especially since they have to sell cheaply in other countries that do negotiate). BS, I say.

The other problem is that we pay our MD's substantially more than in the UK. 180k USD annually for hospitalists, 150k for primary care, 300K+ for many specialties (orthopedic surgeons median salary a couple years ago was $336k). Of course, we have to pay them more because we do not subsidize their education. The average MD leaves residency with 200-250k in debt. The relatively low wage for primary care doctors ($150K) pushes people out of primary care and into specialties, because primary care doctors cannot pay off their loans (loans of that size, when they leave their deferment period, are to the tune of around $6k per month).

Probably the last ""big"" problem in our system is the societal value of life. We have a collective belief that a longer life is always better. We will pursue aggressive treatment for people who can't afford it and won't benefit from it. If you are going to die of cancer, but this drug that costs $10k per month can make you live 3 more months, we will pay $30k to make sure you live 3 more months before you die. Society here doesn't understand the cost-vs-benefit of care, and also refuses to accept that people will die regardless of treatment. People here legitimately think we work miracles and can save anyone and everyone from any ailment, when really all we do is throw large amounts of money in an attempt to delay the inevitable, rarely stopping to consider quality of life.

So to fix US healthcare, we need to negotiate prices for big pharma, redesign our medical education system, and convince every American that they will in fact die eventually no matter what healthcare is available.

true,SteveMcQwark,canada,Ontario,"He said ""arguably"". Which means he hasn't fully evaluated that aspect of his own argument, and settling that specific issue isn't necessary for his judgement. Indeed, his speculation is incorrect, since the British Parliament used section 4 of the Statute of Westminster to legislate for the Dominions with their consent. Section 4 has since been repealed with respect to Canada, though, so the British legislation will have to more explicitly make room for the separate Canadian legislation.

If you read the conclusion, you'll see that the thrust of his arguments rests on the fact that union under the British Crown, which is a constitutional principle stated in the preamble to Canada's constitution, is unworkable if Canada doesn't share the same rules of succession as Great Britain, and therefore the Court cannot strike down any of those rules.

&gt; [36]           The impugned positions of the Act of Settlement are an integral part of the rules of succession that govern the selection of the monarch of Great Britain. By virtue of our constitutional structure whereby Canada is united under the Crown of Great Britain, the same rules of succession must apply for the selection of the King or Queen of Canada and the King or Queen of Great Britain. As stated by Prime Minister St. Laurent to the House of Commons during the debate on the bill altering the royal title:
“Her Majesty is now Queen of Canada but she is the Queen of Canada because she is Queen of the United Kingdom. . . It is not a separate office .. it is the sovereign who is recognized as the sovereign of the United Kingdom who is our Sovereign. . .” Hansard. February 3, 1953, page 1566.
[37]           These rules of succession, and the requirement that they be the same as those of Great Britain, are necessary to the proper functioning of our constitutional monarchy and, therefore, the rules are not subject to Charter scrutiny.
[38]           In the present case the court is being asked to apply the Charter not to rule on the validity of acts or decisions of the Crown, one of the branches of our government, but rather to disrupt the core of how the monarchy functions, namely the rules by which succession is determined. To do this would make the constitutional principle of Union under the British Crown together with other Commonwealth countries unworkable, would defeat a manifest intention expressed in the preamble of our Constitution, and would have the courts overstep their role in our democratic structure.

Lawyers - as the voice of people who know about legal stuff. And out of the three hundred and something lords; fourteen bishops as the voice of summer fetes and begin decent.

true,orrinward,null,null,"1. I find it more than adequate. I am rarely ill so my view is less critical. My girlfriend is a US citizen living in the UK and it took her a short while to get used to our timings. She would complain about being made to wait 20 minutes as a doctor was running late on her checkups, but she was, and still is 4 years later, wowed by the fact that her healthcare was free (she was a student so didn't pay taxes).  
  
One time we both felt the service was very slow was when she woke with sudden stomach pains. We went to our nearest Accident&amp;Emergency (I guess equivalent to an emergency rook!?). We went to the counter and the lady took a brief description of what her pains were and what she perceived the severity was. We waited from about 3AM to 4AM on cold plastic seats with little information given. At around 4 she was taken for an examination and the nurse determined that it was likely to be a bladder infection. She was given some stabilisers and pain relief and we sat for a further hour and a half before she had a full checkup.  

She was in pain the whole time (to a degree) and we were both agitated that she wasn't being seen sooner, but ultimately her illness was not critical or life-threatening and it was more of a convenience thing.  
  
If we had money she could have gone private and been seen just as quickly. The default is ""you'll be taken care of but if you want it quicker you pay"", where in the States it is ""Do we have the money to find out if she's dying from diabetes"".  
  
My girlfriend has a bunch of health issues, and she is 100% in favour of the NHS over what you have in the US. Her family is on an average income but crippled by debt from previous, uninsured healthcare trouble.  
  
2. I don't believe our taxes are outrageously high. I take a very unique view on my taxes though. I'm taxed at 20% of my salary. Provided that my government takes care of me, I can support myself and my family, and I feel they're doing the right things broadly with my tax money, I couldn't care less on the percentage up to anything around 40%. I negotiate my salary based on my take-home rather than pretax so I live as comfortably as I expect to be.  
  
If I were a US citizen I would be more annoyed that more of my taxes go on military than go on healthcare and education. I think the priorities are wrong. I would happily pay an additional chunk of money for healthcare. If I felt some strain financially my fight would go against funding the military.  
  
3. Absolutely not. I intend to move to the US soon, but that is because I love my girlfriend's family and I enjoy change. I feel moving to the US is going to be a big sacrifice of my freedoms. As an outsider with non-detailed knowldge of what Obama is doing and has done, I see it as less and less of a sacrifice.  
  
4. As above, absolutely not. I feel a lot more liberated in the UK than I would in the States. Our Police force behave generally in a lot let rigid a manner when it comes to the law. The fact we don't have guns makes me feel safer.  
  
5. I can't give a great answer to this. My gut feeling as that there is a disadvantage for business in the UK compared to the US, but it is for the benefit of the people. A simple example would be in the service industry. My basic hourly rate as a waiter when I was younger in an average restaurant was £6.95/hour (that's around $11). Friends that have waitered or been bar staff in the states were making &lt;$5 an hour and relied on tips. I see some parallels with this 'over-regulation' and healthcare. Regulation helps to prevent people getting screwed but stifles some advancements. I think the UK has got the balance right and the US doesn't.

Perverting the course of justice is something you would be required to state on any job application form until the conviction has been spent. It would show up on any CRB check and a potential employer isn't going to look favourably on an application from someone who has been convicted in a court of law for being a lying cunt.

And even if they don't do you for that, you can drop yourself in the shit in other ways if it is your vehicle. If you name someone else and the Police accept it, they can check if that person was insured to drive your car. If they weren't, the Police ask you if they were driving with your permission. If you answer yes, you get done for allowing your vehicle to be driven by an uninsured person - same penalty as someone driving with no insurance so 6 points and a fine. If you answer no, the person you named gets done for stealing the car aka TWOC.

In short, if you've lied the time to own up is now.",0,1354821123,null,0,1354821433,0,c7cahp8,t3_14czh6,t1_c7cahp8,t3_14czh6,null,1430597520,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You mentioned it already,after a fashion: 

&gt; It's like the moral age of consent has moved, particularly in the last decade

People are more aware of protecting children now-a-days. Plus as soon as it became known, in general, that children had been abused everyone realised that safeguards are a good idea. That and allegations aren't dismissed as readily anymore (or shouldn't be).

You must have heard the stories from people, particularly women who were allegedly abused by Savile, where they outline how they told their teacher or similar and weren't believed. The response was ""How dare you say that about Mr Savile"" etc. Remember that there was also, and still is to an extent, stigma surrounding sexual assaults (""She was asking for it... she must have lead him on""). 

One of the most obvious responses to a question that was asked immediately when the Savile allegations came out - ""Why didn't they come forward before?!"" - is ""They weren't believed"" and/or ""who would believe them?"" As well as: ""Because people ask that question.""

When could they have come forward, apart from immediately after the incident, without that question being asked, much of the time in suspicious tone? And who is going to believe a young girl/boy when compared to a 'pillar of the community'?

&gt; now structures in society are climbing over one another to be the one to lead the charge to retrospectively punish

Not because people are coming forwards in overwhelming numbers? I agree that in a number of instances it seems that the police or CPS didn't do as thorough a job as they could, but I'm not sure it's fair to say that groups are 'jumping on the paedo-finding bandwagon', as it were.",0,1354822136,null,0,false,0,c7cass7,t3_14dqya,t1_c7cass7,t1_c7c9hfu,null,1430597814,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

They don't.
Satire aside 

They worked for a compromise, which actually is fair enough, I'm not happy to see it go but it doesn't change the day to day running of city hall, Is it disrespectful to some of the electorate, yes. Someone (not on Reddit) pointed out that people died for that flag, for the right to fly it, simply for just aligning with it, sometimes for being associated with it, the desision is certainly disrespectful to them, of course you could say that about any flag but this point is relevant to me.

&gt;Finally I'm not all that convinced that Alliance's electorate is united against them. 

Not the entire alliance electorate, but quite a few, enough to tip the balance at the next election, and probably more people willing to get of their arse and vote next time round

1.) why would Arthur give Excalibur back to Merlin after he saw how perfect the sword was? it just seems like that is something he would have held on to

2.) As the last post noted, how much trust can we really have in Mordrid? That lapse of time with Morgana in the last episode makes me wonder what really happened (was a deal struck?) That whole prophecy scene in the beginning of the season has not been seen yet either so I'm thinking that is going to still happen (granted he did use magic against her, I'm still skeptical of his good intentions.

3.) The birthing of this new dragon that is under Morgana's control really bothers me. If it was Merlin who was there when it was born, named it ect, why wouldn't the great dragon have been allowing it to grow up under it's guidance and protection (I guess I just kind of pictured it in an Eragon kind of way with the dragons and those who hatch them having a bond). How did Morgana even meet the white dragon/get it to trust her.

4.) That episode dedicated to the ""key"" Morgana was seeking for seemed like it could have had a lot greater impact on the show. This alien genius shows up and he asks it one question, and all the sudden Morgana gives up searching for it and decides to go after Gwen?

true,Froolow,null,null,"For your edutainment - it is not entirely clear our cancer treatments *are* worse than the US. It depends on exactly which statistics you look at. See if you can intuit the difference between:

&gt; The ten year cancer survival rate

and

&gt; The death rate of cancer ten years from now

Take a moment to see if you can see a difference between them, and don't worry if you can't because I am an economist specialising in the NHS and I *still* make this mistake when I read scientific papers (don't worry, I get someone to check my work before anything I do makes it into a hospital!)

The **ten year mortality rate for cancer** is your projected chance of still being alive ten years after your cancer diagnosis is confirmed. In the UK you go see a doctor, you get the bad news and have (I think) a 50-ish% chance of being alive in ten years. Obviously this depends on the cancer, but since I'm remembering the figures off the top of my head don't hold this inaccuracy against me too badly! In the US you have about a 60-65% chance of being alive a decade from your diagnosis. So the US must be better, right?

Not necessarily. If this were true then we would expect to see US citizens flourishing in the extra years of life afforded to them by the excellent US cancer treatment. In other words - if you can stomach a little bit of stats-talk - the *distribution* of deaths from cancer should be shifted to the right in the US; if 100 60 year olds have cancer today in both countries (and we somehow know none of them are going to die of anything else in the next ten years) then we expect about 50 of them to be alive and kicking in 2022 in the UK and about 60-65 in the US. This is the **cancer death rate**. If you prefer, you could intuit this by thinking, ""If US cancer treatment is so good, I'd expect to see the age everyone dies of cancer to be greater in the US.""

This is not actually the case, according to **Norton Hadler's Healthcare Economics** which is a pretty standard reference book but is *literally* all the way on the other side of the room so I'm not going to check the exact survival rates (it doesn't make a difference anyway). Although US **ten year mortality** is great, the **cancer death rate** is almost identical to the UK once you correct for eg the size of the population.

So what gives? It turns out you were right a couple of posts above; the US invests in fancy diagnostic equipment that don't give good value for money in terms of curing patients, whereas the NHS has a body called NICE that shuts that kind of thing down - we can currently only spend £20,000 if we can demonstrate that it will save at least one life, and if we want to spend £20,000 on diagnostics rather than anti-cancer medication we need a *damn* good reason to do it because NICE are shit-hot at stopping hospitals embarking on vanity projects. Expensive diagnostic tests that don't *add* years of life are **way** out, because the NHS would rather use the money to treat someone who can really benefit.

In a way, this exemplifies the difference between the two countries; the US is prepared to pay exorbitant amounts for the rich to have longer to say their 'final goodbyes' while the poor suffer whereas the NHS says, ""I don't care if you have money, we're all in this together"".

A hospital could hire its own orthopod for less, but why would that doc do it when the option of becoming a partner in a group is much more lucrative?

I don't know if surgery residents get paid more than medicine residents, but PGY1 salary for Internal Medicine residents is around $46k, with just under a 2k raise for each additional year. So PGY3 are making just over 50k. But think of how big those bucks will be when you are PGY5 senior resident!

I remember being shouted down on a forum in 2001 post WTC, saying any attempt at occupying Afghanistan will end up as a 10 year clusterfuck ending in defeat, as the Afghan's have a track record of fucking over empires.

I was wrong. It will be at least an 11 year clusterfuck ending in defeat.

Whilst there's no doubt we had to go in to get those behind 9/11, it should have been little more than a military action to kill those responsible, and then get the fuck out.

Any reasons about helping women, introducing democracy and removing more brutal forms of sharia are just bullshit, especially whilst we ignore the Saudi's, Bahraini's and the like, who are as bad if not worse. The main reason we seem to still be there is people (corporate contractors, defence companies etc) are making a lot of money out of this.

I've worked with a fairly large number of people who have vastly different reactions to weed, despite them all deciding to smoke it regardless. Just because one person is completely chilled by it, does not mean that someone else isn't going to be severely impaired by it.

With cannabis currently being illegal, that's largely what they'd be looking at testing for, if that person is doing anything illegal.

I don't really agree with it, but that doesn't give me the right to say ""NO, YOU SHOULD NOT BE DOING THAT!"". It's a matter of law, not of opinion. If it becomes legal (or even possession is decriminalised), then again, that is a case for the law.

With drugs testing in employment, I've never come across a place where I've had a random drugs test. I've worked at one place where it was in my contract that they might, but only after reasonable cause for concern was established.  
Generally speaking, if you're in a job where your action or inaction, could endanger someone else, irrespective of the outcome (within reason), then that should be a zero tolerance function for anything inhibitive. Bosses are rather skilled at finding something else for someone to do.

But we face the same problems that 1920s America faced when alcohol was illegal.  The trade carried on because people enjoy drugs (alcohol in this case).

Just like today, you can get all kinds of plants, pills and powders.  You can even get the purest of drugs online with a few clicks of a button, but there's a lot of bad people involved in the illegal drug world, because it's illegal, they operate below the law. 

Making these drugs illegal allows bad people to thrive.  It's about time we cut their funding and started to combat that danger

true,beard-maketh-the-man,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; With all respect, knowing that my theoretic child would be in the care of someone smoking the occasional spliff at the weekend, I would actually be uncomfortable with it. I've worked with a fairly large number of people who have vastly different reactions to weed, despite them all deciding to smoke it regardless. Just because one person is completely chilled by it, does not mean that someone else isn't going to be severely impaired by it.

I in no why am suggesting that people don't react negatively to cannabis.  Anyone that does is an idiot.

But the people that do react badly are in a small minority and in a teaching role it'd be picked up on rather quickly.

I find it strange people are comfortable with people going out on the weekend, hammering booze and rolling in on Monday with a hangover (it's very common) because of its legality.   Knowing the facts provided by the NHS about the harm drinking does physically and mentally.  

Although I'm not saying you're ok with that, you shouldn't be.  But it's much more accepted.

For most people enjoying cannabis doesn't effect them or the people around them in the slightest.  Why you would worry is strange considering the minimal risks for all involved.

&gt; With cannabis currently being illegal, that's largely what they'd be looking at testing for, if that person is doing anything illegal.

Speed GPS units in the cars of all teachers sounds like a great idea then.  Since it's illegal, actually kills people and certainly kills children each year.

&gt; And I'm fully expecting downvotes for this. I learned a while ago that me not having a staunchly pro-drugs stance means that my very existence seems to enrage Reddit at the best of times.

You'll get downvotes for going on about downvotes.

You don't have to be ""pro-drug"" to support the right for people to use them.  You can be very much ""anti-drug"" but still look at the facts and come to the conclusion that even though you may not like them, an adult should be allowed to consume their drug of choice.

true,SteveMcQwark,canada,Ontario,"Wall of text:

My stance is that the court case **didn't** endorse an amendment under section 41 in order to assent –  for the purposes of satisfying the constitutional convention stated in the preamble to the Statute of Westminster – to a change in succession made by the UK. The court established that rules for succession in Canada cannot diverge from those in the UK as a result of a provision in the preamble to the Constitution Act 1867 requiring us to share the same Crown, and that removing that requirement would require an amendment under section 41, which puts it beyond the competence of the Court.

Further, while I agree with the main argument the Court used to dismiss the case, and believe that argument was adequate on its own for that purpose, I disagree with some aspects of the judgement. This is okay because this was a single superior court justice trying to find an argument to dismiss a clearly frivolous case, not a panel of Supreme Court justices trying to rule on the constitutionality of law (which is why I'd be interested in a Supreme Court reference for this):

- I already mentioned that the law Canada passed to acknowledge the abdication of Edward VIII wasn't necessary for that change to come into effect in Canada. The use of section 4 of the Statute of Westminster to make laws in the Dominions by the British Parliament was certainly adequate to overcome any legislative barriers to changing the succession across the board, and the process of consent required to use section 4 satisfies the principle that all realms should have equal say is the succession to the shared throne. Section 4 has since been repealed in relation to Canada, so that won't work this time.

- I feel his argument that the succession rules themselves have constitutional status is a very weak argument, and may not even be relevant. I think he knew it was weak, which is why he put more focus on his stronger argument in the conclusion. If the two ideas ever conflicted (requiring a constitutional amendment to change succession rules, and the succession rules being constitutionally required to match those of the UK), the unity of the throne would definitely prevail, since it's explicitly stated, rather than loosely inferred.

-  I think he was incorrect in his interpretation of the preamble to the Statute of Westminster, or at least that he didn't delve deeply enough into it for the purpose of this discussion. I don't think it's there to explain how succession law will be updated uniformly once no realm has the authority to legislate for any other realm. Section 4 was sufficient for that purpose – prior to it being repealed in relation to Canada – as demonstrated during the Edward VIII abdication crisis (Australia and New Zealand didn't pass their own laws about it, and the abdication still took effect).

    The real purpose seems to be that, while the constitutions of the Dominions all require that their succession match that of the United Kingdom, the UK has no reciprocal requirement. The UK could thus change its succession with impunity, and the laws in the Dominions would be forced to change, one way or another (automatically, through judicial or legislative action, or through constitutional change removing the requirement for uniformity). None of this would require that the UK have any legislative competence in the Dominions, since it would be the effect of the Dominions' own laws. Thus, in order for the unity of the Crown to fit with the principle that all realms are equal, the UK had to promise not to change the succession without the Dominions themselves assenting to it.

- I'm still not sure whether the succession laws are even part of the laws of the Dominions. It could be that only the UK has succession laws, and the laws of the Dominions only say ""I'll have what he's having"", which ""under the Crown of the United Kingdom"" could easily be taken to mean; if it said ""under the President of France"", Canada wouldn't have to do anything if France changed its election laws. In that case, the Statute of Westminster doesn't grant any authority to Canada to amend the UK succession laws, and the Parliament of Canada can only assent to a law passed by the Parliament of the UK for the purposes of the preamble to the Statute of Westminster, not to incorporate into its own law.",0,1354829744,null,0,1354866811,0,c7cd7bd,t3_149n5r,t1_c7cd7bd,t1_c7caslp,null,1430599367,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

But you do mention that ""for most people enjoying cannabis doesn't effect them or the people around them in the slightest"". So why would someone for whom cannabis has no positive, or negative effect, continue to risk prosecution for an ineffective indulgence?

Again, it's not the action that I have the issue with, it's the illegality, and the subsequent defense that people have. Suddenly, something which is currently illegal, is now apparently OK to do, as long as someone will defend it to their last.

And no, someone turning up to work on a Monday, drastically hung over, should be sent home for the day. It's unacceptable to turn up to work drunk, and it should be equally unacceptable to turn up while still suffering the ill effects of alcohol.

So why would someone for whom cannabis has no positive, or negative effect, continue to risk prosecution for an ineffective indulgence?

I perhaps should have put ""no negative effects"".

People obviously smoke cannabis because it's really nice and enjoyable for the vast majority of us.

&gt; Again, it's not the action that I have the issue with, it's the illegality, and the subsequent defense that people have. Suddenly, something which is currently illegal, is now apparently OK to do, as long as someone will defend it to their last.

The law is certainly not a moral compass and should not be treated as such. 

But people brake the law every day.  I've never been in a car with someone that hasn't gone over the posted limit for example, or I've certainly never seen a pub turn down an obviously drunk punter (other than the belligerent or totally wrecked ones).  

I have no problem with people breaking certain laws.  I guess you do (I think that's what you're saying? - I'm not clear on your point)

Answer: [spoiler](#s ""She knew it was herself in the space suit, because that's what she was in prison for: killing the Doctor.

It's frequently mentioned that seeing young players like Sterling, Suso, Wisdom, Flanagan, etc. get opportunities is really encouraging to the rest of the academy, but ""flops"" and under-performers being given a chance to work hard and redeem themselves is just as important. It's partially just due to necessity since our squad is pretty thin, but it's an important message to send, that you have the opportunity to turn things around.

I really like how Rafa used Oscar in the Pivot towards the end of that game with Romeu, and I think that going forward I would like to see more of that. So to respond to the question of ""can you play with three #10's on the field?"" I think the answer is no, but that Oscar isn't exactly a true 10. In that case, you can absolutely play Mata and Hazard with Moses or Marin as more ""true wingers."" I think, as he bulks up and gets more physical, that Oscar could become more of a Modric type.

Walking through the desolate, deserted streets of boarded up houses next to Anfield I was standing explaining the long running talk of the new field and how it would work fitting into that section of mostly deserted houses.  An older scouse man came up to me and just started talking, very friendly like about how he grew up in the area and back when the docks were working these were full of great families and was a nice neighbourhood to live in.  We chatted for a while about Liverpool and it's fortunes and it really just endeared me to him, and a city I was already heavily favouring.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"You'll have an amazing time. One of my best friends is actually flying there tomorrow so I just made a brief guide for him seeing as it's his first time. Apologies for the poor grammar but I had to type this out extremely quickly...

""TOKYO

To save time I'd just buy a day pass on the Tokyo Metro each day. When you look at the map it shows a price next to each station in the city so you can buy say a Y200 ticket and go to any of the stations that cost that much but after a few trips it's more economical to buy the day ticket (Y1000 roughly)

Akihabara is Electric Town. Spiritual home of the 'Otaku' culture and a real treasure trove of independent shops specialising in the most niche of niche. You'll get a kick out of it I hope, a real obsession based area where one entire shop can dedicate itself to something so specific it's hard to comprehend. Some of the big electronic juggernauts like Yodobashi and Bic! Camera have moved in and displaced a lot of the small places but it's still worth a go

The Imperial Palace is a weird one. Huge grounds and a nice walk but you can't see shit, it's all behind a huge wall. Fun fact, back in the bubble days of the mid 90's, the land of the palace was worth more than all the real estate in Canada combined

Asakusa Temple. It's an alright area, nothing special, but this temple is famous and has a 5 storey pagoda. Probably the most picturesque of the temples in Tokyo, this is called Sensoji Temple

You have to check out the shopping, Roppongi Hills in particular. Stunning place and if you go around the side of it there's a massive courtyard amphitheatre and a HQ of some TV company, it's near the restaurant/cafe part of the mall. The tall building there is Mori Tower, he's like some Blade Runner style megalomaniac who owns a shitload of Tokyo real estate, and the malls that are 'X Hills'

Omatesando Hills is insane, even more expensive than Roppongi Hills. Probably my favourite mall in the world, the design is superb and it's on Omatesando-Dori which is a huge intersection of cool. Shops and cafes all the way down stretching from Harajuku (of Hollerback Girl Gwen Stefani fame) up to the National Sumo Stadium and another huge shrine. It's annoying me that the name escapes me but if you walk up Omatesando-Dori you can't miss it. Really peaceful walk around the grounds and it's where a lot of locals come to find their peace. Meiji Shrine, got it, just came to me haha. That's the name of the shrine

Akasaka as an area is pretty sweet. Lots of cafes, restaurants and bars plus some arcades. You'll find some lively shit around here, all in the area immediately surrounding the metro exit. It's like a semi-pedestrianised area if you're trying to recognise it

Ginza is the Beverly Hills of Tokyo. It's the most expensive real estate in the world and it's all boutiques and high end restaurants. Walk around to people watch.

Not far from Ginza is Shiodome, which I love. It's the financial centre and full of new skyscrapers but the area in between buildings is often covered and turned in to covered atriums. Surreal walking around there, it's the most futuristic part of Tokyo. Hama Rikyu is probably the best ornamental garden in the city and is in Shiodome

Shinjuku and in particular Hachiko crossing is a must do. It's the busiest part of the city and Hachiko is the name of the world famous crossing (or more accurately the name of a guys dog). Go to Starbucks and look out the window, you'll see people amass out of nowhere and then cross in classic organised chaos style. So much shit to do around here

Roppongi is the traditional 'nightlife' spot but in honesty there's a lot of sketchy places, a lot of hustlers trying to get you in their bars and a lot of overpriced shite. As a newbie I would say be careful around here, it's still much safer than anywhere in London but it could hurt your waller. Shit gets expensive quick!

Odaiba is fucking weird crew... It's like a semi-abandoned theme park island full of the most random shit ever. Go if you have time, huge Sega World arcade there but not a lot to see aside from the area in general. Only go if you're bored

OSAKA

Osaka is not as obviously laid out as Tokyo and is full of covered streets which turn into strip malls. The main thing here is about eating and drinking a lot. The local food speciality is Takoyaki, deep fried octopus dumplings. TakoTako King is the most famous one, but anywhere with a giant octopus statue outside is couz dez las

Check my pictures to see whats good but Shinsaibashi is a hot spot, lots of things to do and see but not anywhere close to Tokyo

KYOTO

Kinkakuji is the main thing here. It's the golden temple and stunning visually. It's not too far from Kiyomizu which is now a UNESCO Wonder, it's a temple built up on the side of a giant hill and a bit of a trek uphill but worth it. Don't go if the weather's shit or there's fog, it's a bad time

Again, best to refer to my pics for reference both on Facebook (I have albums in my pics on each city) and the Flicker account I'll link below. Kyoto station is fucking incredible and I took a lot of pictures in there

GENERAL

The Shinkansen will blow your mind, Japanese trains are a marvel. Stops along the way from Tokyo-Osaka you'll want to holler at include Nagoya and Nara for the temples/castles and Kobe for a brief visit, though Kobe is less important than the others

Yokohama is only 30 mins from Tokyo and worth a visit, it's the second biggest city in the country and together with Tokyo forms the Tokyo-Yokohama Metroplex, 40 million people""


So all of that was copy-pasted from the email I just sent him. I forgot to mention Shibuya which is next to Shinjuku and great for people watching and bar hopping. I just love Tokyo so much I tend to waffle on. Flying in next week and I have a big list of things I need to reacquaint myself with. I would love to share my pictures but my Flickr account has my real name in, if I can find a way to easily put them elsewhere I will endeavour to, they speak volumes about particular sights and areas",0,1354835824,null,0,1354836848,0,c7cf1lc,t3_14eojf,t1_c7cf1lc,t1_c7ceqey,null,1430600239,9,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,9

I translate this as - I have an opinion. 

&gt;Pakistan and the Taliban are closely linked, and Pakistan has nukes. Letting the Taliban increase power in the region would be bad for us and everyone.

The relationship between the Taliban and Pakistan is not going to be impeded by British soldiers in Helmand or wherever. Pakistani nukes are not affected by this either. And Taliban power in the region is unaffected buy British or other occupiers. The Taliban will take over Afghanistan when the occupiers leave. The occupiers will leave. 

&gt;Linked to various terrorist groups all of whom are bent on civilian targeted violence around the world. Haqqani network is a good one, read up on them.

None of these people are bent on civilian targeted violence around the world. This is imperial propaganda to make uninformed people support imperial military action. It seems to be working. 

The few attacks on civilian targets that have occurred are in response to Western, US-led imperial aggression. This includes the 2001 New York attacks and London's bombing in 2005. The continued presence of the British armed forces in Afghanistan are more likely to encourage future attacks. The idea that nutters want to attack British civilians for no good reason is pure narcissism at best and propaganda at worst. 

&gt;Thoroughly unpleasant group of people, far right fundamentalist Islamist nutters. Read up on some of the things they've done to people. We aren't exactly at war with cub scouts. Hardly the sort of people that are beneficial to British interests in a prosperous globalised society.

Far right fundamentalist nutters are unpleasant enough but the presence of British troops in Afghanistan is not really making them less unpleasant. Meanwhile, if you are looking for a model of unpleasantness, how about the British and American support for the Taliban when it suited them? Or the sanctions on Iraq that resulted in the deaths of half a million kids? Or the torture and abuse of innocent people? Or the bombed civilians? The depleted uranium? The destruction of social structures in many countries? 

The people targeted are not particularly bothered about British interests when British interests are having a negative effect on them. The fundamentalist nutters are likely happy enough to stay at home and do their nutty business. If it wasn't for a bunch of greedy shysters invading and exploiting them, you'd never hear anything about them. 

&gt;They weren't democratically elected. They enforced their rule brutally. But the government is against them, so they must be good because the goverment is bad.

Who? 

&gt; I'm not justifying the invasion of Afghanistan, I'm listing staked British interests in continuing in Afghanistan since we have already invaded. Our current government didn't invade, but they have continued the conflict.

You are justifying the presence of British troops in Afghanistan based on an entirely false perception, going on what you've written.  You accuse me of being closed minded and you parrot government propaganda. Sad.

It's a shame I didn't know the names though.

I know what you mean about Dr. Mott though, she had a very undermining affect (which is always nice in a person you are trying to impress :p) and seemed quite underwhelmed with it all. For example: when I said that alcohols do dissociate to a certain degree, she just sighed and then said very fast, under her breath 'only at very high pHs'. Having said that, I think Dr. Mott went the best, quite friendly and overall rather simple questions. 
(rate of reaction involving an enzyme when different concentrations are changing).

Dr. Latimer asked about austerity measures (with that little spreadsheet of values and stuff), all of which seemed fine. The only place I stumbled was when he asked: 'If I have just given you an instruction to inject an antibiotic into Mrs. Jones in bed 10 and a nurse comes up to you and tells you that might not be a good idea, what do you do?' 

I agree though, 135 applicants, what I thought was 25 places, and a huge number of people who have been coached for months for this opportunity; statistically, I was in a bad place from the start.

###Last year, around this time, there was a kit/shirt/jersey sale in the official shop. 50% off!

I personally bought a Parker shirt (last year) and since the plain shirt was like £45 before the sale, I kind of got the Parker-print and EPL-patches for ""free"" on the sale. £22.5+£15+£10=£47.5.

If your heart allows it, I would hold out for (hopefully) a new sale this year, for the sake of the wallet. And then I'm probably gonna go on a shopping spree.

Secondly, you are making out as if they are all people throwing themselves at them and the poor celebrities can't help but have sex with them. No. Jimmy Savile didn't just have sex with kids who wanted him to (even if they did, it would still be despicable, obviously) he **raped** them, not just statutory rape - **rape**. He abused children as young as 8 years old for christ's sake:

&gt;Claims were made about Savile's activities in hospitals. It was claimed that he sexually abused a 13-year-old patient during a visit to Stoke Mandeville Hospital in 1971 and an eight-year-old girl in the same hospital recovering from an operation. Staff reported he searched the wards for young patients to abuse and they instructed patients in the children’s ward to feign sleep during his visits.

Horrible. Secondly, in the case of One Direction et al; too bad! You should not have sex with minors - if you care more about having a ton of sex than your partners being old enough to consent, then you deserve punishment, frankly.

**Do you feel that your health care is adequate, that you're seen in a timely manner and that you get the services you need?**
Absolutely, Absolutely and Absolutely. And even if I didn't, I'd be able to go private if I so wished. But I don't. Because it's free and it's brilliant.

We Brits love to complain about everything, including our Health system, but if the public senses any drop in commitment to the NHS from our politicians, well... that's the sort of scandal that brings down governments and ends political careers.

Back when American politicians were slandering the NHS, one senator said that ""If Stephen Hawking had been British, the death panels would have let him die decades ago"". The problem being ""death panels"" are a figment of the American Right's imagination. And Hawking IS British, and has received his world-class treatment at the same government-funded hospital I was born in. Free of charge.

**Do you feel that your taxes are outrageously high?**
Not especially, no. Particularly when those taxes provide me with Healthcare, a financial safety net, our national museums have free entry and my university education has only cost me £9000.

**Given the opportunity would you trade places with a US citizen?**
Never. Why would I want to pay medical bills, be surrounded with guns and suffer a wanting lack of separation of church and state and put up with a terrible system of government which is inefficient and full of exterior interests.

**Do you feel that you have fewer freedoms (not including the obvious gun restriction) than Americans?**
We in fact have quite a bit more freedom than Americans. (The handgun ban was demanded by the public after a school shooting 20+ years ago. We have no love of guns in the UK.) Whereas you have to follow the constitution and debate endlessly about the ""founding fathers'"" intentions, we're free to continue a thousand years of constantly altering our living, breathing constitution (which, by the way, is one of the largest and most extensive in the world). 

Political donations are entered into the public record, with none of the obfuscation Americans have with Super PACs.

United States law is based on Constitutionality - you are only guaranteed the freedoms in constitutions. In Britain, which follows the common law system, absolutely everything is legal, unless there is a law that specifically makes it illegal. (One major exception is Murder, which is not strictly an offence, but has always been treated as illegal by judicial convention.)

Most of our police are unarmed and work for the public, not to control them. As such, they don't issue orders and are far more polite than seems to be the case with US law enforcement. There is a strong sense that they are there to serve us, rather than to serve the state.

**Do you feel that you are ""over regulated"" to the point of stifling businesses?**
I don't own a business, so I'm not too up on the situation, but London is the financial centre for the entire European continent, so I'd say we've got it good. It also places No. 1 (just above NYC) in Mastercard's Worldwide Centres of Commerce Index, and with NYC and Tokyo is regarded as the Centre of globalised business.",0,1354839082,null,0,false,0,c7cfy6m,t3_14d78j,t1_c7cfy6m,t3_14d78j,null,1430600663,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"I agree, there should be consequences for certain truly harmful speech: libel, slander, threats, incitement-to-violence. Because posting these kind of things has malicious intent to cause pain and/or suffering to another person, be it physical or economic.

However, in the case of twitter and facebook post arrests, the UK has crossed far over the line into suppression of (admittedly offensive but) legitimate free speech in my opinion. Just search on BBC for ""Twitter arrest"" or ""facebook arrest"" and there are already many cases of people being arrested and jailed for offensive online posts. Please note, some of these are posts that are simply offensive in that they make someone sad. There are no threats, no lies intended to cause harm to reputation etc, no speak of violence.

[Case in point](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/19059088) a man arrested for making fun of Tom Daley for not winning a medal. As far as I know, he didn't even swear or call him names. He just said, ""*You let your dad down i hope you know that.*"" While many people might agree it is a rude thing to say, I personally don't think it is worthy of a criminal record. Is it just because it was said to someone famous and loved by a majority of people? If someone were to say to me, ""ninj3, the post you made on Reddit is fucking stupid and your father would be ashamed of you."" should I have them arrested? It is merely a statement of opinion and everyone is entitled to their opinion no matter how stupid or offensive it is, so long as they don't cause physical or economic harm to someone else.

And what Sinn Fein would say is that by flying a flag that people have killed for you are being disrespectful to others. Its a bad argument either way.

&gt;

I agree with the Alliance party's decision but I'm more worried about why it was on the agenda to begin with. We have far bigger fish to fry right now than a flag. Our politicians and people are arguing over a flag, meanwhile we are haemorrhaging jobs faster than any other region in the UK. Why was this even on the agenda? Its such a waste of time which could be spent in far better ways.

Also, try a new font. That font isn't too interesting, but it's very central in your design. DaFont.com and FontSquirrel.com are both great resources of really good free fonts you can use.

&gt; ""Based on 294 health indicators in 15 categories of care, they found that overall, VA patients were more likely than patients in the national sample to receive recommended care.""

This [report](http://www.himss.org/foundation/docs/rachelmayo.pdf) from 2006 begins by saying that the ""VHA has proven itself to be a leader through distributing quality care at efficient prices"" and goes on to discuss quality of care and amount of care given, as well as the failings of the private sector in adopting VHA successes.

And this [RAND article](http://www.rand.org/commentary/2012/08/08/RAND.html) from August 2012 discusses the similarities between the NHS and VHA. It concludes by saying that:
&gt;Every health system has its faults, and the VA is no exception. In recent years, it has been challenged by severe budgetary constraints and a surge in demand, as large numbers of injured and ill veterans return from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Its Vietnam-era veterans are aging rapidly and the agency must contend with growing case complexity. When a system as big as the VA falls short, anecdotes about shortcomings get more play than reams of data.

Got seen, eh, not promptly but in fairness to them there were two car crash victims and a man who'd been assaulted come in. What am I going to say? ""I *demand* you let that man die of internal bleeding and treat my *very life threatening* hurty knee!"" No. As it was, I got seen by two doctors and a specialist, a wheelchair, x-ray, MRI, crutches, check-ups, physio, support bandages, ice packs and a lovely sticker. All within three weeks and all completely free. Tell me what else I'd have needed - a pat on the head for being a brave girl?

I'm a student, so I'm not taxed. However my parents are and having lived with them my whole life I'd have to say ... probably not? We're solidly middle class, live in a very nice area ... I mean we don't get to go on five-star holidays every year (which is mostly because my mum was made redundant and was unemployed for about nine months before getting another job), but they keep us in iPods, as it were. We don't get to buy high-end designer fashion or eat at Michelin-starred restaurants regularly, but I HIGHLY doubt that the majority of American citizens, exulting in their tax-free wealth, do.

Nooooooope. Admittedly I get a biased view of America since a lot of what I hear about it comes from, uh, Reddit. But there are some things I'm sure aren't liberal spin; the fact you have to *pay* for *healthcare*, for one. The fact that even as I attend a university that charges the maximum fees allowed my student debt may not equal even a third of an American student at a decent university (mine's a Russell Group, which is sort of equivalent to Ivy League, I think). The fact I might have been paying *fifty dollars a month* for birth control. The fact that I might not have access to abortion (not that I think this would sway your mother - I'd like to reassure her that ideally I'd never have to abort, but I don't believe it's my right to dictate other's moral values (*sort of like the Pilgrims didn't, hence the founding of America*)). Plus you have nasty bitey insects and really big storms. I'll be perfectly honest, I love America! It's a great place to visit, it's got lovely weather and beautiful scenery and the food and the people and the culture and the rest are just fantastic. But live there? No.

I guess it depends what you mean by ""freedoms"". I don't have the freedom, for instance, to hold a neo-Nazi rally in a Jewish neighbourhood, or run ""Pray the Gay Away"" adverts in a public space. But on the other hand, you're perfectly welcome to those freedoms, I want nothing to do with them. I know a lot of people disagree with me on this, Brits and all else alike, but I feel like this is one of those arguments where slippery slope works both ways. But as far as other freedoms go, I think we all take all of them for granted. Occasionally I think of how grateful I am to be born British instead of, say, Iraqi (especially as a woman). I would be interested to hear why an American would be grateful to be born American instead of British.

Couldn't help you here, since I know jack about how businesses work. I'd draw your attention however to the fact that we have the seventh largest economy in the world, the 22nd highest GDP, and London is the world's largest financial sector.

true,Kulikant,null,null,"This was just proof that comedy is all based on delivery. You can say the same words, but if they are said wrong, it doesn't make sense.

The thing that makes Inbetweeners so great, is it reminds us all of our school days, the banter in the classrooms, the halls, the playground, and our first awkward steps into drunken houseparties, trying to get served at our first pub, and going to our first gig. This is literally untranslatable to an American audience as their social system is completely different to ours, from their schooling, to their ages of legality on drinking.

I think the characters are also casted so poorly. The good thing about Neil (UK version), was although he is dumb, there were clever elements about what he said. His twisted logic was the humour. It was stupid, but you could see how he got there. Making him into a dribbling stoner who just laughs awkwardly like a real life Beavis ruins the dynamic of the group.

the Jay character just wasn't funny. It lacked the crudeness of Jay's character, nor the subtle line of ""It could be true, if he didn't go that one step too far"". The fact that American's lack subtlty meant that even the ""put the balls in too"" joke was so in your face and over played that it didn't come over as funny, just retarded.

The Simon character is almost exactly the same, so I reserve comment, but his acting drunk (the kitchen scene) made him out to be a pervert, not drunk. He almost sped up, rather than slurred.

The Will character is completely lost. His British reserve and geekiness is what makes him who he is in the English version. In the American version he's just a kid from another school, which lacks humour.

I won't be watching again. The American Office did something very unique in pulling away from the English version, but mainly on the basis the Michael Scott character is very different to the David Brent character, playing very well to the nationality of the audience. Americans love someone dumb and loveable, who always mucks it up but gets away with it in the end. The English audience love a villan, an idiot, or someone who can make them cringe. I think the cringe elements were possibly what bought Inbetweeners their fame as well.

Guess how much it cost me?
FUCKALL! well, maybe about 50p of my tax.
My 21%~ tax (that still leaves me with just under 4/5ths of my wage, for all you young matheletes) goes on all sorts. From funding the services of police, medical dudes and fire dudes..and the army, to helping keep the country running. 


I don't mind not having a gun, but i know that if i do happen to get shot, i'll get treated instantly and will not even notice the cost of it.



The ***ONLY*** downside i can see to the UK is paying for dental care. And that's just because i don't like fingers in my mouth. If it was all done with metal sticks i'd be ok, but i know there's a chance the dentist will cram a finger into my gob and make things awkward.

true,A_User,null,null,"I'm a 25 year old UK citizen who's been living in the US on a green card for that last year.

My experience with the NHS in Britain has always been excellent. Whenever I have needed to see a doctor, I have been able to see one. Immediately when necessary, and within 48 hours for lesser complaints. It never cost me a penny.

When I was a child I spent 2 weeks in the hospital with acute asthma. Again, this didn't cost a penny. In the US, my family would have been saddled with a 5 or even 6 figure debt.

Now that I am in the US, my experience with healthcare is atrocious. I cannot even TALK to a doctor for anything less than $50, and usually more than $100. A simple blood test cost me $450. I was bounced between several different doctors, charged just shy of $1000 in total, and they haven't even given me a diagnosis.

I had another issue with my asthma while I was here, and, not having an inhaler with me at the time, rushed to the ER saying 'please give me an inhaler'. In the UK, this would have been trivial. In the US, the ER wanted send me through their whole system and have me seen by their 'specialists'. I asked what this would cost. They gave me an *estimate* of $13,000. In England, no, ALL OF EUROPE, this would have cost me *nothing*, or next to nothing.

Fuck. That. I risked my life instead and sat in the car until I could breathe again.



&gt;Do you feel that your health care is adequate, that you're seen in a timely manner and that you get the services you need?

Yes.

&gt;Do you feel that your taxes are outrageously high?

No. My wages were a lot higher in the UK too. Working conditions were also better. And I had more holidays. *Paid* ones.
    
&gt;Given the opportunity would you trade places with a US citizen?

No. If it weren't for my wife I would not be in this backward, stuck-in-the-1950's hell-hole. If for any reason I end up divorced, or I find a way to get her over into the UK, I will be out of this country like a rocket.

Oh, and if my wife became a UK citizen, she would almost certainly renounce her US citizenship to avoid paying the USA's utterly absurd expat tax.

&gt;Do you feel that you have fewer freedoms (not including the obvious gun restriction) than Americans?

No. Don't make me laugh. Americans can't even drink until 21. Nor can they legally drive at a half decent speed down a straight road as wide as a football pitch. Nor can they buy fireworks easily. No going to the local corner shop for your booze and pyrotechnics - no, you must go to a dedicated, licensed vendor that is almost always in an out-of-the-way location. This 'land of the free' notion is 200 years out of date. The rest of western civilization has passed them by and they do not even realize it.

&gt;Do you feel that you are ""over regulated"" to the point of stifling businesses?

But if you think about River's timeline, she and the Doctor aren't meeting in opposite directions so much as in a completely random order. There's a drawing of their meetings that looks like a giant spiderweb. Like - when the Doctor finds out who River is at Demon's run, they've barely begun a relationship, and the next time he sees her is the first time River meets HIM in Let's Kill Hitler. If their timelines were linear, that would have been the last time the Doctor would have seen her and he would have been very in love with her at that point, but we know for a fact that isn't true.

So I think when River meets a doctor that doesn't know her, she WORRIES that it could possibly be the last time she sees him but doesn't know for sure. Afterall, River could have seen an older doctor after that ""last kiss"" moment in storm cage, she just didn't know that she would.

I want the double right back thing because they play more down the left, with both Pienaar and Baines being their main sources of creativity, and having Walker up against Leighton makes me feel much better. Lennon can do plenty of work on the left, and looks better than Bale on the right. Him running at Everton's defense, (any of them besides Baines) should be a big threat. Jan at LB and Ade up front to A) help with the completely scrappy, hard fought point(s) this match will surely be, and B) to help shut down that fucking man mountain at set pieces. As hot as Defoe is right now, this is not the game for him. We cannot afford for him to go missing for 20 minute stretches in a fixture like this one. 

That being said, I'll assume there isn't a chance in hell this happens, so I'd spring for Lennon on the right, Clint on the left, and Gylfi down the middle.

true,87liyamu,uk,North-East Derbyshire,"&gt;Do you feel that your health care is adequate, that you're seen in a timely manner and that you get the services you need?

I'm fortunate enough to have never needed to use the NHS personally. I have friends and family that make regular use of NHS services, however, and their complaints are generally applicable to all health services in the developed world. Excessive administration, long waits, etc.

People will always complain about the things that are wrong with the service they're being provided with. If there's enough wrong with a system, popular demand will see it changed. That hasn't happened with the NHS. In fact, popular demand typically calls for more of the same. The NHS is doing a good enough job for all politicians to support it.

If your mother is likely at all to be persuaded by charts and figures, you'd do well to show her a few reports from the [King's Fund](http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/) charity. Here is a [25-page quarterly report on how the NHS is performing](http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/files/kf/field/field_publication_file/how-is-the-nhs-performing-quarterly-monitoring-report-sept12.pdf). This report focuses on perceptions and optimism for the future, with some data concerning treatment of *C difficile* and *MRSA*. There's also a much more in-depth [80-page report](http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/files/kf/field/field_publication_file/health-policy-under-the-coalition-government-kingsfund-nov2012.pdf) which looks at the Coalition's record on Healthcare. This document deals much more directly with how things are, and contains extensive references to external documents for further reading. Read this and the associated reports, and you'll likely have a better understanding of how the NHS is doing than any Brit!

&gt;Do you feel that your taxes are outrageously high?

As /u/WobbleWagon has already said, taxes aren't outrageously high, but there is concern that taxes aren't being spent in the best way. In March, the Guardian produced [this graph](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/21/1332343666628/Budget-2012-tax-and-spend-001.jpg) showing how the British Government spends what it raises in taxes, and where that money comes from. You can see from this that the largest area of expenditure is *Social protection* - roughly analogous to *Welfare spending* in the United States - which costs £207bn annually. Applying a quick formula (dividing by the population of 61m, and dividing again by 365), we can calculate that this costs on average £9.45 per person per day.

Of course, citizens of every country will always have concerns over how their taxes are being spent, this is not unique to the United Kingdom. Personally, I feel that I'm taxed in a fair manner, and I'm grateful for the services that are provided to me through taxation.

&gt;Given the opportunity would you trade places with a US citizen?

Ah, well that depends on the US citizen. I'd swap places with an affluent straight white male in an instant. But one of the [estimated 1.5million homeless Americans](http://www.ich.gov/PDF/OpeningDoors_2010_FSPPreventEndHomeless.pdf)? Or one of the [10% of African American men currently in prison](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129379700)? No, thanks.

As for swapping with an American in my own position - I don't imagine I'd see much difference. The promise of ""becoming an American"" holds no appeal for me as a middle-class white male Briton, so I'd probably stick with what I know.

&gt;Do you feel that you have fewer freedoms (not including the obvious gun restriction) than Americans?

Good question! I'd say I probably have more freedoms than the average American in my own position. While I may be caught on CCTV a lot of the time, and my Oyster Card lets the Government track my location, and all the other Orwellian nightmare ""facts"" that I live with every day.. none of these things hinder me. Money permitting, I'm free to do pretty much anything that I choose to do, provided it doesn't infringe on the rights of others.

There are examples, of course, of one person's rights interfering with the rights of another. Many of these issues are covered under [Section 5 of the Public Order Act](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/5), which it designed to protect people from ""threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour"". There is, however, a [movement calling for the reform of this bill](http://reformsection5.org.uk/), with growing support.

&gt;Do you feel that you are ""over regulated"" to the point of stifling businesses?

Reminds me of how they done the remake for The Office, the first season was basically a copy cat of the British series but the second season spread its wings a bit differently and it turned into a major success.

I think the lesson there is that trying to emulate like that is a bad idea, but if an idea can be truly translated to different audiences (awkward teens, the fun of an office and in the case of Shameless' successful remake, working class family drama) then they should be more original with the idea.

I see a lot of complaints about insurance companies in the US not paying for newer drugs because of the expense. My daughter's on a high dosage of three drugs with a lower supplemental dosage of two others. I know for a fact there'd be a quibble about her getting Keppra and most definitely at the dosage she's on. Also Lamictal is another of the newer more expensive AEDs. 

I dread to think how we'd manage if we lived in the US, particularly as I'm a single parent and had to give up work to care for her. I don't have to worry here in the UK. We get to see the neurologist every 3 months and if we have any concerns we're referred on for further investigation no matter what the cost. My mind is at ease knowing all of this, which is always a great help whenever you've ill health to worry about. 

I could also mention I have a niece with a cochlear implant (done on the national health of course) and she's either lost or damaged the transmitter/microphone numerous times (I think we're on her 10th or 11th about now, she's not overly careless it's part of her condition being forgetful and slightly clumsy)... It's extremely costly to replace but she's always received a new one, no problem... The cost for the implant in the UK is £25,000 but as quoted from the American Academy of Otorhinolaryngology, the cost of the surgery/implant in the US is $100,000.

After the retirement of King, the trade of VdV and Modric, and the massive injuries of Kaboul, BAE, and Parker, and the weird injuries, employment status, and penalties to Power Horse, only 3 of our starters (Bale, Lennon, Walker) have held their position from season to season.

And before you fuss at me:

* Friedel started most PL fixtures this year, but Lloris is our man now
* Sandro played a lot last year, but Parker was our starter

AVB was handed a shit sandwich with this squad's situation, and had to cobble together a winning team with basically 3 just wide players and goalkeeper from last season.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"The seventh Doctor is my favorite. I told myself when I started watching classic many months ago that I wouldn't pick a favorite. I wanted to love all the Doctors. And I do. But the seventh has stolen my heart.

He's got a dry humor with a dark Time Lord power underneath, and of course, a kickass companion: Ace. Their relationship is so unique, it's a tag-team ""you do the talking, I do the walking"" with 7 as a sort of stand-in parent/guide and tutor. Yet at the same time, it's almost, if you want to put on the goggles, romantic. But because of the tutor/guide thing and 7's distant otherness, it's very platonic.

And by dark Time Lord power I mean that during the seventh Doctor's era you got the feeling that while the seventh seems like a goofy dusty professor on the outside, sometimes you can tell there's an undercurrent of something. This something is alien, it's terrifying, and it's dangerous.

But it's different from the godlike awe I get from the tenth Doctor. This is where it gets hard to explain. The tenth Doctor's godlike-ness, in my opinion, relates to his vanity. Both are very unique to the tenth Doctor (unlike the shallow narcissism of the sixth or fourth).

But the tenth Doctor makes you think that he is some kind of tragic and lonely god high above us who lives in another plane. The seventh Doctor feels more like a pervasive sense of otherness. Dark otherness. (That and it's been pointed out to me that while Tennant is a fantastic actor, he can't do ""eccentric"" to save his life despite being a master at barely-concealed-anger. McCoy has the opposite acting strength/weakness.)

Btw, this dark sense of otherness is very strong in the novel Lungbarrow. Funnily enough, he is revealed to be the Other in the novel and his cousins in the House of Prydon often wonder what the Doctor is. He's Time's Champion for one thing...

What's interesting is that I say these things about the seventh Doctor but I don't know how I reached this feeling. Probably because of the story Remembrance of the Daleks. It was my first seventh Doctor story. I think. I don't know why, but there's something compelling about his personality. It's a blend of dignity and humility, comedy and darkness.

**In retrospect** he's also an amazing Doctor (and I'm more sure he's my favorite now) because of his excellent run on Big Finish Productions' audio drama range. McCoy's stories have made me cry. Yup. And break my heart. And just recently I listened to what is, imo, the best radio drama* I've heard yet out of 200+ and it's with SEVEN.

*Despite the term ""radio drama"" it's primarily just for purchased on www.bigfinish.com (though it has been on radio). They use the original actors for Doctors and companions, have full cast with full sound. It's not people sitting and narrating. It's like tv but for your ears.

Not entirely true.

Starbucks may be in England (if it is unprofitable) to prevent other companies growing as much as they have and to keep their brand awareness up.

If you're a Starbucks customer in the UK whenever you go to another country you'll go to Starbucks, just like if you're a US person that is a customer of Starbucks and visits the UK, you'll go to Starbucks.

For me personally I want to be in a position where if my life falls apart I'm not going to be homeless and without healthcare, so I stick around and it's nice to know that I'm helping fund healthcare for people less well off than me, but it's definitely more expensive in *direct* year to year tax cost to be a UK citizen over a US citizen if you're making a good amount of income. I think this ties into how American people feel, others mentioned above that the American attitude is ""I'm a rich person temporarily poor"" so they care about how much someone on income they view as attainable is taxed.

I figure it's much much better to be poor in the UK and it's much better to be rich in the US... well, if your concern is only your own situation and you expect to be in that situation for the foreseeable future. This ties into the US thing of ""rich person that is poor temporarily""

Why is Britain such a troublesome partner if it is so marvellous for Britain to be in the EU?

Britain is a net _importer_ from the EU; you think the EU is going to want to stop trading?  They would lose more than we would.

The export market to the EU is shrinking, and has been shrinking for years.  Being trapped in the EU is making it harder (through some ridiculous EU-imposed trade barriers) for Britain to trade with the growing export markets we should be targetting: Brazil, Russia, India and China.

Free-trade is good for consumers.  The CAP and CFP are disasters for UK farmers and fishermen because they are free-trade barriers.

The article conveniently missed out the massive risk we take because we keep signing up to these rescue funds.  When Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland go pop; we're on the line to stump up funds.  For what benefit?

Ignoring selfish UK-centric thinking; the common currency is bad for the members.  Exchange rates are a safety valve for mismanagement by governments.  With your own currency, during a recession you don't have to fire anyone, they simply earn less because the currency is weaker.  When you don't have your own currency, you have to make up the shortfall with cuts.  Have a look at Spain and Greece for the effects of that.

I was actually born British, but was raised in Germany and became a German early. I visited relatives for 13 years since my birth. After a long time not being to England, I visited it this year. I was in Winchester and wanted to cross a street with a pedestrian crossing. So, as a German, I waited. Cars went through from the street I was waiting at, then cars from another direction drove through, then again from my street, etc. The pedestrian light didn't turn green. Since the time between the cars coming from the streets was long enough, I decided at some point to simply cross the street. The gentleman behind me decided to do the same and even overtook me crossing the street. It was a policeman. He didn't say a word or tried to stop me, something that would never happen in this case in Germany.

But at this point it dawned to me what's the national difference is. It's not the people, it's the traffic lights. The thing is, in Germany **they work**. I don't know if there is a regulation for traffic lights for how long a pedestrian has to wait before a light should turn green for him, but I guess there is. I almost never have the feeling I wait to long at a German traffic light. But if they would take so much time as in e.g. in England, I would just cross the street even if it's red.",0,1354875894,null,0,false,0,c7cnv15,t3_14dk1d,t1_c7cnv15,t1_c7c8d95,null,1430604472,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

""The EU removes far more regulation than it creates - hell, that's the whole point of it, and the reason that British business rallies behind the EU (unlike the UKIP loonies &amp; Empire-dreaming farmer toffs of the Tory fringe).

The EU is by far the strongest force in the world for liberal free trade. The numbers speak for themselves: EU exports to non-EU countries are 3.35 times America's, and EU imports are 2.55 times US levels (despite similar consumption levels). http://t.co/Lbh7nQBQ

The EU is presently finalising a free trade agreement with Canada that runs much deeper than NAFTA (opening up a wider range of products &amp; services, and removing far more non-tariff barriers). The EU actually has a more genuine free trade agreement with South Korea, running much deeper than America's. The EU is half way though developing a wider free trade area bringing in the whole Mediterranean area (Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Israel, Lebanon &amp; Turkey so far - perhaps Syria). In West Africa, in Southern Africa and in Eastern Europe, the EU is making bits of aid and investment finance available conditional on incremental trade opening and extension of rule of law. The EU dragged Russia into the WTO. The EU is finalising free trade with Singapore, and is about to begin deep free trade negotiations (same model as Korea - that really is radical) with Japan (pretty closed to the world for the most part, with massive price disparities &amp; arbitrage opportunities across services &amp; products - this will be awesome of we can pull it off, and fantastic for business).

And of course, the EU and US are about to enter tentative negotiations on a free trade agreement (the full launch, I gather, should happen after EU-Canada). We've deliberately build the EU-Canada free trade agreement with a new rules of origin definition, so that Canadian businesses can import from the US (tariff free under NAFTA) and re-export to the EU tariff free (providing only minimal added value in Canada). That puts enormous pressure on American businesses to lobby for US-EU free trade. So we've strategically laid the ground to force a grand compromise with the US (they talk the talk, but the US is one of the most protectionist &amp; insular developed countries out there, thanks to Congress re-writing &amp; building special interests into every trade treaty that the executive signs).

And it all shows in trade numbers and in investment patterns (the EU's international investments have grown far faster than America's, while international investments in the EU have likewise grown faster than that in America; the EU's share of world trade has remained flat despite rapid Asian growth over the past 10 years, while America's has declined rapidly).

Britain has done a fantastic job in building the EU as the world's best force for global free trade. We probably couldn't pull it off from the outside (indeed, with us on the outside, France &amp; Italy might be strong enough to corrupt what remains and stifle global progress).

British business is internationally successful (to use a big name: Tesco in South Korea &amp; Eastern Europe; but also so many small businesses like mine) thanks to the EU tearing down international regulatory barriers to trade, operation and investment.

The UK has achieved so much here - we would be foolish to leave.""",0,1354877849,null,0,false,0,c7co16m,t3_14fp50,t1_c7co16m,t3_14fp50,null,1430604546,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

""the right choice"" is an absolute statement.  Not everyone agrees with you -- also, in a democracy if ""a large portion of the electorate"" wants to keep Europe at arms length (and that large portion reaches a majority), then why isn't that exactly what the government should do?

You're making a lot of assumptions: that binary choice is in no way clear cut (and you mischaracterise it as ""without Europe"" rather than ""without the EU"", which are two very, very different things; and is again a favoured tactic of those who argue against Euroscepticism), it's more shades of grey.  That, in fact, is the central question of debates such as this.  You can't simply assume your favoured position and then use that as your argument -- that's called circular reasoning, or begging the question, and is logically invalid.

If it were true that ""with Europe"" were the clear winner, then we would observe that any country not in the EU would be a disaster.  That is manifestly not the case.  In fact, Iceland, who had a massive financial disaster, are recovering (may in fact have already recovered) far faster than any EU country.  Further, Germany, the country in the EU with the strongest economy looks to be falling backward rather than recovering.

The imagery of God within the Church and it's dogma paints the picture of an aged human being albeit with deific power. Deific power is a physical impossibility because the laws of nature and physics state that - for example - Jesus transposing matter into other matter (water into wine) and the control of energy (parting the seas) is impossible without the expenditure of vast amounts of energy to achieve those effects. Since energy in the universe is a constant (all energy is converted from one form to another, a light bulb converts electrical energy into heat and light energy, but none of that energy is ever destroyed, for example) then God or Jesus transforming matter without *somehow* moving raw energy around the universe faster than the speed of light (also an impossibility) would break those natural laws. Having discounted deific power as a life preservation device, what we're left with is (at least in image) a human being - Which cannot survive in space.

The reason of what's wrong with Poots requesting a flag debate in Stormont:

1. It's completely reactionary to what was democratically voted for Belfast City Hall
1. The flag days for City Hall were Based upon Stormonts and other buildings in the UK
1. It's completely hypocritical of Unionists to claim the flag vote was in order to cause controversy, and then create more controversy on purpose


**Re:""Culture""**

This is the biggest problem with both sides. The grossly misused definition of ""culture"" excuse means absolutely NOTHING in the grand scheme.

**Culture *isn't* absolute**. It changes.....mobiles phones are a huge part of UK culture now....did we have those in the early 20th century? 

Top hats/peak caps were once a huge part of culture here, did anyone riot on their departure?

The other reason culture is moot in a democratic society is that other cultures can contradict each other, and there's no way you can fairly take preference of one over the other.

Many Unionists are crying out ""100 years"" over the flag issue. That is an entirely flawed argument, especially when the nationalists can call out the years of celtic culture before the plantation and emergence of British rule in Ireland.

This is evident and no one is suggesting that ALL bad things are done ONLY because of religion. That's how children think.

&gt;It's not religious people that do bad things, it's people that do bad things.

Then why are ""people who do bad things"" predominantly religious in comparison to those who aren't. Roman Catholics and Muslims are significantly over represented as part of the UK prison population. Even adjusting this for social factors like poor incomes and abused children the numbers hold up. Move to the US and you won't find the irreligious in jail because there are so few. The more religious states have higher crime, divorce and abortion. You don't get utopia from removing it but isn't it strange how the most prosperous societies have very low levels of religion - [Have you ever seen a Norwegian Prison?](http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1989083,00.html)

&gt;So you're suggesting that ....blah blah blah.... contributing positive value to society?

Yes - just look at the more secular countries - they're richer, more tolerant and happier. First world religious countries have higher crime rates and incidents of child abuse, murder and corruption. 

The most religious countries in the world are not all the poorest, but they all have horrendous levels of corruption, human rights violations, economic repression and poor education.

&gt;The people targeted are not particularly bothered about British interests when British interests are having a negative effect on them. The fundamentalist nutters are likely happy enough to stay at home and do their nutty business. If it wasn't for a bunch of greedy shysters invading and exploiting them, you'd never hear anything about them.


Are you fucking serious? Is that your morality? Millions of people can be brutually murdered but so long as my conscience is clean, you don't care, out of sight, out of mind. You're the type of person who kept intervention out of Rwanda when a million people were being hacked to death in the streets. 

Again, I'm not trying to nitpick your comment, I disagree with everything on it. Britain is disrupting Taliban power which in turn disrupts the level of influence it has in Pakistan. The Haqqani's are targeting [civillians and local people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haqqani_network#Activities) and doing so is inexcusable. You might try and justify their destruction by saying we did it first, well if so attacking our millitary may be legitimate, but not random targets in Kabul, or kidnappings of journalists. If we were to withdraw right now, the consequences for the Afghan people would be dire, it would be a betrayal of every loyal Afghan policeman and soldier that has trained and fought alongside us. Every man, woman and child who through being bystanders suffered terrible injuries who we have then airlifted at our own cost to Camp Bastion and saved with emergency surgery and care. Every well, school,  road, dam and everything else we have built and protected would have been for nothing. 


But to say we should leave them to their reign of murder and brutality, where children can [be shot for going to school](http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/10/13/243514.html), where the taliban are responsible for 3 to 4 times the amount of [civillian casualties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban#Terrorism_against_civilians), bombing supermarkets to murder [human rights commisioners](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/world/asia/30kabul.html), or any of the things they committed in their [bloody rise to power, their bloody grip on power or the power they seek to regain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban's_rise_to_power).

But no, some pathetically naive socialist in the UK doesn't want to have any killing in the world. Can't we just force them peacefully? Well we could try using trade embargoes, but you think that's wrong as well because people may die. So basically the only weapon we have left is some twat in a suit giving a statement condemning them on the ten o'clock news. But as Afghan girls are shot, hung or beaten up, you can sleep easy because we aren't involved. 

The West comprises some of the largest, most dynamic, successful and wide ranging cultures, economies and civilizations on the planet. Anything we do will affect the rest of the world in a profound way. The game we are playing doesn't have an option of staying out of it. We have and always will have a responsibility to the world that we have created. If a nation can't take care of itself, then we should be the ones to help it. I'd far rather Nato soldiers helped me in that position than say the substantially less moral Pakistani troops, or Russian troops, or Iranian troops or any other.

The only regime left is subjective Bayesian statistics which you are clearly employing.  Thankfully, subjective Bayesian statistics is not taken seriously unless the assertions made are eventually backed by evidence.

You have no data to assign a frequentist probability.
A priori you have no way to objectively quantify a chance of God's existence, nor do you have any evidence to back subjective assertions of God's existence, so you can't assign a bayesian probability.

So don't even bother mentioning probability or statistics.  If you can't assign one, or prescribe away you could possibly do so, then don't even bother trying to disagree that a God's existence is improbable.

true,B4mf0rth,null,null,"We are hardly a global murder operation. Lets look briefly at where British Army has been engaged over the last thirty years. 

1. Falklands 1982 - Justifiable war, Argentina attacked first in order to prop up the failing government. We took our territory back, as per the will of the local inhabitants. 

2. First Gulf War 1991: Justifiable war,  part of a UN-authorised force which pushed Saddam back out of Kuwait. 

3. Bosnia 1993: Justifiable war, part of another UN authorised peacekeeping force there to stop the systematic genocides being committed by the various factions. 

4. Kosovo 1998/99: Justified on humanitarian grounds. Admittedly the bombing was controversial but justifiable on the grounds that ending the conflict quickly using force was clearly going to involve significantly less civilian casualties than the long drags of diplomacy would have allowed to happen. 

5. Sierra Leone 2000: Justifiable, particularly nasty civil war, British soldiers deployed to rescue various civilians and act as peacekeepers. Hardly murderous intentions. 

6. Afghanistan 2001 and Iraq 2003, we already know we have differing views, so we will leave them. 

But in any case, out of 7 major conflicts in the past 30 years, 5 have been justified and enacted well. The other two are questionable, but I certainly believe our particular conduct in Afghanistan has been commendable and hardly imperialist. 

So to say we are bloodthirsty imperialists when the vast majority of what we do is completely justified by the UN is unfair to say the least. So considering war is thoroughly unpleasant at the best of times, and looking at other millitaries around the world, British military moral conduct is actually pretty good.

The one you need to look at is the 4 years + statistic which is where all the serious criminals are.

No - Muslims are predominantly Asian and of Indian and Pakistani decent. There's nearly 2 million in the UK (as opposed to 1.4m Blacks Caribbean and Africans).

&gt; it's a world thing that a large number of black people are incarcerated

I have no idea what you mean by this. The largest group of people in prison are White Anglicans (40%). People of ""no religion"" represent 30%. ESS and BSA surveys both show that between 49-55% of the UK population are of ""no religion"".

And don't forget the 4392 child abusers currently serving in the catholic church who are not in prison.

There are Asian/Black atheists too.
Race has little to do with those numbers.

I don't give a shit what you do in the bedroom (or pretty much anywhere within reason) so long as it's consensual.

Do you really think having the power to make trade deals with other countries and not having to pay for the EU would weaken the economy?

&gt;leave us in a weird position of having to renegotiate into the single market because we truly need it.

Negotiate that before we leave.

&gt;as part of this negotiation we would have to pay into the EU budget like Norway

Significantly less then we do now.

&gt;Alternatively go for a switzerland model with the discrete clause that if we ever denied what the EU said they could cut all relations

The EU has as much to lose from this as we do.

&gt;have less international power (US wants UK in the EU, not only that but a single european foreign policy is probably the strongest force in the world if you dont include the US military).

We would have more international power as a sovereign state. What you really mean is that the EU will have less power.

Europe never has Britain's interests at heart. Look at the Turbot War for an example of what European policy will really be like. A federal Europe would have no national vetoes and we would have no say to oppose them the next time they decide to go around bullying our real allies.

What the US wants is irrelevant quite frankly. The US should have no say in our relationship with Europe.

&gt;Remove any democratic legitimacy the EU had by forcing us to cooperate without representation (although they will spin this as 'regaining control of our country [bullshit]').

What legitimacy does it have now? All I see is Europe trying to shit on our country at every chance it gets. Banking taxes, budget increases, farming subsidies, shale gas bans, ecotaxes, regulation on the shape of cucumbers, forced metric measurements, boardroom quotas for women, etc.

Don't even get me started on the ECHR which seems hell bent on destroying our criminal justice system.

Yup.

The American DMCA recognises this and has a specific process to handle this problem. Laws in other countries rely on more vague concepts such as perceived intent. Google makes efforts to minimise the amount of infringing material it links to.

Was O'Dwyer really not aware that a fair proportion of the material was going to be posted without the copyright holder's permission? If you believe that he was I have a bridge to sell you. Did he make any efforts to prevent this from happening? 

&gt; There is a huge difference in hosting to providing a link - if you're hosting you are actively distributing the copyrighted material, whereas if you are providing a link you are merely making a source of copyrighted material known.

The charge is facilitating the distribution of the material. A link is more than making the presence of something known. It's a specifically formatted piece of data designed to make accessing the material as easy as possible. It's not like the fact that a browser would go directly there was a mere accident.

These are pointlessly dismissive statements, so I'm not going to bother argueing against them.

&gt;Westminster has more Scottish MP's than Europe has Scottish MEP's

This is a fairly obvious fact - only 100 more represantatives for 450,000,000 more people.

&gt;You cannot claim you feel you're not reaching your potential in the UK when you're whoring yourself out to a body that encouraged federalisation.

You keep saying Scotland is whoring itself out to the EU. I really can't tell if you hate Scotland or just the idea of the breakup of the UK and the existance of the EU. Either way, what we get from the EU in Scotland is considered by many in Scotland to be very beneficial to us. While opinions are mixed, we don't feel as strongly as many English people, so stating that we are 'whoring ourselves out' is not a statement I imagine you'd find a lot of support for up here.

&gt;And how do you plan on avoiding new laws from the EU that 20+ other states agree with but harm your national interest?

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"While you are entitled to your opinions and beliefs, thankfully, we have science which doesn't care about them. It is only controversial to people unwilling to accept the scientific community's consensus. It is a bit like the theory of evolution, it is nigh on impossible to prove without a doubt, but the peer-reviewed evidence points that way, regardless of your personal beliefs.

Also, you assume that the carbon tax is just a punishment against corporations for polluting. That isn't the point at all. There are a lot of long term benefits of the tax that have nothing to do with climate change. Two big ones that I can think of:

1. Whether or not we are causing climate change, it is still a fact that we are running out of oil. And the only places we can get it are pretty exploitive about selling it to us. This carbon tax is a way of getting airlines, who are the customers of aircraft and engine manufactures (one of which I work for) to really, really push for more efficient engines. We get masses of investment put into improving technology for efficient engines. This reduces our reliance on overpriced fuel from other countries and also means that further down the line, as fuel gets more and more expensive, airlines everywhere will look to our aircraft industry to sell them awesomely efficient engines! We are already doing pretty well in this regard - the aircraft engine manufacturing industry (you probably know the company I'm talking about) in the UK is one of the few successful manufacturing industries remaining and it employs thousands of factory workers who become very skilled, high tech labour. We're talking assembling engines here, not toys.

2. The tax doesn't go into the black hole (well it's not supposed to anyway, but that's a different topic). It is supposed to be used to subsidise the development of renewable energies and the like. Sure, these things like wind and solar power are fucking expensive and fucking inefficient for the moment. But as I said before, let's completely ignore the environment for a moment, fuck that hippie shit. We're still going to run out of oil/gas(/coal to a much lesser extent) eventually. Until then, it is only getting more expensive to run those old fossil fuel plant for us and everyone else on this planet. We take this tax money and we plow it into the UK renewable energy research and manufacturing industry. We end up far outpacing the yanks, Chinese and everyone else on making high efficiency, low cost wind turbines and solar panels. In a few years, we start exporting that stuff like crazy. PROFIT! Unlike the reserves of oil and gas, the demand for renewable energy will never, ever diminish. Not only do we end up with a fantastically advanced energy industry, manufacturing and exporting energy solutions to everyone else, we find out that we've also managed to align a large proportion of our labour force into researching and manufacturing this kind of high tech, difficult-to-copy (the more complicated and high tech your manufacturing methods, the more difficult it is for someone to copy) product. That's how we get an economy based on good solid manufacturing that pays well and doesn't create massive inequality or piss itself whenever there's a stock market shock (a la our lovely financial industry at the moment).

**TL,DR:** Forget climate change, fossil fuels are expensive and we have to buy it off asshole countries. Carbon taxes reallocate investment into **local** industries that reduce our fuel usage and develop a highly skilled research and manufacturing workforce. Then when the other countries realise they're running out of fuel too, we can sell our high-tech stuff to them for **MAD PROFIT!!**

Seems very likely that he knew it was posted without the copyright holder's permission, but as he, himself, was not hosting the files I don't see why he should take the blame. If anything, the copyright holders should have used his website to find the websites actually breaking their copyright and taken them down. 

I imagine a number of companies use Google to search for websites that distribution their copyrighted works so that they can find which websites they need to go after.

&gt;The charge is facilitating the distribution of the material. A link is more than making the presence of something known. It's a specifically formatted piece of data designed to make accessing the material as easy as possible. It's not like the fact that a browser would go directly there was a mere accident.

Yes, that is the charge and I don't think that is a real crime; it was an index for where to find places which were committing crimes, though. Would it also be illegal to post maps online of where to find drug dealers?

2. Saddam invaded Kuwait. We pushed him out of Kuwait. No occupation, Saddam was allowed to retain power. 

3. Hardly. If the lack of UN authorisation plays a part in why Iraq is unjustified then the presence of UN authorisation has to play a part in why Bosnia was justified. 

4. Simply not true, the bombing helped end a conflict quickly that could have turned extremely nasty. Yes unfortunately civillians died, but given the number that would have died if we did nothing, it was justifiable.

5. fair enough, we'll leave it.

6. I clearly said it was because we already know we disagree on whether they were justified so theres no point me trying to justify them to you again when I know you won't be convinced. Iraq society is hardly in disarray, in fact its doing rather well. The general death rate is at its lowest since 2003, democratic government of a sort is in place, the US millitary has left and Iraqi troops and police are doing a good job. 

And I started with the Falklands because the army then and the army now are fairly comparable. The further back you go towards national service and world war two, the role the British military and government played gets more and more different and less comparable. It was a very different world back then. So applying the morality of today to the actions committed in the face of Nazism and Communism is unfair.

Which will cost flyers, the customers of flights, more money.

So wouldn't this be an incentive for ""more efficient engines"" and not some European tax?

A lot of people seem to think the EU is naive but if britain did leave I think you'd find negotiating all the good bits while leaving out the bad bits wouldn't go down so well in brussels.

The EU is a place with over 500 million people currently. You think we have them hanging from a string? No, we don't. 

Of course europe has britain's interests at heart. Why don't you look at the falklands as an example rather than some fishing scandal. 

And the legitimacy it has now? We elect MEPs who approve laws from the commission. The commission is elected by national governments to write laws, like any commission in the UK is put forward whether it be judiciary or whatever. The parliament can strike down a law at will if it wants. Just by naming a bunch of laws you cannot write off the democratic legitimacy it has. It could be better, but that doesn't mean it is non existant.

&gt;Prank radio station 2Day FM is already serving two five-year licence probations after serious breaches of the regulator's code, it emerged yesterday.

&gt;The broadcaster was handed the first reprimand in 2009 after a 14-year-old girl was attached to a lie detector and pushed into revealing live on air that she had been raped.

&gt;The reluctant teenager had been brought on to The Kyle and Jackie O Show by her mother who told the presenters she was worried about her daughter's use of drugs and partying.

&gt;The mother asked her daughter: 'Have you ever had sex?'

&gt;To which, she replied: 'I’ve already told you the story about this ... and don’t look at me and smile because it’s not funny'.

&gt;After a pause, the girl added: 'Oh OK, I got raped when I was 12 years old.'

We know she was the butt of a big practical joke, and then one assumes that people at work were really hard on her, made her feel like a fool, like she had made an awful error and put people in danger, maybe that she would lose her job, you know, really piled it on, made her feel like a right idiot, - and plus if she is the kind of person to have killed herself over this, one imagines her all shy and timid and slight before any of this even happened.

You make it sound as if people who commit suicide are people with various problems that they can't deal with, and that eventually they snap and kill themselves.  Granted, that does happen, but at this stage there is no reason to believe this is the case with her.  It also makes it sound like it's an excuse and OK i.e. ""oh well, she killed herself.  Probably had other reasons, so let's move on"".  In stead of expressing sympathy for her family and colleagues, all you are doing is insinuating that she had possible mental health issues, or problems she couldn't deal with anymore.  

Not everyone that commits suicide has insurmountable problems.  In her case, she may have felt deeply embarrassed, or that she let people down.  **And depending on her personality**, that could have been enough for her to kill herself. 

Don't make excuses for the DJs.  Yes, it's a prank, but this is exactly why you need to be cautious who you prank.  Pranks work best on those you know, because you know how they are likely to react.  Don't prank strangers.  

And even if she did have various problems, that is even a bigger reason not to randomly prank someone, because you don't know what is happening in their lives, and you don't know how they will react.  

I hope the DJs will have a great weekend.  They have lots to think about.   ",0,1354896218,null,0,1354898736,0,c7cqvfp,t3_14g0it,t1_c7cqvfp,t3_14g0it,null,1430605947,32,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,32

Put yourself in her position, which you already seem to have done, but stop concluding that the prank callers are to blame in any way. 

It was a fucking joke, and any managerial staff that made her feel like she was stupid or naive are the cunts here.

**Edit**

I'll add some more explanation. We often talk of a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"". It's a useful tool in settling legal disputes which are not black and white. In the case of prank calling, I see no reason why we can't talk of a ""reasonable expectation that the recipient would see the funny side and wouldn't take it to heart"". 

I really feel that if she hadn't committed suicide then we'd all be exchanging laughs and giggles over the YouTube video in another thread. This is a ridiculous double standard. 

Here's an example. If you drink-drive, get caught but don't kill anyone, the punishment and condemnation you receive are far less than if you drink-drive, get caught but do kill someone. To me, the two situations are indistinguishable morally. There is ample evidence that when you drink-drive you put others at huge danger. Thus I'd condemn both equally.

With prank calls, there is no evidence that prank calls put the recipient at huge danger. It's simply not expected. Everyone knows drink-driving is dangerous, few would consider prank calls to be dangerous. So in this case, where a prank call has caused someone to commit suicide, we should still occupy the single standard that the act of prank calling was not morally wrong. Much like with drink-driving, the outcome should not change our view of the act itself.

We might revise our view that prank calls are harmless but we should recognise that these DJs had, as I call it, a ""reasonable expectation that the recipient would see the funny side and wouldn't take it to heart.""",0,1354896248,null,0,1354897709,0,c7cqvoy,t3_14g0it,t1_c7cqvoy,t1_c7cqio9,null,1430605951,33,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,33

It has been suggested that the DJ's who orchestrated this prank must have known that in the event of it being successful someone could lose their job. My guess is that they simply didn't think that far ahead, that they weren't really thinking at all. Clearly they too made a mistake and they will have to live with that.

You might not, but the vast majority of the outrage I'm seeing about this is due to the fact he was ""targeting students"" and that nobody quite seems to comprehend that these woman willingly went to bed with him. He is really no different to a guy on a friday night who talks a women into his bed and then she wakes up and realizes everything he said was bollocks.

It's sloppy because there is clearly no rigour or actual want to understand what might be the root of an issues just an assumptions about their cause.

No that's bollocks. What's wrong is a work ethic in which someone duped by a prank call would ever be punished. What was she to do? Laugh and say ""No, you're not the Queen"" and put down the phone? 

Put yourself in her position, which you already seem to have done, but stop concluding that the prank callers are to blame in any way. 

It was a fucking joke, and any managerial staff that made her feel like she was stupid or naive are the cunts here.

**Edit**

I'll add some more explanation. We often talk of a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"". It's a useful tool in settling legal disputes which are not black and white. In the case of prank calling, I see no reason why we can't talk of a ""reasonable expectation that the recipient would see the funny side and wouldn't take it to heart"". 

I really feel that if she hadn't committed suicide then we'd all be exchanging laughs and giggles over the YouTube video in another thread. This is a ridiculous double standard. 

Here's an example. If you drink-drive, get caught but don't kill anyone, the punishment and condemnation you receive are far less than if you drink-drive, get caught but do kill someone. To me, the two situations are indistinguishable morally. There is ample evidence that when you drink-drive you put others at huge danger. Thus I'd condemn both equally.

With prank calls, there is no evidence that prank calls put the recipient at huge danger. It's simply not expected. Everyone knows drink-driving is dangerous, few would consider prank calls to be dangerous. So in this case, where a prank call has caused someone to commit suicide, we should still occupy the single standard that the act of prank calling was not morally wrong. Much like with drink-driving, the outcome should not change our view of the act itself.

We might revise our view that prank calls are harmless but we should recognise that these DJs had, as I call it, a ""reasonable expectation that the recipient would see the funny side and wouldn't take it to heart.""

**If these DJs are morally reprehensible then so is Dom Jolly. Surely there was a tiny risk he could have given a poor old lady a heart attack in one of his TV shows? Yes, but it's so unlikely that we take it as a negligible risk and proceed for humour's sake. Not everything funny is 100% watertight-harmless. I'm not suggesting we should intentionally put people in harm's way for the sake of comedy, just that it is sometimes and unexpected consequence. Moral relativism, apply it.**",0,1354898534,null,0,false,0,c7crg4d,t3_14g0it,t1_c7crg4d,t1_c7cr0m9,null,1430606234,25,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,25

But you keep making assumptions about the nature of billions of people based on the perception that you've gathered from our news media.... there's clearly nothing wrong there at all!

So what you saying is the social worker is an idiot who's falling for the same crap you are.

true,Antagony,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire Pudding,"I wonder how many people busy directing vitriol at these Aussie DJs have actually listened to the broadcast. They were terrible impressions and they made very little effort to sound realistic. They also threw in lots of silly little ""comedy"" asides, that I believe were intended to tip-off the person on the other end of the phone that it was just a prank – as I think half of the ""fun"" (for people who like this kind of thing) is the reaction of the victim when the truth dawns on them. Sadly, she sounded so nervous at even the idea of speaking to the Queen, that she was clearly too flummoxed to realise it. 

I think those Aussie DJs must be feeling absolutely terrible right now, but, like you, I think it is utterly absurd to blame them entirely for this poor woman's tragic death. No doubt someone at the hospital felt it was necessary to give her a severe dressing down for her mistake. I bet they're feeling just as awful right now too. And I can't help but wonder if she was maybe pursued by gutter press journalists once the story broke. And, if so, whether those so-called journalists feel any of the responsibility for what has happened now. For some reason I somehow doubt it!

**Edit:** I've just realised this wasn't the nurse who gave out the information and talked at length with the DJs, but the one who initially answered the phone and passed it over. So she probably wouldn't have been the one receiving a severe dressing down at the hospital. But maybe she was blamed for believing the call initially and telling the other nurse it was the Queen?
