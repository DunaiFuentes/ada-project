2. DW is the longest running sci- fi series in the world. It started in 1963 with ""An Unearthly Child"", introducing William Hartnell as the first Doctor (although there is some discussion if this was really his first regeneration). The Doctor is an alien from a planet called Gallifrey. He has a time/space machine, the TARDIS, which stands for ""Time and Relative Dimension in Space"". The Tardis looks like a blue police box from the 1960's. Originally it had the ability to change it's appearance to resemble items (statues, cars...) from the time it was in, using the ""Cameleon Circuit"", but that is broken, so it never changes (see the first ever episode for that). The TARDIS is bigger on the inside, which is always good for some comic relief.

The Doctor was exiled from his home planet, for what reason is not really known. As the Doctor travels through all of time and space, he likes to pick up companions. Mostly they are female, young and pretty ;) He really likes to show off to them, although that is a trait that is more obvious in some incarnations than others. He is incredibly smart, and hates violence of any kind. His weapon of choice is his sonic screwdriver, a gadget that can upon many things open doors and disarm weapons,...

He also has some bad traits (he really sounds like a superhero in the previous paragraph, doesn't he? :). Most of all, he is lonely and sad, and his past makes him something of a warrior. But for the whole canon, you should really watch the show.

If the Doctor dies, only the actor changes. The change in actors is explained by regeneration. As the Doctor is an alien, he has the ability to change appearances. He doesn't have to die, he can willingly change into another person, but even if his memories stay the same, the person and with it all of the personal traits and the character completely change. Apparently it is not a pleasant thing, regeneration, and is not something a Time Lord would do willingly (Time Lord being the doctor's race.)

If you want to start watching DW, IMO you should watch the reboot from 2005 first, finish that and then, if you miss it very much, as you probably will, watch the original series. Don't start with the original series, it takes somewhat of a real fan to get used to the change of pace. New Who, or TV shows in general nowadays are much faster in terms of storytelling, compared to Classic Who. (Classic Who stories that are really awesome are ""The Tomb of the Cybermen"" and ""Inferno"") Unfortunately, very few of the first and second Doctor's episodes remain in full, most of the archived footage was destroyed in a flood or taped over.

If you watched the reboot and then the classic series, you will stumble upon some familiar faces. Trust me, it will be awesome!! Also geat if you miss DW- Torchwood. It is a spinoff series starring Captain Jack Harkness, the sexy sexy Captain (""Oh Captain, my Captain!"") you will get to know in New Who in Series 1.

Prepare for crying of laughter, crying because they hit you right in the feels, and being soooo angry but simultaniuosly in love with Stephen Moffat (producer and head writer) because he is just a goddamn awesome stupid genious bastard.

Have fun, i hope this helps.

This group of organisms, traditionally referred to as ""normal flora"" contribute to our existence in several ways:

* Help us by competing with pathogens such as Salmonella 
* Help us by providing vitamins or eliminating toxins (e.g. Bacteroides) 
* Harm us by promoting disease (e.g. dental caries) 
* Cause neither help nor harm (e.g. ""commensals""). 

One of the most important functions of our normal flora is to protect us from highly pathogenic organisms. For example, in a normal (bacterially inhabited animal), about 10^6 Salmonella must be ingested in order to cause disease. However, when an animal has been maintained in a sterile environment all of its life (a ""gnotobiotic"" animal), the same level of disease can be produced by as few as 10 Salmonella.

If UK citizen’s are being threatened and having their business ruined, then of course we should use our military clout to protect them.

&gt;It's interesting because ""Ahmadinejad himself has repeatedly said that his remark was misinterpreted. Dan Meridor, Israel's Deputy Prime Minister, has also stated that it was not what Ahmadinejad said."". It's also ironic because Israel is helping wipe out the Palestinians and are very keen to take Lebanon (hence the clandestine activity in Syria). The Gaza flotilla was an interesting event. I don't have to rely on bastardised and sensationalised quotes to create a picture of a violent Israel. But if I wanted, I can find some quotes from lobbyists and other similar types tied to Israeli. What sticks out the most is this gem from Fox favourite Pam Geller because it actually mentioned nuking Europe out of spite:

I wasn’t aware that one man’s interpretation of a speech makes it the valid translation. Even if it was an innocent misunderstanding, the speech writers would have known it could be interpreted as a threat, making Iran look either incompetent or clearly making a threat on the sly.

Let’s just put our blinkers on and ignore all the acts of aggression by Iran this year. It says a lot about someone’s character that they would rather defend a fascist, brutal regime, over the only liberal democracy in the middle east.

Theres' little reason even respiratory problems should stop you from attending uni unless you need 24/7 care.

From there, go to your accommodation office and  look for people looking to share. Alternatively ask estate agents in the area, or look online. (Gumtree, craigslist etc).

It seems to me that living with your dad is a massive problem, gtfo out of the ASAP.


Edit: looks like you posted on my deleted thread...lol
Edit2: Grammar, spelling.


Furthermore, look into Couchsurfing or uber cheap rentals in the nearest town/city - anything to get away from what you called 'emotional blackmail'. 

You are your own person, an adult, if you feel you have to leave, LEAVE.

Without any money at all, moving can be next to impossible - however, uni provides an excellent way to escape both physically and mentally. A fresh start can be a good thing. Have you considered perhaps switching unis?

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","Several reasons why it isn't enough in itself:

 * You may not be aware that a particular weapon is lethal when used the way you use it. For example, you may think that knives only kill if you slit someone's throat; you'd be wrong, but that moves it to GBH or manslaughter rather than attempted murder or murder.

 * You might not have intended to use it on a person; if you carry a gun that you wave around to intimidate people, and that you plan to fire at the ground to scare people, you didn't intend to kill. If you miss and hit someone who's lying down in the chest, you probably will kill them, but it wasn't deliberate, let alone premeditated; it's still, however, criminal, as you should reasonably have predicted their death (so manslaughter at an absolute minimum).

 * You might have carried the weapon out of a misguided sense of self-defence; if you only intended to use it if someone attacked you, and only to protect yourself, you might not have intended to kill.

 * You might not have intended to use any weapons in this encounter; if you're carrying a carving knife from home to leave with your mother, but get into a fight en-route and use it (even if you started the fight), you didn't intend to kill, and so murder is inappropriate.

 * You might have thought that you were skilled enough with the weapon to use it in a non-lethal fashion, and just proven yourself wrong. Again, no intention to kill, so murder is the wrong charge.

 * You may have used a dual-purpose device as a lethal weapon - a car is an example. If you didn't mean to kill with it, but got enraged and drove at someone, should that be murder or manslaughter?

I'm sure there are others; with that all said, there's a reason why GBH has the same maximum penalty as murder. You may not have set out with an intention to kill (as required for murder), but if you could reasonably have been expected to know that your actions would lead to a death, you can face the same penalty as murder.",0,1350312334,null,0,false,0,c6mqwcd,t3_11i94i,t1_c6mqwcd,t1_c6mppg2,null,1430152792,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

&gt;""Five of my friends got pregnant to get a house last year and they’re 15 and 16 – it’s the only way to get anywhere"" - Will you be asking her for videos as well?

Yet, she didn't actually have a child. So, how could that possibly support your argument.

&gt;""I was that girl who thought having a baby would give me a family unit and a house and a life.""

That does not say a 16 year old got pregnant to get a council home. It says a girl got pregnant for a ""family unit and house for life"". The 27 year old woman then goes on to say,

""That’s how a lot of young people feel. I hated school and I had a difficult home life. Now it’s amazing to go into schools and have people listen to me.

""When you start, you always get these girls who sit there saying they want a baby, that they’ll get benefits and a house and stuff.

""We go through what money they’ll get and how much babies and bills cost, and what it’s like, and by the end they’ve changed their minds.""

So again, no that does not support your argument.

&gt;If claiming that having unprotected sex at the age of 12 was ""the smartest thing I ever did"" doesn't classify it as deliberate then I doubt nothing will.

How does a 12 year old girl admitting to having unprotected sex mean that she wanted to get pregnant to get a council home? Again, no support for your argument here.

&gt;Pregnant twice by the age of 15. You can argue that once could be a mistake, but there's definitely an ulterior motive with it happening twice.

Again, absolutely no support whatsoever for your argument.

First off, welcome to Edinburgh when you get here!

You have a few options. I'm assuming from the link you posted that you're female (correct me if I'm wrong though!) so as a woman with a ridiculous Mary Poppins handbag I tend to always carry an umbrella. A sturdy, foldable one. You can pick one up in Marks and Spencer or Boots once you're over here. Take it everywhere you go :) Not useless, especilly if your coat doesn't have a hood.

I was going to say get one coat for your stay rather than a snow jacket AND a wet-weather one, but if you already have one coat which'll keep out the cold then kudos. Bring some thermals. I still wear the ones I bought in Hobart every Christmas here. 

In terms of wet weather coats, I'd recommend one with a hood definitely (not much point without) and as for length, I tend to go for longer ones (that cover my bum) so that if forced to sit on a bench/chair/bus stop perch either during or after rain/snow, I don't get a wet arse. It's personal preference. 

If you were being REALLY clever, you'd go to one of the charity shops (opp shops like Vinnies) once you get here, Oxfam, Capability Scotland, Heart Foundation etc - either on Morningside Road on the southside, or Stockbridge, both of which often sell second-hand, high-quality, warm, waterproof coats for men and women at reasonable prices (more reasonable than buying new) - this way you don't have to lug coats overseas with you either.

PS - Regular old traditional soap offer much of the benefits of anti-bacterial soaps with none of the draw-backs. They do kill less bacteria.   ",0,1350316302,null,0,false,0,c6mru8m,t3_11i81s,t1_c6mru8m,t1_c6mrsxc,null,1435678036,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,bfg_foo,lfc99,,"I haven't bought Liverpool tickets before, but here is some general advice about getting tickets/hotel rooms/etc online when there is a limited supply and large demand.

* Type out all your credit card information (number, expiration date, CVC, billing address) beforehand and have it in a document/sticky on your desktop so that you can copy-and-paste it rather than having to type it all out
* Have two different browsers open to the website so that if one crashes/hangs, you can try the other one (this could result in a double order, so be sure you have enough money for this if you pursue this strategy - you can always unload the ticket later via stubhub or similar)
* start clicking reload 2-3 minutes early - their server might be on a different time
* if you can afford it, go for ""best seat at any price"" but have 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choices in mind if not
* it's easier to find 1 or 2 tickets than 5 or 6 all together - if you are booking for a group and you don't mind splitting up, have multiple members of your group try for pairs of tickets (again, usually easy to resell any extras)
* if it is saying ""sold out"" at 8:16, give it 5 minutes and try again - sometimes they will release the tickets in blocks and/or other people will back out of their purchases, releasing those tickets back to the block (note: I have no idea whether this is true for Anfield, but it is very often true for hotel room blocks)

That would make the side a lot harder to beat as our midfield can all protect the defenders if needed and it would be harder to cut us through the middle. 

I'm aware that Real's goals were from the wings but that was due to a lack of players tracking back and leaving just Maicon/Zaba and Kompany to defend. I'm sure if we used say Yaya, Garcia and Milner that day, Milner would have tracked back to help the two defenders in those situations, leaving Garcia to cover the middle and Yaya to mark players arriving from deep.

Normally, about 1 year in 3 we get snow on the ground for about 1-2 days. Also about 1 year in 2 we get a cold snap, with temperatures down to zero celsius (daytime) and -10 to -15 at night. Otherwise it's usually damp, with temperatures in the +5/-5 celsius range. The main issue is the dark -- at midwinter we get roughly 6-7 hours of daylight, and 17-18 hours of night.

HOWEVER, in the past 3 years we've had two of the coldest/snowiest winters in the past century. (Think in terms of the equivalent of your hottest summers/droughts and you won't go wrong.) November 2010, IIRC, stayed sub-zero the entire month. And in December, it *snowed*. We were cut off for about 72 hours (no planes, ferries, trains or roads in or out of the capital were open); the airport took 20cm of snow in 48 hours. While North Americans might laugh at this, if your local council has got rid of its snow ploughs because it never needs them, it's a bit problematic. And the snow stayed on the ground for nearly a month.

The chances of a 2010-grade winter repeating while you're here are low, but you should be aware that it has happened in the past couple of years and we've had rather anomalous weather this year (multiple wettest-month-since-records-began records being set).",0,1350319577,null,0,false,0,c6msov4,t3_11ig19,t1_c6msov4,t3_11ig19,null,1430153701,2,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,2

The amount of abuse that Savile appears to have got away with it truly shocking, and I have to admit to some fear we're going to get even more Paedofinder General as a society.

But it is absolutely horrendous that he managed to get away with it for so long and that he managed to abuse and rape so many innocent victims. And I mean ""innocent"" there in all its meanings - these were kids, who society should be protecting.

I like to hope that this wouldn't happen today because the investigators of any subsequent police reports would be aware of the earlier allegations - they would now look them up in the police computer (which was simply not possible back in the 60s or 70s) and would hopefully be able to investigate more fully and tenaciously.

I do think that you can have a reasonable discussion with religious people. I sort of see your point about the imaginary man, but it does seem that we can work out a reasonable compromise with most religious people.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"Unless AHA I AM GIROUD SKIMMED ZE BAR starts banging in goals every week you can bet your ass he still has a big chance of going to Arsenal. I still think people shouldn't count Chelsea out. To be fair Falcao would fit in better for them since he's more of a pure goalscorer who can cash in on the inevitable deluge of chances they create, but Llorente would give them a big focal point and could end up making the whole attack better for any team.  

Things both teams can offer that we cannot:

1) Champions League football
2) Lots of Spanish dudes
3) Lots of money

I would be BEYOND shocked if we signed Llorente. It would be a ridiculous coup, miles bigger than Lloris. 

I still think the only way we're ever going to get a world class striker is if we take a chance on some affordable youngster and watch him develop. Putting bias aside, if you were a player like Llorente would you rather go make silly money playing with your comrades in the CL or come to Spurs and make at the very most ~80k and play in Europa? 

IMO we won't sign a striker of that class until we are raking in more revenue playing in our new stadium. To have some perspective you always hear Arsenal fans bemoaning the fact that they can't compete with the likes of City or Chelsea or United in terms of wages. They are of course correct, but they STILL dwarf us. 

I think we'll have to sign someone in January. To persist with only Defoe would be kind of suicidal. It's not our toughest span of the season but it's also hardly simple. I just wouldn't expect some high-profile striker. I bet it'll be someone a bit under the radar that we haven't been talking about a lot.

&gt;I sort of see your point about the imaginary man, but it does seem that we can work out a reasonable compromise with most religious people.

I don't believe we can with these guys, they value their beliefs about their lives, and many of their comrades are clearly willing to dispose of their own lives and others' in the name of those beliefs. Radical Islam doesn't really allow for debate.

&gt;This is the real problem. A large number of these protestors are outraged largely because everyone else is outraged. Mass psychology is bizarre like that.

It's not about the video, its about their insecurity. For the most part in the west we don't really respect Islam (or most/all religions) much, we don't take it seriously, and we don't look upon it fondly. To these guys its their entire lives and it makes them really fuckin' insecure that so many people can write it off so easily. So they protest to make us take it seriously - they want *us* to be offended, or at the very least to appreciate their offence, becaue then that makes them feel like we're taking these beliefs which are really important to them seriously.

But we're not going to, because their beliefs are pretty backward and Europe is headed for post-religion in a very rapid way, and to most atheists who've spent their life that way religion looks just plain ridiculous.

&gt;The main problem is, finding a compromise would be impossible.

As noted by the good Admiral, I have been traveling for the past few days. While that by itself isn't a big deal, a combination of delayed flights, long drives and a couple days of partying in London before I left mean I haven't had time to smell the roses

An interesting quandary with Ashley Cole. While Bertrand is the future and has been playing well (though in a completely different position for the most part) he isn't close to Ashley Cole level yet. On one hand you have the prospect of losing a top-form player before it's necessary, and I say top-draw in the proper sense. He has been the only England player for some time who would make the World XI, maybe Joe Hart someday will be another in that category. On the other hand, he has drawn a lot of unnecessary attention to the team this season, Bertrand may be deemed capable at less than half of Cole's salary and/or the club may decide that he will decline around the end of next season so a 1 year deal is the only option

With regards to the rumours, I think it's just more destabilising shit-stirring like we've seen from most journos for the past few weeks, anything with an anti-Chelsea slant on it will prove popular. I don't know anything about the background to all this, but I think a compromise deal will be reached. On the face of it, Cole signs a 1 year deal and maintains the club line that over-30s only get 1 year. In the contract is an option to auto-renew for a further year, left to Cole to exercise

With this compromise, Cole has the security of a 2 year deal, the ability to negotiate next season and leave with the club's blessing if/when he gets a deal that suits him, the club maintains it's public stance on 1 year deals. I think this would work best as if Chelsea are winning trophies this season, Cole can either leave on a high note or stick around for one last season by renewing. I think the clubs looking to sign him will still be interested in a year older Cole so it's not crucial he leaves straight away. Another factor to consider is what Lampard intends to do, as the club won't want to lose two legends at the same time",0,1350325512,null,0,false,0,c6mucz5,t3_11ieid,t1_c6mucz5,t3_11ieid,null,1430154495,48,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,48

I'm not really sure that's true, but even accepting it, I would argue that ""telling jokes about everyone, including those society considers underprivileged"" is one interpretation of equality. Not making jokes about ""vulnerable minorities"" could be seen as special treatment.

I have to say, I really disagree with this and you're very close to ""no true Scotsman"" territory if not there already.

I would say the rule of law is the most integral aspect when it comes to equality, but that provides protection against you being locked up arbitrarily because a judge doesn't like black people, it doesn't protect against you being the target of tasteless jokes. Furthermore, I think you're importing an almost socialist element into liberalism, and while modern parties like the Liberal Democrats certainly have leftist components, you've also got the Orange Book wing who are all about free markets and non-interventionist solutions to social problems.

Finally, you can't simply assume a factual statement like

&gt; Making jokes at the expense of vulnerable members of society has a negative impact on equality.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"Because this is the quid pro quo which already exists. A person working in a car plant is probably ten times more productive now than they were thirty years ago, which makes them far more valuable as a worker, and brings export money into the domestic economy; and their wages have gone up significantly over that time in real terms. Public sector workers cannot become massively more productive in this way (and this is incidentally the reason why widespread public sector privatization is not sensible), but they provide important services to the rest of the public, educating children, providing medical care, organizing the maintenance of infrastructure and so on. The implicit agreement is that public sector wages go up as private sector wages go up, to provide these services well, but the flip-side is that they must go down as private sector wages go down. You can't expect public sector wages to go up while the country is getting richer, and then carry on going up while the country gets poorer. 

You can talk about counter-cyclical spending, but there would be an inevitable lag of a year or two in the indexing system, and you could always extend this natural lag for a year or two further. Or, really, countercyclical spending would be far better for being spent on productive investments into the economy, for instance into new transport or communications infrastructure, housing, or research, rather than just increasing the wages of a section of society. Money should go towards common investment, not solely consumption.

Despite the obvious nature of this agreement between private and public sectors, we still spend a huge amount of political effort battling in a completely futile way, one against the other. Better to just index one to the other, and then pull together as a society. It would make common wealth in the common interest.

true,MyNameisDon_,null,null,"&gt;Racism is DISCRIMINATION based on race. Describing someone as black isn't racist. Judging them for it is. Making a joke about the Mandarin language isn't racist. Assuming they are stupid for speaking it is.

Language is part of racial identity, accent is inherent to language.  You can't mock someone's accent without looking down on their culture and seeing it as ""trivial"" and worthy of mockery.  You don't mock things you respect, you mock things you think are funny, silly, stupid or whathaveyou.  So, by mocking someone's language, accent, you are basically saying ""your voice, culture and language are worthy of ridicule"". **That IS discrimination as you are treating someone differently because of some aspect of their culture/race** i.e. mocking the fact they sound different to you, also as Frankie Boyle is a popular entertainer, it helps normalise that behaviour in others, his influence possibly leading others to think that is acceptable.

http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/discrimination?s=t

&gt;treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction in favor of or against, a person or thing based on the group, class, or category to which that person or thing belongs rather than on individual merit: racial and religious intolerance and discrimination. 

In this instance, Frankie Boyle is distinguishing and mocking the difference in language (an aspect of racial culture) of the Chinese.

&gt;White knighting is looking for credit from others for poor arguments, for no reason. It can be against 'sexism, 'racism', whatever. The point is you start throwing those terms around without knowing what you're talking about, in the hope that community will acknowledge you.

What has that got to do with anything?  Conservative bullshit.

If we signed Jordy Clasie for 5m, I think I would have to restrain myself from being a dick to Liverpool fans. I mean, they signed Joe Allen for thrice as much. Clasie is basically a raw and more gifted version of Allen who can actually pass the ball forward. 

Kid would be an absolute steal at 5m and well worth the risk his smaller physique carries. To me his skill set would be perfect for the PL and indeed for what we need in our midfield. He's mobile but he has great vision and isn't afraid to be direct with his passing now and then. 

I guess if I had to compare him to someone more familiar it would be Jack Wilshere. Tenacious, hard-working but also creative. His size doesn't really concern me but I've noticed maybe he doesn't have the best stamina. Still, for 5m it's a no-brainer.

I don't know why, but I thought about trying the password without the symbols. It worked.

My conclusion is that since the new online banking system doesn't allow symbols in passwords (and that's a whole other discussion), it's possible they had updated my password to remove them from mine.

Oh, but it is.  Certainly the more censorious and ""traditional"" right wingers are very much against the idea of female sexuality.  Sex is something men want that women have, and we need to protect the delicate flowers from being exposed to our uncontrollable lust.  The idea that normal healthy women might like, and actively pursue, sex is an anathema.

true,thenextdoctor,null,null,"I feel your pain. The thing about the British Army is that uniform regulations for the No. 1 and No. 2 dress vary from regiment to regiment and time period to time period. Generally a few things stay the same; Brown service tunic is pretty much standard, as it the khaki shirt worn underneath. The woven wool dark brown tie is also pretty much standard for all ranks after WWII (silk ties were popular for officers during the war years). Russet Brown oxfords are pretty much the standard for footwear in No. 2s, but again some units have unique uniform items for their type of troops (rifle regiments, paras, aviation, cavalry, light infantry, armor, etc...). My best advice would be to Google a unit you feel some kind of connection to (I have Welsh and Irish heritage, so I was on the lookout for insignia from the Royal Welsh Fusiliers or the Royal Ulster Rifles) and find images of their uniforms for a start. Generally you'll have to do some visual detective work with images of the uniforms to get a grasp on how items are placed (again it varies from unit to unit, not to mention time period to time period). FYI; units in the UK are distinguished by their collar and cap badges, headgear, buttons, and additional uniform items (hackels, kilts, sashes, etc). Again, ebay.co.uk will be invaluable for you. I found a complete set of buttons, collar badges, and rank for an officer of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers from WWII for my Glider Pilot uniform there (Pilots generally wore the uniform of their former regiment plus the wings and maroon beret of the WWII air corps, not a bad basis for a UNIT uniform..). 

So, to make a long story short, there is no overarching regulation for No. 1 and No. 2 dress. It's all up to the unit you select for your basis. Osprey publishing books are also helpful, they've got a wealth of photos and illustrations. Try Amazon or Osprey's website for those. Just so you know, UK No. 2 Sam Browne belts are almost uniformly brown. Some regiments wear black with the No. 1s but that's not universal. 

Again, good luck. Feel free to run any more questions you'd like past me. I am a historical uniform collector, and work part time as a production assistant for a small film company that has done many military films (often coordinating the costumes for the soldiers). As well as an Army National Guard NCO, so I've got a wealth of knowledge to draw upon.

A comedian is sectarian if he makes fun solely out of Catholics *or* solely out of Protestants. If he goes after both it's kind of hard to level that accusation at him surely ? 

Self deprecation isn't really a bad trait either IMHO - the comedy tradition is that you really should be able to laugh at yourself too.

The ""humanist"" thing was meant to bea play on words ...( a variation on the old gag 'if a vegetarian is someone who eats vegetables then what is a humanitarian ?)  Sorry, thought it was obvious, my bad.

Currently our pay is being cut, pension contributions going up for less pension at the end of it, retirement age being increased, and various other things which mean the job is very unpredictable.

Coupled with massive budget cuts you have officers being forcefully retired and very little new recruitment meaning existing staff are over worked.

Don't get me wrong, I love my job, however I would wait a few years until things settle to decide if the way it ends up is still a good job to join.

In the mean time I strongly suggest applying to be a Special, it is likely to be the main way in other than a graduate scheme in the future and will give you an idea of whether you want to dedicate your life (which is what you end up doing) to the job or not.

If you still like the idea many police forces are looking for qualifications such as the [Police, Law &amp; Community](http://www.esa.uk.net/PoliceLawandCommunity/WhatisPLC/tabid/417/Default.aspx).

Unemployment peaked at 3 million - 20% worse per capita than the recent peak. Manufacturing capacity fell by 20%. Average wage was the equivalent of £19000 today but income tax was higher with the basic rate at 30% and the tax free allowance would be equivalent to £3000 so double the income tax you'd pay now in real terms. Petrol was the equivalent of 90p per litre but cars struggled to do 30MPG. Bread was the equivalent of £1.10 (I can buy a loaf of Kingsmill for £1 at my local Costcutter) and a pint of milk was the equivalent of 54p - twice as much as now. The cheapest pair of jeans you could find on the markets was the equivalent of £30 - you can buy them for a fiver in Asda, and a school uniform was the equivalent of £60 - you can buy one for a tenner from Asda now. 

Also another thing constantly said at people my age by people your age which is totally wrong is how much cheaper housing was back then. Sure the houses were so you could qualify to get a mortgage on a house with an average salary but you couldn't afford to pay it because mortgage interest rates were around 12% - 15%. which had the effect of more than doubling the repayments of a mortgage comparing it to mortgage rates of today. The average house price in 1985 was the equivalent of £89,000 today but mortgage interest rates were so high the repayments would be the equivalent of a £185,000 mortgage at todays rates. And you had to try and afford that with the equivalent of a £19,000 wage, £16k of which was taxed at 30%. How many people do you know on £19k could afford repayments on a £185k mortgage? And how many of them could afford it with £16k of that £19k being taxed at 30%?

So as you can see, wages were lower, we paid more tax and things were a lot more expensive in real terms yet I doubt you'd say many people in their mid 40's have a hard time yet for us it was worse than it is now by a long shot as I hope I've illustrated. I didn't do this as an our generation vs your generation thing but rather I hope this makes you realise things aren't as bleak as you think they are now and that it will come good in the end.

Because we have worked shit hard too in our time so why should you get any special treatment because you're doing exactly the same as every previous generation has done? In my 20s and 30s I was doing 60+hr weeks. Hell when I was still at school aged 13-16 I did 50+hr weeks during summer working in a seaside cafe washing dishes in the holidays as did a lot of kids in my town and other seaside resorts in the 80's. In fact the earliest age I worked was age 10. I'd turn up at 7am on a Saturday and Sunday morning at the coach park along with a couple of dozen other kids with hand made carts to meet the coaches with the holiday makers on. We'd then carry their luggage in the carts to their hotel/B&amp;B for 20p-50p a go. In the afternoon, we'd go to hotels and carry luggage back to the coach park for those going home. And we'd do that on a Saturday and Sunday from 7am to around 4pm every single weekend from just before Easter to around the middle of September. Its just what kids did in our town because people living in the town didn't have a lot of money. You couldn't find a set of pram wheels for love nor money in March. Eventually the taxis got pissed off and it was banned by the council but Bridlington Barrow Boys as we were known were a tradition for decades.

That is why you don't get any support from older generations. We didn't get it from our parents - it was expected that is what you did to prove your worth to have a job.

&gt;Edelman v Harcott

&gt;E, the owner of a black cab driven by his agent, R, brought an action in negligence against H, another black cab driver, claiming the costs of repair 
to his vehicle arising from damage caused when a passenger of H opened a rear door of the cab into R's path. H counterclaimed, alleging that R should 
have avoided the collision. The collision occurred in the ""drop off"" area outside busy train station where in order to drop passengers, a cab needed 
to pull up to the kerb on its offside. A rear passenger opened her nearside door into R's path but left the scene without leaving any details. Evidence 
was given that the area outside the station was badly designed for dropping passengers off, and that a driver of a black cab had some degree of control 
over unlocking the rear doors.

&gt;Held, giving judgment for the claimant, that the passenger was clearly negligent in opening the rear door when it was unsafe to do so. However, 
there were circumstances when a cab driver was responsible for the actions of his passengers but such liability only arose if there was negligence on 
the part of the driver. As H had acknowledged that the area was unsafe, he should have taken steps to prevent the passenger opening the door into a 
line of traffic by either keeping the doors locked or by telling the passenger not to get out on the nearside of the cab; accordingly H was negligent.

true,Jamaicaman90,cnty-wales,Swansea,"&gt;I'm not really sure that's true, but even accepting it, I would argue that ""telling jokes about everyone, including those society considers underprivileged"" is one interpretation of equality. Not making jokes about ""vulnerable minorities"" could be seen as special treatment.

I think this is a point too often forgotten. There are certainly lines for each group of people that shouldn't be crossed, but outright refusing to talk about certain groups because they can't take the joke should probably be more of an insult than having a silly remark thrown at you.

On a smaller scale, if I'm with a group of friends who bond with constant ribbing and jokes at the expense of each other, if everybody but me gets the odd joke thrown out against them I'm going to assume that either they think I'm too pathetic to joke about, I'm not worth spending the time on or I'm too delicate to take a joke. Not one of those is something I'd want to be!

To take it further still (and into controversial territory, so please be civil!), I'd suggest that perhaps a group that refuses to have any jokes made about them is likely to be more xenophobic than the group making them. Again, in most cases this will be a small subset of that community, or even people who aren't a part of it, but determined to be offended on their behalf.

This continues on from what you're saying - someone of a (non-political) liberal mindset is more capable of both giving out and taking jokes than a (non-political) heavily conservative, isolationist mindset.

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"&gt; You probably right, but I don't think an extra 4-5 million would hurt, especially if it helps us to avoid another Dempsey type situation.

From what I understand, the ""Dempsey situation"" wasn't because we didn't have enough money to pay for Dempsey, but rather that FSG were unwilling to exceed their valuation of him. FSG said to Rodgers ""they want 6m for Dempsey, we think that's too much, but if you want Daniel Sturridge we're willing to pay up to 15m for him"". Rodgers didn't want Sturridge because of attitude problems (as an aside, I'm quite happy about that). So something like an added naming rights deal wouldn't have gotten us Dempsey either way.

The Dempsey situation is more a failing of scouting than anything, really - if FSG were adamant they were never going to pay 6m or so for Dempsey, there needed to be a plan B signing who would be value for money. (And that plan B sure as hell wasn't Sturridge, because the manager vetoed him.) The fact that there wasn't one is the big issue - if Liverpool had decided not to get Dempsey, but had brought someone else in, it would be fine.

As for a short-term naming rights deal, that never happens - sponsors who get naming rights are given a very large amount of exposure, so they tend to be long-term deals. It also tends to be part of a larger ""main sponsor"" deal, e.g. Arsenal and the Emirates, or City and Etihad, where they are the sponsors on their shirts as well.

IIRC, the Standard Chartered deal ends at the end of this season, so there's a possibility that the new main/shirt sponsor could have naming rights included in their package, but it would be a long-term partnership, more than the 4 years Standard Chartered got, and given that the club will hope to be back in the top 4 within those 4 years, thereby increasing our sponsorship value, it doesn't make sense to commit to a long-term partnership right now.",0,1350346802,null,0,false,0,c6n0fj7,t3_11i6ig,t1_c6n0fj7,t1_c6n020h,null,1430157416,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Actually, disagree with you here mate. Around when Cisse came in, Pardew shifted to a 4-3-3; it got more out of Papiss and Hatem Ben Arfa, but it shunted Demba Ba to the left, hence the lack of goals. This season, Pardew keeps moving between the 4-4-2 and 4-3-3, but basically the pattern is the same - when Ba plays centrally, he scores; when played on the left, he mostly doesn't.

&gt; why would he come here for less?

He's almost Guaranteed first team football here (lets be real having a natural right winger would make life easier for us so theres an incentive), we'd have a (tbd) reliable right winger who fits the speed and pace of the BR system and fill the hole left by Kuyt. Were not exactly a step down, sure Arsenal have CL at the moment but there not winning anything and all their best players in recent years have been jumping ship to find trophies, we know, most intelligent fans and players know its only a matter of time before were back in the top 4/5 and then challenging again.

Your also forgetting one VITAL point, he's unhappy/frustrated with the lack of...praise? support? hes been getting at Arsenal.

he's had a relatively bad run at Arsenal last 2 seasons and most of the fans have grown impatient with him, in the last 2 transfer windows Wenger has openly tried to buy players in Theo's position (I here this January there going to try and get rid of him once and for all and bring in Adrian Lopez in (last I heard))

I ALSO have heard and its been reported many times that there is a growing frustration/problem between Wenger and Theo on a number of issues.

So why would he leave them to come to us for less? Because except for wages and a (temporarily) higher league position were the only other big team in England that could use him, it also helps that he's a life long LFC fan...

""Allons-Y!  ~also the doctor""

It's reasonably foreseeable (objectively speaking) that opening the door into a road without looking could lead to another car being hit. Causation is straightforward here - but for your opening of the door, the incident wouldn't have occurred. Strictly speaking, yes, you could get sued - but the BMW has a duty to mitigate and shouldn't be benefitting from the incident in any way. I'd be surprised if £1500 is a reasonable amount; ask to see the quotations and verify them yourself. Also ask for photographs of the damage.

Given the sums involved, chatting with the CAB is a great first step. Might even be worth paying a solicitor to send the BMW driver a letter asking him to justify the sum.

HOWEVER, this is exactly the sort of thing that the cabbie's insurance policy is for (they then might seek a contribution from you). If you don't have the taxi's details, going to the police is a good shout. The cabbie shouldn't have driven off without exchanging details, so he's likely in a world of shit if he gets caught.

Just because i don't think all property is theft like you do, doesn't mean that i don't understand the distinction between morality and legality. Thank you for trying to tell me my opinion though.

So far all you've argued is that my pragmatic and practical understanding of property and law is flawed, without justified reason. You have missused the word monopoly a number of times but not given any other reasons. I just want to make this clear, a monopoly is not over any single item/idea, it is over a commodity or industry. If i paint the mona lisa i have the rights to that work, and the right to stop other people copying it (through the legal system), a monopoly would be over all paintings which IP does not constitute.

I don't think your familiar with the law at all. In fact i think you probably miss read a textbook and see yourself as an armchair lawyer. This is more than me and even I can see the flaw in your logic. 

&gt;Everyone has the rights to their own labour.

A right is enforceable by law. The government is an agent of law. That is why the government will enforce property rights. These two concepts are interlinked, you cannot support a right without enforceability.
 
&gt;on what basis can I expect the government to enforce my keeping it and yet selling it ad nauseum?

The government is not an agent of reproduction of IP. This doesn't even make sense. They have absolutely no role in it. All you can expect is for them to stop people impinging on your rights. See previous argument.
Also ad nauseum here is meaningless, nausea is not grounds for anything.

You have made no effort to justify your extreme conjecture about the true nature of property and intellectual property despite it being totally unrecognizable as a legitimate doctrine and have confused most concepts about law and society.

true,geekchic,null,null,"&gt; If you sell in the UK, you should get taxed here, and not be able to claim that you are actually running your business from a small cupboard in Switzerland.

Too simple.

A company is perfectly free to have a subsidiary in one country, and manage some of the company in another country - such as for example, Dyson being based in the UK and managing the affairs of overseas subsidiaries from the UK.

Likewise, Starbucks (etc) having a UK company and managing some of it from the USA (royalties) or Ireland (corporation tax).

The news article overlooks that most of the legislation that permits them to do this is based on EU rules about cross-border operations - so changing the rules wasn't something that the previous Labour government could do, nor the current coalition can do either. Unless we withdraw from the EU?

Of course, there is a fairly simple solution to the problem, but it is one that will be roundly objected to by everyone.... expand VAT and reduce corporation and income taxes so that people are not any worse off in net terms.

If you tax at the point of consumption it is almost impossible to shunt net profits into offshore accounts. To counter that, you then need to lower corporation tax and income tax so that the overall tax rate is unchanged - but it would bring in higher cash revenues.

true,ZombieWomble,null,null,"&gt; Of course, there is a fairly simple solution to the problem, but it is one that will be roundly objected to by everyone.... expand VAT and reduce corporation and income taxes so that people are not any worse off in net terms. If you tax at the point of consumption it is almost impossible to shunt net profits into offshore accounts. To counter that, you then need to lower corporation tax and income tax so that the overall tax rate is unchanged - but it would bring in higher cash revenues.

I can see this argument working from the point of view of an individual - but how does it work for corporations? UK businesses can claim back VAT on the majority of business-related purchases, so they don't have any meaningful ""consumption"" to tax. This would mean that changes in the VAT rate won't have any direct effect on the tax level they pay on their net profits, which would then be trivial to shunt overseas where the consumption taxes don't apply. There may be some indirect effects on their ability to sustain their current profit margins in the face of higher VAT rates, but I'd bet Starbucks' annual sales that the majority of any such tax burden would be passed onto consumers, rather than paid by Starbucks themselves.

This approach seems like it would further exacerbate the problem of shunting tax burdens away from corporate revenue and onto individual revenue.

true,thedingoismybaby,cnty-uk,™,"What would you like to know?

The job is very demanding personally and professionally.

One major thing to know is you can not strike, it is illegal to even discuss a strike as a police officer.

The job asks a lot, in theory you work a 40 hour equivalent week however this could be (and is in places) 7 days of 10 hour night shifts in a row and then a few days off. There are variable shift patterns, which can be changed with little notice, and this can make it hard to balance your private life.

You can be called in to duty and ordered to do overtime, including at very short notice, and this has included officers having holidays cut short to return to work. If you have a court case which needs you to cancel your holiday you could be arrested if you don't attend when required. Because of the type of work you do you are often dealing with court cases and this is always a possibility.

Due to the nature of the job you can never guarantee finishing on time, and the first 30 minutes of overtime are unpaid. You could end up arresting someone half an hour before you finish your shift because there is no one else around to do so and as a result you could be several hours late finishing. 

On top of this there are the things I mentioned before which I can expand on if you'd like.

Another major thing is the type of incidents you go to, you have to go from talking to a kid at school about staying away from drugs to talking down a suicidal person on a bridge to fighting with drunken idiots outside the local pub, and you could do all of this in one day!

This is not a job you can do for the money, you have to enjoy the job itself or you wouldn't put up with everything else that comes along with it.

You can do a neighbourhood role in a rural area dealing with basic crimes and old ladies giving you tea, in fact many officers do this everyday and enjoy doing so, but be aware you could be moved into any department or role and could be called upon to provide support anywhere. And you never know what you'll come across in your rural area. There may not be much ""serious"" crime but you could be the first to arrive at a fatal road traffic collission and you need to deal with it, or come across a child who's being beaten by his parents, could you deal with that?

A middle age British lady I know via forums had a sig pic of Ten coming out of the TARDIS. At the time, I had no idea what it was at all. I did not recognize the TARDIS or David Tennant. It was just a picture. Oh, and she had a huge crush on him. This didn't make me want to find out what it was and go watch it. I actually don't remember what possessed me to start, but I asked her where to start. With the 2005 revival or 1963. She said ""Just start with 'Rose'.""

I thought okay, easy to find on the torrent, I'll just get this one episode and see what it's about, and if I like it, I'll pick up the season on DVD. I watched the first five minutes or so, and just fell in love with everything about it. How it was shot, the camera angles, the music and whatnot, it was just nice. Nine always was a weird Doctor. But I like Rose, always did. (I'm not a big fan but I did miss him for a couple episodes after Ten took over.) Naturally, I got the DVDs. The only episodes I really haven't liked were actually in that season (series). ""World War Three"" and the other one. That two-parter. The opening was good, but the whole thing was just ""meh"". Any of the other episodes would have been better as the two-parter. And of course ""Dalek"" was my first ever time seeing the Daleks.

It's just a silly show. It doesn't take itself seriously, or strive to be great. It aims for the middle of the road, but somehow always ends up better than it seems to intend. I'm really glad I started giving sci-fi shows like this a chance (also Firefly, Stargate SG-1/Atlantis, Eureka, couple others). I remember thinking Star Trek was the best of science fiction, and it's just the tip of the iceberg (or it once was, I don't know what the gateway sci-fi show is today -- it might even be Doctor Who).",0,1350378275,null,0,false,0,c6n6znu,t3_11jt8t,t1_c6n6znu,t3_11jt8t,null,1430160584,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

The real problem here is that corporations now have more mobility than governments. If a corporation doesn't like your tax regime and it's headquartered or locally based in your country, it will just up sticks and move to a more favourable location. Despite the tax dodging, this is still a loss for the employee (loses job), the job seeker (more competition from experienced people recently made redundant), the local economy (fewer jobs required to support these MNCs in sectors like food, where it's hard to avoid taxes) and the national economy (reduced tax revenues from support jobs thanks to slower business, employees out of a job need help from the state).

But what I find really perplexing is the right-wing solution to this which is ""cut taxes, encourage more corporations"". Really? That's a temporary fix to a problem which won't go away - namely that governments are being eclipsed in influence by corporations, and as citizens of a democratic nation with a high standard of living and high taxes that is not appealing to global corporations for financial reasons despite out other strengths, we should be concerned with a way to stop this. The solution isn't to encourage corporations to come here with a rock bottom tax rate so that they can fuck everyone over in *other* nations whilst they pay the bare minimum, nothing or even get money back here in the UK, it's to look at supranational organisations like the EU and help them establish tax regimes capable of transcending boundaries for corporation and capital gains tax, so that there is little or no incentive for corporations to jump around the place for their own gain at society's expense.",0,1350378325,null,0,false,0,c6n6zuh,t3_11k3mh,t1_c6n6zuh,t3_11k3mh,null,1430160587,45,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,45

Unless we withdraw from the EU?

Citation needed - I think you may be overstating the amount of power the EU has over UK tax rates. Also the UK is a member of the EU - we would not need to leave the EU to make changes. There has already been talk within the EU of a minimum corporation tax level and transparent country by country reporting within the EU. The fact is that the UK, and this government in particular, is not particularly found of these measures as the UK is already pretty close to a tax haven. We have non-doms, who are able to live in the UK and not pay tax on their earnings from outside the UK, and a falling level of corporation tax at a time when over taxes are rising and spending is being cut.

&gt;Of course, there is a fairly simple solution to the problem, but it is one that will be roundly objected to by everyone.... expand VAT and reduce corporation and income taxes so that people are not any worse off in net terms.

&gt;If you tax at the point of consumption it is almost impossible to shunt net profits into offshore accounts. To counter that, you then need to lower corporation tax and income tax so that the overall tax rate is unchanged - but it would bring in higher cash revenues.
Anyone fancy a 25% VAT rate?

There some problems with this suggestion. The first is that it wouldn't be 100% effective - on-line retailers like Amazon already avoid VAT by being based in Luxenbourg and claiming sales are made from there. People could also just go abroad to physically buy things from there, if the tax on UK sales was high enough to make it worthwhile. Secondly it would benefit companies that don't make their profits from selling VATable items. The banks for example would gain massively from getting rid of corporation tax, since they don't make their money from selling anything that VAT is charged on. This would shift the UK economy even more towards the unproductive financial sector while hurting businesses that actually make and sell things. Thirdly, VAT would have to rise much higher than an extra 5% to make up for the lost revenue by cutting corporation tax from 24% to 0%, especially taking into consideration some companies already make profits without paying VAT so would now be tax free. A large rise in VAT would cause further inflation and people would find themselves unable to afford things other than the basic necessities (unless you made those VATable to).

Now this is a misleading statement; VAT is value added to the product at the point of sale - its even called ""Value Added Tax"" it is a tax that is entirely paid for by the customer. You could argue it costs you in administration costs; but you don't pay the VAT, you add 20% to the value of the products or services that you sell. 

To argue a business, and not its customers, pays VAT is far more misleading than a headline that grabs peoples attention succinctly in 10 words and the clarifies the details in the article; this is a good headline from the point of view of anyone's standards.

For example I could give you the title of a scientific paper and any half decent scientist would argue that its almost always sensationalist; but that's fine, as long as the details are clarified in the article - it got you to read it more, therefore it serves its purpose.

Then as laws got updated, this provision was copy/pasted into the new laws, without any real thought as to what it said. Now it is a [fairly generic law](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/section/127), covering anything sent over a ""public electronic communications network"" that is ""grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character."" There is also a second related to ""causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety"" by sending a message that is false, or by repeated use of a network.

The people who get to decide what is offensive etc. are the police, the CPS, and the lay magistrates. This law never goes to a jury.

So, why is it on the statute books? Because no one cares. At a time when there is a huge economic crises, and many people are having to vote based on which Party is likely to let them put food on the table, or keep their job, an obscure law on the Internet isn't a big issue.

Among many politicians (who sometimes end up on the receiving end of these sorts of messages) the law is broadly supported. If you're interested, there was a debate on ""Internet Trolling"" in the House of Commons last month, and a transcript is available [here](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2012-09-17a.754.0).

There are major problems with this law and its application, and many lawyers (including those involved in these sorts of cases) are pretty critical of it...  but there's no political will in, nor sufficient votes to be won by, changing it.

UK unis generally have offers of something like ABB meaning 3 A-levels with minimum grades of ABB (this was my offer). Obviously there is a range of offers, from AAA* to DDD. This will mean (unless you have aced every exam ever) that you will be eligible for some unis but not others. This will depend significantly on the course: law, medicine and economics are competitive. I needed ABB for management at my uni, but a friend in the same uni needed AAA* for the law degree. So be aware of this.

For example, at the university of east anglia, this is the BSc psychology. You need AAB and BBBBB at GCSE.

Learn what branding means. They already sell overpriced sugary crap, and the people lap it up. You think that them adding 5% onto the price will make ANY difference to their customer base ? None whatsoever.

Corporations have a duty to their shareholders first, and the public second. ANY cost that can be passed on to the consumer will be passed on to the consumer.

I'm not saying it's right, I'm just saying that's how it is. And you are delusional to think otherwise.

I really don't give a fuck how much profit they are making, and how much tax they are paying on it to be quite honest. Provided they are giving much needed employment, paying the payroll taxes, health insurance and other benefits to their employees, it's N less people on the dole that I'll have to subsidize via my taxes.

In an ideal world, we'd have reciprocal taxes with every single country, and a worldwide policy of balanced taxes meaning there are no more havens or loopholes. However, we don't live in the ideal world, we live in the real world.

The first is its origin - the vast majority of private property can be traced back to robbery and plunder; so-called [primitive accumulation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjBVr5Myh6M).  

Secondly, [""(a) third party (the State) which has a monopoly, enforced at gunpoint, on the power to determine ownership, will use force to ensure that the concept of ownership which it believes to be correct, just, and valid, will be respected by the masses.""](http://www.gonzotimes.com/2011/08/anarchist-views-on-property-as-theft-and-freedom/)

Finally, private property ensures each person is born into trespass and hierarchy - subject to pay rent to the landlord, fealty to the lord, obedience to the master and to be exploited by the capitalist.  Private property is the theft of our birthright, which is freedom.

&gt;You have missused the word monopoly a number of times

I was fairly explicit about the sense in which I was using the word.  See meanings 2 and 3 [here](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/monopoly).

On IP rights.  You need to consider how your belief in ""real"" property rights and your belief in ""intellectual"" property rights stand in direct contradiction. If you protect and enforce intellectual property ""rights"", allowing people to create artificial scarcities via government mandate, you necessarily undermine actual property rights arising from genuine scarcity.   Stephan Kinsella puts it this way, [""had a particularly gifted Cro-Magnon man been able to patent the building of log cabins, his heirs today would be entitled to prevent us from building cabins on our own land, with our own logs, until we paid whatever tribute they demanded.""](http://mises.org/media/categories/226/Against-Intellectual-Property)  I'm ever more restricted in how I may use my own bought and paid for hardware and software, restricted to the point where it sometimes becomes completely unusable.  It all leads to [a dystopian future](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html).  [Carson provides a more thorough treatment.](http://www.c4ss.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/intellectual-property-a-libertarian-critique.pdf)

&gt;The government is not an agent of reproduction of IP. This doesn't even make sense. They have absolutely no role in it.

Let me help you by giving you a link from HMRC (they should know right?): http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/incometax/ways-to-pay.htm

&gt;If you're an employee your employer will deduct Income Tax from your wages throughout the year - using the tax code HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) provides to them - and send the deductions back to HMRC. If you get a pension, your pension provider will deduct tax in the same way. This system of collecting Income Tax is known as Pay As You Earn - usually shortened to PAYE.

It's to take away the burden of having to fill in self-assessments, save up money and pay over to HMRC yourself that your employer does it for you.  It is not a tax on the business.  As I said above, you could argue that Starbucks providing employment increases total income tax paid by UK citizens, but what's to say that Costa, Cafe Nero, or even small coffee shops wouldn't fill that gap, and pay over more Corporation Tax while they're at it?",0,1350388178,null,0,false,0,c6n7xoz,t3_11k3mh,t1_c6n7xoz,t1_c6n7uga,null,1430161031,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

If VAT were abolished, then every company could lower their prices by 20% without affecting their bottom line.

But their competitors are still working on the same costs, so can afford to reduce their prices back down to 100%, and so force the others out of the marketplace.

Barca are buying Neymar...NEYMAR.

Messi AND Neymar. Neymar upfront 100% of the time Messi as his back up. They have very low injury rates compared to other players (cept neymar who's a girl but no long term injuries) and I dont know if Sanchez and Tello like sitting on the bench but expect them to be camped there, I know Tello for a fact is a fighter and wants first team football, not sure about Sanchez yet but we've been linked to him twice before.

My advice, never rule anybody out when theres some kind of potential connection, not saying it will happen but with a situation like this brewing at Barca expect one if not both of them to leave

It's fair because they don't have to if they don't want to.  I'm not making anyone do anything, all i'm doing is pointing out that, hey maybe making fun of people's language and therefore culture is racist.  

People can be exactly as shitty as they want to be, that's their choice, what I object to is when people try and redefine racism because they like Frankie Boyle.  If someone is okay with not having the same moral standards as me, they should at least have the courage to admit they don't care instead of pretending that certain behavior is okay despite evidence to the contrary.

Basically, the upshot is, if you want to be an asshole (not you specifically, but the general you) be an asshole and accept the criticism that comes with it.  If Frankie doesn't want to be called racist, maybe he shouldn't use racist humour.

&gt;I'll rip the piss out of my mates to their face, I don't care what anyone says in relation to that, that's how we bond. 

Yeah, this is banter.  I'm not going to criticise you for that because that's *your* relationship and I'm assuming everyone is happy with that situation.  I mean, if one of your mates one day sincerely asked you to not to say certain things for personal reasons, would you respect that?  I mean, i'm not sure what kind of stuff you say to each other, but I assuming there's lines you wouldn't cross with your mates right?

&gt; But yeah, if I offended someone and they were upset and it wasn't one of my mates then I think an apology would be due.

That's it really, I feel we live in a shitty enough world as it is, there's no point spreading it around and making it hard for each other.

Medical reasons aside - your motives for going through other peoples things should be irrelevant, you still shouldn't do it.

&gt; Secondly, the door shouldn't have been unlocked for people to walk in unchallenged, and there's good reason to believe that the US military, at least initially, exaggerated the sophistication of McKinnon's hack and the damage done simply to spare their blushes.

True to a point - but as I've said there's a degree of common sense to be exercised here. Are you obliged to walk through every open door? Read every piece of paper lying around on someone elses desk? No, you respect privacy. But again that comes back to the medical aspect.

true,dwair,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"Can I use a slightly different analogy from a police station, one of a building containing money?  I use this analogy when discussing computer security with clients at work.

Scenario 1.  The building is completely anonymous apart from a sign saying building number 3, no one is around, the door is missing and there is a sign above saying “come on in and have a look round” 

Scenario 2.  The building is completely anonymous apart from a sign saying building number 3, no one is around, the door is open and there is no sign above the door” 

Scenario 3.  The building is called “Money Here”, there are some security guards about doing their thing, the door is locked and there is a sign above the door saying “keep out” 

Morally you shouldn't go into the building and help your self to the cash in any of the scenarios but which one would an insurance company pay out on?  In McKinnons case he didn't even take any cash, he just wandered about a bit. 

In my experience most unauthorised access to data comprises of scenarios 1 and 2.  Several holes are left in the infrastructure that just require joining up to make easy access.  I don’t know the ins and outs of the case but I doubt McKinnon spent much time phishing for passwords or crafting key loggers to gain passwords to a secure system, he just found a door and walked right in.  Minor Trespass at most really on McKinnons behalf.  If they (or whoever) can’t be bothered to buy a door and put a lock on it, personally I don’t think they have a right to complain much if someone walks through a hole in the wall occasionally.

I've revised my opinion on Downing now, and I think he's a winger best suited to a counterattacking side - which is why he did so damn well for Martin O'Neill and Houllier at Aston Villa, because they're both predominantly counter-attacking managers. Even when he was in form at Villa, Downing was never reputed for beating his man with trickery or pace - his biggest asset has always been his crossing (one of the best two-footed crossers in the league), and he's got above average defensive skills for a winger as well. 

All of that adds up to a winger who can be useful on the break and attacking space, but not so much when facing packed defensive units where he has to create space. 

Beyond that there's all the issues regarding his mentality and whether he's just too timid to handle being at a big club - I can't remember which game, but one of the games this season Downing only attempted 1 forward pass (may have come on from the bench).

It can be, although the evidence I was talking about [was with regards to similar occurances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ching_chong).  So perhaps we can chalk this one down to ignorance.

&gt;The whole thing's fucking stupid though. If somebody offends someone they are within their rights to be rude, &amp; if someone gets offended by something they're well within their rights to complain about it. I just don't get where this becomes a free speech issue like some people make out. Both parties are exercising their right to free speech*.

I can agree somewhat, it's about taking responsibility for your words.  Like yeah, people have the right to be complete tossers if they want, as long as they don't complain if people call them tossers.  Like, you can be racist if you want, but don't start crying because you face legal or social ramifications.  Freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom from consequences or freedom from criticism.

&gt;This whole argument that people don't have the right to be offended is a bit silly IMO. Of course they do. They just don't have the right to expect there to be legal repercussions.

Right, because people can misuse the notion of being offended.  Being offended doesn't automatically give you a right to legal action, for example many christian groups who target the gay community because their lifestyle offends them.  But likewise I would hope that people who do have legitimate complaints and have been made to feel alienated by racist language see some sort of consequences for the people responsible.

Yes he left us and it hurt us badly but he went for **50 MILLION** (the 6th highest ALL TIME transfer)

Do you have any idea how much talent we could have brought in for 50 million!? Its not his fault we squandered the majority of the money.

Why should we forever hate a player that did SO much for us, left us for a LOT of money and has since contributed next to nothing at Chelsea? Ive only heard him say nice things about us since leaving, the same as Xabi but we dont hear people hating Xabi.

I have ZERO respect for anybody who's only reason for not liking him is because he left us..

I want them to have a voice. That is my only objective. 

Your argument is pretty confused - one minute this poll is pointless, the next I've the power to attempt a manipulation of public opinion. Neither of which are my objectives for the record.

Also, according to your argument the result are invalid in any affect - I'm attempting a preventative measure against misinformation.

Short version is, if you don't wanna do it, don't do it. If you don't see the value of it, downvote it. I don't see the point in debating this because you're obviously not open to my point of view and I'm not going to continually defend mine.

People aren't upset just because he left - sure, that's a part of it, but that's not the crux. Mostly, people are upset because he talked down about Liverpool, left fairly late on but still after we had reinforced with Suarez (though perhaps we already knew about Torres' departure then and Suarez was contingency? I'm not completely familiar with the timeline there), and went to a direct rival. 

Xabi Alonso was essentially told the season before that he was unwanted; we tried to pawn him off to Juventus and replace him with Gareth Barry. He was then sold for a very fair fee to a team in another country while continuously talking about Liverpool as a big club and one he will always love. His situation was about as dissimilar as transfer situations can be other than the large fee received.

Torres left ""to win trophies."" Of course he had a better chance to do that at Chelsea, but that is implicit and does not need to be said. When he talks about that as a step up, well, Liverpool fans don't think there is a step up from Merseyside. He forced his way out - with good reason, mind you - and symbolically turned his back on Liverpool. Of course that hurt fans. Of course they were upset. Of course many still are. 

It's fair play, I say. There's nothing wrong with valuing loyalty, and Torres was not loyal in the end. Did he have his reasons? Absolutely, and he made the right decision for himself. But not for us. 

So yes, we got a lot of money out of it, but we're FANS. We don't care about money. We care about heart and drive and dedication, about men who give it their all just to see us cheer, about guys who, when ownership wants to force them out, get YNWA tattooed across their knuckles. 

For a long time, Torres was a great for us. Still one of my favorite players, and I am happy that we didn't screw him over and keep him against his will.

If I was representing the company I work for at the time I did it, I would fully expect to find myself out of a job pretty sharpish. Remember, someone went to jail simply for swearing at the police only last year.

I think these are much more comparable with the Andrew Mitchell rant than the case of a guy telling dead baby jokes on Twitter.

I can't name any occasion on which I've gone off at someone - it's probably been a while - but I recognise that I'm no saint (not a jab at you).

I can perfectly imagine the feeling of being totally knackered, having done a 10 or 12 hour day at work, maybe being stressed out or pissed off because a project isn't going to plan or some colleague is being difficult. I can perfectly imagine getting on one's bike to cycle home, taking the same route that one has taken every flipping day for weeks or months, and how it would feel to be inconvenienced by some jobsworth, who does so not because it makes sense or is reasonable, but instead just for the sake of being a jobsworth. 

(I'm not saying that there's no sense in refusing to open the Downing Street gates for a cyclist, but if he's been allowed to cycle through them every day of his tenure previously, then he'd probably feel that way at the time). 

Those kids shouldn't have been arrested, never mind imprisoned, for swearing at plod - since they shouldn't, we shouldn't be acting like Mitchell should have been, either. 

Should Mitchell lose his job for it? Maybe, but generally I'd rather we lived in a world in which we could be forgiving to each other, and in which our coppers would say ""calm down, calm down, mate! what's up? had a bad day?"" before reaching for their handcuffs and truncheons.

Building it in Leeds might sound like would boost the northen economy but unless we have damn good transport links it won't be that useful. 

The best thing to do is build a new airport close to London along with some good rail links and a new motorway. I quite like the idea of putting it between the M3 and M4, then providing high speed rail links to the old Eurostar station at Waterloo. That way we'd have 2 existing motorways providing road access, and we'd be able to provide high speed rail links to London along with easy access to Reading (which is a very well connected station). The only bit that needs more work is rail access to the SE which would mean sorting out the Reading/Gatwick line, doing some work at Redhill and making the line run to Ashford.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Those players you mentioned play different position. Though I do love Moutinho (one of my favorite players by far) I think we've reached the point where we may not need him. I really doubt we'll get a starting player as a CM this winter. We have 3 CDM, Dembele, and 2 CAM. We need another player that can create link up play and provide some fantasy from the center, but I don't think we'll be able to get one like Moutinho because it would mean Dembele would spend so much time benched. And Dembele is good, really good. Dembele isn't our weak point. He's, I'd say, 85% of what Modric is, with room to improve. He is much more physical and holds possession just as well, which is his job. We need another young CM that is good at playing the ball out to the wings and holding possession, a player that will be okay with only play 1/3 of matches. Having Moutinho and Dembele and having to decide which of the two to play will be a great problem to have, but I think we're moving a little too fast. It's all about baby steps. 

We need a clinical person up front. Ade is back, so we may see some good stuff out of him, and Defoe has been doing well - but he's not clinical enough. I think we need a clinical striker, backup for the LW, and backup for CM before we get Moutinho (in other words, the backup CM will mean we don't get Moutinho - Dembele won't be happy as a backup, I think). 

I really think the days of us getting Moutinho are gone, and I think we're going to focus on depth and improving our current crop of players now. In January we'll bring players in with that in mind, and work on improving communication and possession. We won't make any big purchases until summer at the earliest, and even then I think we're doing pretty well for ourselves. 

And, keep in mind, Dembele has the stamina of a horse. That guy doesn't stop running. He played just under three full matches back to back over the span of, what, 8 days last week? Our only concern with him should be injury and to cover for that we should keep a young player that doesn't mind sitting on the bench for a good portion of games!

By leaving it so late, he made it so we had virtually no chance to shop him around and were forced to accept Chelsea's bid.

You're looking at everything from a practical perspective. That's fine and, from a practical perspective, **we robbed Chelsea blind.** 50 million for a declining, disgruntled star that we *should* have turned into 2 or 3 world class players (another discussion). 

But many fans are emotional, not practical. Torres left for what he said was a bigger club. Obviously he said it to appease Chelsea fans, but that doesn't mean it's not a slight to Liverpool. I already said he had good reason to leave. I am not mad at him for leaving. But some people are, and they have every right to desire loyalty from their players. Ultimately, Torres **chose** to leave Liverpool for a rival. There were a lot of surrounding circumstances, but he made a choice.

I don't think it was an easy decision for Torres, and I'm surprised that more people didn't want to leave with the toxic environment that LFC was cultivating at the time.

Ultimately, people who are upset with Torres for leaving the way he did are not twats for it; they're just stubborn and emotional. In time, they will forgive him. 

From a personal standpoint, I agree with you - Torres had every right to leave, we benefited from it in the long run, and he is still, as far as I am concerned, a Red. But I think you should be a bit more respectful to fans who don't feel that way.

England assistant Steve Wigley was also involved in a fight near the tunnel.
The 2-0 victory takes England Under-21s through to an unprecedented fourth successive major tournament but the night will be remembered not for the football but for the minutes after the final whistle.
England, who led 1-0 after the home leg, had been on the brink of progressing as the game meandered to a 0-0 draw.
And when Serbia committed goalkeeper Branimir Aleksic up the pitch for a last-ditch free-kick, England broke swiftly to score the goal that wrapped up the tie.
Thomas Ince raced down the right flank and cut the ball back to a rampaging Wickham, who turned the ball into an empty net.

&gt; Then, as the England players celebrated, a series of objects were thrown on the field as the crowd expressed their frustration.
The final whistle was blown almost immediately but Serbia and England players then clashed, before coaches and even officials on both sides became involved.
A series of monkey chants were heard around the stadium as Rose kicked the ball into the crowd and was shown a red card.

He's not spouting negative stuff and then saying YNWA, he's simply giving an example to the Agger transfer saga. He's stating that if Torres really wanted to be here, he would have forced a stay, like Agger.

Also you're missing the crux of his post. The MAIN reason why myself and others are upset about Torres, is because he left for a rival team that we play 2 times a year. That's a hard thing to stomach emotionally, when you've been cheering your favorite/one of your favorite players for 4 years, especially when all of us backed/cheered for him to get back into form for 2+ years. Whether it was or not, it felt like a stab in the back to a lot of fans out there.

&gt;I think you've misunderstood and blown his reference out of proportion, it wasnt an intentional dig at us he was just trying to get into the chelsea fans good books.

He still could have gone about a better way. If he had said something similar to this, while also placating Chelsea, then there wouldn't have been that big of an uproar. I don't remember him saying anything negative about Atletico when he came to us, he said he cherished him time there and was looking forward to helping LFC.

Lets say the hospital costs the NHS £80m to run per year but each year the costs have been rising. They could say to a company 'Look, we'll award you an £80m a year contract to run this hospital for 8 years and here are our terms.' 

Terms could include that all treatments must be offered totally free, same level of service as currently, etc. 

The company will then look around and see where they can make cuts, who they can fire, who they can buy cheaper drugs from, where they can get cheaper syringes, etc and either accept or decline the contract. It doesn't matter if they're making a profit on that £80m a year because it'd still be a saving to the NHS because each year it would have gone up £1m or whatever. 

Total saved over the 8 year contract assuming £1m increases each year under NHS running? £36m.

Tello seems to be out of the picture at Barca, so he may well be happy to move.

Hooper is still relatively young and is a decent player from what I've seen, could be a good back up to Suarez.

Turan &amp; Sanchez, I don't know what their situations are really. I assume Sanchez is fairly regular for Barca &amp; Turan for his club, but they're both good players, so if we could get them, I'd be happy.

Ba is a top player but he's injury prone. If we could get insurance against long-term injuries, or another back-up player (ie; Hooper) he'd be a great buy.

So now you want to create nationalised companies for syringe manufacture, defibrillator manufacture, MRI manufacture, drugs designing, drug manufacture, plastic gloves manufacture, little-alcohol-rub-bottle-things-that-visitors-use-to-clean-their-hands manufacture, etc. 

You must surely see why this isn't a practical or cheaper solution. 

At the moment there's very little accountability for where money is spent since the government is picking up the bill and as everyone employed in the NHS knows the government is effectively a bottomless pit of money. Can the NHS afford to hire another Administrator to take on half my work load? It doesn't matter. Of course it can.

There's not enough accountability. 

This is where private companies are good. They fire useless employees and work existing employees more efficiently. 

It's unlikely that nurse staff or doctors would get fired. It'd be all the useless admin staff and NHS bureaucrats that'd get the chop. 

Germany and France use a private/nationalised system and their health care is much better than ours but works the same way (free at point of use).",0,1350423734,null,0,false,0,c6nh2be,t3_111fcq,t1_c6nh2be,t1_c6ng7hf,null,1430165386,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It wasn't phrased in such a way as to suggest there were alternatives. There is also the case of Azmael in *The Twin Dilemma*. To stop his possession by Mestor, he initiated a thirteenth regeneration specifically because he knew it would kill him.

Then again, the fact that the Valeyard was apparently to gain the remainder of the Doctor's regenerations had the trial ruled against him shows that they can be transferred somehow (perhaps similar to River's transfer to the Doctor), unless it would've involved body transference, similar to what the Master had attempted on 1999 Earth.",0,1350428512,null,0,false,0,c6nic2f,t3_11jscn,t1_c6nic2f,t1_c6ni978,null,1430165986,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I really do understand your guys frustrations, I said in my first post on him i am biased, I met him a few times times so Im always going to consciously/sub consciously defend him because I will always remember what he did for us not against us, kind of a positive way of looking at him, but (while i understand a lot of fans hatred) I do think him leaving to Chelsea has been blown wildly out of proportion. 

Even his comments about us I feel the majority of fans, sorry to say, REALLY are blowing them out of proportion, yes they may suck as a LFC fan to hear but I can understand why he's said them, I also understand why some people have dismissed them, he's in a shit situation where most LFC fans no longer like him and Chelsea fans only like him when he's scoring and he's done fuck all of that so he's getting heat from 2 sides.

Likewise, with the regenerations. I don't doubt your knowledge in the slightest. Rather, that it doesn't really matter in the end. The writers will do what they will, as they always have done.

Of course, your point may have been just to point out that the reasons I gave for why the regeneration limitation is cultural instead of biological is a fan-made idea rather than canon, and that seems to be perfectly valid given your citations. :)",0,1350428909,null,0,false,0,c6nifip,t3_11jscn,t1_c6nifip,t1_c6nic2f,null,1430166035,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

**Do I have to have an amazing job offer to move?**    
This can't be a requirement because we don't have amazing job offers. In fact, we don't have amazing anything. We only ever go as high as 'quite good'.

**Are there any major rights that Americans have and Brits don't?**    
We are not allowed to walk around with loaded guns, and holding up insulting banners at people's funerals is considered unsporting.

**How are Americans treated? Is there a stigma against Americans? Do we get made fun of often?**    
We treat them very well indeed, almost as well as our pets. Well, maybe a little bit. Yes, but mostly with affection.


**Where is the best place in the UK to live?**    
I would say Brighton. I might be biased though, because I don't live there and have only visited it once. I'm sure that once you get used to it, it's as disappointing and mundane as the rest of the UK.

&gt; if a player joins LFC and does well they are expected to stay there forever or until they are not as good as they once were and should a player decide to leave before the fans think its good, then they are a traitor.

To be honest, this isn't unique to just Liverpool fans, the majority of fans of midsized and up clubs, expect this of their players, however outdated that mindset may be.

 I completely agree that this is a stupid/outdated expectation to have in this money-first era of football, but I still think he could have left in a much classier way. I think the manner in which he left at the deadline(to a rival and especially the helicopter part) and the comments he made after leaving, really helped to add to the traitor label. I'm fine with a player leaving, even to semi-rival club, but I just want them to leave showing respect to the club when they do.

Are there any major rights that Americans have and Brits don't?  

They're very strict about gun licenses here from an American perspective I think. We have some limitations on speech that you don't (not allowed to incite violence based on racial and religious hatred, stricter libel laws...) and we don't get to vote for our head of State, which bothers some people. There may be a few more but I can't think of anything major. 

There are a few rights that we have that Americans don't:

We only have jaywalking laws on motorways/highways (except in Northern Ireland) and pedestrians have right of way on official crossing points.

We have 'the 'freedom to roam' or 'the everyman's right.' It's the right of public access to certain areas of public or private land. 

//In England and Wales public access rights apply to certain categories of mainly uncultivated land—specifically ""mountain, moor, heath, down and registered common land."" Developed land, gardens and certain other areas are specifically excluded from the right of access. Agricultural land is accessible if it falls within one of the categories described above. Most publicly owned forests have a similar right of access by virtue of a voluntary dedication made by the Forestry Commission. People exercising the right of access have certain duties to respect other people's rights to manage the land, and to protect nature.
In Scotland the freedom to roam may take the form of general public rights which are sometimes codified in law. The access is ancient in parts of Northern Europe and has been regarded as sufficiently basic that it was not formalised in law until modern times.//

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam#Right_to_roam_in_the_United_Kingdom

We don't have the death penalty for any crime and we won't extradite someone to a country where they'd face the death penalty for their particular crime. 

The rights of UK and the US citizens have a shared pedigree, so there's lots in common as well.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights_of_Englishmen 

How are Americans treated? It rather depends on how they behave. 

Where is the best place in the UK to live? Plenty of places, but I'd not worry about that until you've got an idea of what kind of budget you're going to have. London isn't all expensive but if you want any amount of space it probably would be. If you're prepared to live in a box you might be able to afford central London on an average wage. Personally, I'd say live by the sea in a coastal city, to really get the feel of being on an Island.

How do I go about moving? Worry about logistics later. In the mean time make plans to visit.


Should I attempt to gain citizenship right away? If you're still here after the requisite number of years you can consider it. 

SHOULD I DO IT?  

What makes you want to move apart from football? Maybe there's somewhere closer to home that will suit instead?
