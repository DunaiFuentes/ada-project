true,grandhotel89,null,null,"I think Walcott is a decent player, but I am dubious about signing more big-name players on free transfers after the Joe Cole situation. What I mean is that while you don't pay a fee for a player, they end up with such high wages that they're impossible to move on should you want to later. I say this without having done any math or real calculations, but it seems pretty clear that Joe got paid a pretty huge wedge because there was no fee to Chelsea, and money that would have gone there ended up in his pocket. 

Granted this situation is very different given Walcott's age compared to Cole's and perhaps I'm just being once bitten, twice shy.

And perhaps I'm also cynical, but all the talk below about his desire to play through the middle and how he's a Liverpool fan doesn't seem like it will matter in the end -- this is a financial disagreement that Arsenal can choose to resolve with him, or another club will resolve for them. Like I said, I'd prefer not to see us get dragged into another huge wage situation that turns into an albatross around our neck in a few years.

He is Average,  and Averages is what teams like Sunderland look for.  He is a finisher, ill stretch and say 40g in 150 games can give him a little credit (even though it has been on a world top team).  Back up Striker? LOL - you think he is leaving Chelsea to be a backup?  Winger WOW.  We have a winger that can get 12 assists  in 150 total games - his name is Stuart Downing, and i think we know how that worked out (yes, Sturridge has only assisted 12 times in that stretch).  I understand the situation is getting near critical, but we shouldn't throw our money around at mediocre (at best) players.  I would MUCH rather play Gerrard up top (false forward) than bring in some random dude to fill a spot.  Liverpool need a real striker ( praying Llorente goes there - 1% chance =( lol ).  Suarez can easily play the wing when another ST plays up top.  A player who would be unreal would be a player like Muniain.  He is a real winger.

All im saying is that there are a lot of options for Liverpool - more than one might think, and buying the backup to Fernando Torres - a player we sold - and an out of form player who is chosen in front of the player we are talking about, is NOT the answer.  It's just another money sink.

They're 19 and clueless. They've never looked after anyone or anything in their lives because either their mums did it all for them or they're from backgrounds where nobody did it at all.

Having been throwing internalised hissy fits about ""why should I wash his shit up?"" since the end of summer the end result has been that none of it got done and they have instead chosen to live in encrusted filth and laugh about it rather than confront each other and deal with the problem that is slowly but inexorably chipping away at their self esteem.

Whilst they superficially agree with each other that this is what being a student is all about they're actually poorly formed conflict averse human beings who can neither look after themselves nor state to others their views on how things should be. They're all going along with it to avoid being seen as gay. At least two of them don't like football but regurgitate borrowed opinions on it for exactly the same reason.

The refs in football/soccer control way less of the result of the match than the other sports",0,1356028098,null,0,false,0,c7jp0sx,t3_155zyl,t1_c7jp0sx,t1_c7jox0w,null,1430728596,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;If I read you correctly you're saying it's ok to rant about gypsies and be racist towards them 

Nope, I said it's okay to rant about aspects of their culture and that it isn't a race issue.  Here, have an example:  *Saudi Arabia's treatment of women is despicable.*  Does that make me racist?  No.  Now, how in the world does anybody identify a gypsy?  How on earth does anybody even identify a gypsy caravan site from a regular caravan site?

They're only identifiable by culture and lifestyle choice - and that puts criticism of Gypsies in the same league as criticism of Saudi Arabia for its treatment of women.  Not Necessarily Racist.

&gt;I can direct you to numerous threads on Reddit calling for their extermination entirely

Can you direct me to these threads where that isn't voiced by a dingbat and where the majority, even a significant minority, support this view?

&gt;to tar them all with a single brush, because it's the ""culture"" people don't like and not the actual race?

Same question goes to you as the other commenter with honesty issues.

*How do people identify gypsies without talking or approaching them?*

They can only identify a gypsy by actions, when they start acting outside what are considered the norms of society and culture.

&gt;Your race is not a lifestyle choice. 

No it is not, which is why it is not racism.  A gypsy could reject the gypsy lifestyle and nobody would be any the wiser that he was born a gypsy, and care even less.  They'd be utterly indifferent. 

&gt;The message underneath it is still ""Gyppos Out"" no matter what kind of UKIP Oxford Educated xenophobic veneer you tack onto it.

It most certainly is not, I even said I advocated changing the law and convention to accommodate the Gypsy style of life so it can be easily observed to be contributing as many other cultures do.  I say I have ""sympathy for the traveller lifestyle"" and you say I mean 'Gyppos out'?  It strikes me that you're far to quick to cry victim and have lost objectivity.  You're certainly to quick in flipping the furniture when it comes laying this ethnicity accusation at UKIPian feet before reading the article.  It's about the two UKIP foster parents who most definitely saw past ethnicity now it transpires the children they welcomed into their home were Roma.

You're making into a race issue, or trying to, because that's the silver bullet argument that slays all beasties.  People identify gypsies by their actions, and their traveller lifestyle doesn't lend itself to (a) holding down a well salaried job, or (b) a high level of education, so yes, people judge/identify them by actions and have reason to be wary if they show signs of affluence i.e. ostentatious jewellery, big cars.

Nothing to do with race because people can only identify them by their actions.

Another thing you have to realize is that Sturridge, by playing on the right is being played out of position, thus he has played as a striker plenty of time in that span of games so criticizing his assists is a bit unfair.

And somewhere there's a long line of Turks, Greeks, Italians, Balkans and other Mediterranean types that are constantly being harassed and mistaken for being a Roma Gypsy?  You could put a Roma person in a line up of Mediterranean people and it'd be like playing Pin The Tail On The Donkey trying to identify them.  Wouldn't even have to be Mediterranean types.  Here you go, spot the [Romani](http://allstarstribute.com/ESW/Images/Joe_Longthorne_002.jpg?xcache=8394).

Somehow I don't think either of these are the case.  I think that there's a problem because people somehow *can* identify a white traveller and Roma completely apart from their ethnicity.  That ethnicity doesn't even come into it.

That this has nothing to do with ethnicity whatsoever.

true,Endiny,tardis,TARDIS,"Sorry for the picture quality, I'm not good with a camera and couldn't get the lighting to look right. It was made worse because of the various glues/fabric paints I used - they seemed to cause a fair bit of glare.

Materials used:

* journal - just bought one the right size from the store. This one had a fake leather/vinyl cover with a bit of padding behind it. THe various types of glue I tried did NOT stick well to this, so I would recommend something with a different cover if you try it yourself.
* Blue fabric - I found some sort of synthetic satiny stuff that was the right color. I used the back of the fabric since it was a bit lighter in color than the front, and it had the rough vertical lines (which I thought looked cool.) It was thick enough that I had a lot of grief forming it around the shapes, so a lighter/stretchier type of fabric might have been a better choice.
* Tagboard - I cut the shapes for the cover out of tagboard, and ended up using 4 layers to get the depth I wanted. Big pain, I would use less layers or maybe get some type of foam if I ever did it again.
* Glue - Used a few types. Superglue worked well to glue the tagboard shapes to the journal cover - but set too fast to try to use it on the fabric (and it easily bled through the fabric.) I used tacky glue to glue the fabric to the shapes and journal cover, but wasn't too happy with how it behaved. I had to use a lot to get everything to work, which caused a bit of bleedthrough and very long drying times.
* I wanted to lighten up the raised portions of the fabric, so I mixed up some fabric paint my wife uses to a nice tardis blue. I didn't compensate enough for the dark background though, and it ended up making the pained portions even darker. It also gives it an odd sheen in the light that I didn't like.

Construction:

* I referenced a printable pdf you can get from the bbc site [here](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/d11s01/d11s02e04-dust-jacket.pdf) to draw out the shapes for the texturing. I just freehanded things (since I wanted a rugged/used look) but I heard of others resizing and printing it for a template. 
* I then cut out the shapes in the tagboard with an xacto knife, but found that I needed several layers (4) to get a noticeable shape through the fabric. I carefully glued the shapes to the journal cover with superglue.
* The nice folks a Michaels suggested [tacky glue](http://themaskedcrafter.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/tacky-glue.jpg) for use with the journal cover, since most of the other stuff I had on hand didn't work well. It was effective, but not very good at holding the fabric in place, and I had to use a lot of it (which made drying times very long and in some places soaked through the fabric and was visible.)
* Struggled to get the fabric to fit in the grooves between the shapes, with the type of glue I used and the thickness fo the fabric, this was a chore and very time consuming.
* Made a poor decision to paint the raised parts a little lighter.

""Gareth, there's always going to be rumors about Madrid or Barcelona or some other huge team wanting you. You're an amazing player and amazing players attract attention. Now, you're going to get paid here, so that's not an issue, but think about it like this: If you go to Madrid or Barcelona or wherever, you can be a great player, and maybe win a few trophies, but you'll just be another great player on teams with histories of amazing players.

I've been stopped by the police while trying to LEAVE the country, and then stopped by police when trying to return to the country.

My faith in the police was shaken a long time ago. Perhaps the first time i was stopped, as a 13/14 year old on my bike. They took my name, address, and all my details, and when i asked if he could tell me why (Incredibly politely, i might add. I always was at that age), he laughed in my face and said No. Incredibly embarrassing &amp; emasculating to a kid of my age.

I'm lucky enough to have only been pulled over once in the year and a bit I was driving. They wouldnt give me any explanation then either. 

I've never had a good experience with the police. And please understand, I have plenty reason to believe it has something to do with the colour of my skin.

But i feel for us all, no one's safe from their lies &amp; conspiracy. Not even those in charge of our country, which i find incredibly amusing.

I think it's insulting to people with actual mental health issues. My house in uni was as bad as that (except without the puke and mould). So were lots of my friends, and not all of them were students. That house actually looks far nicer underneath than most I've seen. You could probably have it clean with a couple of hours of hard graft. My uni house was a death trap and the landlord didn't give a flying fuck, he made about 2k/month and wouldn't even turn up to do basic repairs. As long as he got his cash he didn't care. Lots of uni landlords deal with this shit, it's not ideal I know, but the profits are good, that's why people do it. When you have 4-5 blokes living together in a shit house, who are even mildly lazy or smoke to much weed and have busy degree courses, it's easy for it to build up. I personally hated it, as did one of my other housemates, but after battling it for months you eventually just give up. I just kept my bedroom as a sanctuary and the let the rest of the house go to wall. 

I don't understand how you came to the conclusion 'it will hit them in their mid 20's' either. By their mid 20's most of my housemates who were disgusting in uni in their own ways were working successful jobs and living in decent houses. The biggest slob/football banter/destructive idiot in my house is now a senior spacecraft engineer, on a 100k+ and lives in a penthouse flat. The others are all normal working professionals.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; According to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, police officers are 37 times more likely to stop and search a black person than a white person under Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act.

This statistic is widely bandied around, but is very misleading, because Section 60 is [only one of a multitude of acts which permit stop and search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_and_search#Search_without_arrest). The vast majority of stop-and-searches occur [through Section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/883680/stops-searches-jpg) (source for the graph [here](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/police-research/police-powers-procedures-201011/stops-searches-1011)), not Section 60 (of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act).

Section 60 is unique in that it allows searches without reasonable suspicion. The idea is that a Section 60 cordon can be put up in violent crime hotspots, and basically searching can be so thorough that it becomes impossible to regularly carry knives or guns in those areas. These high crime inner city areas tend to be heavily populated by ethnic minorities, presumably because of historic prejudice, entrenched poverty and social exclusion, and the consequent emergence of gang culture. The real debate is whether it is appropriate to use powers in this way, and whether it fosters more animosity than other forms of policing. The Met may well be racist in its conduct, that may be a reason why Section 60 is unwise, but the statistics quoted do not prove them to be so.

Edit: Just to add, it seems that what I'm describing above is how Section 60 is being used by the police, but the original legislation was not intended for that purpose. Originally they could only set up the cordoned area for 24 hours, and it was targeted at football hooliganism and specific gang fight events. Read about it here:

Daleks in Manhatten/Evolution of the Daleks. Great attempt to try and ruin the oldest villains in the series... Thankfully it failed. 

Less bad, but still not that great (in my opinion): The Unicorn and The Wasp. It was a pretty good story, but I just didn't like the concept of the alien and such. If that was anything better, it would have actually been a *great* story imo.

The Girl Who Waited: The entire problem only happened because of a mistake no one would realistically make. No one arrives on an alien planet, sees a mysterious door with TWO BUTTONS and doesn't bother to ask *anything* about it.

I don't think it does, at least on nowhere near the scale that is being suggested, for two very clear reasons:

* Section 60 only makes up about 10% of the total stop-and-searches in Britain, so only considering this data gives a very partial picture. The rest of stops are done using different legislation, which has a much reduced ratio between black and white.

* The vast majority of Section 60 stop- and-searches (about 90%) happen in Metropolitan London, where the racial demographics are completely different to the rest of the country, which gives a false picture when you take a country-wide average. Black people make up 20% of the London population, and 2% of the UK population. Assume for a moment that all UK stop-and-searches happened within London, and that within London the percentages were completely fair. That would mean once you took a UK average, it would indicate that black people were ten times more likely to be stopped (just the ratio between 2% and 20%). But it's clear this would not be a fair representation of the real situation.

Most of the data is here:

Nonsense—this is baseless superstition. Next you'll say the printing press killed writing, the gramophone killed live music, or the tape recorder killed the movie business. You might try and claim manufacturing would never have happened without the patent system... oh wait! When was Archimedes born again? What about Da Vinci? What about today's fashion industry? They don't have copyright, does that mean they can't exist? What about the food industry? Have people stopped going to restaurants because they can copy the recipes back home?

&gt; You need money to make movies, and you don't get money if everybody consumes your product for free.

The shared cultural wealth that goes into any piece of art nullifies any claim of ownership an artist might desperately claim to exist. About a million years of proto-human and human history was required to make that film possible—every word uttered was forged by a trillion prior uses, every note played in a song has been sung trillions of times. You don't need much money to make a film, you need a camera (400 quid?) and imagination (Priceless.).

&gt; and those playrights were not supporting an industry which required money to run

Yes, they did. TV wasn't invented so live performance was a key entertainment. Actors need food too ya know? You seem not to understand copyright: we are supposed to believe the rational is to promote innovation. What it isn't is a right to make profit, however, that is exactly what it actually is! Do you follow?

*[""The copyright monopoly is not a natural right. It is a government-sanctioned private monopoly, granted under the assumption that no culture would get created if there’s not a profit motive behind it, and that this profit motive can only be realized in a monopolized setting.""](http://torrentfreak.com/the-copyright-monopoly-is-a-market-distortion-not-a-birthright-121216/)*

At least for adopted children of *visible* ethnicity - black, asian, &amp;c - it's considered fairly important now they're placed with families of the same race. There was a good BBC documentary a year or two ago which touched on this - it was about an adoptee girl, who came to the UK as one of the ""boat people"", who returned to Vietnam to seek her birth parents. Adopting kids to parents of  a different ethnicity has shown to lead to some identity issues - I don't really know the details, but it's best practice now to avoid it. 

I know Reddit doesn't like to think of the Roma as a race, but they're classified as such, so that's why it's important their race and culture are treated respectfully by social services. Basically, everyone involved is thinking of their legacy and they don't want history books in 50 years' time to be saying ""look at how these meddling assholes addressed crime and social issues in a culture that wasn't their own - they went in and destroyed the Roma people"".

So? You still got ahold of it without paying for the DVD/CD.

&gt;Nonsense—this is baseless superstition. Next you'll say the printing press killed writing, the gramophone killed live music, or the tape recorder killed the movie business. You might try and claim manufacturing would never have happened without the patent system... oh wait! When was Archimedes born again? What about Da Vinci? What about today's fashion industry? They don't have copyright, does that mean they can't exist? What about the food industry? Have people stopped going to restaurants because they can copy the recipes back home?

Not at all the same thing, again. I'm talking about if everyone just torrented instead of paying for the movie - they would earn no money, make a loss on every film, and be unable to fund any more. Your food example is another nonsense one - people aren't re-making blockbusters themselves and then watching them, they're taking the original movie.

&gt;Yes, they did. TV wasn't invented so live performance was a key entertainment. Actors need food too ya know? 

Again, different. Everyone could perform the plays, which audiences then paid to see. The genuine equivalent would be if people took the scripts home and just read those, and didn't go to the plays. Your analogies are pretty much all ridiculous and don't fit the situation in any way.

&gt;You can't ""take and keep"" something and yet have that same something existing in the place of origin.

Nonsense, and again just semantics. My original point was that when you get the file, you then have it to keep, which was a response to an earlier point of yours. Whether or not the original file still exists is irrelevant, because my point was about that not mattering - you still possess the film/song now, and haven't paid for it.

&gt;Yes, yes you are—you are copying on some level not stealing. 

Still more semantics. When you torrent, you are duplicating the file *exactly*, and then you own what other people paid for, for free. That is not the same as any of your examples.",0,1356047995,null,0,false,0,c7jukvq,t3_155twu,t1_c7jukvq,t1_c7jue85,null,1430731281,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Nonsense—for over 50 years Hollywood prospered on theatre tickets alone and that form of entertainment more than persists today. A Kickstarter where you get the money upfront is a totally viable business model.

&gt; make a loss on every film

They like to make a loss on every film, it helps them avoid paying taxes, and paying royalties to actors, but that is a different conversation.

&gt; Your food example is another nonsense one

It is spot on. Imagine Gordon Ramsey copyrighting the beef wellington or fish and chips. That is absurd! Again you are failing to understand copyright: it is ownership of the original and all copies and likenesses thereafter.

&gt; Again, different. Everyone could perform the plays, which audiences then paid to see.

Again, spot on. You are failing to understand copyright: it is ownership of the original, all copies, all public screenings, all public performances, and likenesses thereof. Yes, everyone could perform plays because scripts weren't copyrightable!

&gt; Nonsense, and again just semantics. My original point was that when you get the file, you then have it to keep, which was a response to an earlier point of yours. 

Nay, the semantic gymnastics are all yours my friend. You are defining the action as taking something, first you called it stealling, now you tacitly agree that it all is ""duplication"".

It's telling that you have no answer to the following, quoting myself:

&gt; The shared cultural wealth that goes into any piece of art nullifies any claim of ownership an artist might desperately want to exist. About a million years of proto-human and human history was required to make that film possible—every word uttered was forged by a trillion prior uses, every note played in a song has been sung trillions of times.

true,AnnieIWillKnow,EN,england,"I think this is one of the funniest things I have ever seen in my life. In a 'if you don't laugh you just might cry', sort of way.

&gt; Lowest ebb - you are talking nonsense - again he is our top scorer

I'm beginning to think you can't read. I was referring to the spell of games immediately before the Juventus match, where Torres was absolutely shocking. You know, when you would watch an entire match and not even see him, and when he refused to shoot, and threw about in a strop, when the entire footballing world decided the Torres experiment was a failure.

&gt; He is a play maker

We have plenty of play makers. Centre forwards should not be play makers. Centre forwards should be goal scorers, especially if you're up top on your own. We have players like Mata, Hazard, Oscar, Lamps, Ramires and David Luiz to set up plays. World class footballers should be able to play in more than one way, and Torres should be able to score goals with our plethora of playmakers behind him.

Torres has not scored enough important goals for us, Torres has not contributed enough. End of.

Can I ask, are you actually a Chelsea fan? Or are you a Torres fan? Because your level of devotion is such that I can't actually imagine you not following whichever club Torres is at. I mean, you're even willing to overlook the truth, such is your devotion. According to you, Torres has no flaws and has been a wonderful signing. He couldn't possibly do anything wrong, it's all the team! It's the other players that made Torres miss sitters, like the one against United last year, or that one against Corinthians. It's the other players that make Torres lose possession all the time, and dribble towards the corner flag when he should be shooting! 

My favourite thing about your delusional, pathetic argument is that it centrally contradicts itself - you keep saying that Torres has scored enough goals, and has made a massive contribution to the team, and yet you also keep insisting that Torres' teammates are the ones to blame for his poor run of form... it can't be both! Either Torres is scoring a lot, and everything is hunky dory, or he's in bad form due to his team mates. Makes your delusions even more fun to read. 

&gt; his sheer fucking presence is enough to scare defenders and for them to up their game

I don't think I even need to comment on this. I don't think defenders are exactly shitting themselves at the thought of a centre forward who is terrified of shooting. 

&gt; This is why he scores more against supposed weaker teams, they do not have good enough defenders to deal with him.

So our £50m striker who is doing a wonderful job is easily dealt with my half-decent defenders? Marvellous. Contradicts what you said about him striking fear into the hearts of defenders everywhere, to begin with.

And that clusterfuck of a last paragraph...

&gt; they are a better *team* and they do not rely on the concept of having one centre foward who scores all the goals

Good job we don't have a center forward like that then.

We are not watching Mike Basset and 4-4-2.  This is Chelsea football club with some of the best footballing talent on this planet today, playing some of the best (or attempting) possession football on this planet today and Fernando Torres is a massive important part of it.

If you want to watch a team with a classic centre forward, Drive down the M4 and watch Swansea and Mitchu who currently sit in 10th position despite him being the top goal scorer at this moment in time.

Can anyone honestly guarantee that after 7 years they wouldn't have conditioned themselves in to a bit of a complex? Rationalised ones own failures or fears about (re)joining the workforce? Maybe to give yourself a degree of psychological comfort in the face of feeling utterly worthless?

I personally give the guy a touch of credit for having the gall needed to face the presenter. I think it's understandable, but a shame, that she got angry... because all it did is make the listener feel good for having had her ostracise him on their behalf, instead of enlighten us further. There's a chilling sense of bullying here rather than concern.

This is false, the cinema sees an expression of light passed through coloured paper at an extremely high resolution onto a giant reflective screen. The 720p rip is expressed through binary encoding and different dimensions then via active LCD small scale displays. A film also has many levels of existence: static binary patterns on magnet disk, static voltage patterns in volatile memory, changing pixel data over* time expressed through an LCD, and finally the reconstruction through sensory perception inside the brain. Very quickly you get into a non-trivial existential quandary of what it means for a film to exist let alone allowed to be private property.

&gt; Your beef wellington is not identical to Gordon Ramsey's beef wellington.

Copyright holders own all originals and copies thereafter—you own the idea not just the physical expression (ie molecules). If Gordon Ramsey was to invent the Beef Swellington no other person would be able to reproduce that, if food could be copyrightable. That's a direct and sound equivalence formalised as such:

* [X] has copyrighted [Y] therefore no one is allowed to reproduce [Y].
* [Ramsey] has copyrighted the [Beef Swellington] therefore no one is allowed to reproduce the [Beef Swellington].
* [Sony] has copyrighted [Looper] therefore no one is allowed to reproduce [Looper].

If I make the Beef Swellington and let friends eat it I have done the equivalent of file sharing, and infringed on the commercial monopoly granted to Ramsey by the state. In the current climate, if I do my own rendition of what ever song and share it with people, I am in breach of copyright.

&gt; If you make and film your own version of Looper, with the neighbour lady as the love interest, and some guy from the gym as Bruce Willis.

And who owns the copyright to that new work of art? In the case of Looper, Sony is graned ownership, I shit you not. Share that film and you are committing copyright infringement.

&gt; Downloading the original for free is not the same.

You don't download the original, what you have is a likeness. There is no transfer of the original.

true,captainlavender,smith,Smith,"Well I can't give you everyone's opinion but I can give you *my* opinions, if that helps at all. Here, let's go chronologically:

The beginning of series 1 is awful, starting with Rose. Also not too fond of The End of the World, or the Unquiet Dead. Having trouble explaining why. Maybe the writing? But I mean, plastic!Mickey? Evil mannequins? Yikes. Then of course, the Slitheen episodes: again, writing. With these early episodes I have trouble pinpointing the problems because it's just a general sense of awfulness. Though the farting aliens didn't help matters. At least we get Harriet Jones!

S2 has some weak but not actually bad episodes, like New Earth and School Reunion (the latter made more painful by all the wonderful actors involved, very sad), and the Idiot's Lantern. Love and Monsters is *not a bad episode*. Really. It just has a horrible villain and a stupid-as-fuck ending. 80% of the episode is still lovely, if you ask me.

S3 also had a few mediocre episodes (Smith and Jones, The Lazarus Experiment) but its biggest problems were Daleks in Manhattan (which reached new levels of camp -- ""You must obey me! I am daaaaalek sek!"") and the finale, which was in many ways awesome (the creepiness of the toclefane, the Master dancing maniacally) but in some ways incredibly sucktastic (old Timelords look like parakeets? wha?).

Series four didn't have any outright stinkers, but Sontaran episodes were pretty joyless, and the Unicorn and the Wasp was an excellent episode spoiled by a stupid villain. Opinions vary on the fourth season finale, I understand, but I bought it, stupid tribal action-music notwithstanding.  

Series' 4 and 5 are the strongest seasons in NuWho, IMO, and s5 was overall excellent -- even Victory of the Daleks wasn't really objectionable, just kind of dumb. That said, the Hungry Earth two-parter failed in many ways, and the Angel two-parter, while good, utterly botched the Angel mythology. 

Series 6 has a lot of weak points. The Curse of the Black Spot, obviously. The Flesh episodes could've just been one, although I enjoy the creepiness of the second episode. A Good Man Goes to War is actually awful, except for the brilliant ending with River. (No, really. Rewatch it. It's bad.) Let's Kill Hitler should've been two, and Night Terrors... ugh. There might be more bad than good in series 6, sad to say. Well, at least we got The Doctor's Wife, the Girl Who Waited, and the God Complex.

Those are my opinions! I have many more if you're interested =)",0,1356058526,null,0,false,0,c7jx4n5,t3_156hgg,t1_c7jx4n5,t3_156hgg,null,1430732482,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,Mastaduhbater1,null,null,"Well, there would be a fair amount of import substitution arguments in order to foster growth of domestic industry and justify tarriffs on imported goods. Import substitution however is now always good.

For instance, lets look at South Korean televisions. If we were to implement a tarriff on imported televisions and subsidize and support domestic manufacturing to invest in and produce them, it would mean that, entire perpheral industries would need to be created on a massive scale. So the chips, processors, PCBs, LEDs, injection moulding, screw machining would flourish. 

Now, would you rather have a larger proportion of jobs in Walmart or a job machining screws and other parts for manufacture? Who would pay more?  

Would you rather be running an injection moulding machine, or be a cashier? 

Would you rather be a stock boy or would you rather be welding diodes to emitters using ultra high tech microscopes?

Would you rather be flipping burgers, or would you rather be trained to measure complex parts? 

The only disadvantage to this is that overall trade volume would decline by a marginal amount due to demand elasticity, but does it matter? Look, people are working. 

The economic history of Argentina is a GREAT example of how having an imbalanced approach to trade can result in stagnation and poor quality and selection of consumer goods. Please see link:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_Argentina

Gordon, I feel you would need to balance this carefully and be highly selective about which industries to foster and how to foster them. 

Now lets read over the economic history of South Korea

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-Year_Plans_of_South_Korea

Now notice how the government was organized and realized in which ways to respond to the competitive rise in China. Keep in mind, their labor costs are very close to the UK. Slightly less, but these guys are doing incredibly well. China didn't eat their breakfast. WHY???

BECAUSE THEY HAD A FRIGGIN PLAN!!

From friends who have done their masters at UoL institutions, the university provided accommodation is a bit hit and miss. It's certainly cheaper than private halls, but you will always be able to rent cheaper by shopping around london (I appreciate that's a bit difficult if you're stateside).

true,ravniel,num11,,"I wrote a huge wall of text about how I think Levy gets less criticism than I think he deserves for his approach to the transfer market, but it was honestly absurdly long even for one of my posts, so I'm just going to post the incredibly short version:

I'm extremely grateful for all the good Levy has done and I think he made a brilliant choice with AVB, but I don't think it should be forgotten that he kind of let AVB down in the transfer window this summer.  His commitment to late deals and lowball negotiating tactics meant that we started the season with no creative central midfielder in the squad, and even though we did bring in Dembele we missed out on signing Moutinho by **hours**.  There's no real excuse for that.  His commitment to shaving pounds off the prices of Vertonghen and Lloris also ensured that those negotiations lasted far, far longer than they needed to, and in both cases I think we're frankly very lucky the deals weren't scuppered.  Players of that caliber - especially Vertonghen, who attracted concrete interest from one other big club and frankly should've attracted more - are worth overpaying for a little to ensure that the deal is done in a timely fashion.

Anyway, this isn't to say Levy's shit or anything, I just think Spurs fans have committed to an ""In Levy We Trust"" narrative that he hasn't always deserved.  We have a very thin squad in some key positions and he's partially to blame for that.

I've of the opinion that gun control does not effect violent crime in either of the extremes. And like most crime is more effected by other factors. Having spoke to many American gun owners (being one myself, I found it interesting) I found they value personal liberty over social security, something many brits don't understand and factor into their debate. 

With that said, I don't think brits or Europeans really ""get it"" we can rehash the same old statistics, tired arguments and random hypothetical situations people seem to pull out of their ass but it won't matter when (IMO) the firearm seems to be a physical representation  of personal freedom and liberty . It's a mindset which is consistently failed to be represented in debates making them pointless. Gun control, like all crime related statistics is so damn complicated its hard enough talking about our own country let alone another. 

We will never fully ""get"" or understand the mindset/culture behind the ownership there making our opinions somewhat irrelevant.

Gun control might ""work"" here but we never had a massive culture in the first place, we are a tiny island nation which helps. Even if a ban is placed, good luck taking the how ever many hundreds of millions of weapons.

I actually envy certain aspects or American gun culture, the idea that the government can't tell you you can't own a semi automatic 7.62 battle rifle gives the libertarian in me a freedom boner. The idea of self reliance and protection being first and foremost  also gives me a libertarian rock on. But the effects of this style of ownership is complicated and I don't think our culture could handle it.",0,1356074508,null,0,1356088690,0,c7k0rmz,t3_157lyu,t1_c7k0rmz,t3_157lyu,null,1430734197,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

His thread was immediately found by pro gun. trolls and I spent the next four days arguing with them while they made some of the most irrational and unfounded claims.

There most persuasive point was that while gun crime and murder is very high on the US the overall crime rate is lower. Not the most convincing argument really as there is no evidence whether this is correlation or causation.

He then said that 20 people had been shot and murdered in Chicago this week and that is why he needs a gun.  That sounds fucking stupid to me but there you go as clearly guns were the reason for these murders.

As for guns, I have no problem with them.  Me and a fiend used to go out on his farm with a shot gun and blow away crows for fun.

With that said, I don't think brits or Europeans really ""get it"" we can rehash the same old statistics, tired arguments and random hypothetical situations people seem to pull out of their ass but it won't matter when (IMO) the firearm seems to be a physical representation of personal freedom and liberty . 

It's a mindset which is consistently failed to be represented in debates making them pointless. Gun control, like all crime related statistics is so damn complicated its hard enough talking about our own country let alone another. We will never fully ""get"" or understand the mindset/culture behind the ownership there making our opinions somewhat irrelevant. Gun control might ""work"" here but we never had a massive culture in the first place, we are a tiny island nation which helps. Even if a ban is placed, good luck taking the how ever many hundreds of millions of weapons.

 I actually envy certain aspects or American gun culture, the idea that the government can't tell you you can't own a semi automatic 7.62 battle rifle gives the libertarian in me a freedom boner.

You didn't watch much of Chelsea under Mourinho, did you. Cole was a starting 11 player in both seasons when they won the EPL (49 and 47 appearances). The year they came second was when Mourinho and Cole had their argument, and he started only 3 Premier League games, but when Ancelloti came in and won the league, Cole was back to being a regular 11 again (32 EPL starts!) and they won the league.

There is a reason why Cole had a solid reputation before he moved to Liverpool, and that is because he was a pillar in one of the most exciting teams in the world that were winning everything. You can hassle Cole for being paid too much, for underperforming, for not fitting into the squad, but you really can't criticize his history. He has accomplished more than the rest of the Liverpool squad, has more natural skill than most of the Liverpool squad and is highly rated, on the record, by one of the best managers in the world.

When the Cole move happen a lot of pundits already knew it would go wrong. Not because he is a terribly player, but because of the role Mourinho had found for Cole just wouldn't work at Liverpool. A lot of people knew it at the time. Other people who don't know what they are talking about took that to mean that Cole is crap, which he is not.

Yes as per usual(the last windows) Tottenham are after the same talent as we are because they seem to have the same budget and the difference in scouting is not that huge of a difference. Newcastle is also looking for this talent, but I only see Spurs as the real contenders because they have the ability to finish top 3 with their squad if they have a bit of luck.

Granted, I don't think the US is about to ban guns any time soon.  Apart from anything else, ownership is so widespread, it would be practically impossible to enforce.  But just having to show ID to buy bullets seemed a little crazy to me.  Americans I've spoken to seem to find it difficult to grasp how difficult it is to obtain bullets in the UK, never mind guns.

Unlike many Brits, I have, in fact, fired guns (at cardboard boxes, not any living thing - for anybody who's wondering, the bang is far louder, and the recoil far more powerful than tv and films have had us believe).  I find it somewhat like riding rollercoasters.  I can see why people want to do it, there is a certain thrill involved, but it's definitely not something I want to do with any regularity.  I certainly did not feel any safer knowing there were guns in the house.  If anything, I felt that it increased the danger of any situation, because I felt it could escalate way too quickly.

In the UK, if an intruder enters your house with a weapon, it's likely to be a knife.  You can run away, throw something at him, grab a heavy object and hit him with it... injuries are incurred, but nobody is all that likely to die.  In the US, whether it's the intruder who has the gun, the homeowner, or both, it's probably going to end in tragedy for someone.

&gt;I am allowed a gun, as a holder of a full firearms licence. Requirement of supervising a bunch of Scouts when they were going for a rifle badge.  
However, I don't want one for my home. Don't get me wrong, I'm one of the ""ideal"" people to have one. I'm trained, a rather good shot, and know proper maintenance and safety (have to really, father-in-law owns a hunting shop in Norway, and it's always interested me).

&gt;But the prospect of having a live firearm in the house? No thanks. Not only would it most likely be a breach of my tenancy agreement (Although a functional sword, fencing foils, and soon-to-have a couple of recurve bows and arrows aren't somehow), the point of escalation would be immense.

&gt;A little background if I may. I live in a very small city, quite possibly one of the world's smallest official cities. I live in a nice, quiet area of that city. Very little crime, and everyone has alarms. If someone were to break in, there would be no reason to have a point of escalation like a firearm. Deterrent factor in my little cul-de-sac is immense as it is, without word getting around that my house has a legally held firearm in it.
So, basically, I do have the legal choice of if I want a gun in the house or not, and I choose not to.

To build on that, you have the concept of escalation. Generally speaking, if you're going to rob someone, hold them up, or anything like that, you would either want surprise, or to be better tooled up than they are. If every householder in the country has a handgun, then you would likely want a sawn-off. Hearing that, a lot of the population would then escalate to something bigger, possibly a proper shotgun, or multiple high calibre handguns. Criminal aspects would get wind of the tooling up of the locals, and may equally seek weaponry.

The other thing I would say to the vehemently pro-gun people would be this. The second amendment is flawed in modern society on two counts. One, it states as a *well-regulated militia*, which is an oxymoron (Yes, I'm aware of SC 2008/2010 and them ignoring active amendment wordings). Secondly, it was written at a time where the Union was fragile at best, and the lawmakers foresaw several situations where the government *would* need to be disposed of, which is not the case any more.",0,1356082256,null,0,false,0,c7k1v01,t3_157ozw,t1_c7k1v01,t3_157ozw,null,1430734797,8,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,8

In this case it is apparent that Liverpool have leaked this story since the narrative is that if they can't land the Ince deal, they will move on. 

The way it is phrased is all from a Liverpool perspective, for eg.

&gt; a fee of £4million, which is considerably more than the £250,000 Blackpool paid when they took Ince from Anfield only 16 months ago.

A clear message to Blackpool - settle now or we are looking elsewhere. I believe that is exactly what they will do. The other clubs interested in him won't bother bidding it up since Liverpool has the advantages of the 35% discount, knowing when a bid is accepted (since they are a counterparty) and being the club that Ince wants to move to.

I wouldn't take too many of these stories literally, it is all part of playing games while negotiations continue. We saw the same thing with Carroll (eg. BR saying that he could stay, even though we all knew he was on his way out) and it is no different here.

I don't feel the need to watch a team with a classic centre forward, but I do feel the need to watch a team with a centre forward who makes more of his chances, and inspires more confidence from the rest of his team and the fanbase. When Torres has a chance, I, along with most people, am never confident he will convert it. Compare that to someone like Van Persie or Falcao, or even Torres 3 years ago. You think I don't understand modern football, and yet you seem to be failing completely to understand everything I've been saying about Torres.

I don't think he's shit, and I don't think we can judge whether or not he is a flop yet, as his Chelsea career isn't over, but he has been incredibly disappointing. Even this season, when he is our top scorer, he has suffered the kind of droughts that have characterised his career so far - like going 10 hours of game time without a goal, and not scoring for 8 PL games. He cannot go missing like this, and yet he does, again and again.

We studied the spending of forty English clubs between 1978 and 1997, and found that their outlay on transfers explained only 16 percent of their total variation in league position. By contrast, their spending on salaries explained a massive 92 percent of that variation. In the 1998-2007 period, spending on salaries by clubs in the Premier League and the Championship… still explained 89 percent of the variation in league position. It seems that high wages help a club much more than do spectacular transfers.”

Soccernomics. THe studies are robust and technically sound. I believe that the method they used doesn't account for success in later seasons and is therefore going to undersetimate correlation with success however it helps you realise that transfer spending is not the be all and end all.

I am defending him, pointing out his record, stating that defenders fear him and that he is scoring and doing well. 

He is not incredibly disappointing, he could be scoring more goals, however - he is delivering and he is good enough, considering how Chelsea Football club are playing football this year.

Mate, Arsenal sit fifth in the Premier League and are still in the European Champions League.  Implying Arsenals defence are shit, not shit enough to qualify for the last 16 of the Champions League.

true,k-dude,null,null,"Also, I suggest that you research American history more to understand why gun ownership is so important to your fellow countryman, liberal, conservative or libertarian, rather than asking us for confirmation bias as to why you shouldn't have guns.

Britain has never been a revolutionary nation. The establishment have always adapted to bring in dissenting opinions and placate them. See Disraeli's one nation conservatism and how Labour adopted gradualism. 

The United States of America on the other hand, is at present only in existance as a continued revolution. Govermment has never been looked to as the answer, but as the problem. There is an inherent mistrust of government deep rooted into American history and probably for good reason. The progressive era of Wilson and Teddy Roosevelt dramatically changed the size and type of the federal goverment, making it actually influence every Americans lives, instead of being merely an instrument for national defence. But the view of the people has not correlated at all with the actual scope of the federal government. Rather than changing from beneath as the British govermment did in the last one hundred years, there is a real perception (out of California, New York) that both parties have colluded in growing the size of the federal govenment and that bodies like the IRS are a nuisance, not a blessing.

Look at how well recieved the TSA, the DHS and FEMA have been recieved in the last decade, regardless of your own personal beliefs and you will start to understand the animosity. Americans don't want the federal government to become all powerful. Many look at the direction of NDAA, the Patriot Act and 'Obamacare' or ACA as signs that it is continuing to grow. 

Their Second Amendment therefore is not something to be viewed in terms of a utalitarian perspective or through a prism of moral harm. It is for them a fundamental right. Just like the Second Amendment. Just like the Fifth. And so on. They are things one can cling to as the federal government continues to grow uncosnstitutionaly. 

Instead of asking the UK, whose government, society and culture is vastly different from your own, you should read history books, go talk to people outside of California and New York, visit the guys at /r/guns , go to a firing range and learn more about your culture and history and what, in my view makes it a special thing.

I agree about the shock and that it would need to be a coalition of leading countries that make up the financial system to unwind of these GBP denominated derivatives which are one of the primary causes of the economic decline of the UK. The world uses your currency and your markets to drive up demand for your currency beyond a level which is suitable for manufacturing and thus generating real economic wealth. 

I do believe this would need to be done in stages, while also using SDRs to allow for an orderly decline of the pound. I think the key here would be that, in order to kickstart domestic manufacturing would be to drive market psychology to slowly anticipate the unwinding of the system in its current form over a long period with an uncertain window. This is key. Then slowly regulate the flow of capital in the financial industry and create other investment vehicles to drive domestic investment while slowly allowing the currency to depreciate. 

You would need to create massive industrial government influenced conglomerates much like the way the Chaebols of south korea are organized and drive heavy industry to support it. This will create expectation. 

Easier said than done, but believe me, it certainly CAN be done. 

China didn't eliminate boom and bust, they smoothened it out by stimulating different parts of the economy.

Having a spouse you can no longer relate to and being unable to adjust probably saw a good deal of depressed, lonely men (and women) in the decades following the war.

Also factor in the change in the role of women that took place during the war: many women took up the positions that previously only men had held, because there were far fewer men around to fill those jobs. Factory jobs for instance. Men who had left their good and obedient housewife at home returned to find her the by-default head of the household used to holding things together and much more independent.

That would mean that colleges like Downing, Pembroke, St. Catherine's or Emmanuel would be the closest reasonable-sized colleges, and they're all pretty nice. Bear in mind, though, that as a PhD student it's not guaranteed that you'd be living in college - this varies from college to college, but it's only really the bigger colleges that offer any postgrad accommodation, and I don't think any of them guarantee it.

To be honest, nowhere in Cambridge is very far away from anywhere else - if you get a bicycle, and I recommend you do, you can cycle from almost any college to almost any major university site in about 10-15 minutes tops. Unless you're going from Homerton to West Cambridge site, or something. If you *are* based in the main department, you can cycle there from anywhere other than Girton or Homerton very easily.

If I were you, I'd be more concerned with colleges that have a good grad scene - I know King's is very friendly and good at looking after foreign students, and that's central and big, so might well give you accommodation in the middle of town. I hear John's is pretty good for that too, but I only know one grad at John's right now, so that's a pretty small sample.

true,east_side_sunsets,null,null,"I'm copying this from something I posted on a similar thread a few days before Sandy Hook but:

""In the UK, it's rare for anyone to have unlicenced guns, which is precisely why shootings over here are also very rare. It is still considered newsworthy if someone is shot. We don't have school shootings. (There was Dunblane, in Scotland, but that was in 1996 and was not committed by a student, it was a 46 year old and the guns were legally held).


I see a lot of things on reddit which are almost pitying countries like mine for not having the ""freedom"" to bear arms, but the way I see it, I'd rather have the freedom to walk the streets safe in the knowledge that it is unlikely that anyone around me is carrying a potentially lethal firearm. I'd rather sacrifice my ""right"" to carry one and know that any old sociopath/depressed teenager/etc. can't just walk into a shop and buy one (I don't know much about US firearm laws but they seem exceptionally lax).""

-This is precisely the thing for me. People say a lot about ""oh yes but people will always use other weapons, there are loads of ways to kill people"" but, whilst that's true, it's not a reasonable argument because guns are so much more efficient and powerful than knives etc. The day of Sandy Hook there was also a school stabbing in China. No one died. Had the attacker had a gun, I seriously doubt the 20+ children he stabbed would all have survived. 

Furthermore, I don't think a lot of Americans understand how insane gun culture looks from an outsider perspective. Reading recent threads, I heard about ""gun-free school zones"" (I think that's right). You have no idea how mental it sounds from a UK perspective that someone had to actually pass laws to designate a school as being gun-free - of course they should be, they're full of children! And now in the light of the recent news I've even seen people suggest that that should be revoked, that the teachers should be armed. The whole thing seems insane. 

I'm hoping to teach primary in the future. I'm intensely grateful to live in the country where I don't have to consider and plan for these incidents, and even have people suggesting I arm myself to respond to them. I hope the gun laws in the UK never get less stringent, I feel infinitely safer the way things are.

Would we pay to police a high-street business that operated without counter staff and expected customers to leave payments for goods in honesty boxes? No, of course not... the very idea would be absurd! We might lament the fact that dishonest people make such a business model unworkable, but we would tell anyone who tried it to get real.

I'm not going to condemn anyone who treasures their right to bear arms, but I think the US needs greater regulation than it currently has and a tighter limit on the type of gun civilians are able to own.  

One thing that irks is the suggestion that this right is a sign of 'greater' freedom.  The idea that I am less free for not being able to have such a specific weapon, while I can see the logic, is unbelievably shallow.

As I understand it, the reason for allowing citizens to bear arms was partly to ensure no tyranical leaders could ever subjugate the populace to terror and unduely harsh rule.  But the game's changed.  Nowadays, a tyrannical leader has a far more nuanced catalogue of weaponry, and if it ever came down to getting all dirty, there's a hell of a lot of dirtier weaponry which renders having a gun next to useless.  Better off getting a nuke if you want to fend off an undesireable government.

There's also the fear of being attacked by fellow citizens.  [StillwaterBlue](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/157ozw/hello_uk_american_here_quick_question_on_guns/c7k06b2) has already eloquently described the problem with that notion, but for arguments sake, let's say that the issue of defence actually has great weight.  

So you're carrying a gun and you're being attacked despite the attacker at least having some idea of the probablity that you do have a gun.  It would seem to me that the gun doesn't work as a deterent at all until it actually materialises.  And you know, this might have worked in your favour but for the fact that everybody has access to a gun, and so your attacker too probably has a gun and when he whips that out it's down to who has the quicker trigger finger and the truer aim.  

Of course, that's a facetious worse example (and a terrible one at that).  The (or rather a) point that I think should be considered is what do you find worse: the idea of being endangered by some troublesome thug, or the idea of some troubled person getting hold of a cache of weaponry and going on a very bad rampage?

The gun: the great leveller, but only because it renders everyone horizontal.

In my op: 

* an attack on your person, best defence is being aware and being able to run.

* an attack on your home, ensure it's as impenetrable as you can get it and call the police",0,1356096249,null,0,false,0,c7k3b2w,t3_157ozw,t1_c7k3b2w,t3_157ozw,null,1430735468,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

There's a pound shop down the road from me that does a lot of obscure drinks. Last time I was in I bought a ""Jamacian Irish Moss"" and something called a ""Yella Slow Motion Potion"".

Slow motion potion seemed to be some kind of relaxation drink, knocked me out within 20 minutes so I might substitute that for sleeping pills. Tasty stuff as well. I like it! Stronger than Bob Marley's Mellow Mood.

That's it. The Daily Mail provides a quality product for their *target audience*.

EVERY newspaper will have an article on the Royals or some movie starlet, they just get varying amounts of front page space.

I'd assume that most people who read Reddit are able to tell fact from fiction and get something useful out of the Daily Mail.

I'll also challenge people who say that the Daily Mail tells lies to provide proof that a fact is incorrect. Most of the time it's simply the *opinion* they don't like, the facts usually check out.

Uh, individual factors are definitely used in working out premiums. Does the applicant have a history of bad driving/speeding/fines? Does the applicant have a history of being involved in accidents? etc.

If you're talking about 'stores for musicians' then there's PMT (Profession Music Technology) for all your higher-end electronic stuff, and The Music Box is great for little things like strings, picks, leads etc.

Expensive but great food).

4) Check out the local music scene! There are some great bands that play around Oxford regularly. Also, if you are facebook inclined, check out [this page](https://www.facebook.com/oxfordtalks) for regular updates on interesting talks that happen around the city!

The reason this exploded beyond proportion is because of unionist parties shit stirring with them leaflets and claiming that Alliance was taking SF/SDLP's side on the issue, all to claim back Peters seat.

To provide a response. 

Japans 'lost decade' was due to a combination of circumstances absent from the Chinese development pattern.

Might I also add to consider other nations which followed similar development patterns such as Taiwan or South Korea and have largely been very successful. 

Japan has been facing what is known as deflation, or falling of asset prices. In particular, residential asset prices. 

Now that said, in China, property is not owned, its leased from the government for 75 years. The government sets the price of land to control speculation. Japan does not do this. Therefore, controlling the supply of housing is largely in government hands because they are price fixing. 

Not to say that China has a major bubble in real estate and manufacturing over capacity, but do you know what the fundemental difference is?

The difference is that the financial sector of China accounts for only maybe 15-20% of capital formation. If anything, the markets are undervalued because of a lack of regulatory framework and corrupt accounting practices, leading to excess volatility. 

In addition, due to the restrictions on outward flow of capital, the ability for Chinese to invest overseas is limited to whatever investments exist within their own domestic market. 

Open the capitial markets of China, and consider what the outward flow of investment would look like. 

Now consider if the western european and US economies were set to receive this capital in the form of infrastructure and heavy industrial investment? WOW is all i would have to say. However, it is up to our governments to ensure that the ponzi scheme we have now doesn't  spoil this opportunity. 

So to say that China wont have a bust period is indeed a bit inaccurate more than a slow economic structural adjustment to changing international conditions over a long period of time. 

However, to say that their development framework is vastly superior to the west couldn't be more accurate. 

In addition to my own research, Ive been living in china for over 6 years and have studied international economics quite extensively. I am living int his environment and have travelled all over China. Practically every major city.

There is a mechanism in the Assembly which guards against this sort of thing by requiring a cross-community majority to an issue designated by a petition of concern. This is clearly an issue which requires cross-community support.

I agree with Alliance's motives, that Belfast is a divided city and something must be done to fight segregation, but forcing the motion through isn't the way to deal with this.

What weaintgotnohistory analysis omits, is Torres' performance, his play making and the chances he is creating.

true,WDC312,lfc68,,"Hey, and welcome aboard!  Liverpool are a fantastic club to support, though you'll probably want to purchase some health insurance that has good coverage for heart attacks, as you'll be suffering more than a few of those watching our games.

Oh right, you said you're Canadian, so you've got good health insurance.  All right then!  On to the reds!

The first thing you need to know about us is probably the [2005 Champions' League Final](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPEmC3vN-bQ).  Generally considered to be the best final in the history of the competition, and one of the greatest sports comebacks ever, this is the defining moment for the club's post-2000 history.  It is epic.

The comeback was due in no small part to [Dietmar Hamann](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFRozZWihls), a German midfielder who has since left the club but will always be remembered fondly, and [Steven Gerrard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8V4zvRIpwY).

Stevie G is currently our captain, and has played for Liverpool since age 8.  He is an absolute legend, one of the best footballers of his generation, though he hasn't been at his prime for a couple of years now.  This man, more than any other player the club has right now, *is* Liverpool.  His loyalty and his incredible talent, along with a never-say-die, put-the-team-on-my-back attitude, has made him an icon to fans the world over.

Also important in the club's modern history is the [2006 FA Cup Final](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsApNfJ06eI), another Stevie G-inspired comeback, and, more recently, the 2012 Carling Cup Final, which Liverpool won in a [penalty shootout](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xY2UTVVfHo).

The club's anthem is [You'll Never Walk Alone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ma3Nax8yyOE), which, when [sung by fans before the game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftbIzKrCMZI) is incredibly moving and powerful.

Liverpool has a [longstanding rivalry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.%E2%80%93Manchester_United_F.C._rivalry) with your co-worker's Manchester United, the most heated rivalry in England.  Long story short, the Mancs are a bunch of evil bastards led by their Satanic Overlord Fergie who win too much too often with too much extra time.  I kid, but not really.

If you're serious about following the club, you'll also want to learn about the [Hillsborough disaster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster).  One of the darkest times in the club's history, the incident was further marred by horrible police work, which, along with reporting from the Sun (a newspaper), sought to blame the victims for the disaster.

Less important to Liverpool, but still an important historical event in the club's (and in English soccer's) history, is the [Heysel Stadium disaster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heysel_Stadium_disaster).

And I never said to say that with EVERY transfer. You're making it sound like I'm arguing that we need to overpay for every player. Nope. Just world-class players we're obviously fortunate to have the opportunity to sign. Like Lloris. Or Moutinho. Such opportunities are rare enough that we can afford to plump a little.

I'll be completely frank, I cannot  fathom the idea that people think there was nothing wrong with Levy's handling of the Moutinho situation. The idea of starting such vital negotiations so late that they can be undone by delays of mere hours is so obviously unreasonable. We had an entire summer in which to haggle with Porto if he wanted to save money. You think this joint-ownership issue wouldn't have emerged sooner if he'd done so?

true,philthehumanist,null,null,"&gt;Are you saying that people who earn 65k+ are doing whatever they are doing for the wrong reasons?

No - not at all. I'm saying that in those places £65k is a high wage when you have the ability to attract further wages from external companies to top it up to 100 or even 200k as MANY ALREADY DO. 

Anyone who lives in Derby who is on £65k and up will soon start to feel the pull of London and this is why the major cities pull all the talent AWAY from the smaller areas. Things are already bad as they are.

Stay as an MP for 4 years in any given area on 200k a year and you have the potential to become a millionaire. This puts you in the high-upper / very rich class and removes you from any sense of normality. I know the ""price of milk"" argument is flawed, but many MP's simply don't know what life on minimum wage, incapacity benefit or low income is like.

If you were to just turn around and pay MP's £1million a year it would NOT attract the most appropriate people.

Someone says to you that they have ""sympathy with the traveller lifestyle"" and that there needs to be tax, land and employment reform to accommodate the lifestyle more so they needn't feel as alienated, and you accuse them of talking of *""little half-breeds""*?!  Let alone that I'd laboured the point that ethnically they're indiscernible, virtual Neos walking through the crowd, that other than culture and lifestyle there's nothing to distinguish them from any number of other Europeans.

Nobody here has even remotely said anything approaching 'half-breed', that's come straight out of your mouth.  The vitriol spilled over from your keyboard.  Shame on you.

And somehow, *some-how*, you are trying to level the allegation that education and eloquence is a negative thing.  I find that bizarre.

Rather than *'bones through noses to ward off bullets'* try reading the article, for starters.  It is not a spurious argument to identify a culture clash and failure to integrate.  Social services themselves identify that the reason why a higher ratio of Romany children are taken into care is that they fail to understand the different system they have moved into; that authorities will tap on the door if your child is regularly missing school, that if you wish to take your child out of school you have to keep the authorities informed, that parents or legal guardians are legally responsible for children and so children are not allowed to beg on the streets - and also that if they don't go off the grid and they do keep in touch with the authorities there are integration funds 
already in place that if only they worked with the culture and society  they were in, whilst still being true to themselves, they very much so could become the recipients of funds hitherto going unclaimed.  

That when on this occasion  they actually met with the authorities in a town hall to discuss the ongoing matter they left reassured once they knew that in this society local government and services do run checks and do want to be, need to be, at least a little involved.  That there needs to be a cultural compromise between the two groups.  You only have to see interviews and documentaries with travellers themselves, life C4s 'Gypsy Blood' to appreciate that they themselves identify that poor education and different emphases early on in life are leading to seclusion and fracture later on in life, and that they themselves recognise reform has to happen.  The problem you have is that it's not just media or self-attested traveller and Romany testimony, and that the 'white supremacist educated Europeans', as you'd have it framed, are making disassociated observations.  It's that virtually everybody has several of their own personal anecdotes of how they themselves have observed or experienced the two cultures clash and fail to integrate - something that both sides willingly acknowledge as being a problem.   

Heaven forbid somebody should try to suggest a coming together only for somebody like you to try and drive the wedge a little further and send the two sides back to their corners to come out fighting again by deliberately talking in terms of race.  You just don't want to tackle that there is a very real and obvious culture clash, but rather to reduce it down to 'half-breeds', which is, quite frankly, an absolute affront to the actually discussion when you're the first person to bring up such things.

If I were Romany, or a traveller, and you were my advocate, I don't think you could have played it worse to put the status of the problem in a less constructive or persuasive light.  You've not come  presenting genuine and appreciable grievances, but with a log cabin sized chip on your shoulder to reinvent the argument and to reframe it along dishonest lines.

My eloquence must be failing me in my summation for in the face of such petulance I can only repeat myself:

if this were a rational debate, I would point out that op is about an anti Jewish riot that occurred in London AFTER the shoah. It could still happen now.

I shouldn't even have to say this, but not all Jews are zionists. And it is possible to be a Zionist and disagree with the reprehensible actions of the Israeli govt.

So you should only be paid for one job, even if you work two, if the total amount is over 100 or 200k!? Punishing success? 

&gt;This puts you in the high-upper / very rich class and removes you from any sense of normality.

This logic would then exclude the people at the very bottom from being able to keep a grip on normality and you would have to come to some abject mean figure based on which pay bracket you, tom, dick or harry decides is normal?

Here'S an idea for you. People on benefits today can be millionaires tomorrow and vice versa. Having money doesn't mean you lose touch with normal life, unless you are a twat, and in that case you would have likely been a twat when / if you were poor too. 

&gt;If you were to just turn around and pay MP's £1million a year it would NOT attract the most appropriate people.

In a meritocracy, which I think would be the best kind of government, paying a high salary to a politician would be more necessary because rather than having overqualified students who have never really had jobs with massive responsibility, you would have leading heads in the given departments. At the moment you have 60k salary and 15 twats from the same school in the front bench of the government. Can it get any less normal than that? Can it get any more out of touch?

true,T0P_CAT,null,null,"Earlier this year two police officers were killed in the UK and some of the press the next day started saying we should arm police officers. The main voice against being permanently armed were the police themselves. If they're carrying weapons then criminals know that they need to start carrying them too. It makes policing into a war. 

My parents used to shoot clay pigeons and when I was much younger, I didn't mind it then but for a few years now I've been harbouring a deep seated hatred of guns. I think they're gross and they're design is disgusting - they're central aim is to kill - how a society can feel safer having that around, I have no idea. 

You guys should have extreme gun control laws and if the NRA and their supporters refuse to acknowledge how damaging their views on gun control are then screw them, supersede them and just concentrate on ammunition; make it impossible to load the things. People want to feel big and maintain their constitutional rights, fine, have a gun, but make it empty.

As for the NRA's argument - if all of those teachers were armed children would still have to die for the rest of them to be protected. And what happens when one of the NRA's mythical defenders ends up shooting an innocent person they're trying to protect? And the fact that they want more armed people in schools strikes me as a disgusting way of making profit from required armed officers that they want to put in place in schools. I don't know if I can express to you how offensive people would find it here if you had armed officers in schools - not just offensive - repulsive. 

Also - you live in a country with the most technologically advanced military in the world - if you're government gets taken over by a dictator no militia you can put together with a bunch of magnums and rifles will stand a chance. And more importantly - thats just not going to happen. 

Trust one another enough to not need to hold a gun to one others heads - you will feel safer. The days of the frontier are over. You're doing fine. You just don't need those things anymore. The more trust you put in one another the less of you will get killed by guns. ",0,1356124115,null,0,1356124746,0,c7ka9f4,t3_157ozw,t1_c7ka9f4,t3_157ozw,null,1430738824,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

For many anti-Islamists, it's really a proxy for not liking ""Pakis"" or ""Arabs"".  Add to that that, specifically with hardcore communities, leaving is a frankly fucking terrifying option, and behaving like this makes both the conservatism of the communities stronger and the prospect of leaving harder (since much of the abuse will continue, but now you'll be abused by both sides).

For the majority of Muslims whose religion is little more relevant than the majority of Christians, I couldn't care a toss about it.  I don't do religion, but you do your thing and enjoy.  For those stuck in the ridiculously authoritarian and conservative communities, I prefer to treat them like I do a large percentage of fascists.  Many don't want that life, it's just an all-consuming worldview with a a community who will reject you the instant you don't seem an enthusiast.

Shelvey - 20 y.o. Midfielder

Suso - 19 y.o. Attacking Midfielder

Assaidi - Injured

Boroini - Injured

Sterling - 17 y.o. Needs rest

Pacheco - 21 y.o. 

Enrique - Left Back

Downing - Not had a great time at Liverpool. May be leaving soon.

Cole - Not had a great time at Liverpool. May be leaving soon.

I went for Shelvey and Cole, but realistically we're relying on playing young/inexperienced players, players out of position or guys who just don't look like cutting it at Liverpool. None of these options are ideal. It's pretty obvious this is the area of our squad that needs strenghtening. 

Perhaps Suso for Cole on reflection?

Have I missed anyone out?

Secondly it plays that old fallacy that foreign keepers can't deal with high-crosses in to the box and tend to not like the physical nature of a side like Stoke.  As if these were somehow uniquely British traits, rather than the fundamental cornerstones of the game, which Lloris rightly points out.  It's pandering and pathetic to even write otherwise.

true,Undoer,null,null,"I'm gonna split pro-gun people into 2 categories, the ""We need them to defend ourselves"" and the ""I like shooting at targets and/or going hunting"". To the people who suggest guns are a necessity to defend yourself, I'd say they're not. If you cannot get a gun, how can a thief, burglar, rapist, murderer, or drug-addled lunatic? They can't. It's worth noting though, that a valid reason to apply for a Gun License (and thus own a gun as permitted by the license) is to protect your property, so it's not worth mentioning that a gun is needed to defend yourself (which it isn't, I've never owned a gun capable of doing more than bruising someone (air rifle)) and I'm perfectly safe. 

As to the ""I like shooting and/or going hunting"" crowd I have a completely different answer, as I consider them to be less moronic, and more deserving of an actual answer. I'd tell them that there's plenty of shooting clubs across the UK (though I've no idea about hunting) and that being part of one supports an application for a gun license, and any gun they would desire for such a hobby (Assuming they don't hunt with a Gatling Gun)  is can be applied for on a gun license. Basically, the hobby of shooting is in no danger in the UK, I know several people of whom guns are a part of their hobby. 

As it is I feel our gun laws are perfectly balanced between unsafe and too safe (too safe being nobody has a gun and everyone is paranoid about knife crimes instead or something stupid). Automatic weapons are completely banned, and you can't carry fire arms in public, so mass shootings would be pretty hard to do if you were to obtain the gun through legal channels, and through illegal channels it would be incredibly expensive. 

Obviously people do get killed by guns, that's a fact of life, but I'd like to think that the gun laws in this country minimize the risk of gun crime becoming a real issue. ",0,1356130221,null,0,false,0,c7kbub2,t3_157ozw,t1_c7kbub2,t3_157ozw,null,1430739557,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

If I disagree with something, I have many avenues to show and express my disagreement, and one of them is through symbolic act. Burning books is my opinion silly, because the reason behind it was to remove information which obviously is no longer a huge concern for the Qu'ran, but if someone wishes to show that they disagree with the content than they can burn the book to express it. This man however merely ripped a page, a much less serious assault. 

However, if this were done to a Bible the outcry would be much less severe. We have an annoying situation where criticism or hostility towards the teachings of the Islamic faith, and Muslim practices, is seen as equivalent to racism and xenophobia. I personally disagree with Islam, I believe many of its tennants are vile and it has no place in our modern society. However, expressing views of any similarity to that in person can often lead to quite damaging claims being made against you. I'd also add that I would never act in a way that would show hostility or hatred towards a person just because of their faith.

Its just the convenience of driving whenever you want and not having to wait for buses or trains in the freezing wet weather. 

If you still want to drive, you can cut down your insurance by doing a couple things though. I found that the [moneysupermarket](http://www.moneysupermarket.com/car-insurance/teenagers/) website was quite useful for a start. 

First of all, I wish I had taken my test when I was 18 even if I knew i wasn't gona use it, it would have been cheaper for me now

What I'm doing now is just being a named driver, which means I am not the main policy holder and not getting any no claims bonus. For me to be the main policy holder on my car would have been £2k this year, for being a named driver with my brother as main, it was £750 for BOTH of us. No claims bonus roughly equals to save 10% a year on your next insurance, but is it really worth it? It wasn't for me, but its something you will have to work out yourself.

true,CopreaVonDedd,null,null,"You won't need to know this until season 6 and season 7, but it's a very big reference in both episodes, and fans without knowledge of the classic series tend to get a little confused.

In Classic Who, there was a very major character named Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart, who used to be the head of UNIT, which you'll learn about just by watching the show. He's the longest running character in Doctor who (aside from the Doctor himself, but he's played by multiple actors, while the brigadier was always the same man). The brigadier was introduced during the Second Doctor's tenure in 1968, and remained a recurring character on the show all the way up until its cancellation in 1989. He and the Doctor were great friends, and they worked together many times when the Doctor came to Earth.

Sadly, Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart does not appear at any point in New Who, but in the last episode of season six and fourth episode of season seven, you will need to know who he is. The new series has been very good about giving the viewer all the information they need so they don't have to watch the older episodes, but for some reason, they don't explain the brigadier at all. He gets a very brief mention in season 4 when the Doctor is working with UNIT, but it's very fleeting and easily forgettable and not enough for anyone who doesn't know who he is to pick up on.

When my sister and brother-in-law were watching the finale of season six, my sister didn't have a clue who they were referring to, and we had to explain it to her. Then we had to explain it again when he got another reference in season seven.

**TL;DR:** There's a classic character named Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart who gets a couple of references in seasons 6 and 7, but they don't explain who he is.

The burden of proof remains on the prosecution, i.e. they must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the illegal act, or the actus reus in legalese.

The prosecution must present evidence to this effect.

Strict liability refers not to the act, but to the mental element of the crime, the mens rea. Essentially it means that it doesn't matter whether you intentionally, recklessly, negligently, or completely innocently committed the offence. You're still guilty.

&gt;causing religiously aggravated intentional harassment, alarm or distress, by demonstrating hostility based on membership of a particular religious group, Islam.

If it hadn't stated that in the charge then you'd be correct in saying it is subjective but because this is against a specific group it is not subjective. It is LEGALLY objective but philosophically subjective.

On a wider scale yes it is subjective but were not talking on a wider scale, it doesn't say it's offensive to everyone just Muslims so in regards to the law no it is not subjective, hence the court case. 

Edit: I'm in full agreement with you, there's a well quoted comedian Steve Hughes that has a great line about being offended and why it doesn't make sense.

true,hunty91,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"That part is definitely correct, sorry, I wasn't very clear about that.

What I mean is that the concept of ""strict liability"" does not shift the burden of proof from the prosecution (P) to the defendant (D). It refers only to the mental element of the crime, i.e. it doesn't matter if you were negligent or the post office lost your cheque.

Now, the law itself as it stands is outlined in section 143 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. Under 143(2) the Act defines the crime as one of strict liability (since the wording mentions no particular mental state of intention/recklessness/negligence etc required).

Section 143(3) outlines a series of instances in which D may 'prove' a set of circumstances existed *as a defence.* Note that this is not the same as the burden of proof shifting off P. They must *first* prove that D committed the guilty act *as a matter of fact.*

143(3)(c) is interesting, as it allows D to use a defense of ""I didn't know, nor did I have any reason to believe, that I was not insured."" This seems to let D get away with the 'ignorance' excuse.
However, at this stage (i.e. when it comes to a defense *in law*), the burden of proof is on D to prove the defense. This particular defense has two elements: a) D did not know he was uninsured on the vehicle, *AND* b) D had no reason to believe he was uninsured on the vehicle.
This is fairly tricky to prove. P simply asking ""Have you ever had official confirmation that you are insured to drive the car?"" would seem to dispel any reasonable explanation except in the most exceptional of circumstances.

You will need a degree for starters look into what you actually want to do and what these degree courses contain, biochemistry degrees are very different depending on the department and research that is done on campus, also look into the availability of lab based research projects in the third year.

One good option for you would be a degree in biological sciences whatever that maybe, then join the NHS graduate program, this trains you to be a clinical microbiologist, haematologist and other specialist subjects, it takes 2 years but you get paid 25k and get an MSc.

Both teams have relatively large fanbases, and many of their supporters pay for what's called a ""season ticket"" which gets them access to every home game for the year - which they attend regularly. 

I wouldn't say football as a whole is a massive part of our culture, you can quite easily avoid the sport - especially if you don't live near the stadiums. That's not to say it isn't popular though!

The sad thing is that Scottish football seems to be having huge financial problems - Glasgow Rangers (one of the most popular teams) just went bankrupt, and Hearts are facing similar prospects.

""Nuclear weapons should be used when necessary."" I would say you need to define ""necessary"", except that doesn't even begin to cover any kind of context, necessary as a first strike option? a retaliatory option? nuclear threat elimination? non-nuclear threat elimination? IE: North Korea has enough artillery pointed at the south to decimate Seoul, to be completely honest, if it came down to it, a low yield tactical nuclear strike would be a good way of  eliminating that threat... But I don't believe for a single moment that would be a good idea or that us or anyone else should actually do it. On the flip side; having a retaliatory option dissuades someone else's first strike option.

On the question of the second world war, I think it's better to ask that with no contextual information before the question, and include a preceding question that can be used to judge the answering persons knowledge of the political situation of the time. About half the people your questioning are going to be unaware that the Japanese were attempting to surrender at the time and that there was a strong incentive towards dropping the bomb for geopolitical reasons. Another but not necessary opposite portion are only going to read the numbers of dead and disagree, and yet another portion are going to see the historical context and conclude that if no-one ever dropped the bomb in anger and produced the horrors that followed then the Cuban missile crisis could very likely have ignited the spark that killed us all.

&gt;The UK needs a weapon (not necessarily nuclear) 

That is just awfully AWEFULLY ambiguous. There isn't a single non-nuclear weapon that comes anywhere near SSBNs or ICBMs or (mostly obsolete) Nuclear bombers when it comes to deterring a nuclear power from a nuclear attack. Even the USA's fleets of aircraft carriers would not be a deterrent to a nuclear power if it were not one itself.

 &gt; If there were no nuclear weapons, the world would be a better place.

Can't answer without context. If the laws of physics prevented nuclear cascade reactions... sure. If we scraped every nuclear weapon on earth, someone somewhere would build a new one from scratch, some country's would lie and keep a few stockpiled. it's actually a completely irrelevant question because it's really not possible in our current geopolitical situation.",0,1356151626,null,0,false,0,c7kgmyj,t3_158rb8,t1_c7kgmyj,t3_158rb8,null,1430741905,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I find it unthinkable that we'd cut bait on Gylfi after half a season. If anything he deserves more play time. 

I've only watched 3-4 games of Belhanda in the CL this year (I don't follow Ligue 1) and I see a player who is very gifted but raw and a bit frustrating. He likes to take people on and is a good goalscorer, but I don't see enough penetration or creativity with his passing to make me excited. He's an excellent dribbler but can have Andros Townsend syndrome at times, running into trouble and getting dispossessed. 

I just don't think he's the type of player we should be looking at. Eriksen is often talked about as a #10 but really he's more of a #8 and plays in a 4-3-3 so I think he'd be a far better option (though I severely doubt he will leave in January). Of course what we REALLY need is a #6 and Belhanda certainly is not that.
