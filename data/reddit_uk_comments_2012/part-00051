true,severedfragile,lfc68,,"So many players to speculate on.... I think our most important appointment might be director of football. I'd love Rafa to return in that capacity, I think that with a bit of money, he'd make some very good additions.

Of your list, I think Strootman and Giroud would be excellent (I saw an article talking about us poaching Giroud for cheap earlier today, he looks like a player who could trouble the net more than the woodwork). They'd both add quality while possibly solving two major problems we have. Kagawa's never going to happen, though. 

At the moment, Rasmus Elm and Jackson Martinez are the players we seem to be linked to most. I don't know that much about either, but from what little I do know, they seem like they'd add to positions we're a little weak in. Gaston Ramirez would be an excellent addition on the wing, there's been speculation linking us to him as well. Victor Moses is out of contract and could be a good addition to the squad. Faling that, I think Junior Hoillet could bring some serious pace and crossing on the cheap - they aren't CL options, but we're not currently a CL club and we have to look at players who can do well at our level and potentially develop into excellent players as we work to grow back into an excellent team.

Aquilani returning would be excellent, I've already expressed my thoughts on the thread about him. Should he not return, I'd like Gylfi to stay at Swansea but he'd be a great addition to our squad if he does have to leave them - if he can't become a Swansea player, I'd much rather we have him than any of our rivals in the league. 

And while I hesitate to draw up a wishlist, I've been interested in André Schürrle (Leverkusen) for a while now. Can't say I've seen anything to even suggest he might be an option, but he fits everything we're looking for.

We were linked with Stevan Jovetic when Rafa was around, and with Fiorentina having a pretty torrid season, it might be worth re-explroing that - tremendously creative player and I think he and Suarez would tear shit up together every week. Borja Valero is another player who'd add a lot to our central midfield, I think he's versatile enough to fit almost any role in the center. Keisuke Honda would be anothr one with experience, creativity and quality, and he looks to be leaving Russia.

I'm a big fan of Javi Martinez and Ander Herrera, but their Europa league campaign means they'll probably have even more suitors than before, probably pushing us out of the picture. 

Does anyone know much about Nacional? Considering we're developing a relationship with them, it's worth taking a close look at some of their promising players.

Probably a dozen more I just can't remember right now. Hard to speculate when we don't know who's going to be leaving/staying/returning and how much money's available, which is why I think DoF is the main concern at the moment.

I get invited to weekly tastings of his new brews with a small group of like-minded beer drinkers, and whenever I'm not working and can make it down, we all have a slow pint and fill out a tasting form, then get shitfaced on the remainder of the container - there's normally a good ten pints for each drinker there.

Now THAT'S a cheap way to drink! 

It helps that we do tastings in the gigantic basement that he and our friends fitted out and live in, that includes a 12 seat home cinema, a small recording studio (which I helped build), and a full carpentry workshop, as well as a nightclub sound system and lighting in storage that sometimes gets set up if people ask for it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"IBM, Sun, Oracle, Microsoft and Apple have moved the industry forward to where we are today.

This is how I view open source software:
pick an app store on any phone, you will find one genuinely innovative piece software that moves things forward and works a treat. 

Then you will find a million copies that aren't quite as good but give you the same sort of functionality, they are probably free this to me is how I see open source. I am a professional sysadmin.  

The open source community isn't innovating they are merely copying the ideas of others, actually leeching of genuine innovators,  and sure it works fine some of the time, most of the time if you make the right choice out the tens of thousands of different untested, probably buggy, probably insecure  combinations. 

Or you can go to someone like hp or apple or microsoft or ibm and know you are dealing with a complete idea properly well thought out by proper computing geniuses,  that has been tested properly, works reliably and consistently and has 24 hour support and you are two phone calls away  to people who can change the code and have can issue bugfixes. 

The likes of Microsoft, Apple, HP employ the finest minds in the industry, you are not relying on posting on newsgroups with bedroom hackers offering advice. 

The open source community are specifically trying to shut out propietary vendors from getting a look in here, and that quite frankly is bollocks , mantra, some wierdy beardy bedroom programmers wet dream stoner fantasy come true.  It worked for Munich it can work everywhere, open source is the only solution, we must force it in.

The real world is full of a heterogeneous mix of different software, hardware systems and applications that interconnect and run various things from customer services to factories to bank transactions (atms) to life support systems to traffic lights to salary payments.

If you are stuck in a strange town in the middle of nowhere in a foreign country and you cant get access to your money because the cashpoint is down I'm sure 

""I'm Sorry sir, we've made a newsgroup posting and are waiting for one of the developers to reply, we cant exactly be sure when it will be but I hope you arent too actually bothered like""

Real sysadmins deal with systems that can be dull and simple or the difference between life and death, so this fucking open-source mantra, this political-religious-obsession that these people have, with their copied not quite as good as the original, BUT IT WORKS, I'm just not buying it, because in the real world, real sysadmins have to work with a plethora of real systems from many vendors, and for some of those systems you absolutely need innovative proprietary software vendors who employ the industries brightest and proper round the clock access to the the people who wrote the software, not a bunch of amateur hackers. 

Open Source Im fine with it has its place in the world of IT, there is loads of it about, but take over, no,  and for so many reasons too. 

As a user you may just like to know that there is no perfect hardware, software or systems combination, everything you implement must be carefully, designed, developed, integrated and tested, if you want it to be reliable it costs, and it costs a lot of money from reliable disk systems (that incorporate redundancy) that may have their data mirrored to multiple sites over multiple paths they will be connected to  uninterruptable power supplies connected to different electricity suppliers from different towns, they may incorporate the most expensive hard disks running redundantly and data being mirrored to multiple locations across the world it may incorporate entirely redundant clustered computing systems working in tandem across multiple sites in multiple locations around the world,sitting in front of these massively complex and expensive state of the art storage area networks with the fastest disks available and the fastest interconnects.  

As a user you might like to know that as a sysadmin I would far prefer to be dealing with a known reliable and tested software combination that sits a top of all with a contract that gets me guaranteed 24 hours a day access to Microsoft or HP's or IBM's actual software developers. The best and the brightest in the industry. I actually want to deal with people who have seen it all, and who I know work on life impacting systems day in, day out, people who work with hospital, and banks, and 24 hour non-stop factories and the finance industry (not my favourites but downtime to them costs many millions of pounds a minute). If I'm in a hospital I do not want to be working with a bunch of kids working on a system they learnt at school, which does an ok kind of job, but they have no idea of the software sitting on top of that, and they dont know who to call and they'll put a ticket in and if I'll call back in one hour because that's the SLA lol. 
I would prefer a properly thought out, designed, tested and integrated software solution with round the clock support by professionals, software experts, the designers, the innovators, the developers, the actual brains behind the software.  

If you buy professional support contracts you can have Microsoft Windows code changed overnight, bugfixes written and tested within hours, by the people who wrote the software understand the full implications of doing so, I'm sure you can get the same with Red-Hat, but with a closed source proprietary platform you know software has been properly designed and developed and tested together, and that the the developers sit next door to each other and you aren't dealing with a plethora of different vendors and amateur hacks who just meet up and smoke herb and party at open source camp fire gatherings once or twice a year but all work independently the rest of the year because they are off busy developing their own applications.

Many of the open source arguments simply dont cut it to me as a real sysadmin. Much of the software doesn't either by the way. Frankly most of it is a half-assed copy of genuine innovations, the community leeches off the genuine innovators in the IT industry, then they say its kinda good enough, there can be only one. 

Errr....not quite as it goes. The world just doesn't work like that, you would be asking people with budgets, managers responsible for other real jobs, in mid-wales to rewrite systems that are essential to the running of a local authority, salaries, supplier payments, traffic light systems interfaces with a million different vendors who run a million different types of other system from state of the art to archaic, to the lollipop lady who needs to collect her money from the office in cash because she doesnt trust banks, all sorts of lovely strange weird crap.  

When open source software is innovative enough and it is compelling enough (and that means genuinely easy to use by real people, not geeks who know *nix and l33t) I am sure it will take the world by storm, until then it shouldn't try to force its way in, because it still isn't good enough it tries to copy and sometimes it does a great job, sometimes not so good, most of it certainly isn't mature enough yet and is chock full of security vulnerabilities, it is far from being a complete solution for every organisation in the world, and the very idea of layers of untested combinations of different bits of software fill me with dread, If you actually look to see what Microsoft is fighting for here it is the open source community trying to be the only choice.  That is infantile, it isn't good enough yet, it isn't mature enough, and the issues of integration and untested software combinations from different software vendors in real life are a real concern for the industry and should be for you as a user, the whole world cannot run on open source software yet. It would be a great risk to even try it, you cannot replicate the munich experience to the whole world that is simply nonsense, its a pipedream and pipedreams  have no place when it comes running IT systems in real life.

&gt;Many turn to the internet to seek the comfort and guidance that they cannot find in their daily lives, but, although we must recognise the internet as an important resource in today’s society, we must be mindful of the fact that there are websites and chatrooms which encourage the vulnerable, the lonely and the depressed to consider taking their own lives.

&gt;Many young people talk about **“catching the bus”** when they refer to seeking information on the internet about suicide. Organisations such as PIPS believe that, when certain terms are used to access information on suicide or self-harm, a “pop-up” should appear, informing the individual of the help and support that is available. **A gatekeeper or guardian should be in place to monitor websites, and they should have the power to forward information to the appropriate authority with a view to having the website closed down.** A complaints procedure should also be in place. I feel that as young people today are becoming more insular and relying more on computers to interact socially, that would make a significant contribution to lowering the levels of suicide and of self-harm which are sadly prevalent in today’s society.

So...you post on facebook about needing to catch the bus to work, a pop-up appears telling you to call the suicide hotline, the police appear at your flat and facebook is shut down.

true,Philomathematic,hartnell,Hartnell,"As a few others have pointed out, the tenure of 8 depends on how you view the audio dramas, novels, and other media outside of the official BBC television series. And the TV movie *was* intended to be the pilot of a NewWho in its own right, but ended up failing instead. So it's not as though it was intended that 8 would only ever get screentime in the movie. That's why they provide you with a ridiculous amount of unnecessary information right at the beginning, for instance.

As for 9, I think that what happened with him was, in the end, just right. It's a pity that the quality of his stories varied so wildly, as he definitely was capable of doing *The Empty Child* or *Dalek*-quality work for the whole series... but Series 1 did exactly what it was supposed to, in my opinion: it got the show re-established, re-introduced all of the major plot points to Doctor Who, and gave the Doctor an excellent character arc. By the end of Series 1, he is in the same position as the end of the Time War - destroy everything, or die. And he finds peace in being able to not be the destroyer. Regenerating, for him, is a fresh start. And again, as far as Series 1 being an introduction to Doctor Who for many people, the concept of regeneration is the last major piece of the puzzle.

Because can you imagine if Eccleston would have gone on to do a few more series? It would have been good and he would have continued to be fantastic, I am sure. But when he decided to move on, it would have been necessary to re-introduce regeneration that late into the game. Sure, it's been done before (see: *The Tenth Planet*, i.e. the first time the Doctor regenerated), but putting the regeneration at the end of Series 1 rather than putting it off gives the series and 9 a nice closure.

So in the end, I think this is a question of poor planning and story-arcing, in the case of the 8th, and good planning and story-arcing, in the case of the 9th.",0,1335843065,null,0,false,0,c4ilpct,t3_t0mgo,t1_c4ilpct,t3_t0mgo,null,1428831024,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

Look at Rafa's expensive signings. Keane, we've talked about. Aquilani played well when he was fit and has been wasted since then, but still featured for AC Milan and Juventus. Glen Johnson makes too many mistakes sometimes, but he was also part of the best defence in the league for the first half of the season, before injury (and was bought partially because Portsmouth couldn't pay the money they owed for Crouch). Who else did he pay over £10m for? Torres, Alonso, Kuyt, Mascherano. Aside from Jovetic, he also tried to get Barry (one of City's unsung heroes this season) and Dani Alves, who he was roundly mocked for even looking at.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Where are all these technologies that are cheaper than linux?

Operating systems run applications that do important stuff, applications that may have been running for many years and are 
perfectly efficient at what they do having been designed, developed and tested and implemented over many years that are understood by the people that use them. Things that work perfectly fine, that do  all kinds of important stuff and non-important stuff. That run on a variety of platforms for a good reason, because they are the best platforms to run them on. 

Thats the reality, to try to force linux and open source software in to replace-it-all is a nonsense. An operating system is one component of a million of other highly integrated systems. Operating systems aren't terribly expensive compared to everything else that sits around and integrates with them. 

The reason companies like to go with as homogenous a solution as is possible is simply the practicality, you are dealing with one vendor  and a single vertical architecture. 

Sure linux is free, but if you want a professional suppport service it costs, so you dont deploy zoobuntoo you deploy red hat.

Sysadmins need 24 hour round the clock support by experts who know the experts on the database team or the the experts on the email server team, where you arent having to deal with different companies when critical systems stop working. 

&gt;China, India and Brazil are developing world countries and have invested in linux because of its low costs. Ever read about the frustration of microsoft trying to get Chinese companies to pay for their relatively expensive software?

This is Britain and Europe we are talking about and the real world with real IT systems that do a plethora of life impacting functions, that run on software stacks that have been proven over many years that are known and understood by the users. 

It's simply ridiculous to suggest everyone has to replace everything with open source because its free. 

&gt;One of the advantages of linux is its ability to run well on old and cheap hardware. As security support for old microsoft software dies, linux looks like an ever more attractive option.

Not in my datacentre, we discount hardware properly and get rid of it when its out of date because it becomes a maintenance headache  and increasingly costly to maintain as spares become harder to source as manufacturers end of life them. What kind of world do you live in? I dont know what kind of outdated crap you have running you organisations, not actually a compelling argument in the real world.

&gt;Linux does not need license management. You can use linux on a million computers without paying anyone anything in license costs.

And in organisations that have to do real things in the real world you need software support agreements that include people from  paying  thousands of suppliers and  integrating with other systems that arent open source and work in weird and wonderful ways to paying the little lollipop lady in cash from the office because she doesnt have a bank account but everybody loves her because shes the best lollipop lady in the world.

&gt;Can you really claim that windows 7 is mature and well integrated? By the time a company is running in it, windows 8 will probably be released. Linux doesn't have this problem, you can upgrade as updates are produced without having to pay at all.

You dont pay for security updates on windows either.  Just saying like.....are you on crack....:?

In any integrated IT system you dont just install updates willy nilly, you plan them, you test them, you develop rollback plans, you test the  rollback plans, and you make sure you do things in the right order so highly integrated systems dont break. In the real world...

&gt; Linux admins can manage more hardware and software and are paid only slightly more. So, they work out being more cost effective.

TCO is probably about the same.
There really isnt a cost benefit its just simply open source mantra from people who copy other peoples ideas. If open source took over, there wouldnt be any new ideas, open source isn't innovative its like a leech off the closed source world. The open source community is too busy stealing other peoples ideas and fixing bugs to actually drive innovation. Companies like Microsoft and Apple and Oracle and HP and Cisco and Intel hire the finest brightest minds to work on their products.  These are the innovators not the guys in their bedrooms trying to be like them.  

Why change the world and systems that do real stuff just because of mantra...the reasons have to be utterly compelling and so does the software, and  there is a reason that open source systems wont take over it is integration.

Sun btw would change Java from one version to the next in such a way applications developed for the previous version stop working completely with the new version. This left applications no longer just not upgradeable, apps developed on one version couldn't use the same physical computer system as an app developed for a later version. Everything had to be redeveloped from the old version to the new.   Causing no end of chaos.

Operating systems, databases, email systems, web servers, these things are all highly connected if you change one tiny element things stop working, and the problem with getting multiple systems from multiple vendors is having multiple companies to call multiple contracts to sign multiple maintenace agreements to maintain, this is why IT departments prefer to stick with a single homogenous platform, open source isnt a platform, its a bunch of different bits of software written companies,  when you need something fixed you want one number to call and you want to deal with someone who knows the intricacies of your business because you pay for his services, these people are called Technical Account Managers, they are the interface between a software vendor and a business, they understand what you do as a business and they are someone to call if the shit hits the fan, you pay for them, they arent cheap but they are invaluable and can represent your business to a software company thats dealing with a million other businesses, as an IT department, I want as few of these as possible because it simplifies everything, simplification is the key to successful computing, complexity is a bitch, if I have an application issue I want to call Microsoft or IBM I dont want to have to call mysql and redhat and oracle and a load of suppliers. 

&gt;Linux doesn't have this problem, you can upgrade as updates are produced without having to pay at all.

There is no free ride, that my dear is a nonsense and TCO between Windows and Linux is about the same, its not compelling enough to sweep by all that has gone before it for A BRAVE NEW WORLD,just say no to crack....

&gt;  Microsoft cuts support for their software after a given time period and companies that use their software are entirely reliant on this one entity to maintain support.

For a very good reason it becomes more expensive for everyone involved to have to maintain different revisions of software. Old software becomes an increasing security risk, maintaining lots of versions of software introduces unnecessary complexity. 

You tend to know what is about to happen well in advance and plan it properly, its no different with open source systems except you now have more vendors upgrading at different schedules and a lot more integration testing that you have to do. 

And if things don't work you get the inevitable teleconferences between different back covering IT vendors, and programmers going wtf, youre not supposed to do that, that not our problem its yours, no its yours. Oh how much fun I've had on those dreary telephone calls that go on for days and weeks on end with managers threatening, developers arguing and engineers on site scratching their heads, and at the end they work out who got what wrong and fix it. Dealing with one company makes things a lot simpler, application architectures developed for a homogenous platform tend to be better integrated and tested.

&gt; This means that if a company wants to keep up with security updates it has to upgrade both its microsoft software and its hardware. This is expensive and these costs would be much lower with linux.For example, IIS7 is only available for windows vista and up.

IIS runs on Windows Server primarily. 

IIS7 was a complete functional rewrite involved the http listener being moved into  kernel mode for performance.
They decided to modify the OS in order to rewrite it, this isnt something typical

&gt;And yet most prefer the open source LAMP framework.

In the linux world yes. Important stuff, like banks tend to stick with Microsoft if they are a Microsoft shop.  

&gt; Expensive licensing.

For things like algorithms and software components, drivers, specialist things that they know that other companies have developed, but they pay properly to license and use. 

You have to ask the question if I design something and I don't offer it for free, if this is my livelihood, is it actually OK for someone else to just copy and steal my ideas? I don't think so personally. Cross licensing agreements have always happened within the industry.  There have been lots of partners that got acccess to the whole Microsoft code base, back when NT4 was written they encouraged innovation by giving the NT3.51 source code away to innovators to do innovative stuff with, which is where Citrix came from. Microsoft eventually fucked them when they tried to do the same thing on later releases, but that's neither here nor there,  it has become a very successful company. It was common for Microsoft to have other vendors develop stuff that wasn't their area of expertise.",0,1335849602,null,0,false,0,c4in1js,t3_szilf,t1_c4in1js,t1_c4ic5y3,null,1428831656,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I suspect the ramifications of that case may sound the death knell of the free software movement, and you thought Microsoft were your enemy, if Google has any sense at all it is going to settle that case because if copying other peoples apis and changing underlying functionality is found to be illegal, the repercussions are immense for the free software copying other peoples work industry. It might actually force you to innovate.

true,cypressgroove,null,null,"They'd still have to change legislation for this if they wanted it 'properly legitimate' as the smoking ban wording, going from a hazy recollection I've got from when I worked in a law firm when this came into effect, actually covered all forms of ignition that produces smoke for the purposes of inhalation or something ridiculously broad like that - I think to cover the usage of all those random 'herbal tobacco' blends you can get from headshops.

That said - if they *did* go with this, and to be honest this news was actually mentioned in the Argus 116 days ago according to the rss bookmark I made of it on my phone which fills me with hope that it's still on the table but I digress, I should imagine it would be more like that series of the wire where they had Hamsterdam - where it's still technically illegal but the police are instructed not to enforce those laws so long as certain rules are followed.

I'm not sure how I feel about that really. First when you do it that way it's going to provide an easy-in for national tabloid press dirt-raking and probably means that the second Lucas and/or the green councillors get ousted the new people will change it back. But on the other hand it would happen a damn sight quicker if they do it that way - plus, being completely selfish for a moment, but it's probably one of the few career paths that I can genuinely claim to be very qualified for... ;D

::edit:: ..and thinking about it further in the broader question of the smoking ban - can you ***imagine*** the ruckuses that are going to erupt from the west street sorts when they can't smoke their cigs inside whilst they're getting beer'd and cheap white wine'd up when just round the corner a 'bunch of worthless stoners get to smoke inside in the warm'... Strikes me that's a timebomb waiting to happen. That said if I could bring myself to have a little more faith in humanity I might imagine a world where those west streeters come in to ruck, get curious, discover the magic of trees and the whole story ends with a group hug and fade to black...

&gt;What chelsea needs is an experienced manager. For a club like Chelsea which has to compete in various leagues, put in order between various pro to rookie players, sign new talent, build and develop a team and above all that make sure the building team stays at a reasonable rank is a tough task.

His gamble paid off with Torres and Mascherano, but Kuyt can be considered a disappointment in that he was brought in on the back of his scoring record in Holland. His eventual dedication and contributions cannot change the fact that we bought him to be a goal scorer. Xabi turned out great, but he wasn't anywhere near that level at Sociedad. He was a squad player who turned out to be a superstar. Aquilani should never have been bought when he did, bringing in an injured player is just dumb, especially when he is expected to replace a legend like Xabi. 

For every success in Torres, Xabi and Reina, Rafa had duds like Crouch, Keane, Babel and Aurelio. Also, incredible sales like the Xabi one, as well as the Arbeloa one meant that both Hodgson has had to work with almost no left back.

&gt;The open source community isn't innovating they are merely copying the ideas of others, actually leeching of genuine innovators

Firstly, this is just nonsense - most of the innovative work in the webserver space is open source.  Secondly, it's also nonsense because being first to market doesn't mean being the most innovative in an established development area.  And thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, it misses the whole point that the business model has little to nothing to do with innovation - what drives innovation is perceiving a need.

&gt;proper computing geniuses

I honestly don't know what to say.  Only that I guess I prefer my computer geniuses to be improper.

&gt;you are not relying on posting on newsgroups with bedroom hackers offering advice. 

If you need handholding, there are excellent service contracts available for many of the more heavyweight open source projects, often with staff with significantly more detailed knowledge, higher competence and better certification than that available for equivalent proprietary products.

&gt;The real world is full of a heterogeneous mix of different software, hardware systems and applications that interconnect and run various things from customer services to factories to bank transactions (atms) to life support systems to traffic lights to salary payments...in the real world, real sysadmins have to work with a plethora of real systems from many vendors, and for some of those systems you absolutely need innovative proprietary software vendors who employ the industries brightest and proper round the clock access to the the people who wrote the software, not a bunch of amateur hackers. 

I think you grotesquely misrepresent open source software and the open source community here as elsewhere in your post.  Open source code and software is used for serious projects in many fields, from [NASA's Mars Rovers](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=968798), through [air traffic control](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/news/air-traffic-control-radar-display-published-open-source), to [healthcare software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_healthcare_software), and yes, even in [banking](http://news.efinancialcareers.com/4566/a-lot-of-investment-banks-are-using-open-source-software-but-techies-shouldnt-worry/) and the [stock](http://blogs.computerworld.com/london_stock_exchange_to_abandon_failed_windows_platform) [exchange](http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/open-enterprise/2009/10/open-source-makes-big-gains-at-the-london-stock-exchange/index.htm).",0,1335859572,null,0,false,0,c4ioetz,t3_szkbc,t1_c4ioetz,t1_c4ik2hs,null,1428832301,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

&gt;An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers. UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this means that if the Champions League winner falls outside of its domestic league's top four, it will qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. No association can have more than four entrants in the Champions League.

The citations leave a little to be desired though.

edit: Found [this page](http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/fans/faqs/who-qualifies-to-play-in-europe/) on the Premier League site confirming the above.

Interestingly, it also points out that if Chelsea win the CL they will not only get CL qualification: they will also be going directly into the group stage, leaving the third placed league team to go through a qualification match first.

We have been through so much together - even had the odd war or two - but we still managed to be best friends for all this time.

Yesterday I was hanging out with the Channel Islands. Those guys are cool but lax gun laws and racism are no replacement for Whiskey and Battered Mars Bars. 

I guess what I'm saying is that I don't know what I'd do if you stopped wanting to be in the Union. 

In the past you've always had my back, even when we went through that whole thing with Ireland (Who I hear is doing ok, although the financial crisis hit them hard).

Wales is crying itself to sleep every night because it is worried about us fighting, and Gibraltar is fed up of me calling them while drunk. 

Couldn't you find it in your heart to forgive and forget? 

Love,

England


P.S - The Falklands called and told me to say hello. Apparently they're being bullied by that Argentina again.

P.P.S - If you stay we promise to stop making fun of Glasgow

true,beard-maketh-the-man,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Indeed there is:

The recent debate over copyright laws like SOPA in the United States and the ACTA agreement in Europe has been very emotional. And I think some dispassionate, quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate. I'd therefore like to propose that we employ, we enlist, the cutting edge field of copyright math whenever we approach this subject.

For instance, just recently the Motion Picture Association revealed that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year to copyright theft. Now rather than just argue about this number, a copyright mathematician will analyze it and he'll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across Ocean Boulevard to the Westin, and then to Mars ... (Laughter) ... if we use pennies.

Now this is obviously a powerful, some might say dangerously powerful, insight. But it's also a morally important one. Because this isn't just the hypothetical retail value of some pirated movies that we're talking about, but this is actual economic losses. This is the equivalent to the entire American corn crop failing along with all of our fruit crops, as well as wheat, tobacco, rice, sorghum -- whatever sorghum is -- losing sorghum.

But identifying the actual losses to the economy is almost impossible to do unless we use copyright math. Now music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year since Napster first came on the scene. So that's a chunk of what we're looking for. But total movie revenues across theaters, home video and pay-per-view are up. And TV, satellite and cable revenues are way up. Other content markets like book publishing and radio are also up. So this small missing chunk here is puzzling.

(Laughter)

(Applause)

Since the big content markets have grown in line with historic norms, it's not additional growth that piracy has prevented, but copyright math tells us it must therefore be foregone growth in a market that has no historic norms -- one that didn't exist in the 90's. What we're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy. (Laughter) 50 billion dollars of it a year, which is enough, at 30 seconds a ringtone, that could stretch from here to Neanderthal times. (Laughter) It's true. (Applause) I have Excel.

(Laughter)

The movie folks also tell us that our economy loses over 370,000 jobs to content theft, which is quite a lot when you consider that, back in '98, the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that the motion picture and video industries were employing 270,000 people. Other data has the music industry at about 45,000 people. And so the job losses that came with the Internet and all that content theft, have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries. And this is just one of the many mind-blowing statistics that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day. And some people think that string theory is tough.

(Laughter)

Now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians' toolkit. It's the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single copyrighted song or movie gets pirated. Hollywood and Congress derived this number mathematically back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages and made this law. Some people think this number's a little bit large, but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts are merely surprised that it doesn't get compounded for inflation every year.

Now when this law first passed, the world's hottest MP3 player could hold just 10 songs. And it was a big Christmas hit. Because what little hoodlum wouldn't want a million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket.

(Laughter)

(Applause)

These days an iPod Classic can hold 40,000 songs, which is to say eight billion dollars-worth of stolen media. (Applause) Or about 75,000 jobs.

(Laughter)

(Applause)

Now you might find copyright math strange, but that's because it's a field that's best left to experts. So that's it for now. I hope you'll join me next time when I will be making an equally scientific and fact-based inquiry into the cost of alien music piracy to he American economy.

Thank you very much.

(Applause)

Thank you.

Shortages are generally in the parts of the country where there are actually jobs to be worked.

&gt;If a person cant own more than X amount of houses how about a business ? 

It depends. As housing is such an important social necessity, I think only not-for-profit landlords (i.e. as you mentioned, housing associations) should be allowed to hold large portfolios of homes. I don't have all the answers, I just know that the current system isn't working (except for those who already own and/or have rich parents to help them onto the ladder).

&gt;There is a shit load of empty houses out there, there is no shortage in the UK. 

When did I claim there was a shortage of housing? I said there's a shortage of **affordable** housing. I'd like to see you argue that there isn't - since most charities, councils, prospective buyers AND the government disagree with you.

&gt;Yes there is a problem when it comes service personal like nurses firemen etc etc, but there are schemes in place to help them.

There are also schemes in place to 'help' first time buyers, as successive governments have acknowledged that average house prices (and increasingly rent) are rising much, much faster than average wages and many are struggling to move out of mum and dads house (if they're lucky enough to be allowed to stay..).",0,1335871822,null,0,false,0,c4ipe2l,t3_t1bhj,t1_c4ipe2l,t1_c4ip8c7,null,1428832762,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Remove all the victimless crimes (drugs, etc) and what are you left with?

Automotive crimes/accidents/etc. Google has a working prototype of an autonomous vehicle. This vehicle would be infinitely safer than it's human counterpart. No accidents, no drunk drivers, no insurance needed.

The only things left after that are theft (distruction/theft of property) and violence (rape, murder, GBH)

But 300 years away is such a long time away that it's silly to think we can imagine what we will have in place then.

In addition Scotland would be able to borrow money to finance infrastructure problems, rather than having them prioritised against the demands of the rest of the UK.

It doesn't seem likely that taxes would have to be raised, nor free university places scrapped, in the short term. The Scottish government expenditure is pretty much in line with Scotland's contribution to UK revenue (i.e., those ""free places"" aren't being subsidised by English taxpayers, they're being paid for by Scottish taxpayers).

Scotland would continue to use the pound, and there are no plans to join the Euro (that was the SNP's position a few years back, but they no longer advocate it: and it seems unlikely Scottish Labour or the Scottish Conservatives would if the referendum passed).

Armed forces would be needed, however they would be drastically smaller than those of the UK. It's unlikely they would be participating in (m)any US-led wars like Iraq/Afghanistan (or future conflicts like Iran) so, like many other small countries, it's perfectly possible to have a small defence force.

Your ""FREEEEEEDOM"" comment is nonsense: Scottish independence is about increased political autonomy, not some American Tourist idea of oppression.

Hardly anyone has any form of Empire in the direct rule sense, that age is long gone. Even if it wasn't, the UK is no longer the dominant world power.

However, we remain a top-10 world economy despite not actually making anything. This would be impossible without value being transfered to us from the developing world.

I agree, European colonialism was generally a brutal thing and Britain was not unique in this. Britain *was* unique in being the global hegemon for 100 years, and committed unique crimes as a result. The Mau-Mau was merely one bad incident; I have a wonderful photo in a book on my shelf of a Tommy proudly holding up a severed Malaysian head, also 1950s. Bengal famine? Crushing the Sikhs for being ""the world's largest armed democracy""? Managing the AfPak hill tribes with ""butcher and bolt"" tactics?

Britain's attempts to strut its stuff in the present day are indeed a bit pathetic; a supporting actor to the American hegemon.

A few weeks (well probably a month and a half or so now) ago our doorbell rang at about 22:20. Me and all my housemates were all kind of confused as to why someone was ringing the doorbell, so me and my housemate James went down to investigate. Opened the door, and there's this really scruffy/scummy looking woman stood at the door asking if she can come in because some man has been following her with a knife all day. Eventually we said we'd take her to the pub at the corner for a bit (The Bold Forester on Albert Rd/Fawcett Rd, as it's pretty much next door to us). We got about half way there when she stopped, and sat down against a wall and got out a can of special brew or something from her bag. 

We ended up there for about 40 minutes, while she went through various moods, going from singing really loudly (which got us dodgy looks from passers by), offering me and my housemate a threesome (ಠ_ಠ) and trying to persuade us to buy her some food from Ken's. Eventually she suddenly got really hostile and was all ""WHERE'S THE CHIPS YOU PROMISED ME"" and generally aggro at us. The best quote of the night ""Oh you like watching me get raped, don't you?"", which confused me and James enough that we just decided to leave her to her own devices. Did a lap round the block, she'd gone when we got back.

I think the argument that the union works and will continue to work is valid, however it's also true that in many ways the two countries are becoming more different rather than less.

E.g., the UK is aiming to produce 30% of its electricity from renewables by 2020: Scotland already produces 35% of its electricity from renewables and is aiming for 100% by 2020. Now that's partly because of better geography for wind/tidal power, and that it's got a much smaller population to cover, but I think there is a difference in emphasis as well. No mainstream UK politician is proposing to be anything like as ambitious.

You can see a similar effect in public health - there was a 17% drop in heart attack admissions in the year following the smoking ban being introduced in Scotland, a ban which wasn't introduced in England until a year later.

We have a lot of long-standing problems with public health and employment in Scotland, and I think that having our seat of government 40 miles away from those issues rather than 400 miles away would do a lot to focus our minds. As would, of course, the very idea that we were now independent: we would have nobody to blame for our ills but ourselves.

Cole/Aquilani are a worry due to reports about their clubs not wanting to activate a transfer. Cole has been out of form for a while and has lost a starting spot, and Milan are close to making the appearances requirement on Aquilani but are holding off on playing him; fluffing frustrating how they take our player who does well for them for a season, we pay a portion of his wages and they simply disregard him and ship him back to us. Poor negotiation on our part really.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"Ahahaha I got caught there. Serves me right. A few things though. Where did they say on his wikipedia page the reasons for buying Kuyt? I don't doubt that we bought him for the attributes that got those goals, but it's ridiculous to say that buying someone who has gotten &gt;20 goals every season does not come with some expectations of goal scoring. 

Lucas was considered a failure for the majority of '08 and quite some bit of '09. Has he evolved into a good defensive midfielder? Yes. Did he take time to do it? Yes. The fact that he became a good defensive midfielder is practically an accident, because I am sure as hell Rafa did not buy him to be an anchorman. 

Yes, the DoF is supposed to bring in players with potential to improve. What I was trying to say is that Xabi wasn't exactly brought in as a ""top-tier"" player, unlike Mascherano or Torres. Alonso was captain at Sociedad, kinda like Adam was captain at Blackpool. If Adam turns out to be a world-beater in a couple of years, I'll be ecstatic, but I won't turn around and deny that he was brought in as a squad player. Benitez surely had high hopes for Alonso, but he wasn't brought in with the recognition that he was a top player, and he wasn't expected to be one. 

The departure of Arbeloa means that Insua was the only senior leftback in the team, especially since Benitez let Aurelio leave. Woy let Insua go off on loan, that's true. It doesn't take away the fact that he took over a squad with only 1 left-back, a 21-year old with only about 1.5 years of senior experience. Obviously Woy later did worse by letting him to on loan, re-signing Aurelio and ultimately signing Konchesky, but you can't absolve Benitez for leaving the club with 1 left-back. 

I never denied that Benitez had massive successes. Nobody expected Torres to turn out as good as he did. Nobody expected Xabi Alonso to be as good as he is. The problem is that for every ""*massive success*"" Rafa had, he had massive failures in the form of Crouch, Keane, Babel and even Aquilani to some extend. This is why I don't want him as a DoF (honestly I don't even know why we're having this argument since there is not much chance of him wanting to take a Director job instead of being a coach), because when you lay out ONLY his transfer record, the guy is a high-risk, high-reward investment. His buys have a good chance of exploding on the world stage, or blowing up in your face. Frankly, we need to take things slowly and steadily now, not risk have bombs blow up in our faces.

Sure we might be able to express ourselves internationally a bit more, but its not one the major topics concerning independence. The real reason, for me at least and plenty others, is that politically and economically Scotland has become too different from the UK. Politically we're more left wing country and in my life time there hasn't been a left wing UK government. I think new labour is a big factor in the shift towards independence because they've abandoned a lot of their traditional values and supporters leaving the SNP as the best option available for a lot of people, allowing them to become the dominant force in scottish politics. Scotland also has different political needs compared England, for example immigration isn't as big an issue up here as it in down there and we've taken a very different approach to key policy areas such Health and Education. One of the big reasons I support independence is to get away from the disastrous approach to foreign policy we've had in the past decade, I don't think these wars are necessary or beneficial to wider society whether that be Scottish, British or who we've invaded.

I don't think it would make a huge economic difference either way, at least in the short run, but I would like to think that the political situation would develop so Scotland could follow the Nordic model and the benefits that that could bring, and embrace Europe and our place in it, rather than the path we seem to be going down as part of the UK.  But equally I think independence could allow Scots of a more conservative bent to express that, as the associations of Toryism would be put aside.  I also think there is a clear Scottish identity though, and while I don't think that necessitates independence I think it is certainly a factor to consider.

I'm definitely not set on independence, I would probably vote yes because I think it would be incredibly interesting to see what happens, but I think equally a more federal UK would achieve what I want to see.

However, the more I hear in the press that an independent Scotland couldn't survive, would go broke, would be a nothing, the more I feel like getting away from it.  The figures don't back this up and I've heard nothing to suggest what makes Scotland so different from the likes of Denmark and Norway who are some of the most successful countries out there.  Make a positive case for why Scotland benefits from being a part of the UK instead of trying to put the fear in us.

4-1-3-2 Formation:
Di Matteo's been playing Mata in the center behind the striker lately and obviously it's done wonders both for Mata and for the team's run of form so if it ain't broke don't fix it. 

Meireles and Scorres work well together, the same can be said for Ramires and Drogs. Meireles lining up to the left of Torres and Ramires to the right of Drogs can see the two strikers vying for plenty of attacking opportunities.

Cole, despite challenges from Bertrand, is still our number one left back and our most clutch defender. Ivanovic on the right as well. They should need no explanations. Cahill and David Luiz can be interchanged and you could even throw in Bosingwa in the mix as well because for all the criticism that's been thrown at Bosingwa at RB, he's done solid as a makeshift CB and seems to be much more comfortable.

The one weak spot that concerns me is leaving Mikel as the only man separating Meireles/Mata/Ramires and our back four. If Meireles can't back track quickly into our defensive third, it could mean trouble.

It works better as a change-up substitution. Have Drogba play the first 60 as a powerful, ball-controlling, aerial master, and bludgeon the defense into exhaustion. Then bring Torres on, suddenly we have a lightning fast, through-ball chasing maestro. Its basically impossible for a defense to stop BOTH big and strong + fast and agile. They'd have to be big and strong and fast and agile, which doesn't happen. Its terrifying. 

I think they can work together, and will be a potent attacking force when they do. But when they play together, they must compromise on their preferred style. We can play Drogba-style, and Torres will be out of sorts. Or play Torres-style, and Drogba gets frustrated. Or something in the middle, and both of them are less effective than they should be.

No. We are different, but then Cornwall folk are different from Kentish folk from Newcastle folk. People are different within countries too, and that's fine.

More this. I don't like the authoritarian slant most Scots favour, nor the government using tax and legislation for social engineering, but overall Scotland clearly desires a system with greater social welfare than the rUK, and I do not like the way the rUK is going with private police, the destruction of the NHS, etc.

The UK I lived in growing up worked and worked well. That said, these days I do fear that the Scotland I live in now and what's becoming of the rest of the UK is growing increasingly different. It seems strange to me because it's not Scotland which is really changing, but rUK.

I do agree that he should go, though, but only because the Aquaman is on his way back.

Hear me out. Aquilani, and I doubt there are many if any who could disagree, had some quite promising displays in a Liverpool shirt, most notably a goal scoring/assist performance against Everton. I was reading a statistical analysis of Aquilani in comparison to the top midfielders in England, and his pass conversion rate, tackle rate, and goals-shots rate is superior to that of any premier league counterpart. Now that Aquilani has had a somewhat steady run with two major clubs, even challenging for top honors, he would be the perfect man to sit in a 2 man midfield with Lucas, and allow Gerrard the free-roaming, free-playing role he so truly flourishes in.

true,samsari,scottish,Scottish exile,"Even though I won't be voting as I live abroad now, I am definitely in favour of independence. For me, and I can't speak for anyone else obviously, it's very much about politics and economics. 

I am a proponent in principle for stronger and more effective local government, and so I think Scotland is suffering by having such a distant government in Westminster. In this new era that we live in, they cannot adequately represent the specific needs of the Scottish region. And before anyone suggests it ironically, yes I am in favour of devolution to several regions of England too. Ideally, I'd like to see a properly federal British Isles.

However, I do think culture does come into it as well. Scotland is generally more progressive and centre-left than the centre-right conservative England. The Scottish Parliament has been great, but it's not enough, there are still far too many reserved matters. All the really important ones are not in the hands of MSPs. While Scotland of 5m people is bolted onto the side of the rUK of 55m people, its social democratic leanings will never be allowed to be fully realised.

EDIT: To answer your question, I suppose hypothetically I could be persuaded otherwise, but I don't believe there's any realistic thing that could be offered to make me want to. Just about the only thing I'd accept is a fundamental rearchitecting of the UK, and that's frankly never ever going to happen to the UK as it is now. Maybe the best thing is for Scotland to leave, the rUK to devolve into a collection of similarly sized semi-autonomous regions, and then we all come back together as a more equal federation of sovereign countries.",0,1335901363,null,0,true,0,c4iuner,t3_t1a6v,t1_c4iuner,t1_c4iqzdp,null,1428835307,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; is your decision based on a separate identity which you feel is better expressed as an independent nation or is it based on the politics and economics of the last few years or decades?

Both really - I definitely feel more ""Scottish"" than ""British"", however I also believe that devolution has been very successful. Both in terms of what it's carried out, but also in that it has showed that alternatives to the crazy first-past-the-post used by Westminster work just fine.

Devolution has emphasised the differences between ""UK politics"" (Westminster) and ""Scottish politics"" (Holyrood), and watching how Holyrood is reported (or not) in the national UK media does tend to reinforce this.

&gt; Also, are your feelings so strong that there is absolutely nothing that can be done to persuade you otherwise?

I am in no way a ""CyberNat"", and have never voted for the SNP. However I will be voting yes to independence, as I do think that independence is what's best for both Scotland and for the UK as a whole.

For Scotland because it is an opportunity to decide what kind of nation we want to be.

For the UK because it will cause a similar period of reflection (the UK went from controlling 20% of the world's population some 90 years ago to a much smaller nation today, and I think that trajectory will continue).

Edit: one thing I would *really* like to see would be a party making an effective pro-Unionist argument which wasn't rooted in ""you're too small/poor/weak"" or ""what if Inverness/Shetland/Orkney wanted to split off"" or ""but what will you do when there's no more oil"".

12am. At midnight. Where most kids are asleep. And they still had to bleep coarse language because of ""common practice""? Complete Bullshit!

Problem is that they don't have to do it, as FCC indecency regulations do not apply to cable. Adults pay for cable, yet they are subject to bowdlerized content/PG13 censorship? 

Here's the real reason why they do it: Fear of advertisers pulling their ads because of coarse language. What's worse, many american cable networks have standards and practices that reflect what advertisers standards want.

The real question I should asking is why BBC American viewers put up with this shit?

Another reason why I don't watch cable: Cable networks treat adults like 13 year olds when it comes to mature material.",0,1335903289,null,0,false,0,c4iv4ia,t3_t07jx,t1_c4iv4ia,t3_t07jx,null,1428835530,3,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"He can't take us farther. I really think that he's reached his limits. He's great at taking a good mid level team and bringing them up but I think we need someone else at the helm if we want to consistently challenge for top 4.  

Redknapp is playing in the big leagues now...there's a very big difference between top managers like SAF and Mancini and mid level managers like Hodgson or Dalglish. I think Redknapp sits in between those two levels. He's much better than the average mid level manager but can't really compete over a whole season with the top level managers.

And let's also consider how early we exited the Europa League and how, during our downfall, we only had the FA Cup and the League to focus on. Not Champions League or Europa league or even the Carling Cup. We should have beaten teams like Chelsea or Arsenal who had spread themselves too thin, but we didn't. Even though we had our focus solely on the league (and somewhat on the cup) we still managed to screw up. This is the fault of both the manager and the players, but mostly on the manager. His job is to rotate, make sure players don't get worn out or injured from overplaying, develop tactics to fit the players he's going to play , and more. Not pick the same line up and tactics every match, and when the same line up can't be taken take different players and try to shoehorn them into the same lineup the starters play. 

We need a change at the top, I think. Someone who's able to adapt to all the challenges of the season, someone multi dimensional. Harry isn't it, really. ",0,1335904179,null,0,false,0,c4ivcle,t3_t1iza,t1_c4ivcle,t1_c4iv4he,null,1428835638,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Few other random thoughts:

* Coates looked fairly solid up until the last 10-15min.
* Sterling is hungry to play.
* Doni was surprisingly good. Good stops against Dempsey and Riise. 

The only position I'm unsure about for Saturday is LB, could very well see Agger there again.

He just brings so much spark and life to the squad. Giving the younger guys the chance to play with him does wonders for their creativity. Not to mention the middle was wide open all match. 

Still, a lot of youth today. Coates, Henderson, Shelvey, Carroll, Kelly, Sterling, Spearing etc. I don't think any of us expected them to blow Fulham out of the water. Good to see them getting some action.

The effort was also really getting to me.  Yes, they were moving their legs and sweating, but no one was taking chances!  Fulham could defend standing still for most of the match.  The closest thing to chances were clearly offside runs.

Everyone in the midfield really disappointed me.  I think it all starts and ends there, so it is hard for me to criticize the striker and defenders.  Spearing, to me, was awful the entire game.  He runs hard, but he can't put in a good pass or defend to save his life.  I can't say much better about anyone else playing in the center of the park.  I thought Shelvey was the brightest player out there, but even he was just minimizing mistakes and not doing much positive work.

McManaman said it during the match, players look like they were just trying to not make mistakes (and failing at it...) and they weren't trying to win.  I know this match supposedly doesn't matter, but I don't enjoy watching what I just saw.

Admittedly, our previous vice-chancellor was, to put it politely, not very good, and his replacement is working hard to improve. We do struggle for money, because we have one of if not the lowest tuition fees in the country. We currently have two student union bars, one in central London called the Hub (Near Liverpool Street Station) and the other on Holloway road, called the Rocket. The Hub hosts no events, and despite being regularly patronised by the students is about half the size of the Rocket. the Hub is the location which is unlikely to have it's lease renewed, especially as a number of courses are being moved away from City campus next year.

On top of all of this, we are scoring more goals then with AVB and conceding fewer and furthermore Torres looks better then he's ever looked in a Blue shirt, as well as the rest of the team is showing their best sides.

My only concern is his youth policy, but we've hardly seen the youngsters play since he took over, but I think that's mainly due to the fact that almost every games been a season defining one since he took charge and he can't afford to take any risks at all.

So overall I'll be very disappointed if he ISN'T hired for one year at the least. I don't care what other coach is available, in my opinion he has MORE than earned a contract extension and I feel almost like we're insulting him by not having done so already.

true,literallyoverthemoon,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"Scottish parliamentary results have no bearing on where in the UK the political chasm lies. If a party with the same policies and campaign as the SNP ran for parliament in the north of England, I'd bet a considerable amount that they would do as well as their SNP brethren do in Scotland. 

What exactly do you mean by 'far higher support'? Do you mean that they won a higher proportion of seats in Scotland than elsewhere? If you consider the map you posted, then it is clear that Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, Sheffield, also showed far higher support for Labour and the Lib Dems than they did for the Conservatives. The majority of major cities in the north of England (which is of course where the majority of people live) share the voting patterns of Scotland. 

You have forgotten to take population density into account in your analysis of this map. [The proportional map](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/), adjusted to ignore the geographical size of constituencies, gives a much clearer indication of where the divide occurs. 

What we actually see is a political divide between the urban and rural, UK wide, which as you acknowledge, is exemplified in the results from the Scottish Borders constituencies, as well as greater Conservative support in the south of England. 

In fact, as of the 2007 Local council elections, the Conservatives hold absolutely no council seats in Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle or Sheffield; the metropolitan areas of which have a greater combined population than Scotland.

The political divisions in this country stem from the economic histories of the the areas either side of the chasm, and these economic histories are shared across the Scotish/English border. The north/south divide is observed as running from the Severn to the Humber to a far, far greater extent than was ever observed from Bowness to Berwick.

Anyway, enough ravings about Aurelio. (We should play him against Chelsea).

There was very little flow to our game, the football  was sluggish and the midfield either gave the ball away or played it back to the defense  90% of the time.  It was a very different team who are not used to playing together, and it showed. No spark apart from occasional chances up front, but I will say the defense was reasonable for the most part (discounting the unlucky own goal of course).

All the same, I think  it was good that we showed a different team. Frankly it doesn't REALLY matter where we finish now..

true,[deleted],null,null,"That's an incredibly un-nuanced view, and pessimistic in both the likely prospects of Scotland and in the morals of the English.  I'll go through your points though...

Oil - What do you mean?  That it doesn't cover the entire GDP? Well that's bleeding obvious.  However, it would make up a significant proportion, more so to Scotland than it does to the UK as a whole.  Too much is made of the oil though - it would be an important part of Scotland's economy, but it isn't the be all and end all.

The army - nobody knows what would happen in full detail, but it's generally accepted that there would be negotiations between Scotland and the rest of the UK to determine if and how it should be split up.  This would probably be a logistical nightmare but it would be achievable.  Scotland has paid for a share of the army through taxes over the years so would receive something equivalent to this.  If not...

Debt - ...if Scotland didn't receive a share of the assets then it couldn't be expected to receive a share of the debt either.  However, most sane people realise that both of these would be split.  A proportional share of the UK debt would be quite high for Scotland, but that's because the UK's debt is quite high.  But regardless, basically every country in the world has debts.  Scotland has a lower fiscal deficit than the rest of the UK does so it at least wouldn't grow as fast.  As for the IMF downgrading us - who knows what the future holds.  I'm not an economist, but I have read people who are say that ratings aren't the be all and end all.  It's pointless to speculate what Scotland's economy would be like in 5 years time - but for what it's worth, the UK as a whole [is hardly rosy](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/01/24/imf-britain-growth-forecast-economic-recession_n_1227691.html).

Passport - This is just willfully ignorant.  That is a bizarrely pessimistic view of your countrymen, they are far less petty than that.  An open border with Ireland is ok but not Scotland because of spite? Please.  Regardless, I expect it would remain possible to keep a British passport, I don't see Britain forcing people to give up citizenship.  Plus it is almost certain that both Scotland and the rest of the UK would remain in the EU - perhaps it would take a couple of years to formalise but I can't see a situation where they would make it hard for two prosperous countries to remain within the organisation.

Banks - English businessmen a parochial and spiteful again, got it.  You have a wonderfully low view of your country there.  You will ""demand the RBS money back"", will you?  If you can't see that RBS, with 90% of its operations in England, was as important for the English and UK economy as a whole as it was for Scotland then you aren't trying very hard.  I could cite international precedent at you but you don't seem the type to listen.  I have heard some economists cite that RBS is expected to return to profitability in the future at any rate, so a share of the ownership may not be such a bad thing.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"I don't think Redknapp is going to change or improve at this point in his career. He's been managing for about 30 years. 

Sir Alex was in his 40s and only in his 12th year of management in 1989, so he had a lot more time to get his shit together. There's also the fact that he's an entirely different class of manager. Harry could coach for 100 years and probably never reach that level.

Harry is what he is at this point in his career and life. Either we have to accept that or try to move on. 

Personally to me it still hinges entirely on whether or not we'll have Champions League football next year. If we go on, win the rest of our games and finish 4th (with Bayern taking care of business) okay fine, keep the guy for at least another year. I won't be terribly thrilled about it because I think I've had enough of it, but 4th place isn't exactly a bad season. 

But if we finish 5th or 6th, I'd have no problems stepping back for a few years and starting over with another coach who could implement a philosophy and build a team around that. We'll have a new stadium probably within 5-6 years and maybe we can set ourselves up to compete once that time rolls around. 

I've never been a massive Harry Redknapp fan so I'm incapable of looking at this objectively. That said, I think he's taken us as far as he can at this point, and I wouldn't be surprised if some of our players are growing weary of his management style.

true,SpasticPanda,flair2,,"&gt;I played my strongest team in every possible game in football manager (various editions) and every time my results died around early march till I tried squad rotation.

This is a heap of shit. Sorry dude, but these guys are professional athletes playing competitively usually only once a week. If they complain of being tired, they need to hit the treadmill and cut back on the beers. If they were playing every day in multiple back to backs, I would accept this, but they ain't.

So far as I can see, it is a tactical problem. Teams just figured out how to shut down out key players. Rotation is important because it changes things up and doesn't give opposing managers a chance to adjust defensively. Running the same team, week in, week out, is going to eventually get figured out. Bale drifting to the middle and clogging it up doesn't help. Until 'Arry figures this out, he is really going to struggle. 

I like Redknapp, he appears at face value to care, and he is funny and obviously has great rapport with the players. There is definitely value in him as a manager. But either he needs to hit the books, or he needs to hire support which does. If we get Mourinho, great.

Really it comes down to these next three matches for me. If he looks like he cares... Well I'll overlook her cheating past.

Tactically speaking he is a better defender then Drogba, he defends superbly and can go from one side of the pitch to the other very quickly. If we play a strong defensive game against Bayern in Munich it will also need to be a clean game. Drogba has gotten into a habit of fouling attacking players and this has become a liability especially in a game that could easily be decided by a penalty.

However, in the FA cup final Drogba would do well. Especially considering the fact that we will hopefully have Cahill, and Luiz (or at worst just one) back from injury the added 9th or 10th man in our box wont be necessary. Drogba however, will have the strength needed to overwhelm the red defense. Basically for the FA I would like to see a starting 11 look something like this

There are a few players I really think we need to get rid of, and it's vital that we strengthen the team, and that doesn't mean bringing in one player who can contest for the starting eleven, but getting a number of players in to put pressure on those in the starting eleven and who will suit us for different tactical approaches. We can't go to every ground playing the same football, at the moment plan b is subbing off VDV with 15minutes to go and switching to a 442, something needs to change in this area as we don't have any tricks up our sleeve.

I heard that Lennon and Parker may both be unfit to play vs Bolton later, and if I see Saha starting alongside Adebayor with VDV on the right i'm going to flip my lid.

true,thecritic06,cnty-wales,Aberystwyth Yorkshireman,"Hell, I've long been contemplating it myself. We really are fucked, both as individuals and as a species. As individuals, the likelihood is that we'll spend the majority of our lives having our labour exploited for profit. That is, after all, the basis of the entire private sector. The number of dream careers available and the number of people who want them are extremely disparate, so the chances are that we'll never be what we want to. Aspirational products just hypnotize people into continuing toiling away at their utterly pointless jobs.

Those things which make us happy, be they games consoles or TVs or iPods or whatever are likely drenched in human blood, which few people seem to give a shit about. All the earth's resources are being consumed at an utterly unsustainable rate. The world's economy is based on physically impossible perpetual exponential growth and utilizes vast amounts of imaginary money on which we must pay interest.

Perhaps the worst thing of all, more so than the incredible greed of a small minority of individuals which is the root cause of most of our problems, is the apathy with which the vast majority of people particularly in first world countries treat the above issues. We wear our blinkers and shuffle backwards and forwards between our bed and our place of employment, eagerly anticipating the two days a week *graciously granted* to us by Mr Tesco or whoever to recover from the grind. We consider maybe a new phone. That would surely make us happy. And it does, for about 20 minutes, until we're convinced that it is now redundant, more of a millstone than a technological wonder, and that we must begin again. An endless pursuit of the unattainable things which will make us happy.

For someone in a minority group, or on the fringes of social circles, life can be even worse. Things you never chose mean that people reject you outright or seek to legislate against you. You get blamed for peoples' shitty lives because you're an immigrant or gay or on benefits. Life is even worse if you're in a desperately poor country, we're told. 'Appreciate what you have, because others haven't!' As though that fucking helps. All it does is magnify the self-hatred, as though our dissatisfaction with the world is illegitimate somehow.

I really can't blame religious people for wanting there to be something after this, something better, happiness. Religions are ultimately death cults. The opiate of the masses, the sigh of the oppressed peoples. People want to escape this shit. People *could* escape this shit if we put the executives against the wall and started running this world for our own good rather than for the good of the ultra rich. Will that happen? Not until people kill each-other over the last scraps of precious valuable plastic in the world, or shoot innocent civilians who happen to live in an oil-producing country or over an untouched aquifer or lump of lithium.

The planet is being raped, humanity at large is being raped, and we're turning our heads the other way and gazing into our iPhones and ignoring the screams.

Forgive my hackneyed nihilism, but being hackneyed doesn't make it false. Greed condemns humanity to failure. Maybe in a hundred million years a new sentient species evolved from slime moulds will excavate the remains of Homo Sapiens' Babylon and begin to understand what destructive forces led to our demise and how easily it could all have been avoided if enough people stood up against it. More likely, they will repeat our mistakes.

I don't blame this kid for killing himself. Marx said ""All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses, his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind."" That's all this kid did. Saw the real conditions of life. The heart of darkness, I suppose.

Uh, because he stopped and allowed all his cronies to laugh at the implication that she's sexually frustrated - i.e. unattractive, unworthy of sexual attention and generally unfuckable.

Again, this would probably be sexual harassment in many workplaces. I can't recall whether or not the original intent of his choice of words is apparent, but it was clear that he understood the innuendo during his pause and he made no attempt to stop the giggling (his own, never mind anyone else's), to apologise or to accept responsibility. For some minutes he allowed her to the butt of a sex joke - if you didn't see this exchange at the time, I suggest you look it up on YouTube. 

With an ostensibly-female username, you of all people should know that women are judged to a different set of standards from men. Of the 450+ male MPs, none of them are insulted on their sexual performance or on how sexually desirable they are. A handful of male MPs might be considered fat or ugly, but in a different context from the woman's role of being pleasing to men.

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"&gt;Honestly if a person cannot laugh at themselves when they make mistakes they really don't deserve the accolades for their best when they come along.

But the poster wasn't talking about a ""mistake"". He (or she) was suggesting that someone who has served his or her country for decades, excelling in their given field of endeavor, be asked to pretend to fall, so that an actor famous for playing a television character can hold the Olympic Flame for a bit, delighting some fans and confusing (and most likely offending) the hell out of others. 

That sounds so ridiculous to type, I can't believe the idea has any kind of traction.

The Olympics are one of the few things in entertainment that are bigger than *Doctor Who*. They've been around for a couple of years more. And the Olympics aren't about science fiction. They're not about David Tennant. They're not about *Doctor Who* fandom. They're not about *Doctor Who*. They are about sports. 

I mean, by the logic here, the Doctor should have inaugurated the Cricket World Cup (*Black Orchid*), or even the FIFA World Cup (""The Lodger""). At least, in those two stories, he demonstrated some prowess in those sports, but thankfully, fans aren't circulating a petition to have Peter Davison or Matt Smith do a lap of honour with the respective trophies, while the participating teams look bemusedly on. Since apparently everybody on the planet watches *Doctor Who*, nobody should mind. 

&gt;DW has always delivered

Like in the late 1980s, for example, known popularly as ""The Second Golden Age of *Doctor Who*"". Followed shortly thereafter by the 1990s, known as ""The Decade When *Doctor Who* Was On Air Every Year"". 

There were 15 years when *Doctor Who* was off the air. It didn't deliver. 

&gt;DW is cheesy, they know it and run with it gladly. The Olympics hasn't gotten their memo yet.

I'm not entirely sure I understand what one has to do with the other. *Doctor Who* is cheesy, yes. The Olympics takes itself slightly more seriously, as it is entitled to. 

EDIT: It also strikes me that no official *Doctor Who*-related source has advocated the idea of David Tennant lighting the Olympic Flame. The only public push for this campaign has come from the fans. Not Tennant, Davies, Matthew Graham (the writer), Steven Moffat, the BBC, or anyone who has, or had, a definitive role in either ""Fear Her"" in particular, or *Doctor Who* in general.

true,OriginalEnough,eng-norfolk,Norfolk,"This interests me because I wasn't really one of the sporty types at school. (On reddit? Never!) My games of Rugby in the winter consisted of me playing 'how far away from the ball can I stay without looking as if I'm shirking'. Football was a little bit better: I would either stay in defence or in goal, and while generally rubbish at it, still tried to play.

For the winter months, I longed for rainy days, where we would go inside and play badminton. As I was a regular tennis player outside school, I generally enjoyed playing badminton. Not only that, I got to play with my friends; we were all around a similar skill level, not that this matter for 'match selection'.

We also got to try table tennis (couldn't see the ball properly, but was fun nevertheless), basketball and volleyball. I really enjoyed playing volleyball, as it introduced me to a new game that I'd never played before, it being non-contact (mostly) and not mucky also contributing. We learnt how to serve, how to rally and, eventually, how to play a match. We mostly started on even ground; not many of us had played volleyball before, and thus we were all beginners of sorts.

In the summer, there was athletics (of which the running events I hated with a passion) and Cricket. I was fairly good at Cricket, and played for a local junior team. Thus, I tended to enjoy playing it.

My fairly long-winded point is that it's not just girls who are affected by this phenomenon. It's everyone who isn't the PE teachers' pets. Those 'sporty' types who enjoyed - and were good at - playing the games the local schools competed in, such as Football and Rugby for the boys and... I don't know, Netball and whatever else the girls did. There needs to be more focus on variety in PE classes. Cater to the pupil and work with their talents. Of course, everything should be *tried*, but you shouldn't have to dread playing something.

There was one comment on the BBC comments section that caught my eye. One 'Clive Hamilton' wrote,
&gt;Not doing sport, **nor learning how to win and lose** are school are doing untold harm to our kids and our future well being and wealth.

I don't necessarily agree or disagree with it, but the emphasised text is important. Everyone needs to learn how to win and how to lose. (Preferably with grace and dignity, but that's just me.) To do so, everyone needs to be thrown into the deep end more often, so that there is less of a divide of skill. This gives people a better chance to experience both winning and losing, whether you're sporty or not. Even more importantly, what with novelty, it gives everyone a better chance of having fun at least some of the time.",0,1335944257,null,0,false,0,c4j3f3t,t3_t2ycr,t1_c4j3f3t,t3_t2ycr,null,1428839509,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

true,[deleted],null,null,"Sorry to be ""that guy"" but...

When kids are not ""into"" science or maths they are told to do it anyway, it is made a compulsory subject and schools are graded on how many people pass it so they are concentrated on getting it done.

When boys are not interested in something it is because they are ""lazy"" or ""rebellious"" and the jolly well need to knuckle down, turn off their X boxes and be made to get on with it.

But PE and girls?  Well that is another matter.

Aside from how to tie a tie and how to work with people in authority who were nothing more than over grown 5 year olds on a power trip, learning to get on with things I did not personally like was the number one employability skill I got at school.  Rugby in the rain?  No one ""likes"" that, not the boys, not even the sporty, rugby fanatic, had their growth spurt at 10 boys.  Get over it and get on with it.  And what's more:  Actually try and do it.  Don't hide at the back, don't avoid the ball, don't be too frightened to tackle.

The same attitude to a temp job answering the phones in a call centre over the Christmas holiday got me the offer of a 40k a year permanent place there.  The same attitude got me my degree and my current job and my friends and all the experiences I actually value.

When I look back at school I regret the days it was too frosty and we sat inside and watched rugby games on TV much more than the wetest filthiest cold.

Truth be told, it made a man of me and the girls could do with the same IMHO

&gt;MOSCOW - Josef Stalin has been dead for three days, yet many Russians remain as distraught as when the news first broke.

Who can replace so ruthless a tyrant? I doubt Malenkov can summon such pure, pure hatred. As far as I know, he has no paranoid vendetta against academia whatsoever. Stalin was simply one of a kind.""
&gt;Homeless alcoholic Fyodor Alexeyev likewise feels nostalgic for a bygone era. ""I had my farm seized in 1939 under collectivisation and was forced into the Army with minimal training and equipment."" he said. ""After two hellish years in a German P.O.W. camp, I finally returned to beautiful Leningrad, only to be interned in a Russian concentration camp. Now, the great man who put me there has been taken from me. I don't know if I have the strength to go on.""

If I commented here and said ""kids don't enjoy maths, we should dump all this boring, hard equations stuff and let them play number bingo the whole time.  Then when they are older they will play number bingo and we will get more Noble prizes in maths"" would you take me seriously?

The truth is that as adults we all decide how active we want to be (if at all) and we live with the consequences (both the obesity and the sprained ankles).

PE should do 2 things IMO.  Firstly, Introduce kids to a wide range of sports so they know what different types are like (I never played squash at school but when someone explained it to me as ""badminton but faster and harder"" I knew what to expect at least).  Secondly it should be tough.  All subjects should be unflinching, demanding, stretching.

Only ten years ago, my school took sport VERY seriously, to an almost militaristic level. As a boarding school (compare it to a shit version of Harry Potter), all houses had to compete against each other in sports and failure was seen as traitorous. As a plump kid with breathing problems I was a prime target for bullying by the teachers and students, hearing things like ""thanks a lot for finishing last, now we'll never win the sports cup you big baby!"" Like it was the most fucking important thing that any of us would ever do in academia.

This torture was only equalled by the horror of the changing rooms and sports with mixed genders. If you think that teenagers feel awkward and have body image problems at the best of times, stick them in a cramped, cold room full of judgemental bullies and get them to strip. After this then apply an hour of being shouted and laughed at by boys whilst running around a gym, which in any other context would get them reprimanded for sexual harrassment. And to top it all off, make them swim in a bra, t-shirt and PE knickers when they forget their swimming costume as the other childen point at how see-through the t-shirt is when you get out of the water. 

All this will get someone who is quite OK with sport hate it for the rest of their life, and this was the majority of my school's physical education.
(Reddit is good therapy for me).


Anyway, thankfully there were private karate lessons in the area and I got back into sport that way while I was still young. The reason why I and so many others in my school liked it was because it was totally removed from all of the ritualistic torture; sure there was some healthy competiton, but for the most part it was about self improvement and we were rewarded for learning the moves calmly and in a friendly atmosphere. Why do schools not understand these concepts? 

I genuinely think the only reason students go on to do PE as a subject after suffering through all that nonsense is if they genuinely want to persue a career in sport/PE or can't make the grades in other subjects. And I don't know how it is today, but when I was in school it was simply: Football and Rugby for boys; Netball, Rounders and Hockey for girls.

Can anyone name a famous Rounders player?

As for mixed gender sports like running, athletics and swimming, it was made pretty clear to us that you should not continue participating if you were not ""winning material"", thus even if you were really keen on, for example running, but didn't get into the top 5 in the school races it was best that you stuck to the classroom. God forbid that the teachers would try to develop talent and passion in anyone!


I can only hope that this has changed since I left school, but from the PE horror stories that I keep hearing every so often, the subject suffers most from a lack of funds and imagination from the school. Introducing (sigh) zumba or publicising more female role models won't change a bloody thing if this kind of bizarre teaching is not irradicated.

Nothing special about it, I just have a thing for little hidden gems - quiet corners where you can forget your in suburbia for a while.
With a little research came across a book with some info about it and seems the maze is called the Eye of the Storm and the sculpture [The Whirlwind ](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/The_vortex%2C_Waters_Meeting_-_geograph.org.uk_-_533745.jpg) and both were created by Adrian Moakes. 

Havn't been for a couple of years as last time I wandered that way it was in a very sorry state as seems nobody has bothered with it's upkeep and it looks like a rust bucket rather than a metal sculpture - rather typical of Manchester sadly. Half the maze had gone, someone had added some wooden posts who or why no idea but they are the sort you see used as fences in kids play areas and look bloody awful. Everything was adorned with graffiti -  not beautiful artistic work that takes hours and is a labour of love but rather a bunch of ugly pointless scrawled tags and obscenities. The waste bin that had been installed was overflowing, litter strewn across the ground, also in the grass and bushes which having also been neglected was an overgrown mess bording on jungle. I've not had the heart to go back since, perhaps I will one day now that the Stretford stretch of the canal has been cleared as they may have fixed this area up too.

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","I hated PE for years, thanks to the teachers. There were two reasons for this:

 * All but one of our PE teachers thought it would ""encourage"" us to do better if they rigged the teams by ability, so that games became predictable. If you were one of the poorer players, this acted as a disincentive to even make an effort - we were going to get trounced regardless of how well I played, so I might as well try to not get hurt. Had the teams been better balanced, it might have been worth making an effort (as it was playing games at Scouts, for example), as while I was pretty useless, what little I could do could turn out to be the difference between losing and winning (even if it was just briefly getting an opponent's attention).

 * I have an unusual eyesight defect, where one eye is 20/20 vision, and the other is badly short sighted. This means I have no depth perception at all - and as a consequence, cannot accurately locate a ball in free space. It's not a hand-eye coordination problem, as I have no problem if you confine the ball to a plane. However, the PE teachers refused (even in the face of letters from my GP) to see it as a medical condition - the only reason they could see that would explain why I couldn't catch a ball kicked in the air yet could catch a ball kicked along the ground was that I was lazy. Given that they were going to characterise me as lazy thanks to a medical condition, I might as well live up to their expectations, rather than try and do the best I could with the body I have.

With that said, in my final year of compulsory PE, I ended up with a good PE teacher, and finally understood why people might enjoy PE; he arranged things so that we couldn't predict the outcome of matches by looking at who was playing, and he understood that I was never going to do well at ball games, without letting that colour his attitude to me trying to (e.g.) run a race, or ride a bike around a course. I improved a lot in that last year - but the damage to my opinion of the subject as a whole had been done. If the change suggested means that more PE teachers are like the last one I had, that's likely to mean that my bad experience becomes something for the history books.",0,1335958198,null,0,false,0,c4j4lty,t3_t2ycr,t1_c4j4lty,t1_c4j4148,null,1428840088,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I sometimes wish that he'd find someone else in the US, where he lives, so that he could be happy and in love with someone and get to be with them. If and when that happens, I probably will kill myself. I don't feel angry or particularly emotional about it. It seems like it's the rational choice.

true,eudaimonist,uk,United Kingdom,"I will be voting no in my local referendum on this.

For some reason people think that more voting = more democracy, but democracy isn't about just voting. Otherwise there would be a referendum on everything; our democracy is about other things as well, balancing respect for individuals against the will of the majority.

Think about how many people voted in the last general election. Only 65.1% voted. Then we have European elections where 34.7% voted, local elections where 42.6% voted in England and, if in London, 44.6% voted. These are pretty low numbers. You can bet that far fewer cast an informed vote (i.e. choosing the right candidate with views they wish reflected in politics rather than just voting for the Party they like or voting as they have done for years).

Think about what you know about those people you already vote for - councillors, MPs, MEPs...probably not an awful lot.

The fact is, we're already suffering from voting fatigue. For each election we're expected to digest an overwhelming amount of information about each party's policy, each representative's past, experience and their own policy (which probably isn't precisely the same as the party they belong to).

Like elected police chiefs or a directly elected House of Lords, it's another layer of bureaucracy, giving those in the political class another potential job. It will do nothing but cost an excessive amount and make us all the more apathetic about politics.

There's a reason nobody has said exactly what these mayors would do or how they would transform your local area.

I suppose if you're happy with those you already vote for (or rather, are voted in, regardless of your personal vote!), think that they're the right people for the job then vote yes. Otherwise, what is the point of this?

tl;dr more voting always sounds like a good idea but you can have too much of a good thing",0,1335961456,null,0,false,0,c4j4xmt,t3_t31vv,t1_c4j4xmt,t3_t31vv,null,1428840223,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; What's a few hours on reddit in an evening when you've spent your whole day funneling money towards billionaire executives and shareholders who don't care if you live or die?

Have you considered giving it all up and following your dream, whatever it might be?  You could set up your own business and start funnelling money into your own pocket.  Or become a politician and try to change the system from the inside.  Maybe emigrate to the US to be with your fella, or go live in a hut in a forest if you think it'll make you happy.

I've always thought that if I ever got close enough to seriously contemplating suicide (which I haven't, thankfully) then I'd have nothing left to lose and might as well gamble the lot.

&gt; The more I see the real conditions of life, the more perspective I have, the less enjoyable life is. I'm not deluded nor selfish enough to enjoy it.

Agreed. I sometimes find myself wishing I was blissfully ignorant instead of being enlightened as to how the world really works.  But I took the red pill and I've seen how deep the rabbit hole goes.  I watch politicians prancing about on the news and see the whole shebang for the pantomime that it is.  I'm the boy who sees that the emperor wears no clothes when everyone around me appears to be oblivious.  But given the choice, would I go back and take the blue pill?  Probably not.  

I am reminded of another beautiful message, from the [Serenity Prayer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer): 

    Lord grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, 
    The courage to change the things I can, 
    And the wisdom to know the difference. 

Religious or not, the message is a good one.  

&gt; Thanks for taking the time out, though. It really means a lot.

You're welcome.  Best of luck on your journey.  I do hope you find what you're looking for.

Would have been nice to get final words that were sad but still left off on somewhat of a happy note, like Eccleston's. Instead they got all of the 10 fans very upset and probably contributed to some of the hate 11 received when he first appeared.

Other than that though I didn't really have a problem. A lot of things nowadays can probably trace their roots back to another story that's done something similar (Avatar anyone?). But if it still offers anything new I think it's worthy of being judged on its own merits (Hangover 2 on the other hand...).

Starting from Season 5 robs you of a lot of the nods from previous seasons that you will not understand at all. When the series started back up in 2005, it was made for a new demographic of fans who didn't know anything about the show. So the first season is very helpful in getting you up to speed and letting you get to know how the show will work.

A lot of fans, especially on this subreddit, seem to think Season 5 is a good place to start, simply because a whole new production crew and writing staff took over and it was basically a ""fresh start"" of New Who, but there are still plenty of mentions and references to past events that are somewhat essential to the story, so I highly highly recommend not skipping the first 4 seasons.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"Although there is definitely an anti-science slant within a lot of these protestors, the other thing they're protesting about (which the letter doesn't touch on) is the commercial implications of GM crops.

Obviously GM crops cost a lost of money to develop, and as such the companies funding it want to recoup that money - which means they need some [mechanism for controlling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_use_restriction_technology) those crops after they're purchased.

The idea that you would buy seed then be unable to use that seed to create new seed changes the relationship between supplier and farmer quite dramatically: you no longer own the plants you farm, you licence them.

Or perhaps you might be sued, or forced to destroy your crop, because seeds form your neighbour's GM field have ""contaminated"" yours (""contaminated"" in quotes since the plants are probably fine, it's just that you have committed patent infringement).

The same kind of intellectual property concepts that have been raised at online music/etc are now also being used against farmers.

Personally I have no problem eating GM food (we've been ""GM""ing our food and animals via selective breeding for at least 10,000 years), but I do have concerns about [patenting plants or animals](http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/monsanto-pig-patent-111/).

**Willian** is another winger who is rumored because AVB/Chelsea had contacted Shaktar about him and he (Willian) has said that he would love to play for Chelsea.

Spock's death  was a ""Kobiashi Maru"". He died to save the hundreds upon hundred onboard the Enterprise, he was meeting the needs of the many, and sacrificing the few (or the one).

Spock also did so by *knocking out* those who tried to stop them. He was absolutely determined to go into that chamber not to embrace death, but to save so many lives. His sole goal was to save everyone and escape an unwinnable scenario, the fact that he would have to die was merely an unfortunate side effect.

In the Doctor's case he died to save one person and one person only. And he did so with *extreme* reluctance. And even in saving Wilf, his focus was more on that this time had finally come for him, and that he would have to accept death.

Although there are many superficial parallels to the two instances (both dying from radiation behind glass) their differences are under *vastly* different circumstances.

Beyond the shallow similarities, these two death are *nothing* alike, both in how they occurred and how they were handled afterwards (there is no funeral for the Doctor).",0,1335971232,null,0,false,0,c4j6k7n,t3_t36za,t1_c4j6k7n,t3_t36za,null,1428840988,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","The disadvantage PE has as a subject is that it is compulsory to take, but does not end in a compulsory exam. This means that the school has to go to extra effort (which I suspect yours did) to catch incompetent PE teachers and either help them improve or get rid of them.

If the subject is examined, you can look at the trends in exam results - if a particular teacher's results are consistently poorer than their colleagues, you know you need to investigate. If the subject is optional, you can look at take up and drop out rates, and see if they correlate with a particular teacher. Note that these are all statistics the school gathers anyway; exam results for league tables, and take up and drop out rates for funding.

For PE, you need to somehow gauge what's happening in the lessons; while a school should do this anyway for all subjects, so that it can catch problems as early as possible, it's extra work that's easy to neglect (e.g. by having teachers self-report on problems and request extra training, rather than having a colleague monitor them), and that can feel quite insulting if done wrong (as you imply that the teachers being monitored are somehow defective, whereas you're actually just checking that they're not going wrong).

And to give the PE teachers a final blow, crap PE teachers don't massively affect any of the metrics the school gets rated on (league tables, OFSTED etc). It can therefore be hard to justify spending money on training for PE teachers, when you could spend that money on a subject that does affect your metrics.",0,1335971278,null,0,false,0,c4j6klt,t3_t2ycr,t1_c4j6klt,t1_c4j4q7r,null,1428840994,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I think if we make CL we hold onto Harry, because quite frankly i don't see another candidate that we could pull in at the moment who would be an noticeable step up. 

there is no way we can acquit Harry of the team's form from February on, squad rotation hurts, strategy hurts, constant rumors of him buggering off hurts, hear surgery hurts....all of these probably played some roll but honestly the team just didn't look interested in a number of the matches, that falls on Harry and he should be held accountable for it by fans and Levy.  However, disinterest can be corrected, if that can be corrected then hold onto Harry and see if he can put us back into CL.

Levy also deserves some blame, i actually like Levy and think he makes solid moves this season he has not been great. Parker was a good signing (sounds like it was driven by Harry) and Ade has for the most part been a good one.  Saha and Nelsen not as much.  

Look at Newcastle, Pardew is certainly on par with Harry in terms of managerial skill from what i can see and going into the season he seemed to have less talent.  However Newcastle had alot more hits on their signings than we did.
Newcastle brought in 
Ba (Free)
Cabaye (5mil)
Cisse (10mil) 
Santon (5mil) 
Obertan (3mil) 
Marveaux (Free)

So Newcastle paid 15 mil for Ba, Cisse and Cabaye who have been great signings for them. Both Ba and Cisse were players that Spurs reportedly looked at and did nothing about despite both clearly being the type of player that could have reinforced the strikers that everyone has been saying we need to address for 2 years.  This situation falls on Levy not making the move that everyone knows needs to be done.

&gt;**I still hate Germans: Patrick Moore attacks nation 70 years after Nazi bomb killed his fiancée.**  

&gt;Eccentric astronomer told interviewer: 'The only good Kraut is a dead Kraut'

&gt;Nearly seven decades have passed since Sir Patrick Moore’s fiancée was killed by a Nazi bomb.

&gt;But the passage of time has clearly done little to quell the eccentric astronomer’s deep-seated feelings towards Germans.

&gt;‘The only good Kraut is a dead Kraut,’ the 89-year-old has declared in an interview to mark the 55th anniversary of his star-gazing TV show The Sky At Night.

&gt;The comment, apparently delivered with the utmost seriousness, may seem shocking to younger generations but the scars run deep for Sir Patrick.

&gt;His fiancée Lorna, a nurse, and he were both 20 when she died in an air raid on London in 1943, three years after they met.

&gt;Sir Patrick, who served with the RAF during the war, has previously told how he was so deeply in love that he entered into a life of bachelorhood after the tragedy as ‘there was no question of anyone else’.

&gt;In his interview for the latest edition of Radio Times magazine, on sale today, he suggests that Germany still thirsts for world domination, saying: ‘We must take care. There may be another war. The Germans will try again, given another chance. A Kraut is a Kraut is a Kraut. And the only good Kraut is a dead Kraut.

&gt;‘A German general said to me at the end of the war, “You won two wars. You won’t win the third. And that’s the economic war.” I hope he’s wrong.’

&gt;He admitted there ‘can be good, free, honourable, decent Germans’ only to add: ‘I haven’t met them myself, but I’m sure they exist.’

&gt;He continued: ‘I’m no European. Why? Go to Europe and look around. The Germans tried to conquer us. The French betrayed us. The Belgians did very little and the Italians made us our ice cream.

&gt;‘Just look at the world now and look at it when we had a bigger say in it. The English are best. Stand up for England!’

&gt;Monocle-wearing Sir Patrick, who began presenting The Sky At Night in 1957 – said he had had ‘a rather interesting war’.

&gt;‘Reliable rumours’ of his derring-do include how as a Flight Lieutenant he once climbed over the dead bodies of his pilot and co-pilot to land his Lancaster bomber safely. Then there is talk of a distinguished career in intelligence.

&gt;He confessed that he ‘fiddled’ his way into the RAF on the outbreak of war by lying about his age – he was 16 at the time, a year younger than the minimum for air crew volunteers with parental consent – and hiding a childhood heart problem.",0,1335973095,null,0,false,0,c4j6z44,t3_t3983,t1_c4j6z44,t1_c4j67s5,null,1428841185,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Remember in the Fires of Pompeii, Donna tried it out and it came out in another language. In my opinion since she wanted to see what happened when the native language is spoken it translated it to a different language.
 
I have come to the understanding that the Tardis has a nice sized range for the translation device. Also that the Tardis gives those who enter the Tardis the long range perks and when a person hasn't it at the very least has a small range translation capabilities as shown in the christmas invasion.

Another thing to take not of is the tendency to leave some languages untranslated when the Doctor doesn't have a companion or at least an official one. One of the initial thoughts I had about the Judoon, but then later I think that species can ask not to be translatable by the Tardis and you have to learn their language.

true,hireddithowareyou,lfcflame,,"Ok, considering we're on r/LiverpoolFC, I can be somewhat honest and say things I can't often say in the presence of others - I agree with Kenny that the FA Cup was by far more important than salvaging our position in the League.

If we win the FA Cup this year, it would go down in my book as one of our most famous doubles ever - but if we lose, I will be very, very, very depressed. Forget about the fact it is Kenny's first full season back, forget about the fact Carragher, Kuyt and Maxi (I rate him high enough that this matters to me) may never play for us again after this year, forget about the fact Suarez's first full season was marred by *that* ridiculous situation, the performance this year has been woefully inconsistent - especially at home - and that is what hurts the most.

There were some positives for sure (FM pep-talk anyone?), but a 5th place finish will do nothing to make me feel better about the way the squad performed in a number of league games this year, especially in the second half of the season. Losing the FA Cup will make it that much worse of a feeling of despair and confusion to me, but if we take the Carling Cup and FA Cup, we will all have something to hang our hats on when we're arguing with mates about the results this year and then we can truthfully put our full focus into the league next year. If we lose, and we lose to trophy-seeking Torres of all people, then the Carling Cup will look even more worthless than most argue it already is.

The domestic trophies are a stepping stone to greatness, regardless of their international stature. Winning a trophy is what you play for, not a CL spot or Europa league spot, or even an extra million or two for being a better mid-table club than the other mid-table clubs. A trophy is what a player should want and the fans should want. No one remembers a Carling Cup winner that came in 5th, but you can bet your house they will remember teams that win more than one trophy, especially when they played like we did this year.

None of this is with the club's best interests in mind (financially, getting top players, etc.), this is just for me, as a Liverpool fan no longer living in Merseyside, surrounded by a bunch of glory hunting twats that will never let me forget the fact we haven't been a regular title challenging squad in far too long. I just want to be able to say ""even after all the shite you spewed about your squad, you still don't have a single trophy while we have two."" English footballing reputation be damned when it comes to the CL, I just can't wish any sort of success for Chelsea this year. Also, I want more than anything for City to pip United so they can't get number 20 while we're in this position.

**God, please, all I ask is that you give us the Carling Cup and the FA Cup, give Man Shitty the League, and give Bayern ol' Big Ears.

For example, it has taken Parliament nearly a decade to arrive at the conclusion that Murdoch is a cunt.

We know that. We've known for years. Westminster is still in 1997, whilst the internet is debating 2027.

The pace at which Westminster moves, coupled with its internal structure, the careering that goes on, the lobbying, the disconnect from reality, the ineffectiveness, the incompetence, the bickering, the misogyny, the lies, the corruption, the special interests - all of it adds up to an old beast in need of a dart to the neck, a strock of the back, and a gentle reassurance that everything will be OK. 

""Shh...Shh...Shh... all better now, we will take care of things now, shh....shh... that's right just close your eyes....shh...just go to sleep""

Party politics was designed for a time when MPs had to travel for up to a week to get to Westminster to tell the national government there was a plague or a drought or a fire or a revolution happening. It's an old, out dated, ineffective system, and not only that it has been hijacked.

The conversation you and I are having right now, which has no doubt been read by countless casual observers, is an order of magnitude more effective than a building which hosts daily political duels which have descended to the most cynical, vacuous and needlessly confrontational nonsense orgy ever seen in the history of man. Their only purpose is to score a soundbyte, a headline, or a political notch on rickety political bedpost.

Some of the players we've been linked with (Gotze, Hazard, et al) are fantastic, but we will have to end up paying over the odds for them. I'd prefer it if we didn't have to spend £30m on a player.

Fellaini could be interesting, he could play over Mikel/Essien if we play a 4-3-2-1 with a DM and 2 DM, 2 wingers and lone striker. But I think we're a bit oversubscribed in the midfield department at the moment, unless we offload some players: off the top of my head in a D/CM role we have Romeu, Mikel, Essien, Meireles, Lampard, and Ramires/Mata can play there as well if required - not to mention McEachran when he comes back from Swansea.

I really don't follow other leagues as well as I should to know who we should be on the lookout for, beyond what positions we could do with strengthening.

I think really I'd prefer it if we brought in some of the youth we have out on loan and give them a shot in the first team (Kevin de Bruyne and Lucas Piazon I'm really excited to see what they can do in the PL, I mean they did cost us about £7m each IIRC).",0,1335978748,null,0,false,0,c4j89h0,t3_t3a6q,t1_c4j89h0,t3_t3a6q,null,1428841857,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

While the club might not have any 'real' debt because the debt is to Roman and he owns the club, we post huge losses every year. If we continue posting huge losses, then we hypothetically could lose out on European football. making the group stages is 40 million pounds into our coffers. Losing CL would be a huge blow to us. 

One way to increase our chances of breaking even is to build a new, larger, more modern (more corporate hospitality... maybe host a CL final or two) stadium because stadium development doesn't count towards FFP I believe.

Instead of waving goodbye like they want you to, take action!

First off, SHARE this status!
Then: switch ISP, put pressure on the legislators, join a pirate party, start your own tracker, arrange a (peaceful, yet angry) demonstration outside MPAA/BPI/MAFIAA, set up a proxy, get an ipredator account, get mad or all of the above.

Also, circumventing these ridiculous blocks is easy:

true,[deleted],null,null,"While it may not be an ideal situation, why should the fact that Scotland has a bigger neighbour which has decided to charge it's own students a fortune for University stop it from using its budget to provide free education to people from Scotland?  Because that's what would happen if English students were also held to have to have their fees paid - the Scottish government couldn't afford to pay for the tens of thousands that would come up to take advantage of the fact and they would have to scrap the policy, meaning that *everyone* had to pay. That can hardly be the situation that anyone wants.  Even if by some miracle they could afford to pay, it would result in far fewer Scottish students, who the policy is aimed at, being able to get University places in Scotland, as the number of English students who would wish to take advantage of it far outnumbers the Scots - they're simply bigger.  

It's just a quirk of EU law that makes this controversial, and while the Scottish government have tried to challenge having to pay for EU students I doubt they'll be successful.  The end result may be that the rest of the UK is discriminated against, which is unfortunate, but the Scottish government is using *its budget* to pursue a fairly laudable goal, I don't see what is ludicrous about it at all.

true,crimsontide091,eccleston,Eccleston,"We know that the TARDIS is alive and telepathic, the Doctor says this on multiple occasions and we see her in S6.

For your first question: The Doctor wishes to say the word ""Allons-y"" as it is, so the TARDIS does not translate the word. Also, because he is intentionally speaking that language, it doesn't translate. Same for when Donna tried speaking Latin in Pompeii, but because it was being translated, it came out wrong.

Second question: The Doctor is connected to the TARDIS in a way, we see his great pain when we almost lose the TARDIS in Journey's End, he feels both emotional and physical anguish. His mental connection to her is also the strongest since he has been with her for 700 years. Other companions who have not been in the TARDIS as long or have left will cease to have the translating ability. Sarah Jane, for example, would likely not be able to translate other languages after the 4th Doctor left her.

Since the TARDIS is telepathic and connected to the Doctor, they jointly have the translator work for whoever needs it.

Take nothing away from Cisse's goals though.. both spectacular! And at least it reflects better on us to have 2 goals go against us that were arguably unstoppable

What I thought was interesting though was how much the '2 up front' approach of Newcastle dominated us in the first half, and how by comparison our one up front was severely uninspiring, and then when we brought Drogba on as a 2nd attacker how much more dangerous we looked.

* Monsanto is not the only biotech company in the world. If you think they are the only ones who engineer GMOs then you have the brain of an elephants arse

* Monsanto have shitty business practices, but the internet is full of BS articles about them, 90% of what is said is made up by the anti-GMO and people hard of thinking. 

* There are plenty of legitimate, responsible biotech companies that are focussing their research on alternatives to the intensively farmed crops we have now. 

* GMO is not just about profit, 90% of the research starts as publicly funded. Grants pay for most of it, it is only when it is published do the bigger biotech companies get involved. It would be easier to profit by generating strains of crop that need more and more intensive farming, and sell lots of fertilizers, insecticides etc etc. GMO, like any research is a open pit that swallows up a lot of money before it puts anything back out. 

* Greenpeace are no longer concerned about environmental issues, I stopped supporting them when they became a political pressure group. Their practises are **exactly** what they accuse Monsanto of, they paid one of their 'advisors' to publish a paper in a non-journal claiming all sorts of problems with the corn borer. The methodology in the paper was poor at best, and ignored other important factors, and was twisted to fit their view. Of course Greenpeace did not let it be known that it was a funded project by them.... 

* Gene patenting sounds alarming but in fact is isn't. Patents are being sought for **recombinant** genes, genes that simply do not exist, in their present form, in the biological world. That is NOT to say they are artificial, they are a **combination** of genes, hence the word recombinant. Also a small point to remember is we share 70% of our DNA with a lettuce, why? Because we share genes for growth, metabolism, and homeostasis, all eukaryotes do. So when you hear of scientists putting a gene from this into that, it really is akin to putting a carburettor from one car into another to improve its performance. 

Source? I work on *Bacillus thuringiensis*. If you want proper sources have a look on pubmed.

Another thing, when playing without Mata, if we concede (and almost inevitably, we always do) the whole team loses confidence and starts to droop. Looks like we can dish it out but we can't really take it - especially when Mata isn't starting. He is clearly the pivot around which we need to build our team in the summer. 

Starting Torres without Mata is a mistake. Bringing on Drogba without Lamps is a mistake. Thankfully, Drogs had to play only about 5 min before Lamps came on but, by then, it was too little, too late. 

Full credit to Cissé for two brilliant strikes. The fist was clinical, the second was simply amazing. Makes me wonder why our scouts can't pick out such talent? He is a perfect example of the fact that good talent doesn't always need to be expensive! 

I wonder if our scouts realize that we need to find a player that fits our system rather than buy players and devise a system to play to their strengths all the time - that is merely patchworking our tactics.

If that happens, we'll get fucked by FFP - which (potentially) means no CL until we get our finances in order. I'm not sure any player would want to come to a team that might end up not being able to play the CL. 

I'd rather see us buying ten players at 8-10 mn each on lower salaries, than buy these five 'stalwarts' and pay enormous salaries. This, assuming we manage to offload Bos, Kalou, Malouda, Yossi and Meireles in the summer. Drogs, JT and Lampard need to start accepting squad roles eventually. If we have to, I'd also be okay with selling Essien and Sturridge but only for a bomb, nothing less. 

One of the problems with buying foreign players is that you can have only 17 players in the squad that are not home-grown. It gets worse with UEFA, where four players must compulsorily have trained at the CFC academy between 15 and 21. We currently have only ONE - JT. 

Plus, each of the players mentioned have a different style of play, where as we aren't even sure of our own style when we are playing. With Torres and Mata, we prefer possession football. With Drogs and Lamps, we prefer the long-ball counter-attacks. Hazard and Hulk fit the former, while Götze fits the latter.

Sure, 4th place required Tottenham slipping up, and in the form they've been in that's hardly unlikely. Yes, it's a gamble, but I can't see how it isn't worth it.

I'm not claiming we should be holding a better position. It's been a hugely frustrating season. 4th place would indicate something was salvaged.

I've already said in this thread that the FA Cup, in and of itself is a great achievement but I'm trying to think beyond that.

This summer, it's blazing apparent that we're going to see the big teams all re-investing to (re)assert their positions. An FA cup won't help us compete with that.

It's obvious that reinvestment is necessary in the squad and the champion's league revenue will make that possible but without it, where is the money going to come from? FFP is going to bite hard and a smaller revenue is going to hurt. A lot.

I said below that I will happily eat my words if we pull it off in Munich. The Champion's League would be extraordinary, and render 4th redundant.

Is it so much to ask to hedge bets a little?

The general consensus amongst the indie game community seems to be that preventing piracy doesn't actually help sales because the pirates are typically either not going to buy it anyway or will buy it after they've tried a pirate version and the music industry, for all their complaining about lost sales from piracy, is doing great.

It's not hard to imagine how piracy could even help sales: If the number of pirates is large and the percentage of them who would have bought the product anyway is small then there's very little opportunity cost, and by increasing the number of people who use the product you're increasing the number of people who have heard of it (and the frequency with which they hear about it) and thus are likelihood that they'll pay for it.

I think there are two likely scenarios:

1) MI6 ordered his death (who knows why) and for whatever reason didn't/couldn't just make him disappear quietly.

2) Somebody else killed him. Something about the crime is inextricably linked with something MI6 want kept secret, so they alter the crime scene.

Nonetheless, allow me to explain why I felt that tonight's midfield was second-string. Sans sarcasm. 

Mikel is good as def mid but he tends to linger with the ball. Usually, Lamps immediately takes over and releases Rami. Meireles is no Lamps, to be honest. Rami on the left flank was wasted for the whole of the first half and Sturridge on the right was, well, Sturridge on the right. Malouda is a decent midfield passer but he looked even more lost than Meireles tonight. This midfield as a trio was completely mismatched interest of abilities, skill, talent and positioning. 

Wanna know why? Because Mata. Mata is the midfield magician who brings the midfield together. He is the one who receives the ball all over the pitch and creates spaces for the others. Without him, Malouda kept sending the ball to the short flank and Rami kept getting wrestled off it. With Mata, he would have provided that extra second or two which is vital for Rami to bomb forward. 

Starting important games is not THE ultimate measure of success. I appreciate discussions but I do not appreciate snarky sarcasm and I'll thank you to remember it, please. ",0,1335998758,null,0,false,0,c4jd1mh,t3_t3sej,t1_c4jd1mh,t1_c4jcl3c,null,1428844110,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3
