I tried doing this crap in middle/eary-high school with Kingdom Hearts and The Nightmare Before Christmas. Entertainment that isnt as ""deep"" as you play it up to be can lead to self discovery, but that part is really awesome. It doesnt matter if the material you derived that from is stupid, because you grew from it and you see yourself as a better person. I get that.


 However, glorifying the cause (especially when its as insignificant as this show) of your self-discovery and moral enlightenment is complete nonsense and makes me cringe. Its just a good show. Outside stimuli. Nothing to get fixated over to the point that youre writing poetry about it. Just enjoy it and dont get so attached.

According to that you're welcome to stay here for 12 months because your girlfriend probably counts as an ""Academic"" visitor.

Take a look at both those links and think about if you are going to come visit, talking to a british embassy if you can find one.

We have special relations with America that might make it easier for you to apply for a working visa if you can find a job here before you move.

Also Sparkbrook isn't that bad, it's just a bit muslim-racist, as in, the Muslims really don't like anyone who isn't Muslim around that area, there are a few areas like that, doesn't mean she's in danger, just means she shouldn't really go around them after dark, same goes for most places in the world though.

Living here, I really hate this city, it's filled to the brim with bad accents and chavs, at least in the areas I've lived in, it's a decent place if you know the right places but it's still chav central, I live in a decent area now and so the city isn't as bad as I thought it was but I'm just glad I never got the accent.

As for work, honestly there's a lot of construction jobs, there always will be because we're constantly tearing and rebuilding crap, you may have to move to a different city but if you want to be with her that badly then having to get a train to go see her or driving down/up to her wouldn't be as bad as not even being in the same country, the hardest bit would be finding a company who will sponsor and not just be lazy and go ""eh we'll just find someone local""",0,1349496708,null,0,false,0,c6ictuz,t3_10f4lu,t1_c6ictuz,t3_10f4lu,null,1430076656,2,false,brum,t5_2rdjk,2

true,elbruce,wardr,Hurt,"Doctor Who *never* cared about canonical-physics continuity.  Consider the 10th Doctor constantly stating that multiple parallel universes can never interact, even when they do repeatedly in front of his face.  ""Fixed points in time"" is also bullshit, as Rose changes her own reality (consequence: it causes dragon-like creatures to attack - not the same thing as ""impossible"").  The TARDIS has to be a blue police box, [except for when it doesn't](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owJ5ookO9wA).  Everything ""has to _____ except for when it doesn't.""  

That's the entire point of TheShader's [comment above](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/10yy05/this_seems_like_good_advice_for_anyone_who_doesnt/c6hvy74); science fantasy (including Doctor Who) is story first, physics second.  Hard science fiction is physics first, story second.  Much of science fiction falls between these two approaches.

The physics should follow the story; the story should try to generally stay in the physics, but if it makes a better story to violate the physics, then they'll go right ahead.  We know that ""the Doctor lies,"" and anything else may be yet to be explained.

As viewers, we should have sufficient humility to *not* assume that we are experts on how the Angels work.  All we know is what we've seen before, in other episodes.  And even then, we've only seen what glimpses and aspects of them as *that* story needed us to see.  The fact is, we don't actually know very much about the Weeping Angels.  And demanding that the Angels behave according to our prior understanding of them only exposes how little we can claim to actually know about them.

Regarding the ""lvl. 70 multiclass Nitpickers/Neckbeards"" business, that's the only way I can describe people who would judge a story as badly written solely because it didn't match their personal claim of trivia mastery.  We are *not* in a position of knowing everything about the Angels, and are thus *not* in a position to judge them as having violated our ""absolutely true"" preconceptions.  If you didn't have those preconceptions, would it be a good story?  That's the only way to judge any story.

**PS:** That said, what I would have like to have seen in the TATM episode is an explanation on why the Angels were so shit-hot to chase Rory down at the expense of everyone else.  I mean, he was clearly their target.  And a canonical answer for this they could have used: with 2000+ years of existence (from his personal perspective), he's carrying more time energy than even the Doctor (who I believe clocks in as about 1200 years currently) making him the biggest ""feast"" they've ever seen.

true,Yeats,null,null,"Thank you. Whether or not she does come back is irrelevant. I agree that the writing has been extremely inconsistent. Yes the doctors ""death"" wasn't actually his death. But Until that episode he HAD to die. The writers changed the story and used our lack of information (as an audience) to justify the switch. We saw the doctor die that time. This time we didn't even see them die. I do not believe that there is anything in the shows logic that prevents them from having other adventures or meeting up with other people or there being some other fake or switch. Doctor who is notorious for a god in the machine style of solutions. I don't see why another sudden twist of logic can't be applied to justify the return or revisit of the ponds. Rose was allowed to come back even though she absolutely couldn't. The doctor didn't die even though every record said he absolutely had to. Further he saw his personal timeline- which turned out to be false. 

You say there are fixed points but I don't believe there are. The only reason the doctor didn't die is because at the last second he worked out a fix with the machine. What if he hadn't? Would he have died and then you'd say the moment /was/ his death after all. Or would he have been unable to not ask for that favor? how is that possible? Remember when the 10th doctor saved the people on mars. That was also a fixed point. But we found out later that their deaths aren't really important. The future is fixed. The brave sacrifice was replaced by a suicide and the future stayed the same. So in my round about way I feel like Amy and rory don't need to die in the past because of some paradox bs. Because so many times have we squeezed out of that. Amy and rory need to die in the past because they /choose/ to die in the past. Just like the captain /choose/ to kill herself to keep the future the way it has to be. To not let the doctor or anyone else decide for her. Amy and rory have been pulling back from life with the doctor. I see this as their acceptance of each other and their place in life as mortals- not some Devine time lock paradox that forces them.

We have our little block of ex 80's rowdy boys who are still pretty thuggish (block 81a for anyone who wants a heads up on avoiding sitting with them), but their numbers are few and dwindling. and although they seem to spend more time abusing the opposing fans and team than cheering us on, I've never heard them being racist.

I should probably qualify this by saying I've never been to an away match though so can't comment on what we get up to in other people's stadiums.

---

On the receiving end, away teams fans that I've personally heard giving us the gas chamber hiss are West ham and Leeds fans. And away team fans I've personally heard doing monkey chants were Seville fans.

Edit. Forgot about the two guys who were arrested and given a life ban for racially abusing Sol Campbell. A lot of Spurs fans do tend to lose their heads when it comes him, but it's all judas chants rather than racial abuse. As far as I could tell by the chat around north London in the weeks after the event, the two with the life bans were condemned by everyone else.

The correct form is indicate where you are going to, when there make two very quick (by using the indicator stalk to almost put the indicators on fully) flashes to the opposite direction followed by two of the same in the direction you were moving to.

So if you were overtaking left hand lane to middle lane it would look like...

Right---Right---Right &lt;get to middle lane&gt; Left-Left-right-right.

It takes a little while to get it right (in a car you have to get the stalk almost to the point where the indicator clicks in without it actually going on) once you do get it right it's a pretty good thing to have. 

I see some people put the Hazards on as a thank-you, for me that's a bit confusing - it could mean that I've not dipped my headlights or there's something wrong with my car, or there's something wrong with their car.

Car drivers also have the benefit of the left hand raised underneath the rear-view mirror, which is also good, but if you've got a van or the RVM is blocked by a trailer it can't be seen by the motorist behind.

&gt;Conclusion: this was a dormant account that got switched on 3 months ago

Wrong. Every single one of those three submissions are more than three months old for example. So is [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/esk6n/duplocraft_anyone_sorry_for_the_bad_shop/c1alogg). In fact, at least the first submission pre-dates Assange's circus. What happened here is that you hit a limitation in Reddit's history keeping, and instead of questioning why a person that has submissions more than seven months older than his first post, you just make a lot of assumptions. That's pretty telling about your personality.

&gt;that now consistently shills against Assange and Wikileaks. (Do note a shill doesn't have to be paid, but I haven't ruled it out in your case.)

No, they don't have to be paid, but they have to work for an organisation or group which they don't acknowledge they work for. So who am I working for/with? You're not the first *account* to suggest that I'm getting paid. It seems like a rather extreme and somewhat unwarranted thing to say. I think it is much more likely that your account, along with others who operate in an almost identical manner,  are sockpuppet accounts.

The simple truth is, and I know this must sound boring compared to the world you've created in your mind, that I'm just interested in the case. Actually, I'm not that interested in the case, but in the circus around it. I'm interested in the cult and the people who spread the lies, despite being shut down again and again. The people who suddenly, or perhaps never, had any notion of source criticism. Who gladly parrot the most biased sources and expect that posting a questionable link would somehow win them the argument. I'm interested in people such as yourself, who are acting like shills for Assange's defence team, and who never argue, just attack the credibility of their opponent by suggesting that being interested in a subject makes you a paid shill, while it in reality probably just means that you're way better informed.

The dream of unlimited movement through time and space is a theme
that emerges repeatedly in Healy and Cordeiro's works. Sameday 
Service or Sooner is a humorous take on Dotor Who's fictional
time machine the TARDIS. The police telephone box appeared in the
popular British TV series and enabled the science fiction 
character to travel anywhere in the universe within any time
period. In the sculpture, the distinctive blue telephone box is
dismantled, its parts are bound together and leant against a wall
as though ready for shipping. The absurdity of flat-packing this
fantastical transportation device - and thus destroying its 
powers of mobility - is characteristic of the artists' playful
approach to form and function in their practice. The artists
describe the work as:

Both Jewish and non-Jewish fans of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. adopted ""Yid"" (or ""Yiddo"") as a nickname and ""Yiddo, Yiddo!"" as a battle cry and often identify themselves as ""Yid Army"". While such usage remains controversial, for the overwhelming majority of Tottenham supporters, it is used with pride.[3] Some Jewish Tottenham supporters use it with a political consciousness of the club as a bastion against racism and antisemitism. Others use it simply because many of the fans and owners of the club are Jews. However, the name was first given to the supporters as an insult, due to the large Jewish following at the club. This following started in the 1890s and 1900s when the club was the team of choice for ""East-enders"" - including large numbers of Jewish immigrants - who could easily get cheap buses and trams to Tottenham, heading north along the road later designated the A10. East-end Jews have mostly moved to the north and east London suburbs and Herts and Essex, but support for Tottenham Hotspur continues to run in families (a famous example is Alan Sugar). For visiting teams' supporters the Jewish connection continues to be bolstered by the large numbers of - easily identifiable - Hassidic Orthodox Jews living in South Tottenham and Stamford Hill; but in practice there is no evidence of Hassidic Jews attending soccer matches.",0,1349516373,null,0,false,0,c6iff1d,t3_11138e,t1_c6iff1d,t1_c6ifaux,null,1430077866,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

true,gloomypancake,null,null,"Right, since I've been energised by coffee this morning, here is my full take on it. 

The annoyance experienced by people wasn't at the suicide, but rather at the lack of action and the indecisiveness on the guy's part. If he had gone ahead and jumped without any furore, the reaction would've been different. If he had jumped *after* all the hullabaloo with the deliberating, the reaction would've been akin to relief - 1. because he finally took some form of action and released everyone from the state of anticipation, and 2. because hey, show's over, everyone get on with your day. 

Maybe this guy had a really bad day or week at work and thought ""I'll show them. I'll make them feel sorry for how they treated me."" without actually having the intent to commit suicide because maybe he has a young family at home or other responsibilities that suddenly came to mind as he was standing on the bridge. Durkheim wrote a book examining suicide from a sociological perspective and essentially states that suicide is a reaction to the anomie felt by people within the capitalist state. When your blood oils the machine and you get nothing in return, you think ""fuck 'em, I'm done"" and go suicide in an attempt to protest against this as well as try and disrupt the machine. 

Psychologically speaking, there are many safeguards against suicide and these safeguards are practically non-existent in the suicidally depressed, which is why those that really want to die, do. The planning and deliberation that goes on once someone decides they will die is terrifying. However I've heard it said that this sort of deliberation actually helps with depression because hey, suddenly there is a way out! They start planning for the only good thing in their foreseeable future and it helps it lift their mood. Families will often say they never saw it coming, s/he seemed happy. When there is a light at the end of the tunnel then why not feel happy? 

I can imagine the conversations people who were held up last night had with friends and family: ""Sorry I'm late home, some twat on North Bridge couldn't decide of he wanted to die. Attention-seeking bastard.""  
Compare to if the guy had actually jumped: ""Sorry I'm late, someone jumped off North Bridge.""  
Both no doubt sparked conversation among people (much like here) and to me, that is a good thing. Suicide and the preceding mental health issues are still a massive stigma in our society which is why, arguably, the guy did not seek out help through the proper channels. A lot of people experiencing mental health issues don't feel they are *that* bad, they often feel 'fake' and that they don't *deserve* real help, because hey, its not that bad surely. Other people have it much worse and they're fine. 

Anyway, what I'm trying to get at is that it was the lack of action either way that produced this feeling of annoyance in people. Its a reaction to indecisiveness, cf. the what shall we eat for dinner tonight? argument. Or closer to home, what pub shall we meet at?  
The egging him on part I can't satisfactorily answer; I'm not fully informed of this behaviour. My own theory is that it may be a sort of *l'appel du vide* by proxy, or alternatively it may be a showing of bravado to one's friends along the lines of 'look at me, I'm not scared of death'. 

And like I've already said, those that want to die, will. As a society, to prevent the events like the ones of last last night from re-occuring, we need to stop stigmatising mental health issues, need to increase awareness and increase access and knowledge about resources.

You liked a bit of LoM &amp; A2A - you might enjoy seeing Philip Glenister in [Hidden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_(TV_series\)) (a three part miniseries). IMDB rates it at only a 6.1, but I really enjoyed it.

For more crime drama, check out the miniseries [Good Cop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Cop_(TV_series\)) - rather fast paced and pretty brutal (final episode not yet broadcast due to the murder of a real world police officer) - or [Inspector George Gently](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_George_Gently), set in the 1960s in the North East (Newcastle/Durham) and I star as an extra... For George Gently I think there are around five series, with around four episodes each, but each episode is an hour and a half, so more like a set of films. Finally if you want **even more** crime drama, [Waking the Dead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking_the_Dead_(TV_series\)) is probably a good bet. I've only watched the most recent series (9) and absolutely loved it. I can't vouch for the earlier series, but I'm going to give them a try.

If you want a little more period drama, I thought [Parade's End](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade's_End_(TV_series\)) was rather good - shouldn't be hard for you to get as it was co-produced by some american company IIRC.

I can't really think of anything like Doc Martin - I've watched the most recent series and should get around to the older stuff at some point. I live in Cornwall too, so it's nice to see somewhere local. My parents, who watch Doc Martin, also seem to enjoy [New Tricks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Tricks_(TV_series\)) - I've not watched it, but it seems a friendly comedy so may appeal to the same sort of viewer who watches DM.

Now to break away from crime related TV...

You need to at least try [The Inbetweeners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inbetweeners) (a hilariously awkward comedy with 16/17/18 year olds at school) which also spawned a [film](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inbetweeners_Movie). Very *very* puerile, with copious swearing and incredibly popular.

Also worth checking out is [Fresh Meat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_Meat_(TV_series\)) - this stars university students, is also a hilariously awkward comedy and has a high re-watch value. Give it a try.

Finally the sketch shows [The Armstrong and Miller Show](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Armstrong_and_Miller_Show) and [That Mitchell and Webb Look](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Mitchell_and_Webb_Look) (yes, those are the two guys from Peep Show) are good, and you should be able to find a few clips on youtube.",0,1349516836,null,0,false,0,c6ifgeh,t3_11174x,t1_c6ifgeh,t3_11174x,null,1430077885,3,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,3

Sure, you can *try* to create a consistent system out of what you've learned through watching the show, but it'll always be incomplete, and it will always be subject to destruction by the needs of the writers at any given moment.  That's how it's always been, and that'd how it still is.

As for the Statue of Liberty, it was only recently Angelized before those events, and only for a few minutes until those events were resolved.  Then (almost) all Angels were destroyed by Amy/Rory timeline suicide.  There's your answer.  Does that make you feel better?

That's all it takes to ""explain"" the image of the Statue of Liberty turning into a giant threatening monster for horror effect.  IMO, the effect is more important than your trivial demand for explanation.

**PS**: I hear from too many claimed ""Whovians"" that they ""hate"" an important part of the show, such as a Doctor or companion.  Like it or hate it, love certain parts or get through others, but you can't claim to love the show and also hate an important part of it like a companion or Doctor.  If you hate something about the show so much that it makes you turn to the Internet to complain about it, the **you hate the show** and should not watch it.

Because I point out that you are wrong and give an explanation? Yeah, that's not at all childish of you. 

&gt;Here's some advice, if you've been found out you should retire this account and come back with something more convincing having learned from the experience.

Found out? I'm afraid I won't give up my account just because a few individuals can't tell the difference between someone with an alternative opinion, and a shill. I obviously have no problem with being convincing since you have yet to argue against any of my point, leaving me to believe that you accept that you are wrong.

&gt;It's nice to know that you think of your reddit comment history as ""trash"" and I would agree, however, I'm literally someone who has just done a minor word frequency investigation into your history over the last three months

I know what you did, and I at least suspect I know why you did it. It's because you can do no better than attacking the messenger because the message is unpleasant. That is you can't argue the points so you you resort to ad hominems. On reddit that often means looking through peoples histories and suggesting that interest equals shilling. Yeah, it doesn't make any sense to me either.

&gt;which is all that reddit would send back.

That's some impressing backpaddling. Your entire post was building up to the point where you triumphantly concluded that my account was a sleeper account. Now that you grudgingly admit (though not publicly) that that was wrong and that it was based on sloppy legwork on your part, you simply downplay it. Again, very mature of you.

&gt;False. You are just interested in steering the comments towards an anti-Assange bias.

False, I'm interested in correcting the lies and dispel the kind of lazy arguments people such as yourself are using in lieu of actual arguments backed up by evidence.

Only at birth does the baby ""gain"" the rights.

Thus - the argument is that you are interfering with an individual's choice.

The improvement in neonatal care - is more relevant for situations where there is a premature delivery - for whatever reason.  It more segues into the argument over at what point do we not attempt resus and intensive treatment?

But as medical care and technology improves, the abortion limit should naturally shrink to represent that. And as that care increases, there are more methods of more effective contraception to prevent pregnancy in the first place too, and more effective methods of detecting pregnancy.

- It kills between 10-40% of people infected.
- It is rare - but incidence has risen over the past decade.
- It is present in more than 30 countries in Eurasia and Africa, including northwestern China, central Asia, southern and eastern Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.
- Initial symptoms include headache, high fever, back pain, joint pain, stomach pain and vomiting. Rarer signs include jaundice, severe bruising and uncontrolled bleeding.
- An anti-viral drug called ribavirin is the most common treatment. There is no safe vaccine.
- It was first described in the Crimea in 1944 and was found to be responsible for an illness in a human in Congo in 1956.

Here the rule of thumb is that you must stay in the left-most lane of a multi-lane road unless you are overtaking slower traffic - but that's not precisely what's instructed by the road rule legislation.

Here in Australia there's so many misconceptions about the rule, and it's not helped by the fact that the road signs don't actually instruct what the legislation enforces.

In Australia, the rule is (to paraphrase because I couldn't be arsed looking it up and quoting exactly)....

&gt;A driver must not travel in the right-hand lane of a multi-lane road, where a speed limit of more than 80 km/h is in effect, or a 'Keep Left Unless Overtaking' sign is in effect.

This means that you may lawfully travel in the middle lane (if there are 3 or more lanes) of a multi-lane road at any speed (unless you are unreasonably obstructing traffic), whether or not you are overtaking another vehicle, and despite the sign telling you to 'keep left'.",0,1349526288,null,0,false,0,c6ig72k,t3_110ou8,t1_c6ig72k,t3_110ou8,null,1430078241,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

One day there was a knock at the door from a TV licensing inspector, the guy was all cocky smiles because he thought he'd caught me red handed. He could see the TV from his line of sight into the living room. 

It doesn't work mate, it was left by the previous occupants and I just haven't got around to chucking it out, I told him. 

He obviously didn't believe me so I told him to try it himself. He did,  all he got was a blinking red light and no picture, he fiddled with it for a bit but obviously it was plainly knackered. 

See, doesn't work. 

OK, no problem, he said and tapped something into the little handheld computers they carry with them and told me I was off their list.

About a month later the threatening letters started arriving again.

As OP stated upthread, 91% of abortions occur before 13 weeks (according to dept of health). Very *very* few abortions are actually carried out between 20-24 weeks, and these are usually due to genetic disorders such as anencephaly or Edward's syndrome, abnormalities which are not usually compatible with life - the foetuses would die shortly after birth.  
These disorders are quite often picked up at screening which occurs at 20 weeks, and the parents make the tough decision to abort rather than go through a traumatic birth experience. The actual abortion at that stage is traumatic nevertheless, as a woman at that stage of pregnancy must go through labour - no one makes this decision lightly!",0,1349529608,null,0,false,0,c6igj5o,t3_1118wz,t1_c6igj5o,t1_c6ig60c,null,1430078392,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,courters,flare-brum,Occupy: Shoreditch,"Just a point of reference on the immigration: Academic visitor is meant to imply professors and academic fellowships, not for people who are studying abroad, even in phD programmes. Six months and also of note: OP, you cannot roll your visa from a visitor visa to a work visa while in Britain. You can try and find a job, but you will have to return to the US to make the application for a work permit. That process can take anywhere from 2-4 months -- most companies won't be keen on waiting for all the necessary paperworks; but if you wanted to look while visiting, make sure you have looked at what is needed for the application and have it ready to be filed as soon as you return to the US and that the company you find willing to sponsor you isn't lazy either. Drastically reduces the wait period if you're prepared.

Special relationship aside, American immigration into the UK is extremely tight and difficult. It does not make applying for a work visa any easier than anywhere else with the right qualifications. Him being American will not help with immigration; he'd have it better if he was a Canadian (or other commonwealth) as those are the countries which hold special immigration rules with the UK. America has a special immigration rule in place with Australia, the working holiday for people under 30, which the UK offers to Canadians: America and Britain may be pals in politics, but immigration is a bitch between them both. I have had American friends with companies willing to sponsor them that have had their visas denied. Essentially, to qualify for the Tier 1 his employer will have to prove there is no one in the UK or EU who can do his job to his capability. But I am not an immigration lawyer and if OP is serious about moving to the UK, he needs to consult one.

It was a spur of the moment decision, and having checked Amazon / eBuyer / Play.com it was being sold at a comparable price. So I ordered it for collection in store, then ordered some more RAM via eBuyer.

That afternoon I went into the store, to the customer service point, and showed them my reservation print-out. The one member of staff nips out back, whilst the other one starts trying to sell me some important upgrades - Office, Norton, a printer, etc, etc.

My attempt at explaing to the member of staff why none of those things were important - *I was buying the thing to use as a media centre, so it'd be completely re-formatted, before putting XMBC on* he eventually mumbled something under his breath, and went out back to find his colleague.

A few minutes later? The item I'd reserved - which PCWs website was showing as being in stock, along with ten other PCs of the same description? It was suddenly not in stock.

The manager I asked to speak to? Not available, but I could try again tomorrow. Somewhat perturbed, albeit with a plan forming, I left.

An hour later, a near seventy year old man went into the same PCW branch, with my reservation print-out. He listened intently to the sales patter, agreed to buy all the upgrades - office, anti-virus, a printer, cable, paper etc, etc. The  machine was promptly bought out from back, and he went to the tills.

At which point, he had a change of heart, and decided to just buy the PC. His nice grandson just happened to walk in at that point, and help him carry the PC to the car.

Obviously they abused this freedom but I don't think there was a huge institutional cover up so much as the higher-ups just not interfering in any aspects of the running of radio 1 at the time beyond macro-funding issues. Remember, radio 1 was basically radio Caroline/Luxemburg bought in to the fold and a big part of their being absorbed in to the BBC was retention of editorial control. Everything was arm's length and I think that's why this culture was allowed to persist, because there was no day to day monitoring of what was going on. 

If a Catholic Church comparison were apt this would be affecting more than one department, but all the allegations so far are limited to the ex radio Caroline/Luxemburg DJs who worked in the radio 1 studios.

At present, the BBC is dependant on the TV licensing legislation. The TV licensing fee (and hence the BBCs budget) is determined by section 365 of the Communications Act 2003, and is decided upon by the government.

It is not unreasonable to think that when making editorial decisions about publishing politically sensitive information, the above fact is considered by the editorial staff.

As a result, Reporters without Borders consider the BBC to be a state-controlled media organisation. RwB states this and superinjunctions as reasons why the UK is 28th on the [Press Freedom Index](http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2011-2012,1043.html) behind Slovakia and Mali. 

Clearly with advertising there is a similar risk, but given the BBCs prestige, they would likely have people fighting over advertising space, and could pick-and-choose from advertisers, avoiding (or reporting on) the corrupt ones. Its certainly preferable to the de jure monopoly and imperical mercantillism of the current setup.

Firstly, it generates an attitude that it is justifiable to undertake when someone in their lane isn't going as fast as the driver behind wants them to. This often happens to me, not because I am lane hogging, but because I am maintaining a safe stopping distance. Actually I'm not, I'm just maintaining more of one than most people do. It is much more dangerous to undertake than to lane hog and something that has become increasingly common in the last few years.

Secondly, If I am at the speed limit going 70mph in the middle lane and the slow lane has intermittent lorries in it, but the traffic is heavy enough that I often have to wait to pull back out, then I'm going to stay right where I am. If you think I'm lane hogging because you want to break the speed limit, then fuck you.

Yes, this guy should not have been doing 55mph in the fastest lane, but that problem is minor in comparison to the shitload of tossers who use this to justify their dangerous driving.

Torres spurned another couple of golden chances, also lost control of the ball far too often. While he took his goal well, we should have been 1-0 up early on while he shouldn't have given the keeper a chance with the one-on-one in the final minutes. Against proper opposition those missed chances will cost us

More penalties not given today. I'd consider the two fouls on Hazard and the tub on Terry to all be stonewall penalties. Whether it's the media portrayal of us as divers (sometimes rightly so) or inept refereeing, we've missed out on 5 penalties now. RDM needs to focus on this in the post-match interviews and get it out there that we are missing out due to officiating mistakes. Fair play to JT and Eden, didn't make a big deal about it at all, neither did Ramires when that lard-arse Grant ""Should be playing for England"" Holt kicked out at him

That's all really, great day at the office. I finally can't make it to the Bridge and there's gorgeous weather. In Milan right now and it's grey, windy and wet. Go figure

Edit: Knew I was forgetting something, my pasta-riddled mind overlooked the shooting concern. Basically, I've been saying for some time now that we don't shoot enough. It's often too predictable where we play possession football up to the box then always go for a one-two or a killer dink over the top, both have a very low success rate. I'm not saying shoot on sight, but mix it up. Between Torres, Oscar, Mata and Hazard there's enough ability to shoot from outside the box or pass like we have been doing, but keep the opposition guessing. Peppering the goal can be useful when the opposition is low on confidence, Romeu managed to fire off a couple shots in a few minutes and it made Norwich lose their shape as they began chasing the ball not marking a zone",0,1349539130,null,0,1349540666,0,c6ii02w,t3_111lgj,t1_c6ii02w,t3_111lgj,null,1430079104,25,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,25

Once again, you are confusing violation of physics with violation of canon. I am accepting of violating physics; whatever, I don't like it, but I'll move on.

true,victoriaj,uk,London,"I'm a woman. 

I got involved in an incident on a bus a couple of months ago because I don't stand by when I see something I think isn't OK. 

I was on a bus which got diverted, and some guy went nuts because the bus wasn't going where he want - which it couldn't because the road was closed. I was upstairs and I could hear him banging and swearing and huffing and puffing. He insisted the bus stopped to let him off, but when it did he just stepped up the tantrum and abuse of the driver. I went downstairs and as I stepped of the stairs I heard him call the driver an ""Asian cunt"". I snapped.  

He had kept daring the driver to call the police. I told him his behaviour was unacceptable and if the driver wasn't calling the police I was. He threatened to spit on me, rolling his tongue out and showing me saliva. I looked him in the eye and said I didn't care, that I'd go home and wash and feel better than if I had done nothing. He threatened to slit my throat. He came right up to me, like an inch away - I had to tell him to step back because he was slightly on my foot. He did. He spent some time attempting to out stare me and threaten me and then turned round and got of the bus, trying to pretend he wasn't backing down. 

It was scary. I was also very aware that I was behaving very appropriately but was really acting on anger and not being in control, while he had been trying to frighten everyone by trying to pretend he was out of control, but was scarily controlled. He was actually deeply frightening, and did remind me a bit of the only time I've spent with someone who I know to have been a diagnosed sociopath. (Scariest other than being in a room with a sociopath who'd previously stabbed someone was giving advice to a woman about domestic violence when her partner turned up and tried to barge into the room - got him out in less than a minute mostly by sheer force of glare). 

But I also don't regret it. The driver had tried to placate him and he'd just got worse and worse, he needed someone to stand up to him. And I do have some experience at dealing with difficult people from working with the public so long. 

I fully expect to get this article cut from the paper and handed to me by my mother though. She wasn't terribly happy with what I'd done when she heard - though she would have done the same. My father thought I'd done well. One police person told me I should have been more sensible, and another later told me ""thank you"" for intervening. They didn't track down the man and the case was dropped, partly because the driver didn't report it himself. 

I wouldn't normally be nasty about people who feel they can't get involved though. I think most people are brave and cowardly about different things or in different ways, and that we do all have different levels of skill in dealing with people.

I could of course just be following the wrong folk on Twitter. One of the interesting things about football is how differently we all interpret the same game, with some fans loving certain players who others think are terrible.

I think AVB is generally considered to be a more thoughtful manager, and although it took a few games for us to get going, by this stage, after only one loss and some great away results (not sure why we seem to be struggling more than usual at home), anyone still calling for AVB's removal by now probably will not ever change their stance.

He's done what's been expected of him in winning headers but really nothing much more than that. One of my biggest criticisms of Carroll since I first saw him play for Newcastle is that I think he can be quite lazy. There were two instances in this game where he just walked back from an offside position when WH were threatening. Often when involved in build up play (i.e. long ball to the halfway line which he nods on for a winger) he walks/jogs to the opposition while the winger is breaking quickly looking for options in the box. He should be busting his guts to attack the possible cross with power like we saw Giroud do in the game.

EDIT: I'd just like to add that I do think he's a good player and supported him at LFC but he doesn't fit into BRs plans and honestly we could have bought a couple players that would have been more effective with the £35mil we paid",0,1349547968,null,0,false,0,c6ijton,t3_111pnj,t1_c6ijton,t3_111pnj,null,1430079944,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

&gt;*The rule was finally abolished for practical purposes in the UK with the 1954 case of Michail Onufrejczyk. He and a fellow Pole, Stanislaw Sykut, had stayed in the United Kingdom after the Second World War and ran a farm together in Wales. Sykut disappeared and Onufrejczyk claimed that he had returned to Poland. Bone fragments and blood spatters were found in the farm kitchen, although forensic technology was then insufficiently advanced to identify them. Charged with Sykut's murder, Onufrejczyk claimed that the remains were those of rabbits he had killed, but the jury disbelieved him and he was sentenced to death, but reprieved. He appealed, but this was dismissed by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Goddard, saying that ""things had moved on since the days of the Campden Wonder"" and also
""… it is equally clear that the fact of death, like any other fact, can be proved by circumstantial evidence, that is to say, evidence of facts which lead to one conclusion, provided that the jury are satisfied and are warned that it must lead to one conclusion only.""*

Another factor which I believe came in to play here and led to the resulting violence by the youth was his threat of 'backing down' in a public place, and especially infront of his peers.

I refer to the meta-analysis of Daly and Wilson (1985) where they reviewed a number of conflicts that led to murder in a Detroit prison in 1972.  'Their results were that *victims and offenders were more likely to be lower-class* - i.e. unmarried and unemployed.  These young men had more to gain through potential 'success' of a risky move on a high-status counterpart.  Those of equal status were more likely to resort to aggression in a bid to *rise above their opponent in their local community hierarchy*' [that in quotation marks has been paraphrased from a book].

It all stems from evolution where respect and the high-status of the males would lead to access to territory and women (for bredding purposes).

When's Pearce coming back into the starting lineup? Ian Harte? Gunter? Sean Cummings has had a disasterous day. Mariappa can't seem to mark someone standing still. Ian Harte is at least as good a defender as Nicky Shorey and at least his free kicks are somewhat useful. Imho the back four played best at Chelsea despite the four goals (a penalty, an offside, a long shot with a keeper error and a goal while Federici was in the opposing box at the end). With our midfielders having to constantly cover for a floundering back line it's no wonder we've struggled getting forward. Kebe and McAnuf hardly had opportunities to get forward I don't mind the lack of possession. We've done that before and played amazing games like the away win at Southhampton last season but today defensively we were lazy with the exception of Pogs who probably made more tackles than anyone else. One of our strengths last season was that we outworked other teams and always kept organized while defending as a team. Where did that go? The 2 goals were a gift in an otherwise horrid performance in which Alex McCarthy was the only one trying not to give the two goals back. I'm hoping this is the worst performance of the season.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"I love playing devils advocate. And in this instance, the answer - for me, is pretty simple.

On a personal level? I don't have any kids, nor do I see myself ever having any. But if someone were to murder one of my kids, or a relatives kid, or even a kid I knew, I'd want to inflict a degree of pain on the individual that's barely imaginable. And I'm so far to the left on most social issues it's beyond ridiculous.

*Which is why you can't have emotionally compromised people making the decision. And when you do that, the answer is more clear.*

For me, it's quite simple what should happen in this case. The police, based on their investigation, believe this individual to have murdered April Jones, and presumably disposed of her body somewhere, hence the perverting the course of justice charge. The CPS, it seems, agree.

What needs to happen now is two fold - her body needs to be found, and the police and CPS need to generate a case against him that will lead to his conviction, if they truly believe him to be guilty, as seems to be their belief.

If the evidence presented is strong enough, he should be convicted and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence, with a high minimum tariff. That way he'll remain in prison for a long time, and once he meets that tariff, he'll only be released back into the community once he's satisfied the relevant authorities that he no longer poses a risk to anyone in said community.

Whilst in prison - **and again, all this is predicated on him being both guilty, and convicted**, he should be afforded a reasonable standard of living, and attempts should be made, not only to address and redress the thought process that led to him committing the crime, but measures should be taken to ensure he can re-integrate into the community, assuming this is deemed appropriate.

And as for why all that should happen? Because as a society, we have an obligation to adhere to a societal standard. We should never lower society's' morals to that of the worst in our society.

Same reason why the death penalty should never be re-introduced.",0,1349553034,null,0,false,0,c6ikwix,t3_111geq,t1_c6ikwix,t1_c6ikqbu,null,1430080541,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

The female servant girl was too obviously set up to be a romantic interest for Merlin and to have some kind of connection to the villain. I felt like this could've been a bit subtler.

Scenes with the knights in the mines were, to say the least, an obvious attempt at pleasing the fangirls. I read they were going for a raunchier Merlin to appeal to an older demograph. But it felt out of place. It just felt a bit too obvious. Both in the wardrobe the female leads were wearing the lack of wardrobe on the male ones. 

The dragon wasn't necessary in this episode. But as glimpses suggest in the trailer for the next episode there might be a pay-off. Maybe the budget spent on the dragon could've been used to make that cgi creature later in the episode look at least somewhat less laughable. It's sad that in a show so beautiful as Merlin the CGI still lacks behind.

Wold there be an emotional toll in having a biological child somewhere else - what happens if they change their mind? What if the child wants to find them? Similar to the problems that can arise with adoption.

I actually think that, in such a situation, abortion (at least early abortion) is preferable. A foetus (up to however many weeks, at least) isn't conscious - the people whose lives will be affected are.

I came to human rights law through my main focus of humanitarian law, which is about when and how you can kill in war (amongst other things). There's an interesting relationship between the two fields. Anyway, I found the song unsettling, and it has reminded me about my set anti-execution beliefs.

What we need to remember, however, is that in theory the law is there for protection. If it was ourselves in the position of the suspect in this case, we would surely both want a certain degree of protection, be we guilty or not. By the same token, we would want to have our rights respected. It's the only way we can ensure that everyone is kept safe - and I think being kept safe from unfair attribution of guilt is important.

I think they could emancipate themselves, much like giving a child up for adoption. For all intents are purposes, it's the same as an abortion for the parents - they lose all rights and responsibilities on the day of the procedure. 

Resources - perhaps not as much as you might think. Tissue engineering can be quite resource efficient. You basically need to manage temperature and nutrition. Hell, in 50-100 years maybe everybody would opt to ""give birth"" like that. Carrying a baby around inside your belly is quite crazy if you think about it! Far more efficient to decide ""we want a baby"", then pop to the clinic, then go collect it in 9 months! No pain, no danger to the mother, no time off work etc :P

Emotional toll - perhaps, but that's the same with abortion which certainly has emotional impact on the parents. Same for if they change their mind. You can't change your mind after an abortion, so you shouldn't be able to do it after the fetus removal procedure either. I think the solution would be to simply say that if you have the procedure for fetus removal, you lose all rights and responsibility right there and then.

As for the child growing up - I'm not an expert, but I think that's a societal thing where an adopted child feels the urge to know their biological parents.

true,CannibalHolocaust,uk,London,"The way I see it is that a woman is allowed to 'terminate' her pregnancy essentially meaning forcibly evacuating the foetus out of her womb. Obviously at the earlier stages she is evacuating an embryo or foetus which doesn't have a beating heart so was never alive (and thus she hasn't killed anyone). However, if she terminates her pregnancy at 8 months and this results in a living person* dying or being harmed (or risk of harm) then she would be liable to prosecution as she has harmed (or possibly harmed) another person.

*Living person here would be defined as a foetus which is alive when aborted, obviously defining what 'alive' is is tricky. Some would say when it has a beating heart (6 weeks), others when it has fully functioning organs and nervous system, others when it can feel pain (personally I think this is a weak argument as some people never feel pain). I don't think 'viability' is a good one because it's a moving target but then again the heartbeat limit is very early and many women won't know they're pregnant that early.

If the national rail system wasn't gutted to favour the heavily subsidised de-unionising road system tied to the oil industry, I would suggest that trains could do that with greater efficacy.

I've tried several ""respected"" publishers (Guardian, Telegraph, BBC, etc) but typically they don't actually link to the survey (which mentions 700 miles so it's probably the same as you were thinking of), but parrot the same quotes. It's one of those stories where a press release gets issued and no one does any proper investigative criticism. And it's not really framed like building more motorways but as lost capacity, you'd still get bottlenecks near conurbations and collisions. The survey from what I can gather is based on the anecdotal evidence of 15'000 drivers so I'm inclined to distrust their findings. It seems like a convenient scapegoat to mask poor design, the stupidity of the car as a mass transportation (in reality it's mass personal transportation), perhaps under investment, or the 11k injured on UK motorways.

I think you are being too hard on him about the second one. Everyone in here can agree he needs to shoot more and hesitate less.

The deposit for European elections is also £5,000, so I imagine this figure was chosen on the same basis. I assume it will have a similar threshold for recovery of the deposit (5% iirc).

That said, as someone who does work for a small political party, these deposits are a real pain, and pretty much limit campaigning to local elections (deposit-less) or the odd MP election (the Party is standing in a by-election caused by one MP resigning to stand for the regional PCC). Do they keep ordinary (non-super rich) people out of national politics? Sure. Do they keep crazy people out? No, only badly-funded crazy people. They're just one of the many barriers to a multi-party political system in England and Wales (including FPTP elections).

As for the actual PCCs, I haven't read up on them much (the elections are probably going to be a disaster as no one really cares about them), but the idea of politicising the police sounds pretty terrible. There was a big stir recently after it was announced that Magistrates (voluntary, ""lay"" judges in the lowest criminal courts) couldn't also stand; England already has a huge problem with lay magistrates being ... well, the sort of people who want to play judge, with all the prejudices that go with that, and I hate to think what will happen if those sorts of people end up with power over policing...",0,1349563525,null,0,false,0,c6in5kb,t3_111pph,t1_c6in5kb,t3_111pph,null,1430081578,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I find nothing wrong with this place being sort of a sanctuary from all the bullshit we have to read every day in other areas of the internet. 

I worry about our lack of killer instinct, but that's honestly a mental thing that has plagued Spurs for far longer than I've been a fan. I worry about our squad not having a real engine midfielder who wants to pass the ball 80 times a game and is comfortable picking the ball up in any situation to dictate the play. 

That said, I love the philosophy. I love the organization we've shown. It's something I've always wanted to see from Spurs. Is it a little more measured and less exciting at times? Yes. But it can also absolutely asphyxiate teams and when it comes together it's terrifying to behold. 

We are limiting opponents to very few chances (which they are unfortunately taking basically every time) and we're creating a lot of them ourselves; we just need to start taking more of them.

I'm not racist but...i should be*allowed* to call anyone anything i like on the internet, and to say anything i think. People getting arrested for racist tweets is fucking ridiculous. 

but starting a page openly calling for the death of someone? That has to be against the law. no matter what they have or are believed to have done, you can NOT go around telling people they should be killed, and asking people for further input on how to go about it. Someone will get the idea in their head that it's the right thing to do and then we have a murder on our hands. And if that person is innocent..well..fuck. 
This is not the 11th century. We can't just assume someone is guilty and amass a group of people that wish to see this person dead.

I suppose the biggest problem I see is that abortion is permanent. If you give away your child/foetus, there's a lot of potential drama later on. If you abort, that's permanent. It can still cause a lot of trauma, but nothing can actually be done about it.

If foetus 'adoption' really became commonplace, I can imagine, whatever legal measures were in place, there would be many biological parents later trying to get 'their' children back, at least at first - maybe after the technology had been around for a while, it would become accepted that you had no right to that child.

I imagine it would be very hard to lose the urge to find your biological parents - I can see it becoming normal to see your adopted parents as your 'real' parents, but surely there'd always be curiosity about your history? But that might just be me being curious about genetics.

And The 13th Doctor, weary of his travels and at the end of his regeneration cycle, decides to settle down and have a family.

The Doctor's entire family is murdered, he and his granddaughter the only survivors. It was the Daleks, of course. They've grown strong in the Doctor's absence, and they are many. Too many. And stronger than The Doctor can handle on his own. In his rage and desperation, he knows the only way to defeat them is to free his fellow Gallifreyans. The Time Lords, returned from the time-locked Time War, and blaming The Doctor for his part in locking them in to begin with, exile him. The Doctor and his companion, despairing in the loss of their family, seek refuge on his favorite planet: Earth. 

As the Time War rages anew, the laws of time and space become...wibbly-wobbly. Things are in disarray, all over the universe, and time does not operate as it should. And The Doctor knows what must be done. To save the universe, and his entire family. But it's going to take a very long time. He'll have to go the long way 'round. Forward. 

He's reset the universe before. It won't be difficult to do it a second time. So The Doctor and his granddaughter take the TARDIS outside of the universe, outside of time and space, to restart this whole timeline that ended with the death of everyone. And as he does so, to save all of existence, he loses his last life in the process--but this is a reset! Everyone gets a new beginning, everyone and everything. Even The Doctor. *Everybody lives!* And so, the 13th Doctor regenerates...into the First Doctor. And he and his granddaughter, Susan, travel to the point where this whole sequence of events began.

The credits have indeed used the wrong forms at several times, as recently as Eccleston's run (he's credited as ""Doctor Who""; still wrong). Those credits are not correct and that is not the character's name (and even if there was ambiguity in the very early series, there is none now and hasn't been for decades). Yes, it's weird that a show doesn't get its own credits right but hey, the character is pretty unique.

A couple more facts to back this up: In the show, the character is not referred to by the presumed last name of Who and does not refer to himself as anything other than the Doctor. Also, the actors and producers all acknowledge the correct name, and in one example Tennant specifically asked for the credits to be corrected when he began the role following Eccleston. Lastly (for now), the two Dalek movies with Peter Cushing in the '60s are specifically set apart from the TV show because that character *is* a doctor and his last name *is* Who, and that character is explicitly *not* the Doctor from the TV show.

Whew. I'm really trying not to be pedantic, but knowing the character's correct name has always seemed to me to be a big marker of an observant fan. And yeah, that includes knowing that the credits have been wrong sometimes!

Some of the species he's fought from that time include the Nestene Consciousness (S1E1), the Racnoss (Christmas '06), the Carrionites (S3E2), and even the Vashta Nerada and the Weeping Angels are thought to be from that aeon. The point is, before our time, there was more time, but probably not much before that.

2. Space is finite. Modern science tells us the universe is infinitely large, but we'll ignore them. In the episode ""The Doctor's Wife"" (S6E5), they land on a planet 'outside the universe'. If there is anything 'outside' the universe, that means the universe has an edge, implying it is finite.

3. Parallel dimensions are sealed off. In ""Rise of the Cybermen"" (S2E5) they accidentally land on an alternate Earth. Not only does the Doctor declare inter-dimensional travel impossible, but the TARDIS can't really survive outside its own reality.

4. Time doesn't *really* change that much. There is some evidence from the show that seems to indicate time can be re-written (including the Doctor himself professing exactly that). However, it seems unlikely if not impossible that the Doctor could change something enough to create entirely new places and times to explore. Maybe an example would make this one more clear. He's been in London during WWII several times. He could keep going back to WWII, and visit every town in every country. But he probably couldn't *prevent* WWII from happening, then visit all those towns in all those countries again during peacetime.

If those five assumptions are true, then the Doctor will, eventually, run out of space and time. Fortunately for us, our lifespans are short enough that we could watch him every second of our lives and not see even a fraction of his adventures.",0,1349587127,null,0,false,0,c6isafr,t3_1126b1,t1_c6isafr,t3_1126b1,null,1430084102,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

And then when he doesn't score, it's bad because as a striker you obviously need to be taking your chances, even if it is a half-chance.

true,duelingmike,dalek,Dalek,"I see a couple flaws and some good stuff too here, lets go in order

1. Time was ending for the humans because the stars were burning out, we are not sure if there is still an extremely cold universe after that. Should the latter be true than the tardis would probably be able to keep the doctor warm past that point for an infinite time
2. The ""dark times"" was not the earliest recorded time period ever in an episode, the devil from the episode satan pit said he had existed before time itself which implies some alternate exsistence to time
3. Many modern theories suggest that the universe is expanding at an exponential rate, if that is true then there is an infinite amount of space. The fact that they made it outside the universe doesn't mean that the universe is finite, they left the universe and went to an alternate universe several times in David tennants time and that would technically be outside the universe, you could consider the bubble universe under the same properties of lying ""outside"" the infinite universe
4.nothing to note really, everything in assumption 4 is perfectly accurate except I think he mentions that the void is untouched by time and ""universes could dies"" while your waiting in the void for a long time
5.the doctor has already been to certain places during same or nearly the same time but he wasn't in the exact place or exact time as a previous him. Interacting with himself is a paradox so he can't do it unless he was everybody and was unaware originally when he interacted with himself. Oh and he could change what happens but only slightly like in the episode Father's Day with Chris eccelston, originally Pete Tyler died alone by his car, but his death was a fixed point so the only thing that changed was when he died in his perception. If the doctor had an infinite lifespan it would be physically impossible to continue traveling without creating a paradox under these circumstances but he could potentially exist forever in a void ship without making a paradox",0,1349594166,null,0,false,0,c6itbcp,t3_1126b1,t1_c6itbcp,t1_c6isafr,null,1430084554,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Why we’re marching

Austerity isn’t working

Our country faces long-term economic problems. But our political leaders have failed to face up to them.

For the next five years or more, unless policies change the economy will not grow, incomes will not rise, and there will be almost no new jobs.

If the government keeps on with big spending cuts and austerity  we face a lost decade. Even on their own terms government policies are failing. To close the deficit we need a healthy growing economy that generates tax income. But austerity has led to a vicious circle of decline.

Instead of just letting the banks go back to business and bonuses as usual, we need policies that promote new and old industries.

This new approach would create jobs, especially for young people.

It would encourage companies to raise average pay, penalise big bonuses and invest in training and new industries. It would crack down on tax evasion by big companies and the super-rich. It would tackle the growing inequality between the super-rich and everyone else.

Rather than deep, rapid spending cuts, we need to reverse our decline and build an economy that works for ordinary families.
We need a future that works. Will you join us?",0,1349598269,null,0,false,0,c6its4h,t3_111fcq,t1_c6its4h,t1_c6ihkp6,null,1430084771,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Yeah I'm going to need you to provide a source for that, along with a decent clarification on exactly how much more/less violent these genes can make you.

I'm pretty sure that any study that finds a ""violent gene"" will also find that this violent gene has no significant impact on the probability of a carrier being violent due to the completely overwhelming influence of their envornment.

Nothing constructive will come from that attitude. Even if your belief is proved true then idiotic prejudice and eletism will run rampant among the non-carriers, while carriers will feel justified and excused to commit violent acts because ""They can't help it, it's in their genes"".

The amounts quoted for minor motorway repairs (£3,000) seem pretty small if you ask me. Repairs are not cheap. And those who cause accidents aren't exactly friends of the public. They still owe us lost time.

Just as genetics makes some people bright at maths (of course environment will mean if you really get to use that genetic ability to its full or not) some people are more prone to aggressive attitudes. I don't understand how anyone can hold another opinion really, sure it might be inconvenient for our society sticking our heads in the sand that certain people have a genetic collection that gives them a short fuse is probably not the answer either.

-No Tim Hortins (we have over priced star bucks and a few alternatives)

-If you love vancouver downtown then you'll love london (squashed, old style buildings, tiny roads, loads of traffic)

-You will need health insurance since your coming from a non e.u country

-The weather is shit

-Cars are smaller and gas is more expensive

-Trains are really expensive with no a.c(no cheap metro here)

-Houses and general space is all on a small limited factor.

The benefits if you want to come -

-Its quite cheap for you to come over as the rate is £1  = $1.50 (Once you add tax into most products you get in both countrys the difference is minimal)

-Look at canadianaafair for cheap flights. You can get to Gatwick in 7 hours ands it cheaper then flying to vancouver.

So excuse me when I say protest in a proper manner, like protest voting, rather than cause havoc in my streets.

Also, surprise surprise, not everyone agrees with the protesters, and even the most orderly protests cause disruption, so I think it's perfectly reasonable for me to say people shouldn't do it at the drop of a hat like they do now.

Just remember this, Glasgow to London by train takes under 4 hours so wherever you end up basing yourself it's easy to visit different Towns, Cities &amp; Counties relatively easily &amp; cheaply.

Compared to Canada living is a lot more expensive (i think its about $1.50 CAD for every £1), but don't let that put you off.

Similar arguments can be applied to sports, the military, ethnic/religious minorities and people working in the same industry.

Three year time-skip!?  Well okay.  (At the beginning of the episode, Arthur says they have had 3 years of prosperity.)   So what, it's got to have been at least 8 years since season 1 for Mordred to have grown that much?  I like it, buuuut...

+ We need to keep the ball more, our midfield/defence are looking frustrated and are just whacking the ball or playing *very* optimistic through balls.

+ Fans are seemingly nonexistent, I thought we were playing away at first.

Why?

FUCK YOU! That's why. 

Now, of course they want to make money, and they have a monopoly on the transport in the area, so that's their 'right'. 

This will of course simply add to the misery of the drivers, but it's not like they give a flying fuck about people being HAPPY. Fuck that. We've been miserable on that fucking crossing for YEARS.

Congestion? FUCK that! They don't give a FUCK about how long it takes, just as long as you pay. 

But they are not deaf to the pleas of the common man. To make things 'better' for you they will introduce 'quicker' barrier (electronic payment or something) that will somehow make the crossing less of an abject misery.

BUT THERE'S MORE! Rather than simply make it a free crossing, as they promised, the solution may be to build... ANOTHER BRIDGE, slightly further down the river to the east. This will of course be another toll bridge. Will it decrease prices as competition between the two comes in? Of course it won't.

Bullshit. Driving doesn't cause obesity, bad diet causes obesity.

This is ridiculous. So you're blaming motorists for motorists being late to work. Do you not see the roundabout logic in that?

However, I people seem more reticent to go out of the way to do that these days, whether because of worrying about the intent of others, or just because there are more attractions in the home now with TV, computers etc.

I live in quite a large village and I am a plumber and electrician so I get round quite a few houses. I get to speak to a lot of people of all ages and backgrounds. Therefore I know quite a lot of the villagers and see them around and about to say hello to.

The village has a number of social events and two good pubs. There is a good local shop with post office and a primary and secondary school. There is also two hairdressers, a chip shop and a butchers. I think all these things combined go towards more interaction between people, more conversations, more events and therefore more of a community spirit. 

Once you take some of those things away, remove the shop as everyone goes to tescos, remove the school as everyone goes to a bigger school in a bigger town, remove the shops as people go elsewhere, then you have fewer interactions between people, fewer friends in the local area and therefore less of a community spirit.

Therefore, I think it is still there in many places, but missing in others. It just takes a few people in an area to do something about it to make sure it's there. If no one can be bothered, then it's not going to happen.

* Gerrard had a poor game.  He was alright for the first hour, but then it looked like he just switched off.  He wasn't running hard, giving up on plays, heaving hopeless long balls, and lost the touch on a few passes.


* The Joe Cole substitution was a good move.  The whole team looked to be lagging a bit after the hour mark.  Joe was a bright spot the second his boots hit the pitch.  He was running hard, chasing back in defense, and really provided a boost.  One of the less experienced younger players needed to make way for someone to push the game forward.

* I was hoping to see Sterling come off. I thought Sterling actually played pretty well.  But, Lee Mason was letting people play sooo physically that it really negated Sterling's pacy advantage.  Defenders would literally hang on to him and he was never really able to break away. (Speaking of Sterling that two footed challenge from behind made by Whitehead.  In what planet is that a yellow card?)

* Tactics were poor in the end.  Again, after the hour mark things just started to break down.  Stoke REALLY parked the bus and LFC had no idea how to get through.  None.  I think this is more to do with the players getting tired, but it was nonetheless frustrating to watch.

Let's say by household income is £60K for mortgage purposes and I've got around £25K saved up. So I could take out a £250K mortgage and buy a house at £260K (need some left over for expenses and decorating). On a 25 year term at 4.5 that's £1,400/month or around 45% of our income.

Now as we don't want to live in a rough £260K area that money will buy a smallish two bedroom flat out in zone 6.

At those rates I'm not willing to buy a house in the SE for the following reasons

1) Loan to income is so hideously bad that you're always on the knife edge of finance

2) I don't believe it's sustainable.

I don't think the current SE house prices are sustainable because I don't believe that everyone under 35 is going to sit back and say ""I don't mind a much lower standard of living than my parents because it's right that the baby boomers took out 110% of what they put into the welfare state.""

And it's this which is the difference between Premiership and Championship football.

tl;dr we're not playing zonally. We have fantastic dribblers in McAnuff, Kebe, Karacan, and we have the run of wide-space in our wingers and full-backs but we're *not bringing them into the game*. Every time Gorkss or McCarthy gets a touch on the ball I'm screaming, because it means the inevitable has happened and we've lost the run of play, run out of ideas, and started playing backwards.

Why did we concede? Because we aren't thinking like premier league footballers. Jay Tabb out, Pogrebnyak on the bench, McCleary to start next next week, please. Y'know that ""creative midfielder"" we were begging for? We still haven't got him, but if we just had someone who could play the ball into the acres of space we're creating, rather than sideways-and-backwards, we wouldn't be in the fucking mess we're in.

Also, Cummings was brilliant yesterday IMO and has earned his place in the starting XI. Can't wait for Guthrie to come back too.",0,1349628555,null,0,false,0,c6ixk2s,t3_111prw,t1_c6ixk2s,t3_111prw,null,1430086551,1,false,Urz,t5_2trfe,1

true,EdmondDantes71,null,null,"Average performance by us. We knew what we would be getting with 
Stoke so complaining about it is no help (except that foot stamp by Huth that was a red card) but we just didnt make enough opportunities in the final third.

Stoke did well to disrupt our tempo; we had difficulty a few times getting the ball out from Reina, but more importantly Allen and Sahin were not their usual boss selves in midfield. Not sure what overall possession nos. were but im pretty sure it wasnt high which is what we should always be aiming for against a team like stoke. 

Best chances for us were Johnson coming in off the Gerrard long ball (the one good thing he did all game) and when Suarez did his thing and ran past 4 people and missed when he was 1 on 1 with the goalie. You note how both chances were on the counter, our slow build up just wasnt working for us because every final ball in the third was either ineffective or was on a wing and then nothing came of it. I feel like every damn red should be training to put better balls into the box, whether on the ground or crossing because both passing and the positioning in the box when we already have the ball in the final third has been poor all season.

MOTM: Agger. He bossed the back line, kept Crouch quiet and made some great tackles when we were in trouble and actually looked like the best attacking threat when he ran with the ball into the midfield. I seriously love when he does that as all the midfielders simply expect the CB to pass but he just keeps pushing through and makes opportunities.  
Hon Mention: Sterling. He was good in midfield and beat quite a few players. Loved how even when got out muscled he would sprint back to try to get the ball. But for all his agile play when the ball was up near the box he wasnt able to do much. I think more game time is needed, but he actually needs work with skills that dont involve the ball at his feet (a decent cross, or shooting at goal, and even positioning in that final third)

Gerrard had a shocker but the rest of the team were ok. But only ok. Cant say we should be doing too much differently for 2/3rds of the pitch but that final third is lacking everything. Happy with a clean sheet though. Finally.

Draw is as well as we could expect",0,1349628674,null,0,false,0,c6ixl2n,t3_113a3t,t1_c6ixl2n,t3_113a3t,null,1430086564,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

On top of it's limited size, it's got a large ""hippie"" contingent left over from the 1970s, so there's still a heavy reliance on a community shops: their anger and campaigning against the opening of a Tesco was what you'd expect if someone pissed on a wasps nest, on the grounds that there was already a new Tesco in Newtown, a mere 30 miles away, and a Morrisons just 20 miles down the road in Aberystwyth. Everyone doesn't quite know everyone there, but they'll know someone who does.

true,NotMud,null,null,"There are a number of sides to this coin, which I suppose makes it more of an ingot really.

Firstly, as you point out, we already have perfectly adequate databases and there are those who would question the need for another. So far the only justification for it has been vague cries of ""terrorism"", but there's no real evidence to suggest that terrorists would be thwarted by identification cards.

Secondly there's the general practicality of the whole arrangement. The driving licence database, the PNC and the passport systems all *just about work* but the NHS and several other organisations have been seriously affected by terrible decisions at every stage of the IT procurement process. The notion that there should be another, general level of identification, kept for an undisclosed purpose, stored in a database maintained by the lowest bidder is actually quite an off-putting one for the majority of people. Who'd run it? Serco? Siemens? The more you think about it, the worse it gets. Maybe it'd be run by civil servants? The amount of data involved would barely fit onto a thousand tonnes of paper, but somehow they'd manage to leave it on a train. The whole carriage creaking, paper pressed up against the door buttons - you think I'm joking, but this is a very real possibility.

Then there's the money. Billions and billions of money that could be spent on almost anything other than a slightly Orwellian ego project ridden by a handful of politicians who'll be dead before the true effect - both financial and social - will be felt.

Winston Churchill scrapped wartime ID cards because they aren't needed in a time of peace. I'm not sure how useful they were during the war, but trumping up the ""war on terror"" into something that might necessitate the widespread adoption of identity cards is unlikely to be convincing.

I'm not sure how much most people care about this. I'm not sure how much *I* care about this. But one thing's for sure - when people realise that **they** have to pay for these mandatory identity cards and that there'll be a financial penalty for not carrying them, they'll start questioning whether they're a good idea at all.",0,1349630346,null,0,false,0,c6ixzem,t3_1137lb,t1_c6ixzem,t1_c6ixnzm,null,1430086763,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

On iTunes you can access the classic offerings sorted by Doctor by selecting menus following these steps in order:  iTunes Store; TV Shows; Category - Sci-Fi &amp;amp;amp; Fantasy (top right drop down); More in TV - Doctor Who (second from bottom right drop down); then you have the listings from Eleventh Doctor at the top to First Doctor at the bottom. These are much cheaper than buying the DVDs.

Then there is your public library, many have the DVDs for checkout. More may be obtained by interlibrary loan.

Amazon has pretty much all the DVDs, sometimes they have used ones at a significant discount via Amazon Merchants.

Now, if you want to know where the available episodes from any of these sources fall within the original broadcast order, this Wikipedia guide is your friend:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials

Let me say right away that In Classic Who, viewing order is nowhere near as important as the new series. Most serials were stand-alone stories, multi-episode story arcs were the exception, not the rule. There were a few connected stories, notably the Trial of a Time-Lord season, the E-Space Trilogy, the Black Guardian Trilogy; and The Key to Time Series. Other than that, you really don't have to worry a lot about watching the episodes in order. Personally, I like skipping around from Doctor to Doctor for variety.

1) It was Rory's first encounter with the Weeping Angels and any guy would be freaked out upon seeing them. He'll probably be shot if he runs up. He didn't get out of the basement, the cherubs sent him to Winter Quay.


2) Ditto. Though I would rather they have had time together in previous seasons instead.


3 and 4) Yeah. I also had a problem with the invasion of the Angels. I was thinking there shouldn't be any person left outside of Winter Quay if the Angels have taken over Manhattan. I understand how the Cherubs could have come in to existence but I never understood how the other statues became Weeping Angels. Another problem I've had with them is how the Angels are no longer ""weeping."" The Cherubs' and the mother and son's faces were always visible. I would have preferred if they also delved into why that other Angel was smiling.

The people who could be buying their own house if mortgages were more available or house prices were lower, are instead paying the mortgages of people who own multiple properties.

This is combined with the negative equity issue where people refuse to take a loss on their house bought during the period of house price increases.

The simple answer would be that first time buyers should be more willing to move towards cheaper areas outside the south east of England.

Why has nothing been done? Dartford MP Gareth Johnson campaigned on scrapping the tolls, yet when he got in we heard **nothing** for two fucking years. And instead of scrapping the tolls, we got a plan for a camera system to collect tolls - which they might start thinking about looking at considering in *another* two years - and we have to pay *more* for it!

true,timhm,eng-kent,Kent,"Hello, fellow HPCer here. Short and dirty of it is thus:

House prices rocketed into the stratosphere on the back of limited construction, increased migration, lending deregulation and low interest rates causing a credit boom (think Northern Rock's 125% madness) and a big expansion in buy to let. Oh, and a generation of people willing to let it happen.

Prices haven't fallen despite FtBs being locked out of the market because there is still a relative shortage of supply, nearly 4 years of record low interest rates (BoE won't raise rates because they know the banks [can't afford it](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19842201)), and finally our gutless politicians know that it's politically unpalatable to let house prices drop so they throw younger people to the wolves and prop up the bubble with schemes like shared ownership, firstbuy etc.

I think we will see a gradual deflation of house prices over a long time (~10-20 years) along with stagflation, like Japan has had.

Personally I'm open to moving further north, but I find it difficult to make friends and there's still a lot of uncertainty in the job market.

true,CannibalHolocaust,uk,London,"&gt;The district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, alleged that the men were part of an effort to protect a prominent member of the Satmar Hasidic community, Nechemya Weberman, who has been accused of 88 counts of sexual misconduct, including oral sex with a child younger than 13 years old. The charges all involve one girl, now 17, who was referred by her school to get counseling by Mr. Weberman, and then alleged she was abused by him during therapy sessions.

&gt;The charges are the first time in at least two decades that Mr. Hynes has charged Hasidic Jews with intimidation of a witness in a sexual abuse case, even though victims, their advocates and prosecutors say intimidation has long been a major obstacle to prosecution of abuse among the ultra-Orthodox. In recent weeks, Mr. Hynes has been saying that the intimidation of witnesses in the ultra-Orthodox community is worse than in the world of organized crime.

[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/nyregion/4-ultra-orthodox-men-charged-with-trying-to-silence-accuser-in-abuse-case.html?pagewanted=all](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/nyregion/4-ultra-orthodox-men-charged-with-trying-to-silence-accuser-in-abuse-case.html?pagewanted=all)

&gt;Abuse victims and their families have been expelled from religious schools and synagogues, shunned by fellow ultra-Orthodox Jews and targeted for harassment intended to destroy their businesses. Some victims’ families have been offered money, ostensibly to help pay for therapy for the victims, but also to stop pursuing charges, victims and victims’ advocates said.

[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/nyregion/ultra-orthodox-jews-shun-their-own-for-reporting-child-sexual-abuse.html?pagewanted=all](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/nyregion/ultra-orthodox-jews-shun-their-own-for-reporting-child-sexual-abuse.html?pagewanted=all)

&gt;In recent months, Mr. Hynes and his aides have said the program has contributed to an effective crackdown on child sexual abuse among ultra-Orthodox Jews, saying it had led to 95 arrests involving more than 120 victims.

&gt;But Mr. Hynes has taken the highly unusual step of declining to publicize the names of defendants prosecuted under the program — even those convicted. At the same time, he continues to publicize allegations of child sexual abuse against defendants who are not ultra-Orthodox Jews.

&gt;This policy of shielding defendants’ names because of their religious status is not followed by the other four district attorneys in New York City, and has rarely, if ever, been adopted by prosecutors around the country.

&gt;Some sex-crime experts and former prosecutors said the policy contributed to a culture of secrecy in ultra-Orthodox communities, which made it harder to curb sexual abuse.

Patients are suffering from understaffed facilities. Nurses and healthcare assistants are working to the point of breaking and yet still things are getting worse. And people have the audacity to criticise NHS management and, even worse, the front line staff.

Fwiw, I don't see what's foolish about lending more than 3.5x- you need to consider affordability and loan to value. If you can afford the repayments and youre starting with a decent enough equity then borrowing 5x isn't inherently bad.

How much have you managed to save in 5 years? I was really fortunate and inherited a big deposit from my late grandfather, I don't really know how I'd have got here otherwise.

Then again, property ownership isn't a right IMO - I still consider it a privilege. You can still lead a perfectly decent life by renting or house sharing. Also, you don't need an average priced house as your first step on the ladder - by looking at something much below average price and considering the higher than average salaries, it starts to sound a lot less sensationalist.

I can understand that, but I have been going to the same pubs, post office, takeaway etc for a long time and with the exception of one kebab place who I can speak to in his native language, there doesn't seem to be much in the community aspect. My post office is just 1 minute walk away and I go regularly, same with my local Coop. My local pub is god awful so I don't go there.

I see my area as not a community as like I said in the OP, I know one guy in the near area and he has been a friend since school times. My old secondary school is just two minutes walk away.

Like I said, this may be the result of the city and I can respect that villages may be different, especially for people with jobs such as yours, but for me the feeling is different.

Of course I cant say my reaction to an event such as April Jones if it happened in my area, but if it did I can imagine I would be appaled and may keep an eye out as much as possible but I do not see any form of cooperation that has been shown by the people of Mach.

I have lived here for 7 years and yet I still know noone aside from my childhood friends and my next door neighbour.

It seems the city is completely the opposite to the country, yes. This is interesting as I hoped that it would be a more human nature thing to form communities and the fact that it was failing in the city was the result of the end of this need for the communal. Maybe I am wrong but still I am a little bit curious as to how Mach will be after all this, will it have damaged the community as a supposedly close knit one managed to have such a horrible event in it or will it strengthen it?

true,pseudonym1066,null,null,"London prices in general are absurd. I mean £4 for a pint of beer? I know where it comes from with basic supply and demand, but the point I was making is that there are many places where that kind of money could be better spent. 20% of the world's population live on less than a £1 a day, 30,000 people die daily of a lack of food, and yet we think nothing of spending vast sums on housing. It just seems an inappropriate use of money. In that narrow sense I meant it is out of step with world GDP/capita.

Yes, of course I know that there are many other countries/cities with high cost of living, NY and Tokyo among them, but it seems particularly acute in London. The average in most other western European capital cities is generally much lower for example.

""your initial mistake of starting the conversation with the national wage average vs the house prices in just the SE.""
This wasn't a mistake, it was partly to make a point about how expensive it is in London, but also because I had difficulty finding an accurate figure for average SE wages. If you read the description below, I did make a point of comparing directly average wages in London:average house prices. The ratio is 1:10. This isn't a sensible ratio, and I'd imagine it is similar for the SE generally. This ratio is absurd.

If you really want to nitpick, I've just double checked my own figures, and the average price in the SE is actually lower than the figure I stated £280k rather than £370k, which is specifically for London. Still though the point about ratios holds. A 1:10 ratio is just absurd.

The ladder essentially moved up, and nothing came in to replace it other than flatsharing, living with parents or living in a relatively low end property for your earnings.

I can't say with confidence that he is diving or just going down cause he tripped himself.

Also, look at the position of the ball. It is not like it got away from him.  If he hadn't gone down, it is more then likely that he would have gotten the ball.  Additionally, there is really no advantage to be gain there.  It isn't a goal scoring opportunity, the keeper most likely wouldn't be booked, and AT BEST it would be a free kick in a decent position.  If he HAD gotten the ball, the goal keeper is WAY off his line, and with a little work, would most likely result in a goal or a decent chance.

There are exams you'll need to take for FCO jobs, not to mention varying levels of security clearance. Ordinarily, once you've passed your exams I think you have to work in London for a less-than-average salary for a couple of years.

To get a taste of what it might be like, the FCO does provide work experience for sixth formers. Have a look at [their website](http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/working-for-us/) for more information on this front, as well as looking at the kind of jobs they offer.

If you're not interested in being an *actual diplomat*, you'll just need excellent language skills. [Visit the website of the British High Commission in Islamabad for job information](http://ukinpakistan.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/recruitments) - they have a few vacancies and it'll give you a taste for what they like.

&gt;How does one work towards that goal?

Work hard. Get impeccable A-level results. Teach yourself Urdu (important) and spend your free time learning about the geopolitics of that part of the world. Apply to a very good university and do a relevant course. Undertake work experience at the FCO and don't fuck it up. Anything's possible if you're really determined.

true,hyundai_cakes,null,null,"Apart from the fact that the average person wouldn't have had anything like 150k to spend on housing, I'm not convinced by the argument. If you have a property, all of the cash value is tied up in it. It's an illiquid asset. People are living longer and the government is forcing people to use assets to pay for care. Ultimately, no one is going to inherit any of this wealth, you'll be forced to sell your house or join an equity release scheme to raise the money to pay for the care.     
The reason that older people can afford 'a lot of nice things' these days is because the cost of them has dropped like a stone (madeinchina, easyjet) whereas the cost of property has increased a lot. Not only because of people speculating but also because of the very very rich in London pushing up the limited number of top end properties through the roof, which has a trickle down effect, combined with 'not enough properties being built'. House prices also increased a lot in the early 70s in percentage terms.    

The thing to consider is this, all this QE will have to kick in at some point in the form of inflation. They are simply trying to inflate away all the debt. With the combined increase in interest rates, a lot of people who are currently 'up to their necks in it' will drown, triggering a market collapse.

true,davegod,uk,United Kingdom,"I'm in similar situation here in Edinburgh. 

Prices are still ridiculously inflated. They are everywhere because homeowners in the main simply cannot accept making a paper loss, even if they are going to buy somewhere similarly devalued. For decades prices have risen at stupid levels and it's just unfathomable to most owners that they might lose money on their investment. Even those that do recognise that, well they need the seller of the house they want to buy to recognise it... 

Then there's all the folks in negative equity, clinging on in there because the base rate is so low. Not forgetting the buy-to-let market, which is substantial in Edinburgh. These guys inflate the market heavily because renting for a return even below mortgage rates isn't a bad return even before factoring in the capital appreciation. They're not selling because why would they when the market is down - although the banks are starting to catch up with those who were financing it all by mortgages.

Government is going to do everything they can to avoid further correction because it's bad for the short term i.e. politically untenable. 

If the prices weren't bad enough, it's the mortgages. Unless you have a 40% deposit, new mortgages have very high interest + base rate. I scrimped and saved ridiculously ever since I commenced employment so have a 25% deposit on a shithole and the mortgage would be affordable *now*, but all too obviously unaffordable as soon as the base rate goes back to normal. And then there's the job uncertainty. Not only do I need a big deposit for the mortgage, I need quite a bit left over in savings.

Government are intent on making this worse basically because banks have to retain silly profits to rebuild their balance sheets and aren't allowed to take risks. Rightly or wrongly we are again screwed over.

Saving is getting to be irritating. Savings rates are less than the house price increase, so part of what I'm putting in each month is just to keep up. I'm scrimping away just to lose money to inflation... It does not help either that I have to repay student loans. 

What happens when the base rate changes anyway? Will all the folks who overstretched in 2006-08 suddenly be unable to meet their payments, triggering another crash? I think that for first time buyers the folly in the market is all too obvious. Unlike every generation before me, I do not accept that house prices will always rise, so am much more risk averse. 

So parents? Well they had too many kids (not that I'm complaining, being the last one) and how fucked up is it if we're relying on parents to get a deposit? Even inheritance, our parents are living a lot longer than theirs did. It used to be that the inheritance paid off the last of the mortgage, now it's for the initial deposit.

Only solution I see is finding a girl with a similar salary and savings habit. Or rich. Might aswell play the lottery then :/

It's a good thing I don't care about downvotes, because I'm about to get a shit ton of them...let me clear up a few things first
1) yes, I am a Spurs fan 2) yes, Bale is my favorite player 3) I was watching this game live

so, now, my case...yes, while watching this gif it looks like Bale takes an egregious dive, and I'm not inside his head, so that very well might have been the case. However, I would pay good money to see what any one of you would do while running full speed (which for Bale, is quite fuckin fast) and out of the corner of your eye, see the keeper running full speed at you, winding up like he's about to kick the piss out of the ball, which your strong foot is about 2 inches away from...Again, it very well could have been a straight dive, but for me personally, it looks like Bale touches it forward and tries to take evasive action as to not get destroyed by the keeper and I think there are two things that support this argument...

1) After Bale slid down, he laid there for a second, kind of like, wow, I just fucked up (which in all fairness, could be about the dive also)

2) he never once looked at the referee for any type of call...he knew there was no contact

Both parents work now to achieve the sort of lifestyle that was available with a single parent working in the past.

Second, businesses are now more optimised financially but in the process have moved away from supporting community and being a part of the building of community.

Mass transit systems for every major city, integrated into regional networks.

The biggest issue for me is not only that he gives the ball away so often, it is that he no longer seems to be much of an attacking threat. I mean, today was the first shot from outside the box I have seen from him in ages. I was actually surprised. 

If you look at Jonjos 2nd goal against Young Boys or Sahins 2nd against West Brom, both Jonjo and Suso were playing in the Gerrard position, they picked up the ball in midfield and drove forward, I can't remember the last time Gerrard has done something like that. We absolutely need someone who can consistently linkup the midfield and attack. When Gerrard plays poorly, as he did today, the whole team suffers tremendously.

true,NotMud,null,null,"Evening guys, nice one for picking the UK. Hope it isn't too shitty! Anyway I had a few thoughts after reading your post:

1. An hour and a half from Dover to central London is optimistic. Getting off the ferry takes about six years and you'll be in a huge traffic jam of ~~lorries~~ trucks all going at an EU-mandated 56mph. Up a hill.
2. I thought you wanted to do Dover and Leeds Castle anyway? What time does the ferry arrive? You might as well do Dover Castle as soon as you can, then take a leisurely cruise up to Leeds Castle on our esteemed M20. Although if you wanted to spend some time in Kent, a visit to Canterbury or Whitstable or [Sandwich](http://s0.geograph.org.uk/geophotos/01/98/31/1983152_0a7b3fd7.jpg) or something would probably be enjoyable. 
3. Where are you going to park in London? I'd almost - almost - recommend you drove straight to Windsor or somewhere outside the city and got the train in. Navigating central London is a huge kerfuffle and parking is likely to cost you a huge number of pounds.
4. Stonehenge is on a road called the A303, which I guess is like your Route 66 but with middle-aged Caravan Club members in sensible Skodas rather than devil-may-care free spirits on Harleys. You will learn to hate this road.
5. In London, visit a bar called the Euston Tap. It's right near Euston railway station. In fact it's two bars, one on each side of the road in some old-fashioned gatehouse things. One does cider, the other does beer.
6. Drive through the Cotswolds. *Quaint as fuck.*
7. Talk of the town at the moment is a chap called Jimmy Savile, who was a popular children's entertainer for several decades. Rumours have always been rife about his penchant for younger ladies but people are starting to take them seriously now. Basically brace yourselves for some particularly graphic stories in our epic but inherently conflicted media.
8. Drink-driving is a big no-no in the UK. There's no 'just over' or walking along the dotted line, they just take your keys away and put you in a cell overnight. This shouldn't affect your plans but its worth bearing in mind the difference in attitudes towards this sort of thing.
9. If you can, go to Brighton. It's seedy, it's dirty, it's completely bizarre, but you'll have an awesome time and, provided you use protection, won't regret it. The Pavilion is a good-looking building (Hitler told ze Germans not to bomb it because he wanted it as his HQ if he invaded England) and the nightlife is feral.
10. You can go into the WW2 bunkers in Dover. The south east was a big part of the war so there's quite a lot of history available if you fancy it.

Not sure where I'm going with this. It's late and I'm going to bed. I'd invite you fellows over for some tea and cake but I'm going to be out all day. Hope the trip goes well, keep us updated on here and maybe somebody will buy you a pint.

   * investment in power plants carbon capture technology (we aren't going to be able to meet all our demand from renewables)
   * High speed broadband, especially to rural areas which wouldn't otherwise get it.

We also need

   * Better public transport. This means longer, more frequent trains, upgrades to allow double-decker trains (might be difficult because the loading gauge is too small at the moment).
   * This doesn't mean more high speed rail, what we need is more capacity on shorter routes.

Also, we should invest in developing longer term solutions:

   * Driverless vehicles
   * Integrated transport
   * Nuclear power plants (these take a long time to build).
   * Research into alternative fusion projects (not just ITER)
   * Encourage telecommuting

Also, we need to rebalance the economy away from the south east.

   * Regional development centred around Universities. We need to develop regional technology clusters where talented workers will move to, in the same way we have with Oxford, Cambridge. Universities are a natural place to start because graduates often tend to stay in the area, and they are a draw for business.
   * This should be tied in with tax incentives to start up businesses in these areas and create jobs.
   * Also changes to planning laws to allow redevelopment and regeneration of existing housing.

Also, we need to consider not just big projects like railways and bridges, but also smaller ""social infrastructure"". Community institutions such as churches, post offices, pubs, community centres have been left to whither for too long. We need to invest in our local communities, and address the reasons for this.

Also filling stations might go bust, because all charging will be done at central points. Not to mention, there will probably be fewer vehicles overall due to a systemic efficiency gain.

The remaining hurdles seem to be mostly miniaturisation and legislative. Miniaturisation probably won't take that long. Then there is the practical matter of actual deployment, and consumer acceptance.

As to affordability, nobody is ever going to buy these things and they won't be sold to consumers. The model for these vehicles is clearly going to be a rental model where they will either be for hire like taxis or you will be billed monthly, or maybe pay with oystercards or some such. The business model means that they don't have to meet the same criteria for affordability as a normal car or taxi service, they can be more expensive but still turn a profit because no driver is needed.

I think within 5 years we could be in small-scale deployment phase where they are available in a small number of cities around the world. Maybe 10 to 15 years they will be widely available in a number of major cities.

There is a huge benefit to using hydroponics for growing anything vegetative. You get more, better crops, without the use of pesticides of herbicides, much fast. I don't know  for certain what area would be needed, but I wouldn't be surprised if all of the fruit and vegetables that are consumed by humans in the UK could be grown over an area around that of a medium sized town. 

See [here](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1025689/Welcome-Thanet-Earth-The-biggest-greenhouse-Britain-unveiled.html) for an example.

As for power, I'd say re-start the coal mines. I know its a dirty word, but it makes a lot of sense to use it again. The latest generation of coal power stations are amazingly clean and [efficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avedøre_Power_Station), and are, afaik, the cheapest power plants to build. The UK still has a reasonable amount of coal left in the ground, so why don't we use it? While it won't be a popular job, opening up the mines again will be a job creator as well. The final advantage to making a new coal power station or two is that the hot carbon Di-oxide filled gas can be pumped into the hydroponic greenhouses, which will reduce the heating needed for them, and increase the productivity of the plants. 
Once a good, reliable alternative source of power has been found (hydrogen or fusion, for example). The coal can be stopped again. 

Essentially I'd try and make the UK self reliant again. Its a good trait to have in country. ",0,1349652357,null,0,false,0,c6j3j8k,t3_113ncg,t1_c6j3j8k,t3_113ncg,null,1430089437,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Health, NHS as is although I would nationalise the medeicine patents, and put that savings into UK based medical R&amp;D. I would create a annexed NHS BUPA like service, with equal level of care as the NHS, but with added pot plants and a butler that snobbish UK residents and health tourists can pay for themselves, with profits put back into raising the base care standards.

Biggest change though would be to R&amp;D, the culture that we have in the UK is the best in the world at creating people who are the most innovate, free thinking and open to new ideas. So I would make this leading attribute of Brits the primary focus of the economy, firstly with govt funded research to be at the minimum 10% of GPD, and a change to patent laws so any efficiency gain / new industries that can be created based on the idea in a patent. This patent would be free for use by any UK citizen as under national ownership, The inventor of the idea will be paid upfront a years worth of what gain the patent gives, with no bringing to market / patenting cost to them. Inventors will be paid to invent not to on their capacity to run a business.

I'd have to disagree with that theory. In Blink (since there are too many people being sent back to get to), Kathy Nightingale got sent back and died about twenty years before the day she got sent back. Billy Shipton got sent back to 1969 yet lived a couple hours after the time he got sent back. The Doctor and Martha also got sent back to 1969; the Doctor says it was probably the same angel that touched them which is why they ended up in the same year. 

As to what could happen if Captain Jack was touched. I personally think it would kill the angel (queue stone angel exploding). Like how Jack killed Abbadon in Torchwood: End of Days. He basically 'overfeeds' them. **OR** Since the angels live off the potential energy of what you could have done if you were not sent back, and since Jack lives indefinitely, he can still accomplish w/e he would've done if he were not sent back meaning there is no potential energy for the angel to feed off, starving them.",0,1349666242,null,0,false,0,c6j6y1g,t3_113zvi,t1_c6j6y1g,t3_113zvi,null,1430091114,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

true,phishsticker,lfc68,,"I don't think Torres' problem is his form. It is his inability to adapt to losing his speed. After that long injury layoff he had, he was never the same afterwards. He had been declining in form since the end of the 08-09 season and has not improved at all since. 

He used to rely on his change of pace and insane finishing ability. When you have a long spell on the sidelines due to injury and recuperation such as he went through, it is very difficult to get back to your pre-injury form. I don't believe the ""form is temporary, class is permanent"" line. Your body can only handle so much. Having surgery on an injury and a long layoff afterwards can really cause massive issues. Some players can handle it, some players cant. Things that used to be 2nd nature suddenly no longer are. Your body does not react to how you are used to and if you can't accommodate for these changes then you won't come close to the level you previously played at. I'm not saying Torres is a bad striker nowadays, he is just no longer that top 5 in the world striker we used to know. I personally would not rate him in my top 20 at this point. I think people expect him to just re-sign for Liverpool and suddenly become the same player he used to be, which will never happen as much as I wish it would.

&gt; It never made sense to me that the question was ""Docor Who?"". People have been asking that all throughout the series. It was the most obvious thing in the world! Was it just for affect?

It was said it was hidden in plain sight. 

&gt; Why must it never be answered?

This we don't actually know, yet. The Doctor does though and with a little foreshadowing by Dorium, we know it will be addressed in the future on the Fields of Trenzalore.

&gt; Is the answer his name?

Will be addressed in the future. It seems like his name would be the most likely answer since this season deals with everyone forgetting the Doctor's reputation throughout the universe. It was however speculated that depending on where the emphasis lies, it could be a totally different question. 'Doctor, who?' In the context that the Doctor must choose someone, etc.

&gt; Will more be uncovered on this topic in the future?

Yes. Highly likely. When Moffat puts something like this out there in plain sight, it will be an important detail in a future story arc. Doctor Who has a reputation of leaving clues and details throughout the episodes leading up to the finale which makes you go, for example: 'OH! So that's what that Bad Wolf graffiti meant!'

&gt; And lastly, what the f*** did the silence have to do with the question?

The Silence, the religious order, believe that the question must never be answered, and 'Silence will fall.' Silence MUST fall is a better translation.

I can give a perfectly good example. Occupy Wall Street. At one point they were simply ""student group peacefully protesting against evils of capitalism"". Then on one dreary night they became ""protesters actively suppressed by police forces"" and suddenly they had this sort of moral high ground.

I don't think that *every* episode needs to be a two-parter - in fact I think Dinosaurs was great as a one off episode and had it been extended, it likely would have been worse off. However 'The Angels Take Manhattan' and 'The Power of Three' would have been **significantly** had they been two-parters.

I would argue that 'The Power of Three' wasn't a particularly great episode because of the poor execution of the last 15 minutes.
