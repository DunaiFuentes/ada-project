Must be just me, but even if someone did do bad acts all their life, I still believe that you can't justify hurting them physically, emotionally, whatever. It still isn't right, and you torturing someone or whatever can't be justified in my opinion saying ""Oh, it's ok, they killed 50 people in their lifetime, therefore I have the right to hurt them"".
&gt;You're obviously oblivious to the fact that there are people above the artic circle who live in perpetual daylight for months at a time.

Would you feel prepared to go from your climate where you have day for say, 12 hours and night for 12 hours, to conditions where the light's constantly on for 24 hours a day, every day?

I'll be honest with you, I know about it but not how they manage with it. Firstly they would be used to it I'm sure, more so than someone from the equator would be going straight up there. Secondly, I'm sure that those who have to live in conditions of 24 hour light for many months at a time don't just try and sleep in the path of the sun, but actually have material to help make it slightly darker should they be in tents. 

It doesn't sound like Mr Tappin has that choice, from what I've heard it sounds like he is forced to stay in his cell for 23 hours a day, with no chance of being in darkness from the light being on 24 hours a day, and under what I believe a cell would look like in his case (probably just a bare room or something similar), I can't see he'll have any way to dim the light for him. Can't forget that he's got absolutely nothing to do there, which these people in the arctic circle or wherever will.

All this adds up psychologically on him. I'm sure you'll agree that you wouldn't want to be in those conditions? Lights on 24 hours a day, stuck in the same cell for 23 hours of the day, given nothing to do but stay there with your thoughts.

There is definitely a significant change in styles styles - keep in mind the head writer changed from Season 4 to Season 5 from Russel T Davies (RTD) to Steven Moffat. It helped me to just take a step back and take a break. A lot of things changed with season 5 so it helps to just clear your head and approach with a new perspective and set of expectations.

I assume that there are just more creative liberties being taken with the new doctor and try to focus on the strengths of the new style like how whimsical the characters are.

I don't see any reason you can't be an artist.  Just get a blank book and draw, draw, draw.  Just like with writing, a lot of it will be crap at first, but you'll get better.  Try drawing what you see around you, even if it's just a glass or a garbage pail.  Go to modern galleries and have a look at what other artists are doing.  Sign up for a class or two.  Pay attention to the ""tricks"" you see comic book and advertising artists use over and over.  Buy a book called ""Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"" and you'll learn why whoever it was who told you that you can't draw was being an idiot. 

Sometimes when people tell you that you can't do something, they're right.  I can't be a pilot because my eyes are terrible.  Heck, I can't even get a driver's license!  But art is something absolutely anyone can do, and even if you specifically want to draw realistically, there's still no reason you can't.  You just need to practice!

This laptop was seized in order to collect drug-dealing related evidence, I believe, so maybe this is treated differently to child porn.

The approach still seems absurd, though. It's perfectly possible to collect all data from a hard disk and store it separately, and this *should* be done anyway, to avoid the risk that the evidence will be lost. And it is perfectly possible to remove that data unrecoverably from the HDD.

In general I have little sympathy for people who don't keep backups, but nevertheless we potentially have a case where the law is punishing innocent people who have reported an incident by destroying both their hardware and their personal data - and of course if this really is the police policy, they would no doubt seize and destroy any backups too.

To some people, the loss of data is trivial. To others, it's extremely significant. If you seized all my hard drives, flash drives and DVD-Rs, you'd be seizing (among other things) a programming project that I've spent more than 10 years on, if you include all the underlying libraries. And the threat of this destruction seems like a great way to motivate people to *NOT* report things like this.

If someone painted child-porn graffiti on your house, or on your car, would the police destroy those too? If not, why are hard disks and personal data treated differently?

 I still have no idea why Henderson is started on the right, he never plays well there, yet always starts there. Kuyt really isnt any better in that position as he lacks pace and skill, he should be a substitute for either Carroll or Suarez. Both Kelly and Skrtel played brilliantly.

true,WarPhalange,null,null,"&gt;It was when Rory was a robot, so chalk it up to freaky robot strength maybe?

Nah, the metal itself wasn't sharp enough. It would have just bent. Think about it, regular bullets can pierce through metal armor, which is why we stopped wearing it. Only Kevlar can provide *some* protection. And bullets haven't been able to hurt Cybermen. And, since armor used to be popular, it means that it was resistant against swords. I thought maybe Rory had some sort of weird vibrosword from the future. It might still be that it was some weird sword provided for the plastic Romans, but it's never elaborated.

&gt;I'd argue that's not really a 'plot hole' b/c they stuck with the conceit later for Rory - ""humans are so human that even a fake human can be a human if they want it bad enough."" So yeah, maybe you buy it, maybe not, but they established it and then kept it consistent at least.

Nope. Rory became human when the time cracks healed and everything went back to normal. The *memory* of Rory somehow jumped from human to plastic man to human, but he never *became* human after being a plastic man.

&gt;So again, whatever, maybe you buy it, maybe you don't, but it's not really a 'plot hole' - they establish it well in advance and then follow through.

Yeah, but this just seems like ""magic"" at this point. Even Rose swallowing the Tardis seemed to be a better explanation.

&gt;Okay, so Vampires of Venice wasn't exactly the high point of the season, I'll give you that.

I win! Hooray!

Episodes that were also not exactly high points of the season:

**The Space Whale**. What the fuck? The whole thing is just bizarre. Other countries also blasted off into space. Did they not have engines either?

**Winston Churchill**. Okay, Churchill, a man determined to acquire the Tardis and use Daleks to win the war, wrote absolutely nothing on either subject, nor even his robot scientist, afterwards? The total silence is baffling. I thought it would be explained away the same way the giant Cyberking was explained, but it *wasn't*. It was just left dangling.

**The Van Gogh Episode**. The episode itself maybe wasn't too bad, but I'm just growing bored of the ""horror"" episodes that have a mythical creature (or monster) running around causing havoc only to have it predictably turn out to be some form of alien life. We've had this with ghosts, werewolves, vampires, even fucking *Satan*. So maybe this is just me not liking it anymore.

**The Drill Episode**. Just bland all around. I especially didn't think it was very in character for The Doctor to tell Woman (forget their names sorry) to take the guns back. There are so many other things he could have said, but it just came out like a forced way to create conflict. #9 was ready to use a gun and didn't mind other people using guns against the Dalek. #10 used a pistol in the end and didn't tell the soliders to put their guns away. This just sounded so weird.

Anyway, not to sound like a Negative Nancy, here are the episodes I DID like:

**The Angels Episodes**. Yes, even though they are the ""horror"" episodes I generally dislike, I think they were handled very well and the reason they are downright scary is because a person's natural response to a scary situation is to look away. Here you are FORCED to face your fears, which makes it worse. Just a great villain design.

**Amy's Choice** (the dream one) was hilarious. I started liking Rory a lot more after that episode.

**The Lodger** (Doctor rents a room) was pretty funny as well.

**Last Episode of Season 5** was pretty good. I always like it when time travel is handled well, and that's what happened here. Though I couldn't care less about the conflict. Sorry, I just didn't really care what happened. I just thought the time jumps were handled well.",0,1331679579,null,0,false,0,c40q7u4,t3_qv48k,t1_c40q7u4,t1_c40pv3t,null,1428520537,-6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,-6

Secondly ... there was no attempt to protect copyright, ... Richard O’Dwyer knew materials were subject to copyright and actively taunted already cited efforts in June 2010 to seize TVShack.net.

&gt; Accordingly [the prosecution] argues ... “O’Dwyer would not be able to avail
himself of the “mere conduit” defence enumerated in Regulation 17 because he was
intimately involved in deciding who was allowed to post links on the TVShack
websites, which links would be posted...” (etc) &amp; “... a plain
reading of the phrase “make available” in this context makes clear O’Dwyer “made
available copyrighted material”. HHJ Ticehurst ... in Rock &amp; Overton held
“make available should bear its ordinary and natural meaning”. ...

&gt; I have endeavoured to weigh these subtle distinctions. The diagrams of how as a
matter of electronic mechanics (if I may term it) the TVShack websites actually
operated favour HHJ Ticehurst’s restrictive construction. To my mind there is much
in the distinction factually, always remembering these matters are allegations of
conduct which a trial court alone can resolve – that [the prosecution] contends between the
instant matter and Rock &amp; Overton. I also have in mind the mischief Parliament had
in mind. Accordingly in my judgement I am satisfied the conduct alleged in the
instant request meets the dual criminality test and would be an offence in this
jurisdiction.

true,SEMW,null,null,"&gt; if the statistics for flying deaths were identical to what they are now, but all of the other modes of transport were significantly safer, would you still consider fear of flying to be irrational? I think probably not.

On that point particularly: no, I still would. The reduction in risk of death from *never* flying *in your entire life* (+[0.9](http://orbitingfrog.com/post/3424320913/danger-risk-of-death) micromorts) would be more than cancelled out by, for example, drinking 2/3 of a bottle of wine *once* (-1micromort from liver cirrhosis). Pretty much any activity you do at home beyond sitting perfectly still doing nothing at all will be more dangerous per unit time than flying.

On the general point, I am using 'irrational' not as a pejorative, but purely descriptively, to indicate that some emotion, instinct, etc. is unjustified by the facts. Which is most of the time, for everyone, including me - emotions almost by defintion tend to not be rational, and to say that is certainly not me insulting emotion.  

(Which is also not to say that the fact that we *have* the instincts is irrational (they're there for an evolutionarily good reason), only that they can give a disproportionate response when confronted with a situation that our minds aren't very good at grasping the risk level of instinctually, like flying). 

So I'm not 'dismis[ing] them as irrational just because they're not supported by the numbers'; I'm using 'irrational' pretty much as a shorter way of saying 'not supported by the numbers'.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; The fact is I voted specifically for the Tory party to get Gordon Brown out of office. He was an utter UTTER disaster. But that's why I did it. No more, no less.

I make part of my living from trading, gold mainly - and Mr Brown (again in my opinion) should be in jail for first of all selling all the UK gold about 4 weeks from it's all time low in 2001 - **and** because he telegraphed it to all his investment bank buddies... (Rothschilds et al, [London corporation](http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation) *hint, it might have a .govt.uk url, but isn't 'govt' in any democratically elected way...)) 

Ironically, I voted (for the final time ever) for Tony Blair to get rid of the tories. Looks like we both ('might' in your case, but definitely in my case) regret those decisions.

&gt; It seems that anyone who gets a wiff of power becomes corrupt.

I agree completely and numerous psychological studies back it up. A problem without a solution is just that though... the only solution I have currently is 'direct democracy'. Dump the role of politician and have bureaucrats who are audited and chosen meritocratically, i.e. have relevant experience in the field and are fired if corruption is found. They then carry out the will of the people - which is transparent, simple and straight forward really. 

It means a lot more education and voting by the populace, but it's a small price to pay for a much greater degree of transparency and mitigated corruption. The only failing in that, is that there are a lot of badly educated ~~ignorant/stupid~~ people who vote without thinking (or not at all), so the education and media system needs to be changed to ensure everyone becoming or is an adult, knows their educational responsibilities in relation to direct democracy.

I know, good luck with that... My only answer was to emigrate, which improved things, but it's getting as bad here now (NZ).

I'm not saying that every single episode under RTD's run was a shining jewel, but even in the bad episodes there was more emphasis on internal consistency and having the characters behave halfway intelligently, no matter how weird the situation was.  And this goes double for Moffat's own scripts.  I have to imagine that RTD was using a *lot* of editorial control to keep Moffat's good ideas while tossing out the bad ones.  

Like Blink.  Blink was a **brilliant** script, probably the best of the entire new series.  Yet when the Weeping Angels return, suddenly the script is just something out of a bad horror movie, with them constantly making up new powers for the Angels, breaking previous rules for them, and having characters wander off alone in search of the proverbial cat *all the time*, no matter how blatantly stupid it is in context.

And a lot of it is just a feeling like the writers really are just making everything up as they go along, and using cheap tricks and retcons to try to make it all hang together.  Like the whole Rory situation.  Did the whole 2,000 year wait happen or not?  Ostensibly that reality was destroyed, but at the same time, he kept all of his fighting skills from the Roman days.  Yet his personality didn't change one bit, as one might expect for a being who's now arguably older than the Doctor himself.  It's a constant feeling like they want to have their cake and eat it too.

When we examine the function of the teselecta it seems quite obvious that it can pull of this light show. Recall that the teselecta can transform into anyone in the universe. Now we can We reasonably say (in the scope of the Doctor Who universe at least) that there may well be some race of glowing or gaseous like aliens that the teselecta could want to shapeshift into, or at the very least there is glowing and/or gaseous clothing or something of that nature that something the teselecta might want to shapeshift into might be wearing. Therefore we could reasonably assume that the teselecta could apply these effects to the doctor's form. T

The doctor asks the teselecta to go to Lake Silencio knowing that this is were he is supposed to die (and be ""killed"" by River). The teselecta need only scan the doctor, figure out the light show, perhaps which the doctor programs in the teselecta.

OTOH, the overarcing plot of Season 6 unfortunately just doesn't make any damn sense when viewed in hindsight.  However, I think even Moffat realizes they over-reached there.  He's been pretty public in saying that S7 is going to be more stand-alone episodes and less serialization.  I seem to remember reading somewhere that he's not even planning on having any two-parters, unless they just happen to get a story they love that they can't cram into 45 minutes.

Unfortunately, I will say that, if anything, the River Song problems just get worse.  They continue to make her story increasingly complicated and implausible and, worse to my mind, they STILL haven't shown even a single episode where she and the Doctor are this great loving couple that she keeps acting like they were\will be sometime.

It must have been of the kind that knocks down a single building leaving everything else unscathed. Lovely. (I know you see what I mean) 

&gt; This I take to just be The Doctor's brand of arrogance. After all, if he really knew everything he wouldn't feel the need to travel to see things.

But then again, this very series we are told he knows *everything:* ”Rose: I can see everything. All that is, all that was, all that ever could be. The Doctor: That's what I see. All the time. And doesn't it drive you mad?”

&gt; lot of these things just don't seem to bug me as much as stabbing a Cyberman with an iron sword or redirecting sunlight (during a storm) with a pocket mirror from 20 feet away to explode a vampire thing that's already out in broad daylight, though.

Come on, the whole fight against Francesco is at most, comic relief. Should we mention too that he seems to use a sword that is part of a perception field cloak? As I said, that scene is there for giggles.
About the Cyberman, it can even be explained in–show: we never see the actual hit, Rory could have stabbed him where the armour was damaged.

&gt;There are plotholes of the ""we don't know everything"" variety like the rift under the TARDIS, 

Or, using their proper name, “atrocious writing” plot holes.

He can be jolly and caring, but push the wrong buttons and you can drive him to genocide.

* He seems to have an unlimited source of knowledge about anything and everything... which makes it all the more troubling when there is something  wrong that he can't explain.

* No matter the enemy, he is almost never scared. He's faced down the most dangerous races known in the universe... and doesn't back down. Again, this makes it all the more worrying when he IS scared.

* His character is so old, so well known-of... yet still so mysterious. Hell, we don't know his name, the fate of his family, much of his past pre-1st Doctor. The mystery adds to his appeal.

* My favourite- his ability to almost-always get the job done without a weapon.  ",0,1331704049,null,0,false,0,c40uiqg,t3_qvs1d,t1_c40uiqg,t3_qvs1d,null,1428522535,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

I tried to justify this in a number of ways, like ""he isn't using the TARDIS, he's using the time wristband thing"" but the only explanation I got was ""well the universe was ending anyway,"" in one of the later episodes.

Blink was a fantastic episode, but truthfully, the idea of the Angels probably wouldn't be so scary if they didn't actually kill people (instead of just sending them back in time).

As far as Rory goes, the personality is just a quirk. They could not change that without compromising the whole character - arguably, he is much braver now than he was before.

true,APeacefulWarrior,null,null,"Well, your first point is actually one that doesn't bother me.  The whole thing about not crossing one's own timeline, from what I understand, was more of a Law of the Time Lords than a Law of the Universe.  I see that as following on the heels of Ten's personal revelations in ""The Waters of Mars"" and ""The End of Time,"" that he really isn't required to play by Time Lord rules any more.  Even though those rules are obviously there to prevent horrible paradoxes and reality-shredding that *could* result from polluting one's own timeline.

HOWEVER, I think Moffat's crew takes that way too far.  One thing that irritates me about the Eleventh Doctor and\or the writing (depending on how meta you want to be) is a massively increased willingness to screw around with the timeline, even events that should be considered fixed.  He just doesn't seem to care much at all about keeping the timeline straight, although every time he bungs something up, the writers just destroy that reality and bring in a new one.

I couldn't help but imagine, for example, a more realistic ending to ""Vincent and the Doctor"" would have involved them returning to the future and discovering Vincent's exhibition had been replaced by a Monet exhibit.  It just turns out that telling someone that they're going to be world-famous one day is a good way to screw that up completely. 

Also, I think that (in terms of writing) a stable time loop is a nice game to play *occasionally*, and usually in isolation as they did in Blink.  But I think the current writers rely on it way too often as a cheap trick of a plot device.  River Song, for example, deliberately leaving a message for the Doctor to see years in the future so that he'll come back in time and rescue her at just the right moment felt more like something that belongs in Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure.

true,Awesomeade,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"It'd add an interesting dynamic to the Doctor-River relationship, that's for sure.

Here's how I would bring her back:

Firstly, it would have to be made clear to the viewer who exactly the Jenny is to avoid confusion. I think a good way to achieve this would be to have the episode begin with her backed into a corner and in real trouble. Coolest scenario I can think of would be for the cybermen to have captured her, planning to turn her into a timelord cyber-controller (which would be fucking crazy intense IMO). Right before assimilation, her life flashes before her eyes, and here is where we get to see her history with the Doctor via emotional flashback.

Just as assimilation is beginning, we cut from a screaming Jenny to the Doctor and River in the Tardis. The Doctor (stressed about nearing the end of his time with River?) is preparing to depart on a nice, quiet date with his young and rambunctious bride-to-be. Excitement-seeking River is reluctant, but the Doctor insists, and they exit the Tardis. Little does he know, his peaceful date is in very close proximity to the very place where the cybermen are about to assimilate his daughter!!!!! (This is made clear to the viewer through small passing comments in the dialogue.)

Cut back to Jenny. Assimilation is beginning, she's at the end of her rope, and just as all hope appears lost, she enters a regeneration cycle. The burst of energy allows her to break free from her binds, and stuns the cybermen just enough for her in her new body (confused, as she has no idea what happened) to make an escape. As she's running there's a large explosion, and we cut to the Doctor and River on their date.

The two are sitting outdoors on a hillside (which overlooks an expansive field and distant mountains or something) and enjoying a quiet picnic. River is pouting, and the Doctor is trying to talk up the situation. The Doctor says something along the lines of, ""This is nice isn't it? It's quiet! It's peaceful! It's beautiful!! And, most importantly, there's nothing for light years to interrupt our date!"" Cue explosion in the distance. The Doctor's exhibits and expression of hopeless frustration, as River begs to investigate. The Doctor concedes, and unknowingly sets off towards his daughter.

Cut back to Jenny on the cyber-base, mounting her escape. Excitement ensues, and eventually she finds her way out into the open field. In the distance, she makes out two figures, and makes her way towards them with loads of cyber-shit in pursuit.

Cut back to the Doctor and River. They can barely make out a figure running towards them, and upon closer inspection, they realize it is being pursued by a small cyber-army. The Doctor is dumbfounded that he could have been oblivious to such a large concentration of cybermen, and River is ecstatic and raring to go. They converge, with the Doctor and Jenny completely oblivious to each other's identity what with the new bodies. So ensues an awesome action sequence of flawless timelord teamwork, and the three barely manage to escape the cyber-onslaught in tact. They weren't able to make it back to the Tardis, but they were able to shake the cybermen temporarily (the rest of the episode would likely be about the timelord family investigating the massive cyber-hideout that the Doctor knew nothing about, which he finds incredibly strange and troublesome). It is here that the introductions are made:
    
    The Doctor: ""Blah blah blah, this is River, and I'm the Doctor.""
    Jenny: *Expression of shock followed by pure joy*
    Jenny: ""Daddy!!!!""
    *So ensues a big timelordy father-daughter hug*
    River: *I'm gonna kill him*
    Doctor: *FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU*

As far as their new abilities, I think most of them are just things that weren't explored in *Blink*-nothing ""held the image of an Angel"" in *Blink*, so that wasn't a problem.  Sally may very well have looked into an Angel's eyes, but Amy's countdown was again mainly a tactic to psych out the Doctor.  I'm not sure what your second ""ability"" (more Angels that don't even look like Angels) is referring to, unless its the ""twist ending"" statues that aren't actually statues but Angels.  If that's what you were talking about, those were Angels all along; they just hadn't fed in a very long time and were starting to ""decay"".

Other than the feeding vs. killing thing, the only explicit difference between the *Blink* Angels and the *Time of the Angels* Angels is their movement-in *Blink* you never saw them move, while in TOTA they moved slowly while Amy pretended to not-blindly walk through them.  As far as I can tell, that's the only canon-busting change, as in *Blink* their quantum state was based on whether they were observed or not, not whether they *knew* they were observed.

Note: I'm tired and a bit drunk, so if I made any mistakes/misinterpreted anything, please feel free to correct or question me.

The long and short of it is that a lot of the extra voters that the Lib Dems picked up this last time were either people who usually voted Labour but were unwilling to vote for a labour government with Gordon Brown still at the head, or people who *would* have voted Lib Dem in past elections but instead usually voted Labour strategically and only voted Lib Dem this time because they (at the time of election) looked like they may actually get a decent number of seats to be able to be a sensible voice as a third party. 

Instead the first action they make is to jump into bed with the party that I'd only vote for if my two other choices were the BNP or a gunshot wound to the head.

The number is recorded, but rarely spoken about because it's small, and there are obviously more interesting things to discuss from the election. But say it get up to 5 or 6%, that's enough for the question to be asked as to why this has risen sharply. I think it would probaly have to happen for at least two elections in a row for it not to be an anomaly.

I'd argue that if you're willing the make the (admittedly minimal) effort to go to a polling station, and if you've made the effort to read the policies of the parties (partisan voters rarely do, but they are a diminishing number), then you're smart enough to tick a box, which would explain the almost insignificant number of spoilt ballots right now. The simple fact is that it takes longer and a lot more effort to spoil a ballot than to not vote, so a sharp rise would show that people want to register their discontent in a simple but direct way.

At the last election, 34.9% of people didn't vote. In the last 20yrs, the lowest amount of non-voting people was 22.3% (1992). Politicians won't target non-voters, because it's a waste of money, time and policy that can be used to attract non-partisan voters. For the politicians, it makes it easier to have a shrinking turnout as there are less people to focus on getting votes from. This is why few policies are targeted to improve the lives of under 28's. 
I both agree and disagree that failure to vote undermines the winner. True, it means that a smaller proportion of people voted for them, but then this applies to the losers, too. But does it undermine? I don't necessarily agree with this word, but I can't think of a better one. If the people don't care about politics anyway, is it undermining them? Surely those that are politically aware showing their discontent with a spoilt ballot would be more significant, because these are the people that are targeted.

At the last election, I voted for who I believed was the least worst party, which is a choice many of my friends took. But this gave them a mandate to rule, because a reluctant vote is still a vote. Had I not voted, it wouldn't have mattered, because I'd just be another part of that 34.9%. The only protest I would have had, and indeed that I have now, is to show that I'm politically aware but I don't like any candidate.

There are holes in my argument, I fully accept that, but when you have limited ways to protest vote, and when we live in a time of statistics being supreme in politics, the aim has to be that you are aware but pissed off.",0,1331721415,null,0,false,0,c40w3z1,t3_qv5th,t1_c40w3z1,t1_c40tg1o,null,1428523344,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

The UK has never had to show a prima facie case, even under the 1870 Act I believe. In fact, under old extradition arrangements it was the US who had to show that. Instead, the UK has always had to show probable cause, whereas the US has to show reasonable suspicion.

Baker report uses 

&gt;1.20 We have concluded that the United States/United Kingdom Treaty does not operate in 
an unbalanced manner.  The United States and the United Kingdom have similar but 
different legal systems.  In the United States the Fourth Amendment to the 
Constitution ensures that arrest may only lawfully take place if the probable cause test 
is satisfied: in the United Kingdom the test is reasonable suspicion.  In each case it is 
necessary to demonstrate to a judge an objective basis for the arrest. 

&gt;1.21 In our opinion, there is no significant difference between the probable cause test and 
the reasonable suspicion test. 

&gt;1.22 In the case of extradition requests submitted by the United States to the United 
Kingdom, the information within the request will satisfy both the probable cause and 
the reasonable suspicion tests. 

&gt;1.23 In the case of extradition requests submitted by the United Kingdom to the United 
States the request will contain information to satisfy the probable cause test. 

&gt;1.24 There is no practical difference between the information submitted to and from the 
United States. 

Evidence from a Court of Appeal judge is super effective!

What is slightly sad is the number of upvotes you have when what you have said is horrendously factually inaccurate. Even disregarding the slightly debatable points (whether or not the tests are equal), you have the certain points wrong (what the tests are).

Tesco has a career average salary pension scheme.  Virtually everyone else who has a final salary pension scheme (which are similar) are scrapping it because it is deemed as too expensive and moving to contribution based schemes.  People joining now and retiring at 65 will be better off in the new Tesco scheme than they would be in a contribution based scheme.  And if they think they aren't, they can opt out and go for a private contribution based scheme.

It also doesn't take away any benefits, because it only applies to benefits accrued after the date it is implemented.  So if you've worked 20 years (up to 60) contributing 1/35th a year, then your additional 7 years at 1/37th would take you to a higher pension than another 5 years at 1/35th under the old scheme.

Anthony Aust, noted international academic:
&gt;A new UK-US Extradition Treaty was signed on 31 March 2003. It is on largely traditional lines, except that an extradition request by the United Kingdom to the United States still has to make a prima facie case, but those by the United States to the United Kingdom will have, in effect, to show *probable cause*. Despite what has been said by US spokespersons, this is a lower threshold^21. Thus the new treaty crease a new principle of double standards.

[citation]
&gt; ^21 Contrast Art. 8(3)(c) with Art. IX of the previous 1972 Extradition Treaty, 1049 UNTS 167 (No. 15811); UKTS (1977) 16; TIAS 8468. The actual wording applicable to requests by the United Kingdom is i section 8(3)(c): 'For requests to the United States such information as would provide a reasonable basis to believe that the person sought committed the offence for which extradition is requested.'

true,yrro,null,null,"In R v Rock &amp; Overton (heard in Gloucester Crown Court), the judge dismissed the charges under the Copyright act. The judge in O'Dwyer's case (in Westminster magistrate's court) said:

&gt; While both counsel acknowledge some uncertainty if Rock &amp; Overton has any binding affect in these proceedings it is clearly persuasive and instructive on the application of S.107 (2A).

And,

&gt; [The defence] argues nothing in the instant Request amounts to a basis for saying Richard O’Dwyer “made available” copyright material that came from remote websites not the two domain names operated by Richard O’Dwyer. Reliance is placed on HHJ Ticehurst’s adopting of [the] approach in the Australian case of Cooper supra. ... [Ticehurst] found “no recordings were actually stored on the defendant’s website” and that, ... “it is the remote websites which make available the sound recordings”, hence [Ticehurst's] upholding of the “mere conduit” defence.

However:

&gt; [The prosecution] stopped short ... of arguing Rock &amp; Overton is wrongly decided although he submits it is overly restrictive. Instead he contends S.107 (2A) is properly reflective of Richard O’Dwyer’s conduct which can be distinguished from Rock &amp; Overton.
&gt; Firstly both TVShack websites were entirely in the hands of Richard O’Dwyer and his co conspirators requiring third parties to sign up to TVShack and be vetted before going further. 
&gt; Secondly he argues, unlike Rock &amp; Overton, there was no attempt to protect copyright, he, Richard O’Dwyer, knew materials were subject to copyright and actively taunted already cited efforts in June 2010 to seize TVShack.net. 

**This is the basis of the two points I highlighted in my previous post in this thread.** I haven't looked at *Rock &amp; Overton* myself, but surely it is these two points that the prosecution argues make the difference between O'Dwyer's case and that other case. The judgement continues:

&gt; Accordingly [the prosecution] argues ... “O’Dwyer would not be able to avail himself of the “mere conduit” defence enumerated in Regulation 17 because he was intimately involved in deciding who was allowed to post links on the TVShack websites, which links would be posted...” (etc) &amp; “... a plain reading of the phrase “make available” in this context makes clear O’Dwyer “made available copyrighted material”.
&gt; ... Ticehurst in Rock &amp; Overton held “make available should bear its ordinary and natural meaning”. He distinguished
between providing money “directly to” another as opposed to a financial adviser who may “point” another to a bank meaning the bank alone “makes available the money”.

Finally, 

&gt; I have endeavoured to weigh these subtle distinctions. The diagrams of how ... the TVShack websites actually operated favour HHJ Ticehurst’s restrictive construction. To my mind there is much in the distinction factually, always remembering these matters are allegations of conduct which a trial court alone can resolve...

i.e., the particulars of *Rock &amp; Overton* are not similar enough to this case to dismiss it at this stage; a trial must be held in order to determine further either way.

Unfortunately I don't have a copy of the book to find out if there is more context. I also can't try to seek out Aust himself to explain the viewpoint to me, apparently he is no longer a visiting lecturer at my faculty. 

For now I am still content to believe a well-researched report on pretty much just this point over a general international law book which appears to mention the treaty in passing.

true,Swiftfooted,eng-northumberland,Geordie in London,"Yeah, I agree, that is how they try to distinguish it. The problem is that this was all in a discussion of what ""made available"" means. You can try to distinguish the cases all you want on various facts, but to properly say that what O'Dwyer is accused of doing was a crime in the UK you need to distinguish it purely on that basis. 

In Rock &amp; Overton Ticehurst uses the example of a financial adviser. I need some money so I go to the adviser who points me in the direction of a bank. No-one would say that that adviser has made available that money. This is analogous to the linking sites and makes perfect sense in interpreting the term.

Now use the distinguishing point and apply it to that common sense metaphor and interpretation. Say I had to sign up and be vetted by the financial adviser before he gave me advice. Is he now making the money available to me? I'd argue that there's no logical distinction to draw here.

The final point, on whether he attempted to protect copyright, is something which again I don't see how it applies to the definition of ""made available"". It doesn't change the fact that O'Dwyer was simply linking to other sites which made the content available.

Perhaps if Purdy had put a bit more effort into the distinction it may be a bit clearer what he was thinking. Without that the decision just reeks of believing *Rock &amp; Overton* to be wrong without wanting to say it is due to confusions over precedent.

Finally, remember that this is the trial to determine either way, at least legally. Assuming the US' facts are correct, what O'Dwyer is accused of having done has to have been a crime in the UK.

I then went on to talk about what happened during the riot, which was that people mindlessly caused havoc and looted for no good reason.

I was trying to back up what I was saying about boredom and a helplessly low social standing being the cause for the riots as, ""why would anyone who was rioting, because police shot a man, go about stealing shoes and rice? They wouldn't, of course. Did you see people in the syrian protests burning shit and looting? There was probably some going on but they were protesting first and foremost. Considering they've got a shitload more to get angry about, you'd expect it to be the other way around.

There's no cure from making your own life so miserable you have to burn down half of london to feel something. Everyone else has a hard time finding work, everyone else has to make their own fun out of life.

bad policing is going to occur, if you can't protest about it in an acceptable manner you'll get no sympathy. It's an excuse because, where are the protests now that the violence is out of their system? where were all the legit protesters during the riot? Stealing fucking rice.

Were the people pissed off beforehand? yes. Were they poor? relatively yes (though none were in absolute poverty). Have those areas been policed more than others, using harsher rules? Yes, because they have always had high crime rates.

Young people in this country are currently being treated like crap as a general rule. We're told to go to uni, then we come out with insane debt, to find that there arent any jobs, and jobs available have crap pay for high work loads. We're ignored by politicians and the general public see us as a nuisance and as spoilt moaners. I have yet to go and smash up a shop and steal. 

Riots happen, it's unfortunate, but you cannot excuse the behaviour of the people. They know what they are doing, and they know the risks they run. If they cannot act like respectful human beings then they run the risk of not being treated like respectful human beings.
There will always be a pissed off lower class and an elite upper class that takes the piss, what we need to do is make it so that as few people get pissed off as possible and that the upper class are limited in how much they can take the piss.

Opportunist thugs would likely riot every afternoon, but lack the cohesive support of an aggrieved mass.

&gt;bad policing is going to occur, if you can't protest about it in an acceptable manner…

It’s hard to know what would be an acceptable yet satisfying way to protest the police’s refusal to give reliable information about their killing of a citizen in contentious circumstances, especially given the rate of prosecutions and convictions of police on previous occasions. 

Marching down the street en masse saying, “this will not do,” seems pretty hollow when judicial process almost always determines that actually, it *will* do perfectly well. An innocent man may have been killed for no good reason^* but, meh, pleece, init.

Whatever; bored people were feeling powerless at the bottom of the ladder before the riots, and still feel that way after the riots, so they were evidently a component, but they couldn’t possibly be *the cause.* If they were, riots would occur every day, or at least every day that the bored, powerless people at the bottom of the ladder weren’t either tired from yesterdays’s rioting or awaiting trial.

Causes may have included innumerable conditions, be they social, economic, political and even weather, but the spark, the ignition for the riots in Tottenham was the action of the police, first in the shooting, then in their handling of the shooting. Without those, there would have been no riots. 

The opportunists, by definition were not a prerequisite. If all the opportunist thugs wanting to wreck and steal from JD Sports, William Hill and passing students had been asleep that Thursday, disorder and riots would almost certainly have still occurred. There would have been less damage, less acquisitive criminality, less harm to innocent bystanders and, probably, a lot less fire. But riots were on the cards. Many people warned the police of that, well ahead of time. The bored, the disaffected and the opportunists certainly were factors, but equally certainly, they were not causes.

I tend to like anarchism over other ideas but I am not married to anything. 

&gt;Tell me a system that has ever been fair and worked, and I'll assure you it didn't exist. 

I don't really understand this. I am interested in how things can be fair and work in the future. I don't know enough about whether something fair and working has existed before. Prior to civilisation some people believe human societies were fair and worked. There is some compelling information about American societies (prior to colonisation) were fair and worked but I don't know how accurate our knowledge is about this. 


&gt;Human nature is greedy, from small things such as wanting a bag of skittles to big things like making millions off kicking people out of homes. 

What is your basis for thinking this is true? I think we've been conditioned to believe this so we behave greedily and so we support the greedy self-serving people at the top of the pile. There are plenty of societies that value generosity and cooperation. It's in your upbringing and the myths you tell and hear. 

&gt;I'm all for equality of oppurtunity, but you shouldnt be held back because while you've worked someone else has done sod all and you have to be equal to them.

Saying this without observing the context within which you say it is meaningless. Why has someone worked and someone else not worked? 

Go back to the enclosure of public lands and look around a bit. I think it is far better to leech off the economy and the state than continue to perpetuate industrial civilisation by playing one's part as a cog in the machine. By working and consuming you are participating in the future suffering of your children and grandchildren. A sloth who gives nothing to anyone is sucking energy out of the system at least. Better still, someone who rejects work and leeches off society but creates art or visits their elderly neighbour is likely contributing more than a cog-person. 

It's all a matter of context and perspective.

When one challenges the emperor/king (@work now so I don't have the vid in front of me and don't remember his specific title), both are allowed to strike the other ONE time with a sword. With the incumbent getting the honor of the first strike. The Emperor knowing this rule of course accepts the challenge and instantly strike the Doctor down, who instantly regenerates due to it being so close to his last regeneration. Thus the Doctor demands his turn to strike the king, the king backs down and flees, promising to never to return to earth again. Only to have Harriet the prime minister blow them out of the sky.

You mention prior to civilisation we likely had equality, but now that we have civilisation surely only its destruction could lead us back to it?

My belief that people are greedy comes from looking at the most simple of places- the animal kingdom and babies. The animal kingdom will often share with its young but not with others, and will fiercely guard what it deems it's own. Looking at babies, they will take something and claim it as theirs. they have to be taught to share, it's not an ability they are born with. Even yourself, I'm sure you have some money in the bank and plenty of food- how often do you go and give some to a homeless person so that they might survive? The instinct is to make sure the individual has enough, then others. This, i believe, partially explains the rise of the environmental movement in the first world- we're safe, so we can focus on green issues.

Some people have a desire to work hard and succeed. My dad is from a mining town, he worked hard and is now a partner in a London law firm. His brother in law had a similar upbringing but did nothing with his life and is a waster. My dad wanted a better life, so worked for it.

The coalition itself is a demonstration - what would the outcome have been if more people had voted instead of (for example) assuming that fingerpointing after the event is just as good? Even if you'd voted for one of the minor parties, a larger vote for them would mean the larger ones would have to acknowledge their issues up to a point. Ultimately, what's that line about good men doing nothing?

Why do so many think he'll eventually be a better CB than an RB? If he continues playing in this position behind Johnson for long enough, could he not develop into the exact type of player so many wish Johnson would be - strong attacker and strong defender?

With Skrtel and Agger being relatively young, as well as Coates being recruited for CB and nothing else, our first team CB set up is incredibly solid. Andre Wisdom in the youth setup looks rather promising as well, so there is a future possible pairing in Coates and Wisdom. At RB, we only have Flanagan and Emmanuel Mendy, but they still slot in behind Kelly and will stay behind Kelly for sometime, in my opinion.

As far as I can see, Kelly is gaining priceless playing experience at RB that differs greatly from the way we play our CBs, and along with the training and mentoring he's undoubtedly receiving from the English national RB we have in Glen Johnson, makes this first XI position Kelly's position to lose.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;what would the outcome have been if more people had voted instead of (for example) assuming that fingerpointing after the event is just as good?

One of the parties would have won - evidence to date is they're all shit.  I voted no to all of them, I don't trust neo-liberals, nor those who appease them.  Let's be honest - Labour offered nothing to socialists, the Lib-Dems kind of pretended to offer something to Social Democrats, but then reneged on it all in office.  The Conservatives hinted at something for Eurosceptics, anti-immigrants and Libertarians but then plotted to sell out all these groups behind the scenes.

&gt;Even if you'd voted for one of the minor parties, a larger vote for them would mean the larger ones would have to acknowledge their issues up to a point. Ultimately, what's that line about good men doing nothing?

I've never done nothing, I just see what happens to small parties when they grow.  Good men (and women) do many things, if they're clever they don't rely on '""representative"" democracy' though...

&gt;So...you're using rape to justify not voting. Nice.

I'm saying not voting is the same as not consenting.

&gt;either you're suggesting that voting for them didn't make any difference or that voting for them did and therefore here we are - you can't have it both ways. If you're taking about votes on reddit, do you usually respond to upvotes in the same way?

Yes, voting up or down - or for this party or that - is broadly speaking not going to change the world.

&gt;what's the point of commenting on a free public board when ultimately your opinion will be dismissed through your preference for pretending your non-vote means nothing anyway?

That's true.  I don't see slacktivism or commenting on message boards as a powerful protest.  But then I'm not putting a party in to power here.  I'm condemning them all.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;You mention prior to civilisation we likely had equality, but now that we have civilisation surely only its destruction could lead us back to it?

I don't know. I assume it's more helpful to think that we can use our knowledge of the past to evolve towards a future that takes the more positive aspects of what has come before. 

I also am pretty sure that civilisation is collapsing right now and no one can do anything about it. It would help if more people were aware of this so we don't get caught with our trousers around our ankles. 

&gt;My belief that people are greedy comes from looking at the most simple of places- the animal kingdom and babies. The animal kingdom will often share with its young but not with others, and will fiercely guard what it deems it's own. Looking at babies, they will take something and claim it as theirs. they have to be taught to share, it's not an ability they are born with. Even yourself, I'm sure you have some money in the bank and plenty of food- how often do you go and give some to a homeless person so that they might survive? The instinct is to make sure the individual has enough, then others. This, i believe, partially explains the rise of the environmental movement in the first world- we're safe, so we can focus on green issues.

I think your belief and view of the animal kingdom (what a strange word to use) is distorted through the cultural lens. I don't know enough about other beings but I think similar creatures to us have complex social arrangements which include cooperation and competition. Look at chimps and bonobos, look at dolphins. Many species cooperate. 

I don't have a solid enough grounding in David Attenborough to know what the general thing is with nature. But I don't think it matters. All that matters is s understanding ourselves. We are able to understand that we are creatures who create our world through our conscious minds. We create our world through mythmaking and storytelling. There is no rational argument for selfishness and competition being natural to us or even superior even if the animal world is all right-wing ""libertarians"". 

The important thing is that if we believe we are masters of our own fate, we get to decide what's best. If you think ""I fuck you, you fuck me"" will make for a decent world for your kids, fine. I hope no one listens to you. 

&gt;Some people have a desire to work hard and succeed. My dad is from a mining town, he worked hard and is now a partner in a London law firm. His brother in law had a similar upbringing but did nothing with his life and is a waster. My dad wanted a better life, so worked for it. Take away that incentive, and what reason do people have to work?

Wow, that's a big question. I will inevitably not satisfy you. Does your dad love lawyering? If not, what possible good is it to anyone? 

If your dad became a lawyer because it meant making money, I understand why he'd do that but I see no virtue whatsoever in it. 

Your question seems to be - if we don't create a situation in which people are coerced to serve as functionaries in the system, what incentive do they have? 

There is no inherent incentive. Working in the system because of fear or greed (are there other reasons for people to pursue financial wealth?) isn't going to uplift society. 

The incentive for people to do stuff should be love of the stuff that they do. We'd all be a great deal happier. 

&gt;A final question, based on your last paragraph, does this mean that you won't get a job? and if you do have a job, what do you do?

I don't have a job, I teach drums. I love doing it. Playing and teaching music is something I would do whether or not I was paid to do it. If I had a place to live and the basics taken care of I would prefer to do stuff without the interference of a business transaction. 

I don't want anything. I already have more than 90% of the world's population at the same time I am at the very lowest income level in England. 

Money is not real, it's just a system that enables a certain power relationship between the lords and the serfs.

Ultimately British troops rolling down the street and policing the airport was enough to lend stability to the city and state workers that normality would ensue.  A battalion of British Paras, with a company on the high street, is apparently enough to say that looting won't happen this time, apparently, and that it is safe to engage normality.  The previous typical UN forces had left the large population centers less than confident.  The British Paras took guardian control of the capital city and the airport with the other UN forces providing security outside the limits, and the city held - this is how the circle was broken.  They themselves were ready for it, and they knew the British troops were of a higher caliber than the previous failed UN forces.  The city workers resumed, as did business, and the new government withstood the rebels.

I have no doubt that a continued UK presence has been determinate in not seeing further military uprising against the other, or even keeping the issue at bay.

Although the vast majority of reconnaissance and patrolling was conducted by other countries, it was the UK that was predominantly called on for actual strikes.

true,ragewind,uk,,"i didnt say sacking!

but a boy in a pool is a wide open space and no where does it mention he was drowning and a threat to himself.

they then left him in a van soaked for 20 mins.

now wet in a pool for an hour is no big deal its heated but in a van in wet cloths could have effected his health considerably.

waiting and just containing the situation while getting either a relative or some better trained medical staff on the scene would have been a safer option, a doctor or even paramedics have better training with mental health patients than the police.

so sacking them would be stupid as they have said the training in this area is shit. the chief should apology's ans stop being a cunt, it would only cost them more in fees than the fine anyway and make them look like ass'es.

they should improve there training but it dose not change the fact the officers acted in a rush without consulting the trained staff who were in the building and probably dealing with the rest of the group to keep the group calm. that was the officers actions not that of training so a reprimand and an apology is whats called for over and done with, all groups happy and in 6 month its forgotten for the officers anyway.",0,1331761489,null,0,false,0,c412nlm,t3_qw233,t1_c412nlm,t1_c4120o5,null,1428526420,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,MooMorris,null,null,"There seems to be very little 'wiggle room' in your theories. You more or less accused me of being ignorant, but yet your ideal society is impossible. You want a completely fair and equal society, you want everyone to do what they want, but for people not to be selfish. You dont seem to approve of any form of leadership, you hate the police, so this suggests you think people will be good without rules.

Ever been in a classroom with a crap teacher? it's a nightmare. In Glasgow in the 1970s the police went on strike. Within 3 days the place went to hell and the police returned voluntarily because of how bad it was. Sierra Leone was effectively in anarchy during its civil war, and you just have to google that war to see the horrific effects. It was when the British Army went in and killed key rebels that order was restored, and now the country is advancing.

People like power, and people, as much as they moan, like having people in charge because it means they have less to do. It's impossible with a global population of over 6 billion to have Athenian democracy, let alone a complete consensus on decisions. Communes are impossible world wide. For this reason, there will always be leaders and politicians. Sure, they're idiots, but they want the job, it makes them happy.

If everyone did what they wanted, life for everyone would be terrible. Who wants a job cleaning the sewers? no one; people take the job because they need money and it becomes a career. Without them, sanitation would fail and people would die in their thousands. Bin men are the same. How about farming? sounds fun, but 5am starts, very long days, reliant on the weather, and without those gov. subsidies, how will they get needed equipment, and what's the incentive to give to others? Do you really believe people will just give away food for nothing?

People are greedy, but not completely selfish. I train a lot and as a result I eat a lot, i would't say more than i need but i reckon triple what most people in the world eat as a minimum. I compete against people because i get satisfaction from beating them, and I mock rival football teams when they fail. I like to succeed. I can't help it, i've always been that way. most people i know are. I also get anoyed when people i know succeed but i don't, everyone does, it's just finding those that are honest enough to admit it.
But I also care a lot. I did my own year book, and a common theme that people wrote in it was that i was loyal and helpful to people. If a friend needs help, i'll go out of my way to give it, even it means they'll do go ahead of me. I was walking home from uni one night, i was 150m from my house, when i see a girl kicked out of a car, crying her eyes out. I walked her over a mile in the opposite direction, gave her my jacket because it was cold, and talked to her so she felt better. I did it for no other reason than it was the right thing to do.

People will always look out for themselves and their families, and try to do as well as they can and get as rich as they can. There's nothing wrong with this, because people will do good as well, by helping others. You see the world as sick and wrong, but i think you are overly critical, and that you need to realise things will never be perfect, equality will never exist and that some people are bad who need to be punished. They can be rich/poor, black/white, old/young- they need to be punished. So long as we have the aim of protecting the rights of people, and so long as we act to punish those who violate these rights, society/ civilisation is ok. Not perfect, but perfection is a lie.

A final thought, you strike me as a privately educated person, and also one who likes to be a 'rebel' and controversial. At uni, i met a lot of people with extreme views, and listening to them i got the impression that some people just like having something to moan at and to appear to have a cause. People need to accept the difference between reality and idealism, and tbh grow up a bit and accept that shit happens, you just need to get on with it.",0,1331762434,null,0,false,0,c412ufe,t3_qvz4g,t1_c412ufe,t1_c40z9pd,null,1428526509,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I got to relive some of my fondest childhood memories and share them with my kids.  Like being 'scared' of aliens made out of cellophane strung up on fishing wire, just beautiful.

I have also had to eat my words, albeit in a different way, I was really worried when I heard about New Who that they were going to do horrible things to my beloved Doctor...when I saw Ecclestone I declared he would be a terrible Doctor and would completely ruin it, and absolutely fell in love with him.  Then Tennant came along and I said the same thing and fell even more in love with Tennant.  By Smith, I knew to hold my tongue and reserve my judgment until I had actually seen the man in action ;), and of course he's doing a great job.

I have read a couple of books (gotta love book exchanges) and enjoyed them.  I just don't seek them out in the same way I go looking for the TV shows.

Though I can't speak to the radio dramas and books, there is definitely a different tone to the Classic, the old spin-offs and the new spin-offs and thankfully, they all work, at least they do for me.

Terry- played a true captains performance, solid all night and a goal to boot. was worried when he went off, you could see how intense he was on the bench.

Lampard- glue in the midfield. showed he still has so much to give to the club. nerves of steel for the penalty as we have come to expect.

Ramires- amazing athlete. boundless energy, blistering place constantly harassed Napoli in the midfield.

Drogba-played the front man role to prefection. held in up well showed his strength. always dangerous and a clinical header.

* It will provide extra revenue to the independents who created a lot of the programmes for the BBC which they wouldn't have got otherwise (and the BBC themselves, who do need the money too).

The people who expect this to be free because they've paid their license fee probably don't realise that it does cost money to clear things like royalties in the music, residuals for actors and things, and money for the independent production companies, making it expensive to cover the cost of with the license fee (and arguably a waste of the license fee).

If she did nothing or was all ""la la la run off with a strange man who I've been told is dangerous"" I think viewers would have condemned her from being a negligent mother. I think the problem is that no matter what she did people would criticize her.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Splendid reply. 

To start with, I didn't say you are ignorant and didn't think it. In fact I said you seemed intelligent but were missing something. It seems to me you are pretty congnizant but need to take a leap in order to really get your teeth into stuff. 

Maybe the weakness is in going through the education system to the point of uni. But I am just speculating. 

It's funny that I gave the impression of a private educated person. I haven't heard that before. I am actually a pretty uneducated person. I pretty much refused to do any schoolwork and just blagged my way through avoiding any serious trouble by copying other kids' homework (and god bless 'em for being generous enough about it). 

I used to sit at the back of the class reading Freud and Plato hoping I wouldn't get caught not paying attention to the dimwits reciting uninteresting information from badly written books. Reading Plato could get you in some serious shit. 

Anyhoo, as I said you seem pretty smart but you have been indoctrinated with some silly preconceptions so you make some banal assumptions:

&gt;You want a completely fair and equal society

I would like to have a *more* fair and equal society. This society is incredibly unequal. If we look around the world, the inequality goes very deep. Completely? No. WHo would even suggest such a thing? 

&gt;you hate the police

I don't like the police as an institution. I don't care about the hired thugs who work for the police either way. 

The police don't really inspire much confidence. Do they maintain some semblance of order? I suppose so but why is society so fucked up we need this? And when the shit hits the fan, or you go to a peaceful demonstration, you see what the police is really like - gangs of drongos who follow orders without question. Very dangerous.  But I don't hate the police. 

&gt;you think people will be good without rules.

Nope. People probably need rules but the ridiculously complicated rules and regulations that have been created in our ""advanced"" society are incomprehensible to most people and best serve those who want to bend them. Simple social rules pertaining to good conduct are fine and dandy. Rules that help make money for lawyers and enable our uncouth overlords to mislead us and act immorally are of no real benefit. 

Anyway, I wonder which sorts of views you think are extreme. I can't imagine many people with properly extreme views could stand to go to university. I could never tolerate the hours of dullness sitting in classes. I tried to go to university via an access course but the material and the teachers were painfully uninteresting. I could learn anything I wanted to from reading and talking with people. And I am not extreme. You will find many well respected thinkers who think stuff like I do. Where do you think I got my points of view from? 

University used to help you find well paid work but that seems to be something you can no longer take for granted. I hope your debts don't cause too much grief. 

So my view in general is not as narrow as you think. I am somewhat idealistic but don't think it's a bad thng (I suppose I wouldn't would I?) however I have very little fixed idea of what would constitute a better society. I know this society is broken. Seven billion souls but only one billion can survive without oil and the oil s going to vanish very fast in the next few years. The money system is broken and if it wasn't just serves to accelerate pollution and abuse. The oceans are acidifying. The Siberian permafrost is melting and releasing gasses that have been under ice for millennia. 

And I don't think there's an answer to any of this. I don't have a strong idea of what systems would work, only inclinations. 

Idealistic young people are told to get a grip and grow up, to accept things as they are and look after themselves. That's all there is, they are told, live with it. None of your hippy shit no more. 

It's all a ruse, dark magic. 

And you are one of the thoughtful people, obviously. 

All you need to do is cross the river.

Let's not forget the overall negatives of market driven healthcare as a whole, since that is the case for the Bill.

I've posted a huge amount on who is benefiting from private health groups (and beyond) In Lib, Lab (though just look at Alan Milburn and you've got one of the main ingredients for the current mess right there) and Tory colours, so prepare for a bit of a bombarding.

That goes on and provides info on marketisation and privatisation

False comparisons with the French system being better run:

http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124958049241511735.html

The French system certainly gets a lot of praise (based on the 2000 OECD study) but conditions in ER (waiting times, etcetera) are not great at all and right roughly four million people in France can’t afford to see their own GP and cannot afford healthcare coverage which the French system requires you to have as a complement (estimated 92% are covered by top up insurance, whether they can afford to cash that in and afford extra premiums afterward...hmm. Questionable. Still 8% with nothing and their system is moving towards the US version to Assurance Maladie's massive deficit. More below)

http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/qqcsk/grim_meathook_future_english_style/c3zui9v

I posted following this aboot the French system. Worth noting that the NHS has a surplus of £1.5 billion plus as the HJS noted today

http://www.hsj.co.uk/5042733.article?referrer=e2#.T2CgbjhrVuU.twitter

and has been in surplus of around a billion for over five years
That other systems (i.e., Singapore) benefit from being non-state run (which is bollix)

http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/qovkd/what_will_the_nhsbill_do_i_dont_think_youre/c3zcrwd


I am sure that I've left out a wealth of information and carry no doubt that it's a lot to take in during one sitting. 

Have to stress that the original purpose of my post was to ask if others who had emailed their MP had received an identikit response, but am happy to respond outside of this. I'll end this post with what I've said elsewhere in one of the linked posts that relates to CCGs

&gt;Take into account the real term funding cuts the NHS has to deal with and the very real likelihood of service rationing (do not forget that because of this the NHS is currently in crisis due to those cuts and rationing is very likely!). That will involve CCGs telling patients that they are not yet in enough pain for the NHS to pay for their hip operation, or they are not blind enough for a cataract operation etcetera. These people will then, understandably, look to their savings, or cash in life insurance policy, raid their pension fund...anything to get the treatment they desperately need. 

&gt;These are the patients who will become private patients in NHS hospitals (since NHS private rates will be cheaper than the private hospitals, just look at Circle's current charges as an example. iirc they are in the region of three times more expensive). 

&gt;And that is how the Coalition will privatise the NHS.

Thanks for the responding, but gotta ask again if you;ve had anything from your MP about this? If so, is it very similar to the original post? ",0,1331775165,null,0,false,0,c4156b5,t3_qvi86,t1_c4156b5,t1_c4137iy,null,1428527625,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I know this is radical, but I would like to see Stevie G placed next to Suarez as a finisher.  He's getting old and will no doubt eventually lose his pace, but he is by far our most accurate finisher.  I think the Everton game perfectly highlighted Suarez's strength of setting up goals by making a menace of himself in tight areas in the box to set up his strike partner for a finishing touch.  Suarez is usually too over-extended by the time he has beat 2-3 defenders he can't get off a decent shot.

The problem with Carroll is that he just doesn't have the vision or intuition to make any sort of run or get in front of a defender for a through-ball.  

That being said, Adam certainly isn't good enough to fill the void in our midfield without Gerrard playing there.  Maybe with Lucas back Kenny will at least play Stevie as a very aggressive CAM like he really should have been all year.  God I have missed seeing him burst into the box to lay a perfect one-touch strike...

The characters do change and the changes are written into the story.  If you want it to make sense, you should try to watch it in some sort of order.  This is not necessarily easy on netflix, as they don't make clear what order it should go in.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans along. We've had approximately 780 episodes but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in anywhere. The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years.

We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a person will like.

Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 then relaunched in 2005. By no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv). You should choose the 2005 point.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

And then I find that the best thing one can do is see 2 or 3 stories from each Doctor and then go through classic straight through. Watching a couple stories from all the Doctors is like building a road map before you actually take the journey itself. So here are some stories for each:

William Hartnell, first- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore. The Romans. The Tenth Planet (though the last part is reconstruction only).

Patrick Troughton, second - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

Jon Pertwee, third- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

Tom Baker, fourth The most famous run. There are so many fantastic stories. Genesis of the Daleks, one of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic. And Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

Peter Davison, fifth -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special, andCaves of Androzani!* (the last story)

Colin Baker, sixth- His Doctor is unique with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good.

Sylvester McCoy, seventh. Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis. This is the era where they really try some crazy radical stories.

true,lildedlenore,tennant,Tennant,"Actually, the Blood Diamond issue has been addressed by most major jewelry companies over the last few years. There is a new internationally recognized practice called the Kimberly Process that takes the raw diamonds from legitimate mines and essentially tracks them all the way from the mines to the cutting houses to the companies that make the finished goods thus keeping the ""blood diamonds"" out of the process. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberley_Process_Certification_Scheme

Now Rubies on the other hand are just as bad, or IMHO, even worse than diamonds. The best, highest quality rubies are mined in Burma. Burma has massive embargoes on goods right now due to their long track record of human rights violations. So don't buy rubies from Burma, right? Here is the problem: they are smuggled or out right sold to the cutting centers in Thailand which is right over the border. The minute they are cut there they become a product of Thailand.

Emeralds? Best ones come out of Columbia. Most go through the hands of the drug trade.

Tanzanite? Again, government run corrupt cartels.

So honestly, in the last few years diamonds are one of the ""cleaner"" stones out there. Canada and Australia are making great headway into the Diamond markets (some of the best pink diamonds come from down under) and they have been keeping DeBeers out of it.

tl;dr -- diamonds are not as ""dirty"" as you think.

Doctor Who has major cultural significance in all of Britain, and a surprising amount of the rest of the world.

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","Increased VED will not reduce the usage level of cars, whereas increased fuel duty will. Remember that VED is a cost of owning a car at all - once I've paid it, I have no incentive to reduce my vehicle usage.

Fuel duty, on the other hand, is something I pay every journey - and I have a direct link between the miles I drive and the fuel duty I pay, so an increase in fuel duty is a reason to drive less. It's slightly delayed, as I don't fuel up on every journey, but it's still better than VED's annual charge.

Congestion charges are even more likely to influence my usage - I pay them the moment I drive at all, so have even more of a deterrent effect than fuel duty.

The congestion problem is, in many parts of the country (such as the city I live in), a consequence of school hours and working hours synchronising across the built-up area. Government has two levers to change this - one is simply changing school hours (if primary schools started earlier - say staggered between 6:30am and 7:30am - and secondary schools started later - say staggered between 10:30am an 11:30am - we would see a reduction in congestion, as peak traffic starts to spread out. Employers would also adjust to a degree, helping this happen.

A slightly harder alternative to implement is peak-time congestion charging; travel when the roads are typically busy, and pay extra, or travel when they're not busy, and pay less.

And the really easy fix costs money - make public transport so cheap that it's effectively free. At 10p/traveller, one accompanied child free with each adult, for example, the bus would be so cheap that it would not be worth driving if there was a chance of traffic. Would mean subsidy, and would disproportionately benefit the poor (who find it harder to afford the costs of running a car), so it'll probably never happen, but hey, I can dream.",0,1331802126,null,0,false,0,c418w8a,t3_qw6it,t1_c418w8a,t1_c40y5l9,null,1428529531,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I thought it was a terrible way to follow on from Let's Kill Hitler (it was originally supposed to air after The Doctor's Wife), I found it galling that this irrelevant nonsense was going on when for me the series should have, IMO, been following the overall season arc. I'd greatly anticipated it because I like all of Mark Gatiss' previous episodes but it didn't live up to my expectations.

The cinematography of it was good, and I'm a fan of Daniel Mays who played the father, but I found the story to be lacking on every level. I liked the concept of the dolls but nothing about it felt urgent, it was predictable and flat, and it never felt like there was any real danger even when Amy was turned into a doll. I also thought the very idea of somebody who otherwise seems like a good parent was routinely telling his son that the way to deal with negative emotions is to bottle them up to be a really basic error on Gatiss' part.

It was particularly annoying that Amy and Rory went from ""where the hell is our baby?"" to not even making a single mention of it, especially in an episode that revolved around a child and his parents. I understand that's because it was supposed to air before it did, but that's what it felt like in the moment.

I haven't rewatched it since it aired. Maybe it'd be worth giving it another shot now that I'm not expecting anything more than a standalone episode, but I still feel like it wouldn't really be worth it.

Secondly, there is indeed a point where borrowing can be used to fund investment for future growth, and that is wise.

The Fitch report simply points out that the current debt levels are sustainable, but if the government relaxes its borrowing criteria to fund short-term spending then that may result in debt costs rising.

Like all good economists, they will have calculated how much of the borrowing would go towards investment, which boosts output and raises the revenue to repay the debt, how much is spend on so-called economic stabilisers, which is an effective tax-payer subsidy on employment - and how much is ""wasted"" on spending that will never be recoverable in the future.

However, if there comes a point where all you are doing is pouring money down the drain in subsidising lifestyles that can never recover the investment in the form of higher economic growth in the future - then it is not unreasonable to point that out to the banks and investors who are funding such largess.

That is a political, not economic decision though - should lifestyles today be subsidised by debt in the future, or should we moderate our lifestyles to the point where they are not funded by debt that cannot be repaid?",0,1331809606,null,0,false,0,c4199hl,t3_qwzx9,t1_c4199hl,t1_c4197pd,null,1428529714,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,Tactful,uk,Bristol,"Are you really comparing the black market on cigarettes with the current market on Cocaine?

The majority of people don't buy 'black market cigarettes', and even those that do get branded, regulated cigarettes knocked off. There's no-one growing bootleg tobacco in their back yards.

Given the cost drugs take to produce, the government could tax at ridiculously high rates and it would still be cheaper than getting it from a drug dealer. Also, you're paying for quality.

To put it simple: Legalisation results in three things.

1. Regulation. Your drugs now legally have to contain actual drugs.

2. Decriminalisation. Recreationally using your drug in a similar manner to tobacco or alcohol is no longer a crime, so you no longer risk arrest for possession.

3. Price decrease. Due to the drugs now being produced by actual businesses who can streamline production and distribution, the overall cost of drugs should decrease. Weed costs less than tobacco to produce, and yet costs more per weight unit. Legalisation could only bring current prices down, which are ridiculously inflated to be honest.

There are other points too, like the fact that usage drops following decriminalisation (according to a few studies), or research on these drugs can be more widespread/gain funding, or education-wise we can teach children proper rules of usage (I would have loved to have learned this stuff in school, instead of on my own on the internet). Literally, the only legitimate reasons against legalisation are moral, political, traditional and those based in misguided health. 

[ed] There's a reason all drug dealers are against legalisation: it would absolutely destroy their business model.

I really hope Di Matteo starts him more than AVB did because he needs more game time to get his confidence and scoring prowess back - you don't get a striker back in form by dropping him to the bench.

It's nice to see Drogba back to some sort of form as well, he's not had the best season so far but seems to be turning it around.

David Luiz was absolutely brilliant as well, though he did give me a mini heart attack in ET when he took his time to clear the ball out of the box.

true,[deleted],null,null,"My son is autistic and I fully support the actions the Met took. Absolutely every single one of them. Lets address the points made...

&gt;  The judge said that ZH was at the pool for a familiarisation with four other pupils when he became fixated with the water and broke away from the group.

A person with autism has no sense of self preservation. They cannot perceive what could happen if they take a certain action. Take teaching my son to cross the road. He stops at the side of the road, looks both ways and then just sets off regardless of whether there is a car coming or not. Why? Because although he knows he has to stop and look, he doesn't know why and he can't make the link between a car coming and being run over. ZH would only have one thought on his mind - get in the water. He wouldn't connect that with drowning.

&gt;  When ZH moved closer to the pool, two officers took hold of his jacket as he began to gather momentum, but he was much too big and strong and ended up in the water, which was chest-deep.

My son at age 9 was unbelievably strong. One thing that triggers a panic attack with my son is sound. We were in Toys R Us when a message came over the tannoy. It triggered a panic attack from him. It took me all my strength to stop him running out into the road. I'm a former soldier, former lorry driver who pulled 2 tonne pallets out of wagons and I weigh 17 stone. A couple of coppers with a 16 year old autistic person stand little chance.

&gt;  ZH was moved to the shallow end and lifted out by lifeguards, with two police officers taking hold of his arms before handcuffs and leg restraints were applied.

Forget for a minute the strange new powers they picked up in the two part Crash of the Byzantium. In Blink, the Doctor explains that they aren't really angels. They're quantum locked creatures that turn into stone angels whenever someone looks at them. So, we don't know what they look like when they aren't observed. 

It's kind of like, of a tree falls in a forest and no one is around, does it make a sound? The answer is No: sound is how we perceive vibrations in air. If no one is there, then the vibrations are not transmitted by the tiny bones in your ear to the part of your brain that tells you what you are hearing.

So, we can't know what an angel looks like when we close out eyes because, in fact, it can't be seen and doesn't look like anything. *Weeping angels can't be observed while moving, so you CAN'T observe a sound from their movement.*  There IS no sound. No sonic boom.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well, it's certainly not a simple metric. 

I would suggest the value must be seen in a variety of different areas:

-The cause itself. Is it worthwhile? I think most people would agree in principle that capturing Kony is a 'good thing'. A different campaign might want to raise awareness of a disease or humanitarian disaster - both good as well. 

-The means. Are the ways in which the cause operates something we should support? The Invisible Children charity wishes to send more troops to the region in order to take Kony. Is military intervention a good idea? Is it a good idea to support the government troops who have by all accounts also done bad things?

-The medium. The way in which the message is made. We can all agree the video is very slick, but is presentation enough? Should a video manipulate the audience through reductive narrative? Over simplification of issues (look at the BAD MAN)? Empty emotional manipulation (that has nothing at ALL to do with the issue)? There is some information about the war, the child soldiers and the man himself. But is the information presented honestly? It can (and has) mislead the audience into believing the conflict is still ongoing. In a half hour video it is also VERY light on actual facts and context.

-The charity itself. Is the charity one we should support? It's an awareness charity and so of course the money sent to them is not for doing 'good deeds' like building schools etc (and indeed they have done those anyway - something I think a lot of people would support). The charity is there to raise awareness. But as Brooker points out, some of the money spent on videos has little to do with raising the awareness.

-The goal of the actual video. The goal was to raise awareness of this man, Kony. Does is succeed? Sure. Lots of people now know he exists. But is that enough? People who watch the video now know there is a 'bad man' who gets kids to do 'bad things'. He's in Uganda (was in Uganda) and we should arrest him. It has succeeded in that goal. But is that goal the right one? What about informing the audience? What about honestly presenting the issue? What about NOT misleading the audience? 

They achieved their goal they set out to do. They got people to spread the video. But that's not the only way we should judge success. The video does NOT exist in a vacuum. We should judge it on how it AIMS TO ACHIEVE the stated aims and the VALUE of those stated aims. 

At the end of the day, the people of Uganda are no longer at threat from this man. He's gone. The job presented in the video? It's kinda already done. 

I don't think anyone disagrees that Kony should be arrested, but is sending US troops and military assets to the region the best way to do this? 

-Finally we must look at the CONSEQUENCES. This video has already pissed off people in Uganda. The people of the region will now be aware that the West (specifically white Americans) view them as unable to deal with their problems. They need the strong US white man to come and save them with guns. Is this a message that is going to help?

&gt;Newton's laws are those of motion and gravity, not thermodynamics. Those of Thermodynamics were first formulated by Lord Kelvin. Gove's educational background is in English, rather than science, so some glaring errors in a subject he has no experience of are understandable, if unfortunate in the Secretary of State for Education.

When the original actor who played the Doctor, William Hartnell, decided to leave the show in 1966 after three years in the role, the show was successful and the BBC didn't want it to end.  It had already been established that the Doctor was from another world, so the producers came up with the idea that he had the power to change his appearance and personality so the show could continue without losing its lead character altogether.  Three years after that, the second actor to play the Doctor decided to leave the show, and he got a big sendoff episode in which his appearance was changed again.  And then four years after that, the next guy decided it was time to go.  

The current Doctor is the eleventh actor to play the character.  (See those figures up top of the page?  Those are *all* the Doctor.)  In almost all cases -- bar a couple of notable exceptions -- the change took place only because the actor himself felt it was time to go, and the producers then created an episode to serve as a finale and transition to the new guy.  But they wouldn't simply fire the lead actor of the series for story reasons.

Every debate seems to focus on just replacing our current 60-70GW demand with low carbon power, which in itself is enormously expensive, but not within the realms of possibility (without nuclear).

Even with **massive** personal reductions in car use and **enormous** investment in building energy efficiency, you still need to ship goods and services, medicines, emergency vehicles, food supply, you need to heat hospitals, schools, office buildings. If this is to be done with electricity you're doubling or tripling current electricity requirements. The enormity of infrastructure is difficult to imagine. Renewables will never be able to supply this in the UK, there isn't enough land or pumped storage available. With huge amounts of nuclear, huge amounts of renewables and massive ramp up in EE, we might have a chance of living in a decent society, but it still won't look anything like a the high fossil fuel world we've grown up in.

There is some appeal to this, let's plough on in the hope that we'll give ourselves some headroom to come up with better alternatives. But what evidence is there to make us think that we'll pull our heads out of our arses in the next century? 

The truth is people saw all this shit coming years ago. In the 60's some people knoew about the oil and the pollution. People have known about the fakeness of the economy since the seventies at least. We have known about the oceans and the dangers of population overshoot. At least we have known enough to think seriously about the consequences of what we're doing yet we remain resolutely ignorant. 

This logic is proposing putting your foot down on the gas even though you are heading towards a cliff on the vague hope you will not plunge off the edge but instead will do an Evil Kenival stunt and land on an opposite cliff which you don't know is there. This just because you are so used to being in the car you are afraid to get out and walk. (EDIT: not ""you"" personally, you as in ""one"")

&gt;Oh and the simple low powered life of the past will never be recreated peacefully in the UK. 70 million of us of this crowded little island, too many mouths to feed.

Probably not but the 70 million are going to starve, however unpalatable it might seem to contemplate. There is a small possibility this can be mitigated but not if we're all in denial. If things are as bad as they sound, there isn't a choice to be made. We are going to run out of oil, we are not going to be able to use the energy we are used to. We are not going to be able to import food and we will not have jobs and pay for everyone who needs them. The simple, low powered life will be forced upon us. I have had some experience of this and it's not unbearable but it's a hell of a shock if you aren't expecting it. 

Anyway, I don't see how electricity is going to stop the slowdown unless we admit we have problems. 

I heard a podcast recently where someone said that unless we convert to a steady-state economy there is no point in trying to develop technological remedies because every energy source and efficiency will just get used up as things grow.

You're right about growth as well, fundamentally that's the problem.

The whole energy efficiency thing doesn't work with growth, it just allows you to consume to the same level with less, but does nothing to actually reduce that initial level. I saw it recently with some advanced energy efficiency measures in the UK housing stock. These measures cost £15-20k, and massively improved the quality of life of residents. However, most of them were going without, or underheating their homes previously. Now with fancy insulation they managed to keep warm, but in some cases their carbon emissions actually went up. It's admirable, but the net carbon savings for the whole scheme were tiny for huge investment.

Now scale up these 'huge investments in EE' proposed by the Friends of the Earth and they're worthless, unless they're backed up with a steady state economy/fundamental political change /huge quantities of low carbon power, they're not doing anything to 'save the earth', quite the contrary.

true,emericuh,lfcflame,,"&gt; I'm sorry but most top clubs have 3-4 top class strikers.

Really? How many do Arsenal have? What about Newcastle? Tottenham? United? None of those teams have 3-4 ""top class strikers"" and all of them are above us in the league. Again, I am not protesting cover, but I the idea that we need to go spend 30 million on another striker is preposterous.

Your examples are very, very rare exceptions. How about Ronaldo, Bergkamp, Veron, Shevchenko, or Robinho? How about Edin Dzecko or Kakuta. I could go on forever. All of those players were massive transfer fees and while some did have impact, they didn't just continue where they left off in Europe (although Ronaldo did after several years). Furthermore, Suarez has not been near the goal scorer he was at Ajax and Torres actually proves my point that players don't typically switch teams and achieve the same results immediately. 

&gt; We need a pacey striker who can finish, we lack speed up front and it is very noticeable.

Suarez is pacy and can finish (give him time). So I am going to assume that you mean Carroll. Do you suggest giving up on him?

A ""tycoon"" tax, or minimum tax level, or whatever it's going to be called, will certainly help bring in more money than a 50% rate would as there *should* be less tax avoidance. That's the theory anyway.

Possible benefits? Could bring more high-earners into the country. I'm sure they'd come here anyway, but apparently not. If the personal allowance continues to rise for those on the basic tax rate, then lower earners cannot complain as they are also receiving greater tax relief.

There is room for experimentation still, Mata's role in the centre is the most 'locked-down' but Ramires and Kalou can do a job out wide, Lampard/Essien/Romeu/Mikel/Meireles remain in midfield

Torres  Mata  Ramires

Suarez is far from pacey, didn't you watch him get outrun by a 6'4 massive CB in Distin vs Everton? Suarez plays best with a quick striker who is a natural finisher, similar to his Uruguayan teammates. He had an immediate impact when he came to the EPL, not because of his goals, but his linkup play and ability to set up goals. His goals will come, but he still needs support. When Gerrard and Suarez arent playing we lack quality and imagination. I'm not giving up on Carroll, but he deserves his spot on the bench. He is still young and has plenty of time to improve. 

And are you really talking about Ronaldos form when he transferred to united?? Man United picked him up when he was 18. A lot of those other players didn't continue their goal scoring records, but most of them were valuable to the team, similar to Suarez for us. Carroll has not been valuable at all, you could easily replace him with any other player and not notice.",0,1331856279,null,0,true,0,c41hf3m,t3_qycs9,t1_c41hf3m,t1_c41h31v,null,1428533652,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Yeah - I was coming at it from a ""Christianity is anti-gay"" stance (which as far as I know is true for most denominations), but if the couple identify as Christians, and the minister is happy to perform the ceremony, then sure - why not.

Just to clarify... I just didn't want to be forcing Christian churches to do something that was against their principles.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;First, a common complaint I hear about Suarez and Carroll is that they just aren't ""clinical"" or ""proven finishers"". This is utter bullshit. In the 2009/2010 season, Suarez had 48 goals in 54 appearances with Ajax. That's about as clinical as you can get. In the first half of the 2010/2011 season, Carroll was unstoppable, scoring 11 goals in 19 appearances.

Suarez will never be that clinical in the Premier League, he's not an out and out goal scorer regardless of what he's achieved in the Dutch league. Have you seen the Dutch league? Most games finish with over 4 goals, it's ridiculously easy to score.

As for Carroll, he scored his goals due to Newcastle playing some dreadful hoofball, something which will never happen at LFC.

&gt;Second, prolific goal scorers who come to another team seldom are able to duplicate their success immediately, especially coming from another league. Christiano Ronaldo, who I think we can all agree is one of the best goal scorers in modern times, struggled to find goals his first two seasons at Manchester United, scoring only 9 goals in his first 63 appearances for the club.

Ronaldo was an 18 year old winger when he signed, he also hardly scored any for Sporting, so I'm not sure what you're getting at here.

&gt;If you think that a continental player like Cavani, Llorente, etc. could come straight in to the league and immediately be successful, you need to look at the history of football.

There is PLENTY of foreign players in the Premier League now adapting in their first season.

&gt;The reason they cost that money is they are proven in this league. Players who score 40 goals in Spain or Italy or Germany almost never match that in England.

Never? I'm sorry, but there are just as much successes as flops in the Premier League. If you think playing for a mid-table side such as Aston Villa, Sunderland etc. means you'll automatically be better than a foreign player just because they've played in the PL for a couple of years, then I'm sorry but you have no clue.",0,1331856382,null,0,false,0,c41hfr6,t3_qycs9,t1_c41hfr6,t3_qycs9,null,1428533658,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

I think the writers intended us to ask those questions. They've been presenting the Time Lords as morally ambiguous throughout the seasons, and this is another example of that. 

There's also a chicken and egg scenario here: did the time vortex turn an otherwise healthy child (The Master) into a murderous lunatic, or did the time vortex affect him because he was already a murderous lunatic waiting to hatch?

Ultimately it doesn't excuse the whole genocidal psychopath thing, but The Master's existence does raise a lot of questions about the culture of the Time Lords.

Having to do an entire season keeping a companion as an alien puts a lot of strain on the make-up department and isn't very cost-effective. Of course, they drop piles of money on CG nowadays, so who knows what they'd do at this point.

The first River regenerates at the end of Day of the Moon; its implied that she's the same River as the baby, and looks to be six or so.  She regenerates into Mels, who grew up with Amy and Rory; its implied that she's about their age, though how she got to their time is a mystery.  So in Let's Kill Hitler Mels is, say 25.  She regenerates into the River we're most familiar with and has her change of heart.  Assuming she immediately enters school, it would still take her a few years to earn a doctorate, so that places her in her late 20's at the time of her (adult) involvement in The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon.

From there she spends an indeterminate amount of time in Stormcage/escaping Stormcage; this is when the Crash of the Byzantium, the Pandorica, the Battle of Demon's Run, and at least two birthdays take place, along with adventures that are only referenced.  Finally, you have the Library episodes, at the end of which she sacrifices herself so the Doctor won't sacrifice himself.  I think its safe to say that all of those didn't happen one right after the other, so she probably spent several years in Stormcage.

So assuming her general life events happen in quick succession and a minimum of time, she's at least in her mid-30's.  The big question mark is how she got from New York City in 1969 (her regeneration into Mels) to Leadworth in the '90's (growing up with Amy and Rory); its very possible she lived through that time, adding another ~30 years to her total.

Everyone seems to believe that it's the Doctor himself. And that's probably who it'll end up being (if it's not Benedict Cumberbatch as the Master). And, if it really is the Doctor, I sincerely hope/believe that it'll be the 8th Doctor.
Think about it: who would the Doctor be most afraid of? The version of himself that killed everyone he ever loved. Since I never saw anything to contradict this theory (please point out any episode in which it says otherwise), I always sort of believed that the 8th Doctor was the one who fought in the Time War and killed everyone. And it was in using ""The Moment"" that he ended up injuring himself so badly that he had to regenerate into the 9th Doctor, aka ""survivor's guilt"" Doctor.
I'm basing that theory largely on 9's actions during ""The Parting of the Ways."" He has the option to kill the Daleks and end all life on Earth but he can't go through with it. Arguably, this is because he sees Earthlings as having nothing to do with the Time War but I believe that 9 could never do anything like that.

He just likes to mope on the sideline. He can't pass for shit, he doesn't defend, he doesn't make runs when the entire sideline is open. As much as it pains me to say it, Malouda had a better night than he did IMO. I am over Studge as our striker of the future unless he gets his shit together. Torres (who I would like to see get more time at any forward position) does all of these things better than sturridge does. I have not seen Sturridge do anything in the last two months that warrants moving him to central striker. He has not earned it IMO. Torres plays his heart out every single second and you can feel the support the fans have for him.

Assuming that in order to become a professor, as she was referred to in the Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead, she would probably have her Masters degree. This means 4 years of undergraduate work, and between 2 and 4 years of Grad school. We'll say 3. So, at least 7 years of schooling. This means that she's at least 42 years old. 

Then we have to add in the years that she would have accumulated between everything while traveling with the Doctor, and the years that she spent in Stormcage. I'm not sure how many years she would have added as part of this, but would say it's probably at least 2/3 years, if not more. 

So, River is probably about 45 or more years old.

The idea of a militaristic command spaceship commandeered by a crew of tiny people that looks like a human designed to infiltrate and blend in as a human is *exactly* Meet Dave.

And besides, the concept is patently idiodic. The only reason one *would* take the idea is to rip off Meet Dave, which in itself is a terrible idea.

The very concept of hundreds of men shrinking down to fit into a space ship that disguises itself as a human makes no sense. Why not make an android and have the android controlled from a distance? Doctor Who has already displayed such technology, specifically of a shape-shifting android.
