Some things are worth getting your heart broken for
After all this time, everything we saw, everything we lost, I have only one thing to say to you: BYE!-Ten
You could be so wonderful. You're a genius. You're stone cold brilliant, you are, I swear you really are. But you could be so much more. You could be beautiful. With a mind like that, WE could travel the stars, it would be my honor, 'cause you don't need to own the universe, just see it. Have the privilege of seeing whole of time and space.

You're not going to make the world any better by shouting at it. -Wilfred
People fall out of the world sometimes, but they-they always leave traces, little things you can't quite account for: faces in photographs, luggage, half eaten meals...rings. Nothing is ever forgotten, not completely. And if something can be remembered, it can come back.-The Eleventh Doctor
Everything's got to end sometime, otherwise nothing would ever get started.-The Eleventh Doctor
If it's time to go, remember what you're leaving. Remember the best. My friends have always been the best of me.-The Eleventh Doctor

true,rogersmith25,null,null,"I think you are deliberately missing the point. 

Of course there were female law students. Presently, judges aren't exclusively male. We are talking about trends.

The false logic of the quote I was highlighting is this: 1) presently there are more women in law school; 2) presently there are more male judges. Therefore, women's career's atrophy. But, of course, students enrolling in law school will not be eligible to become judges for decades.

The problem is that the present composition of judges is a reflection of educational standards set 30-40 years ago. Presently, [judges is the USA are about 28% female](http://www.laits.utexas.edu/txp_media/html/just/features/0403_01/judges.html). Also, [the class of 1980 was 28% female.](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_education/resources/statistics.html) (Sorry to use american stats, but they were easiest to find).

You would expect that the percentage of judges to approximately reflect the number of law students.

Furthermore, the number of judges at present is also a reflection on social and educational prejudices going all the way back to the 1960s. The present composition of judges cannot be used as a reflection of the present educational and social standards. To do so is incredibly shortsighted.

true,rogersmith25,null,null,"""By 2015, it is estimated that 90 per cent of those qualifying will be women."" From the article (a ctrl-f for ""90"" finds it pretty quick).

We are still talking about social biases inhibiting female students from excelling at science and math, but the ""science gap"" between boys and girls has been closing for decades. This gap is being closed because of a concerted effort to ensure fairness between boys and girls. Standardized tests have been rewritten. Evaluation methods changed. And significant outreach has been aimed at getting girls interested in technology degrees.

However, comparatively little has been done to help boys who are now lagging behind girls in nearly all aspects of school. The sad thing is that boys are blamed for their poor results - they lack attention or the ability to ""multi-task"". When girls were falling behind, changes were made to help them - it would be considered very sexist to say that girls simply do not have the aptitude for science. In fact, when Harvard president Larry Summers suggested as much, the ensuing controversy lead to his resignation.

So why is there no equivalent protest when boys continue to fall behind in education and commentators place the blame squarely on them? President Obama cheered the education gap, calling the 25% more female than male graduates from American colleges a ""great accomplishment"". While the math and science gap is being closed by changes to the education system, what can be said about the gap in language skills? Most are simply happy to stand by the ancient mentality that girls are simply better communicators.

Finally, whether your comment was meant to be kind, as you said, or condescending, as it seemed, the blanket rejection of any pro-male commentary on the basis that it is from an ""irrational MRA"" represents the exact same sexism that a woman would have faced 50 years ago. So perhaps all of that feminist ""privilege"" rhetoric is in need of a second look...

It's not that I want to ignore what he said at the end, but if it was a big deal he should have had enough respect for himself as 9 not to brush it off.  He does SEEM very different, I agree, but even in the face of a concerned companion who developed an attachment to the previous incarnation, he's just like, ""No, it's fine.""  So are you just...okay with that?  Like, it's a big deal when he wants to make it a big deal?

I really think it needs to be a balance of 9-10 and 10-11.  I think 10's regeneration was way over the top, but 9's regeneration really didn't have enough emphasis behind it.

It is not simply a case of 36 years v. 1894 years, in this respect, numbers actually mean very little. Firstly, Amy is left behind through no choice or fault of her own. In comparison, Rory chose to wait as a penance for killing Amy, he wanted to protect her, yes, but when you consider the Pandorica is meant to hold the Doctor, it’s probably pretty secure.

Amy is left in isolation for those 36 years with no human or alien contact, with daily battles to stay alive. She changed enormously during those years, how many times must she have had depressive moments in which she considers giving up and letting the handbots put her to sleep? But no, every day she fought to live – 13140 days of fighting.

In comparison, yes, Rory fought to protect the Pandorica. But it was not every day, he was not under constant threat for his life. He was able to protect the Pandorica simply by being there as a presence and even just persuading people to leave it alone. Furthermore, during his time he was able to socialise with other people, he travelled the world, he fought alongside historical figures, he had a *life* that did not revolve around just staying alive.

Rory knew what would happen at the end of his waiting – he’d already seen the Doctor in his fez, he knew Amy survived, heck, in a way he even knew he would survive. Amy however didn’t, she was stuck waiting for the Doctor who has already continually abandoned her (and abandonment as a child is a difficult thing to forget). She didn't know what would happen and whether she would ever see Rory again. When Young Amy sees Future Amy, you can see the memories start to form, Time is rarely circular in the Whoniverse, and we cannot assume that Future Amy actually previously experienced that conversation.

Ageing: Amy aged. She grew old without the husband she loves and is suddenly confronted him in his young glory. The embarrassment, shame and anger she must be feeling towards the Doctor depriving them of the best years of her life. And she is angry at the Doctor – not Rory – because he hides away in his TARDIS and doesn’t face what has happened.

Rory however didn't age. Yes, there was a threat of death and not healing, but the passage of time was never an issue. He knew he would be physically young when Amy awoke, and in a sense it didn’t matter because his goal was the future, it was to waste time.

Furthermore, the fact that these posts suggest that Rory would say such a thing to Amy is abhorrently out of character for him. He would *never* revel in Amy’s misery, or try to compete in a ""who suffered the most"" competition. If you don’t like Amy, fine, whatever, but using this episode to accuse her of being selfish is, in my opinion, woefully ignorant of both their experiences.

&gt;I'll also mention here that though the Doctor was basically sacrificing himself for the entire universe

And at the same time laying the foundation for his return. The Doctor is very good at appearing to sacrifice himself, but truly knows that he can do more good for the universe alive. Telling Amy to remember something he said when she was seven, whispering the trigger words that would be said at her wedding, actually being prepared for the wedding by *dressing in a dinner suit*.

The program appears to revolve around the cult of the judges, with most of the screen-time taken up by shots of their hilariously un-candid expressions. I would believe an episode of My Family to be less scripted than this.

The part with this Alexander girl was remarkable, and telling about the premise of the show. Her mic was clearly mixed in a way to reduce the 'punch' of her voice, and made her sound quite flat. The judge's mics on the other hand were clear with a wide dynamic range.

When she started singing her cover, it was clear (by the 'subtle' facial cues made by the judges) that she was going nowhere. As a gesture of 'goodwill' they offered her a chance to sing another song (again, focusing attention on these celebrity judges), which they had just-so happened to have ready on the sound system, ""just turn the tape over!"".

She was then told she was crap, and stormed off in an *outrageously* and *scandalously* bad temper, shoving a few cameramen in her wake. It's such a badly crafted gosip-drama, I get a headache just thinking that people can follow it. My descriptions can't do it justice.

And just to add that nobody has specifically mentioned children; how Amy and Rory will now not only not grow up and spend their lives together, but they will also never have a family either.

By more choice, I mean more choice about when you shop. 

I can't count the number of times I've found myself after 5pm on a Sunday wanting to buy something from a shop, but not being able to because all the shops are closed. The economy probably loses out on a few hundred quid from me every year as a result.

&gt; It also means prices go up because of the increased wage bill for the shops and companies that weren't previously open and it gives people working in shops more money to help push house prices up as they can now afford to buy something more expensive.

I don't think it would result in a significant price increase. We are quite fortunate to have healthy competition between supermarkets in the UK, and there is constant downward pressure on prices.

I think I lurked just as much this week, but just didn't have the time to really post much. And it was refreshing not seeing the same stuff litter the subreddit, and to see some original content.

Yes, the subreddit was much slower, and had much less participation, but I'll take low amounts of higher quality posting over high amounts of low quality postings.

I agree with the guidelines needing more definition to them. I was trying to do my part all week and report everything I saw that would break the rules of meme-free-week, but I was constantly having to think,""Does...does this count?"" Sometimes I would just be safe and report it, and other times I would see if the mods would delete it themselves. I slowly got a feel for what exactly was being deleted, but it certainly needs to be written out more.

For what is allowed, as outlined by this post(original artwork, cosplay, look who I ran into)I think there exists a slippery slope that we need to try and nip in the bud, and have those things fall under 'If you have original content that falls under these categories, feel free to post it'. Otherwise I think we'll be back to square one with people just reposting *other* people's celebrity encounters, cosplays, etc. Otherwise I think we'll eventually just have the same 'Look who I ran into while wearing my TARDIS cosplay!' picture posted every other week.

One more thing, and I believe it was mentioned in last week's post, but I'd like to see a weekly meme thread, at least during the running season.

true,kingofbiscuits,uk,United Kingdom,"We're discussing the workshy so social mobility and finding employment are irrelevant. They do not want to work and therefore it would be a waste of money to pay for services they wont use.

If they have been out of work for more than 2 years and have not attempted to find work at least once a week they would be moved.

Move them to suburban areas where land and therefore housing is cheaper since we'll be footing the bill, if necessary building on current forest land to build a community so that they have direct access to services they need so a local community doctors and school.

They would obviously have to be socially housed since they have no jobs so building cheap housing or tenements and putting them in it to save on costs in the long term.

They are relocated to the nearest of the above areas depending on where they're from so that the adjustment isn't too huge.

Since it will be a new area or alternatively near an existing area the impact would be that construction work and maintenance would be required helping to improve nearby economies. In the long term more policing would of course be needed but this cost would be offset from the savings of social housing in dense areas that we're no longer paying for.

It will make a difference because people who want to work can now move into the housing previously occupied by the workshy - making them closer to work and helping to create new wealth in that area - hence more commerce.

You're rather missing the point. We have a situation in which I want to give a business my custom on a Sunday evening, a whole bunch of businesses want my custom on a Sunday evening, but the state is intervening to prevent a sale.

&gt; Where do you draw the line? By that logic, shops should be open 24 hrs x 365 days a year on the 'off chance' that someone wants to buy something

If shops want to stay open 24x7, more power to them! Ultimately, it should be up to the businesses to decide when and when they want to stay open. 

3am on a Wednesday? It's probably not economical to stay open, but 6pm on a Sunday? Almost certainly worth it.

Edit: See also the benefits of Sunday trading reform for workers with non-traditional schedules, e.g. mothers of young children who have to look after their children during the week while their partner is at work, but are able to work weekends.

Also, a bit of anecdotal evidence:

&gt; I find that far from causing an increase in consumer prices, the liberalisation of shop-closing regulations in Germany actually lowered prices to some extent, though revenue was unaffected by the deregulation. This decrease in prices was probably driven by productivity increases created by the smoothing of consumer traffic over a longer period of time and the greater ability of consumers to compare prices in a deregulated environment.

— http://www.iea.org.uk/blog/regulating-shop-opening-hours-harms-both-consumers-and-workers 

In other words, Sainsbury's will no longer get away with having their Sainsbury's Local stores open longer hours on Sundays charging higher prices than their regular stores.

I'm expecting Waitrose to pay there staff more, since the alternative seems to be that I pay taxes to subsidise rich peoples cleaners and nannies and Waitrose shelf stackers.

We are not creating postcode lottery since hospitals and schools are provided by Primary Care Trusts and Local Education Authorities and those manage areas much larger than the regions we are talking about.  It's not like there are schools and hospitals lying empty as it is since if there is less demand in one place those bodies close or shrink services there and open them else where.  And even if that were not the case, why should people not in social housing be bared from using those services!?

All I want is some sense around benefits and housing.  To me, it makes no sense that I pay tax and buy a season ticket to get to work and can't afford my own place *so that* Waitrose can hire people for minimum wage to do unimportant jobs in rich areas.

We can also agree that the distribution of wealth is unbalanced, but I wouldn't say unfair, as there is no fair or unfair in the universe. The universe isn't cruel, or fair, it is just indifferent.

And unfortunately, as much as we hate these people who get paid a lot, in a way we need them. I mean, some of them are lying, cheating, manipulating cunt holes, but without infrastructure, without produce, where would we be? Who could actually survive if they were left in rural England without any help? We've forgotten what it is to live simple, and now we rely on these food suppliers and electricity and fresh water. And these people run them. 

It is indeed easy to cheat the system, I think mainly because almost all of it is done through letters and phone calls. It's very rare for an actual doctor to check you. They should have proper health care professionals check you to see if you are actually ill.

The problem I think is that people think ""fuck that why should I work hard"", if you can't have what others have, suddenly having something less is no good? I don't earn that much but me and the mrs have built a nice existence, we go on holiday tomorrow, I have a nice car, apartment, it's good. I started with shit all though.

My sister though, she just hates people who work hard. She thinks she deserves to have the same as them, as me, and she dislikes the fact that I can afford this and that and she can't. But I work every day, every week, every year, she doesn't. And that's the problem. Some people just feel they should get it without hard work. And as nice as that sounds, it just isn't practical.

I don't even know what the solution is. I just know that I spend a lot of time that I should be working, actually not working, but instead filling out this form or that form or writing this letter or that to sort out benefits for my family member who actually needs benefits.

And as horrible as the word benefits has come to be, to the people who are actually unable to work, it is their life force. 

It's horrible that these cheats and scroungers have taken something which is revolutionary and amazing, something that shows we're all one big team, one nation, looking after the weak, that no-one should starve to death etc, and turned it into something to be ashamed of, and avoided.

I'm not saying *I* should be the judge, I'm saying the *shops* should be the judge. If a shop wants to stay open at 3am, let them. If a shop wants to stay open at 8pm on a Sunday, let them. It should be up to them to decide when they want to do business, not the state. 

I was just pointing out that, for most stores, staying open at 3am on a Wednesday probably wouldn't be economical. 8pm on a Sunday almost certainly would be. There are tons of people who want to shop at the weekend.

&gt; And who cares about the independent stores that can't really afford the extra wages. What you want is to crush all the independents entirely and have big box out of town shopping 24/7.

If independent shops can't afford, or don't want, to open longer hours on Sunday, and lose business as a result, so be it. If they go out of business as a result, so be it. Inefficient and unsustainable businesses being pushed out of the market.

We shouldn't use Sunday trading laws as a crutch for inefficient businesses.

&gt; I suggest you check out the US and in particular walmart if you want to see where that leads.

Look around you. The UK is already dominated by 'big box' retailers. Consumers love them. I have half a dozen 'big box' sites within a 15 minute drive of where I live, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

The high street model is dead. It can't compete. High street retail spaces are too small, too expensive, the parking and access for deliveries is inadequate, so on and so forth.

* The age and lack of control over the Doctor's TARDIS means it has evolved a much more significant personality than is normal, and a lot of weird rooms and stuff as a result.

* Standard use of a TARDIS would probably not even involve getting out. They'd transduce somewhere in a perfect disguise, and then observe (this is what the Master does in ""The Keeper of Traken"").

Pen y Fan is an obvious good hike, highest mountain in the South and all that.  Personally (given a choice and all that), I'd either take it from the North from Cwm Llwch - nice track up onto Crib Goch, over Pen y Fan and back down the next ridge - or from the South, there's a gorgeous track from a car park at 043165 up through the forest, scramble up on to the ridge, right round the horseshoe of the mountains and back down a bridleway.
There's a nice walk up onto Fan y Big as well, similar to the first Pen y Fan one.
If you want to go a little further West there's a red kite feeding station with a camp site right next to it just to the North of Black Mountain.  Short walk up onto the hills from there.

It's a pretty big area to try to explore in a short time, but everything on the mountains is Access Land, so it's legal to meander where you like on it.  I'd suggest check out a vaguely interesting route on a map (starting from bus stops etc? - try [traveline](http://www.traveline-cymru.info/) or [this](http://www.travelbreconbeacons.info/beacons-bus) and go from there.

Or if you fancy going somewhere off the bus routes, drop me a message and I'll see if there's sometime I'm off shift and can give you guys a lift somewhere and walk myself.

Some rich people even realise they have too much, Keanu Reeves for example.

I think a lot of people are where they are because of exactly how they would react to getting that £5,000.

In 1997 a 15-year franchise deal was founded on the winning bidder's promise to increase revenue by so much it would fund a 140mph upgrade with enough left over to pay Daft £1.2bn. But the ""promised plan"" was so unrealistic Daft gave huge bailouts for the franchise and upgrade (diluted to 125mph).

My instructor was firmly of the belief that how quickly you learn/pass is directly correlated to your age - the younger you are, the quicker you learn.  Also, just doing one hour every week won't advance you - you spend that hour remembering what you did the previous week, and don't have much time to learn anything new.  

I advocate the way I learned - lots of lessons close together.  It worked for me, and I was learning a new manoeuvre every couple of lessons, rather than every month.

If you like it I'll get S_G or Hellier to do some CSS magic and add it to the sidebar :)

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"I've got a bad feeling about this. Blackpool are a top team with some excellent players and a really admirable style of play. Moreover, they ripped us a new one at Elland Road last season (Rachubka and sending off aside, we were still getting mullered) and beat us on their turf at the end of last season, although that was a more even contest between two teams with shaky defences and exciting forwards.

As far as I'm aware, Blackpool's defence isn't much better than it was last season, while ours is looking much improved, so it is hopeful that we'd have a better chance this time around. However, I just can't see past Ince and (Matt) Phillips, who are in my opinion two of the very best wingers in the Championship. Aidy struggled at times against Wolves' winger(s) and this will be an even sterner test. I've a feeling that he'll stick with Byram, considering that he did so well against Jarvis, but he won't have Green's work rate helping him out this time around, which will be perilous.

On the bright side, with Austin and Norris, we've two central midfielders who will get into Blackpool's midfield and not just stand off them, which is what we've been crying out for. However, our midfielders were hoofing and hoping at times and Blackpool will be more than happy to just start an attack from the back again, especially with Ferguson dictating the tempo.

One aspect in our favour is that, aside from the wingers and (Kevin) Phillips, I think that they have some trouble with finishing and I'm almost certain that they don't have a proper target man in their ranks (which is why they took Paynter on trial). This further justifies Warnock's decision to play Peltier in central defence, as he has the pace and mobility to deal with balls played on the deck, while in comparison he struggles in the air.

I really think that we'll let a goal in, but the question will be whether we can score or not. When I started writing this, my gut told me that we were going to lose but, having considered what I know of the two teams, I'm going to predict a **1-1 draw.**

For the record (as-if this post wasn't long enough!), here's my predicted line-up:

(Right sided players to left sided players)

----------------Kenny

Byram---Peltier---Pearce---White

Diouf---Norris---Austin---Varney

-------------McCormack

--------------Becchio

Early starter! I wasn't massively into dance music till I came back from Uni. Before that I pretty much only listened to Urban music, being from East London. I only went for the 1st time in '07 when I was 21 and started getting into more genres, so can't really offer as much of an insight as you. But the 1st 2 years I went were very different to what is now. And even without going to Ibiza, I could tell from all the people in my area that suddenly had an interest in going that it had changed a bit (it's weird how raving suddenly became mainstream cool again). I think it goes in cycles though. Just before Kevin and Perry times it would have been a similar stage in the cycle to what it is now I reckon i.e. Commercial.

Agree with Ibiza Rocks analysis. And yeah a lot of people just don't have a clue who's playing though. Still, can't begrudge them. As long as people are behaving themselves you can still get goods vibes. I'm kind of all for it. It's cool that more people are taking the time to have a good dance.

Thing is trance ain't as big out there as it once was so probably not quite your cup of tea any more. But it's still an awesome place, it'll definitely be worth a visit again sooner or later.

However, I think it's inevitable that there will come a point where Sam drops out of the side this season, but that's perfectly natural for a player his age. He will burn himself out, but the beauty of his unexpected promotion to the first team is that we already have the strength in depth to cover for it.

Don't get hung up on ""I passed my test first time"" ""I only needed this many lessons"" etc. Make sure you've got a good driving instructor who you're happy with and rub along with OK. They should be pushing you forward to do new things but they should be building up to things. Quiet roundabout, master it, go to the busy one. Comfortable driving at 30, go into a 40 or fifty, then National speed limit roads. 

I took my car test a fair while ago. The major recent change is that you have to do the interdependent drive. Which shouldn't present a problem. Even if you go the wrong way, you won't fail. You've just got to drive safely. Learn the highway code. Its basically the blueprint for driving. Speaking of which driving can be divided into two major categories, car control and roadcraft or road skills. The former is about making the machine do what you want it to giving a smooth drive with deft use of the controls, the latter is about reading the road and making good choices. A lot of drivers make very sudden decisions because they do not read the road far enough ahead. Eyes on main beam. Keep looking where your main beams would shine to, then back to the mid ground. You'll pick up a lot more clues about what is happening. Early vision means an early decision. You give yourself more time to think. 

After you've passed your test consider doing IAM or ROSPA, both are much the same, much better than pass plus. They really will equip you with the skills to become a good driver. 

Remember to look out for motorcycles. Too many people pull out on me on the bike. Its really mind boggling when I think how many people simply aren't thinking when they're driving. 

I remember when I first learned to drive. I thought I was never going to get on with it.

The thing is that the biggest nights now are commanded by David Guetta which is at Pacha and costs €100 a ticket. I haven't got a problem with people liking that Music but it just makes it less attractive to the more seasoned people who have seen Ibiza change over the years. The crowd has definitely changed as well and the clubs have started to host shit nights to pull in even more money.

In 1997 a 15-year franchise deal was founded on the winning bidder's promise to increase revenue by so much it would fund a 140mph upgrade with enough left over to pay Daft £1.2bn. But the ""promised plan"" was so unrealistic Daft gave huge bailouts for the franchise and upgrade (diluted to 125mph).

true,jaysabi,tardis,TARDIS,"**tl;dr** *The time loops aren't an actual paradox, they just appear to be a paradox when you view time linearly, and we've been told time doesn't happen that way. When there is a true paradox, there is a consistent pattern of something bad happening because of the existence of the paradox. See full comment for explanation.*

Self-fulfilling time loops don't violate the canon we've been given due to the explanations that we've been given about how time works. We've been told time is complicated and not linear and further that only Time Lords really understand it. Therefore, while we view a self-fulfilling time loop as an ontological paradox, it's only because we're viewing it in a linear fashion where A happens before B before C, and that's not how it actually happens due to how complex time is. ""It's a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey... stuff."" The logic is therefore that these events are NOT actually an ontological paradox when viewed ""from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint.""

As for the reaper creatures in Father's Day, those were a specific response to that particular paradox: Rose traveling back in time to save her father which would have stopped her from coming to save her father. This is a paradox which damages time, and the creatures have come to heal the wound. It has nothing to do with the first Rose seeing the second Rose save her father (remember, the first timeline of Rose and the Doctor is then immediately erased by the actions of the second Rose and Doctor). Rose and The Doctor take refuge in the church which is strong enough to keep the creatures out until Rose touches baby Rose, because that increased the power of the paradox. When Amy touches young Amelia Pond and when Kazran Sardick touches young Kazran in the Christmas episode ""A Christmas Carol,"" these are similar paradoxes where there are no consequences, and in my mind, it has not been explained why. 

But the whole 'time happening at once' thing is consistent with the paradox reaper creatures as well. Remember, the reapers came to repair a damage in time as a result of a paradox. Time was happening all at once because [spoiler](#s ""a fixed point was altered when River didn't kill the Doctor""); the mother of all paradoxes. Time was happening all at once because time had completely stopped, so there was no past and no future, only the present, and further time was completely dying out. All of time, all of existence, dying because of the scale of the paradox. ",0,1345481569,null,0,false,0,c5w0zg0,t3_yiom5,t1_c5w0zg0,t1_c5vzthx,null,1429688487,42,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,42

8 September ties in with a theory of mine, regarding Labor Day, here in the states.  Normally, networks here in the states don't like airing new episodes of shows on Labor Day weekend, because of what weekend it is, and people aren't likely to be tuning in to watch shows.  It's because of this that the last half of series six was delayed a week after each episode aired in the UK, last year.

Series 7 might still start 1 September in the UK, but because of Labor Day weekend, be delayed a week.  Then again, that clashes with BBC America's trend of airing new Doctor Who episodes same-day (but they broke that trend last year, as I mentioned).

1) Know our limits. QPR are not a top 4 side. We should not try to emulate one. Premier League teams are experts at exploiting this type of naivety.

2) We have a top quality goalscorer in Cisse. He is no use to us with his back to goal 30 yards out. If Hughes wants his striker to do that, pick Zamora.

3) We don't play with a target man so for f***s sake don't play with 4 recognised wingers.

4) Our defence is our weakest area. It needs support from the midfield, which was set out in a much too attacking manner against Swansea.

5) Taarabt's deep lying role is tactically interesting but extremely risky, given that he's not nearly as good as passing as he thinks he is and is guaranteed to give the ball away in a dangerous area at some, if not many, points during the game. Since everyone else has spread out to give him options, losing the ball will often leave our defence completely exposed.

6) Learn from last season. We were decent once it finally dawned on the squad that we had to fight for every single pass, tackle and shot in every minute of every game. That is the premier league mentality - if you are complacent you will be punished.

7) We can't play a high defensive line. End of. We conceded 6 against Chelsea last season because Hughes decided our super-slow centre-backs should hold a line 40 yards away from goal, allowing Torres time and space to net a hat trick. Second half against Swansea was the same thing. We defend deep, we plug the gap in front of the back four with combative central midfielders, and we exploit space on the counter attack to get the ball to Taarabt in the final 3rd, or to slip through balls to Cisse running on.

That's just the reality of modern London, blame the capitalist system if you want to - it's not going to change.

These Daily Mail stories of families living in 1 million pound houses just aren't real (well, they are for 0.00000001% of social housing tentants in Cent London). What this policy would lead to would be the very small bungalow type houses/flats being removed &amp; the area gradually transformed into a more affluent area filled with million pound homes. **If done right**, the policy would lead to the families living in these ""very small bungalow type houses/flats"" areas being moved out of central london into suburbs &amp; the green belt, which would lead them to a better quality of life.

If anything, gradually moving the poorer population away from central London would improve their living conditions, especially if it's in the outskirts/suburbs of London where there's more greenery &amp; a better quality of surroundings.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;I haver asked, and I'll ask again. what were these long term benefits.

So now you refuse to acknowledge *any* advancements at all? Or are you asserting that they were all discovered/ developed in Africa in tandem with the rest of the world?

&gt;It strikes me as odd that despite frequent requests as to what these were, and the constant reference to them, I've only received vague suggestions like ""medicine"" and ""infrastructure

Why is it odd? Are you suggesting that indigineous medicine, science and infrastructure in Africa were equal to or better than those of the colonial countries, or that they were denied when these countries were given back?

&gt;This implies that the institutes of learning where the British practiced this science and medicine were open to the native population. 

Not necessarily directly in every case, but the local population would benefit from them even if it was just as a byproduct. You could, for example, argue that every advancement the colonials left behind were only done so as byproducts, but that doesn't change where those advancements came from or the advantages they brought.

&gt;Again I ask, what evidence is there of this?

And again, I will ask - where is the evidence that it wasn't? Where are the *African* scientific discoveries for things like electricity or anaesthetics?

&gt;You yourself bring up Mugabe.

Er...actually that wasn't me.

&gt;He kicked out Western farmers only to plant these so called ""veterans"" who had inadequate training in modern agricultural practices. 

Yes he did, bless him.

&gt;Knowledge is power and the white farmers kept that to themselves.

Farming knowledge? Despite being freely available to anyone from several sources, starting with the internet? You'd have to ask Mugabe. The difference between the two is that the British left around sixty years ago, and it wasn't too long before then that we were still shoving kids up chimneys and sticking pregnant women in asylums - Mugabe is *right now*. That's a *huge* difference.

&gt;what makes you think the colonial settlers of the past were any different?

Because (in this case) Mugabe hasn't brought any discoveries or advancements with him. Sorry, but we're back to 'what have the romans ever done for us', and as stated above, to compare the two without any context is a bit disingenious, really.

&gt;You're all suggesting building a grand city for yourself, with modern infrastructure and complicated facilities, and then abandoning it to people you had digging the land is somehow noble.

Well, I can't speak for anyone else, but you're apparently asserting that the advantages the colonials brought with them don't exist, giving no real evidence of your own but demanding it from everyone else. The romans didn't exactly treat the locals here very well either, certainly not once we'd burned down London - but to suggest that we didn't benefit from their superior technology in any way at all is so laughable that it's ended up as a Python sketch.",0,1345483454,null,0,false,0,c5w1m1e,t3_yhq54,t1_c5w1m1e,t1_c5w0okv,null,1429688782,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

[""A few weeks later I wrote an article on becoming jaded with popular culture, in which I had the temerity to mention parenthood again. Briefly, and only in passing – but boy did some readers go for me in the comments section.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/10/human-lives-unfortunate-upgrades)

""Oh Brooker, you smug, simpering, self-satisfied, mimsy, middle-class, latte-sipping, fleece-wearing, washed-up, shark-jumping, progeny-spawning embarrassment. I remember way back when you used to be relevant. When you wrote those columns slagging off reality show contestants. Remember those rebellious glory days? You said Anton du Beke looks like a man who jizzes sherbet or something and it was hilarious. Now look at you. You've become everything you used to criticise – literally everything. AND you've grown your hair a bit: the ultimate betrayal*. You've let yourself down, but worse than that, you've let me down – me, your cherished reader: the single most important person in your life.""

I hereby resign from whatever contest of cultural significance these keyboard-bothering nincompoops think they're conducting. The key point these wailing children fail to appreciate is that becoming less relevant is my inevitable destiny. It's their destiny too, but they're way too full of snot and pep to notice. The real tragedy is not that I'm doomed to fade, but that I'm doomed to fade just to make room for these pricks.

Well prick away, cocksure Sharpington Sharp, because one day, you'll be so irrelevant you'll actually stop breathing. Your body will decompose to a grey, pulpy mulch that will fertilise the soil the next generation will nonchalantly trample over on its way to the hologram shop. And that's how I picture you when I read your comments – as a shovelful-of-putrefied-matter-to-be making the very least of its brief window of consciousness. Under those circumstances, your level of snark merely strikes me as tragicomic.

All of which is a longwinded and possibly over-defensive way of saying I'm going to mention babies again. And again and again and again. Look, I'm mentioning them now: BABIES. I'll mention them as often as I like. In fact I might ask them to print this entire column in a special Winnie-the-Pooh font, with a photograph of a mobile, just to make it more offputting to the cool kids.""",0,1345483810,null,0,false,0,c5w1q96,t3_yikve,t1_c5w1q96,t1_c5vx41k,null,1429688843,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

I think an important point to consider is the difference between fixed points and paradoxes. Now I'm no expert on Who Lore, I'm just going on my interpretation of things so if I make any mistakes I'd love to know where I'm going wrong.

A paradox is an impossible situation (or at least seems impossible from a linear interpretation of time) that can result during time travel. A fixed point is simply an event in spacetime that cannot be altered. Messing with either of those things in different ways can have different effects. 

I like to think of spacetime in the Doctor Who universe as kinda like a sturdy rope bridge. Fixed points are integral sections of the bridge's structure. Break one of them and, potentially, the whole universe could come crashing down. Paradoxes are like damaging non-essential sections of the bridge. Depending on how you damage it, where you damage it and how often you damage it might result in different effects.

My own fan-rationalization of the reapers is that they're just scavengers who wander the universe looking to feed on the energy of broken timelines. To require them to show up at every single paradox or broken fixed point would require them to be omniscient. Sometimes they'll be close enough to swoop in and feast, other times they won't.",0,1345484494,null,0,false,0,c5w1y57,t3_yiom5,t1_c5w1y57,t1_c5w0zg0,null,1429688949,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

In stuff like The Big Bang, The Doctor gives Rory the sonic screwdriver, who gives it to the Doctor, who gives it to Rory...who gives it to the Doctor, etc.  The moment does not explode.  (It's a neat little loop.)

It's backed up a lot in the show that the Doctor can't cross his own timestream - this is why.

I failed my first test within 1 minute of getting in the car (no joke) and passed on my second test with 2 minors. I don't believe i was really a better driver in any way the second time, I was just more at ease that day. A lot of competent driving is just experience and confidence.

**Changes to the test**

I learned over a period of about 3 years, this was disrupted by going away to uni so I actually have a pretty good idea of how it's changed over that time. The big thing is that you now have to do something called independent driving instead of a second maneuver and you may also be asked to do an emergency stop aswell (piece of cake). This independent driving consists of either being told a series of instructions (eg, first right, straight on at the roundabout then 2nd right) or told to follow signs for a destination. The great thing? If you go the wrong way then it is the examiners responsibility to get you back onto the route and they can't mark you down for it (although putting an examiner in a bad mood with you is an unexcellent idea).

And allow economic development in the area (Cardiff Bay has been a massive success and there is no reason to think it won't be the same with the severn on a larger scale). 

When they rejected it a few years ago (based on cost) they compared the price with nuclear. And nuclear won. However, they only used a 25 years time scale for both, which is ridiculous because the barrage will generate for 100 years, nukes would have to be replaced 3 times over that timescale. They also used a 47% price overrun for the barrage and 15% for nuclear. 

It also improves the countries asset base, against which the government can borrow money in the future. 

We should allow sovereign wealth funds to invest and pay them a fair price for the leccy over 25 years, then enjoy a further 75 years of essentially free power.

true,hybridtheorist,null,"Leeds, YORKSHIRE","&gt; I think you are speaking in hyperbole

which part? I'm afraid I genuinely believe there is a (small but still sizeable) minority on Reddit who truly think that the issue of false rape accusations is a bigger problem than rape itself. I'm not suggesting that ""everyone in Mens Rights thinks that way"" or anything like that, it's a small portion of that group and others like them, but plenty of people on this site seem to speak out about ""cry wolf"" cases ten times more than they do about rape.

If a truly black and white case comes up like the recent Rochdale sex gang, the comment becomes ""it's so unfair that society thinks this is the same as some drunk guy fucking a drunk girl/some 18 year old fucking his 17 year old girlfriend"".

Couple of months ago I had an argument with some guy who said that all it took to get a rape conviction in his state was for the woman to say she'd been raped. [trawled through my comment history and found it](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w35ua/update_my_girlfriend_of_25_years_told_me_if_i/c59vddq)  
Actual quote is: 
&gt; if you require conclusive evidence for rape everyone would get away with it. to protect women, they're basically taken at their word.

I found this post via subredditdrama just today [so I didn't even have to try for this one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/antisrs/comments/yftmo/i_tried_i_tried_to_honestly_and_openly_engage/c5vc1eu)

I'm not suggesting for one second that false rape accusations aren't a problem, with innocent men being tarred with ""there's no smoke without fire"", and some even being found guilty, plus real rape victims finding it more difficult to be believed, and so on. But really, have you ever seen a post on reddit about rape that didn't have a ""but what about the poor men in all of this?"" line? 

EDIT - in hindsight, maybe it was hyperbole a bit. my view is not that they're saying ""who cares about rape, the real issue is rape accusations!"". it's more a dismissiveness about the issue. kind of ""yes, yes, we all know rape is terrible, blah blah blah, but lets look at the REAL issue here....""",0,1345486479,null,0,1345499459,0,c5w2kmr,t3_ygsgd,t1_c5w2kmr,t1_c5w1ao4,null,1429689236,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Good point. I think the key difference between ""tiki-taka"" of the Spaincelona variety and Rodgers' system is that Rodgers utilises the counter-attack far more; the first thing players do when they regain possession is look to see if there is a counter-attacking option on, and counter-attacks usually involve feeding the ball to someone who provides penetration and directness - in this case, our fullbacks, although the front three will try to break the offside trap a fair bit as well.

In comparison, Barca's (main) use of Dani Alves (and now Jordi Alba) is not for initiating a counter-attack (they do this sometimes, sure), but to join in towards the end of a move or once the team is in the final third to provide width and stretch play; that's part of the reason why Alves was much less effective starting high up as a right winger in a 3-4-3 diamond in comparison to running from deep. Man City do something similar with Clichy/Kolarov and Zabaleta/Richards providing width in the final third to make up for Silva &amp; Nasri as inverted wingers.

Real wing-backs would be ideal, sure, but given that I don't see it happening this window, I hope Rodgers can improve Kelly's offensive output.",0,1345489413,null,0,false,0,c5w3h6f,t3_y1nhx,t1_c5w3h6f,t1_c5w2xdi,null,1429689733,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,jaysabi,tardis,TARDIS,"I just want to further clarify my post a bit. A paradox is an actual impossible situation. Not that it just appears impossible because of a linear interpretation of time, but an actual impossible situation. If I travel back in time to kill my father before I was born, I can never travel back in time to kill my father. But if I just killed him, we have two sets of contradictory facts. That my father cannot be killed by me, and that I killed him. The fact that they are both true is a paradox. This type of paradox is what damages time in Father's Day and causes the reapers to spawn to heal the wound in time.

My point about the linear interpretation of time is that the ontological paradoxes (for example where the Doctor escapes the Pandorica by virtue of already having escaped the Pandorica) appears to be a paradox because we're viewing the events in linear order; a ""future"" Doctor gives Rory the sonic screwdriver to let him out of the Pandorica, so that he can give Rory the sonic screwdriver to let The Doctor out of the Pandorica. My point is that this must only appear to be a paradox and cannot actually be one, and as evidence, I'm citing the fact that as viewers we're told that time does not happen linearly, that only Time Lords can truly understand how time operates (hence the absence of a full, satisfactory explanation), and the fact that there is no consequence to the apparent paradox (reapers or time dying) which suggests further that it is not an actual paradox.

Now, on the fixed points: as you say, they cannot be altered. But when River refuses to kill The Doctor a fixed point WAS altered. So once again, we have two sets of contradictory facts: a fixed point can never be altered, and a fixed point was altered; a paradox. But this one is so large that time actually starts dying. 

I like your bridge analogy. I have always viewed fixed points as though all of time revolves around them, which is why there is such a dramatic consequence to altering one. It would be as if the sun suddenly disappeared, our planet would spin off into space in utter chaos.

I agree with your reasoning but I don't see why it should be called a paradox. A paradox usually refers to a string of cause and effect that cannot happen due to two contradictory facts. A fixed point is not a string of cause and effect. It does not have two or more contradictory facts. A fixed point is just 1 event in spacetime that cannot be altered.

It teaches people the power of compassion and forgiveness through a man who ""never would"". It contains so much details and lessons below the skin for those who want to look but can be perfectly understood and enjoyed by those who just want a good time.

Know that the first season especially has a lot of cheese and low budget but it's got some great stories in it and will fill in a lot of the blanks you will have if you start randomly in the series.

Also if you are set on picking random episodes and not watching from the beginning try to avoid Smith (11th doctor seasons 5-7), I don't say this because he's bad because he's not I really enjoy him I say this because his episodes are much more strung together than previous seasons.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"There actually *is* a subreddit for those just interested in discussion, called /r/gallifrey, and it is used by quite a bit of us. The problem isn't that we want a place where there are only self posts, or purely discussion, but we want somewhere that has quality posts. Unfortunately, the majority of posts here are literally the same posts repackaged over and over again, week after week. This is why it was simply a meme free week, instead of a self.post week. Anyone that just wants that already frequents /r/gallifrey.

And, to cover your other comment towards me, I think the fact that people don't participate is exactly why they shouldn't matter. I mean, yeah the upvote system is great, but it also has its flaws. I mean, if people started posting porn to this subreddit, and it got upvoted, would you still say that the upvotes should decide? The fact of the matter is that these fly-by-night upvoters are ruining the subreddit for those of us that actually participate in the community, and it doesn't really matter to them what happens with this subreddit, otherwise you'd see them in here with much greater numbers arguing for meme posts. I mean, the kind of posts we're arguing against literally get upvotes into the thousands, so where are those thousands of people now?

It's like this, imagine your town has elections coming up, and there are two candidates for mayor. One everyone is feverishly excited for, is promising, and will be a great breath of fresh air for the community. The other, to put it bluntly, couldn't tie his shoes if they were velcro. However, election day comes and your town is flooded with non-residential people that aren't a part of your community, and they all vote for the guy wearing unlaced velcro shoes, then immediately take off as soon as election day is over.

Those people are now no longer in the community to deal with the repercussions of what they did, nor do they care, and now its left the community with a crappy mayor. All because 'Everyone should be allowed to vote'.

That's exactly what is happening here. People who have no investment in the community are mass voting low quality submissions that have been voted on dozens of times in the past, and the only ones suffering are the people who are actively trying to participate in the community, because they're far outweighed by the fly-by-night voters that couldn't give two shits about this community, but will upvote Eccleston dancing, or Tennant in the rain every fucking time they're posted.",0,1345497759,null,0,false,0,c5w5y26,t3_yhssi,t1_c5w5y26,t1_c5w5byy,null,1429690902,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

Using some crest as representing every 'Jones' family would be like imposing a single town motto on every Springfield in America.

Because Jones is a patronymic name, i.e. its a name created a few hundred years ago to mean ""son of John"", there is no ""Jones Family"" in Wales. There are lots of families with the surname Jones, but since its one of the most common surnames, none of them are related. 

While there might be a Jones family with a crest, it's very unlikely you are descended from them especially since family crests are a relatively rare thing to have.

These days, companies make ""fake"" crests for families to appeal to people searching their family tree. It's likely that the crest in the photo is one of these artificially made ones.

Her advice is to get a tattoo of one of the symbols of Wales. The Welsh Dragon is pretty bitching.

Either The Doctor was wrong about it being a fixed point (he sounds unsure, as if Fixed Points are just a theory and not a law) or the death is a fixed point which still happens, just in a different location. If you pause the episode to look at the newspaper headlines after Adelaide commits suicide, they say: Hero's Mysterious Death - Alien Intervention?"" There are photos of Mia &amp; Yuri with the title ""Mars Survivors"" and then another story headline: ""Brooke Saved Earth. Daughter pledges to continue her work.""  

And if you remember why it was supposed to be a fixed point to begin with, Adelaide's death inspires her daughter to go into the human space program, and she becomes the pilot of the first lightspeed ship, which is when the humans start colonizing space. Without Adelaide's death, that doesn't happen. So it is only the death related to that Mars mission that is the fixed point, not the actual dying on Mars.

This to me is the most interesting aspect then, because you have The Doctor believing he just altered a fixed point and that the laws of time were his to use as he saw fit, and Adelaide asks him, ""Is there nothing that can stop you?"" And he responds, ""Not anymore."" And she gives him this look as she leaves and goes into her house, and that's when she kills herself. And this is conjecture now, but I believe she did that to humble him, to destroy the Time Lord Victorious because it was wrong, to restore all the things he ruined because he convinced her of the necessity of her death and the fixed point, and that's what makes this episode outstanding, is seeing The Doctor grapple with these issues.",0,1345500116,null,0,false,0,c5w6ll3,t3_yiom5,t1_c5w6ll3,t1_c5w3kj8,null,1429691201,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

**POLICE LOG**

**Neasden Police Station**

* 8.00hrs

All officers were redeployed from normal duties onto Operation Twitterwatch, monitoring suspicious and criminal tweeting activity over the Olympic period. 115 60-inch plasma-screen television sets were installed in the station, to enable officers to correlate tweets and Olympic-related events.

* 10.30hrs

First major tweet alert recorded while officers were watching heats of 20-kilometre kayak time trial at Hampton Court. PC Brondesbury picked up tweet from member of the public, Kev94 sending message concerning failure of GB's competitor Matt Coracle to qualify for quarter-finals because of collision with marker pole. Our ""Tweet Detectives"", headed by Sergeant Hainault, subjected the message to forensic examination and concluded that its wording ""stick pole up your arse Matt you wanker and then drop dead"" was a clear incitement to murder and an offence under the Terrorism and Allied Offences Act 2006.

* 11.45hrs

Armed ""Tweet Swat Team"" was ordered to track down and arrest the suspect Kev94. Following exhaustive investigation (i.e. asking Twitter to give us his address), the suspect was identified as Kevin Snott residing at Flat 412, the Tessa Jowell Estate, Poundstretcher Road. 317 officers surrounded the suspect's address and after breaking down the door of his bedsitter, managed to disarm him of his mobile phone, which was retained as evidence, and placed him under arrest. Suspect put up a brief resistance, necessitating use of taser and pepper spray, but no live rounds were required, in accordance with the new guidelines on Avoidance of Killing Civilians Unless Strictly Necessary.

* 13.15hrs

Suspect was detained in custody at Neasden Central and charged with five criminal offences relating to his tweet before being discharged.

* 13.30 - 21.00

Officers celebrated successful operation by continuing to monitor Olympic sporting events in alternative venue viz the Slug and Lettuce in Pricerite Avenue.

* 21.00

Duty Officer Sgt Kenningtom returned to the station to find emergency answerphone full of messages from members of public reporting incidents of burglary, theft, assault, domestic violence, and murder. Sgt deleted all low-priority requests for assistance, i.e. all of the messages and tweeted to followers: ""Police cannot cope with huge increase in workload due to Twitter Crime"".",0,1345505837,null,0,1345506981,0,c5w82r8,t3_yj19j,t1_c5w82r8,t1_c5w05lk,null,1429691898,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Not true. They're better, but not much, let alone much, much. You have a skewed perspective of the gulf of class. The top 4-5 are ""much, much better"" than the 4 behind them, which are slightly better than the following four and so on.

As an aside, is the gulf of class between Everton and Man U larger than that between WBA and Liverpool? Emphatically yes. So to harp on about the subjective qualities of Everton misses the entire point of roobens' comment, which is that ""better"" teams get beaten by ""inferior"" opposition all the time, and Liverpool aren't some terrible example of this.

true,apopo-dapalle,k9,K-9,"Doctor Who, for me, has varied and evolved over the years...

I started out watching (badly) Italian dubbed Tom Baker-starring re-runs on Saturday afternoons. At that time, the Doctor inspired a love of adventure, cool use of knowledge and a no-nonsense approach to life. I also admired his enormous self-confidence and easy trust/belief in others.

When the series came back in '05, the 9th Doctor was quite a change for me. He was cool, even more irritatingly vague in his theories/explanations, fast and...for lack of a better word, *rough*. Like sandpaper: sometimes it scrapes your skin, at other times it feels rough but doesn't cause pain. I found that he wasn't the happy, silly Doctor who didn't mind gallivanting about prior to getting down to business. He didn't have as much joie-de-vivre as before, he acted like someone who had lost more than he could bear and simply went through the motions. Yes he still laughed but I found it to be a tightly wound/controlled laugh, not something which bubbles up unexpectedly/naturally.

Regeneration into the 10th Doctor showed me a man who was making his best efforts to move forward and maintain his joyful curiosity and love for life. Sometimes you would get a glimpse of the frighteningly powerful and suffering individual behind the mask, but it was a rare flash. This insight became more and more pronounced towards the end of the 5th season. It was the hardest one for me as the Doctor stopped being the time lord, the hero, the traveller, the teacher. He was stripped down to his most basic, natural essence: a man who had suffered, loved, laughed, cried. A creature just as susceptible to desires and base impulses as any other, like us. The Doctor exposed himself to the core: he was scared.

11th regeneration: the Doctor got up, put aside his fears and reluctance. He resumed his travels, striving to re-discover the joys of exploration, imagination, understanding. The journey in which one must put aside fears/hesitation and continue to put one foot in front of the other, one step at a time, open mind ready to be challenged.

It may sound sad/silly/ridiculous, but the Doctor has been an important part of my life. Growing up where technology is built to bring us closer, yet we daily lose basic social interaction. Where the world is more connected than ever yet still struggles with the same issues of violence and ignorance like 50, 80, 100, 200 years ago. 

It's reminded me that we are never alone, whether living through emotional/physical hurdles, triumphs, or simple pleasures. That we can overcome obstacles by trying, by not looking back, by keeping our minds open in order to evolve. In order to continue to learn, continue to attempt to grasp new concepts and ideals and try to be the best that we can be. I believe in the Doctor's philosophy AND his acceptance of mortality. 

Before some of you freak out on me, yes, the Doctor is a ""fictional"" character... Yet I'd like to remind you that every single ""supreme being"", ""leader"" if you must, of known religious ordinances have as much proof of their existence as the Doctor. I choose to take a leaf out of this wonderful character's book, I try to embrace life, with it's accompanying joy and misery, with an open mind and a reminder that I am brilliant, even if I am one amongst billions, I am unique. You are all brilliant and unique.

Study the ‘Apocalypse Equation’ thesis written years ago by Malthusian, Audrey Tomason the current U.S. Director for Counter-Terrorism. This has all been planned and it is one of the reasons why the Department of Energy is so well connected to the medical mafia these days.

Chernobyl was the real kick-start of this plan to aid the reduction of the global populace in accordance with the Global 2000 Report of the Club of Rome fronted by the Peccei family. Do not believe the uranium shells being used today are depleted, they are radioactive and spreading radiation Worldwide whilst destroying genetics of races such as the Iraqis.

Study what happened to many populaces around the West after the Chernobyl disaster which resulted in the increase in thyroid destruction of both animals and people along with alarming cancer rates. Cancer rates that are as if one is now catching a regular cold. All whilst the dumbed down populaces do not ask questions and do not know the past.

Now you have Fukushima so ask yourself what will happen in the next few years onwards from the deadliest nuclear disaster of all time. How else can you have population reduction at the level and timeframe desired without mass bloodshed and wars on all lands? Now can you see whats happening? How often do you hear about Fukushima now? Never? Are you not suspicious since it was the deadliest nuclear disaster of all time?

Watch as diabetes goes through the roof since both diseases stem from damage to the Spleen by radiation and it’s the Spleen which controls the pancreas fighting both cancer (proteolytic enzymes) and diabetes (Insulin). Watch as more girls are born compared to boys also aiding population balance problems and population reduction. Do not believe media lies that there will be more boys than girls, it’s lies and nonsense but the result is the same. Watch as you eventually see so many more cancer patients lining up for their poison treatment by chemo not in hospitals but in high-street pharmacies like Boots. Chemo which will kill the patient far quicker than any Cancer and with a lot less dignity. All to profit The Worshipful Company of Apothecaries and The Worshipful Company of Barbers running the medical mafia acting as the veiled inquisition for the Malthusian, Committee of 300.

true,Signe,clara,Clara,"&gt; For what is allowed, as outlined by this post(original artwork, cosplay, look who I ran into)I think there exists a slippery slope that we need to try and nip in the bud, and have those things fall under 'If you have original content that falls under these categories, feel free to post it'. Otherwise I think we'll be back to square one with people just reposting other people's celebrity encounters, cosplays, etc. Otherwise I think we'll eventually just have the same 'Look who I ran into while wearing my TARDIS cosplay!' picture posted every other week.

I find a good general rule of thumb (for lots of places on reddit, but it seems especially true here) is that if you didn't create it, you shouldn't post it.  Whether that's artwork, or blogs, or whatever.  It's not a strict rule - obviously we want to hear about news and new products and the like and it's unlikely that people on this sub are creating those, but it should be the first thing that someone thinks about before posting anywhere.  ""Did I create this?  Has it been posted before?""

""Create"" should be taken liberally - meaning created the image, or you're in the image, or it's something you [or your significant-other/friend/life-partner/etc.] drew/wrote/baked/whatever.

Again, everyone on here seems to complain about things, but they don't post what they want to see on here.

* News/Review - I constantly see news on here, reviews sometimes. However, reviews are more suited towards a separate website.

* Merchandise - Why not an official DW store? We even have shirts and whatnot occasionally posted here

* Art - Constantly on the frontpage here

* General Discussion - Again, constantly see it on the frontpage, usually about episodes or the cast. I don't see how you can miss it.

* Personal stories - AGAIN, I see personal stories all the time

* Trivia - Tardis Wiki, makes its way into .self threads/comments anyway

* Theories/Hypotheticals - Same as 'general discussion'

* Photos of cast/cons - Frequently posted here

Either we have two completely different frontpages, or you've missed out on a lot. Almost all of what you listed is already on the frontpage just about every day, so I say let a few screencaps on it now and then. New episodes aren't being played yet, so of course there will be less .self/discussion posts. That's simply how Reddit works. 

Sorry, but it just seems like nitpicking to me.

true,hollykins,tardis,TARDIS,"Generally, the best place to start for a new Whovian is somewhere in the Eccleston era. Many suggest starting with ""Rose,"" the first episode of series 1 of Doctor Who. That's Eccleston. And that's great! But I started with ""The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances"" two-parter, watched s1 out of order, and still loved it, so I think as long as you start there you'll be good! 

Basically: The Doctor is a Time Lord, a man who can change his body whenever he is mortally wounded. He travels around time and space in his TARDIS (his ship, but she is so much more than a ship... you'll see) with his best friends. So... that little starter should help you get through most episodes! 

One other thing: Netflix sorts the DW stuff a little oddly. All of the classic era stuff is separate, for example, but a few other things are too. I'll list everything in order that's under the 'Doctor Who' page but star the stuff you'll need to search for on Netflix separately.

1) Series 1 (Christopher Eccleston + Billie Piper)

*If you can find the Children in Need special that bridges Series 1 and 2, watch it! Just look for the one from 2005.

2) Series 2 (David Tennant + Billie Piper)

3) Series 3 (David Tennant + Freema Agyeman)

*Another cute Children in Need special here. It's called Time Crash.

4) Series 4 (David Tennant + Catherine Tate)

*Planet of the Dead (David Tennant)

*The Waters of Mars (David Tennant)

*The End of Time, pt 1 &amp; 2 (David Tennant's swan song - Netflix probably has pts 1 &amp; 2 together)

5) Series 5 (Matt Smith, Karen Gillan)

*And another Children in Need special here. Space/Time - two parts.

6) Series 6 (Matt Smith, Karen Gillan, and Arthur Darvill)

Sorry! This is a lot of information, I know. I am just excited whenever anyone starts watching Who :D 

EDIT: A fine person below me also pointed out the Christmas specials! Those are indeed bundled with each season of DW on Netflix so you shouldn't miss them, but they are: 

The Christmas Invasion (2005 - included with Series 2. The Children in Need special from 2005 provides a bridge from the last episode of series 1 riiight into The Christmas Invasion.)

The Runaway Bride (2006 - included with Series 3) 

Voyage of the Damned (2007 - included with Series 4)

The Next Doctor (! Apparently this 2008 Christmas special is included with series 4 and not separately like I thought. The other Tennant specials before his departure are still separate.)

The Christmas Carol (2010 - included with series 5)

The Doctor, the Widow, and The Wardrobe (2011 - included with series 6)

If their current focus isn't on arresting or cautioning pot smokers, i.e. they're dealing with something more serious or have a more important task in mind then unless the person is being a complete arse about it (and that tends to mean a lack of discretion, if you're going to break the law then don't make a show of it) then they'll probably be left alone.

It's all a bit vague but applies to most low level crime, you may be tasked with enforcing the law but you'll find doing so at the expense of handling the more serious/pressing stuff isn't likely, depending on your character of course and your ability to do two jobs at once.  

A good example is handling the saturday night ruckus on every high street in the country, wasting time shopping people for a crafty spliff  isn't worth it over keeping an eye on the violent drunks, the alcohol poisoned and the vandals.

true,tottenhamhotsauce,num8,,"More then we know obviously, but the squad is under a metamorphosis with avb at the helm. Think of it like that, we are a cocoon that ideally will blossom into a contender. The way avb speaks about the squad publicly(which we know) and the way he speaks to them during training(which we don't know) has certain impacts both positive and negative. For example, if he promotes JD as a laudable figure publicly, it provides incentive for him to produce privately, which in turn demands that people raise to a certain higher level. This means they must listen to avb's instruction as to how the squad moves offensively and defensively. Not only does it raise the level of competition in training, it promotes the metamorphosis avb wants, as they need to listen to him in order to maintain the goal. Obviously someone in training cam shut jd down, but what is important is that they shut jd down in a way that filters well into avb's system. Obviously this takes time, but as we all know, if you push the right buttons at the right time you see not only an increase in performance but a will to understanding. I am, without a doubt speaking ideally, but as we say, to dare is to do. This is what avb is doing. Further, I have said this before, and I still mean it, when avb shows up on the pitch with his ua warmups all nice and embroidered, he shows both a willingness to get his hands 'dirty'(Would you wipe shit in a suit? No... at least I wouldn't... not saying the club is shit but you get the idea) and a subtle attitude to out himself on the player level, it makes him appear more hands on rather than oversight. Further, the way he is coy about transfer prospects seeks to placate the public and stir up the itk's to generate excitement, which means that if the itk's are wrong it falls on their shoulder rather than the club. This achieves two things: one, the squad is unified under their manager because he believes in them, and while he might be hopeful for additional signing, they are his to manage, and two, he is not guilty of rumor mongering, which can backfire for a manager when it comes to squad moral. He is trying to establish the belief that the squad he has is not only good enough for him, but it is good enough to compete.

true,dayus9,eng-gloucestershire,Lincs,"It depends if you mean English as a first or second language. I'll address both as I find it an interesting topic. 

As a first language its because their English has evolved differently to ours and they have kept older words we don't use much. Sometimes their language has developed to include different spellings or even different words, we brits then bitch that they're not speaking proper English, and if they use old fashioned English word we think that's weird too. It's just language evolving in different cultures. 

As for those who have English as a second language, the main people who do it are those who have formally learned English in schools rather than from exposure to the language as it's spoken here, or at least their base for the language came before proper exposure.

 A lot of their vocabulary (quite rightly) comes from language dictionaries. As they're learning the language they see a word in their own language, look it up in English, and more often than not they'll be presented with several synonyms. You just can't learn them all at first, so you pick one that is the easiest to remember, that word just stays with you forever, you automatically use it. How are you to know it's a bit old fashioned? 

If they eventually come over to the UK their use of other words and slang will improve, but that base they set up for themselves using dictionaries stays with them and they will always use a few words that sound a bit weird to us. 

I did Farsi at university and have the same problem, I use some proper old fashioned words when I'm speaking it, because those were the ones I learned before I was good enough to have a proper conversation, and there are some fucking terrible foreign language dictionaries out there. 

Apologies for spellings and for switching 3rd person and 2nd person around a bit, I'm on my phone and it's a pain to change it now. ",0,1345535372,null,0,1345536173,0,c5weov9,t3_yjfn0,t1_c5weov9,t3_yjfn0,null,1429695084,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

- If successful hospitals have the time to ""spread their expertise"", they should be spreading it to less successful hospitals in the UK.
- It means more money spend on advertising and marketing; which in turn means less on nursing.
- The entire thing is a distraction. How about letting them get on with their actual jobs? Giving them a goal of making money shifts their focus away from looking after people.
- Even if it did work on a large scale, you've still got a one in, one out problem. If you send 30 staff to Kansas then you've got to hire 30 locums to cover their jobs in the UK. You might manage to make a proft... but locums are expensive. Your margins are going to be very small. It's really not going to be worth the time, effort and disruption. Andrew Lansley's private healthcare outfits will make out like bandits though.
- The whole thing is probably a cover for cuts. If you send 20% of the staff abroad and charge for them, you effectively get your money back.

Just because a person consents to sex once, it does not mean that they automatically give blanket consent to sex indefinitely. It certainly does not imply consent to unprotected sex while sleeping.

I am not saying that Assange is definitely guilty because he hasn't faced trial yet, but Galloway implied that the basis of the accusations themselves do not constitute an act of rape. 

Edit: It seems that Galloway is now backtracking and ""clarifying his statement"", so just to be clear, here is part of what he said:

[""Even taken at its worst, if the allegations made by these two women were true, 100% true, and even if a camera in the room captured them, they don't constitute rape.""](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/20/george-galloway-julian-assange-rape)

The allegations themselves are as follows - see from http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/Misc/2011/5.html:

&gt; 1. On 13th – 14th August 2010, in the home of the injured party [name given] in Stockholm, 
Assange, by using violence, forced the injured party to endure his restricting her freedom of 
movement. The violence consisted in a firm hold of the injured party’s arms and a forceful 
spreading of her legs whilst lying on top of her and with his body weight preventing her from 
moving or shifting. 

&gt; 2. On 13th – 14th August 2010, in the home of the injured party [name given] in Stockholm, Assange 
deliberately molested the injured party by acting in a manner designed to violate her sexual 
integrity. Assange, who was aware that it was the expressed wish of the injured party and a 
prerequisite of sexual intercourse that a condom be used, consummated unprotected sexual 
intercourse with her without her knowledge. 

&gt; 3. On 18th August 2010 or on any of the days before or after that date, in the home of the injured 
party [name given] in Stockholm, Assange deliberately molested the injured party by acting in a 
manner designed to violate her sexual integrity i.e. lying next to her and pressing his naked, 
erect penis to her body. 

&gt; 4. On 17th August 2010, in the home of the injured party [name given] in Enkoping, Assange 
deliberately consummated sexual intercourse with her by improperly exploiting that she, due to 
sleep, was in a helpless state. 

&gt; It is an aggravating circumstance that Assange, who was aware that it was the expressed wish 
of the injured party and a prerequisite of sexual intercourse that a condom be used, still 
consummated unprotected sexual intercourse with her. The sexual act was designed to violate 
the injured party’s sexual integrity. 

Now it's one thing to question the integrity of the women, or to question whether there is a likelihood of a successful conviction.

&gt;Some people believe that when you go to bed with somebody, take off your clothes, and have sex with them and then fall asleep, you're already in the sex game with them.  It might be really bad manners not to have tapped her on the shoulder and said, 'do you mind if I do it again?'  It might be really sordid and bad sexual etiquette, but **whatever else it is, it is not rape or you bankrupt the term rape of all meaning.**  
  
While I think that you're not necessarily committing rape - or even sexual assault of any kind - if you don't get explicit permission for every act of sexual intercourse you engage in, I completely disagree with his statement that a one night stand is essentially an invitation for as much sex as one party wants until you part.  Frankly I find that to be a monumentally stupid and disrespectful comment.  The right to say no, even once sex has started, is fundamental for everybody involved in every sex act.  
  
It's different if you're in a relationship with somebody, and that's just what the two of you have come to understand as acceptable within your mutually agreed boundaries, even if just implicitly.  But in the case of somebody you've just met, or at least who you've only slept with for the first time, then unless it has been specifically brought up that this is something your partner would find acceptable, then any normal person would have no reason to believe that they had consent to do it.

Reasons it may happen:

 * Real are desperate to dislodge part of his wages from their books to make room for new signings
 * They would let him go for free but nobody can handle his wages, so they may have to resort to paying up 50% of his wages on a year-long loan deal.

I think what will happen here is that the closer and closer we get to the end of the window the better the terms will become for any club looking to take him away. Eventually somebody will bite when the deal gets juicy.

As an NHS manager, I often have to make difficult decisions regarding the allocation of limited funds.

For instance, recently I had to make a choice: spend 250 thousand pounds on experimental cancer treatment to possibly save the life of a single child, or spend it on proven treatment for ten adult alcoholics with self-inflicted liver disease.

In the end I spent it on a new sculpture for the foyer, to show visitors that our hospital is a centre for excellence.

I asked my girlfriend for a blow job last night.

She said, ""And what am I getting out of it?""

""A mouthful of cum probably,"" I replied.

Apparently, some people can only get an erection if alcohol is involved.

Fat chicks, mostly.

Once one shop opens long hours, all the others will have to. In the same way as no pub would enforce non smoking inside until all the rest did, which was never. This is where the free market fails.       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons    

Independent stores could be very profitable and offer very high levels of service, but there is a problem with competing against very large shops/chains. Let's look at Starbucks. Their typical strategy is to crush independent cafes. They do this by opening up so many stores in a given area that they are even cannibalising sales from their own stores. They can afford to take this loss because they have plenty of other shops around the world which *are* generating profit. Eventually the independent shops have to close, at which point Starbucks can close down it's extra stores and start to ramp prices up. http://www.starbucksunion.org/node/363     


I guess the choice is between getting friendly service from a local shop or being served by a drone in a clone town. I'm guessing the latter will win as all Brits care about is ""what's the cheapest?"" I'm not saying that smaller shops are always better but do you really want the UK to be like Bicester?      http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1540392/Bicester-the-town-Tescod-six-times-over.html      


France is dominated by big box stores yet still has thriving town centres with large squares and avenues - which tourists also flock to (strange how they don't flock to the big box out of town places) They are also largely closed at lunchtime and closed on Sundays and many even on Mondays

My point about the IEA and indeed 'think tanks' in general is that they are a sham. They're just a front for political parties, in this case the Conservatives who are more interested in free market 'fast buck making' than in individual employees rights or the long term effects of destroying town centres. http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/2011/09/the_curse_of_tina.html

(1)A person (A) commits an offence if—

(a)he intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person (B) with his penis,

(b)B does not consent to the penetration, and

(c)A does not reasonably believe that B consents

The case against Assange is that he was given consent for sex as long as he was wearing a condom. He is alleged to have had sex whilst not wearing a condom. His guilt is for the courts to decide, of course Swedish law is different from English law. 

The salient points seem to me are - does not applying with the consent laid down by B constitute a withdrawal of consent and therefore the offence of rape? [Section 76](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/part/1/crossheading/supplementary-and-general) of the Sexual Offence act certainly leads me (no lawyer) to believe that intentionally deceiving 'B' is unlawful. The second point is could Assange have reasonably believed she would have given consent to sex with him not wearing a condom? As her consent was explicit in him wearing a condom this is unlikely. 

Guilt can of course only be determined in court, however grounds for arrest and for him to be charged looks fairly ironclad.

And that difference seems to be lost on some people. Having sex with your partner while she is asleep after you know it's OK and that she enjoys it is entirely different to doing the same with someone you've only started having sex with a few hours back. If it's someone new, then some indication that consent is given is always required. 

Also, there is a difference between men and women when it comes to sex. Firstly, I've not been with a women I couldn't easily pick up and carry about at will (aside from the big lass, but we don't talk about that even if she was loads of fun), and I'm not Mr Muscle. Where as at 6'2"" and 100kg, not many women could move me if I was on top of them, and neither could the fight me off if I wanted to go for it. And then there is the whole difference between being penetrated and doing the penetration. 

The condom issue is important as well, if someone is keen on bareback sex and it's the first time you've slept with them, then it's highly likely that this won't be the first time they've had sex without protection with a new partner. And this is a concern in itself. It's also worth noting that the women only went to the police to force Assange to get tested, as he was refusing to do so. 

But the clincher is that one of the women resisted, and he held her down. Unless it's some sort of pre-agreed rape fantasy involving safe words, this isn't something you do.

true,KaChilde,capaldi,Capaldi,"The major issue for a developer would be gameplay mechanics. The game needs to feel like an episode of Doctor Who, while still being accessible enough for new gamers and children, who are still Doctor Who's target audience. Can't do an fps, because The Doctor is (mostly) anti-weapon. And as far as appealing to a wide audience, that leaves the puzzler genre. In theory it fits. the Doctor outsmarts his foes weekly. He doesn't need to shoot a cyberman, because he can trick them into destroying themselves... But We've seen scores of puzzler Doctor Who games, and they're all rather sub-par.

On top of this, there is no character progression available when you play as the madman with a box that can travel anywhere in time and space, the dual-hearted alien that knows everything and has created convoluted plots to avoid his preordained murder. Why is this legendary man pushing crates to open doors in Aztec temples, while trying not to walk directly into the Dalek that has been circling the room for the last 10 minutes? You can't level up The Doctor without SERIOUSLY underpowering him in the early levels, and that wouldn't feel right.

 I don't think a major publisher could ever make a good Doctor Who game.

If I could have a Doctor Who game, it would only be Whovian in spirit. You would start as a novice Time Lord, trapped in the Time War with the rest of your race. As the game begins, something wobbly wobbly leaves a crack in the lock on the War, and you find yourself stealing a TARDIS and escaping. The rest of the game is relatively open world, with options to use physical violence, or cunning to defeat your enemies: Daleks, Cybermen, Silence, Weeping Angels, and the villainous Time Lords that have also escaped the Time War. Throw in The Doctor (in all his incarnations through time and space) as an optional ally, or villain if you decide he needs to be knocked down a peg or two, and you've got my money. 

I know there's a lot missing in my brief, and I doubt a major publisher, or the BBC would agree to a lisenced Who game that allows violence. But I can dream.",0,1345547179,null,0,false,0,c5wfwrm,t3_ykoig,t1_c5wfwrm,t3_ykoig,null,1429695665,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

Third woman basically agrees with the government. She calls for lower taxes on business, which is exactly what Osborne announced in the last budget - aiming to make the UK the lowest corporation tax in Europe so that more people will do business here.

4th guy didn't say much at all really. He basically thinks Osborne is doing an ok job and advises spending more on infrastructure and technology, which I think we are doing in some areas.

6th girl doesn't say much of importance apart from to improve quality of life for people and increase public spending. But IMO, those two things aren't mutually dependent. Can the general public only be happy as the recipient of government assistance? That's a depressing thought for our country.

7th guy basically says they inherited the mess from Labour.

My own view is that NOBODY is out of recession yet. We are all too interlinked, and even Germany and France (the supposedly strong economies) are still in trouble because of Greece/Italy/Spain/Portugal. So until some country emerges from recession, you can't say that austerity or spending is the right or wrong decision because we simply don't know the outcome yet.

All I'd say is that the austerity clearly sucks, but we have paid off over 1/3 of national debt, inflation is lower, and household savings have gone up. Hopefully in the long run that will make us more stable and will be better insurance against something like this happening again.

First up, current accounts are not profitable in the uk. Current account transactions take up loads of expensive counter time in branches, and incur hefty it costs for online banking. Banks only let you have free accounts in order to sell you credit cards or loans.

Secondly, the penalty charges which make up most current account revenue are grossly unfair. They are paid mostly by the banks poorer customers, who are in effect subsidising banking for the wealthy.

Switching to a monthly fee model would be a good way to reflect the true costs, and reduce the pressure to mis-sell other products. If you only use online banking fees would be £1-2 a month, whereas if you use the branches a lot expect to pay £10-20. I would have thought most Redditors would be better off with £20 a year fees and no penalties?

The banks I've worked with recognise that the free + unfair penalties system sucks, and would love to switch to monthly fees.

This means that under UK law in this scenario ""the complainant is to be taken not to have consented to the relevant act unless sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue as to whether he consented, and the defendant is to be taken not to have reasonably believed that the complainant consented unless sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue as to whether he reasonably believed it.""

In layman's terms, this means that essentially if the victim was asleep when you penetrated, you pretty much need to provide proof that she very clearly said yes beforehand or it's presumed that there was no consent. Furthermore reasonable belief in consent where it doesn't exist is incredibly hard to prove at all, never mind in such a situation where it's presumed that reasonable belief can't exist without some extraordinary evidence.",0,1345550464,null,0,1345551274,0,c5wg9se,t3_ykmlf,t1_c5wg9se,t1_c5wfkiq,null,1429695831,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

It's not very commonly used as most people understand that the nature and purpose of sex is for pleasure (usually).

The two examples that come straight to mind are:

* a case in which a choirmaster told a girl in the choir that sex would improve her singing voice, eg. deceiving her as it was really for pleasure (*R v Williams*) and, 

* a case in which an angry father got his daughter's boyfriend (or ex, I forget) to perform sexual acts on webcam to embarrass him rather than for sexual pleasure  (*R v Devonald*).

Therefore this section isn't really relevant (as both participants would be aware of the purpose of the act being sexual gratification). Having said which, what is relevant is the fact that you can both withdraw consent at any point and also add conditions to consent, in that she didn't consent to sex without a condom, so there was no consent there (if the allegations are true).",0,1345550973,null,0,1345551226,0,c5wgc00,t3_ykmlf,t1_c5wgc00,t1_c5wfnu1,null,1429695858,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The defence accepts that normally the ticking of a framework list offence box on an EAW would require very little analysis by the court. However they then developed a sophisticated argument that the conduct alleged here would not amount to rape in most European countries. However, what is alleged here is that Mr Assange “deliberately consummated sexual intercourse with her by improperly exploiting that she, due to sleep, was in a helpless state”.

Which is why he was asking if the debate was about that or if it's possible to be in this situation and it *isn't* rape. And someone illustrated that this is indeed possible.

&gt;The fact that one guy said his wife gave him explicit permission to wake her up with his dick does not affect the debate in any way at all

Actually I'd suggest it does. It establishes that many situations are different, and while there can be certain guidelines and no-no's, there are also grey areas. I woke up my then-gf in the same manner, and an hour later had proposed to her - but if we play the polarisation-game, I raped my future bride because I didn't expressly seek her permission first. And in any case, I certainly haven't seen any statements from phillyharper that mean it's time to start jumping up and down.

Righto, because I'd automatically do this in any situation, right?

Which is entirely unsurprising. People really need to look up the old toll road system. Private ""wealth generators"" used to build roads and put up toll gates. Because it was impossible to really build another road due to land ownership they'd have a monopoly. As a result they'd charge huge prices and do the bare minimum of work to the infrastructure.

We nationalised the road network, we tore down the toll booths and repaired the lanes. The cost of doing this was far less than the cost to the economy in tolls and we got a massively superior road network.

The same has happened on the rail network. No investment in the infrastructure with the monopoly used to charge higher prices than would exist otherwise. It'd be much cheaper if the state still owned it but contracted various bits of the services out under the state umbrella.

The truth is the privatisation drive was done backwards. We should never have sold the services. We should have had multiple companies competing to make the best of what we own.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; The problem with 'the shops should be the judge' is the same argument as for 'pubs have the option of going non smoking'. Once one shop opens long hours, all the others will have to. In the same way as no pub would enforce non smoking inside until all the rest did, which was never. This is where the free market fails.

How on earth is the national smoking ban resolving a market failure?

Are you *happy* that pubs have had legislation foisted on them preventing them running their businesses how they (and in many cases, the majority of their customers) want to, in many instances contributing to the demise of those businesses?

&gt; Independent stores could be very profitable and offer very high levels of service, but there is a problem with competing against very large shops/chains. Let's look at Starbucks. Their typical strategy is to crush independent cafes. They do this by opening up so many stores in a given area that they are even cannibalising sales from their own stores. They can afford to take this loss because they have plenty of other shops around the world which are generating profit. Eventually the independent shops have to close, at which point Starbucks can close down it's extra stores and start to ramp prices up. [2] http://www.starbucksunion.org/node/363

Could you provide some figures on how many Starbucks outlets in the UK are loss-leaders? I doubt there are many, if any. Your Starbucks conspiracy theory is a nonsense dreamt up by jilted coffee shop owners who couldn't cut it in the marketplace.

Like supermarkets, we have healthy competition in the coffee market. We have major national chains such as Costa (backup up by the behemoth that is Whitbread) and Caffè Nero, as well as large regional chains, tons of independent coffee shops, and recently every man and his dog selling coffee on the side in their businesses (book shops, art galleries, museums, etc.). 

There are about a dozen coffee shops within five miles of where I live, and not a single one of them is a Starbucks. In fact, I'd rather like a Starbucks in my town. Might get in touch with them.

&gt; I guess the choice is between getting friendly service from a local shop or being served by a drone in a clone town. I'm guessing the latter will win as all Brits care about is ""what's the cheapest?""

Give over. The ""drone"" you speak of is exactly the same person who would be hired by an independent retailer. The only difference is the ownership and management.

I've had some dreadful experiences in independent retailers, and some truly delightful experiences in major national chains. It's the people, not the ownership of the business, that determines the level of service.

&gt; I'm not saying that smaller shops are always better but do you really want the UK to be like Bicester?

Have you ever tried driving into Bicester during the holiday season? It's not uncommon to queue for an hour or two. People fucking love the place.

Why do you think you know better than businesses and consumers?

In a criminal trial, the jury is given quite clear guidance by the trial judge about what constitutes the offence the defendant has been charged with. It's then up to the jury to determine whether the defendant is guilty of that offence.

What cylinderhead is saying is that there is no 'day ticket' concept in English or Swedish law; that is, it is not a defence to a charge or rape to say that you had consensual sex in the 24 hours preceding the offence.

Rape is a very difficult concept legally.

Also, they don't have shareholders to answer to as such. Effectively, the British public are their shareholders (as licence payers). Where the BBC does request copyrighted material to be removed, it only tends to be because of contractual arrangements with third parties - e.g. Terry Nation (or his estate) owns the rights to the Daleks, and can get quite protective of them.

Where no third party is involved, the BBC generally seems happy enough to let fans do what they want, and certainly has no interest in sending lawyers after their own fans.

Customer service in shops/restaurants is miles ahead of the UK.

Leisure activities in general seem to be more accessible and affordable.

Cheap petrol.

People are in general more friendly to strangers, more talkative, none of this silent treatment we do here in England (the south at least, the north's not so bad).

No chavs. Speaks for itself really, they have equivalents which are as bad/worse who knows, but it makes a nice change. 


However, **I prefer the following about the UK:**

The peace of mind you have knowing that you don't have to pay for medical treatment, if something's off you can go the hell and sort it out without having to worry about jack. Just cracked your skull on a skateboard? Call an ambulance, none of this $1000 call out fee bullshit. Honestly this alone is nearly a deal breaker.

Guns...or lack thereof. Honestly its hard to not be at least a bit nervous about people being strapped. The police especially, you really wonder how many of them would bother chasing someone and how many would just shoot them. I much prefer knowing that (almost) no-one has a gun, especially when (if like me) you find yourself in the odd drunken argument/brawl, knowing it almost certainly wont come to someone pulling a piece is reassuring.

Distance - not having to drive 500 miles to somewhere you want to go, everywhere in England is relatively close to itself, having to go to a store to pick something up that takes an hour both ways is a nightmare.


All in all while I grumble about all sorts about England, I'd never permanently consider living in the US again, short term I could probably deal with it.

Oh also they really need to learn to put their bloody tax on in shops BEFORE you get to pay. Even after 4 years it's still a ballache.

My measuring stick for a Torres performance is how often he turns the ball over without creating an offensive threat.  His Wigan performance was decent to good.  He had two great chances to score, one of which was technically a goal (or at least a penalty).  He turned the ball over very little (compared to last season).

I agree. Go ask the leaders of some of our religious organisations if they also agree.

And remember that whilst fortunately these organisations are losing their influence, they still have enough political and social sway to cause a kerfuffle when they want to.

You know how when a friend has a significant other that you don't like?  The SO is not a bad person, and your friend loves being with them, but you just can't stand their personality, or the way they talk, or something like that?  Where you are happy that your friend has found someone, and even begrudgingly acknowledge that this SO has had a positive impact on their life?  That if the SO were to leave, your friend would be crushed?

That's how I feel.  I care about Rose only so far as she affects the Doctor.  I love the Doctor...he's an old and trusted friend.  While I don't like Rose, the Doctor gains friendship, love, trust, and she helps him get over the killing of his species thing.  

I don't have to like her to be happy that she makes him happy, or feel crushed that the Doctor is crushed.  It's my empathy with the Doctor at play, not any particular love of Rose.

It costs a little over £30,000 to house a ""typical"" offender in one of HMS prisons per year. Ignoring the fact it actually costs more to house sex offenders due to the additional measures that have to be put in place, that's a cost of £3,000,000 over the course of 100 years.

It comes down to what you perceive the goal of a prison to be - if it's merely to incarcerate criminals - ""segregate someone from the rest of society"" as t'were, then yes - we're spending a shit-tonne of money doing so. Back to Victorian prisions with a bucket to shit and piss in, and hard labour.

If, however, you think the role of a prison in these decidedly non Victorian times is to actually rehabilitate people, then simply segregating offenders and taking no steps to redress their behaviours isn't the way forward.

The purpose of a prison (imo, obviously) is two fold - yes, it should act as a form of punishment - by isolating the offender from their home comforts and family / friends and by forcing them to comply with a prison ""regime"" this aspect should act as a deter ant to the offender, so they don't want to come back at a later date.

But at least imo, it should also act as a conduit for change - if you've got someone who is facing a long custodial sentence [I'm talking in the magnitude of say three years plus] then doesn't it make sense to focus not only on the crime that brought them into prison but also the thought process behind it?

One thing that I disagree with in your comment:

&gt;Such companies would also be reducing their fares at the expense of other aspects of the service, such as carriage cleanliness and safety.

Companies don't only compete on price, but also on quality of service. In a **hypothetical** world where competition among rail companies were possible and practical, companies that had dirty carriages and bad service would repel customers. (Safety would still need to be regulated, because it is an opaque area to customers.)

2) no direct debits or standing orders

Banks can make money out of somebody who has an account like this via:
* the debit card transaction fee
* paying 0% interest and pocketing whatever they can make with the balance.

true,dvorakoa,null,null,"Great article by Clarkson on his Chelsea love:

Over the years I have argued that football is a stupid game in which 22 overpaid nancy boys with idiotic hair run around a field attempting to kick an inflated sheep’s pancreas into some netting while an audience of several thousand van drivers beat one another over the head with bottles and chairs.

Nor could I understand how someone from Tooting could possibly support, say, Manchester United, a team sponsored by those hateful bastards at AIG and made up of players from Portugal, France, Holland and, in the case of Wayne Rooney, Walt Disney. Where’s the connection? What’s the point?

I have also suggested that it’s preposterous to have football stadiums in the middle of cities. Why should anyone be delayed by match traffic just so a handful of thugs can watch a Brazilian man falling over?

And as for those people who can’t cope if their team loses. Give me strength. If you get all teary-eyed just because someone from Latvia, playing in a town you’ve never been to, for an Arab you’ve never met, against some Italians you hate for no reason, has missed a penalty, how are you going to manage when you are diagnosed with cancer?

I have always hated football, but then one day, out of the blue, my son announced that he had become interested in Chelsea. This was a living nightmare. If he’d said that he’d become interested in smoking, I could have made all sorts of threats. If he’d said he’d become interested in homosexuality, we could have talked. But a football team? I had no answers. I didn’t even have any questions.

However, because he spent so much time watching football on television, I started pausing to watch. And I began to think that actually it’s a very beautiful game when it’s played properly. And that the offside rule, really, is no more complicated than the average power station. And then I started picking up bits of information from the commentators, which meant, for the first time ever, that when conversation with friends turned to football, I could join in, instead of sticking my fingers in my ears and singing sea shanties.

This meant that pretty soon people started asking if perhaps I’d like to go to a game. And that’s why last weekend I was at Stamford Bridge watching Chelsea demolish a team I used to call Manchester City. But that I now know is called Useless Money-Wasting Scum.

This was my first Premier League game and, ooh, it was good. When you’re there, rather than watching on television, you get an overall view, which means you can see how the game works. You notice that Frank Lampard is like a blackbird, always looking around to see where the hawks are. You see that Carvalho runs with his arms up, like a begging puppy, and you work out that Michael Essien always seems to be able to find a piece of the pitch that the Useless Scum either hadn’t noticed or were frightened of.

The other advantage of being there is that on television the microphones are positioned so you can’t hear the chants. I’d heard, of course, about this mass spontaneity over the years, usually when a team is playing Liverpool. “Sign on. Sign on. With a pen in your hand. Cos you’ll ne . . . ver get a job.” Or: “The wheels on your house go round and round. Round and round. Round and round.”

There are others too. Plymouth Argyll refer to any team they play as northern bastards. Then you have the Charlton fans who travelled down the M4 to Reading recently and, having failed to think of any suitable abuse, came up with: “What’s it like to live in Wales?”

The Chelsea fans topped all this last Sunday with a nonstop song, the lyrics of which were: “F*** off, Robinho. F*** off, Robinho. F*** off, Robinho.” I joined in wholeheartedly, even though I wasn’t entirely sure who Mr Robinho was and why I wanted him to eff off so much.

No matter. It was all so brilliantly working class. Or it would have been, had I not been seated in a private box just outside the no-jeans-allowed Armani Lounge, where I’d feasted on smoked salmon and quaffed bucks fizz before kickoff.

But I got a reminder of footballing’s outside-khazi and jumpers-for-goalposts roots when Chelsea scored. I turned and smiled a patronising smile at the man sitting behind me, the former Independent editor and all-round crap driver Simon Kelner. It turned out he was a big fan of the Scum and, honestly, I thought he was going to kick my head off.

I wouldn’t have blamed him. I used to be surprised that football fans fought one another. Now, though, having experienced the white heat of pride and tribalism first hand, I’m surprised they don’t any more.

After the game I was taken to the Chelsea dressing room so that I could admire all the players’ penises – many were very enormous indeed. I talked to Roman Abramovich, who was charming, and Lampard, who, having just run around for 90 minutes, still found the energy to get the entire team to sign my boy’s Chelsea shirt. I don’t do that for kids who come to the Top Gear studio and I’m supposed to be the public-school-educated toff.

So there we are, then. I am now a football fan. I know this because in one afternoon I learnt I’m not a football fan at all. I’m a fan of Chelsea. Chelsea are the only team that can play. Chelsea players have by far the most impressive reproductive organs. Stamford Bridge is my church. The men who play there are my Gods.

In short, I have a team, and that’s what’s always been missing. Because I was born in Doncaster.",0,1345562402,null,0,false,0,c5wikbf,t3_ykz0q,t1_c5wikbf,t3_ykz0q,null,1429696980,23,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,23

I can see why it looks attractive in theory, you retain public control and yet keep the element of competition. In practice however it seems to lead to a lot of back handers and secret dealings and you still end up with monolithic private companies winning all the contracts and providing a shoddy service for far-too-much money..

Edit: I'm not being funny with you, but I don't really see the point in discussing whether or not Reddit is left leaning any more. The user base has expanded dramatically so a diversification of views is to be expected.

&gt;###Alert leads to Bristol road closures
&gt;
&gt;Motorists are being asked to avoid part of Bristol city centre after the Cabot Circus shopping centre was closed due to a security alert.
&gt;
&gt;Officers were called at 14:00 BST to reports of a suspicious package which had been left outside a shop.
&gt;
&gt;The Explosives Ordinance Disposal Unit has been called as a precaution and is travelling to the shopping centre.
&gt;
&gt;Police say a 100m cordon has been put in place and there is traffic congestion in surrounding roads.
&gt;
&gt;Temple Way and the slip roads into Old Market, Bond Street, Lower Castle Street, Penn Street and Horsefair have been closed.
&gt;
&gt;A city council spokeswoman said up to a mile-wide diversion had been put in place and the closure was affecting pedestrians as well as motorists

Point in case? Have a look through some of my comments in this discussion thus far - hopefully they're pretty well-balanced, and make a point to express the need for rehabilitation, as well as arguing against the notion of ""eye for an eye"" punishments, or the death penalty.

With that in mind, let me say that if anyone ever raped a kid of mine, I'd tear the cunt apart limb from limb.

If the US wanted to extradite him, they could have done so while he was here in Britain, but they didn't! Assange and his legal team is manipulating the press and people's (perhaps understandable) suspicion of the US justice system. But ultimately this IS about a rape case in Sweden and not the US/cable leaks issue, which is a distraction that is working well to prevent him answering charges in a well regarded European nation's judicial system. I personally support what wikileaks does, I think whistleblowing is important; but I don't support Assange who appears to be playing with the system and public sentiment over a personal legal matter. 

Also, Ecuador has been foolish getting involved in this. As well as annoying other nations, they will be a target for crackpots making spurious asylum requests. I think the UK should consider closing Equador's embassy and expelling Equador's ambassador *once this is over however it ends (but not before)* to send a clear message that the U.K. cannot have foreign nation's interfering in our legal system like this.

A third person over the shoulder perspective camera,  (similar to resident evil 4) with tomb raider style elements, and puzzle elements, (Deus Ex style hacking? Puzzle Quest Gem Matching?).  If anyone has read the Doctor Who, graphic novel ""The Forgotten"", it would make an excellent premise for the game (or at least something similar).  You would play through the game as each of the Doctors regenerations, starting at one doing a challenge relevant to what that Doctor experienced in the show.  Then move on to two, three, and so forth.  This would make for a long game with plenty of content.

You could also add a challenge mode to defeat levels as your favorite doctor, maybe even have an experience system as you progress with each of the Doctors having advantages/disadvantages to different enemies/puzzles based on their experiences.",0,1345571172,null,0,false,0,c5wl0km,t3_ykoig,t1_c5wl0km,t3_ykoig,null,1429698138,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

true,not-really,null,null,"Claiming Craig Murray is deliberately leaking information to prejudice legal proceedings is far fetched indeed. Again this requires evidence of equal weight.

You didn't answer the question. I guess the answer is no, you haven't looked closely at the evidence, yet you hold very strong opinions:

&gt; She did not consent to the sex in the morning, that's clear.

I suggest if you don't like third hand conjecture and scandalisation ('bunny boiler', 'high tech terrorist', 'smelly', 'CIA linked' ('they' have said that about Assange as well), 'coward', 'criminal', 'rapist', 'victim') then I suggest you ignore them and go to the source. In one source you will see a [lengthy interview by the police of Assange in Sweden](http://rixstep.com/1/20110201,00.shtml). Now doesn't that contradict the narrative spun about Assange wanting to evade questioning? At that time they had the evidence and didn't choose to arrest Assange; too bad for them I say. 

Elsewhere in the evidence we can read the following:

&gt; [And as I understood it, that was why she was going to go with her to the police to get advice about how to force uh, Julian to uh, test himself.](http://rixstep.com/1/20110201,00.shtml)

&gt; [...]

&gt; [Not after the complaint but that Friday, uh, when the girls actually go to the police (inaudible) I think it was a Friday. Before that Anna rings me frequently. Uh, and above all that we want him to test himself so then we won't file a complaint she says. OK I say, I'll ring Julian and tell him that. And so I do. And so I ring Anna and Anna rings me.](http://rixstep.com/1/20110201,00.shtml)

The case is far from being clear lack of consent which you have claimed. Poor bedroom manner or even a misunderstanding seems equally legitimate a claim. Rape seems an outrageous claim looking at the evidence available.

The simple fact is that there is a malicious prosecution happening in the US and Ecuador has given Assange asylum for that matter. The allegations in Sweden can be seen as a separate legal issue. Once in the custody of Swedish officials it is impossible to request asylum from behind bars. There is hardly any doubt that the US will at least throw an extradition request for this 'high tech terrorist' at Sweden which means he will be once again bled dry and fighting a lengthy legal battle, if not exported straight away.

Things have gotten so muddy that there are only two people who can clarify things. There are claims by [Christine Assange](http://www.codru.eu/ro/news/1-latest-news/924-the-truth-about-julian-assange-and-wikileaks) that one of the women refused to sign her witness statement. The woman could release by 'their lawyer' a statement of some kind to support their desire for prosecution. Instead Claes Borgstrom has stated publicly that it doesn't matter whether they think they were raped or not, because ""they are not lawyers.""

true,BritMicroserf,null,null,"By the time the death penalty was revoked, back in 1965, it had already been conclusively proven that at least two people who were completely innocent of the crimes for which they were accused, had been convicted by mistake, and ultimately killed. There have also been a fair few cases since then of people convicted of various crimes, sentenced to life in prison, only to be found innocent 20+ years later. With those kind of sentencing tariffs, it's likely, had the death penalty still existed, they'd have been killed for those crimes.

Had the death penalty not been removed from the statue books back in the mid 1960s, one can only wonder how many people would have had an appointment with Pierrepoint, who were innocent of the crimes levied against them.

true,cylinderhead,null,null,"&gt;Claiming Craig Murray is deliberately leaking information to prejudice legal proceedings is far fetched indeed. Again this requires evidence of equal weight.

Equal weight to what? It's a fact he has leaked names as often and as widely as he's able. What other reason can there be other than to prejudice the proceedings? It's undeniably a result of his actions, and he undeniably knew that would be the result. If the case was being tried in England, Craig Murray would be in police custody.

&gt;doesn't that contradict the narrative spun about Assange wanting to evade questioning?

no, it does not. Assange fled when it became clear that he was going to be charged with sex offences. He fled from a country which is legally prohibited from extraditing him, to a country (it's us!) which has a disproportionate extradition agreement with the United States.

&gt;The simple fact is that there is a malicious prosecution happening in the US and Ecuador has given Assange asylum for that matter.

I don't require ""evidence of equal weight"" but the US have no grounds to request his extradition from Sweden, so where are the reliable, non tin foil hatted reports of this malicious prosecution? I don't doubt the US would love to get their hands on him, as they did with Bradley Manning, who is the real (unraped / sexually assaulted) victim here. But Assange is not a US citizen.

&gt;Things have gotten so muddy that there are only two people who can clarify things.

Well no, there are at least three people and several legal teams who can clarify things, in a court of law, in Sweden, the country frequently held up as the paragon of Western democracy.

I didn't watch the channel this morning, so I can't say that I saw a trailer recently. But as of yesterday morning the trailer still said ""Coming this Fall.""

&gt;Outside of this one trailer airing, BBC America have not announced a date anywhere else. Only stating that: “We’ll be announcing the broadcast date of this, the first episode of Season 7 later this week.”

So until BBCA actually comes out and makes an *official announcement*, I think it would be silly to get our hopes up. Don't get me wrong, I seriously cannot wait for this to air!

Those who like memes aren't generally the type to read self-posts -- the ""fly-by"" upvoters -- and probably won't see or comment in this thread.  IMO, just because these people are less active doesn't mean their opinion is worth less.  I haven't seen a good argument explaining why these ""fly-by"" people's opinions are not relevant.

For an analogy, I picture the anti-meme crowd as a bunch of ""old-farts"" who want to ban MTV because they don't like watching MTV.  To which I say, ""if you don't like it, don't watch it.  I'm so, so sorry it requires another flick of the remote control to flip past the channel.""  If 90% of the channels were MTV, the old-farts might have a point.  But really a much smaller percentage of the channels are MTV.

Solitary confinement wouldn't work, at least not in the context of attempting to rehabilitate someone for eventual re-ingratiation back into society. Whilst a prison environment is no substitute for the ""real world"" outside, it's a good approximation, not least of all in terms of explaining empathy to offenders (something a number of offenders fail to comprehend initially.).

As for their dietary concerns - prision authorities have an obligation (like it or not) to ensure minimum standards are met, to address the physical and mental needs of inmates. Serving one meal a day doesn't fall under that remit, for a whole raft of reasons.

Psychological tests five days a week? That wouldn't get anyone anywhere, as it's too frequent. Delivering the appropriate rehabilitation programme depends on balancing a whole plethora of different factors, not least of all the (often times glacial) change in an offenders thought process.

&gt;One thing I can't understand is why prisoners with violent convictions are allowed access to gyms and 3 meals a day. They should be physically weakened as part of their punishment.

Access to gyms is often times controlled, for all to obvious reasons. As for the notion that inmates should be ""physically weakened"" - as referenced above, prison authorities have a mandate of responsibility when it comes to offenders - feeding them a diet that's designed to weaken them doesn't fall under that category, regardless how heinous their crimes were.",0,1345576636,null,0,false,0,c5wmomk,t3_ykskq,t1_c5wmomk,t1_c5wmb49,null,1429698915,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I also think this suggests Huddlestone is part of AVB's plans, or at least being considered; I am certain we could sell Huddlestone now if he wasn't.  A six-month loan to another BPL team would be a great chance for him to prove himself.

The perpetrators of such crimes don't care about jail time. They have serious mental problems and rehabilitation will not work. Rehabilitation is for people who've strayed, not for people who have no empathy or conscience. Punishment won't solve anything but we can surely learn from them.

I went to gamescom and near unlimited public transport within cologne was offered free with the tickets, meaning I could leave my hotel, get on a tram (which ran like clockwork) to the show, into the city centre, and back, as much as I wanted. The only restriction was that I couldn't travel first class.

There were frequent and varied services, making travelling about the city effortless.

This had the knock on effect (bearing in mind over 100,000 people descended on cologne for the expo) of the city being heaving with people after the doors closed, and the economy was no doubt boosted, because my friends and I saw restaurants and shops full of people who had been to gamescom.

Free public transport boosting the economy...what a novel concept.

Not only that, on the day our tickets expired, we were able to get unlimited day travel (so we could spend our final day in town and then go to the airport) for 11 euros 90. This was for two of us, but was valid for up to five people.

FIVE PEOPLE for E11-90.

true,Lakey91,null,null,"Hmm... I sometimes think it's best to see whether we can improve the current system before we decide we need a new one.

In the current system, the Government own the track, the Companies provide the service and they rent the stock (rail cars) from another company. The Rail Companies make a slim profit; some of the ticket price and all of the fare increases (fare increases are essentially a tax) go to the Government, who are supposed to maintain and improve the track. Most of the rest goes toward renting the stock which is extortionately expensive. If the rail company is lucky they have some money left over to take as profit.

The mistake of the Government wasn't the partial privatisation as a whole, but the selling off of the rail carriages. Unlike the rail companies that are bound by franchise contracts, the carriage suppliers can charge whatever they like, and it's often a lot.

The solution, therefore, is not complete nationalisation, but the purchasing by the Government of new stock. If they own the stock, then rather than subsidising the rail, they could probably make a tidy profit. Furthermore, given that they would rent the stock at cheaper prices than at current, rail fares could come down.

Why isn't this likely? Because Governments last 5 years. If the Government buy new carriages they'll have to upgrade the track. This will be a huge cost that won't see profit for years. We'll see the debt go up (and fares will rise to pay for the improved service) and it'll be our children to reap the benefits. You can't vote retrospectively so a future Government will take the credit, not the current one.

Its a cave and probably impressive as it's several hundred years older than your country but don't be tricked into thinking its the best pub in Nottingham; the beer is so far from being the best it's not worth hanging out there for too long in my opinion. Going to people ""hey wanna drink in a cave"" seems to attract a lot of American tourists with bum bags (""fanny packs"" to your american tongue).

The old salutation is nearby but that one depends on your scene. If you like rock/metal you'll love it. If, on the other hand, you're more of a ""clean"" kind of guy you'll probably want to leave in 5 minutes.

The square is nice but the pubs are almost all shit. The Dragon and the Bell Inn are nice but nothing special and there are *two*, Wetherspoons nearby. If you never eat or drink in a wetherspoons when you're in the UK you are doing it right. In fact, if anyone recommends a pub to you  always ask ""is it a 'spoons or a lloyds"" if the answer is yes ask yourself why you're going on holiday, is it to eat shit Burgers and drink cheap booze in a pub filled with no atmosphere or is it to experience the good parts of Britain?

Not too far from the train station is the [vat and fiddle](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Vat+and+fiddle&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=52.945923,-1.146612&amp;sspn=0.010628,0.019205&amp;gl=uk&amp;hq=Vat+and+fiddle&amp;t=m&amp;z=16). Which runs brewery tours of Castle Rock beer which is pretty nice if you like English Ale. This is a bit old man-esque though, you aren't going to meet any young ""happening"" people. For that I'd recommend the lace market. You won't find great beer or pubs older than your country here but you won't find too many of the local chavs either, so it's worth going to if you want to stay up late and aren't planning on heading to a club.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"Well, my half-time thoughts are that we're living a charmed life. We've had one shot on target and one goal. Before then, Blackpool were murdering us in midfield and they resumed doing that after conceding. We've had two absolutely top drawer saves from Kenny, getting down low when the balls seemed to be destined for the corner, and two penalty appeals - one a handball, the other a foul - from Blackpool turned down.

Austin and Norris have hardly gotten a foot on the ball - and they hoof it when they do. Having said that, we are attacking quickly when we can, rather than holding onto it, but Becchio and Varney keep getting caught offside.

Right now, as Eddie Gray has pointed out on Yorkshire Radio, the best part about going into half time in the lead is that we look like we can get more out of our players, while Blackpool are performing well in every department except finishing, so there's more room for their performance to drop as they grow disheartened about being unable to score, than there is for it to get even better. However, if they score and smell blood then we're going to be in trouble.
