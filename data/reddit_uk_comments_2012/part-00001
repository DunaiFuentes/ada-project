Henderson and Adam were bypassing him completely when trying to set up moves. I understand the role of anchoring the midfield, but he didn't really put in that many tackles either. Maybe I've just become accustomed to relying on Lucas to do it all without noticing.

I would much prefer to see Henderson sitting deeper and moving the ball about like Lucas has for the last 18 months. If we had been playing a more attacking player than Spearing in front of Adam and Hendo instead of behind then I really think we would have been more threatening against City tonight.

What I got out of the game is that I disagreed with Kenny's lineup, I'd rather have seen Stevie start and go off at half then come on late. Also not starting Maxi was an issue, and Bellers. Although I am assuming Kenny had his reasons.

I also got that Downing can't score for shit and we are lacking the proper service for Carroll. When SG came on he was being closed down fast and none of the other players on the team seem capable of putting an accurate ball into the box unless they are at the baseline and there are 5 defenders in the area with Andy.",0,1325652809,null,0,true,0,c3dqn02,t3_o1kwh,t1_c3dqn02,t1_c3dn9a3,null,1428120269,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

He kept quiet for a day, but then suggested to the others that they need to take themselves into the police station and admit it. The next day his kitten was dead. 

For years he struggled with his guilt, and began to do charity work. Over the years he set up soup kitchens and eventually flew to africa to help starving orphans.

Meanwhile his efforts to educate people on the dangers of racism resulted in the halving of race-on-race violence in London.

Just this year he cured cancer.

Or maybe not. Maybe all five of them attacked Stephen, as witness testimony indicates. Maybe all five of them surrounded him, and while they were all attacking him, one of them knifed him. Maybe all five then lied about what happened and actively covered up the events.

Maybe they are all guilty and none of them had honourable or justifiable reasons to LIE.

&gt;It is easy to say do the right thing but probably a bit harder when it's going to turn your life upside down and put your family in danger.

Your opinion is just that - it has no affect on the law or the outcome of this case. They were all complicit. 5 men were seen ATTACKING Stephen Lawrence. They all stopped him getting away. If it was one man with a knife attacking Lawrence then he might have got away. They are ALL COMPLICIT.

To be fair, they kept many rural lines open back in the 80s. Take them out of service now and the North of England and South Wales would lose thousands of seats in rail capacity.

I think the regulations for improving access to trains for disabled people that are coming in in 2020 will finally kill them off.

or some other variation that reintroduces those 3 players isn't a big change imo, it's not like we're clamouring for 3 new players of starting XI quality merely the return of 3 players who are effectively locked in choices on the teamsheet when fit and available.

As for those desperate for a new striker I'd question whether a rash buy now for an over the odds price is the right decision. While we picked up Luis Suarez for a steal last January so far we have been linked with Darren Bent and Lukas Podolski.

I'm not a fan of Bent so I will leave discussion of him to other more neutral parties.

Podolski, I thoroughly enjoy watching when Germany play but if you look at his club statistics on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lukas_Podolski#Club_career) including an impressive 14 goals in 16 appearances for Köln this season, he averages 0.321 goals a game in the Bundesliga(I disregarded his most impressive full season 04-05 as this was achieved in the 2.

Bearing in mind that there are various privileges afforded to religious groups already, I tend not to agree. Britain might appear secular, as well as mainly irreligious, but that does not mean it actually *is* a secular country. You may think that a moot point, but obviously there are many of us who do not. Of course the NSS being one of the few dedicated secular bodies in the UK means they are going to spice up the language a little, but really their words are fairly accurate.

Various problems currently in the UK:

* We have a state endorsed religion.
* We have clergymen who have a say over our laws by the simple expedient of their following *one* particular faith - this means that they can and do veto or object to certain issues that come into conflict with their faith when the majority of the general public do not adhere to that religion: 26 exclusively *male* Bishops in the House of Lords.
* We have ~1/3 of state funded schools having a particular religious ethos meaning that children are effectively taught a religion.
* The number of faith schools is set to rise as successive governments are keen on having faith run schools.
* Our politicians and government continually tells us that religion and faith is important while religious observance has been in decline for decades and is still falling. [Now ~75% non-religious/non-practicing in the UK.](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://ir2.flife.de/data/natcen-social-research/igb_html/pdf/chapters/BSA28_12Religion.pdf&amp;pli=1)
* Religious groups continually press for exemption from equality laws and legislation.
* The law is still in place that requires all state schools to make children attend daily collective worship of primarily Christian nature. It was only in 2006 that parents got the right to remove their child from such worship and that children over 16 could excuse themselves. *added - thanks Makio_*

That's to start with. [It was only in recent months that the law was changed so that the ruling monarch doesn't have to be Anglican.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15492607) That's a huge issue - we were forcing someone to *be* a particular religion!

I realise that many people think that the NSS etc. are being doom and gloom about nothing and apparently trying to scaremonger, but have a look at various issues from only the last year:

In Parliament for example Nadine Dorries called for various things and [her ""abstinence"" amendment](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/may/04/nadine-dorries-teenage-girls) is getting a second reading this month! Need I add that at the time of her reading she also implied that [""If girls know how to say no then maybe we wouldn't see so much sexual abuse in children""](http://nightmaresandboners.com/2011/05/16/nadine-dorries-thinks-i-was-asking-for-it/)? I realise that her personal opinions don't speak for an entire group, but that should given an indication as to how little she understands such issues and where she's coming from.

The lobbying by religious groups is not something to brush off: various Christian groups are continually picking away at certain aspects of law as they try to guide policy to reflect their beliefs and wishes. The [""independent counselling""](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14817816) for women thinking of having an abortion is a case in point. If you know anything of the subject then you'll have seen the lies and half truths from the Christian right that continue to be repeated even though they were defeated. 

Recently two members of the Lords spoke of their [displeasure at how their plans for amendments to sex education were misrepresented by some pressure groups](http://www.religiousintelligence.org/churchnewspaper/news/%E2%80%98cruel%E2%80%99-campaign-leads-to-apology/). We know from the US how very well abstinence-only sex education works, but there are many vocal religious people who wish [for UK sex ed. to be as minimal as possible.](http://www.christian.org.uk/news/sex-ed-inspections-could-be-forced-on-primary-schools/)

Even something as simple as trying to ensure there's a [law in place that stop faith schools from sacking a teacher for not being the correct religion, was recently dismissed.](http://www.secularism.org.uk/teacher-discrimination-challenge.html) Those amendments also included ensuring that faith schools were not able to dismiss staff due to their sexual orientation. To paraphrase the Bishop of Oxford: ""Oh I can't see a faith school ever doing that - what a terrible thing it would be!"" He then voted against the amendments.

On the subject of discrimination based on sexual orientation, there are [currently four cases before the European Court of Human Rights concerning the actions taken by Christian people](http://www.secularism.org.uk/131047.html). All four cases lost in the UK with the ruling that various supposed aspects of religious faith doesn't come before certain other issues: Uniform policy and someone's right to be treated equally due to their sexual orientation.

 To give you an idea of how the religious right represent these cases, check out the language and remember that all of these cases lost in court and on appeal:

* [Gary McFarlane](http://www.christianconcern.com/cases/gary-mcfarlane) - sacked for refusing to give relationship counselling to homosexuals.

The religious right have been very vocal in recent years trying to give the public the impression that 'religion is under attack' when in reality some religious people are being held to account for contravening various aspects of law. The issues mainly surround 'sex' issues: equality for any and all sexual orientations; sex education; abortion etc. Unfortunately various groups have learnt from and are being funded by similar groups from the US. It would not be prudent to assume that just because the UK appears secular, that it actually is or will remain so. 

Of course I don't expect anyone to be as interested in the topic as I, nor see it as being so important. The links above are to give an indication as to how much people are doing with regards to this issue, mainly to dispel the sentiment behind:

&gt; Oh come off it.

Carroll was ok but he just needs a bit more game time and somebody next to him.

Conclusions for me are that we need a DM and we need a striker in this window. Probably won't happen and that also isn't ok - but for a shot at the top 2 next year we need to deepen the squad.

I also think Kuyt is playing his last games for the club which is a shame, but he simple hasn't been the same player this season.

No-one is calling for buildings to be demolished or for the religion to be eradicated. It doesn't matter that it *used* to be the religion of the nation - it no longer is. Far more people take an interest in football of a weekend than attend a CoE church.

&gt; Also everyone in the CofE is terminally lovely.

So? A jest I imagine, but is the case for keeping the CoE as the state endorsed religion so weak that ""It's nice and our heritage"" is the only reason for keeping it?

&gt; a nice alternative to 100% state education.

A nice alternative *if* there is even the option. I'm going to start work on mapping all the locations of faith schools to see how many parents have a reasonable alternative to the local faith (usually primary) school. I would guess that, particularly in smaller towns and villages, they don't. That's not fair - only one school that you can get your child to and it is somewhere they'll be taught a religion. How many nominally Christian parents who don't really mind their child being given a 'Christian education' would be happy with their child being taught in a 'Muslim' or 'Hindu school'? I would posit very few, but that's no different to non-religious parents having no option but to put their child in a Christian run school.

&gt; Religious schools on average get MUCH higher grades than state comprehensives, despite taking kids from all backgrounds.

There's a reason for that and it's not just a better quality of teacher or curriculum, even if it is at all, and the ""kids from all backgrounds"" isn't actually true so far as it goes. [Faith schools can select who they take in](http://www.secularism.org.uk/uploads/faith-school-admissions-campaign-briefing.pdf), while 'state' schools generally have to take anyone, and when you've got the option of wheedling out the 'bad eggs' then you're off to a better start already. That's before you consider the divisive nature of a school run on a particular faith:

You might argue that the ones who previously crashed here weren't a part of the Time War, but there's no way to know that. Or to know who they are.

They have been more than placed at the scene - but proved to be in close proximity at time of the stabbing (fibres, blood spot). The lesser charge is completely fair and reflects the evidence. (it's worth remembering there is a lot of other evidence that while circumstantial, only adds to the case)

The lack of a murder conviction is to do with specific evidence relating to a specific charge and not their ""guilt"". That's why I find the article so misleading - it skips past the ACTUAL evidence and assumes that a lack of murder charge may equate to innocence somehow.

I personally think one unfortunate (maybe not the right word?!) thing is that it was probably only 1 of the 5 who committed actual murder - but it's up to the others to clear themselves. By muddying the waters they have made sure that nobody is charged for the more serious crime, but damned themselves to being part of the provable joint enterprise - which is exactly what it was. This is NOT an injustice - this is the way the law works in the face of provable evidence Vs people not volunteering information.

Although I can see us beating Arsenal in a bidding war, Poldoski has committed himself to Koln until the summer. Stranger things have happened I know, but can't see him making the move in Jan.

Realistic targets? 

DMs - Moussa Sissoko 15-20 million - Yaya Toure-like, moves between the thirds when asked, strong in the tackle and comfortable in any central midfield position. 

Éver Banega - 10-15 million - Unfairly left out of the World Cup squad by Maradona. Attainable target due to Valencia's financial situation. Time is on his side at 23, however has not been at his best in the past year.

Wingers - Scott Sinclair - 3-8 million - One of Swansea's stand out performers, good on the ball, two footed and has been giving Danny Graham a decent supply of crosses this season. Kenny is known to be a fan.

Junior Hoilett - 5 -10 million - One of the few from Blackburn to enhance their reputation this season. The Canadian is deceptively strong, can beat a man and is economical with the ball. Will almost certainly be available in the summer, if not January.

Strikers - Nilmar - 20 million - The Brazilian initially flopped at Lyon but has impressed since arriving from Internacional. On the bad side of 26 which could rule him out due to FSGs policies. 

Llorente - 20-25 million - Tall, strong, good finisher and better on the ball than AC. Known to be a long time target since the Benitez days, this boat might have sailed but would be interested to see him in the PL.

* The Arcateenian and their world (Torchwood original alien). The description of their planet and culture sounds badass.

* Appearance of some other aliens from Torchwood or the Sarah Janes Adventures. I don't understand why they don't recycle them more when they end up being pretty cool (The Trickster and The Three Families would be cool as hell).

I think we'll see:

* River Song and the Doctor together at their last trip (from the timeline of the Doctor) to Darillium to see the Singing Towers, where he gives her the upgraded sonic screwdriver.

* Trenzalore and the Fall of the eleventh, where the Silence will be defeated for good.

What you have to keep in mind is that the episodes have different writers and directors so the tone shifts quite often.

Most of series one is going to fall into the campy lighthearted mood. If you really can't stand any sort of campiness, here's a list of what I consider skipable episodes.

Series 1:
Aliens of London
World War 3
Boom Town

Series 2:
The Idiot's Lantern
Fear Her
Love &amp; Monsters

All the campy Episodes in series 3&amp;4 have important plot points. At the 2010 semi-sorta reboot, instead of campy, groan worthy episodes, you just get boring ones. If you REALLY want to skip the first 4 series, you should at least watch Silence of the Library and Forest of the Dead from Series 4.

Bribery, corruption and self-interest are so deeply engrained in politics that nothing short of blowing up the houses of parliament and starting again with a completely new system will have any real effect (no that's not a serious threat in case anyone is thinking of sending the anti-terrorist police around to arrest me).  And even then I'm sure the rich and powerful would find some way to subvert the new system for their own interests.

So while we're tackling lobbying we should also look closely at the way political parties are funded by donations.  Companies and interest groups give money to politicians because they're expecting something in return.  It's as simple and obvious as that.  But hey, if we make them declare amounts over a certain value then it'll all be OK.

Then we have the members' record of interest which effectively records the bribes and ""incidental benefits"" that politicians receive once they've been elected.  As long as everything is declared openly then somehow it's all perfectly acceptable.  

Thankfully we live in a so-called ""democracy"" and can elect new politicians to replace the old ones every few years.  But far too many top politicians walk straight out of office into a cushy consultancy job or a position on the board of a company that benefitted greatly from some policy or other that was implemented by the politician during their term of office.  We all know it happens, but can we do anything to stop it?

I'm not sure that double jeopardy means what you think it does.

Firstly, the Double Jeopardy principle of not retrying suspects for a crime for which they already stood trial [was removed from English &amp; Welsh law in 2005](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4406129.stm).

Secondly, even if the Double Jeopardy law was still in effect, it would have no bearing on the public, just on the suspects. I'm not sure, but I think possibly you mean Double Jeopardy would prevent anyone else being remanded on suspicion of the murder, which wasn't the case even before 2005: all Double Jeopardy meant was that if a person was tried of something, *that same person* could not be tried for the same offence. Other people could be, and indeed, often were (for example in cases where a criminal, having been sent down, proceeded to rat on his former mates).

from the wikipedia page on BIOS:

""Some BIOSes contain a ""SLIC"" (software licensing description table), a digital signature placed inside the BIOS by the manufacturer, for example Dell. This SLIC is inserted in the ACPI table and contains no active code. Computer manufacturers that distribute OEM versions of Microsoft Windows and Microsoft application software can use the SLIC to authenticate licensing to the OEM Windows Installation disk and/or system recovery disc containing Windows software. Systems having a SLIC can be preactivated with an OEM product key, and they verify an XML formatted OEM certificate against the SLIC in the BIOS as a means of self-activating (see System Locked Preinstallation). If a user performs a fresh install of Windows, they will need to have possession of both the OEM key and the digital certificate for their SLIC in order to bypass activation; in practice this is extremely unlikely and hence the only real way this can be achieved is if the user performs a restore using a pre-customised image provided by the OEM.""",0,1325703041,null,0,false,0,c3dwa6x,t3_o2edd,t1_c3dwa6x,t1_c3dv7p4,null,1428123006,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Obviously Amy &amp; Rory are not the Doctor's constant companions, because they've taken breaks and resumed a normal Earth-bound life at times when he's gone away. I think they become a bigger part of the show because of this, outside of companion-status.

From a young age, Amy had been awed by the doctor, and then forced to forgo her fantasy and obsession with him through the reality that he didn't return while she waited. She's been waiting her whole life, as has been noted in many episodes this season. I think, as a result, Amy &amp; Rory as adults are more capable to continue their normal lives than past companions who have been completely shell shocked and had their lives completely altered by the Doctor's presence.

For 9 and 10, The Doctor acts like a sophisticated heartthrob leading man, and the companions are these mates who latch onto him. With 11, as badass as he can be sometimes, his characterization is mostly that of a little boy, who giggles at the smallest marvels and gets infatuated with children's toys. As such, Amy and Rory's roles often seem parental to him. The way they greet him and hug him are in a manner that's more family than romantic compared to Rose and Martha or Jack, and they scold him when he misbehaves in a manner that's more mentor-like than Donna did. When The Doctor defeats his enemies and they congratulate him, it always looks like Amy is smiling and about to pinch his cheeks and go, ""Yay, you did it! Good boy!"" and Rory stands there nodding approvingly with a ""Nice job. Proud of you.""

Not to mention Moffat making that family feel even more overt when he made Amy and Rory his in-laws.

Students don't go out on the weekends in UK as that's when all the locals are out and there are no student deals on making it a bit more expensive. The weekends do give you a chance to check out the city during the day though, and it's quite worth it.

Matt, on the other hand, is the perfect ""Madman with a blue box,"" with just the right amount of eccentricity.

He screws up more often because of his quirks, but when everything depends on him alone, he can be as strong as ever, trust me.

Also, he's more of a trickster and cunning planner, rather than Tenth who is more a man of action, and many a problem will be solved by Eleventh's convoluted plans in the sixth season, which I found simply delightful.

&gt; Here’s how I understand the over-diagnosis issue, in terms of an extreme example: suppose that there’s a form of cancer that kills people 7 years after it starts, and that there is in fact nothing you can do about it.

Yet treatment in country B is no worse than in country A.

Yes, you can construct an ""extreme example"" that would explain the gap if it were true, but there's no evidence presented that anything like that example holds in the real world.

I do find Amy cute, but am very put off by her.  I can't justify liking a character just because she is cute.  And I get the feeling that the writers think it's ok to not develop her that much just because people will automatically like her because she is cute and in skimpy clothes.  I suppose it's hard to develop her character when they were trying to keep her backstory a secret for the ""most of her life was taken by the crack"" reveal.

I like Rory, but he seems way too insecure and whipped for me to cheer for.  I can see that he is starting to become stronger, and I like seeing that change, but I feel like making him wait 2000 years (something that should make him seem like a badass) was rushed so quickly that it didn't seem that important.  They really could have highlighted his struggle and shown the strength it took him to wait 2000 years, but instead we saw him again 5 minutes later.  It was a disappointing reveal and ruined what could have been a badass moment.  I mean, he wins badass of the season just giving his life to save the Doctor from the Silurian.  Again, another moment where I felt let down by the Doctor.  Who clearly would have died if it weren't for an average human being more heroic and and aware of what was going on than him.

I am very intrigued by River from the two stories I have seen her in.  But her condescending tone and nagging of the Doctor bugs me.  I definitely want to learn more about her and can guess where things will go based on what I believe is foreshadowing dialogue, but I hope she isn't always the cocky, know-it-all, somewhat-annoying character she sometimes seems like.

I'm glad to hear there will be some quirky and convoluted plans in the sixth season.  I didn't many of any plans in the 5th season.  Which I suppose I am being harsh about, 9 and 10 didn't always have plans... but something about their actions during moments of danger seemed more heroic and intelligent than 11.

Firstly, it sounds like you become particularly attached to an actor, rather than the Doctor. I honestly believe that is not the way to watch Doctor Who - there have been eleven different Doctors now, and while we all have our favourites, they do all play the same character.

As such, your criticisms seems to be based on ""it's not x so it's bad"". And I don't think that's fair, the new team have done sterling work in creating the new series.

&gt;It felt so much more childish (in it's humor) than anything I had seen in the series so far

There's childish and there's having humour that appeals to children. I'm making this distinction because, quite frankly, the last couple of Doctors had farting aliens.

&gt;It's so crisp and clean.

The TARDIS with Nine and Ten was fresh from the Time War (and a limited budget), it was battered and worn out. Eleven's TARDIS is renewed, regenerated and is *freakin' awesome.* It's not broody and emo and generally distressed - she's full of life and fun and adventure.

&gt;She saved the Star Whale, she reminded Bracewell 

That isn't intelligence, that's *emotion.* That actually becomes a theme later, that the Doctor is getting old, and needs his Companions to show him how wonderful everything in the universe is.

&gt;because 80% of the time, he doesn't really have a plan or any idea what to do. 

You can hardly say Nine or Ten knew what to do a lot of the time - heck, Ten blew up Pompeii because he didn't have a plan and got stuck at the end. Eleven's plans usually come together right at the end, it's seems that he collects all information, plans along the way and the BAM, solves it all.

&gt;I can't feel compassion for a companion who throws herself at the Doctor the night before her wedding

But that's part of Amy's character development - she's genuinely scared about getting married to Rory in the morning. She's such an independent girl, that the prospect terrifies her - so given the chance she runs away the night before her wedding with her childhood hero and contemplates whether to go back.

In the end, it's the Doctor, by bringing Rory along, gets her to recognise that she shouldn't have just the life in the TARDIS. As a result of their adventures, she realises just how much she loves Rory and no longer has any qualms about getting married.

&gt;Am I just nitpicking too much?

Well, first of all, I'll say I really liked Season 5, more so than Season 6. But I do think both of them are, in general, a step above earlier seasons.

I don't think the Doctor was less intelligent this season. Rather, his personality (as with all regenerations) changed and he is more absent minded, or focuses on other things (""Never ignore a coincidence. Unless you're busy, in which case, always ignore a coincidence"").

I like Amy, but I also agree that Rory got the short straw this season. Still, that's nothing compared to Gwen and Rhys on Torchwood. My take on Amy is that, as soon as she saw the Doctor back, her mind didn't really click. And all her fears and insecurities from being told he was her ""imaginary friend"" affected her judgement. I do think that after Rory's death in the Dream Lord episode, and his badass-ness on The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang, Amy truly realized who she cared about.

true,pcjonathan,smith,Smith,"I'm not one of those reporting the meme's as there's so many and it would waste both the mods and my time hitting report (although I do often report anything that I find actually breaking the rules..which is a lot!) but I do agree. That comment that you linked to is perfectly correct. I have also gotten close to unsubbing from this subreddit (only to be temporarily persuaded out of it by a half-decent post every so often that I notice. A lot slip through).

I find simply saying to down-voting these to be totally and utterly hopeless. I mean, sure, that works for the people who only spend 1 minute of their day on reddit to look at what's hot and will but some of out, but I hope that the truly valued members of this subreddit use ""What's New"" instead, like I do, to read every post that's posted to this subreddit, or at least would do if most of the crap is removed. I find a lot of HQ posts are also down among them too, be it because the lazy people cba to read, think, etc, or people they just aren't seen enough for them to be upvoted.

This may not go down to well with people who are concerned about /r/doctorwho's Companion numbers but I reckon that this subreddit should be split up. For example, all the meme's should be moved to a new subreddit. This way people who still want the stuff can sub to that one and we get less tearful crap here and hopefully more chance to read some fantastic posts.

But let's be clear about this. Personally, I'm not seeing this as an opportunity to improve the quality of the content in the short run, but to reduce the quantity of low quality content and, hopefully, this will therefore mean that people who will be arsed to do higher quality content will start joining us, so hopefully it **will** improve the quality of the content in the long run (although this possibly wouldn't be seen for a long while).

I'd also like to mention another rule that is in place and that is the one about pirated Doctor Who episodes. Now I'm not disagreeing with it, but I find it fairly annoying that it links straight to a subreddit where only it's owner, however cool he may be, can post anything thereby locking everyone else out from sharing anything anywhere. I think that possibly that rule should also be straightened out a bit more, for example, banning all illegal things from **this** subreddit (such as illegal streaming, downloading, etc) and putting them in another subreddit, therefore people still have access but the great mods here aren't under any duress, even less so as it would be easier and clearer. 

As well as this rule, I also think the repost rule should be tightened up a tad. I often find myself seeing something that is months, if not years, old reposted 2 or more times in the same day. How on earth could this happen without people reposting on purpose? Also, things with the same theme, for example, ""I forgot...."" or ""HOLY HELL! I saw a sign with the word RIVER on it!"".

Similar to people not reading the FAQ argument. Sure, they MAY be valued members several weeks down the line, but I often think to myself whether or not we would want people who can't see that damn big button to the right, or read the warning when doing the post.

I'm happy to help start up/moderate those subreddits with someone (although I may think twice about the meme's one) if /r/doctorwho's mods thinks it's a good idea.

Now...I'm sure I must have thought of about 6 things to add while typing that but I forgot them. :( Oh well. Hopefully it'll come back to me. I think that this possibly may need to be made into a proper poll with something like polldaddy to decide. Unfortunatly though..most of the people we would have liked and would have voted yes may have gotten fed up enough and left already.

The other difference is that many of the insurers have maximum rates for procedures which are less than the minimum that specialists will charge - basically it's a fiddle.

Doctor Who is a series all about changes.  Doctors change, companions change, the design of the TARDIS changes, the show and plots change as showrunners change.

You are too stuck in how it was in the RTD era which is, I might add, a relatively small period of time in the entire existence of Doctor Who.  

Matt Smith's Doctor is not going to be like David Tennant's Doctor.  He is written intentionally to be different as each Doctor is.  That said, a lot of your nitpicks (no plan, childishness, companion saving the day) seem to indicate your attitude as the reason for these complaints because they exist clearly in the RTD era as well, you just didn't see it there.

I didn't look deep enough to find a case similar to this advertisement but I've never seen a law firm advertise this way in America. I am 100% certain that it is unethical to do so in the State of New York. 

Why? Lets face it big pharma gets away with their peddling because of lawyers. Lawyers will fight each other with everything they've got to keep a level playing field. Offering incentives or prizes for services is not allowed.

What will Hilary Meredith's rival law firms do, will they offer a 7 day cruise to the Bahamas or a nice car? That is not ethical there must be some loophole Meredith is using. I can't have you guys let me believe that the British legal system is like this.

Kuyt is where attacks go to die. He is past his prime and should never start over maxi or Bellamy while they are fit. I appreciate all the work he has put in over the years but like carragher he needs to be phased out. Bellamy has been our best ""winger"" by far, he is basically a better version of downing at the moment. It's too bad he has the knees of a camel and can't play much.  He is fantastic. 

Downing is far too predictable, which would be ok of he actually got decent crosses into the box but that rarely happens. He can't shoot either. He ends up running down the wing then passing back to enrique or Johnson, or just rips a terrible shot.

I have never really liked Adam, he is far too inconsistent. His set pieces (what we bought him for) have also been horrendous. I prefer Henderson over Adam any day of the week. He does go missing sometimes but he gives his all. He seems to link up well with gerrard as well. Spearing is adequate cover for Lucas but the gap left behind is still quite noticeable against the better teams. 

Our biggest issue with Carroll is that NOBODY bar gerrard seems to know how to put a decent cross in. We don't play to his strengths and leave him isolated. It is such a waste as it is frustrating for not only the fans, but for Carroll himself. You can see him trying hard but he really can't do much up on his own. Either way I still don't feel he is a proper fit for our team. It really is a pity because he could be a tremendous player with the right ppl surrounding him. You can see why commoli and Kenny made some of the signings they did, but a few really have not worked out.

1. NGE2004 hit it on the head with submissions that have nothing to do with Doctor Who except the title i.e. don't do it.

2. I am not a big fan of the memes (I have submitted a couple though). I do not typically find them amusing but mostly they are at least relevant so I say leave them alone.

3. What really irritates me on this sub-reddit is when someone takes a screen shot from an episode and types out the exact dialog from that scene over the screen shot. I (personally) do not see the value of these posts. 

4. I think it is cool when someone finds a new or neat Who item we can buy then posts it. Still cool when a week later someone else posts ""look what I got in the mail!"" (previous week's item). That being said, if I see one more Van Gogh exploding Tardis print I will march into the kitchen, firmly grab my [melon baller](http://www.dimensionsguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Melon-Baller.jpg) and scoop my eyes out.

Adam Johnson - Depending on what Man City do in this transfer window. He's not a regular starter for him as it is, if they buy more players in January he could look for a move away? He's young, British and has PL experience so matches the type we've been buying recently. 

Marc Albrighton - Similar to AJ, IMO one of Villa's better players. And Villa's owners are known to sell their better players (Barry/Milner/Young/err Downing). 

Stephen Ireland - Hasn't seemed to settle at Villa. Bit hit and miss but shows promise at times (the recent Chelsea game for example). 

Niko Kranjcar / Steven Pienaar - Seem to have been forgotten about and underused at Spurs. 

Steven Fletcher - In form striker, young and British. 

Chris Eagles - Only signed for Bolton in the Summer so perhaps too soon for him to move again. Has looked good in a team that hasn't. Is ex-Man United though so might not be willing to join Liverpool. 

Clint Dempsey - The American connection that the owners could work with. He's very versatile on the pitch and, no offence to Fulham, deserves to be playing for a big club. 

Bryan Ruiz - New guy at Fulham, have watched him play a few times and he's impressed. 

Torres - Been shit at Chelsea and blatantly regrets ever leaving. ;)",0,1325729825,null,0,true,0,c3e12tl,t3_o2e7e,t1_c3e12tl,t3_o2e7e,null,1428125334,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I was pretty sure that Britain's chance of recovering its status as a superpower following the war was utterly destroyed by the punishment doled out **by the American government** for Britain electing a socialist government (Labour in May 1945). The punishment being: cancelling Lend-Lease (August 1945) and forcing Britain to tank its economy in exchange for a loan it desperately needed: the Anglo-American loan agreement (July 1946).

Granted, the biggest deal was the war, it bankrupted the UK but the US stomped on any chance of a recovery through those two actions. 
For Santorum to suggest this period of miserable economics was due to us trying to setup the NHS just shows a lack of historical understanding. Quite frankly it renders the honourable gentleman a complete cunt for not remembering how his country screwed ours over and trying to spin it like we tripped ourselves up.

To make it clear how bad things were: 

* the war ended in 1945, 
* Britain didn't stop rationing till 1955 

Surely that paints a picture, does it not?

The Brit who went over to negotiate the Anglo American loan agreement: [John Maynard Keynes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes) died during the negotiations, after suffering a series of heart attacks. He described the negotiations as: ""absolute hell"".

true,spacehipster,smith,Smith,"Okay you have a lot of tangents here.  Though I have to say, if you're not a fan of the ""power of love"" you might be watching the wrong show.  It happens all the time in plenty of variations throughout the show.

First of all, I don't think that Amy and Rory are intended to be ""average people"".  Amelia Pond is extraordinary.  It's brought up constantly in the narrative.  She grew up believing in the Doctor and aliens and all of his stories.  She's not like Rose, whom he picked up off the street and so she developed differently.  Rory, with his strong faith and will, represents some of the best of humanity and also grew up hearing of the Doctor.  That said, they still get shocked and upset by the things they see and experience such as in A Good Man Goes to War and The Girl Who Waited.

As for their families, well... it doesn't really make much sense to have them there.  Rory is clearly an adult who lives on his own, Amy's parents were erased and then in the new universe, she lives with her husband.  Their families aren't really important, its the relationship between the Ponds that counts.  I personally always felt that aside from Rose's mum because Rose lived with her and Wilf, the inclusion of the families were extraneous and added too many characters that added nothing to the show..

As for the Doctor, well... I never really believed he would ever be killed at any point.  And I don't think you're supposed to.  Obviously he'll always get out of it (or regenerate).  I think the fun is supposed to be a ""oh how does he get out of this one"" as opposed to ""oh is he going to die!"".

true,GooGooGajoob67,tennant,Tennant,"Yeah, it can be confusing, especially overseas.  I'll try to break it down.  You take your letter of request, your photo, an SASE (which I typically fold in half), and a piece of cardboard to protect the photo (if you want, but it will add to your postage and you may have to fill out a customs form) and put it inside an outer envelope.

For the SASE, you put your address on the front, making sure you put USA under the line that has your city.  As for the return address, you don't need to put one, but sometimes I do, and just put my own address again.  Remember that in the UK, return addresses go along the bottom of the closure flap.  Write ""AIR MAIL/PAR AVION"" where US return addresses would go, and ""DO NOT BEND"" on the front somewhere.  As for the postage, you can use IRCs (and if you can acquire them, and you might have more luck in a city, you do paperclip them as you said), which can be bought here in the States and exchanged for local postage in other countries.  Unfortunately, they're pretty rare, and every time I've asked for them the postal clerk looks at me like I have six eyes.  So what I ended up doing was going to the ""Wanted"" forum on fanmail.biz and found a woman from Britain who needed American stamps, worked out a fair exchange with her, and swapped.  When I'm putting together a UK SASE, I weigh my envelope, photo, and (maybe) cardboard and use the Royal Mail website to determine how much postage I will need.

For your outer envelope, write your return address where it would normally go here, in the top left corner.  Write the celebrity's address in the center, obviously.  Put ""DO NOT BEND"" on this one, as well.  As for postage, I take it to the post office just to be sure I get it right.  You also may need to fill out a customs form, as I said, if the envelope is stiff.  No biggie, you just have to list what's in it.  I just put ""photo, letter"", and they seem to be happy with that.

Oh, and if you're writing to Matt Smith, all you get from him are pre-signed postcards with an inscription by someone-who-isn't-Matt.  Slightly disappointing, but the point is, don't bother with a photo 'cause you'll just get it back unsigned.  Just send an SASE big enough for a postcard, and you can fold that into a normal-sized envelope rather than the 9x12 you would use for a standard photo.

uk-repair.com is a private domain registration, but a couple of the other domains reveal that they belong to a Francisco Azevedo of 366 Ruislip Road, Middlesex, UB5 6BH. This is the address included on the WHOIS for [http://gadgetrepairsupport.com](http://whois.domaintools.com/gadgetrepairsupport.com) for example, which was only created on 19th Jan 2011. The site [blackberryunlock.co.uk](http://blackberyunlock.co.uk/contact-us/) has the same 0800 phone number and address on their 'contact us' page.

[e-repairs.co.uk](http://www.e-repairs.co.uk) points to Francisco Azevedo, this time living at 36 Churchill Court, Newmarket Avenue, Northolt, UB5 4EP. Possibly his previous address.

There is a 'legitimate' electronics repair business operating out of the same building, called 'Gizmo Repairs Ltd' with a Mr Kambiz Davari as the director.

My top choice would be Vertonghen, who apparentl should be available for somewhere around the 10-15m mark. I think he'll be the perfect foil for the powerful game of Kaboul/Caulker over the next few years, while also offering cover at LB (which is good seeing as our current cover there is very inexperienced - ideally we'd send Rose off to get some games on loan somewhere for the second half of the season if this one came off). I'd also be interested in Cahill or Coloccini if Vertonghen isn't viable. And I like Tomkins who I think we've been linked with. I don't consider Samba a good option at all - not the type of player we need, he's a slow Kaboul.

Like most, I'd like to see us upgrade on Pav too. My choices would depend on how we see things panning out with Adebayor. If we expect to keep him long term I'd be looking at bringing in someone like Jones, Gignac, maybe Zamora, maybe even Berbatov, to compete with Defoe for the main striker back up spot. I think we need a player in this role who can facilitate the play of our excellent midfield more than we need a true goalscorer - that's for the other three to concentrate on. Our fourth forward should be someone who can come into the team and push around and occupy the attention of a defence the way that Adebayor does, creating the time and space for our midfield to work their magic. This is Pav's biggest failing as a player.

If we're expecting to lose Adebayor after this season then I'd want to splash out on the big name striker now to give him half a year to bed in before he becomes the main man upfront next season. My top choices would be the same as most: Leandro, Doumbia, Sow, maybe Soldado. Tough call, and maybe difficult to land before the summer (when I expect we'll be able to offer the promise of CL football, as well as higher wages if the NDP is confirmed to go ahead by then)

Beyond that a fast option on the wings would be great, ideally someone who can play both sides - we do seem to lose a lot when even one out of Lennon and Bale is missing. I hear Hoillett bandied round a lot. I like him, but he is quite lightweight. My preference would be for Moses. He's quick, strong, and can play right across the frontline. Think he'd come along well alongside the better class of player we have at Spurs.

Buying a keeper is obviously on the horizon, but that can wait until the summer. We shouldn't need to risk shopping outside the league for this one when it comes - as noted by everyone who's watched any football this year Krul and Vorm are the choices (Vorm edges it for me), but we should look at Al-habsi and Begovic too, maybe even Foster.

Hopefully we'll see Dos Santos leave permanently for a decent fee as well as Pav. Thudd is back soon so getting Livermore placed with a PL team for the rest of the season would do him the world of good - Fulham could do with a CM like him. This likely depends on how long Sandro'll be out for though.

Then there's the Kranjcar/Pienaar question - we have a big squad, and at least one of this two is not going to play much. Kranjcar has real quality and I'd hate to lose him, but I'm going to go against prevailing opinion and plump for Pienaar because of his versatility. We need players like that, covering three or four positions from the bench - he's our Ji-sung Park. And people seem to have forgotten the quality he displayed during his years at Everton. Even so I'd hope this is a bit of business that can wait until the summer either way.

On Monday night, there was one registrar in the hospital. On Tuesday night in the ward where my FIL is, there were 3 nurses to 23 patients. 6 were listed as critical at the start of the shift and one died during the shift. Throughout the night, alarms went unattended at most beds because the nurses just couldn't cope with the workload. 

On Monday, they forgot to send a sample for examination because they got pulled off of working with him onto something else and forgot to come back to him. Now he has to have ANOTHER needle into his lung to draw another sample. He's not looking forward to that. 

The surgeon who botched my vasectomy was an NHS surgeon too. It takes on average 18 calls to get through to his secretary / receptionist. Right now, you can't even leave a voicemail because they've run out of space on the voicemail system, so apparently it's not just me trying to get hold of him. 

I sat at Newham hospital in December while a urologist tried to work out what had gone wrong with the original surgery. A sign on the door in front of me said 'Do not enter. Room Infested.' Not infected you'll note; infested!

That's really not true. Granted, there will be poorly run private enterprises, but sooner or later they fail.

The primary goal of a private business is efficiency. They are therefore very good at it, in the general case. The primary goal of a public enterprise is providing its service to a good quality to the end user for a reasonable (or free) price, decided by government.

There is less incentive in the public sector to be efficient, as that may affect their core service adversely and that's their primary goal. They are also not incentivised through bonuses to reduce cost to the enterprise. Add to that the ""job for life"" mentality and powerful unions in the public sector and you have a massive potential for bloat, where poor workers get kept on because they are unable to be fired.

A serious contender would be Romeu for me. He's a DMC but I still think worthy. The team has looked better with him there and much more solid.

However, by far our best defender so far has been Ashley Cole. Look at how we roll our coverage to help the RB and how little gas been created from the left channel (except from deep when Mata has moved more central). That alone would be enough to identify the consistent quality he's played with. He's also got forward and provided a threat and seems to run all day.

Diane Abbott is a racist. What she said was racist. Her weak defence and attempt at explaining herself also reveals her as a liar.

Here's the thing; what she said is true...but it's not ""white people"", it's the elite, an elite that ironically Diane Abbott is part of! Look what she's done. By a single utterance on Twitter she now has people of all races, who unlike her are *not* in the upper echelons of politics, and unlike her can *not* choose to send their kids to private school, fighting amongst ourselves.

If that's not divide and rule, what is Diane?

When shady people in offices and gentlemen's clubs you're not allowed into sit with their cigars and a glass of port to decide the lives of the average citizen with a wink and a handshake, yes there's a large possibility that person is white...but there's 100% possibility that person is incredibly wealthy and influential and they don't care about the colour of the people they're screwing over. And they don't care about the colour of the people that help them do that screwing over, just as long as those people are of equal standing and went to the same elite schools...you know, the schools you're wealthy enough to send *your* kids to Diane.

One day *your* kids, after their elite education, rubbing shoulders with the countries future bankers, financiers and business magnates, may find themselves in politics like mummy. They may find they're having friendly lunches with old buddies...just innocent little meals over drinks with old school chums. At some point a legislation that may or may not affect this old friends business comes up...at some point the question of campaign and party donations comes up...at some point promises are made to ask certain questions to certain people that one of the friends knows...at some point a handshake and a wink passes over the now forgotten meal. Your kids Diane, your black kids. Not because of their colour, but because they'll be in a special club.

Yes, it's a club that's full of rich white blokes, but we're in fucking Britain! These same shady restaurant deals are happening in Japan, Nigeria, India and Russia and chances are the people doing it are most likely ""indigenous"" to those lands.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Really? First of all many are excluded due to medical problems. Secondly many with poor driving records won't even get a provisional HGV licence. Finally the test failure rates suggest otherwise, especially when you consider that up until recently, anyone taking their test would have held a car licence for up to 4 years. When I took my C+E test, I was the only person out of 8 to pass that day.

Yep, hence why I said *pretty much* anyone. Relatively few people will be excluded due to medical issues. Approximately 85% of people have clean driving records, and I assume some points on a license wouldn't prevent someone getting the relevant qualifications, although it might limit employment opportunities.

Test failure rates might be high (as are ordinary driving tests in certain parts of the country), but I imagine these tests can be retaken? I doubt many people would undergo all the relevant training then pack the whole thing in when they fail the test!

So I stand by my point that *pretty much* anyone can do the job. If I had to put a figure on it, I'd guess that 75% of the adult population would have the necessary skills and qualifications, if they had the inclination, to do the job.

true,quickqthrowawy,null,null,"Wow, you just went on ahead and wrote up your own subcontext for this one based on little to nothing didn't you? 

Look I don't know wtf happened to you in a past life, or who tried to screw you over- but your aggressive attitude and condescension is far from necessary. Also, your just plain disgusting assumption that I would do something immoral to find out a dirty piece of information like this is just down right offensive.

To set the record straight, I was promised a pay rise after three months in my position - I was told at interview that the abnormally low salary was only low because I was a temporary worker and once I endured the 'trial' period, they would increase my salary. They did the same with my colleague - who I work closely with and am good friends with.

When they renewed her salary, they increased her pay - which she discussed with me as we were both promised the same thing at interview and we were both aware of as an expectation for us both. However, when my renewal came up last month, my boss told me he'd never said he'd promised me an increase- and then when I pushed him admitted he had, but that the firm couldn't afford it (despite over £2000 spend on corporate dinners and gifts for partners last month).

As for your catty remarks about degree vs experience, I'm disgusted that again you assume I'm some disgruntled graduate thinking I'm worth more than I am with nothing but theories in my head. My question was a genuine one and I kept it simple - that doesn't mean I'm hiding anything or that I'm an arrogant bitch. I've been doing similar jobs in VERY high profile environments for 3 years - my colleague has no previous experience for the role. However even a quick google will tell you that experience means fuck all in the grand scheme of doing the job - which by the way she does excellently and I bear no grudges against a fellow worker. I admit her work ethic and her ability is the same as mine.

However, I work longer hours and am required to do some specialised work due to my **experience** - NOT my degree. My post-grad gave me a foundation, but the last three years is my experience. Again, a quick google tells me that experience does not make any difference to the job in the UK - I read one famous case where a woman working 2yr and a guy working 10yrs were being paid very differently, however the tribunal ruled that his extended experience did not affect his ability to do the job and she was awarded appropriately. Therefore I am not suggested that my additional experience means I should get more - I only think it fair I be offered the SAME. I do not know if I have any legal backing to this, but to me it seems morally wrong and I wanted to find out if the law agrees with me on that. 

So - again, don't know what you're problem is, but my situation isn't it - so unless you have something constructive to add that actually addresses the facts of my situation rather than your own fabrications, I'd thank you not to comment again.

Oh, and the only semi-sort-of-question, for the record, myself and my colleague are the same age (I'm a year older, but that's nothing really), we're the same sex, different religions (which are of no matter - backgrounds are both Christian, although I'm an atheist but I don't advertise it), and we're both of pretty much a similar race (majoritively white).

true,KyotoWolf,cnty-wales,Wrexham/Chester/Leicester,"&gt; I thought the Renaissance was largely sparked by the crusades.

Largely, but not for the reasons you state. It wasn't particularly Muslim knowledge that sparked the technological advances of the Renaissance (and eventual Scientific Revolution in 1543), but influx of classical sources following the  Fourth Crusades sack of Constantinople in 1202 and the 1453 Fall of Constantinople. This allowed greater access to the classical sources, allowing study. These works however, were sometimes incomplete, and sometimes conflicted with known knowledge, so scholars had to fill in the gaps with their own empirical research (the 're'birth of the scientific method). This eventually led to the 2 big works of Vesalius and Copernicus in 1543. However, it wasn't just that. It was a combination of re-emphasis on the classical sources, a destigmatisation of questioning the classical sources, an encouraging attitude of the Church towards the Secular natural philosophy (natural philosophy helped understand gods creation kind of thing), and others I can't quite recall. 

Now that I write this I realise I've digressed from talking about the Renaissance, to talking about the Scientific Revolution, and failed to note that the Renaissance and misconception of the 'Dark Ages' were more than technological. The renaissance was about culture, art, and politics as well as technology, and the Dark Ages myth about economy and cultural degeneration. I'd write about why the Dark Ages weren't dark, but it'd quickly turn into an essay, so I'll just give you this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages_(historiography)

I am planning to speak to my boss, but he's just taken a three week holiday =( - So I was going to speak to my line manager- who is also a Director of the firm. He really likes me and is determined to keep me around, so I think telling him about this is going to go down like a lead Zeppelin...! The Director handling the finances is 15 - 20 years younger than the other two, and has never run a business, whereas the other two are seasoned veterans. I think that the younger Director handling the finances is going a bit renegade and he's trying to do it secretly =/ I'm concerned that if I raise this, it will cause problems that might cost me my job! I realise I'm not the one at fault, but at the end of the day these guys are in business together - I'm just one employee....

Before the xmas period, my temp contract ran out (22nd Dec) and the younger Director told me he would renew my contract the next year - however this would mean I couldn't work for two weeks (due to the holiday) and therefore couldn't earn any money. When I expressed my fears and severe disappointment (I had been already told I wasn't getting the pay increase, so I was upset, but not as much as I am now as I wasn't aware at this stage my colleague was being paid more), he backtracked and claimed it wasn't his decision - all the Director's had to decide, and he told me to ask them about it (don't know why he told me to investigate it - maybe he hoped I wouldn't mention him?)

I did so, and the other two Directors were baffled - they had no knowledge of this and they were also (from their expressions) shocked at my query - and insisted I should be, and would be, paid for the Christmas period. One of the Director's comforted me by explaining that the young Director's insecurities about the firm were getting to him.

Also, I would disagree that Amy's whiny - she was quite resolute that the Doctor should leave her behind when she thought her hand had turned to stone.

true,Geofferic,essex,"Bloody Barkingside, Wot!","As someone experienced with the US, UK and Japanese healthcare systems... The UK system is the worst.  

I understand that if you see the financial burden as the most important aspect that it's great.  But as far as the quality of care, the knowledge of the front-line people, the maze-like nature of some of the bureaucracy, the degree of non-medical-personnel power over your care, etc ... UK BLOWS.

Granted, you aren't likely to go bankrupt over a broken leg.  That's a massive positive over the US system.  No doubt about it what-so-ever and I won't argue that.

There are many great things about the UK system.  Frendoc is a fantastic service.  When one finally gets to see a relevant physician, they are well-trained (oddly, I have so far only had one UK-trained physician - he was great, tho).  The technology, when available, is top-notch.  (Sadly, often-times there is *no* modern tech available without waiting or leaving the country.  Odd.)

The US system is pretty much the best medicine you can buy *AND* you can get it *RIGHT NOW*.  The immediacy of the system is the primary driver of costs, tho nobody wants to admit that.  The lack of any filter in the system to keep people with a splinter and no insurance from hitting up the emergency room is really ridiculous.  That there is no system-wide scheme has caused the massive amount of free and cheap healthcare to go unused and simply unknown.  The lack of a national ID makes consolidating the systems very difficult and tracking patients impossible.  The lack of real tort controls puts such a financial burden on doctors (and their insurers) that every single procedure has to turn a massive profit to justify the potential risk of mistakes or even non-mistakes.  Defending a law suit that's total bullshit can ruin a doctor.

The Japanese system is the sweet spot.  You get quick care.  You can walk-in.  You can get cheap private or state insurance.  You can get expensive LUXURY insurance.  You can see a doc-in-the-box or a family GP or have a boutique physician with only 100 patients.  Healthcare is not expensive like in the states, but it costs just enough to keep people from abusing it.  There is very little bureaucratic red tape between the patient and the doctors and nurses.  The people manning the desks are super polite, discreet and helpful.  You can get the same doctor every time if you like without having to schedule 2 weeks in advance.  Unlike in the UK, you *can* schedule appointments pretty much whenever you want - and unlike in the States, that won't cost you an arm and a leg.

When I see people in Europe or the Americas brag about their healthcare it makes me laugh.  Despite many ageing doctors in Japan, the entire system (top to bottom, side to side) is superior in every way.

&gt;There is less incentive in the public sector to be efficient, as that may affect their core service adversely and that's their primary goal.

The primary goal of a health service is to provide the best total health outcome for a population given the amount of money put in. A company that cuts services is not more efficient, since it is not achieving the best outcome for the cost. Instead it is more profitable. Given the inputs and outputs it has *exactly* the same potential for bloat; the difference is that bloat in the private sector means paying executives more/giving money to the owners, while in the public sector it means hiring an excess of workers.

Or:

&gt;That's really not true. Granted, there will be poorly run private enterprises, but sooner or later they fail.

&gt; Diane Abbott is a racist. What she said was racist. 

Does the latter absolutely imply or demand the former? What I mean is, one can utter a sexist, racist or homophobic remark without necessarily meaning it. Make an off the cuff remark without choosing your words correctly then realise and ""Oh shit no that's not what I meant!""

Has she apologised for causing offence, or apologised for what she actually said and meant? I would say only the former, as she appears to be giving the impression that she did not mean what she said. But as you say it is a weak defence. She claims her words were taken out of context though it's hard to see how she could have meant what she said historically when 1) She used the present (is that right?) tense and 2) She spoke of colonialism as being old.

For the record, she had 53 characters left to play with, but even adding only *one* character she could have said ""White people love**d** to play..."".

Although of course I really have no cause to gripe, due to being a white 'middle' class educated male, comments like this does cause me some concern/alarm/worry. Here I shall quickly make a note to distance myself from people (some around here) who think that therefore I'm somehow being oppressed and need particular 'rights' given to me... numpties. Of course this should worry anyone of any race, but I mean ""White people"" comment as it is directed/talking about *me*. I see a generalisation from someone who could easily represent me in parliament (as I come from an area of London quite close to Hackney) speaking of *me* as though I am an oppressor, as though *I* have some sort of agenda and would like nothing more than to keep some people down simply because they have a slightly different skin pigmentation to *me*. Rather insulting and very far from the truth with regards to, I imagine and hope, the majority of people in this country.

Again - I don't actually feel oppressed in any way, shape or form, but I can recognise the sentiment behind an ""Us &amp; Them"" comment.

As you've pointed out so eloquently in your post, ironically Diane Abbot is inside the system (and taking part in it - children in private school) that can/is causing trouble in various communities and apparently doesn't seem to appreciate that.

Cole was second for me, if that makes a difference.  Terry has certainly been performing better with the deeper block that Chelsea has moved to, but he wasn't performing *horrible* before that. The problem is that everyone else around him was performing so poorly it was bringing him down as well. Terry was trying to cover for Luiz going forward too much, Cole occasionally getting beat 1 v 1, and especially Ivanovic/Bosingwa when they were paired at CB/RB.  It is no surprise that Terry's performances have seemed to improve so much with Luiz playing more like a traditional back and Ivanovic at RB instead of the error prone Bosingwa. 

Romeu wasn't eligible since he is a midfielder, but even still he's played less than 1000 minutes in the EPL and Champions League this season. I agree that his presence has been a revelation and the team has performed better with him over Mikel, but he's played less than half of the games.

&gt; Third parties may wish to store information on the equipment of a user, or gain access to information already stored, for a number of purposes, ranging from the legitimate (such as certain types of cookies) to those involving unwarranted intrusion into the private sphere (such as spyware or viruses). It is therefore of paramount importance that users be provided with clear and comprehensive information when engaging in any activity which could result in such storage or gaining of access. The methods of providing information and offering the right to refuse should be as user-friendly as possible. Exceptions to the obligation to provide information and offer the right to refuse should be limited to those situations where the technical storage or access is strictly necessary for the legitimate purpose of enabling the use of a specific service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user. Where it is technically possible and effective, in accordance with the relevant provisions of Directive 95/46/EC, the user’s consent to processing may be expressed by using the appropriate settings of a browser or other application. The enforcement of these requirements should be made more effective by way of enhanced powers granted to the relevant national authorities.

I haven't read the whole thing, but with a ctrl+f this was the only reference I could find on this. This is pretty ambiguous but I could argue that visiting my website constitutes a specific request and if its necessary for my security purposes I can send a session cookie to you. I can't track you for marketing data though. This will piss marketing people off.

Our government has this in law somewhere (found after crap loads of junk data that didn't reference anything legal so I can't remember where it was):

&gt; a person shall not store or gain access to information stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user unless the requirements of paragraph (2) are met.

As a young'un I remember the day it all started, the local loyalists did their protest and looked like a bunch of idiots, blocking roads, burning stuff in their own villages etc... most people were embarassed to live here.

I remember seeing the spokesman for the Nationalists on TV and there was just something about him that everyone I've ever met hated.

He just inspired pure hate from everyone, including me.  It wasnt stated but there was just a feeling that he was a sinister creep of a man.  If you look him up on wiki, he's quite hardcore.  I think his motives werent completely pure, it wasnt about redressing the balance to a point where there'd be a compromise, I think he just wanted to fuck everyone else off.

So, No republican violence but I think plenty of activism and inciting the idiots on the loyalist side.. Worked quite well, they burned their own areas.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"&gt; Diane Abbott is a racist. What she said was racist. 

Your prose is indeed powerful, but I don't genuinely believe that Diane Abbot is a racist. Does anyone here think that she would force a white old man to give up a seat on a bus? That the content of her actions deserves her to be vilified? I find conservative attitudes towards the poor more sickening than what she said.

What Diane Abbot said was not racist but, perhaps, racially insensitive. There is a difference. And its FUCKING HUGE. 

We all say and do insensitive things; what separates us from barbarians is the ability to forgive that which can be undone. We cannot build a decent society if we don't allow people the space to make small mistakes.

I think she made a mistake; she badly worded a tweet. For &lt; 140 characters of her saying something that isn't even genuinely offensive you have called her a racist and said that she should loose her job. This is ridiculous; Abbott knows first hand the suffering and social strife that racism causes and to group her in that category is entirely unfair.

In fact, to be honest, what you said is more borderline than what she said on the insensitive. I know you understand the pain genuine racism has caused over the years; the stigma, the inability to get work, suffering, people refusing friendship or much worse unspeakable horrific crimes like the murder of an individual human being who had the indignation to wait for a bus in the wrong place at the wrong time. By all means insult her for playing the shitty game that is British politics but don't compare her to the likes of the hideous people that have existed and still exist today.

In the summer Starkey said ""The whites have become blacks"". So because we have failed to fix our social issues, as a collective community of all ethnicities, it is the fault and culture of one ethnicity? The riots were a failing of us all as a collective, most notably the politicians and educators of our age. That's racism; the genuine belief that someone else's culture is to blame for the failing of your own society.

&gt; Unison’s wish to have Clarkson sacked and possibly prosecuted for inciting murder is pure fascism, it is worse than Clarkson being mouthy. No-one is going to murder trade unionists because Clarkson said that they should be shot in front of their families. Equally, hatred is not a virtue, but hating is not a crime and voicing hate should not be a crime. If someone hates something or someone or a group of people (Asians, bankers, the upper class, the working class), no matter how irrational it is, they have the right to express that hatred and I have the right to tell them they are a prick. But you can’t legislate against opinions, no matter how ill-informed or prejudiced.

Your response conflates things - I said nothing about cutting services. Yes, to an extent that requires *stopping doing things that add no value*, which could be cutting non-utilised end services or it could be to outsource or contract where it is cheaper to employ an external company than do X inhouse.

My main point on efficiency comes back to my opening statement - public services are given a budget and provided they operate within that budget they have no incentive to cut costs. Indeed, if they don't use up their budget they will have it cut next year so that is if anything a disincentive to reduce unnecessary outgoings.

true,coriny,eng-GreaterLondon,London?,"&gt; My main point on efficiency comes back to my opening statement - public services are given a budget and provided they operate within that budget they have no incentive to cut costs. Indeed, if they don't use up their budget they will have it cut next year so that is if anything a disincentive to reduce unnecessary outgoings.
A private business could generally not afford to operate like that. It'd want to know exactly where every penny is going and if it is required, and incentivises managers to reduce costing.

Actually this happens in many businesses as departments compete for funding and turf. I'm really not sure where you get this idea that businesses run with ruthless efficiency and with a focus on economy. For a start, even in business it is not necessarily possible to accurately determine cost-return ratios (how much should you spend on HR?), which means efficiency optimisation can only go so far - let alone remove politics from the process.

Businesses succeed and fail through many mechanisms. Efficiency is useful, but the failure of quants in business, suggest that it is not the main factor. Take, for instance, Google. They did not beat MS at search through having a more efficient business, they won through better technology. In fact Google is quite happy to spraff money all over the place, just to see if something sticks.

So... the aim of the NHS is to provide the maximum impact given the budget decided on by the government - this is exactly an efficiency optimisation problem. Efficiency is maximising the return for a given input and the NHS is the worlds' best at this. The entire process of the last ten years has been about examining how to best use available money to maximise health outcomes, with NICE being at the vanguard.

Some vague ideology about the NHS having no incentive to improve is clearly wrong. People working in health services care passionately about their patients; combine that with the relentless comparisons to exceptional health care instances in other countries and the political pressure, there is in fact a strong drive to efficiency. It's pretty much the mantra in the NHS is that wasted money kills people.

So I hope you can drop this view of that generic corporations are lean and efficient, since it is mainly not that relevant to their success, while learning that the NHS is one of the most efficiency-driven organisations there is.",0,1325775335,null,0,false,0,c3e620j,t3_o2o72,t1_c3e620j,t1_c3e5vtw,null,1428127741,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

You say it's an extremely small amount - yes it is, especially as the firm is having a turn over of over 300k. So, as one of only two employees of that firm, the discrepancy to me is more invalid - NOT less. I am not in a high position, and do not command a great salary as it is. 

I lost my 'career-job' last year, and took this one at a FAR diminished salary with the promise that I would be built up and trained within the firm, with their view that I would look after my specialism within a year or two. The firm is doing well, however I am not being compensated as promised when someone else is, and when I've been told that someone else may not be kept on when I am doing so well that they don't think they need two of us. It could be a long term money saving measure - how could I know?

You have told me your interpretation of the law does not entitle me to the same wage. That was my question, and you have provided me an answer. Thank you for that. However on the issue of my case to justify an increase, I can easily make one, but there is no where for me to go if they reject my case - there are no jobs in my area and for the meantime while I'm waiting on other applications to process I am stuck here.

I know we live in this culture of support the employer over the employee, but Jesus, seeing it first hand is an eye-opener.

I don't think I do a better job - I've been TOLD I do an ""excellent"" job, that my work is ""absolutely fantastic"" as is my productivity - and that I am doing so well, and so much work that ""the directors are no longer sure they need to keep &lt;my colleague&gt; on, as I can handle so much on my own"". This is from the Director who chose to not elevate my salary - sure it could be all BS, but when everyone seems to give me 5 out of 5, and I've had my responsibilities increased twice and already brought on several new business opportunities - well... I'd say that the chances are that they're trying to get me as cheaply as possible rather than it be a performance basis decision.

For the record - I think I do a fine job, and that I do as well as she does. I have protected her more than once when these assertions have been made to me. I have a moral conscience, and just because I think I deserve equal pay to someone doing the same job, doesn't mean I'm just being contemptuous as some here might be assuming....

As for other factors, as I also stated before, I have a very friendly relationship with my colleague and she is aware I was not given the promised pay increased as she was. She expressed both surprise, anger and disappointment for me - I believe these sentiments to be genuine, if not, more fool me I guess.

For the record - The NHS should *not* be privatised. But putting your rose tinted specs on and saying large scale centrally managed systems are somehow just as good at managing bloat - they're not. The incentive is all at the coalface - those working with and interfacing with people. Those are the people who care.

true,McCackle,eng-sussex,West Sussex,"Well, sure - if we assume it's as simple as someone turning up with a bag marked SWAG then of course it's easy to blame the scrap merchant. But, of course, it's rarely that simple: not only is illegally obtained scrap difficult to identify as such when you have it isolated (memorial plaques - easy, BT cables - not really distinguishable from other cables), a lot of the time you will have illegal scrap hidden within a job lot of legal scrap. Not to mention an enterprising scrap thief might have done some pre-chopping/pre-processing themselves to render the stolen scrap unrecognisable.

The way scrap processing works in most yards is that the material is classified and sorted in an automated process by the machines/plant having been loaded in from a skip of unsorted/uninspected material.

Making the scrap yard owner entirely criminally responsible for someone else's criminality and a lack of decent industry regulation is unjust and risks devastating an industry which, though it needs modernisation, provides jobs and supports other industries (e.g. the recycling machinery industry).

To my mind, putting all the responsibility on the scrap yard owner is like blaming an ISP for a comment on one of the web sites of one of their customers on one of their servers - it fails to recognise the very real problems in managing the issue and puts the vast majority of operators in a situation where complying with the law would render them uncompetitive and unsustainable.

Don't get me wrong - I am disgusted by metal theft and am fully aware that the industry needs modernisation. But the reality is that action is needed in several areas: licensing and regulation of scrap dealing, transaction audit trails and tax records, protecting and identifying metal assets (chemical marking technology would be great but is probably too expensive to implement) - but it has to be *practical* action that really addresses the whole problem and not a satisfying but shallow kick at the most visible scapegoat.

What I'm really interested in is why you think these are different?

Let's say an apple is 20p. If my mission is to get 100 apples, then I will have to spend £20. If my mission is to get as many apples as I can on a budget of £20, I will get 100.

Now let's say that through efficiency drives I can get the cost of an apple down to 15p. Now I can get 100 apples for £15; equivalently I can get 133 for my £20 (with a little change).

So efficiency is the optimisation of unit cost irrespective of whether I'm optimising for the number of apples I can get for my money or the amount of money I need to spend to get the requisite number of apples.

I know three people who did IT at Napier (they were on placement with me at NHS IM&amp;T) and they seemed to think pretty highly of it. Napier is considered a bit ""meh"" by the types who go for snobbery, but when I visited their campus in 2007 they actually had a lot of awesome looking equipment. 

I didn't realise the entry requirement for HW was so high (this is where I've studied for 4.5 years now, btw); when I signed up the CS course needed BBBC at Higher including maths (which aren't as good as A-Levels, from what I've been told) and the Software Engineering MEng needed AABB. The MEng is definitely worth it if that's what you're going for, in your final year basically you get six months paid placement, then another semester which isn't as difficult (or at least, it doesn't look as if it's going to be as difficult... I start on Tuesday) as fourth year.

Don't worry about your friends being at Heriot-Watt either, after the first year on campus everyone tends to live in the city centre anyway, and Heriot-Watt's union has been dead for the past 2-3 years.

I don't recall hearing any kind of religious references when people oppose assisted suicide. Whilst faith is generally a religious term, it's is synonymous with hope which is something we all have at times, whether religious or not. What I mean is referring to it being a sin, hell, Jesus etc.

But you have to accept that assisted suicide places burden not only on the 'killer' but anyone who does not prevent it. To save a life is a big question to ask, to take one is almost impossible.

It's not an easy argument, and certainly not one to take lightly. I totally support it, but I can easily appreciate those who don't.

Again, in both cases what you can achieve depends on efficiency and the definition is the same for both. I feel like we're going in circles here. Let's forget apples and just call a ""service"" x. The quality of service (q) is limited to the range  0-1 so we can describe a high quality service as tending to x, while a low quality service tends to 0. The quality factor is determined by cost (c) multiplied by efficiency. So an efficient service will produce high quality at low cost and an inefficient service will produce low quality at high cost.

Now I'm a company that wants service x with a minimum level of quality (xq_min), so I just select the cost that produces where ec &gt; xq_min.

For the high quality public service we just want to maximise the value of x with a fixed value of c (not that this is how the NHS works but anyway ...). Therefore we just get ec worth of service. 

e (efficiency) is the same for both calculations - it simply relates the cost to the outcome. Is this clearer? I thought the apples were clearer but the maths is the same.

And while we're being a little patronising, please let me respond with this rant: Of course a company is about more than one item - in fact it's because of complexity theory that it is not possible for a company to definitely optimise internal efficiency. It's extensive work in the same area of mathematics that shows that local organisation for the optimum does NOT necessarily lead to optimisation of the system (essentially market theory was disproved &gt;20 years ago). Unfortunately it's the same maths that is now being completely misunderstood by the current government to create it's 'localism' agenda.

I would go and read some if I were you; there's some fascinating stuff about system organisation and it explains well why regulated markets can be very efficient at solution finding where there are large amounts of spare resources (allowing a high innovation &amp; failure rate), while rational systems are far more effective within a constrained environment. Unregulated markets are crap in almost all circumstances. It also demonstrates that you have to do proper tests on ideas (with controls etc, not the pathetic efforts at trials that governments and alternative health companies come up with) rather than making crude assumptions (""companies are efficient"", ""GPs will make more accurate choices"") in real world environments since outcomes are inherently unpredictable.

If you're further interested there have been some studies into GP-led systems, and they largely suggest no improvement in efficiency (cost versus medical outcomes) unless there is a strong management/regulatory layer on top.

true,wobinidan,null,null,"I grew up in a village in Kent where the only non-white people I knew of were the Chinese family that ran the Chinese restaurant over the road and the Pakistani family that ran the newsagent down the street.  

They were just people to me.   People that didn't live in my house, like all the other people in the village.

Then one day, our head teacher gave us a big lecture at the school assembly (when I was around 7 or 8).  He told us that there was this thing called race, and some people are different to us because they're from other places and they look different, but they're really the same as us and to observe those differences in the wrong way (whatever that is) is VERY VERY BAD and you're a BAD PERSON if you're a racist because we are all the same even though they are obviously different to us.

This really confused me and made me quite scared of being a racist.   In this village, which was 99.8% white, I might encounter a person that looks different to me (in my head, this meant black people because I hadn't seen one of those before, except on TV and the Chinese and Pakistani families I was already used to, and I was pretty sure I wasn't racist against them).

The result was that I was petrified of black people for the next decade.  Not scared of them personally, but scared of talking to them in case I said something racist.   It's still something that exists in the back of my mind.   

I guess the point is that I wish no one had ever told me that race exists, because until the day we got that lecture, I honestly had no concept of people being different on the basis of how they looked.   It's a burden that most of us don't need - as white people in a white country, we don't need to have to filter our words in case we say something racist - that actually makes us racist by not being as upfront with minorities as we would be with our own kind.

And as a minority, you don't need to have to double check statements white people make for racism.   I was testing out for a job last year, and it was my first job in a foreign city.   I asked a black guy where he was from, and he looked offended and told me he was from here (Berlin).   The whole race issue meant he was offended, and I was an unintentional racist.

Anyway, I guess what I am trying to say, is there is no 'us' and no 'them'.  There's only me and you.  And I'd like to live in a world where race, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, or the amount of toes you have play no part in how we interact with each other.",0,1325789287,null,0,false,0,c3e8ekr,t3_o3tsl,t1_c3e8ekr,t1_c3e5mxq,null,1428128849,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

While you are completely right in the fact that Loyalists were encouraged out onto the streets to create an expensive mess, as well as well as [at least 3 directly-connected murders](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/parade/develop.htm#10) over the head of a **parade** (let's keep in mind just how ridiculous this entire thing was). Brendan McKenna is of course an Éirígí stooge, who promoted himself to GRRC spokesman. Growing up in N. Ireland I'm sure you remember how communities worked under the thumb of parallel sectarianism.

Essentially, their point is that because events/facts change within the series and because the people who have been in charge of the televised version of Doctor Who don't ""believe"" in canon, there is no canon.

Canon isn't something needs to be established as a term in order to exist. It exists because there *is* a series.

Actually, the issue of facts/events changing within the series (which *really* doesn't seem to happen much at all) is easily covered through time being wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey.

Canon is what has happened so far that has been televised, according to what you've said.

So, everything else isn't ""canon,"" but it isn't technically ""fanon"" either, because it hasn't been denied as being canon.

Essentially, the people in charge of Doctor Who can't deny that canon exists. The only thing they're doing by saying ""There is no canon,"" is establishing that something *can't* be established as ""not-canon""/fanon.

Graduated 2007, so advice might be a bit out of date.

I can't really give an unbiased insight of Napier, but I would actually give the place a decent bit of consideration.  

The IT graduates are very well respected in the Industry, but the university isn't well respected in general.  The IT department has some truly excellent professors in it, in particular Bill Buchanan who is probably the best authority in Computer Security in the country, and he's a decent guy too.

**Pros:-**  Brilliant Graduate employment rate

Excellent Facilities.

Well respected Graduates in IT (I've employed some myself, and JP Morgan chase snapped me up 2 weeks after graduation)

Fantastic student placement schemes

Napier Girls are actually the fittest in the city.  (survey taken 2006)  :-D

**Cons:-** The University is shit for pretty much everything except IT, Nursing, Accounting and Business management.  Oh, and Timber studies.

The computing campus buildings are horrible 60s tower blocks (HW's are too).

The university has a course on complimentary therapies and reflexology. *cringes*

The Students union is more or less non existent.

Generally thought of as a jumped up Polytechnic.

Basically if you want a vocational degree that will get you a job, Napier's great.  The bells and whistles are lacking.

Seriously, join the whisk(e)y society if you go to Napier (and even if you don't) it's a great way to go round Scotland for cheap and there's a bit of an opportunity for nepotism once you're finished uni.

I look at it this way: Continuity is the question of how two given stories could conceivably fit together in a single narrative universe. This is the thing you think is inherent to all fiction.

Canonicity is the question of whether they are intended to fit together at all. This intent is, by its very nature, determined by some official body (usually the author, publisher, studio, etc.) With Doctor Who, the official body has categorically denied the existence of a canon.

What gets up my nose (and that of the author of the article I linked) is that a lot of people throw around the phrase ""But that's not canon,"" as some kind of disapproval. Since the official ruling body has denied a canon, the only canon is that of personal opinion, which means that your canon is just as valid as my canon, which means that the statement ""that's not canon"" in any kind of debate setting is logically null.

(A famous example: those dire warnings in the 1950's that automation would lead to mass unemployment.) As the derisive name suggests, it's an idea economists view with contempt, yet the fallacy makes a comeback whenever the economy is sluggish.

&gt;One of the best-known fallacies in economics....

If we were excluding paradoxical stuff, *Mawdryn Undead* would probably be on the chopping block, as would *The Five Doctors* and *The Two Doctors*.

Paradox isn't really a barrier for me. There's even a [recurring adversary in the books](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Faction_Paradox) whose entire *modus operandi* is based in paradox.

&gt; The only things that we should all have in common in our respective canons is what has been televised...

Spiffy! So Tom Baker's *Prime Computer* advertisements are in, as is *A Fix with the Sontarans* and *Curse of the Fatal Death*.

&gt; ...perhaps with the exception of the revelation that the Doctor is half-human as presented in the TV movie.

The Eighth Doctor novel *Unnatural History* presents a fairly plausible explanation for this: When a timelord regenerates, it's not just a reshuffling of his likeness and personality. It's a violent upheaval of his entire history, potentially shifting around key events in his past. The practical upshot of this is that, prior to his regeneration in the TV movie, he was never half-human. Then, during most of the rest of the TV movie, his timeline jumped a track, and he had *always been* half human.

Finally, at some point during or after the events of the Last Great Time War, his timeline lost the ""half human"" events, and key elements of the TV movie were [somewhat reconfigured](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Apocalypse_Element#Continuity).

So then we have Moffat come along and the Christmas episode is about saving the ship Amy and Rory are on, but also emotionally saving a grumpy old man.  

This Christmas, there was no one the Doctor was setting out to save.  The fact that Madge's husband WAS saved was an accidental by-product of the adventure (and due more to Madge than the Doctor).  This was a story about the Doctor paying a karmic debt by being there for someone who was there for him in his time of need, and trying to give her and her children something wonderful in their time of need.  Because the Doctor knows, when you take people out of their routine and beyond their comfort zone, they discover the something wonderful inside themselves.  This is what happened here, and the something wonderful they discovered within themselves (significantly in Madge's case), ended their time of need.

**I do not think that Diane Abbott is a racist.** I have no party loyalties, I vote on the issues. I don't see how her wealth and class status is relevant, but even accepting your implication that the power of the political elite has come somehow to transcend racial differences (I *do not* accept this, by the way. The most powerful people in this country are almost all white and institutional racism is as big a problem now as it was in the 1990s) the fact remains that, in this country, white people have traditionally been in a dominant and dominating position over other ethnicities in ways that go above and beyond the political. 

**I think that there is a clear difference between saying something that has racist overtones or even saying something explicity racist - and *being a racist*.** There are many degrees and values of racism. My cousin has recently come under the influence of what I suspect is a neo-Nazi. At Christmas he told me that Hitler wasn't so bad because ""at least he knocked off a few Jews."" My mother grew up in '60s/'70s East London with no formal education and occasionally moans about ""the bloody Muslims"" or ""the bloody Pakis."" Yes, that is racist and it makes my blood boil. But I am able to place my mother's comments in relation to where they are coming from - the culture and environment and influences under which they developed - and discern the difference between her feelings and those of my cousin.

**What Diane Abbott said was racist and she should apologise properly, not just for ""any offence caused."" At the same time, however, I can recognise that she tried to condense a rather complex thought that requires an unusually deep knowledge of history into a 140 character tweet.** This was stupid, but it reveals more an ignorance of the ways in which generalisations made over social media can seriously backfire, than it does her racial prejudices. 

I can also recognise that **Diane Abbott has spent most of her adult life campaigning not just for racial equality, but for class equality, national equality and equality of opportunity.** It would not make a lot of sense for her to deliberately make a racist statement, and especially not directly to the press and her followers on Twitter; one might therefore assume that she meant more than a superficial statement of racial aggression, and give her the benefit of the doubt.

**Finally, I think the reaction to her words is rather racist in itself.** The Conservatives should be ignored completely: their party is historically built on racism and the penalisation of immigrants, the working class and non-whites, so any opportunity to paint Labour in the same light is leapt upon with such fierce abandon that it disgusts me a little. But I can't help but wonder if much of the reaction by everybody else is down to some kind of triumphalism: ""Ah *ha*! The righteous black bitch isn't so perfect after all!"" I wonder if Diane Abbott was white, whether there would be quite such an uproar. In fact I'm sure I have read such comments from white people a few times... I wonder what it is about Diane Abbott, besides her prominence as a politician, that has sparked such an outrage?

I've bolded this because I'm pretty sure nobody will read it.

I don't think you can draw that conclusion without investigation. If you could wave a wand and eliminate unpaid overtime, it would increase the per employee cost for some companies.

* By increasing labor costs, you increase the prices of goods and services, reducing consumption.

* By increasing employment costs, you reduce hiring.

* By increasing labor costs, you make foreign-produced goods more competitive.

* Macroeconomically, if you increase labor costs without increasing productivity, it creates inflation as companies pass their increased costs onto the consumer. This inflation offsets any benefits that the economy as a whole sees from the increased wages.

Knock-on effects like these might outweigh the positives or they might not, but without a lot of study it's impossible to know for sure. My guess is that, in the short term at least, eliminating unpaid overtime would be very disruptive. However, this is not, as you say, 'unpaid work'.

We have African black British people,  we have West Indian black British people, we have mixed race black British people. We have muslim black British people, christian black British people, atheist black British people. The concept of the ""black community""  and ""black community leaders"" representing those people is a nonsense.  At the end of the day we have families and we have individuals and every one has a voice, and the black community is far too diverse to be labelled as a unit, they are british it doesnt matter what colour they are. Most British people dont give a shit about whether you are black or white or asian.

Its a very important point she's making. We shouldn't be dividing along racial lines. British people are British no matter what their skin tone and the idea that they are somewhat divorced from society as homogenous units and have their own community leaders perpetuates an ideology that  black british people are somehow different, its fake, its bullshit and its unhelpful frankly.

That session cookie doesn't enable the site to offer the service you requested (ie. viewing the page), therefore it's technically not allowed. There's no ""legitimate"" reason for them to put it there within the scope of how I just used their site; and it does track you unecessarily.

Do you really want to risk a half a million pound fine based on assuming that it's fine? I'd rather laws this stupid didn't exist given the potential harm they could cause - especially when someone powerful decides to start abusing it.

There's also another point that people don't WANT this behaviour on websites. People love cookies and websites does all this fancy stuff for them. If they didn't then browser vendors would be trying to win users by implementing more user-friendly cookie control. Why doesn't the browser have a little notice showing me when cookies are being written, or silently rejecting them by default, etc? Simply because not many people really care about that - and the few that do already have them turned off (but probably end up having to enable them per site on a very regular basis).

This should only ever be a browser feature, if anything - you're using software set up to let sites put what they like on your computer for later retrieval, you accept that by using a web browser configured in that way. If you don't like it, don't use it like that - there's no need for ridiculous laws like this.

As far as I am concerned if someone visits my website they are explicitly authorising me to use javascript, css, html, cookies, persistent storage, etc. etc. etc. As long as I don't do anything malicious, ie. to try and harm their computer - which is already covered through other laws of course - then there shouldn't be a problem.

Nice point. I don't think other doctors were constantly being reminded that they'll die soon.

BUT; as for *seeing* death, I'm pretty sure Ninth was far more affected and seen more deaths; he felt like a ""grizzled war veteran"" as many put it (""Just this once, Rose! Everybody lives!"" -- I didn't realise why he was so overjoyed until much later).

I'd also mention that, Ninth's regeneration was something where I felt like giving him a warm hug, especially when he screams ""Stay Back!"" at Rose. With Tenth, the same feeling evoked at a much earlier point when he was walking into the glass chamber. His final words? Not so much.

I guess it boils down to the line where many whovian redditors have split opinion, namely his final words -- those words feel meek when compared to the fantastic final words of Ninth.


&gt; What comes to mind particularly is that episode where he contests the ""fixed moments in time"" and saves that woman, only to see her kill herself.

Ah, Waters of Mars! The ""Time Lord Victorious"" was an wonderful imperfect side of Tenth I truly wanted to see more. His fight against regeneration was something RTD should have experimented more often (I'm not fond of the ""externalise to chopped-hand"" trick though).

Of course, we're both aware that ultimately, it boils down to preference ;) My first episodes being Blink and Time of Angels*, I epitomize as one who smiles in face of despair.

Despite that, the timelords bring him back as Derek Jacobi who then changes his name to professor Yana, he then manages to regenerate into John Simms and although he dies after being shot, that's not because he didn't have any regenerations left.

The FA knows well that to earn Dalglish' respect, you have to show him (and the club) a a little bit respect back.

If they were to be charged over their response, I think LFC should call for all the transcripts of the hearings to be made public. I believe Dalglish when he says everything is not in the report, and I think ultimately, until it's all on the table, the FA has something to hide.

I understand that this guy is in charge of an anti-racism organization, and wants to toot his own horn a little, but I would suggest that he at least starts by reading at the very least the executive summary of the report, that clearly states that neither Evra nor FA thinks, or have any reason to think, that Suarez is racist.

E3(2) states:
&gt;In the event of any breach of Rule E3(1) including a reference to any one or more of a person's ethnic origin, colour, race, nationality, faith, gender, sexual orientation or disability (an ""aggravating factor""), a Regulatory Commission shall consider the imposition of an increased sanction, taking into account the following entry points:

&gt;For a first offence, a sanction that is double that which the Regulatory 
Commission would have applied had the aggravating factor not been present. 

&gt;For a second offence, a sanction that is treble that which the Regulatory 
Commission would have applied had the aggravating factor not been present. 

&gt;Any further such offence(s) shall give rise to consideration of a permanent 
suspension. 
These entry points are intended to guide the Regulatory Commission and are 
not mandatory. 

&gt;The Regulatory Commission shall have the discretion to impose a sanction 
greater or less than the entry point, according to the aggravating or mitigating 
factors present in each case.

Then he claimed he didn't know negro meant black and not nigger in spanish (at the same time he's capable of talking to Suarez in Spanish phrases such as  ""Concha de tu herman"" (your sister's cunt),  ""Porque me diste un golpe"" (why did you kick me)"", ""Habla otra vez asi, te voy a dar una porrada"" (Say that again and I will punch you). So it's obvious that he's beyond ""restaurant-spanish"" level, he actually knows the language. It's not just unlikely that he doesn't know that negro means black, it's incredible.

I'd like to think charging people for this would put people off getting into that bad a state, and in fact may shame them into not doing it (we all know people who have done it, most know people to have done it more than once). Worst case scenario, they have less money to do it again next time.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor.

[Racism vs “racism”: why Diane Abbott was right](http://33revolutionsperminute.wordpress.com/2012/01/05/racism-vs-racism-why-diane-abbott-was-right/)

Text:
I can imagine a world in which Diane Abbott’s tweet that “White people love playing ‘divide and rule’ We should not play their game #tacticasoldascolonialism” would be racist. In this parallel universe Britain is dominated, politically and economically, by an unshakeable clique of black, working-class women and two black men have just been convicted, several years too late thanks to an institutionally racist black police force, of the murder of white teenager Stephen Lawrence. But in this world? Not really.

I don’t want to get into the ridiculous mob mechanics of Twitter outrage, which can be as bad on the left (witness pandagate) as it is on the right, except to note that **the “gotcha” strategy is a surefire way to ensure that no politician ever expresses themselves on social media except in the bloodlessly inoffensive style of Ed Milibot’s feed.** It seems we desperately want politicians to drop the platitudes and speak openly, except when they do, in which case they need to apologise and resign.

What this absurd flap demonstrates is the desperate longing of some privileged people to wear the rags of victimhood. Any whiff of black-on-white racism, like misandry and heterophobia, is an excuse for these delicate souls to downplay the dominant prejudice and argue that there is a level playing field of bigotry or, on the crazier fringes, that there is a “war” on white people/men/straight people/motorists, etc. Coming so soon after the Lawrence verdict, **Abbottgate is a nasty attempt to pretend that, hey, there’s racism on both sides now. A black man gets knifed to death by a white mob; a black MP writes a carelessly worded tweet about white people. It all evens out.**

Predictably Abbott has felt compelled to delete the tweet, though not the rest of the conversation which produced it. But **apart from the careless oversimplification — she should have said “white people in power” or “certain white people” — she was right.** In her initial qualified apology she clarified that she was referring to 19th century colonialism when, to take just one example, the Belgians colonising modern-day Rwanda strategically favoured the Tutsis over the Hutus and sowed the seeds of attempted genocide a century later. But you don’t need to go back that far. The US government’s efforts to disrupt the civil rights and Black Power movements are a textbook example of divide-and-rule. It is what dominant powers do. To read her tweet as an indictment of every single white person in the world requires either paranoia or malice. Most of all it means denying that power matters.

One common response was “Imagine if a white person had said something like this.” Well we’re back in the parallel universe. **“If this was a white MP saying black people like dividing white people they’d be out in five minutes,” claimed the opportunistically quick-on-his-feet Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi. It would also make no sense whatsoever, because such a thing doesn’t happen in the real world. The meaning of a comment depends on the power dynamic that underpins it.** If a black comedian makes a joke about white people, or a gay comedian about straight people, the audience knows that (a) they don’t mean everybody and (b) they are coming from an underdog position. They are punching up instead of down.

When I was a teenager getting into hip hop in the late 80s and early 90s, I came up against the Nation of Islam’s fruity theory (nothing to with mainstream Islamic teaching by the way) that white people are all “devils” created millennia ago by the renegade black eugenicist Yakub. It is, strictly speaking, racist in that it insisted on one race’s superiority over another. It’s also nuts, and if Diane Abbott came up with anything like that then she’d be looking for a new job. But it had zero bearing on the way America actually worked. It was a fantasy of empowerment embraced by some inner-city black people who had very little power in their everyday lives. It wasn’t cheering stuff for a lefty liberal like me but it bore no comparison to actual, systemic white-on-black racism. There was no equivalency.

That’s an extreme example. Abbott’s comment is both reasonable and historically accurate. One group that her oversimplification did ignore, unfortunately, is the large number of white working-class people who are at the bottom of the social heap and don’t have the power to divide and rule anything. But they’re not the people falling over themselves to express their outrage. Well-positioned commentators like Guido Fawkes and Toby Young are, and they are deliberately misinterpreting her comment in order to score political points, with the (hopefully inadvertent) by-product of fostering racial tension among those who will only encounter it second- or third-hand. Because **when a white person gets a chance to brand a black person racist, especially in the wake of the Lawrence verdict, they give themselves permission to pretend that privilege and power and the kind of deep-seated racism that ruins people’s lives are things that don’t exist anymore.**",0,1325817136,null,0,false,0,c3edap0,t3_o3tsl,t1_c3edap0,t1_c3ec6l3,null,1428131152,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

Bale has always had skill and touch to go with his raw pace and ape-like stamina. Walker is completely incapable of going past someone with anything other than pure athleticism, and his passing / touch are often reckless. 

Walker is also a hell of a good defender, which Bale was not. I think this has been his most admirable trait so far. It would be lunacy to switch him to RW. 

Lennon, while erratic with his delivery, always had good dribbling, close control, and decent vision / interplay with our other players. 

Walker is not a good dribbler, is always sort of precarious with his control, and doesn't have many ideas beyond attempting a cross (which he is inconsistent at best at).

Honestly Walker reminds me of a less technically accomplished version of Dani Alves: he's a player who seems to get more praise for his attacking than his defending, but really his defending is arguably more impressive. 

Their game is predicated on positioning, or more specifically their ability to constantly be an extra man in attack whilst also defending. It's not always so important what he does with the ball when he gets it; it's just that he's there as an option to be accounted for. And first and foremost, that requires superhuman athleticism. Even Alves isn't THAT technically brilliant.

true,slightlyKiwi,cyberman,Cyberperson,"According to Peel, Time Lords are 'infected' with nanodevices (similar to those seen in The Empty Child).  Up until their first regeneration, Time Lord bodies are similar to humans (evidence - in The Time Meddler, Stephen takes the Doctor's pulse, and makes no mention of a second heart).  Immediately after his first regeneration, when his companions ask him what happened, the Doctor replies ""it's a function of the Tardis.  I couldn't survive without it"".  Clearly, the Tardis is equipped to either give a Time Lord their initial 'dose' of nanobots, or to interface with them.  

The nanodevice theory provides a rational for the regeneration limit (the power cells of the devices are slightly drained for each regeneration), the Master's occasionally shown ability to cheat the limit (he recharges from another source), the Doctor's ability to reprogram the nanobots in The Doctor Dances (he's used to programming his own)...

Also, note that regenerations that happen on-screen almost always take place actually in the Tardis (1 to 2, 5 to 6, 6 to 7, 9 to 10, 10 to 11, DJ Master) or under the supervision of another Time Lord (2 to 3, 3 to 4), presumable to monitor the process and 'debug on the fly'.  Where this doesn't happen (4 to 5, 7 to 8) the Doctor has mental problems immediately afterwards.

Note that this theory is from the book ""The Gallifrey Chronicles"" and therefore may not be canon.  But it would explain the Master's interest in the Doctor's sliced-off hand (gives him the chance to 'break the encryption' and hack into the Doctor's nanobots).",0,1325819735,null,0,false,0,c3edqfm,t3_o32hy,t1_c3edqfm,t1_c3e76zf,null,1428131426,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I think the bill itself was made in march 2010 and put through less than a month later with barely any discussion on any of the three readings which, to be honest, is a rediculously small measure of time for any kind of legislation to go through.

In any case the whole thing is a farce of a charade of a thing because it was written to appease big business quickly and was written by people that were really only familiar with outdated business models of file distribution.

It wouldn't be a bad idea; after originally being against the idea of Catherine Tate as a companion, and then being proven wrong, this could work. (Pre-Who, I did not find Tate funny, and I do not find Hart funny.)

I think it's not that dissimilar from when RTD moved on from Rose and Martha to a non-sexualized companion for the Doctor. I think that Smith's Doctor in particular could do with a companion without sexual connotation. He has his relationship with River, and he's very Doctorishly-goofy in it, he doesn't need a companion to fill that role.

The degree has a strong emphasis on theory and mathematics. There are compulsory mathematics classes in the first two years but it helps to be comfortable with things like calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra. Take a look at the first year curriculum at Edinburgh and compare it to other universities: [Computation and Logic](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/inf1-cl), [Functional Programming](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/inf1/fp/), [Data Analysis](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/inf1-da), and [Object-oriented Programming](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/inf1-op). You won't spend much time learning how to write software (those programming classes in first year are the only instruction you are likely to receive in programming) but there are plenty of interesting classes in the honours years on topics like machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.

A degree in computer science from Edinburgh **might** get you a lot further than a degree with a similar title from either Napier or Heriot-Watt, depending on what you want from your career.

That was Wigan, now imagine the Old Trafford crowd.

I have no problem with him being banned if indeed he had done what Evra had said he had done. What I don't (and never will) agree with is the way the FA handled it.

They got two 'independent' experts on South American languages in, both happened to be white Englishmen and professors in a University in Manchester. I genuinely wouldn't be surprised if they were suggested by the prosecution.

Evra was allowed make his statements, then watch video replays of the incidents, then revise his statements, with the important points shown to him by the FA. It was because of this that Evra was able to use the arm pinch as a major point in making Suarez an 'unreliable witness'. When Suarez asked if he could see the videos too before making his final statements, he was told no.

Finally, with no evidence whatsoever, even though it was necessary for them to prove his guilt, they decided that on the 'balance of probability' he was guilty. With that decision, they banned him as if it was exactly as bad as Evra had originally claimed.

These points and more discussed here, the only major media outlet I've seen that hasn't already utterly branded Suarez a filthy racist pig.:

I love the trains. Getting around by train for me is a pleasure. But it does seem that the networks have evolved into a bureaucratic nightmare of regulations, as well as only the thinnest regard given for the passenger in terms of customer service and value for money. 

I think any system will eventually degrade in this way over time. I think any reform would have to be decisive and all encompassing. I think re-nationalisation perhaps with the scope to have some services provided by the private sector, but in a manner that is completely seamless from the passengers perspective.

One of the commenters has a very interesting story about some contract work his did for a rail provider and the needless expenses involved.

&gt; An associate of mine is a surveyor. On one of his jobs he was required to do a survey of a rail line. It was sunday, the line was closed and the location of the survey had perfect visibility in both directions.

&gt; Network rail required there to be eight men on watch. two in each direction at the survey point, with a further two in each direction farther down the line. The same line has uncontrolled crossings for the public.

&gt; I've worked on a rail crossing job where at any one time there were a maximum of four people working, with another twenty waiting for their turn to do a job. All being paid by the hour. This is due to the possession procedure operated by Network Rail, which makes the motorway possessions seem laissez faire.

&gt; Anyone who has worked on rail jobs will have similar tales of the staggering regulation overdrive on the jobs. Engineers who have worked on far more dangerous disciplines than rail (almost all other disciplines) are left shaking their heads in disbelief.

The reality is these ""differences"" you speak of that you want people to comment on are rarely commented on. Do I care if someone points out that they like cod and chips and I like curried goat? No. Would I be bothered if someone referenced the dark kink of my hair compared to their flaxen locks? Not likely. 

The differences *you* want to be able to ""comment"" on with impunity are altogether nothing to do with realistic cultural, physical or religious differences but flimsily thrown together opinions based on fear and ignorance. Exactly what ""difference"" would John Terry have been expressing had his alleged ""black cunt"" comment been true? Which ""observation"" would that fall under?

The reality is we don't live in a perfect world and humans are fallible. We have bizarre quirks and in built prejudices that if allowed to come to the fore work against a decently run and successful society.

I take it a right wing fellow such as yourself has no love nor admiration for sub Saharan Africa. Lets call it what it is...a land that's in a fucking mess. But do you know why? Because the day to day average citizen actually has *more* freedom of expression than you do. They can exercise and allow to flourish all the hate, resentment and ignorant superstitiously driven opinion of their fellow man without much comeback on the other end. I'm not saying Britain would descend into the dark ages, but I'm not sure you're fully aware of what kind of society you're asking for when you say we abandon social restraint for free expression of our most base and primitive internal instincts.

At the risk of sounding like an arsehole, I'm just going to say this. I'm sure I'm more intelligent than you. Of course there's no way to prove it one way or the other, but I'm simply going on the evidence in front of me and our brief encounters previously. You just don't strike me as a very thoughtful person or one who can cogently express their inner thoughts in a manner that others can understand. Despite that, I'm sure you still believe you're a *better* version of a human being than I am. Now that's your prerogative, but in the real World that sort of thinking has real consequences. If for example you found yourself in the position of recruitment for a company, your best efforts would not be able to stop you exercising those opinions and hiring someone more like you rather than someone who's recruitment would have been a boon for the organisation who may be from another part of the World. What guys like you hate is that processes and checks have been put in place to mitigate against such things.

Doing Software Engineering over Computer Science at Edinburgh simply means that you're required to take the 3 software engineering courses that exist: Software Testing (3rd year), Software Engineering with Objects and Components (3rd year), and the 4th year equivalent of SEOC, forgot its name for the moment. That's the only real difference, aside from the name of your degree.

Any given course at Edinburgh may require you to do a bit of programming for its assignments, and you're expected to be able to learn the required programming language quickly. The aim of the first year programming courses is to introduce you to enough concepts that you should be able to adapt to any given programming language. Programming languages I used in various courses at Edinburgh include: Java, C, C++, Python, Ruby, Prolog, Haskell (this one is the first language you're taught in first year), Scala, Matlab...

If you hate walls of text, I can tell you that most of the courses I picked in 4th year required a few essays for their coursework assignments, but it's not too bad.

To reiterate what votadini_ said, a CS degree at Edinburgh is supposed to be more flexible than the other IT-related degrees provided in this city.

I wholeheartedly agree with this, but would add a few wee riders onto it, especially paying attention to the ""depending what you want from your career"" part.  UoE pisses over every other university in Scotland as far as post grad research (maybe with closer competition from Glasgow and St Andrews than the rest), so if you're wanting to be an academic then UoE will get you FAR. (Just by the by, I seem to remember that BTEC qualifications weren't accepted by UoE)
As far as non academic careers are concerned, a degree is just a means to getting an interview.  It's a tickbox, and basically getting hired depends on you as a person and how good your skills are.  

Once you're hired, you're treated the same no matter what uni you went to.

What I've found is that UoE students that I've interviewed and a few I've hired, is that they can tell you the best way of tackling the travelling salesman problem, but would take 3 hours to write the algorithm, googling all the while as they went and then forgeting error handling..

I had a HW student that, with an MSc in software engineering, specialising in Java, forgot how to write a ""Main"" method signature during the test we set at interview.  She didn't catch on for 20 minutes, then blamed eclipse (despite the massive red line).

I had a Napier Student that wrote functional code, but whenever something went wrong, blamed the compiler and refused to use any existing libraries.  

The moral of the story is that no matter what University you go to, you get your degree and then you go out into the big wide world and learn how to *actually* do your job.

:-D

Edinburgh is a brilliant city to study in.  You'll have a great 4 years no matter what University you pick.

The cause of the regeneration would have been the Doctor's exposure to the Time Vortex in his efforts to destroy the Cybermen (the same cause that triggered the later Ninth to Tenth Doctor regeneration in Parting of the Ways). Destrii would have witnessed the regeneration and would have continued to travel with the Ninth Doctor in a proposed Year One arc. When Davies vetoed the Year One arc and indicated the Ninth Doctor could only be shown travelling with Rose Tyler, Hickman and writer Scott Gray eventually decided not to depict the regeneration as they would have been unable to give Destrii a proper departure. The Panini collection includes the original script for the regeneration sequence, as well as never before published art showing the regeneration itself.

Stop complaining about rain puddles. You live in Norn Iron, deal with it.

Shopping
Dont blame Tesco for only having out of date turkeys left, aim that query at Moy Park and O Kanes who where recently bought over by a Brazilian Poultry company who made a massive fuck up on the dates of Turkeys. Also new legislation means Turkeys can no longer be killed in July and frozen like they used to, they have to be killed at the start of december.

Changes in the law mean, I can be held personally responsible if an 18yr old buys alcohol, goes around the back of our store, gives it to a 16yr old and they get detained by police and then pinpoint me as the person who legally sold it to the 18yr old who then supplied it.

What *is* an issue is the acceptance that homophobia is well and good, and even encouraged! This leads to a slippery slope of acceptance of any number of feelings that culminate in the accepting of violence against gays. The illegality of the assault or murder of gay people doesn't factor in when the very people charged with upholding the law also share the same abhorrent views.

Now in the UK, for all we know every copper *hates* black people...but we live in a society where such feelings are frowned upon. Doesn't matter if the feeling is false as people like culture and brian think, and artificially imposed by some corrupt elite, the fact is one bigot doesn't really know that the other bigot shares his views and vice versa. They both stay on their best behaviour for fear the other would frown on their views. Taking it out of Africa you only have to look to the US 50 years ago for what happens when hatred of one group is accepted by a seemingly civilised society as OK. Lynchings happened with impunity despite the illegality of murder because the people who would prosecute were complicit.

Is it perfect? A society basically tricked into being decent to each other? No. But is it to that societies mutual benefit, that murder and violence against anyone will be punished no matter what? Yes.

Tackling 'benefit fraud' in this country invariably ends up with the poor losing out, at a point where there's 2.6 million young people unemployed, not in education or training, I don't think it's a good idea to start messing with a system that already has incredibly long wait times. I work for a charity that provides support to young ex-offenders in Yorkshire and we're looking at wait times of 3-4 weeks before people can get their JSA, never mind child or disability allowances. Don't even get me started on housing. You can apply for a crisis loan only so many times before you're sent away and after that there is literally nothing for these people. It would be so incredibly dangerous to start looking at benefit reform now I'd genuinely worry for the future of the poor in this country if any serious program was to be introduced. Not to mention the cost of reform would probably outweigh any benefit gained (and a more cynical man might suggest it would be done only to those who believe everything they read in the daily mail) Just look at the digitalisation of the NHS farce.

On the topic of min. wage JSA is less yeah but you are faced with going through a ridiculous amount of hassle for any kind of job through the job centres at the moment, if you're entitled to any other kind of benefit eg. if you have children, then its more likely that being on benefits works out better for you.

Walks into the store, to the place to collect the parcels, there is a queue.  Three or four guys are in the queue.  One of them says that they've been there 25mins.

She goes up to the first employee she can find and asks why there is no-one at the desk, the girl gruffly says 'i already called for someone so i did'  my wife asks her to call again, another tannoy announcement is made...

5 minutes pass and nothing has happened.

She asks the girl again to ask and the girl gets a bit stroppy, so my wife asks for the manager.

Manager comes, my wife informs the manager that they have been in the queue for quite a while and no-one is serving can he get someone, the girl has made two announcements and no-one has come along... at this stage the girl interrupts with 'I called him 4 or 5 times, so i did' which only serves to re-inforce the point.

so my wife gives the manager a hard time, and he goes looking for the person, turns out the guy who was supposed to be doing the desk had just gone off home without telling anyone... his manager hadnt noticed despite all these announcements.

Eventually (she was there 30mins, unable to stand much more due to pregnancy) someone comes along, the people at the front who were quite old and retired had been standing idly for over an hour.. no kicking up a fuss, just grimly accepting such sloppy service.

true,TheJackpot,,Belfast,"Yes, this is pretty similar to what they did to my mum.  She has a bad back and can't stand or walk for long periods of time without aid of a walking stick.
    
This particular event we were only supposed to be in and out.  It wasn't supposed to be a long trip, mum was just looking to exchange for some of those Christmas voucher thingys they were doing that year and pick up a coat for my brother, so mum didn't bring her walking stick in with her.

So we go over to the marked out desk for the coupon exchange thing, and stand there for about 15 minutes, a couple other people turn up and wait around too, until I notice a sign that wasn't that obvious saying ""go to Customer service desk for coupons.""  Then we head over to the customer service desk and I think at this point we managed to get the coupons, but we will be returning to this area later.

We continue on with the journey, picking out a coat and a couple of other items, this process only taking about 5/10 minutes of the evening.  We've already been in Tesco for about 30 to 40 minutes longer than really necessary by this point and mum is getting irritable.  This is the point we go to pay for the items at the checkout, and all seems to be going well, until mums checking her receipt as we're walking away and she realises the kid at the till fucked up with the coupons and shortchanged her by about £50.

So we return to the fabled Customer Service desk and actually end up standing around for another 30 minutes because the dipshit working the desk was chatting to her fucking friend.  Mum decides to go over to the woman at the scratch card desk instead because she looks far more likely to help us at this point.  As soon as we walk away from customer service the stupid bitch stops talking to her friend and serves the person that was standing behind us.  Talking to the woman on the scratch card desk was more fruitful, though, sorted the problem out and gave mum the £50 in cash to make up for the cock-up.  Mum is pretty pleased by this result and remembers the digital camera she saw on offer and because she now has £50 she didn't have before, decides she can afford it.

Now, despite how much we both wanted to get out of there at this point, we go down to pick up the camera because *really*, how long could it take?

Too fucking long, is the answer.
This basically had us up and down the store like fucking yo-yos, because there was no one at the electronics desk where you're supposed to pay for things like this, and everyone kept sending us back there, where we waited for a further 15 minutes.  This is basically where mum started to lose it, and she went behind the counter at electronics, which was unmanned, and started *banging* on the door to the store room, really fucking loud.  This clearly startled the nearby Tesco employee who was located in the next aisle over ""helping other customers"" (I suspect she was having a good ol' rummage in her nose for some gold, either way, this is no real excuse during the Christmas season when such a large store should have the brains to put extra staff on a section like electronics)

But we *finally* had someone to scan the item and let us get the fuck out of there.  Or, so we thought...
There was *another* problem.
The camera was fucking out of stock.
It was out in a big display with about 50-100 other boxes of the *same* camera, and no out of stock notice.

But it was gone.  None left.

So we left.

Never to return.

I'll probably never forget this incident, for as long as I live.  Nowadays we just head down to Sainsbury's in the Holywood Exchange.  Much better customer service, and I often go to pick up some alcohol on Saturday evenings, the fella that's normally on self serve remembers my face, so I don't even have to pull out my ID anymore.

This is why this article is nonsense. *If* the increase meant that people started to drive *another* 10mph over the speed limit then it might have a point. But this change in the law wouldn't even mean an average increase in speed of 10mph on the motorways *anyway*.

The thing is that the 80mph law comes along with strict enforcement of that speed limit, so we're not going to suddenly see everyone driving at 90mph at all. It's a completely false conclusion and only takes half of the law into account.

All it really means is business as usual for a lot of people. Others, who are a stickler for the law (like you :P), will be able to drive at 80 mph too without feeling guilty or getting yelled at by their mum in the passenger seat for going too fast :)

How somebody can sensibly say the MOT has no effect on the general standards of cars on the road is beyond me. Yes a car can fall apart straight off the ramp. Yes a car could rust into pieces within 3 years. Most do not and that is why the system has value. Most cars are not doing 200k miles in 2 years.

You are confusing turnover with profit. In my first year as a sole trader selling refurbished laptops I had a turnover of just over £50k. I made a trading LOSS of £250.

Turnover is merely the money that passed through the till. Without knowing the accounts payable you cannot know if the company made £299,999.99 or made a loss. ",0,1325875531,null,0,false,0,c3ekks0,t3_o3saj,t1_c3ekks0,t1_c3e683m,null,1428134651,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
