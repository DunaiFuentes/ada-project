true,cucumbermelee,null,null,"Nah man, come on. £35mill is an insane amount of money. We could have gotten Cavani, we could have gotten Llorente, Huntelaar, Falcao (at the time) with that type of money. £35mill is not spent on a prospect, I'm sorry. That's not how football works. He was never going to be worth that much, even if he got 20 goals a season it wouldn't've been justified for that price. For that much money you're looking at superstars. Look up the record transfer fees and see the other players that have flopped having cost that much or more. And you get people like Juan Veron who was world class everywhere but at Utd. Torres for £50mill, he was world class at LFC. The best example is probably Andriy Shevchenko. He was m favourite non-LFC player at the time and I was gutted to see him go to Chel$ki as I thought he'd be a hit. He flopped something serial. Didier Drogba cost £24mill and he was proven. I realise English players carry a larger fee because of their inflated evaluation by the media etc but Andy Carroll only had half a good season in the EPL. Makes NO sense at all to spend that much money on him. We wasted most of the Torres money when in fact we should have grit our teeth and both someone else. I have no qualms in spending that much money on a proven player but he flops. Spending that much money on a player who has since then proved he isn't worth more than £15mill is idiotic and I'm glad heads rolled for that stupid decision. I'm a Carroll fan, I love KK as well. Kenny will always be a legend at Liverpool. 

As for your last paragraph, I don't even know where that's coming from. I was using those players to show you what actual transfer fees are meant to be. Not this BS. And United, Madrid and Barca are the three biggest clubs in the world. Like it or not. They have great history. A transfer to them does not mean you don't have a nobel heart so please kindly hang your head in shame for that comment as it has no bearing to either your argument or my response. 

How long have you been watching football? Be honest. I'm not going to one of those dickheads that slate new fans. We all started one day. Whether it was 20 years ago or 2 days ago, everyone had that day. There's nothing wrong with new fans but please look at that transfer relative to the transfers of strikers in the transfer windows just prior and since. And you will realise what a JOKE it was so waste so much money. If we had got him for £15 million, that would have been a good deal and he would have done better.

He has now gone onto a team where they play exactly his style. And has 1 goal in 8 starts. What were they thinking paying £35mill. And he was not England's hottest prospect at that time, he was a player that scored 11 goals in his first half season. There was not a massive furore over him, he was just the flavour of the month. Like Cissé last year and Benteke this year. It happens all the time in football, a player has a great season and fades away. AC was always going to be that. Aside from a great shot, he offers little else. His close play is decent but he's slow, sluggish and for a man his size he's not that great with his head. 

AC would have happily stayed at Newcastle so don't tell me he wanted to come. The Newcastle board couldn't believe their luck with that much money and sold him, they had nothing to lose and invested that money very wisely. I'm sorry mate, you're arguing an ultimately facile point.

I hope I didn't come across as a dick here because I don't mean to be. You just cannot defend that fee. I'm a massive Liverpool fan, no matter what. But I'm also a football fan and I follow la Liga and the Bundesliga. That fee is actually a joke.

Word to the wise dipshit, The more you actually understand a problem the more complex and fragile you understand the issues to be, and teh more effort required to explain (especially to an audience such as you).

I could at length detail the concept of perceived value and its effect on an economic model (such as the UK), in order to instigate change, together with the associated game theory and its implications/results to certain issues

But as predicted, (and rightly so it would seem), it would clearly be a waste of effort , as your complete lack of even basic comprehension is pretty evident. 

As for grammar etc, this may come as a shock but Reddit isnt a formal document or piece of work, and when its my time (and to this audience) i will take any short cut i wish and that inlcudes hastily writing and not bothering with punctuation/spelling/structure.

Edit: One of the cases I remember was a girl who made rape allegations about a footballer. The police sold her information to the tabloids, and the tabloids went to the houses of all of her relatives, shouting through the letterbox, asking questions about the rape. They then threatened her, saying that she should 'get her side of the story across', otherwise they coudn't guarantee coverage would be positive.

As I say, the likelihood that police leaks like that are going to be followed up is very small. If the policeman and the journalist are both careful, it's almost impossible to prevent or to investigate, given journalist source protection, and that's assuming the police are interesting in locking up their colleagues. Would the tabloid's behaviour towards her constitute severe enough harrassment to be prosecuted? I'm not sure it would. As for her ability to bite back at a snide, vindictive news report, is she really going to spend tens of thousands of pounds paying for a libel trial, and risk paying for the paper's exorbitant lawyers if she loses, and thus risk losing all of her assets, and having her credit rating destroyed? I don't think so. Even so, there are plenty of ways coverage can be negative or destructive without being libellous.

true,farheezy_yo,null,null,"I agree that 35mil could have been spent (much) better elsewhere. But you have to look at the context. Torres turned in a transfer request, and Chelsea was going to get him, just a question of cost. With it being towards the end of the Winter transfer market, we had little time to really come up with a replacement. 

Surely the likes of Aguero, Cavani, et al would be superior, but just because we had cash to throw around doesn't mean teams were gladly selling superstars. I mean, the only reason we sold Torres was because that little prick handed in a request and forced our hand. If I'm Cavani or Aguero or one of the other high end players, I wouldn't have wanted to go LFC, a team that is at, best in the process of steering the ship in teh right direction and at worst, a storied club on a slow and steady decline towards mediocrity. 

You can't honestly say that any player would rather play for LFC right now than MCFC. Or even the past two years. City have been on the up and up for a while now, and Liverpool have been sliding since the end of 2008.

Now one would argue that the 35mil could have gone elsewhere, but we were in quite a bind. We had lost our best striker for a mammoth fee, and had to replace him quickly. You can't convince world class players that you're middle of the table club is worth joining, even if you managed to convince their teams to sell them to you.

Again, Carroll was amongst the best young english strikers in the game at the time of his purchase. That doesn't mean anything in terms of his skill, but it does put his value over the top. English players are always a premium in the EPL, especially the rising prospects. And we all know how fairly strikers are valued.

Again, I'm not saying the 35mil is justified, it just didn't matter to LFC how much he'd cost, because it hinged on Chelsea speanding 15mil more than that amount for Torres. If Newcastle had demanded 40mil for Carroll, then we would have demanded 55mil for Torres. 

It's not like Liverpool went out and said ""This Andy Carroll fella is going to be legendary, better than the likes of any player available right now. We should get him at all costs.""

The truth is Torres was no true Red, and forced his exit. The club had already been accused of having no spending power to have any hope of remaining with the elites in the EPL, and so the ownership was forced to do something. Signing Suarez wasn't going to be enough if Torres forced his own way out. 

Of course all of this could be avoided if Carroll would just come back from his loan and start scowing 25 goals a year regularly for the next 10 seasons or so.

I think I'll go with Sahin, Suso and Gerrard. This way, it's very attacking-minded and can perhaps destroy Southampton within the first half. Later, Shelvey can come on for Suso and push the line up further to press them. I'd like to see this lineup for a change, just to experiment and see what we can do.

-Wisdom-Skrtel-Agger-Johnson (Back line)

-------------N/A------------- Defensive Midfielder/Holding role)

--------Sahin-----Suso------- (Central area, two CMs)

-------------Gerrard---------- (Attacking midfielder)

--Sterling--------------Enrique (Wingers)

-------------Suarez----------- (Main striker, can drop back if necessary (since Suarez seems to like dropping back)

It's a bit risky not to have anyone playing the defensive midfielder, but Agger likes to go up and he can.

&gt; They give independence.

Not for children. There's many who can afford or aren't even allowed to drive—only 50% of the UK have drivers licenses. Many are too young, too old, too frightful, too disabled. Once you hit 60-65 you become dependent on other drivers and its one of the major reasons you get a silo effect. Maybe you mean dependence on oil. Some kids also become dependent on inhalers, and 20k per year become dependent on long term medical treatment including wheelchairs and prosthetics. 

&gt; Cycling is ok for short journeys but its horrible in bad weather arriving miserable and covered in mud.

Mud? I know cycling infrastructure is bad but they aren't all fields. Have you tried mud guards? Also the money spent on the car could provide for sheltered cycleways.

&gt; I think we should go the other way and spend major money to improve roads, add more parking, intelligent traffic management. We should also take advantage of technology and have more people work from home or work flexible hours.

You can spend all the money you want improving roads but you can't improve on the human component—drink drivers, mobile phone usage, road rage, pollution. Just think if all the selfish drivers and politicians refocused all the resources spent on taxes, collection, road injuries, road deaths, car parking, traffic police, insurance, 20k death machines, wars for oil, petrol, MOTs, etc, etc, etc, we could have such amazing mass public transportation with very high safety levels. The bonus would be free time. It's absurd that hundred people do the job of one, or none.

If you moved schools, shops, work and the other good things in life closer to people then the car becomes obsolete. The car is one of the main reasons that urban planners provide antisocial designs.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"Okay, everyone posting after me get ready to make a negative prediction because, after winning two games that (based on form) we should have lost, I'm ready to start making positive predictions again!

Huddersfield are drifting into a bad spell of form, while Leeds are starting to really pick up. A cynic would say that it's time for a reversal of fortune for both clubs, but Leeds really seem to have a lot of momentum behind them now and I don't see it stopping yet. I think that an astute prediction would probably be a draw, which would turn this into a winning run, but I'm actually going to predict a **2-1 win**.

I don't see us keeping a clean sheet - we seldom do against Huddersfield. I wouldn't be surprised if Clayton scored against us, actually, as he seems quite determined to show Warnock what he's been missing. From what I've heard, Clayton seems to have really come of age at Huddersfield and started running the show - which is probably what he would have done at Leeds, if he had a proper partner in midfield.

On the bright side, Huddersfield have midfield hardman Keith Southern suspended, while their young wizkid, Oliver Norwood, has been out of form for a while. On the down side, they seem to have a good deal of pace in their team, not least with Beckford involved. He completely let us off the hook against Leicester, as he seemed more interested in the crowd than the game, but he and Grayson have a good connection and I don't think that he'll lose focus this time around. Hopefully Leeds will be aware of Beckford's weakness: getting poked, prodded and stepped on; most of all generally given no space. Tate should be particularly good at that.

I'll offer no line-up prediction this time, though, as I'm certain that he'll leave it unchanged if possible - and who can blame him? The only change I could possibly recommend is McCormack in for Diouf, but the arrival of Thomas has given Diouf more space and a new lease of life, so he might as well be left in the side.",0,1354305272,null,0,false,0,c799dpu,t3_142den,t1_c799dpu,t3_142den,null,1430543814,3,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,3

Now, I understand where the author is coming from: This **over** prioritisation of Welsh does get annoying - those examples that he used: the children going to the loo etc, are stupid and the teachers/school governors should be held accountable... not the language. :/ 

But... his point about 'Anti-English'... in some cases he's correct but I think that mainly it's just 'Pro-Welsh.' That yes, our country has our own language and it would be a horrible day when it 'dies.' 

Am I making sense here? :/

Laimë ye maptahrávë.
I decided to use (of many options) the form of 'that' that applies to a person, or in this case an entity...little touches like that make me happy when I figure them out. 

So final is:

With him saying he'd like to come back to London, and Rafa only being signed til the end of the season, I'd say it's a possibility. But only if Mourinho does actually leave Madrid. 

This is where my theory took a completely fantasy turn though. Let's say Mou did come back. What with all the talk of Ronaldo being sad, and him leaving, what if he decided to leave? Only to be reunited with his manager Mou at the Bridge.

Allen is off form and probably just needs a rest after playing 2-3 games per week forever, and Gerrard has been playing almost as much as Allen.  They could use a bit of tiem to rest and refresh, while Sahin and Shelvey should be able to compete very well with the Soton midfield.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"The first 5 on this list (Moutinho, Willian, Dzagoev, Pjanic, Martin) are either too expensive, overrated, unwilling to join us, or some combination of the 3. 

Moutinho is the ideal player for us, but I think it's pretty obvious our chances have gone down since we missed out. 

Willian is an exciting player but again, he plays for a very wealthy club which has an excellent chance of playing in the CL knockout stages. They have no incentive to sell him whatsoever. It allegedly will take in the ballpark of 30m to buy this player, which is madness. 

Dzagoev is probably realistic but I don't think I'm alone in being unconvinced by him. I think his EURO 2012 was good but a bit overstated, and I'm not sure he's the type of player we need. 

Pjanic again is probably realistic but he's more or less said he doesn't want to join Spurs.

Martin just moved recently and I think he likes it in France. Awesome little player though.

Now here's where I get pissed off at the author of this. This Clasie = Tom Carroll comparison makes me want to choke someone. I'm a big fan of little Tom, but Clasie absolutely dwarfs him in ability. Jordy has already been capped by senior Holland, and Carroll can't even get into the England U21s. 

I will bang this drum as hard as I did Dembele: Clasie is a player we should be signing. He will be affordable if we move quickly, he is young, and he is exactly the type of midfielder we need. A Joe Allen who can actually pass the ball forward. [He's like Scott Parker and Luka Modric's forbidden lovechild.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhX_OfBheQ0) 

There's just one problem: Juve are apparently interested in him as well :(. 

Edit: Scratch that, there are two problems. [He has this tattoo on his arm](http://www.afca.nl/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/media_xll_1143305.jpg). Such idiocy is almost a deal-breaker.

I like it. It's a good start. But that's the thing, is that it looks like just a base. If you're trying to make a full-on Cortex, this would be a good first layer, but as far as ""realism"" goes, it's not enough. 

Again, what you have isn't bad, not at all, it just needs more. It also depends on which vortex you're going for. If you're wanting more of a Series 1-4 feel, then start adding more layers of thin, bright energy-looking strands. Just start piling them up and eventually you'll get something like the Eccelston-Tennant years. 

If you're wanting something more like we see with Smith, then go online and start looking for free Photoshop brush tools, and find some high-res ones for clouds, smoke, etc. also look for some good lightning ones as well. Same as before, just start layering them on top of each other, bringing the Opacity of each layer to somewhere around or below 50% so that they don't get too muddled either.

Yes, in the case of murder, you loose your child. They die, and you have to live with that loss, and it is ** truly** terrible.

But in the case of paedophilia - whilst you child may be returned to you - they will be forever changed as a person. Although they will hopefully go on to live their life as best they can, their entire life will be affected by what happened to them as a child.

true,KopiteKing13,lfcflame,,"I don't believe we are in decline right now.  I feel as though rock bottom came on transfer deadline day back on August 31.  We had just suffered an FA Cup final defeat after our worst season in terms of League position for almost 2 decades and sacking a manager who had a magnificent history with the club.  Then when it comes to securing the players we need to challenge for a European place, we get rid of one of our few remaining forwards and replace him with absolutely no one.

I know we have not picked up as many points as any of us on /r/LiverpoolFC would have hoped for, but I think most of us would agree that the majority of our performances have been very promising.  I don't think we are still in decline, but rather I think we are just starting to come upwards out of our trough.  There is still a LONG way to go however.  We have sprinkled the team with a much needed injection of youth, and whilst they definitely aren't close to being the finished product yet, they are showing great promise.  We have dropped some careless points and at times played with a worrying sense of naivete, but our passing has greatly improved, we keep possession of the ball far better than we have done in the recent past and I feel its only a matter of time before we turn some of those losses into draws and draws into wins.

But to answer your original question, we have been in decline for a variety of reasons stretching all the way back to Hicks and Gillette.  The lies and the debt severely damaged us, making it impossible to secure the one or two players we needed to win the League.  Their games and stunts made our managers relationship with them untenable, so Benitez, the best manager we've had (in my lifetime at least), left.  Our next manager could only afford to sign sub-par players on free transfers, and the manager following him (and Comolli) signed other sub-par players for astronomical prices.

If Benitez had survived until FSG arrived, or if Dalglish hadn't wasted the millions and millions of pounds he was given on mediocrity, we would be challenging for the CL places at the very least.

We have been pushed back by several years, I'd say at least 10 or 12.  I fear that with other teams since becoming beneficiaries of the money of bored multibillionaires, and other teams such as yours setting themselves up incredibly well financially, it may be quite some time before Liverpool can even hope for a reentrance to the CL, but I will definitely keep the faith and hope that day comes sooner rather than later.",0,1354319178,null,0,false,0,c79d4jy,t3_141mws,t1_c79d4jy,t3_141mws,null,1430545578,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1
