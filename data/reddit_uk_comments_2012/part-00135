Then, If you finish all of the current show, you can go on Netflix and watch the classic Who episodes they have.  Also, try to find the 1996 Eighth Doctor movie.  I know, it sucks for the most part, but McGann did an amazing job.

true,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,"&gt;I am not saying everyone is to be an engineer or programmer, just that they should train and educate themselves to be the best in whatever field it is that interests them.

Why? Lots of kids are interested in Media etc. but we already have a crapton of unemployed media, film and english students etc. who hoped to go into Film or journalism finding out that's not how it works.

My great-grandfather worked as a farm labourer, I doubt when he was younger he felt that was all he wanted to do with his life, but in reality you don't get to do what you want, you get to do what you can, what is available. Trying to pretend this isn't the case just leads to the current problems we have with too many graduates in non-viable subjects.

Note that in some areas like Engineering (which you use for your example) there is legitimate demand. But a quick glance at what the most popular uni courses are will show you that most people want to study subjects which aren't economically viable.

So given that we can't force everyone to pursue a viable career (and given their lack of interest it wouldn't work anyway) we have a problem. I don't see why we should just educate people for non-existent jobs in already saturated sectors just to make people feel better and massage the unemployment figures.",0,1349205935,null,0,false,0,c6gloy8,t3_10tpsz,t1_c6gloy8,t1_c6gleih,null,1430046224,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

do what you can, which means you need to learn a skill, and build from there. If there is no availabilty/demand then create it.

I think that ability is in most people when they realise that with some calculated risk taking it is possible to get somewhere.

People didn't know they needed a lightbulb until it was invented.. Your great-grandfather maybe could have saved up to become a small holder and sell his produce and build from there. 

I am sorry but it all sounds just a little bit too defeatist, I think one needs to be a little bit more proactive than just throwing hands in the air and asserting there are no jobs. There are plenty of other options open to people who have , for example, English degrees, there is a whole world out there desperate to learn English to a good level as it is now THE international language. If said graduates actually took some risks maybe they would find a position that could be interesting for them 

I dunno it all sounds very defeatist.

I'd recommend starting with the strips and going from there to the others, also it can be helpful to read the writing introducing the comic...most make sense without it but some had me scratching my head!!

* Transform business engagement in schools, involving them in the design of vocational qualifications while ensuring anyone studying for a Tech Bacc successfully complete a programme of work experience
* Enable young people to go into apprenticeships when they leave education at 18 with ""Tech Baccs"". Businesses would have control over government funding of £1bn to spend on apprenticeships as well as more say in setting the standards for qualifications.

Essentially, what has happened is that British business, facing global competition, has retreated from taking people on and training them up for a job. In the short term, this increases profitability, but in the long term the skills won't be available to continue operating. The public sector has moved into this gap, but it has maintained its traditional educational philosophy of 'learning for its own sake', which means precisely that people either study topics which are abstract, and of no direct vocational relevance, or they study for skills which are not in demand.

&gt;Friendly enough staff and a nice selection of things which you put into a tiny bowl and take to a chef with a giant flat hot plate. Your bowlful will then be fried on said big hot plate, which you then take back to your table.

&gt;After two or three trips to the food counter, over to the frying plate area, and then back, you start to lag a bit. The bowls hold about as much food as a big teacup, and even though we were there early evening, with only about 10 other diners in the place, the queues got longer and longer. We had about three little bowlfuls and gave up.

&gt;Not as much all you can eat as all you can queue! 

And this snippet from a much longer review:

&gt; Due to the size of the bowls we only spent a few minutes sitting down eating before we had to make the long walk to the hot plate again. Just to set the scene and to give you an idea of the size of the Q (which was simply not acceptable) a bizarre feeling of camaraderie broke out with the people in the Q. People started to joke with each other and introduce them selves as we waited. We made fun of each others bowl sizes as we joined in our universal hatred of the teenagers who would eventually zap our food on the miniscule hotplate.

And then there is this one:

Well - I think a picture is emerging here.

He believes wholeheartedly in a peaceful society through order.  Trusts the system to dispense justice, and works *with* rightful authorities far moreso than he works against them.  Does what he can to protect the innocent and inspire others to follow in his footsteps because he always has to have a plan.  Especially a plan for when he can no longer do the job he's appointed himself to do.

The Doctor does not plan.  He is a creature of total spontaneity and whimsy who throws caution to the wind, and trusts in the inherent goodness of people and their ability to manage themselves in his absence.  Never really acknowledges any authority, whether rightful or not.  Leaves a lot to chance as his travels are basically random.  Despises tedium, and lives his life as if he's never really in control of anything.  But he still does the right thing whenever and wherever he ends up, because he's ultimately a good and noble man.

Batman is basically the definition of Lawful Good.  The Doctor is utterly Chaotic Good, based on my understanding of the last three of them anyway.  Same goals in the long run (save and protect as many people as they can in the time they have).

true,NonSequiturEdit,hartnell,Hartnell,"My pet theory about the tombstone and why the Doctor knows it's real and not just a ""decoy"" like his subterfuge at Lake Silencio:  
  
As a Time Lord, the Doctor can intuitively sense time streams.  He looked at that tombstone and he *knew* that the Ponds were buried there.  That was the end point of their timelines.  
  
Now why can't he visit them at a later point?  Because any temporal interference along *any vector* leading back to the paradox in New York 1938 would shatter the already-weakened continuum, like tapping on a cracked piece of glass.  
  
Even if he wanted to go back and get the Ponds and take them on adventures with the intention of returning them to their ""final resting place"", the risks are too great.  If something happened to them and they weren't able to return, that would cause a paradox which would cascade back to 1938 and blow the whole continuum wide open.

In fact, you never said ""You're right.  I had no reason to downvote.  I shall fix that.""  Instead you say this:

&gt;Since you've called me a douchebag and a fucking coward, I believe that qualifies as reason to downvote.

In other words, you pretty much said, ""I downvoted you because you insulted me"", knowing perfectly well that wasn't the case...you downvoted because you didnt agree.  In fact you admit to that here:

&gt;I'm a bitch for changing my mind BECAUSE YOU HAD A POINT

I couldn't care less about downvotes, but I DO care about people on reddit not following the rules and downvoting people because they don't agree with someone's opinion, and then be even MORE cheeky by accusing me of starting the issue.  Lets take a look at your very first comment to me, shall we?

&gt;Well, that takes either some big brass cajones or massive short sightedness. I'm going to call it a little from column A and a little from column B.

So WHO started the insults here?  That's right, YOU did.  Now go count how many downvotes I gave you.  That's right, none.  Despite your little attempt to START a fight, I let it go.  

You have to be a REAL douche to get a downvote from me.  But I WILL stand my ground when people start shit.

I called you out, just like I call out anyone who does the same thing here.  

If you don't like that, then you have two choices:

1. Kiss my ass and continue being a coward.

2. Change your ways.

Just admit you were in the wrong next time instead of trying to cover up the bullshit.

Remember, YOU started all this crap because you disagreed with my opinion.

Don't like my **opinion** (something which all people have a right to)?  Then fuck **YOU.**

In my eyes disparaging someone's opinion is the greater 'crime' here.

Now, I'm done with this.  I think you have been sufficiently chastised.  Feel free to downvote the living fuck out of me.  Hell, go visit every one of my posts and downvote them...I don't care.

I'm hoping you won't.  Not because of my 'score' but because Reddit is what people make of it.  

In other words, I'm hoping you try to listen to other people's opinions from now on instead of making disparaging remarks.  And I'm also hoping you (as well as everyone else) try to realize that downvotes are not a form of punishment.

Lastly, I AM willing to discuss the original topic with you like a man if you wish and put all this bullshit behind me.  we can start over.  If you don't want to, I understand.  But I AM willing.

Losing 5m a month, Mittal considering withdrawing... this sort of thing is never exactly welcome but it would be tolerable if at least we were winning. Can we leave the bickering until a time of stability, please?

Everything *is* a bit :/ at the moment.

When we're going through a crisis (can we call it a crisis yet?) we need everyone to rally round and put on a brave face. 

If the board starts losing its head and the fans start losing the faith and the players stop believing in the manager it'll just make things worse. 

Support the team with the surety of mind that we have the quality necessary to win any game we play.

Regarding books, which I mentioned... most of the important lessons are fairly easy to learn... pick up a copy of [the goal](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Goal-Eliyahu-M-Goldratt/dp/070450636X/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349219382&amp;sr=1-3), [new solution selling](http://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Solution-Selling-Revolutionary-Changing/dp/0071435395/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349219416&amp;sr=1-1), [Information Dashboard Design](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Information-Dashboard-Design-Effective-Communication/dp/0596100167/ref=pd_sim_b_1) and [successful business intelligence](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Successful-Business-Intelligence-Secrets-Making/dp/0071498516/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349219516&amp;sr=1-1) from your university library, spend about a week (max) skimming through them and you'll have a sound idea of how to apply knowledge of statistics &amp; analysis from many uni courses to business settings.  Other than that success is much more down to personal interactions, so reading classics like [how to win friends and influence people](http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0091906814/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349219641&amp;sr=1-1) can help you understand how to work with some of the more awkward types you'll come across.  Successful people where I've worked stand our more because they spend their time learning, and are generally interested in what's going on with other people's work, not because of studying for an MBA.

Depending on the field you're looking to work in, success at interviews in my experience was found by those who prepared well, not by those with the best grades or CV... so practice case studies, answering HR questions and talking about your CV till you sound polished... good luck!",0,1349219773,null,0,1349220024,0,c6gpq4x,t3_10ttqm,t1_c6gpq4x,t1_c6go5jb,null,1430048194,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0
true,Godhatesfats,null,null,"Agreed. Hughes is hardly infallible but calling for him to be sacked will be 0% beneficial and 100% detrimental. We do not want to introduce more uncertainty and risk turning what is a slump -- but nothing more than a slump -- into something much more serious. 

We have the players and we've shown that we can play football to match pretty much anybody. 

We conceded two really, really shitty goals yesterday. This coincides well with the copious amounts of defensive injuries we've suffered: it's essential for defenders to know and get used to each other, more so than for midfielders or attackers, which is why putting out a new, increasingly makeshift defensive line every game makes us look shaky as hell at the back. 

Having said that, Mbia looked very good; he's exactly the kind of modern defender who can not only win the ball but start offensive moves with his passing. Onuoha was absolutely catastrophic though, and Hill was only a little bit better than that. 

Once we got a grip of ourselves and started playing football (and put that nightmare of a first half behind us) it was evident that we were the better side, just as we've been in many of the games we've lost or drawn. Eventually things will turn around. The team will perform. Believe.

OP gives a long list and then adds on, ""it would be great to see all of them"". As for adding old Doctors Mary Jane as a companion can link up with any doctor reasonably easily without changing the tone. The thing is each doctor had their own style and tone and of course the era. Despite being an old soul the new doctors are the youngest we've ever seen. This follows the social trend and realization that young people can do as much and in many cases more than the old. The generational differences like this mean that bringing back an old doctor could potentially make the show stumble on itself a bit. As for Rose I basically agreed with you. As much as I'd like to see her on screen again I think that it would sacrifice the integrity of whatever story/arc/episode she appeared in and thats mostly what I don't want to happen with the return of too many old characters. You cited the older villains as an example of successful integration into the new series. I disagree though. I think the Cybermen are the best example of my point. Gone are the silly men in spraypainted pants and masks, and in their place are shiny metal robots. ""Ceci n'est pas une cyberman"" This is not a cyberman. They may call it one and it may closly resemble the cybermen but in reality it is a New Series Cyberman. Overall its back to the issue of tone. The Cybermen and Daleks are back yes, but as an updated form of themselves to fit the new series and modern society. The same diffrence exists that you cant update a Doctor in the same way (and therefore you have to alter the overall feel of the episode to include one). at least not without enraging everyone who remembers that Doctor.",0,1349221815,null,0,false,0,c6gqalv,t3_10s2rb,t1_c6gqalv,t1_c6govi1,null,1430048461,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Now, the linear take is that Amy and Rory are dead. But from a non-linear standpoint, Rory and Amy are still ""alive"". The past from the point in which they lived in is now the present to them, therefore becoming their current time stream, which can be altered if done properly.

Compared to S1-2 it had a fuller and much more interesting story arc (that whole Gray thing was a snoozefest), much better acting and less unneeded Jack worshipping. 

The main complaints I've heard is that it's badly paced and it left too many threads hanging. I like how they took their time and showed the magnitude of the Miracle and its consequences. Of the 10 episodes there was only one that I felt was superfluous (Immortal Sins) and that's mostly because it was very Jack-centric and I cannot stand him. During my latest rewatch I had to concede that it had merit (though, I must admit that the whole Jack/Angelo thing is awfully executed). 

About the loose threads, I like it when things aren't fully explained or resolved. Like the guy from the server room. His involvement is never explained. For me, that's not a problem, since they didn't need to know that to get to the endpoint. In real life situations, things are never wrapped up in a neat little package at the end of the day.

They have a different superpower in each separate episode they show up in - and their new powers never get mentioned later, and no one asks why the power didn't apply previously.

Why don't they just cover themselves with a large sheet and stay under it? They can move in the dark or behind walls - you have to *see* them and not just *know* that they're there.

If they're covered, you can't *see* them, so they can move.

He did die, as an old man, but he hadn't regenerated - he was recognizable.

His second death didn't happen, because even if he was the Master, the regeneration would have been enough to cause the paradox, so the whole thing didn't happen. Even if he could choose to regenerate looking the same, choosing to regenerate differently would have achieved his goal of not being trapped by the angels. (If he's not the Master, the death would have caused a paradox, too, of course.)

I didn't realise you weren't finished with Miracle Day so I hope I didn't inadvertently spoil anything. 

I think some of the split between MD lovers and haters can be attributed to whether people prefer long arcs or a more self contained episode format. S1-2 obviously follow the latter while S4 is definitely one long arc. Season 3 is a bit more difficult to place because while it is one arc, it's still only a 5 episode miniseries so there's not really much time for people to ""get over it"".

This is something I think American TV shows are able to steer away from with their ~22 episode seasons. They manage to have long arcs but broken up into chunks with self contained (or ""filler"") episodes in between.

true,bairy,uk,Birmingham,"**tl;dr**: Based on my twitter following an in my summarised experience of that, Virgin are good but when problems happen they can be big, First are okay but seem to get more negative feedback.

This seems like a good place to add something about Virgin vs First. There have been a lot of people on here who have given their opinions on both companies, generally Virgin great, First shit.

I've been following both Virgin (not cross country) and FGW's twitter feeds over the last couple of weeks to see what people were saying about them.

**Virgin**

In general I've found that Virgin have a LOT of praising tweets (maybe 90%) but when the complaints come in their usually pretty strong.

Quite a few bad wifi service (which is damn expensive in standard class), and mostly crowding issues which could be down to the undersized Voyagers and would be the same under whoever ran it.

Worst story is one guy [who said he](http://www.papasotherworld.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/here-is-gist-of-letter-i-have-written.html) was humiliated, bullied and dumped at an unfamiliar station because he accidently boarded the wrong train at a confusing station.

Virgin (and some others) are also allowing free travel for police officers on the 3rd/4th October, since officers are travelling to Manchester to cover officers going to the funeral of the two killed officers. FGW are not doing such an offer, as far as I can tell.

**FGW**

FGW also get some praise, but also many complaints including two things that rather alarmed me.

A girl got robbed, spoke to police, approached FGW staff member who basically said they can't do anything and she'd have to pay her own way home. Since she had her cards stolen too she had to get her brother to book a ticket. Since it was for her there was a £10 admin fee on top. FGWs twitter basically said ""yup, that's the policy"". I mean even if she was trying to sponge a free journey they could've dropped the admin fee. **EDIT**: Found the twitter account. https://twitter.com/BiscuitGirl786 - scroll down to the bottommost @FGW post on 28 Sep and read upwards.

The other is that they only give refunds when they are to blame. So if you're 4 hours late cos a tree fell on the line then tough shit. Virgin isn't too clear on this that I can see, but seem to suggest you can claim vouchers even if they aren't to blame for the delay.

Also, dunno if this is relevant or not, but FGW are hiring G4S personel to travel on their trains as security.

So based on my twitter feed monitoring I think Virgin is the better company overall, though I know they aren't perfect.",0,1349230520,null,0,1349280927,0,c6gspr8,t3_10uf4q,t1_c6gspr8,t3_10uf4q,null,1430049602,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Time can be altered from that point on as they can only conceive the present. Basically, Amy cemented the fact that until the book is published, the Doctor cannot see them. After that, their timeline becomes timey whimy. 

They could have easily placed a tombstone in that spot and then traveled back to their respective timelines.

Getting back to the point, they aren't dead until you see they're dead. Are they likely coming back? It depends on how the writers want to continue the story.

First off, Amy and Rory don't have to go down to Florida to fetch her -- she regenerated in NYC.

But the rest of the episode, from River being in NYC to begin with (when she finds Rory) to basically telling Amy to get snatched by the statute, makes me think it was all River's plot from the beginning to get her past self raised by her parents in such a way that the Doctor couldn't take them away from her.

If this was River's plot all along, it fixes some of the plot holes people have been complaining about, such as why she writes the novel in the first place, to why Rory's name was on the tombstone before he got zapped.

It also explains why River/Melody acts familial with the Ponds, they actually did raise her as their daughter, just not yet.

Bedder 6 pays Clarkson a £300k (assuming typo in article as numbers don't make sense otherwise) fee annually and on top of that he received an extra fee of £156k for work outside of his contract.

The bulk of the money came from dividends of Bedder 6. The company paid out just over £9m in dividends of which Clarkson received 30% which equates to £2.7m.

The increase in his pay came because Bedder 6's profit increased to £19.5m and so they paid out more dividends.

It's hard to include Lucas since he hasn't played in the new system, but I feel comfortable enough to include him right in front of the centerbacks anyway for his great defensive nositioning. Allen does better on defence a bit further up the pitch where he can press high and quickly, and could drop for the ball once in possession. Both wingers are so fucking fast and skilled, they can easily swap sides- I like how they both can cut ii on their right foot from the left wing too. Gerrard is there cuz Gerrard... and hopefully with the energy the other 2 midfielders bring he doesn't have to wear his aging legs too much, although we know how much he loves doing so.

The holding midfield position requires a very specific skillset that isn't immediately apparent. For starters, they have to win possession from the opposition through tackles and interceptions (which Luiz is pretty adept at). They also have to maintain possession and generally play simple passes at all times - as a result, they often have extremely high passing success percentages. Luiz has a tendency to punt the ball up the field when options seem limited - it would be difficult to restrain this tendency. I'm not sure that Luiz could equal the 90% passing rates that Mikel seems to maintain. Finally, the holding midfielder has to move up to cover for other players when they push up the pitch; having played CB his entire career, Luiz would struggle to get the awareness of when to push up or when not to. 

Interestingly enough, most DMCs are far less attacking than Luiz is from the CB position, because the position is primarily designed to win and maintain possession. I can only really think of Yaya Toure as a DM that often makes runs up the pitch, but he really only seems to do so when partnered with another defensive midfielder (Barry or De Jong).",0,1349239305,null,0,false,0,c6gv4s0,t3_10uuaa,t1_c6gv4s0,t3_10uuaa,null,1430050810,6,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,6

Honestly, how mysterious and all-mighty would he be if you find out his name is Jeff. 

The question of ""Doctor Who?"" all depends on how it's said and which word the emphasis is on. 

For example, ""Doctor Who*?* Doctor Jones?"" ~ is that his name?
Which is the popular theory. 
However I like to think its more of a:
""Doctor *Who*?!"" ~ I've never heard of him before. 

My reason for this is that the theme of this series is that everyone is forgetting The Doctor so on the Fields of Trenzalore, The Doctor will be present along with any and all his enemies. The Doctor will then preform a speech similar to the one from ""Pandorica Opens"" and instead of everyone running away at the sound of his name, they will no longer fear him and proceed to do something nefarious.

true,RCalorel,null,null,"I'm surprised no one's mentioned The Wedding of River Song yet.  Which is my least favorite -- even beating out Love and Monsters.

Here's why:

-River's character has grown less and less interesting.  In the Tennant episodes, she's a strong, independent, and mysterious woman from the Doctor's future.  By TWoRS, she's no longer mysterious, she's completely dependent on the Doctor, and no longer strong.  Her entire character was centered around being in love with the Doctor, so much so that she lost what made the character fun.

-Time is all taking place at once? It sounds like a cool idea, but if you think about it, it makes no sense.  I think I read a similar complaint on IO9 -- time in this weird timeline is still going forward: people still get from one place to another, time is still linear, and the Silence are said to be ""waiting"" (an act you can't do without ""time"").  Really, it's more just an anachronistic stew with broken clocks.

-Bringing me to the continuity issues.  The really big one being ""Time can/cannot be rewritten.""  Series Five makes a huge thing over the fact that ""Time can be rewritten.""  Amy and the Doctor say it nonstop.  Even further back, The Waters of Mars makes in abundantly clear that ""fixed points in time"" don't really exist.  Ten changes a fixed point, in an emotionally-fueled episode, and it was such a huge deal that it helped bring about his downfall (at least in his state-of-mind).  I know Moffat has gone on the record stating that continuity doesn't really exist in a show about time travel like Doctor Who, but I think that's a BS excuse for poor writing.  

-Also, when the hell does the last scene between River, Amy, and Rory take place.  It makes no sense in any of their timelines.

I think I'll agree that Love and Monsters is a worse episode overall, but it's not a ""big"" episode.  TWoRS was a series finale, supposed to be epic, supposed to give us a sense of closure for the season.  But, it was a huge letdown.

Of course, that's my opinion, and I know there're plenty of people that love this episode.  I just can't really see why.

true,ProvenLogic,null,null,"""6.The Doctor hasn't yet told River his name.""

You sure about that?  I think that's what everyone rightly assumes, and what Moffat wants you to think, but i for one think he's already told her his name, and did so about a year ago, in ""Let's Kill Hitler"".  

At the end of LKH when the dying doctor asks to speak to River, he whispers something to her, and we all know when Moffat has someone whisper something it's never what you're supposed to think it is.  In that moment, the doctor says, ""Find her, find River Song, and tell her something for me *whispers*"".  Now, everyone assumes that he whispered ""I Love You"".  I do not believe so.  I believe he whispered ""My name is _____"" (and possibly ""i love you"" as well).

Now, why do i believe this?  River's reaction to what he says.  River responds, ""Well, i'm sure she knows.""  This is not the response you would expect to hear from someone who's just been told to tell a loved one that their loved ones' last words were ""I love you"".  At this point River doesn't even know for sure who ""River"" is, or for sure that the doctor loves her (though she's clueing in to that).  I think the reaction of ""Well, i'm sure she knows"" fits FAR better if, weirdly from her point of view, the doctor whispers, ""My name is _____""... *""Well, i'm sure she knows"", like DUH.*

I believe the only time he can tell someone his name is not when he gets married, but when he's actually going to die, die. Now yes, he may have been thinking River could save him with her regeneration energy, but even so he still knows, at least for a moment, he's going to die, die.  I think from that very first day they met, River's known his name; which is why she is ""so sorry"" in the ""Library"" episode when she tells him his name, because she knows she's telling him he's going to die, die at some point (and she knows she can tell him nothing more at that point, leaving him to think he's gonna just die sometime).  So, why would she be ""so sorry"" to tell him his name if it only meant they were married?  
*I'm sorry, i'm so sorry, but you're gonna marry me and i'm a MILF and you're gonna be stuck with me?*  
OR  
*I'm sorry, i'm so sorry, but you're going to die, and i'm gonna be there.*  
The latter makes more sense to me.


Now, the grand theory of ""the fall of the eleventh"".  There's still a lot in my idea that's not fleshed out, so i'll just put down some points i think will turn out to be:

Will it be the actual end of 11?  Possibly, probably.  It could be a metaphorical fall (and it wouldn't shock me if it was), but something about Moffat tells me he's keeping this one in his pocket for the actual end of Matt's tenure.

I have no doubt in my mind that River will be there.

I have NO idea what catastrophe the silence are trying to prevent, but it's obvious (DUH) that it's the doctor's name being made known that will ""cause"" (truthfully or only in their minds) it.

How will we avert the catastrophe and make it to the next episode or series?  Well, as i said, i don't know if we will without the doctor regeneration, but i think it's safe to say that, ultimately, we'll avert the catastrophe somehow.  And i think this is how:  River knows the doctor's name already.  

I have absolutely no clue about the specifics, but i'm betting that the fact that River already knows the doctor's name (a la my theory on ""Let's Kill Hitler"") will be revealed at this moment, and this will somehow save the universe from disaster.  As we know, on the fields of trenzalore no one can lie or fail to answer, and we believe the question will be concerning the doctor's name.  Now either the silence will expect that no one knows it, and thus the revelation of the answer will be bad, or perhaps that everyone has forgotten it, or maybe they're banking on no one knowing it to keep their dastardly plan alive.  Who knows?  But i think River already knowing it will be the key.

So these are my predictions.  I've not seem similar ones posted anywhere so perhaps it's a new prediction for everyone to mull over.  Or perhaps it isn't and i'm rehashing old news.  Either way, it's what i've pieced together, what do you all think?

If it's part of a meta-campaign (which is not above Moffat, karen, arthur, or matt to participate in) then we may well see them again.  In which case you can insert any number of theories as to how.  The doctor visits them to have an adventure but drops them back off in 19XX, or the gravestones were faked, or this all ties into the ""fall of the eleventh"", or anything really.  

It all hinges on Karen's desire to return and guest star (and also if Moffat is keen to backtrack if her desire is genuine, but she changes her mind later on).

After all, we do here in TPO3 the doctor's line ""swingsets to swing on"" which could very well be nothing OR a reference to the final scene of TATM.  It would not surprise me if the first episodes were in Pond order, but not doctor order.  At the very least this could be true for TPO3, as the doctor's candid time with Amy on the river bank speaks VOLUMES to him knowing what's to come for them.  Perhaps his new companion urges him to go back and visit them at the end of this series?  

Equally as there was no evidence to debunk it, there was no evidence to support it in TATM either.  It's not as if the doctor gave his age in ATCM (1200) and then said in TATM he was 1137.  However, i suspect that Moffat dropped the age of the doctor in ATCM for a purpose, something to compare to later on.  Same trick he used in ""the impossible astronaut"".

Although Moffat has playfully hinted in one of the Confidentials that he might still have something fun in store for how River knows his name. He could just be trolling, though.

My other curiosity is if the Doctor merely told River his name in LKH, why would that prompt her to save him? I think the reason the ""I Love You"" theory is so popular is because of the way River reacts to hearing it. If he'd just told her his name, she'd have been like ""DUH"" and moved on. But hearing what he said becomes very personal to her once she realizes SHE is River Song.

This may be a matter of interpretation, but as I understood the episode, in the context of the episode the future became fixed when Rory viewed the headstone.  In the same way the future became fixed when the Doctor read the chapter titles.  I take this reading from the fact that the Doctor tells them not to read the chapters so as to not created fixed points which cannot be changed.  If there is a reason to *not* create a fixed point, it stands to reason that things can be changed until they are fixed.  In the logic of the show, I believed this to be the result of one of two circumstances: 1) when someone acts or 2) when someone has foreknowledge of the future, which is why River's book is so dangerous.

I understand what you're saying about Amy's name appearing, because Amy acted.  Once she had done that, she necessarily had created  a fixed point and therefore had to have gone back in time, lived, died and then been buried there.  With Rory, however, all we have is writing on a stone and, as I said, writing on a stone does not mean that someone is dead and buried there.  Rory did not act, nor did Rory know he was going to die.  In fact, Rory specifically believed someone else had died.

Your reading of the episode is far more deterministic and paints Rory being sent back in time by the angel as an event like the rise of Hitler or the suicide of Van Gogh.  I do not have a specific hole to poke in that theory, and it seems to be internally consistent.  My problem, emotionally, with this episode, is that I do not believe it works very well as a story to have Rory's death determined conclusively in the same way as a ""major"" historical event.  I do not feel like Rory sacrificed himself in a noble fashion.  I do not feel like he was tragically lost.  Obviously, I don't feel like he lived happily ever after (though in some sense you could say he did).

I'd say this is exactly the same for all of the companies with fingers in both pies, like Stagecoach (who own 49% of Virgin Trains) or Go-Ahead. It has as much relevance as whinging about Virgin Trains because your Virgin Atlantic plane is late or your Virgin Media internet connection is slow.

Obviously it differs in different parts of the country but down here FGW are reasonably punctual, and when they aren't it's down to genuine issues like train faults (might be First's fault, might not) or network issues (not First's fault). I'd argue the stock and track does matter - FGW for example will be battling with keeping older trains going, which may mean more unreliability and higher costs compared to Virgin who don't have that problem. Even the Adelante trains are not renowned for reliability and they're much newer. Or the track, if there are network issues due to aging infrastructure then FGW get all of the public blame even though it's not under their control.

However much time we spend here analysing it, I would imagine one's first reaction would be, ""well, why the heck did you go with him again?"".

I don't know, but I don't think it's a case so much of fear (fear of beating or whatever), more (perhaps) of manipulation. As the author says ""people who [are] told that they have no agency are less likely to behave as though they do"".

I have said elsewhere in this thread that this failure showed systemic negligence on the part of Rochdale police.

While River looks shocked, the doctor completely oblivious and lost, and he's just sipping on his tea. Because no mother fucker hits on his wife and simply gets away with it. 

Remember when the greatest victories didn't involve saving the universe? He didn't say that shit just to make a point, he meant it, and used it to fuck  with your head. The angels weren't taking over Manhattan. Rory simply happened to be in Manhattan and the angels were drawn to the temporal anomaly of his presence. When they tried to fuck his shit up, they instantly realized who he was and what they were fucking with, hence the lack of angels in the last 20 minutes of the episode. 

When the universe wants to go to the bathroom, it asks Rory for permition. When shit hits the fan, everyone makes sure Rory is okay with it. The doctor has so far been spared this privilege, since he's married to Rory's daughter and all. But he too will soon spend most of his free time asking Rory if what he's doing is okay. 

When the last angel ""disappeared"" Rory, it wasn't because it chose to. It was because Rory was tired of the doctor fucking with his wife. That angel did it because he willed it. It smiled, because it was finally free of the Rory. The Rory dominates all, runs the universe and does as he wishes. NOBODY fucks with Rory, and anyone who has ever tried, never bothered to ask the doctor, the angels, or the rest of the fucking universe. Wait until the vashta nerada find out what kind of shit they've dug themselves into. Rory is going to be PISSED.

Im getting really annoyed at people who also bitch about how terrible the ending of the most recent episode was.  I would go so far as to say that Roses departure was much more silly and frustrating.

Doctor Who is not about taking science seriously.  It never has been.  It's an adventure story that happens to take place in time and space.  Moffat has stayed loyal to the story he wanted to tell.  Sure, some if it makes me question parts of the story; when has Doctor Who not made you do that?

edit:

Oh gawd.  Also, someone in there said that Moffat's stories feel like fan fiction.  How does that even make sense?  What exactly counts as cannon doctor who?  The writers and actors have constantly changed through out it's entire existent.  If you ask me, a fan of the show writing for the show seems like someone perfectly suited for the job. 

If you really want to stay cannon you might as well make every episode that takes place in the past be a history lesson and every episode that takes place in the future be built on educating the viewer on ""Tomorrow Land"" ideas and science.

1) TATM-there are many possibilities here.  Option 1 is Rule #1 of course.  The Doctor Lied.  Option 2 is that there would still be a paradox.  Rory and Amy both saw the gravestone where Rory has to have died.  If he goes back to another time/place, there would still be the paradox which could still have consequences.

2) TPo3-This was not supposed to be an episode about the enemy.  This was meant to be an episode showing how the Ponds were ready to live a normal life without the Doctor.  To show how they have matured since season 5.  It also showed much character development for the Doctor himself.  We never really see the Doctor the way we did in this episode, and I loved it.  

3)  ATCM-I really am sick and tired of seeing this 'The Doctor doesn't use guns or kill people!!' bullcrap.  [Just watch the classic series.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=lzmnPs64K74)  Also, remember Nine?(oh right, a lot of people skipped him)  Remember the second episode how he let Cassandra 'die'?  Or even the episode 'Dalek'.  He was ready to use that gun to kill the Dalek, but Rose stopped him.  So after all his 900 or so years, all the people who got killed because he showed mercy, I think the Doctor is allowed to be angry.

4)  DoAS-I believe this was more or less just an episode to introduce Brian in to the show.  It is hard to tell, but he may be of some importance in the upcoming episodes.  It certainly wasn't the best episode from season 7, but it was not bad at all.  Almost seemed like a 'filler' episode, just something fun.

5)  AotD-I agree that I was surprised that the Doctor did allow all those Daleks to do whatever it is they are going to do instead of stopping them.  But the main point of this episode was to introduce Oswin, and to show the beginning of the Doctor being forgotten.

Even if he scores 20 goals in the prem this season, you can bet that over half those goals will be assisted by a 40-50 yard long ball from a centre-back or a full-back. He would never get that kind of service in our side. He isn't a bad player, he's just a bad fit for Liverpool. 

Also, there is no compulsory buy-out clause in the loan agreement. (reliable source: http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/aug/30/andy-carroll-west-ham-united-liverpool). Earlier in the summer it looked like we had agreed a loan to West Ham with a compulsory buy-out clause which would become active if they avoided relegation, but Carroll didn't want to move permanently. 

However, simply because there is no compulsory buy-out clause doesn't mean that Carroll won't move in the summer. If he has a good season at West Ham then I would imagine (and hope) that he moves for something in the region of 17 million pounds.

true,kris_lace,null,null,"I am an actual conspiracy theorist and a liverpool fan. And I have a few points...

Firstly this time-frame of 20 years and the stats aren't a great benchmark for looking at the issue. 

Quick example, say liverpool play manu 20 times. Stats show Man U get more red cards and yellow cards - looks like they're treated more unfairly or they're more aggressive - whichever. But once we pick the numbers a part, we may find that the 4 cards we got were all during semis for cups or important games. If this writer is seriously addressing a conspiracy then he should account for the weight of important games and losing decisions in the less important games. And that's based on cards being a good indicator of the ref decisions - which it isn't. 

The other thing to note is, this isn't a conspiracy per-say. It's a pattern - recently lfc fans &amp; the manager feel Manu get better decisions. They have. But the thing about patters is, it could just very well be that Fergie just gets what he wants by whatever means 'each time' he plays us recently rather than actually pre-arranging an actual conspiracy. 

My conclusion? It's a silly topic and the writer is silly. But the facts are we've definitely had bad decisions recently - outright. I would love nothing more than a 90 minute un-stopped game of just football with manu - because it seems like the outcome's always due to some decision. 

On a last note - we have had bad decisions - then BR spoke to the referees about it - then we got a disallowed obvious penalty against Norwich right afterwards. Hopefully 'some' referees may notice this an hopefully try to be better at their jobs for us in the future as a matter of pride for their profession personally and as a whole.

As an aside my issue with her isn't whether she is right or wrong to want to lower the abortion time limit, but her using feminism to 'prove' it is not a religious or Tory issue and her concern comes from the affect it has on women. It is very much a religious and Tory issue, and no amount of dressing it up will show it as otherwise.

Oh, also I love the subtle bootstrap paradox here, in that 'old' River shows the Doctor how to fly the Tardis better, and he later uses that knowledge to show 'young' River how to fly it better, so that she eventually becomes 'old' River and teaches him so that he teaches her, etc, in an infinte loop.   *Where* does the knowledge of how to fly the Tardis better actually come from?  

Total paradox, typical *Doctor Who* lunacy, and I love it!

You may think that a fried breakfast is something that doesn't need a recipe but I guarantee that if you follow this one you'll never regret it. 
 
 
1. Wake up in a Georgian country house with a hangover of biblical proportions. Slide your arm from beneath the slender alabaster neck of the recumbent debutante and silently pick your way through the detritus of last night's party to the kitchen. 
 
 
2. As soft golden sunlight arcs low across the paddock and gilds the chromework of the Aga like melted butter, find a big pan. 
 
 
3. Heat an unconscionable quantity of oil to a gentle simmer and slip in the freshly made local sausages. Sausages should not be pricked and never fried. The intention is that they should poach in the oil. 
 
 
4. As the sausages poach make tea. If it is a proper farmhouse there will be a gigantic 'Brown Betty' teapot of the type used to fortify British battalions throughout the last Great Unpleasantness. Add a spoonful of leaf tea (need we mention the sordid subject of bags?) for each person and 'one for the pot'. At this point the kettle will start its song, beginning the process of gently awakening the recovering partygoers. Pour the water over the leaves. The tea serves the same purpose to a hungover Englishman that chicken soup serves to a Jewish New Yorker with a headcold and hives. This is not cooking...it's an emergency clinical intervention. An Englishman's mother will offer him tea as first response medical aid even if his arm has been severed by a combine harvester. 
 
 
5. Move the sausages to the warming oven, pour off all but a light glazing of the oil and begin to brown the bacon. Much has been written about good bacon and I do not propose to repeat it. Suffice it to say...smoked...streaky...thin...crisp. Place in the warming oven when done. 
 
 
6. Open a can of Heinz baked beans -accept no substitute- these are not so much a foodstuff as an architectural element of the finished plate. Think of beans as colour and a concealer of disheartening flashes of empty plate between meats. 
 
 
7. Mushrooms and tomatoes may be grilled at this stage but no gentleman would consider eating them. They are vegetables. Vegetables are a form of table decoration. They aren't food - they go next to food. As the great Dr Johnson should have said 'Vegetables are what food eats' and I have no intention of disagreeing. 
 
 
8. Americans eat hash browns at breakfast. Theay are disagreeable to an Englishman. I understand that the French, who can make food out of almost anything, use them to sole espadrilles. 
 
 
9. There are many different ways to cook eggs but most of them are purely of interest to invalids, children and the feeble-minded. The correct or 'proper English egg' is fried with lightly browned edges in the fat left over from the bacon. At the last minute, oil is flicked over the top of the yolk to seal it. This dangerous procedure causes the yolk to form a perfect, golden, viscid capsule, the violation of which with a rough shard of toast, is the nearest that an Englishman will permit himself to unbridled sexual ecstasy. 
 
 
10. While the eggs are being coaxed into tumescence the first of the walking wounded will have arrived in the kitchen. Ignore the bashful looks and tousled hair and administer tea in large quantities. Mugs enable fingers to thaw and many a tryst has been sealed by a coy glance over the chipped china rim. The more robust may be set to the simple task of toast. 
 
 
11. Working quickly, lay down toast, top with an egg, flank with bacon and sausage and fill the spaces with beans. Serve forth.",0,1349259940,null,0,false,0,c6gxws6,t3_10thvx,t1_c6gxws6,t3_10thvx,null,1430052122,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt;well Miller is saying the abortion time limit is an issue and it's not anti-feminist to say so. you can't just say 'it's a religious issue' and not deal with it. you don't have to be a tory or religious to have an issue with our late abortion time limit, and Miller seems to want to point that out.

No she is saying she is a feminist, and therefore her viewpoint is that of how it affects the woman. She is using the term feminist as 'spoonful of sugar' to those who may otherwise rebel against the idea if it was shown in its true Tory/religious light.

I agree that Smith is at his very best here, playing the suave-braniac-hero-saving-the-day-with-a-quip-while under-immense-pressure so well here that it seems a shame they moved away from allowing the Doctor to be a old-fashioned good guy much since the end of Series 5.

true,Variola13,null,null,"&gt;yes, and with a valid point behind that. If you don't have a problem with the central point; that the abortion limit is/can be viewed as an issue primarily affecting women (and therefore 'feminist'); who cares if the author is a christian/mulsim/whatever?

No it isn't a valid point, it is only a valid point because Maria Miller and others say it is. The author is overtly Christian, and is therefore putting the Christian bias over in the reporting, and trying to dress it up as feminist. I have a BIG BIG problem with ANY faith trying to do that. We have enough 'Christian morals' seeping into our society as it is, the gay marriage issue is a prime example. Decisions that affect women ( or men for that matter) need to be made for the religious-free knee-jerk free reasons, not from some BS dressed up as feminism. 

&gt;I doubt anyone is being hoodwinked into changing their minds about the abortion limit simply because Miller or this Telegraph journalist says its a 'feminist' issue

Hoodwinked implies the reader cannot reason, of course they can, but anyone undecided on the issue may well be taken in by this 'oh I am a feminist, therefore I am doing what is good for women' farce. 

&gt;I just fail to see what you oppose here. Of course all journalists are biased one way or the other, so what?

I have made it clear enough what I oppose, really I have. If you cannot see what I mean then I suggest perhaps your own bias of faith is preventing you from seeing that.

People have to realise that if all they do is listen to BBC24 then they're not watching the news, they're watching a synopsis of the news.

What the BBC is able to do, because of its size and unique funding, is to provide the in-depth and investigative reporting aspect too.  People just need to realise where it is.  The likes of Hardtalk or BBC Radio4.  The BBC's  Newsnight itself has dominated investigative reporting in recent years.  The Orwell Prize for Investigative Journalism made a special award for the BBC's Newsnight production team alone it had so many entries one year.

Investigative Journalism is crucial but exceedingly expensive and the BBC is one of the few major outlets that is both willing and able to still provide it.  Often it is this style of investigation that leads to the bigger stories that break up the smörgåsbord of bland 24hr News - it's why there really does need to be a national debate on how it can be preserved because the Internet, for all the good it has done and needs to be protected, is killing it slowly with a death of a thousand cuts.  Without BBC style funding independent investigative journalism really does rely on the printed press.  It's only a few publications that can really still perform at the highest levels alongside the likes of the New Yorker, the FT, The Economist, and the Grauniad.

Your view was that the place was ""going down the crapper"". I have shown you articles to show that it's actually been improving, and if you can be bothered to look up statistics since the GFA, you'll see that my view is supported.

&gt;Just because somewhere is statistically safe it doesn't make it the safest place in the UK

I don't know what you mean. How can somewhere be statistically safe, but also unsafe? 

&gt;You can thank the Titanic centenary for the boost in popular tourist destinations for 2012

Tourism has been increasing every year since the GFA, except for 2011 actually, but my opinion is that was down to the wider global economy.

&gt;There isn't that many hotels so one would assume with the recent influx of tourists that all the hotels would be booked.

Hotels are businesses which cope with demand. If there weren't a demand, they wouldn't have high occupancy rates, and new hotel openings.

&gt;So forgive me if just agree with you and say Belfast is a super dooper place now because some tourists went there in 2012.

I never said it's some sort of utopia. In fact, I believe I said it had it's problems, some social, some economic.

&gt;whilst I wouldn't idly sit around and let people bag it out either

Seems to me that you do exactly that, when you say that you ""hear it's going down the crapper""

I like discussing the show...well, actually, NOT as much as the next Whovian, but I do enjoy it. I just feel like people complain about Moffat a lot, even though he's written some of the best of the Modern Who episodes (Blink, Empty Child/Doctor Dances, Girl in the Fireplace, Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead)

Does his stuff always completely adhere to the Who-Universe?  Probably not.  But in a 50-year-old science fiction show, I think he does try. Actual life intervenes, though.  For example, people are complaining that The Doctor could go back and visit Rory and Amy, so that doesn't make sense.  But Moffat and Karen Gillan both stated that they thought the emotional impact of that being the last time he saw them (at least in the airing timeline) was more dramatic. Technically, any Doctor could go back and revisit any companion (or other Doctor, really). But, you know, actors age and move on.  Sometimes, you have to accept that in the story-telling process.

He's certainly got plans laid out better than LindCuse did for LOST. (Seriously - rewatch Silence/Forest - the way he's laid out River's small details is impressive, no matter what you think of her character.)

I think sometimes people forget, too - he is probably one of the biggest Doctor Who fanboys of them all.  (Ever see Coupling?  Tons of Who references in that show.)

It was a good show of force, but was ultimately nothing more than an aggressive science experiment

As for nukes themselves, the Mexican standoff situation has been beneficial for the world. With the advent of nuclear weapons the idea of Great Power wars became almost impossible, and although the Soviets and Americans conducted numerous proxy wars neither actually wanted to go to war with the other. What nukes do is force everyone to the negotiation table, because even if you nuke your enemy there is a very high probability that they will do the same to you. And what is the point of ""winning"" a war if your own country is a radioactive wasteland? So I would say that nuclear weapons combined with global trade are the main things keeping the peace today, and had the Soviets and Americans not had nuclear weapons then they would have gone to war directly at the cost of more lives than WW2.

The main issue with nukes today is the chance that terrorist groups will obtain them, for example if Pakistan's government collapsed and the Taliban seized control, or if a corrupt general ""lost"" a warhead.

Getting rid of nuclear armaments in a whole scale way is theoretically possible on a inter-governmental level, but the technology is out there for factions not affiliated with recognised nations to develop nuclear weapons. 

We maintain a nuclear arsenal because none of the nuclear weapons states (China, the United Kingdom, Russia, the United States and France) want to be the first to lose their arsenal, along with the reasoning that North Korea, India, Pakistan and Isreal are all non-signatories of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and have all openly tested (apart from Isreal, who have a policy of opacity).

Yes, but she would be far from the first cast member to play more than one role on the show.  (The list of characters played by actors who were previously on the show in smaller roles includes the 6th Doctor and the 2nd Romana, not to mention Martha Jones and Amy Pond.)

She was already cast as the new companion when Moffat decided she would also be a good choice for ""Soufflé Girl"" in the first episode of the season, which is apparently a role that was mostly conceived before the decision was made of who would play it.  

The fact that the names have some similarity (if pre-broadcast IMDB is to be believed) is another indicator that there may be some connection between the characters planned, but do we do not know, at this point, that they are the same person.

Also, the book contained a footnote written by Amy which states that they (her and Rory) had lived a happy, Doctor-free life.

I like Matt Smith. He captures the feel of the original series splendidly.  I like that he's not too serious. I got tired and BORED of Emo Doctor. 

I finally watched some of the 7th Doctor's episodes last week. I saw a lot of that whimsey and not too seriousness. I loved it. Add number 7 to  my list of favorites. 

I saw parts of an episode with Tennant before I was finished with Eccelson's episodes. I thought Tennant was too over the top to like.

River is in NYC because she's dealing with the Angels issue.  That's what post-pardon River does.  Goes where there's trouble and tries to help.  That's also why she ends up (starts up?) in the Library.

&gt; to basically telling Amy to get snatched by the statute

Or she just wanted her parents to be together again, even at the cost of saying goodbye to them.

&gt; such as why she writes the novel in the first place

She writes the novel in the last place, after the events happen.  Wibbly-wobbly.

&gt;  to why Rory's name was on the tombstone before he got zapped

Rory getting zapped was a fixed event in time.  Amy getting zapped was not.

&gt; It also explains why River/Melody acts familial with the Ponds

They were best friends with her when ""Mels"" was growing up, so she's known them for most of her life, even though she didn't know right away that she was their daughter.

true,UnoriginalGuy,welsh,Wales,"Without trying to sound smug, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by UK banking. It is tightly regulated, so the banks have to offer free current accounts (what you call checking accounts), they will eventually kill your account if it goes unused for too long, but they don't typically have a minimal balance (maybe a minimal balance for a certain higher interest rate).    

Checks also don't exist here. Well, they do, but only for businesses. We pay everything using cards, cash, or something we call Direct Debits (which are like checks but faster, safer, and better). Essentially Direct Debits are bank to bank transfers but easier to set up and with [a guarantee](http://www.thesmartwaytopay.co.uk/directdebitexplained/pages/directdebitguarantee.aspx).     

Because of all the rules most banks in the UK offer a similarly high level of service. Including HSBC. The only bank I would maybe steer clear of is Santander because they're shit.    

You can also use almost any cash machine (ATM) for free (exceptions: those found in pubs, small shops, or train-stations). If it is outside of any bank (even not your bank) it will be free. Just look for the sign [""LINK""](http://www.link.co.uk/Pages/Home.aspx).    

My recommendation is to have your English wife open an account and then add you to it as a +1. As a foreigner, you will have no credit history, so you can get no overdraft, but if you're a named individual on a joint account she will accept the liability of offering the overdraft.    

Overdrafts are cheaper than the US but you should always set up a pre-agreed one. It is free and a lot less expensive than an un-agreed overdraft.    

TL;DR: Banking in the UK is like a Credit Union in the US. Except without the ATM fees.   ",0,1349278739,null,0,false,0,c6h180m,t3_10vmai,t1_c6h180m,t3_10vmai,null,1430053746,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

6. Yes , and also there are no off licenses , only Systembolaget, which os the government monopoly for selling alcohol. Actually this works well as there is a better choice and educated staff, their job is to stop people damaging themselves.

It is not my CHOICE to have a limited career because I have to take care of my kids. It's because my husband makes twice as much as I do.

Before we had kids, I made twice as much as him. It's been a long, sad road from there, but the upshot is that I now have to choose work that is family-friendly. That's the single most important criteria, even though we have fantastic childcare. There are certain things that a parent has to do, and some of them impinge on a standard workday. I'm an IT professional, so it's limiting.

The Doctor uses intellect, is respectful, kind, peaceful, generous, and light-hearted.

Jack is damaged. SEVERELY. His liaisons are his way of forgetting everything terrible, violent, and hurtful decision or action that he's been responsible for. Miracle Day explores this a little. Jack does what he feels he has to do because he knows he can. He also knows that the Doctor can't/won't. Since he cares a great deal for the Doctor, he doesn't want him to have to consider those actions which he would deem too hurtful to consider/take. Jack does so the Doctor doesn't have to. 

Barrowman and Tennant touch on this briefly in the recent special ""Doctor Who in America,"" and Barrowman has explained that in interviews and behind-the-scenes moments. 

Gwen inspires Jack to be more than a man whore. Owen, Toshiko, and Ianto are Jack's team - they rely on him and look to him for leadership and guidance. Other dynamics take over as well as the show goes on.

Paul Parker, a former Manchester United defender, currently does some punditry work for Eurosport, and this weeks article, as the the title so eloquently puts, talks about divers. Paul Parker is NOT a good pundit. He's very, very biased, and often writes redundant, worthless articles that I would rather have wiped my ass with sandpaper than have read.

Just look at the image that was chosen for the article: A CHALLENGE THAT WASN'T EVEN A DIVE.

1. There IS at least ten years missing from River's childhood history.  Maybe that was time spent being brainwashed by the Silence, but it seems more likely that they lost track of her after NYC, until much later in her life.

2. Amy was heartbroken about being robbed of the chance to raise Melody, and Rory wanted kids badly enough that it nearly shattered their marriage.  Sending them back to raise their daughter after all is just about the best gift anybody could give them.

3. Being significantly older than she looked would explain why young ""Mels"" was so precociously clever as a child.  She was actually a 20-something (perhaps even older) woman pretending to be a schoolgirl so she could be close friends with her future parents.

4. It seems like a complicated and dangerous scheme... but the adult River would already remember that it worked.

So, I guess I'm kind-of on board with this idea.

&gt;A number of different personal and social factors can contribute towards people becoming homeless. These may include one or more of the following:

&gt;**individual factors** including drug and alcohol misuse, lack of qualifications, lack of social support, debts - especially mortgage or rent arrears, poor physical and mental health, relationship breakdown, and getting involved in crime at an early age  
&gt;**family background** including family breakdown and disputes, sexual and physical abuse in childhood or adolescence, having parents with drug or alcohol problems, and previous experience of family homelessness   
&gt;**an institutional background** including having been in care, the armed forces, or in prison.

**Two**, you said, in these exact words:

&gt; From what I understand the only people who aren’t are those with drink and drugs problems.

Now, I keep asking you to answer that assertion. So, are you actually arguing 

a) that I wasn't homeless

or 
b) that I was homeless, but it must have been due to drink or drugs?

And, if a), why do you consider this to be the case?

All I've done is show that

The children that are really in danger in my opinion, are not the ones left to play a few minutes away from their house, but those who are finally let out into the big wide world (be it a job away from home or university etc.) without any knowledge of it.

Back in my Uni days I worked as an RA during freshers weeks and in the evenings my job was to look after the drunk and disorderly, and I can tell you that 90% of those who whisked off to hospital were those who had no experience of alcohol. Clearly this is an extreme example plucked very selectively from my personal experience, but I feel that the issues are analogous to the idea of giving children freedom. 

There are obviously boundaries, you don't let your 5 year olds take the bus 8 miles across town to visit their friends at night like you don't give a 12 year old a bottle of Smirnoff on his birthday.

The average bus ticket in the UK cost around 90p in 2010. (Table 5)

Rail fares are much more regulated than bus fares - so whatever a tentacle of the First Bus empire chooses to charge is completely irrelevant. What fares First set on roughly equivalent rail services (e.g. Great Western's intercity services) are much more relevant.

&gt; So, give them a monopoly over a track and see what they do in the later years of the contract. They will rise prices higher than Virgin would, they will provide less special offers and so forth, which was Virgin's argument about the contract.

What Virgin say should not be taken as gospel - they after all have a vested interest in denouncing First. I wouldn't necessarily believe what First say either.

By the way, interesting set of matches between today and tomorrow. Arsenal - Olympiakos and Panathinaikos - Spurs. 

Arsenal and Spurs are rivals from London that hate each other and have a very long, antagonistic history. Olympiakos and Panathinaikos are the same in Athens. They hate each other. There's a good chance that if Panathinaikos fans get rowdy towards Spurs fans, the Olympiakos fans will join in on our side. It will be glorious! 

The only way this would be more awesome would be if Spurs were playing against Aris in Thessaloniki. The Aris and PAOK rivalry is the most intense in Greece, imo, since their areas border each other. Lots of fights between the fans of the two clubs!

Maybe, but W&amp;S was running as an 'open access' operator, because the likes of Virgin weren't interested in running trains to places like Wrexham before they made it viable.

IMO it was a bit hypocritical of Branson to complain at British Airways tactics against his airline, and then go up against W&amp;S in the rail industry because it was 'Deutsche Bahn'. Turns out his airline is 49% Singapore Airlines...

For what it's worth, people I told about W&amp;S liked their prices but not the time the journey took or the 'round the houses' nature of their route. So they travelled from Chester with Virgin instead.

It happens. It's small scale and the police get called quickly, but it always seems to happen when Greek rivals play in Europe close together.

My best advice is stick with the police. The home fans will be let out of the stadium a bit earlier, with our boys being let out a little after the home fans have dispersed. The majority of home fans will be very, ver nice people and you'll probably really enjoy yourself with them if you go, but there's a small sect of Panathinaikos fans that have been getting crazy. The team is falling apart at the seams and a small group of drugged up hooligans/anarchists have decided to respond very negatively.

true,henleyregatta,hampshire,Hampshire,"Thrust SSC used a pair of Speys from a retired Phantom. Worked well enough to break the sound barrier, with 50,000 lbf thrust, to 760MPH. Wikipedia claims 110,000 BHP.

But breaking 1,000 MPH requires (apologies for sounding all Clarkson) **MORE POWER**. Much more -  power required scales with the *square* of speed, for a given vehicle.

So the Jet they're using is an EJ200[*] with ~23,000 lbf thrust. Their own website claims they can probably up this a bit and they expect it to produce 50% of the required power. With the Hybrid rocket firing they're estimating the equivalent of 160,000 BHP.

All in all they've added around 45% power, and are hoping to go about 30% faster than Thrust SSC. Right there you can see some challenges: the power increase is nowhere near a square of the speed increase, which means Bloodhound *must* be more aerodynamically efficient than Thrust SSC (the loophole in that power law: if you can make yourself more slippery, you don't need as much power). This also provides a clue as to the power configuration: Drag will scale with frontal area, and 1 engine needs half the area of 2[**]. But to get the power back they need a non-airbreathing (slim) engine, hence the rocket. 

Interestingly that also appears to be why they're using an F1 engine as the oxidiser pump - very high powered for it's size and weight. All important considerations when you're minimising frontal area.

[*] = Never let it be said that it's what you know... it helps having a petrolhead government minister as a sponsor / partner in your project...

[**] = Mind you, Speys were never the most svelt of engines anyway - when we insisted on replacing the J79 in the Phantom with the Speys (ostensibly for more sea-level thrust for launching from smaller UK carriers; really as a job-creation scheme for UK companies to support the political case) the running joke was Q:""What happens if you Spey a Phantom?""

true,MattSchm,silence,Silence,"""That's also why she ends up (starts up?) in the Library.""

She's there for a job.  She calls the doctor.  There's no similar explanation for why she happens to be in 1938 NYC at the exact spot Rory's got zapped back to.  The Doctor and Amy have the book.  There's no explanation for what River is doing there.

""she just wanted her parents to be together again, even at the cost of saying goodbye to them.""

Sure, but she seems to know that Amy and Rory will end up together.  There's a pretty big chance that they won't.  The Doctor doesn't know for sure.  But at the crucial moment, River reassures Amy that they will.  How does she know this?

""Rory getting zapped was a fixed event in time. Amy getting zapped was not.""

Why?  If the story before all the wibbles and wobbles was that Rory got sent back and River used this as an opportunity to send Amy back and get her parents back, this makes sense.  But it's never explained otherwise.

The grew-up-with Mels stuff is fine, but it just seems to me that River's attitude towards Amy and Rory has grown more familial and less friendish.

""She only lived out her toddlerhood in NYC. She lived as a child in England.""

She regenerates in 1970 in NYC.  Amelia Pond is born in 1989, and Mels appears to have become her childhood friend sometime after that.  There's 20 years missing in her timeline.  Rory is around ~31 when he's presumably zapped back to 1938 NYC.  He's there in 1970 when she regenerates, and he dies at age 82 in 1989.  Amy dies five years later, which means that both of them overlap with River's missing decades.",0,1349295687,null,0,false,0,c6h67pg,t3_10uj4g,t1_c6h67pg,t1_c6h13ap,null,1430056099,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Then even if that proof was required, how difficult is it to print some fake utility bill for a person who has already decided to stay here illegally and is ready to break the law anyway?

Police is also clueless btw - you can register either at the main office or at your local police station and if you choose the latter chances are you'll need to explain procedure to the staff yourself. Often they'll write your address down into some book, let's hope it lands into the global database after a while.

true,orbitalia,english,English in Sweden,"The BBC is a Publicly owned company, it has a budget less than Sky broadcasting, but I know which one I would consider a quality company. The BBC creates value for the country and exports its shows (like Top Gear, or excellent documentaries), where Sky tends to draw in advertising through outbidding for sports events and appealing to the lowest common denominator.

 I have worked for a (then) publicly owned company (National Air Traffic Services) I can only say after PPP things went downhill, I don't want to say too much about that.

Here in Sweden the government owns many companies, like Vattenfall, LKAB, Systembolaget, hell only last year it used to own every pharmacy in the country. These companies can still turn a good profit and these profits get put into the government coffers for reinvestment. As long as one has a non-corrupt well functioning government (which I agree is asking alot of our shower), it is better for society that these funds are handled and reinvested by government.

It could go a lot of ways.  For instance, Eleven is seriously injured and attempts to regenerate, but he doesn't have enough juice to do it properly... so he partially heals, at least enough to save his life, but not enough to change his face.

There's an awful lot of complaining, of course, about private vs public sector, but I haven't been aware of any sort of serious journalistic inquiry into the civil service and their methods for almost three decades now.

In the same way that having a house built leaves you entirely in the hands of your builders, regardless of your or the architect's plans,  every policy is ultimately in the hands of a service that is insulated from accountability and oversight by means of a sacrificial lamb called a cabinet minister.

true,[deleted],null,null,"That's not what we're questioning here. 

Why is it that girls don't like playing with circuits and stuff? That's what we're trying to get to. Statistically, yes, women don't go into those fields as much as men. We're not saying that's not true. The OP of this comment tree is implying that it's just 'what boys and girls like to do', as if it was an inherent, born trait, like by being an XY you are inclined to do math and by being XX you are inclined to be a housewife. That's not how it works.

I like playing with circuits and stuff, as a woman, because my dad was an engineer and was constantly doing this kind of thing around the house and I loved to help and watch when I was little. How many girls are exposed to circuits and stuff from an early age, or encouraged to do so at all? How many girl shows, magazines, pop stars, fictional characters, books, cartoons, etc. deal with science and math related themes? How many gear girls to be focused on their beauty, looks, dancing / singing abilities, writing, and things of the sort? How many builder, construction, policemen, fire fighter toys, characters, coloring books &amp; etc are girls? How many are boys? How many beauty pageants, dress up contests, and that kind of thing, are geared solely towards girls? Not only do they have no one to look up to in those fields, but they are conditioned to value their beauty, looks, thinness, quiet, shyness, and SO many other gender stereotypes, instead of being offered with a range of different values and interests focused on the INSIDE rather than on their appearance.

Then, the few ones that do develop an interest in this stuff despite the constant pull away from it (like me) are not treated seriously in the field, get bullied by their classmates, have to hear incessant lewd comments about them and other women, are expected to be dumber, etc etc etc. Just ask any woman in your field how they are treated n comparison to their male peers, or how males view them, and so on. Or, how do you (as a man, i'm assuming) view women thaty ou work with? Do you usually point out they're women when you work with them?

true,NotMud,null,null,"This issue comes up a lot, and the simple answer is that there's a legal basis for what the newspapers are doing at the moment.

It's illegal to print something which might prejudice a jury while proceedings are active. That means that from the point at which an arrest warrant is put out, to the point where the individual is convicted or acquitted, you can't print anything which might make the jury think ""oo-er, he's a bit sketchy isn't he"".

*However*, the media is extremely helpful to the police. Newspapers are permitted and indeed encouraged to help police with their investigation. In this case, stuff like the bloke's appearance could be genuinely useful in making somebody think ""oh yeah, I saw a bloke wearing two pairs of trousers on the day that the girl went missing"". It's the same reasoning behind publishing photos of the van, or the Land Rover.

Remember Raoul Moat? There was a warrant out for his arrest, he hadn't been arrested but the media was helping police with their investigation. Interestingly, if Moaty had been captured alive (and therefore police no longer needed help catching him), the papers would legally have had to revert to ""A 37 year old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and shooting two other people"".

Anyway this hasn't been a very well-structured explanation of the law, and I agree that the papers go too far in their attempt to sell to a public which has an insatiable appetite for dubious scandal. But when the police are desperately seeking a criminal - or in this case, desperately seeking a five-year-old girl who has been missing for days - it's down to the meeja to get the necessary information into the public domain.",0,1349301306,null,0,false,0,c6h7umu,t3_10w7dd,t1_c6h7umu,t3_10w7dd,null,1430056869,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Test out the ISP's in your area and figure out which one offers you the fastest connection. The fastest connection in the UK atm is offered by Virgin Media (if youre in there selected areas) and it's 100Mb. Soon to raise too 120Mb. My personal experience is Virgin normally offer the fastest connection speeds, but like I said this will not be the case for everybody.

On his first point, he is going around in circles. Earlier in the article he goes through the logic of players going down when lightly fouled calling it ""the sensible thing"" to do. Just in the previous paragraph he demonstrates how it is possible for a defender to foul an attacker just enough to knock him off the ball, without the ref seeing a foul. So, what he wants to see is referees call the fouls they don't see, before the player goes to ground - thus making sure the ref sees - because players know how to foul a player just enough with out the referee noticing and it's not getting called.

No, if you want to address anything with how the officials are calling the game, it should be to put more training and focus into distinguishing a dive from going down, and to better notice these surgical fouls. Or add more officials that are also better trained. Personally, I'm all for making the new goal line officials a roaming official, that like the two linesman, that stick to one half but also have the power to stop the match like the center ref.

The video analysis however, I'm all for. However, I don't agree with the issuing of cards as, from Law 12 a yellow or red card ""is used to communicate that a *player*, *substitute* or *substituted player*"" has been cautioned or sent off.

And that's not the point. Even if that was the case, Amy had no reason to actually think the Angel would take her to the same time and place as Rory. If the Doctor tells her it will, then Moffat is breaking his own rule of ""The Doctor Lies."" If he tells her it won't, then it seems hardly reasonable that she would choose to live the rest of her life possibly without her family or Rory.

The ending would have been much more dramatic if something had happened: if Amy had killed herself, it the Angel had killed Rory, whatever, just anything more surprising and permanent than the nebulous, ""They travel into the past and live happily every after."" Do the last four words sound a bit storybook? That's because the ending is essentially formulaic.

true,syntax,cnty-scotland,Stravaigin,"Well, every month is movember for me.  Testicular cancer survivor (so far), so the beard is there as a note that chemo's not got it yet.

Speaking of which, whilst I've got your attention:  Testicular cancer is actually quite rare (2500 cases a year, or so), but it is unusual in two respects.  Firstly, it's pretty much the most survivable of all cancers, and secondly: it is most common in men aged 25-34 (this probably contributes to the survability compared to the cancers that strike in old age).

So, if you are a man aged 25-34, you should know the risk factors.  

The key thing to know is that a tumor is a small, hard, lump that cannot be moved independant of the testicle.  If you get one of those, get thee to the GP, now!  Do not worry about wasting their time - the way the stats work out, if every man went on a hair trigger for testicular oddities, it would take the NHS less time total, after accounting for the false alarms.  (A false alarm here is easy for a GP to spot, and early detection makes a huge difference to the difficulty of treatment).

The stats is roughly one man in 200 or so, but it's not uniform.  If you have had an undescended teste (even if corrected decades ago), or one testicle is smaller than the other, then the risk rises, quite considerably.  This is under-appreciated, but aught to be better known.  This refers primarily to a type of cancer called a seminoma. 

There is another class of testicular cancer, called a teratoma.  These can actually start when still in the womb, and are the primary mode in younger men.  (There's yet another class, but it's really rare, even on the scale of rare things.  It behaves quite differently, however.).

Anyway, if you have a wee lump, get the to the GP.  Do not worry about chemo or radio therapy.  For one, if you get it early (stage 1-2), then the majority of cancers are sucessfully treated by surgical methods alone, and then the other options are kept in reserve in case of discovering a later metastasis.  If it's not found till later (stage 3-4), then you're much more likely to have to get chemo.  Chemo is remarkably effective against testicular cancers, so it's short if needed.


Prostate cancer is something I've no direct experience of; but that's not too surprising, as it's one that affects older men more than younger. The chances of getting it rise after age 50, and pretty much keep rising as one gets older.  The 5 year survival rate is 80ish %, although do place that in the context of older men.  Part of the problem is that it can often have no symptoms until somewhat advanced.

Do note, however, that more men die _with_ prostate cancer than die _of_ it - that's a direct consequence of it affecting older men.

The key symptom is urinary disfunction - if you can't pee right, get thee to the GP!

true,widgetas,null,null,"I've personally never liked the guy: Creepy looking, weird, not funny etc. etc. However I should be clear that has *nothing* to do with the allegations, it's just a fact that clouds my judgement/feelings. It's easy to conclude one way or the other after the event, of course. I knew a guy who it turned out had been buying child porn over the web - essentially he was (one of the people) that was keeping child abuse going as it was 'made to order' as it were.

After he was convicted people said ""Yeah I always knew there was something weird about him."" Now people might say things like that to make themselves feel better (I ain't a psychologist), and I imagine that pretty much anyone can be brought down in this way. 

Mind you, when it comes to people like Savile who are ""national treasures"" and major fund raisers for charity etc. there seems to be an element of ""Oh no they couldn't possibly do something like that!""

Imagine if Brucie was accused of something similar, while he's alive. The noise made by those who could 'never comprehend that he might do something like that' would imply that most people think that way. And I think that contributes to the reasons people didn't come forward before now. I have to say though that I was shocked as to how many staff/colleagues essentially ignored it. That's pretty screwy - I've not really heard a decent reason as to why, but of course who would want to take the first step? He knew *everyone*... fear I suppose.

The allegations don't shock me, however I think that might be partially due to the reason I raised at the beginning: I thought he was a weirdo. Paedos are also weirdos. Therefore... No, that's not a good line of argumentation.

Incidentally, I also do not favour Nicholas Parsons, Lionel Blair or David Dickinson. And I never liked Gary Glitter. Who knows, I might have a peado-dar.

true,[deleted],null,null,"So, the evidence is that The Doctor was emotionally off-balance? Couldn't that be a result of faking his death, and knocking about on his own for a little while afterwards when everyone still thought he was dead, before starting to do things with the Williams again? 

What you offer is possible (if you believe that Amy's Last Farewell means only that Amy can never see the Doctor after TATM, but not that The Doctor can never see Amy after TATM). But The Doctor's changes in mood do not necessitate the events of TATM occurring prior to the rest of the season in The Doctor's timeline. (This ignores the fact that The Doctor did not intend to meet up with Amy/Rory in Ep 1, but the Daleks kidnapped all three of them, separately.)

Also, I feel like if it is the case that The Doctor in the first 4 episodes had already experienced TATM, there would be some concrete evidence. Like during the Crash of the Byzantium, when the Doctor goes back from the final episode, there is a change in wardrobe.

EDIT: In The Power of Three, The Doctor does say that he misses her. This could be taken to imply that The Doctor had at that point already experienced TATM. But, Amy and Rory had also already said that they had been seeing The Doctor less and less, and thought that perhaps he was trying to wean them off of him. So, that tells us that The Doctor hasn't been seeing them very often, and that could also explain why The Doctor said that he misses them.

Also of note, the outfit The Doctor is wearing at the end of The Power of Three is the same as the outfit he is wearing throughout TATM. But this outfit is different than the one he is wearing at the beginning of The Power of Three. Far from definitive, but that suggests Power of Three could be just before TATM.

EDIT2: Near the beginning of Dinosaurs On A Spaceship, Amy comments ""hellooo, ten months?"", to which The Doctor responds with an excuse, which I take to mean that Amy/Rory hadn't seen The Doctor for 10 months.

And then you have that moment at the end, the surprise, that haunting music spun up.....it made me gasp the first time.  It opened up hope and ideas for the whole next season.

This is a fair point, but the line of reasoning has to end somewhere. For instance, it will soon be technically trivial for the government to record locations for all mobile phones on a database. If there was a mugging, they could go back and find everyone who was in the area at the time, ask them if they saw anything, and reconstruct the crime. But would we be willing to allow this because it reduces crime, given the civil liberties implications? It would mean that any group of individuals could be found anywhere in the country at a moments notice, and arrested within the hour.

Or, for instance, the government could record all websites that people visit, and comb through the information for people visiting jihadi websites. But they could use the same mechanism for mapping out activist networks, or someone could use the information to blackmail a politician. What would Boris Johnson do to avoid disclosure of the particular porn videos that he randomly watched at such and such a time soon after a tragic event?

I realize that the episode had to happen because we had to be introduced to the chameleon arch because of the Master's return at the end of the season, but why did we need two episodes to introduce such a simple concept? Especially when those two episodes were boring as hell, and had NO payoff. We have to sit through 90 minutes of whiny, mopey Doctor crying about how he doesn't want to die. You're not going to die, you idiot. You'll still have all of your memories of everything that's happened, the only difference is you'll actually have a fucking clue about how to save everyone. 

Through all of this, he just cries, and mopes, and feels sorry for himself, and treats Martha like shit. I've never been a huge fan of Martha, but he was a real asshole to her in those episodes, and it was really annoying to watch. The only thing that got me through both episodes was the thought that the Doctor would come back and be a badass and kill the aliens and it would all be worth it. Instead, we just get a recap from the son saying, ""Yeah, he beat us, we shouldn't have messed with him."" With a conclusion like that, I could have just looked up the ending and been given the same amount of information. It's not like we actually got to see what he did. We just get the assurance that he definitely did something.

""Oh, your sister got stuck in a mirror for eternity? Well that sure is an interesting thing and sounds like a complicated thing to do. How exactly did he pull that off? I would love to know."" Nope. No idea how that happened. We just know that it did. Two episodes of unbearable human Doctor sobbing about how much his life sucks, and all we get in the end is, ""The Doctor won. Just trust me on this.""

true,chimpwithalimp,lfc68,,"Fergie has been the manager there for 20+ years, so probably it's just him. However, you can't underestimate his corrupting influence. I don't mean that in a legal way, but more as a power to disrupt others and get his own way. The press won't touch him, in fact the opposite is true. You'll barely hear a bad word against him. Sometimes after a terrible decision in Uniteds favour, you'll be hard pressed to see anything significant written about it. It'll say *""United were fortuitously awarded a penalty when Danny Welbeck was adjudged to be taken down by the goalkeeper""*, instead of the more accurate *""Welbeck won a penalty which under video replay was found to be completely incorrect, making that the seventh dubious penalty this year that United have been awarded""* (For example).

SAF has been around so long that he has ties to a lot of clubs. For example, several managers are his ex-players and ex-colleagues. That's not to say they'll take it easy on him, but who knows. Imagine if Gary Neville got into managing this year. Can you picture him doing 100% everything he can to defeat Man United? Never.

Its also a recognisable trend that United get assigned referees that are seen to be quite pro-United. That's covered in the blog you posted. Rafa Benitez covered a lot of other things, like the fact United seem to get sunday games so they have the maximum amount of time to recover between matches.

The Fergie time stuff is also well understood. The fourth official holds up the board saying there'll be three minutes added on, and United score the equaliser or winner after six minutes of over time.

Basically, its a lot of small advantages and unusual circumstances which overall do seem to add up to a recognisable advantage to Man United. If a team is playing them in Old Trafford, I wouldn't be surprised if the pre-match team talk for the opposition is to expect a penalty against them, expect a red card, and work from that game plan.

As the season has gone on I've learned more and more about him. He is an extremely confident and selfless player. He understands his amazing potential and wants to be the best player in the world, but by no means is he ""cocky"" like the media says. 
After watching the Champions League final last season he realized Chelsea only really had Juan Mata as a play-maker. Now he wants to be the player the fans love and set records and win silverware. 

 IF Chelsea were to sell him I think Real Madrid or Manchester City would be the only teams Hazard would agree with going to. He of course would want money but they are also from the top 2 leagues in the world IMO. I don't think PSG or a Russian sides money would be enough to capture him because he wants the challenge of playing in the EPL or La Liga.

What would be very cool is using the old doctors that are still alive and interacting with them in some way or another.

true,LittleAvatarEyes,null,null,"I think we are really missing Barry in the midfield. I think Garcia and Rodwell are both good players but to play good flowing football there needs to be that midfielder who receives the ball from the defense, turns, and distributes forwards. They can pass alright but from what I've seen neither has the vision to really open up play with their distribution. Yaya can do it when the ball comes to him but he is best suited staying in the middle and doing a little bit of everything from defending, to distributing, to making marauding forward runs, to scoring goals. We need a player who will consistently play the right ball forward to one of our many creative options. Without this, a gap has developed between our offense and defense that is forcing us to either force the ball up the wing or play a long ball forward. We don't play the ball up the wing well because silva and nasri both like to cut inside which is fine but since everyone we have likes to stay relatively central (besides tevez) we get jammed up and need that workhorse mid to a provide a safe passing option and then restart the attack in a different area of the pitch to open up space. We are also too small to play as many long balls forward as we have. Dzeko is really the only forward player we have who can play this style and he has saved us multiple times this year. I think Clichy has been fine but he is abysmal at crossing and he hasnt had enough space when hes on the ball to do much. Our right backs have been weak tho. Zaba kept getting way to forward against Real which led to their final goal and Maicon was brought in to play when we use a 3 back formation but has had to play in the back 4 because we are missing Richards. I also think that Lescott is too slow to play against the better teams we play and Nastasic is going to be sick but is really young to be starting Champions League matches against the likes of Real and Dortmund.

Alternate (AKA Better, AKA According to the book) Ending: [Zombies invade. Leader throws himself at the glass. Will Smith sees a butterfly tattoo on the neck of the zombie girl he just ""cured."" Realizes that the zombies are only invading to save the girl that he basically kidnapped. Injects zombie girl with the virus to uncure her, opens the glass and pushes the gurney out to the leader. Leader screams in his face, takes the girl, and leaves. Will Smith learns that they aren't just mindless rage machines; they're actually intelligent. Hence why the leader zombie almost burns himself trying to save the girl when Will Smith kidnaps her in the first place. Hence why Smith gets trapped in a clever snare set by leader. Hence why the title is freaking called *I Am Legend* in the first place because Smith realizes that he is a *legend* among the zombies, like the boogyman is one of our legends, kidnapping them in the ""night,"" taking them away, and killing them. It's all about ""who is the real monster in this film"" and has nothing to do with the lukewarm, rehashed ""Blarg, zombies bad! Humans good!"" fodder of the theatrical release ending.](/spoiler)

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"I'm not quick to jump on the conspiracy train but it's quite interesting and I wish some more research would be done to investigate this. Doubtful the FA would be very interested in seeing a more in-depth look at this.

One person in [the comments section](http://diminbeirut.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/10/corruption-and-influence-peddling-in-the-english-game.html?cid=6a01630241df75970d017ee3ee925f970d#comment-6a01630241df75970d017ee3ee925f970d) of that blog post brought up some interesting points:

* The person suggests that a better way to research this would be to investigate how many of these penalties were awarded correctly or not.

* He also states that Man U - as an attacking club - generally spends more time in the opposition's area, thus, creating more chances to be awarded a penalty.

* He brings up the point that in the last 10 years, United have only been awarded 5 more penalties than us.

But on the surface, yes, it really does seem pretty clear that Manchester United get more injury time, that the penalties that they do receive seem to come at an awfully convenient time.

But I suppose my question is if Manchester United (i.e. Sir Alex Ferguson) *is* influencing the refs to gain penalties and extra time, **how** are they doing it?

Is Ferguson paying off refs? Is he paying off the FA? Is the mere threat of not being assigned to a future United match enough for a ref to continue to award penalties to United? (Perhaps Ferguson has enough power/reach to influence non-United assignments for refs).

a club like that cannot have such a terrible black-mark on it. imagine the humility after all the moral high-ground of the english media whenever similar scandals occurred in foreign leagues. it would be an assault on england itself, and that must never happen to the isle that created the game.

Restaurants have the right to refuse to serve people, the manager even allowed them to finish their paid for buffet before telling them he didn't want them to come back.

either way, Midnight was probably my favorite episode. That and Blink are tied I would say. Both episodes don't necessarily add to the plot, but that doesn't make them bad at all.

with the logic you've presented for your dislike of midnight, then you must hate Blink as well, since it hardly has the doctor in it.

Part of the reason I enjoy these episodes so much is because they're good on their own, you don't need a back story, you can just dive right in. They're my go-to episodes for introducing people to Dr. Who. 

another reason I enjoyed Midnight is because it shows the doctor as truly vulnerable. He was nearly killed that episode, and He was completely terrified.

true,sm9t8,eng-somerset,Somerset,"Sikorski is actually a member of a Eurosceptic party, although one that practices soft Euroscepticism. In contrast the position of British Eurosceptics has hardened. 

To clarify:

* Soft Euroscepticism is the opposition to the EU becoming a federal nation in it's own right.

* Hard Euroscepticism is the opposition of membership of the EU.

Eurosceptics in Britain were once predominantly soft, they've become hard as they've become to believe a Federal Europe is an inevitability they can't halt. 

Sikorski wants Britain to act as a counterweight to Germany in negotiations. This is the kind of counterweight politics Hard Eurosceptics have grown tired of. EU federalists never loose a battle in European politics, they're only delayed as Eurosceptics force a compromise.

The problem is if you compromise between a position of movement or no-movement the result is some movement. This is why a Federal Europe is an inevitability. This is why Hard-Euroscepticism exists.

In this case, we have Amy writing an afterword at the end of her Doctor-free life saying goodbye to him.  Since he can't go back and change this without creating a paradox (Earth go BOOM), then that's the end for them, their story is as over as it possibly could be given the get out clause in my first paragraph.

Now, as I said, there's always ways out of it, but I think the only way that'd work is that Amy's afterword was a total lie, and that any she ignored any further adventures they had together.  

The problem with doing this is that it makes no character sense whatsoever, and entirely negates the emotional significance of the perfectly crafted ending to the story that happened in the last episode, so that the continuation of the Pond's story would instantly render the writer of said story an integrity-free hack.
