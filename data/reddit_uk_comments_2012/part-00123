While we should rightly anticipate a flurry of goals or at least outscoring our opponents in every match, especially given our possession, it isnt happening.

Ohhhhh Rose. Collarbones.

Creepy dead lady is creepy as heck, man! 

He's six years and half a continent off this time.

Also, chloroform was much more available. It is much much more difficult to obtain it nowadays...not that I've tried. Um.

Rose is 19? Forgot that.

She has also not seen enough zombie movies to know what to do in this situation. Pottery is not enough. Apparently one must engage these ones in conversation. She even calls them zombies! Give Rose a machete.

Gwen's psychic stuff works on the Doctor? Unusual, that.

""What's the Rift?"" ""Queer feeling like a shadow passing over your soul"" [spoiler](#s ""whaaaaaat? Here? Already? No?!? Freaking out here."")

Rose is widening her perceptions again. ""Maybe I am (a wild thing), maybe that's a good thing"" [spoiler](#s ""maybe she's a bad wolf..."")

I do like psychic Gwen. [spoiler](#s ""the big bad wolf! We should include this as a game, spot the bad wolf in every episode"")

I do like Dickens' concise summary of the situation. Rose is having her preconceptions adjusted again!

Security for the olympics as a whole cost £X (whether that's more or less than the money G4S agreed is neither here nor there).

If G4S are expected to meet this cost in its entirety - including paying for the army to come in where they couldn't - then arguably, they should receive 100% of what they negotiated and then make a payment back to the government of the amount it cost to bring in the army. Essentially taking money off LOCOG to give to the army.

If the government wish to deduct the amount it cost to bring in the army from the amount they pay G4S (which I can fully understand), then G4S shouldn't be expected to make a subsequent payment for this cost because it's already been deducted from their invoice.

(FWIW I agree that deducting the money from the payment given to G4S makes more sense because as a taxpayer, I'd rather G4S was suing the government for the payment than the government suing G4S to pay the army like they said they would. Much easier to get the money out of someone when you never gave it to them in the first place!)",0,1347438562,null,0,false,0,c670wub,t3_zpgid,t1_c670wub,t1_c66sno5,null,1429879038,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

And we're paying for it now in our lack of energy security.

As you say, she closed profitable mines, which made no sense other than to completely destroy mining in the UK.

She was behind the ""dash for gas"", opening up power stations fueled by gas and closing coal powered ones.  The interesting thing about that is, the chairman of British Gas openly opposed this policy. 

He said it wasn't sustainable - we had over 100 years domestic gas supply left, or about 20-30 years if we burned it for electricity.  In 1986 he predicted what is reality now - high domestic gas prices because we now rely on foreign gas for both domestic and power. The only way the policy  made sense is if it was attempt to remove the main purchaser of UK coal - the power stations.

Have a read up on Sir Dennis Rooke, if you want to learn more.

As for consensus on her economic reforms - you have to remember, tories are tories, Major wasn't going to steer the ship any other way. 

Labour was out of power for 18 years. By the time they had an opportunity to do anything, they'd had to swing right just to get elected. 18 years with one clear message being hammered home, supported by the press can do a lot to change the general public's mindset, her policies brought about prosperity which of course helped!

But I don't know if her economic reforms were all necessary or good. Look at Norway for an independent energy rich nation with an excellent social framework.  Or look at how Iceland has recovered from the crash.  It's clear we had other options in the 1980s that could still have led to prosperity.

Because it would still be expensive if it was nationalised but the cost would hit us differently and it would be a much worse service. I think we should regulate the industry more heavily to restrict bad practice but overall I think trains in the UK more accurately reflect their cost to the user as they're not as subsidised as EU trains.


Water could be opened up in the same way the energy market is by having a distribution company and then water producers/cleaners. I could then buy services from any water company even if the individual molecules of water had come from another company. In the same way that the electricity I get may not have been generated by nPower but they're the people I pay.

You'd then have a good reason for clamping down on leaking pipes as the water companies would have an incentive to sue the distribution company for losing their precious product.

The energy industry reacts quickly to consumer demand, look at the rise of green/blue tariffs and online payments. The dash for gas in the early 90s allowed private investors to build new and efficient combined cycle plants and worked in partnership with other privatised entities.

Poor students don't get only grants BTW, they still have loans. I was entitled to the maximum amount of grants since I came from a single parent home with an annual income of &lt;£16k. And they're not 'huge' either - they're no more than the maximum loan amount which students from more priviliged backgrounds are given the option of taking. Some unis offer means tested bursaries, but this can vary by institution.

A year after graduation, I still owe £20k~ to the SLC, despite working a 25 hour part time week for the entirety of my course. My mum is in no position to help me pay that off, or to help me with a deposit on a house - in fact, as she is disabled I regularly used parts of my loan to support her (e.g. I bought her a new washing machine when her 15 year old one broke down beyond repair). 

Students from wealthier backgrounds go back to more affluent areas after graduation, likely with better employment rates. In these areas they'll enjoy generally better standards of living, and can expect financial support from parents which allows them to pursue post-graduation opportunities like unpaid internships (a necessity to get a graduate role now in many fields). They may also receive help with things like a deposit for buying their first property. Poor students get little of this. How is their 'finish line' any closer?

&gt;It seems greatly unfair that we should all be given the same start line

We're not though.

Trying again; So glad you've kept this account alive Dave! and also glad to hear your POV - If you're ever in Belfast again, I'd still like to grab you that beer if you're available any time soon! =D

I agree - I do hope we see a lot of leavers. IMO Unionism is stagnating under the DUP who are still so heavily traditionalist, and has no direction under the UUP. 

Nesbitt's landslide victory for the leadership of the party was mostly from his support of the traditional element. He'd networked well during Tom Elliot's campaign with this side on the ground, and convinced the elective that he was the same beast with more polish and media training. However, the critical mistake he's made was in his assumption that his leadership would get rebellious members in line;

&gt;The problem is that there is no sign of the better policies, better organisation, or the better communications.

&gt;Indeed, an opinion poll in the Belfast Telegraph last week put the UUP – at 11% – on its lowest-ever level of support.

&gt;One bad news story has followed another and, last Friday, the party’s officers actually over-ruled Nesbitt’s public call for an executive meeting to discuss the Maginnis debacle, then made matters worse by issuing a statement which didn’t even come close to criticising the peer.

&gt;It was an embarrassing and humiliating setback for Nesbitt. Ironically (albeit very typical of the UUP), **[he didn’t have the power to call the meeting, he didn’t have the approval from those who did have the power and, consequently, he should not have contacted the media to tell them he was calling the meeting](http://sluggerotoole.com/2012/06/22/as-the-uup-continues-its-long-gentle-journey-downwards/)**.

&gt;In essence, he was breaching the very rules he has criticized others of breaching. Hmm: only the UUP. 

&gt;(Alex Kane, BelTel)

Right now, I'd speculate that Nesbitt's views on things such as education (among others) are causing internal backbiting. In the past, the party has maintained a very strictly open view on segregated schooling to accommodate all of it's members. With a fairly large blend of modernist to traditionalist, sitting on the fence with the desire to ""protect parental choice"" kept everyone happy. Now Nesbitt has made a [more economically favourable choice from the Government's view point](http://sluggerotoole.com/2012/06/21/uup-leader-calling-for-parents-that-send-children-to-faith-schools-to-pay-twice/), he's no doubt just ruffled more feathers... I'll be keen to see how it plays out, as this might be a baseline for the struggle to sort itself from.

The liberal party member's I've spoken to, fear that a move towards more liberal social views and otherwise will make them too like the Alliance party to the voter. I think this could still be a massive setback - but if Nesbitt continues to support moves like integrated schooling, it'll either inspire loyalty which might eradicate that fear, or just continue to confuse the voter and see more members jumping ship. 

I think that hoping for a final revelation within the party in choosing it's direction, won't ever happen - because as you say - it's all a bit of a far stretch. The UUP never seems to know what it is, or what it wants - often I've heard this proclaimed as a benefit, as they can ""embrace"" a wide range of views. However this seems to fly very rightly in the face of any real progress because the party can't agree on anything.

The TUV definitely doesn't ring well to the traditional's in the UUP. Having met a number of the YUUP collective and speaking with them on this, they all reject the TUV resolutely, but nevertheless there is oddly many traditionalists at the younger levels as well as the top. The Party seems very clearly split, and as such, doesn't seem to represent their members at all because of this. I actually mistakenly turned one member into an Alliance support once LOL as I explained how their views struck me more as Alliance than UUP.

I think there's plenty of UUP members in just that position - I just think they need to realise it. I'm not sure about the Alliance myself, as the most socially liberal and [honest](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/education/education-committee-lsquofailing-to-make-gradersquo-15140234.html), I find them really appealing but I don't know how they stand on more issues than that! However, if the socially considerate/liberal element is attractive, then you're more likely to see progress in the stronger numbers and direction within this party. 

At present though I believe that - at this stage anyway - the UUP have no recourse. Nesbitt will have to chose his stance and stick at it. The UUP have constantly been criticized on their [lack of definitive policy plenty in the past](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00b99lc) - and have been again above.

Whispering within the Party assure me that very controversial issues such as sexual reproductive rights or even just equal marriage rights will be debated issues as the UUP will never approach for these due to their vast range of views. I've been given the impression such conversations could tear the party apart. 

So in summary; With all this confusion and lack of direction, I don't think the public are likely to see any clear policy coming out of the UUP. The longer this continues, the more the split will continue to wreak havoc; Modernists continue to lose faith in the parties ability to modernise - traditionalist don't see enough backbone and are flocking to the DUP. Despite an entire division devoted to engaging women, Paula Bradshaw among others have been driven out of the party due to it's remarkable sexism (and I've seen that again and again at the younger levels). 

Pros: Perhaps the Alliance will gain more clout to modernising social issues.

Con: We could see the DUP gaining traditionalism momentum as this all plays out....

Let's just hope enough young people haven't been driven out of politics all together by the time we see these shifts play out, so we can actually try to get NI out of the blood dark ages...!

There are fewer liberals in the DUP than UUP in my experience - so it's more a dirty little secret badly kept from the public eye more than anything else. The DUP are staunchly traditional on the social liberation front. Even Nelson has been honoured with a second Ministerial post after his 'creationism in the Ulster Museum' rampage. He's not going anywhere soon.

Even the Junior Minister to Peter Robinson, Jonathan Bell, is a card carrying member of the Caleb foundation. As is [Gregory Campbell - who went from Minister to MP and voted Pro-Capital Punishment... alongside his leader within his first year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Campbell_(politician)). These guys seem to actually be accumulating political clout via the DUP - and not many else.

This is incorrect.

Thus, the median would remain unchanged, and nobody would fall under poverty under this definition.

In my own little fanfic, there's an episode where the 'reverse' on the TARDIS gets stuck, and the Doctor is forced to go forwards in time until all that's left is void after the heat death of the universe.  The Doctor is left to drift about in emptiness until he eventually collides with the Face of Boe, also drifting around in the nothingness, waking him up from this nap.  Through some super science, the polarity of the neutron flow is reversed and Jack reverts back to the young studly form we all recognize.  They then use his time-bracelet to fix the TARDIS and proceed to have some adventures.

No it isn't.

Hypothetically it would be possible for a poor person to have £50,000 a year in income and still be classed as poor when calculated on an equality basis if the rest of the UK was even richer.

No sane person would claim they are poor, or that income inequality is a problem - but people keep going on about it.

Income inequality is an issue of being poorer than other people - not being poor in absolute terms.

That is why I think it is good and desirable to assist those who are genuinely poor in absolute terms - but throwing money at people who can afford to buy computer games and new clothes on a regular basis is a daft idea.

More effort also needs to go into education, and that needs not more money, but more experimentation and higher standards so that people are not left at 16 with either the choice of flipping burgers or university because their secondary qualifications are worthless.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Yeah, but the vast majority relied on BT's infrastructure.

It doesn't matter. The bits of BT's network that they are using are heavily price regulated and don't affect the quality of service (to any great extent, most of the time). The key bit is that it eventually gets connected to someone else's network, i.e. an ISP's own network, and that really does affect the quality of service.

If they use LLU, as some ISPs do, then the only bit they are using is a bit of copper wire that BT happen to own.

&gt; Cable And Wireless was also privatised, the same time as BT, and so provided some level of competition (later as NTL, then Virgin)

You're only thinking of the few years that Cable and Wireless owned a cable television franchise - they've been around far longer than that (their business was all of those cables we laid to talk to the Empire) and was involved in far more than cable TV.

&gt; But really there were and still are only 2 major competitors (if you're still paying line rental to BT, it's not a huge difference).

I still disagree. Just because a company uses bits of BT's infrastructure, it does not eliminate them as a competitor. Virgin/NTL/Telewest were not BT's first competitor and they are not their only competitor.",0,1347450542,null,0,false,0,c67206y,t3_zpo1e,t1_c67206y,t1_c671uol,null,1429879552,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

A human (or other multi-cellular organism) is made up of many cells, mutations that are passed on to your kids can only come from ""germline"" mutations, i.e. mutations in your testicles or ovaries, which means your eggs/sperm will be have slight changes, and so your kids will have them.

The rest of your body's cells are called ""somatic cells"", and mutations found here do not get passed down to your offspring... but they still happen.

Usually, when a cell gets a mutation (Substitution, Insertion, or deletion of DNA - doesn't matter which, for my point, they're all similar), it is a fatal mutation. e.g. if a gene that codes for something the cell needs gets broken, then the cell dies. If a gene that regulates proteins breaks, and and the cell makes too many, it might die, etc etc.

Most mutations just make the cell die.

Some mutations have no effect, they might happen in non-coding areas, or, more often than not, they will cause a gene to code for the exact same protein. (Due to DNA-&gt;amino-acid coding redundancies... 64 possible combinations code for 20 proteins + 3 stop signals + 1 start)

And finally... Some mutations cause a cell to grow more than it's neighbours. The mutation might make the cell more efficient. The cell might absorb nutrients faster. Maybe the mutation will make the cell might grow bigger and might divide more often? Unfortunately the most common way a mutation will cause a cell to stand out from it's sisters... is to stop the cell dying. Because you see, cells have pre-programmed self-destruct buttons, these are used to nicely and cleanly break up a cell to recycle it's parts, especially in the case of something like a gene being broken. When cells can't self-destruct, they can easily grow out of control, and this is known as cancer.

Anyway, **tl;dr Your own cells compete against each other the same way individuals compete against each other and your body actually does evolve a little bit over time, with stronger cells with more competitive/advantageous somatic mutations out-living weaker cells without such mutations.**

Citation? And not *that* YouTube video please!

Plus, as is a must when someone says ""But tourists!"", do you think that if the royals were removed then tourism would cease? What about everything outside of London? What about everything *in* London that isn't directly related to the royals? What about everything in London that wouldn't be lost if the royals weren't there anymore?

The only thing I can think of in London that people would likely come and look at *because* there might be a queen inside is Buckingham Palace. However, if Lizzy etc. were dropped, then far more of the palace could be opened to visitors. No net loss, even if there is a drop in visitors - they'd pay more to see more? As an example of somewhere with no royals but still gets visitors: The Tower of London. No royals there for centuries, but it's a must on most tourist trails. Tower Bridge, HMS Belfast, The Eye, Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey. St Pauls, The Shard (soon)... How much more?

If you can think of other areas that might lose people let me know. But in any case I'm fairly sure that the British Tourism Board (or whoever does that kinda thang) will be fairly swift to big up others areas of Britain to tourists in an attempt to ensure that we don't lose visitors.

As a final sneaky ""Fnah!"": Consider France. Got rid of their royal family (essentially) but they're not exactly effed on the tourism front. Yes, I realise that they did that a long time ago and they have x, y and z, but it undermines the argument that a royal family is that important, I think.",0,1347454566,null,0,false,0,c672kd0,t3_zq2ch,t1_c672kd0,t1_c67135u,null,1429879828,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

So I would agree that sex before marriage has nothing to do with ethics. But if you're still talking about morals, then I'm not sure I agree... whether or not sex before marriage is immoral is subjective too. I mean going by the definition of ""moral"" these things do fall under it.

However I'm not arguing that they should be included in a sensible moral code at all - I would consider such things a waste of time writing into a moral code because they are so irrelevant.

I should stress the direction I was coming from was a secular one and was *not* being Islamophobic as I made that very clear in the text. It's very frustrating that conversations about Islam can often be one extreme or the other: EDL-ish or ""You're being Islamophobic"". Yes of course there are discussions in between, but on important issues they seem to be getting rarer. 

The One-Law-For-All campaign has had this problem at protests: Anti-facists siding with Muslims against them while the EDL try and join their ranks.

true,87liyamu,uk,North-East Derbyshire,"The median can actually be a useful indicator, as it's less susceptible to the kinds of distortion that affect the mean and the mode. [This sample graph](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Comparison_mean_median_mode.svg/512px-Comparison_mean_median_mode.svg.png) from Wikipedia shows how the median can remain quite still, while the figures around it move quite significantly. 

According to [this YouTube video from the Office for National Statistics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRN5_sDA0oI), the UK Median income is determined to be £14,700, and a household that is earning less than 60% of the median (that is, less than £8,800) is considered to be in poverty. In 2010, this equated to 17.1% of the population, or 10.7 million people. The rest of the video is quite interesting if you're a fan of statistics. [This graph](http://i.imgur.com/pBVKn.png) does a good job of showing how falling incomes can result in falling poverty rates (2008/09).

I agree that poverty would be much better defined as a set of ""minimum standards"" than as a median-percentage. I don't envy the politician who would have to sell that idea, though. Changing the definition of things like poverty can very easily be attacked by the opposition as ""fudging the figures"" if it brings the poverty rate down, while a redefinition that brings the poverty rate up would be jumped on by the Opposition.",0,1347455892,null,0,false,0,c672t2a,t3_zrasm,t1_c672t2a,t1_c6718mt,null,1429879937,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

However, that process makes a number of other things harder.  For example, if a student goes to work for a year, _then_ decides to go to university, how do you compare what their grades are to the current years?

What is the signal that some year grouping is not as high performing as last year, so that the first year courses can be scaled a little?  At the moment, if the admissions officers have to lower the grades accepted to get in, then that's the clear signal to all involved.  


This is all assuming that the Universities are the primary and sole user of school results.  I do not believe that this is true.

If you run a business, and you have applicants all with high school qualifications, but over a 10 year period (not too unusual), how to you pick the one with the 'best' grades?  By throwing away a comparision point across different diets, it is possible that an 'A' in one year is the same as 'B' in another, and an 'A*' in a third year.

Yes, by my own press, by my country's own standards Britain was falling way behind the rest of Europe in 1979.

&gt;And that is why we saw GDP fall in relation to France, Germany and Italy between 79 and 83 while there's grew our's dropped. Thatchers failed financial policies did that, she was good at rhetoric very poor at managing the economy.

Inflation happened under Jim Callaghan!

You're literally rewriting history.  You've completely got the timeframe wrong.  Callaghan himself had to ask for US help to persuade the IMF to lend the UK money in 1976.  The Winter of Discontent was in 1978-79.   The economy started to improve when Thatcher came into power, and more over to address the oil price argument, only now did the UK begin to pull ground back on Europe who were undergoing the same oil prices.

&gt;No the oil price dropped dramatically. Nothing Thatcher did up to that point had an impact in fact what she was getting up to was harming the economy. Graph above.

Britain was swamped with inflation.  She increased interest rates and brought it back under control.  She increased taxes under the 1980 recession - unpopular but brought spending under control.  In two years she'd more than halved inflation from 18%.  That in itself has nothing to do with oil.

&gt;Oh keep telling yourself this rubbish. A strike doesnt impact GDP for three years. These were excuses. Bullshit. Fabrications. Lies.

It does when they are a season of strikes which mean there are power cuts and lines of commerce are broken when lorry drivers are striking.

It absolutely does.  

You just threw out most of the 1970s and why people actually employ the strike.

It's the same fuel prices across Europe, only when they were high the UK suffered worse than most, if not all.  When they came back down and when Thatcher was in charge suddenly the UK became one of the top flight.

&gt;The same happened to the car industry in the US.

We were importing coal back in 1980!  Reserves were running down, mines were already closing, and the coal on our own doorstep was becoming hugely inefficient.

&gt;Basically the Poll Tax effectively doubled the rates bill for most households overnight.

Because basically most people weren't contributing to rates at all, which is exactly why the Poll Tax was introduced but so ineffectual.

&gt;We've gone from being completely self reliant for power to relying on Russia to keep the lights on.

Not even close - and the lights were hardly on when we relied on the miners either.  Look at the 3 day week for gawd's sake!!!

true,widgetas,null,null,"History of marriage in the UK time! A few brief instances of law that I like to bring up:

Marriage Act 1753 - At this point the only marriages recognised as legal in the UK were those performed by a CoE minister in a CoE church. Anyone can have a ceremony anywhere they like (i.e. in a Catholic church), but for it to be recognised by the government then they have to re-do it in an Anglican ceremony. (Jews &amp; Quakers are exempt from this). Essentially *all* (but a tiny fraction) of marriages are performed as Anglican/the state religion ceremonies. 

Marriage Act 1836 (that would be more than 175 years ago) - The restriction on the ceremony being Anglican is lifted. Other religions can perform state recognised marriages, so long as the priest etc. is registered as a licensed practitioner etc. Importantly: non-religious ceremonies are made legal. People can get married in registry offices in entirely secular ceremonies.

TL;DR - Marriage has not always been religious in the UK though at one point religious marriages were essentially *forced* upon the population. Nearly two centuries ago secular ceremonies were (re-?) legalised/recognised.

TL;DR, TL;DR - Marriage is not an exclusively religious institution - not anymore, even if it ever was really. In fact in Scotland, for example, [secular ceremonies outnumber religious ceremonies.](http://www.humanism-scotland.org.uk/news/in_the_news/demand_for_secular_ceremonies_creates_shortage_of_humanist_celebrants/)",0,1347457473,null,0,false,0,c6734cx,t3_zps67,t1_c6734cx,t1_c66pzos,null,1429880078,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Kelvin Mackenzie's statement in full (via the Press Association):

Today I offer my profuse apologies to the people of Liverpool for that headline. I too was totally misled. Twenty three ago I was handed a piece of copy from a reputable news agency in Sheffield in which a senior police officer and a senior local MP were making serious allegations against fans in the stadium. I had absolutely no reason to believe that these authority figures would lie and deceive over such a disaster.

As the Prime Minister has made clear these allegations were wholly untrue and were part of a concerted plot by police officers to discredit the supporters thereby shifting the blame for the tragedy from themselves.

It has taken more than two decades, 400,000 documents and a two-year inquiry to discover to my horror that it would have been far more accurate had I written the headline The Lies rather than The Truth.

true,Ezterhazy,null,null,"The Interim Taylor Report, written 4 months after the disaster, exonerated the fans. So, yes, we are sure 23 years later that the survivors of the Hillsborough disaster were not complicit in the deaths of their friends and relatives.

Hillsborough was an unsafe ground. Fans (of clubs other than Liverpool) were hospitalised due to crushing in the same Leppings Lane End at a couple of previous semi-finals in the 1980s. Despite this, Liverpool (with more fans in attendance) were allocated the smaller Leppings Lane End, partly because it would ease traffic congestion outside the ground. Also, the safety certificate was out of date on the ground - something that was not picked up on by the police, the FA or the local authority.

The police officer in command of policing, CS Duckenfield, received three separate reports from one of his Superintendents, with other senior officers in agreement, advising of the possibility of fatalities if a gate was not opened. Duckenfield only allowed the gate to be opened five minutes after first being advised about the likelihood of fatalities but crucially didn't advise either the control room or the officers inside the ground about this decision. 

Fans were directed into parts of the Leppings Lane End that were already full. This mirrored previous near-misses at the ground when fans were hospitalised. An important fact to remember about this is that the Leppings Lane End wasn't at capacity when the disaster occurred. There were not too many fans trying to gain admittance and there wasn't any crowd trouble The problem was that the fans were directed by the police into the already full central pens and not to the sides of the stand which had capacity.

Afterwards, the police took part in a cover-up. Every police statement about the disaster was read, and 164 were amended, by senior officers who were not present in order to lay the blame on the fans. Journalists and politicians were briefed by the police that the fans were to blame. The FA was told that fans had forced open the gate that the police themselves opened.

The Taylor Report criticised the police strongly. But Lord Justice Taylor wasn't aware when he wrote the report that police statements had been routinely falsified, so the Taylor Report does not take that into account.

Relevant sections of the Taylor Report about the fans:

On the ""late"" arrival of Liverpool fans
&gt;Whether those who arrived between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm were ""late"" was much debated. The ticket simply requested its holder ""to take up [his] position 15 minutes before kick-off. That may have been intended to persuade those with stand tickets to take their seats, but it would not be unreasonable for a standing spectator to arrive at the turnstiles between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm.

On drunken fans:
&gt;Of those who arrived at 2.30 pm or after, very many had been drinking at public houses or had brought drink from home or an off-licence. I am satisfied on the evidence, however, that the great majority were not drunk nor even the worse for drink.

On uncooperative fans:
&gt;Superintendent Marshall and other officers criticised the crowd as unco-operative because police exhortations to stop pushing and to ease back were not heeded. How could they be? In that crush most people had no control over their movements at all.

&gt;However, there were also eyewitness accounts of a horse being physically lifted off its feet by the crowd. That occurred, as the police accepted, without malice or intent but as an involuntary consequence of crowd pressure which those by the horse's flanks could not resist any more than the horse itself.

On ticketless fans:
&gt;Again, however, the police witnesses who most impressed me did not consider the number of ticketless fans to be inordinately large. This accords with two other sources of evidence.

On a conspiracy among ticketless fans to get in the ground:
&gt;I have already found that there was not an abnormally large number of fans without tickets on this occasion. With one or two exceptions, the police witnesses themselves did not subscribe to the ""conspiracy"" theory. I am satisfied that the large concentration at Leppings Lane from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm did not arrive as a result of any concerted plan.

On the actions of the police:
&gt;Superintendent Marshall realised the crowd had become unmanageable. Although loth to do so, since it was contrary to basic police strategy, he decided to request the exit gates be opened to relieve the pressure. Otherwise, he feared fatalities would occur. Other senior officers outside the ground agreed. At 2.47 pm he radioed control to permit the gates to be opened. At 2.48 pm, whilst Mr Duckenfield was considering the request, gate C opened to eject a youth who had climbed in with no ticket. Immediately, fans outside took advantage and about 150 managed to get in before a mounted officer enabled the gate to be closed again. Mr Marshall repeated his request. Still no response from control. He repeated it a third time, adding that if the 11 gates were not opened someone was going to be killed. In the control room, Mr Duckenfield had not made a decision. Mr Murray asked him ""Are you going to open the gates?"". Mr Duckenfield gave the order and Sgt Goddard radioed to Mr Marshall ""Open the gates"". Neither the Club control room nor any police officers inside the turnstiles were told of this order before or after it was given or of any action it would require.

&gt;When Mr Marshall's request came, Mr Duckenfield's capacity to take decisions and give orders seemed to collapse. Having sanctioned, at last, the opening of the gates, he failed to give necessary consequential orders or to exert any control when the disaster occurred. He misinterpreted the emergence of fans from pens 3 and 4. When he was unsure of the problem, he sent others down to ""assess the situation"" rather than descend to see for himself. He gave no information to the crowd.

&gt;Since pens 3 and 4 were full by 2.50 pm, the tunnel should have been closed off whether gate C was to be opened or not. The exercise was a simple one and had been carried out in 1988. All that was necessary was for a few officers to act as a cordon at the entrance to the tunnel and divert fans elsewhere. Unfortunately, the 1988 closure seems to have been unknown to the senior officers on duty at the time. It did not figure in the debriefing notes. It therefore had no influence on the planning for 1989.

&gt;Planning apart, however, it should have been clear in the control room where there was a view of the pens and of the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to be closed. If orders had been given to that effect when gate C was opened, the fans could have been directed to the empty areas of the wings and this disaster could still have been avoided. Failure to give that order was a blunder of the first magnitude.

96 people went to a football match and died. The disaster was avoidable. If it hadn't been Liverpool in 1989, it would have been another club another time. Nobody has been brought to account for the disaster.

true,Jonny1992,lfc12,,"This is nothing more than I expect from Everton. We have our differences but the fact is that Liverpool FC was not the only victim on that day.

For those of you not from Liverpool, families are commonly divided in the city. A mother can be a blue and a father a red. A son a red, a daughter a blue. For 363 days of the year the city of Liverpool is united. Two days a year families split off into their separate colours and go off to a football game to support their club. They come back home, they joke about Liverpool beating Everton over dinner with their blue shirted mother and the city reunites once again. 

On the day of Hillsborough many Liverpool fans lost their lives but many Everton fans lost their loved ones. Family and friends were torn apart by failings that claimed the lives of 96 men, women and children who went to watch their football team on a day that was supposed to be filled with glory. 

The city unites over issues such as Hillsborough and the murder of Rhys Jones. Z-Cars played instead of You'll Never Walk alone and Everton fans wearing 'JFT96' on their backs.

I love Liverpool and I love Liverpudlians. It is the actions of the residents of this city that have allowed Justice to be delivered today.

Unless he knew how the time stream played out(that Boe would see 10 before Jack did again). 

Which could bring in to question that if the monks did chop of Jacks head, but the body still regrew it that Jack and Face of Boe lived independently of each other, but where still connected. 

I still stand by my theory that The Doctor is not alone. Either *spoiler* The Master is still around, or there are more of them.

true,Jasd1234,null,null,"I've lived 5 minutes away from shadsworth estate all my life, and for a short period I lived on the highercroft estate which is basically down the road and on the same levels of poverty and poorness. The BBC have painted the worst possible picture of the estate they could and I feel they could have balanced it a little better with the positives that are currently happening there. 

I believe it was filmed a few years ago and today if you drive through it is a much cleaner and respectable place to live. Slowly but surely they are improving aspects of the whole place. About 8 years ago I would never walk through neither shadsworth or highercroft if it got later than 8 o'clock because, to put it lightly, you'd be lucky to walk through without getting your head kicked in if you didn't know any of the local lads.

In the 90s and early 00's, the estate I currently live on was an absolute shit hole, but with youth programs and a different approach to policing it has been a much better place to live. 

The program mentions that some kids go to Fernhurst school for activities and such to keep them occupied and off the streets but bear in mind, that school is nearly 5 miles away. As far as I know, there isn't the same facility in the actual shad estate quite like highercroft or my own estate, and I personally think this would be a good starting point to get things improving at a faster pace.

The kids say they are bored, shit excuse. When I was bored as a kid I didn't go smashing windows and robbing cars. These kids are doing these things because there's someone, somewhere on the estate they are trying to prove themselves to. I was glad to see the account of the kid who moved in with his aunt because he knew if he stayed he probably would never get out of there (although judging from the program, he actually moved to highercroft, I hope he lives in the good part!)

Rose's situation is different: high school dropout, no higher education. It's unclear whether the parallel universe had a Doctor before ours showed up, so her travels with the Doctor and her experiences in the field would be a big selling point to parallel UNIT. Also, the mere fact that she's from a parallel universe to theirs probably counts as some sort of credential.

She's always gotten by on her looks (kiss-o-gram?), and modelling's a good career that plays to her strengths.

However I can say without a doubt, Scotland's nightlife is *cheaper*. You wont see any night clubs charging more than a fiver (if anything at all) to get in, meanwhile its common to see night clubs past the £25+ entry range in England.

People tend to drink hard in Scotland too, and a lot more frequently due to how cheap the drink is. That's not saying more people do it, it's just more culturally ingrained over here, and its cheaper and therefore easier to abuse to a excess.

reposition it. 

you are willing to do an unpaid internship. 

you are not asking for charity. 

also read this. 
http://steve-yegge.blogspot.co.uk/2007/09/ten-tips-for-slightly-less-awful-resume.html

your self description breaches 5 of steve's rules in one go
if ""i am an excellent developer"" sounds too presumptuous for you, congratulations. you are already better than 80% of the workforce with the same skill but without the honesty to admit they have stuff to learn. 

you really do not want to enter the workforce as a charity case (and if this were another country I'd tell you to scrap the ""unpaid"" bit, but i understand things may be different here.)

think what value you will give to a prospective employer and go for that. 

don't undervalue yourself. 

try this on for size. 

""I've just graduated from a top university, and i seek to join a strong team where i can contribute to meaningful projects. "" 
""I work very well under pressure and have consistently met deadlines on past assignments.""
""I have the ability to concentrate on a project for extended period""

or whatever.

two books i recommend to fix that ""work under pressure"" issue you've raised.

They ARE on Netflix, but not a part of the list. So make sure you STOP after Season 4 and **watch these before beginning Season 5** (The Eleventh Hour)

**The Specials are, in order:**

**1) Planet of the Dead**

**2) The Waters of Mars**

**3) The End of Time Part 1**

**4) The End of Time Part 2**

Henderson's best role for me would be a possession retaining mid(in Allen's role), I just can't see him making a transition to DM. His tackling % was one of the highest on the team because he attempted so little, he mostly stands there jockeying a player holding up their run forward.

true,Stormwatch36,cyberman,Cyberperson,"I think that was the entire point. It was completely realistic. Normally when The Doctor walks into a situation, people are only slightly wary of him before seeing his cleverness and immediately following him. Midnight was an episode where he walks in to a place full of real people who have the capacity to be total assholes. You know a lot about our situation? You must be in on it, trying to screw us. You're very smart, what, so you think you're better than us? Who are you? Let's hear a *real* name, cut the shit. We don't like how you seem happy about us dying.

That's why I think it's the best episode. Not my favorite by any means, but the best just because it's so incredibly realistic with its characters. Everyone in the episode acts how most people would *actually* act if The Doctor showed up and was himself. (Which is actually a bit of a depressing truth about the world.) They get very scared of him, and just don't want to put up with him for the most part once shit hits the fan because he's so intimidating in and of himself.

Which doesn't matter all that much, there's one little bit of ""prophecy"" that you miss out on, but it gets referenced so much in the next episodes you'll get the message.

Anyway, after Season 4 (which, on Netflix, actually ends with the first Special, *The Next Doctor*), you can try and hunt down *Planet of the Dead* if you want, but yeah, it's not on Netflix streaming.  Then you'll need to do a search for *Doctor Who: The Waters of Mars* on Netflix, which *is* available on streaming.  After that, do the same for *Doctor Who: The End of Time*, which is a 2-part special, also available on Netflix streaming.

They then find Rory's gravestone, so now they know what time he went back to, but they can't save him as this would create a paradox (if they saved him the gravestone would never have been placed there for them to find). Amy is so upset that she sacrifices herself to the weeping angel - she walks towards it and touches it, (while the Doctor is screaming at her to not do it), thus sending her back in time to Rory, so they can live the rest of their lives together.

Also, as somebody who has severe anxiety I advise the following:

Do at least SOME hard exercise in the week. Enough to make your muscles ache, and make you break a sweat. Exercise causes your brain to release endorphins, which help immensely. This is the single best advice I can give you. If possible, do the exercise outside. 

Stop smoking, doing any illicit drugs, and go out drinking no more than once per week.

Start to have a more philosophical outlook on life. Realise that one day, we are all going to be die, and that's just fine. I hate to sound like a wet blanket, but coming to terms with my own mortality really helped me; I now have a better work ethic, and go out of my way to help others more than I would have. 

Keep the following phrase in your head: ""Well at least I don't live in Somalia""

You may find you do some stupid shit when you're alone, maybe you act childishly when nobody is looking? We all do this a bit. But I found for me it helped a lot when I started to respect myself as a person. It builds character when you can resist the temptation to sing in to a hairbrush. Don't go overboard though, we all need a bit of silliness.

Spend as little time on the internet as you can. The internet is fucking depressing. Moronic uninformed people who hate everyone spewing bile on matters they know little about. Who needs it.

In summary: Many or all of the things I just said may not work for you, but they all helped me to manage living with severe anxiety and depression.

But there's more to the story!! In the final two years, as a med student, you are no longer given a student maintenance loan and are given an NHS grant .... for half the amount. So the interest-free loan you would normally get may be replaced by an interest-based one from the bank if you would like, you know, somewhere to live, something to eat every now and that kinda thing.

'Amid gasps in the Commons, Mr Cameron revealed that 164 police statements were significantly altered and that criminal checks were done to ""impugn the reputations of the deceased"".'

I'm sure we'll have the usual police apologists on here later to tell us why we shouldn't take the view that this demonstrates the institutional corruption at the heart of British policing (call it the locker room mentality if you will, but it's more political and supported up the hierarchy than that), but I'm sorry to say that it doesn't make me gasp at all. It does make me gasp a bit to hear that it makes the political class gasp (though I'm at least two thirds of the way to believing it's a faux gasp in any event). Day after day in working in several roles in the British CJS I heard stories relating to this, and - at least some of the time - I believed it or had independent, occasionally definitive, corroborating evidence. We managed to catch out a number of bent coppers, but there were many many more, and sadly many senior officers, who got away with it again and again. Yes, the Met is far far worse than most, but it runs the length and breadth of the country, and sadly way too many juries and almost all magistrates are still very much in thrall to the forces of ""law and order"".

It's also extremely narrow, with Ramires really only occupying a wide-ish position.

Stretching the attacking three into a spearhead (LW/CF/RW) might be an okay solution but it does mean our formation is a bit unbalanced.

------------------------

Anybody else at work, and not able to concentrate? If you’re a Liverpool fan, chances are your lack of focus today won’t be a result of usual office boredom for once.

The files of documents and evidence relating to the Hillsborough disaster are released today, and as I write this at lunchtime, the early information coming out is appalling:

    First news trickling out and it’s ugly. Blood taken from bodies to test for alcohol. If none, they checked for criminal records (@TonyEvansTimes)

On a personal level, I find it very difficult to describe my feelings regarding Hillsborough. I was only nine years old when it happened, I wasn’t there, I don’t personally know anyone who was there, I hadn’t been to a football match at the time, and I never experienced the dark days of going to football when fans were fenced in like animals.

Yet, as a Liverpool fan, whatever your age, race or religion, Hillsborough’s always there, isn’t it?

People in my office aren’t talking amongst themselves about the files being released today, but a few people have asked me about it. Aside from saying I want the truth come out, I don’t know what to say. But then who doesn’t want the truth to come out?

And even if it does, how does that affect me, really? I’ll be pleased for the families and friends of the victims, but beyond that? My feeling (whatever it is)  won’t go away entirely. The tragedy and subsequent lies will have still happened to a group of people who I am proud to consider myself a member of – Liverpool supporters – but not to me directly.

Regarding your question about the crowd, an explanation of the science behind why tragedies like this aren't caused simply by ""people pushing forwards at the back"" can be found in [this article](http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2118142,00.html) about the stampede at the Love Parade in Duisburg, Germany, that cost 21 lives in 2010.

Today's apology from Sheffield Wednesday (SWFC), at whose ground the Hillsborough disaster occurred, gives more background as to why the crushing happened:

&gt;From the earliest safety assessments made by safety engineers commissioned in 1978 by SWFC, it was apparent that the stadium failed to meet minimum standards under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and established in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (known as the 'Green Guide'), 1976. Documents released to the Panel confirm that the local Advisory Group for Safety at Sports Grounds carried out inadequate and poorly recorded inspections. There is clear evidence that SWFC's primary consideration was cost and, to an extent, this was shared by its primary safety consultants, Eastwood &amp; Partners....

&gt;Recommendations to feed fans directly from designated turnstiles into each pen, thus monitoring precisely the distribution of fans between the pens, were not acted on because of anticipated costs to SWFC ...The fire service ...raised concerns about provision for emergency evacuation of the terraces. As the only means of escaping forwards was onto the pitch, concern was raised specifically about the width of the perimeter fence gates which was well below the standard recommended by the Green Guide. The gradient of the tunnel under the West Stand leading down onto the terrace also significantly breached the Green Guide's recommendation ...

&gt;While modifications were made inside the stadium, the issue of congested access to the turnstiles outside the stadium remained unresolved ...Following alterations, the safety of the existing maximum capacity for the Leppings Lane terrace was questioned repeatedly yet the decision was taken by the Club and the safety engineers not to revise the figure ...

&gt;From the documents disclosed to the panel, key issues - positioning of safety barriers, elevation of the tunnel, adequacy of the perimeter fence gates - were not discussed or recorded at the annual safety inspections ...

The walkway UP to the pens (which were fenced with no chance of escape) was so narrow fans could not see what was going on, there were no police or stewards directing people towards empty pens and the as 99% of people do, the fans went straight ahead. At previous matches the standard of policing and stewarding were substantially better, but as we know in previous matches at the same stadium in the SAME end these kind of things had happened previously with numerous people being injured and almost fatally. Once in the narrow tunnel there was no chance of escape, there was no knowledge of what awaiting them until it was too late. They marched to their deaths.

It was the failure of the police and the organisers of the match that caused this event. Not the fans.


Edit: Perhaps I should apologise, although I don't think it's the right word at all, because I feel no remorse for the way I speak about this, I'm sorry if you are just trying to learn. Sadly too many people are ignorant to the truth of what happened, for many years Liverpool fans have been called murderers, have had a constant smear campaign against them and many of the pubilc have sadly been drawn into it and gone along with these lies.

If I'm honest, I felt ashamed at my disability and needing financial help because of it. 

The one thing that worries me is that in early 2013, DLA is being transferred over to a benefit called PIP, which would mean going through the whole assessment process twice in rapid succession. Due to the assessment process having the possibility to be quite demanding and draining (infamously so, it's been the same with Incapacity &amp; ESA), I would ideally like to wait until I only apply for the PIP benefit in 2013. I know this may not be possible, due to my situation being quite desperate.

I have the number for the CAB office now, although it was closed today. I will be contacting them as soon as possible. I'm not quite sure whether there are disability charities in my area, and I'm nor quite sure where to start looking. I'll try a simple google search to start with! Having someone in my corner will make things much easier.. I'm very worried right now.

I deny any Cornish connections).

To be honest - I don't feel like I'm missing out on much. If we're going to have national boundaries, I think they should be on purely pragmatic lines: physical geography, and economics. Ethnicity &amp; culture is already too blurred to be meaningful, and any attempts to purify it would be horrifying (I know that's not what you meant).

I think the ethnic / cultural game is inevitably going to be lost. Most of the national ""culture"" that people claim to identify with is already tourist crap and history book stuff. The decent bits of music and art will find their place in what supersedes them - as they always have. There's a place for folk art purists: it's a monthly session in a quiet pub, or whatever, and I wish them well and turn up and listen sometimes (and play, actually). But that's enough. Don't try to re-inflate a knackered wheel.

There *are* ethnic and cultural differences, which you can see every day if you travel around Britain. And they're part of what makes the place exciting and wonderful. But they're impossible to *preserve*, because (a) they're the indefinable local differences in accent and phrasing and shared humour that no form of *policy* can ever encapsulate, and (b) they're already changing, all the time, because that is their nature, and also how they came to be.

true,InsufferableTwat,null,null,"Well, I think we're agreed that it should be a matter of economic pragmatism, then.

To pick the most obvious issues with that video (other than the tone of the thing, which appears to be aimed squarely at morons): 

The ""revenues from royal property"" argument doesn't seem to consider that most of that land is **Crown Estate**, and not actually owned by the monarch or her family. Nevertheless, the video makes out that they generously pay the revenues from ""their"" land to the exchequer. 

Even if all of the land in question *were* privately owned by the royals, we may reasonably ask on what basis, and whether historical privilege is sufficient *reason* to take the power to manage and earn profit from large parts of the country from, say, the people who live there. (I accept that this case could be made about any private property, including my garden. But we're talking here about the *fat* end of the wedge, not the thin end.)

The tourism figures are jolly high aren't they! I'm not sure where they came from, but I'd say that the ""royal fairly dust"" attracting tourists like flies around shite needs a fairly large ""Citation needed"" bolted to it, perhaps next to the royal crest. 

The word ""because"" comes up in this video hilariously: yanks visit British castles rather than French ones because ""the royals still use them"". Right. He actually says that. What's astonishing is that somebody might believe it. Even if we had admission figures to castles to hand, adjusted for size of country and numbers of castles to the square mile, we *might* still find other reasons to account for a (supposed) difference in numbers.

The service has been run with a 175 unit, might have been that I suppose. At this point we're just guessing though.

&gt;So a good use of Welsh taxpayers' money, then.

Yeah. I can sort of see the point of a 'premier' North - South train but then when the local Welsh papers go digging about the money it's costing, you start to wonder if it needs a full first class dining car.

Though after my recent travel I do wonder how much longer full first class facilities will last on trains.

&gt;How good are those roads? Our A-roads (no motorways in Cornwall) are mostly dual carriageway and partly not. Lots of bottlenecks.

Both are single-carriageway roads for most of their length, as far as I know. Very twisty and hilly. Lots of small towns and villages on both roads, and outside of these the speed limit has been changed down to 40mph. Some towns like Newtown in Powys need a bypass, and have always had traffic jams because of the lights in the town centre.

&gt;Luxury! In Cornwall you struggle to do 70 (I guess the millions of viaducts and a very curvy track don't help), it's only when you go past Exeter going towards London that you break 100mph.

70's great compared to my local line. GPS on my phone measured my train at about 45mph once, the most the track can currently offer. Improvements to 60mph might be due 'in the future'...

Some people have said the Great Western line through Cornwall should be completely rebuilt inland between Exeter and Penzance. Would that be something you would agree with?

Would it only be if your family had held on to the same land for a set period of time, only if you own a certain amount of land (but then large corporations and charities might also be caught up) or would we just arbitrarily decide that the royal family should be the only ones subjected to this treatment?

police officers present at the match, of ""mass drunkenness"". It was said that drunken fans urinated on the
police while they were pulling the dead and injured out, that others had even urinated on the bodies of the dead
and stolen their belongings. Not a single witness was called before the Inquiry to support any of those
allegations although every opportunity was afforded for any of the represented parties to have any witness
called whom they wished. As soon as the allegations I have mentioned were made in the press, Mr Peter
Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, made a dignified statement dissociating himself from such grave

true,radgie,scottish,Scotland,"PIP will be for new (adult) claimants only from 2013 - so if you claim now you will only need to be reassessed for PIP long after that (ESA replaced Incapacity Benefit *years* ago and there still many many people who haven't yet been transferred over) probably more like 2016. 

My advice would be to apply for DLA with some help - CAB are excellent and very experienced in helping people to apply for this. It's also much better to do this now as welfare rights advisors won't have the same wealth of experience in claiming once PIP comes in. Be prepared to get quite personal about the help that you need, and I am sorry, but it may be quite a depressing experience for you. They don't want to hear about your abilities and aspirations - they want to know what you need help with. You will need to think about what it is like on a bad day - and how often you have bad days or better days. 

The knock on effects of DLA are very important and it is well worth claiming this - that money is paid to people whether they are working or not, because having a disability costs more no matter who you are. It's there for good reason, and if you fit the criteria then it is your right to claim it.

I figured you'd be in halls but if you knew which ones it'd be easier to make workable suggestions. Traversing some parts of the city on foot or by bus isn't much of a problem. Others are needless hassle.

&gt;How much is food to eat relatively healthy?

Anywhere between £30 and £80 per week, I guess? I have no idea. I buy groceries with friends and eat as a group to maximise efficiency.

There's a farmers' market but I don't know if it fulfils the same role as in the states. It's somewhere I'd find fun delicatessen style items, not groceries. If I want vegetables cheaply I go to a specialised green grocer, meat to a butcher. Both can be had at supermarkets, obviously, but in terms of price and choice I find them rather lacking.

They also often did the ""Hello, I'm the Doctor!"" ""Doctor? Doctor who?"" gag as well.

(little bit of related trivia, the first time the question ""Doctor who?"" is asked in the show was in the second episode of the first serial, which was titled ""The Cave of Skulls"". When Dorium tells the 11th Doctor that ""Doctor who?"" is the first and most important question, he does so in a cave of skulls!)

true,Prairie_Dog,cyberman,Cyberperson,"Classic Who generally didn't have the season-long story arcs we see in the reboot, so watching order isn't as important. There were some exceptions like the Trial of a Time Lord season, or the E-Space Trilogy. So, unless you are in one of the rare series, don't feel you must watch things in a completely linear fashion.

Now, I certainly wouldn't start before the Third Doctor. This is when the show started being filmed in color, and there are no missing or partially reconstructed episodes from this point to present. You can always go back and watch the First and Second Doctors later on. 

The Fourth Doctor is a fan favorite, and had the longest run of any Doctor. He had some of the best episodes in the classic period,  but also some pretty lame episodes. It's hard to go wrong suggesting him as a starting point. In any case, I would strongly suggest you should sample some of his best episodes.

The Fifth Doctor is also one of my favorites, he generally had a lot of companions, and was a more serious and almost fatherly figure. His run had somewhat better effects and writing.

The Sixth Doctor's run was cut short by the BBC, and his character wasn't as fully developed as it should have been. However, I think the Trial of a Time Lord season was some of the best effects and stories of the late classic period.

I personally don't care for the Seventh Doctor. He also had a pretty short run before the BBC cancelled the show, so we never got to see his character develop. He was supposed to be a darker and more serious Doctor. He does have a cool companion, Ace, who I liked a lot.

The Eighth Doctor is an easy one to start with as he is only represented on screen by the 1996 ""Doctor Who: The Movie"" which was intended to be the pilot for a reboot that didn't happen.

Area of concern is with this part of the article:

&gt; He has also successfully campaigned for jail sentences for people who refuse to provide a decrypting key to allow police to inspect computers suspected of holding child pornography.

Technically, it is illegal to not provide a ""key"" to any ""encrypted data"" in the UK.

We have [Section 53](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/section/53) and [Section 49](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/section/49) [\(Wikipedia link for Section 49\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_Investigatory_Powers_Act_2000).

Will this now extend to hard copy text also? **How will they gain access to monitor and vet such text**?

With Theresa May pushing the [Communications Bill Draft \(PDF\)](http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm83/8359/8359.pdf) through parliament as:

* ""it is critical to everyday policing""
* ""it is vital to law enforcement when dealing with organised crime gangs paedophile rings and terrorist groups""
*  ""it enables the police to build a picture of the activities and contacts of a person who is under investigation"" 

[Source: \(PDF\)](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/counter-terrorism/key-background?view=Binary ""Communications Data Bill Introduction, Page 2: Section: 'Why is communications data important?'""), it does seem that the [Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Infocalypse) are soon on our doorsteps(!)

Every time I read articles like this I always scream **""Where's the burden of proof?!""**.

[Did you know that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_burden_of_proof#Standard_of_proof:_United_Kingdom_trials)  section 31(2)(a) of the Children Act 1989 requires any facts used as the basis of a prediction that a child is “likely to suffer significant harm” **to be proved to have happened?** [\(Reference on an appeal of this powerful stance\)](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldjudgmt/jd080611/child-1.htm)

Personally in my opinion, this is probably why any laws such as these and future ones will probably go through without much deliberation as the burden of proof is already set.  
(I'm assuming in laws like these, this means **everyone in the UK technically can cause a child ""significant harm""**). 

This can mean we are all guilty until proven innocent but I would love to have more solid information / corrections on this though...

true,Natalia_Bandita,tardis,TARDIS,"maybe it varies person to person. Because like i said...my friend watched the first episode of this season, AND the second..and she kept saying ""who's that"" ""whats that?""  Ages before the premier (when i had first gotten into it and finished seasons 1-4 in 2 weeks),  she asked me to show her one of my favorite episodes. It was hard to choose ONE, but I showed her Vincent and the Doctor and the doctors wife. She loved it but still had many questions. 

i DO agree that the first few episodes of the first season are a bit difficult. My boyfriend has seen the first two and said he couldnt get into it...but hes watched the two episodes of this season and he said he really likes it. 

I told him that its corny and low budget at first, but thats because it had just started up again after a long hiatus. Regardless of how cheap or slow moving a little of the first season may be, i feel its essential to watch that first season because the Doctor was so different..and a lot of why he is the way he is now, has to do with all the seasons before this one. First season...the 9th doctor... he just came out of the time war...he was angry, he was disconnected. He avoided thinking about the past, he was more *in the present* and he was a bit darker than 10 or 11.  He didnt think he could save everyone. Rose showed him he COULD save everyone. Then he sacrificed himself for her. The 10th doctor formed a really important emotional bond with Rose, and he allowed himself to love and be open again...and then ...well those of us who watched (or read spoilers) know what happened to Rose. Then Martha...who left the doctor on her own..who realized she didnt want to wait for someone like him...he realized her departure was his fault... Then martha, who was this nutter that questioned everything he did, and taught him a lot about himself and his companions...he was so lonely after martha..and  A VERY important episode came after her. When something happened and a planet and at the end of it all- he realized that he NEEDED a companion (The Waters Of Mars)... and then he become 11 and met Amy. Ughh..there is JUST SOOO much history in between seasons 1 and now that its PAINFUL for me to think that people havent seen it. 

My friend is just finished The Long Game and she said its already getting easier to watch and she loves the 9th doctor.

I dunno...i personally think its imperative that people watch 1-4. I feel like you dont really know who 11 is or who Amy, River and Rory are if you dont watch.  

Doctor Who is a serial television series, which by definition means that basic plot unfolds in a sequential episode by episode order. Serials have a story arc and that basic plot spans the entire series (however long it may be) and because of this if you miss episodes.. you get left in the dark.

You know it's you and me, boy

There really are no others

Our sadness brought you over

How

Did you expect me to stay

Damsel delusions in the way

Eyes hypnotizing me closer

Fear

Never got in the way

You made it seem okay

Explosions, no more illusions

And I

Am not afraid of you

All I ever have to do

In danger, is to

Yell ""Doctor, Doctor!""


Yes

You were just a stranger

Steering me out of danger

Nameless, but for one word - 

""Doctor, Doctor!""

You

Told me how you could feel the earth

Moving swiftly under us

Tilting back and forwards

""Doctor, Doctor!""

Now

You're telling me you're an alien

And that you don't have a friend

To come with you the distance

""Doctor, Doctor!""

Some

How you're speaking in brilliance

About my planet's desecrance

Thinking I will enjoy it

""Doctor, Doctor!""


I'm staring though the glass, now

Where do I find them and how

The last remaining humans

Wait

The sun filter's getting lower

The cracks are getting closer

And now the door won't open

""Help, Doctor, Doctor!""



Yes

You were just a stranger

Steering me out of danger

Nameless, but for one word - 

""Doctor, Doctor!""

You

Told me how you could feel the earth

Moving swiftly under us

Tilting back and forwards

""Doctor, Doctor!""

You

Try to soothe me with your voice

Even though it is trembling

You've never sounded menacing

""Doctor, Doctor!""

I'm 

Dodging sunbeams, praying

My morale is decaying

Wince as I keep saying - 

""Doctor, Doctor!""

Now, Barrowman does not give an answer to it.  He says he would like to see those questions answered.  So, while it seems unlikely that the boy in stasis would be Jack, it should be clarified that Rose/the TARDIS/time are NOT responsible for Jack's ""gift.""

I think RDM and the staff have a adequate long term solution in place. The current choice is Mikel. However we need to see Mikel succeed in terms of pace, creativity, and in his ability to link the defense and midfield. The next obvious choice is Romeu, who has not gotten enough minutes to prove himself one way or the other. The author declares that Ramires is the perfect fit, but many here and online have bemoaned the lack of size and strength of Ramires to thrive in the double pivot. The next possibility is that we fill the spot with a signing, but there is another attractive plan already in action. Michael Essien has been given 12 months at Real Madrid to reunite with Mourinho and reignite his ability.

I've been running on so little sleep I can't remember shit)  Almost makes me think that I might actually know what I'm talking about, which of course is highly improbable.

As for transitioning Lampard and Terry out of the team, that's going to be tough because they form the main part of the soul of Chelsea!  With Terry it's going to be easier, but only in the sense that we have players who will be direct replacements.  Who's replacing Lampard?  I have a feeling that RDM would be approaching games with a slightly different philosophy if Frank wasn't around, and is kind of forced to go with something slightly different for now.  The fact that we don't have a younger version of Lampard on our U21 squad is also sort of telling - because we have younger versions for almost every other type of player on the squad not only positionally but also role-wise.  You could argue that McEachran is that player, but he is far weaker than Lampard in terms of brute strength, at least from what I have seen.  Different body type, etc.

I'm very excited for the team though...  I think we have a very bright future ahead of us!  We are in a transitional period right now and have lucked out a bit with RDM being there at the right place at the right time, but we have been buying up very promising youngsters for the last couple years and have a very exciting future in store in terms of young players coming into the first team.  I don't think it'd be far fetched to say that most of the youngsters that we do have look promising enough to eventually end up in our starting 11.  It's going to be an exciting next 5-10 years I think and we are going to have the potential to win a lot of trophies, but the next year or two might be a bit bumpy..  We've had a good start to the season but a couple things are still not quite right.  I just hope RDM doesn't get shit on once we have a bad run of form, because that time will come.

true,InsufferableTwat,null,null,"&gt;I don't think stripping people of their inherited land would really benefit any of us

Well, it didn't do the US any harm! Seriously though, ""private property"" is only ever really a matter of consensus and degree. It's not as if the chapter of history on this issue has ever closed. Consider one logical extreme: it's inconceivable that all of a country could be genuinely *owned* by a single person or company, because the disempowered populace would quickly boot them off. The other extreme - divide the land up equally - is similarly impossible, because even if the means could be found to *do* it, it would quickly revert back to an ownership system with inequalities in it. So we're left with some form of in-between, like what we have now. 

I don't think it's out of the question at all for a government to re-apportion private land. It does exactly this every time it needs to build a railway or a road: if the owners won't sell up willingly at what they consider to be a fair price, it's compulsory-purchased and that's that. We can apply the similar principles to the Dutchy of Cornwall for a start...

The tourism argument you've described basically says: we'll keep the royals, because some relatively wealthy foreigners want to *believe* in them. With very, very few exceptions they won't *see* them. They'll see the castles and the jewellery and buy the tea towels. It's not a zoo, they don't get to feed prince phillip a bun and get to watch Fergie surfacing from her bath with a turd balanced on her nose like some sort of Sloane Hippo.

Edit - *dutchy* of cornwall, not dutch of cornwall! The last thing we need is an orange order in Cornwall...

THE DOCTOR : Well... (Jack gasps for breath as he comes back to life. The Doctor removes his glasses). I’ve got just the man.

JACK : Was someone kissing me ?

THE DOCTOR : Trust me. We’ve found a way of tripping the system. Run ! (Atillo leaves. Jack is removing his shirt). Wh... What are you taking your clothes off for ?

JACK : I’m going in.

THE DOCTOR : Well by the looks of it, I’d say that stet radiation doesn’t affect clothing, only flesh.

JACK : I look good though. (Stops at door). How long have you known ?

THE DOCTOR : Ever since I ran away from you. Good luck.

THE DOCTOR : Receiving, yeah. He’s inside.

THE DOCTOR : Oh, yes.

THE DOCTOR : When did you first realize ?

JACK : Earth 1892. Got in a fight in Ellis Island. A man shot me through the heart. Then I woke up. Thought it was kinda strange. But then it never stopped. Fell off a cliff, trampled by horses, World War I, World War II, poison, strangulation, a stray javelin... (The Doctor winces). In the end, I got the message, I’m the man who can never die. And all that time you knew.

THE DOCTOR : That’s why I left you behind. It’s not easy even just... just looking at you Jack, 'cause you’re wrong.

JACK : Thanks.

THE DOCTOR : You are, I can’t help it. I’m a Time Lord. It’s instinct. It’s in my guts. You’re a fixed point in time a space. You’re a fact. That’s never meant to happen. Even the TARDIS reacted against you, tried to shake you off. Flew all the way to the end of the universe just to get rid of you.

JACK : So what you’re saying is that you’re, uh, (finishes third coupling) prejudiced ?

THE DOCTOR : I never thought of it like that.

JACK : Yeah.

JACK : Last thing I remember back when I was mortal... I was facing three Daleks. Death by extermination. And then I came back to life. What happened ?

THE DOCTOR : Rose.

JACK : I thought you sent her back home.

THE DOCTOR : She came back. Opened the heart of the TARDIS and absorbed the time vortex.

JACK : What does that mean, exactly ?

THE DOCTOR : No one’s ever mean to have that power. If a Time Lord did that, he’d become a god, a vengeful god. But she was human.

Rose in ""Parting of the Ways"" glowing with vortex energy.

ROSE : I bring life.

Jack gasps and opens his eyes as he comes back to the for the first time.

THE DOCTOR : Everything she did was so human. She brought you back to life but she couldn’t control it. She brought you back forever. That’s something, I suppose. The final act of the Time War was life.

JACK : Do you think she could change me back ?

THE DOCTOR : I took the power out of her. She’s gone, Jack. She’s not just living on a parallel world, she’s trapped there. The walls have closed.

JACK : I’m sorry.

THE DOCTOR : Yep.

JACK : I went back to her estate, in the 90s, just once or twice. Watched her growing up. Never said hello, timelines and all that.

THE DOCTOR : Do you wanna die ?

JACK (struggling with coupling) : Oh, this one’s a little stuck.

THE DOCTOR : Jack ?

JACK : I thought I did. I dunno. But this lot, you see them out here surviving and that’s fantastic.

Ivanovic was appalling - probably his worst ever game, Luiz and Cahill were a shambles and Cole was average. The entire team was crap. The big idea of replacing him with Ramires?! The bloke who can't pass? Jesus Christ.

As for Terry - he's 31. Not 34. Or 35 or whatever. He's the best defender this club has ever produced and we're suddenly into ""put him out to pasture"" time? No. When people talk of Terry and Lampard together they often forget that Terry is a good few years younger. Terry started 31 Premier League games last season - let's compare to a few other top defenders to see if this ""Terry is getting more injury prone"" thing is true or a load of horseshit:

true,naturalalchemy,null,null,"&gt;Well, it didn't do the US any harm!

I think the key part here is the past tense. If you attempted something like this today it would be a political and economic disaster. I doubt many people would be willing to give up their land very easily.

&gt;I don't think it's out of the question at all for a government to re-apportion private land.

Again you haven't addressed my points about who would qualify to have their land taken. Is it if you are a member of the aristocracy (how close to royalty do you have to be)? 

Plenty of them have lost all their family land and money (would they qualify to get some of the reapportioned land?), so would only the ones that have actually managed to make a success of their business and farms have their land taken? That seems like punishing success and I doubt it will help the economy by dividing up a successful estate.

It really just sounds like petty jealousy at this point.

&gt;The tourism argument you've described basically says: we'll keep the royals, because some relatively wealthy foreigners want to believe in them.

If this encourages them to visit and spend their money and add to our economy I'm all for it. Of course you won't get to feed Philip a bun, but apparently all you need is the 'idea' that there 'might' be a royal there. I guess it's the same reason people camp outside a celebrity's home even when they aren't home. The difference is in this case the the 'celebrities' are recognisable in most countries across the globe.

When Kraft came in, they added Kraft products. They also had coffee, deodorant (Axe, 75p), and various other things including Terry's chocolate. 

No dirt to share, everything was super well run. The problem was that Kraft came in and decided that the sampling for chocolate (bacteria testing) wasn't good enough and doubled it. So they fell behind for a long time. My job was to make that the UK public didn't get poisoned. I approved the chocolate that went to the stores. 

Unfortunately the system sucked (it was new, thanks Kraft) and I quit after a few months because everyone was always yelling at me but I couldn't do anything because it didn't work. They asked me to come back in December (had a string of people who also left) but I refused.

In a word, we're looking for a bro to complete our lineup. We want someone who will play the game (hopefully at the same level as us—high to very high skill bracket) and be able to lose with dignity and be able to talk about it afterwards in a rational, friendly sort of manner. We all make mistakes. The four of us make mistakes, and whoever our new guy will be, they'll make mistakes too. We want someone quite experienced, and yes, having a microphone and a Skype account is crucial.

The ideal candidate is someone who has realized that at their level of play, the only realistic way to improve is to start playing with a consistent group of five people. Keep in mind that we're looking for a friend as much as we're looking for a fifth player, and while we do in some way aspire to rise to a certain level of play, it's imperative that we do so on a strong foundation. Basically, you need to be the kind of person who can get mad as fuck one night and then the next day come back and whatever transpired the night before is forgotten, because that's how we roll.

One quick note that deserves mentioning is that the four of us have jobs, study at university, or both. I'd like little more than to sit at home playing Dota all day, but I've gotta eat, too. If you feel that the time commitment we're able to give to the game because of this may not be enough or up to your standards, then perhaps we're not the ideal group for you.

**Gen 2:** ""Teenage issues""-parody world where humans are just replaced with ponies, basically.

**Gen 3:** Technicolor tea-party, dress-talky, nonsensical *GIRLY* stuff where it can't become much more pink.

**Gen 3.5:** Borderline retarded flash animation on the level of Internet flash animation.

**Gen 4:** Also known as the Faust generation (because of Lauren Faust, the executive producer), is the generation that has gained the huge fan following because of its unique animation style, excellent writing, good voice work, and catchy songs.

true,michiexile,null,null,"What sort of information are you looking for specifically? Just like bilbicus said, there's quite a few Swedes in Edinburgh, and some of us are reading this subreddit as well.

I've worked abroad for quite a number of years now, and I have lived in Edinburgh, worked in St Andrews for about a year now.

I moved here at the start of September last year. I had visited in July to meet my colleagues in St Andrews, meet friends in Edinburgh, and get started on apartments. After about a week's worth of emailing landlords and agencies, an agency got back to me suggesting I visit their office during my visit. Before that day was over, I had put down a deposit and secured an apartment to be available about 1 week after I was to start working.

One week in a B&amp;B, and then moving into a furnished apartment costing me about £460/m in rent, just under £600/m with council tax and utilities.

Once you get here — especially if you want to stay for a while (&gt;3 months I think) you'll need to register for council tax, and visit the JobCentre to get issued a National Insurance number. You'll also want to find a doctor and possibly a dentist early on. Intent for residence seems sufficient to get NHS coverage.

Moving into the UK, you'll not have a credit history locally. This will mess with you for getting banking setup, for getting phone contracts, and all sorts of things. I got Vodafone to take me on with a nice contract; I can no longer remember if I had to put in a deposit or not. I also recommend Rebtel for international calling: you register on their site, and get a UK phone number you can call to get re-routed with voice-over-IP to wherever. This way, international phone rates become a non-issue.

As for banking, I looked around quite a bit for sensible solutions. Bank of Scotland have an account they call the Easycash Account that has a far lower entry threshold. Fundamental problem is that you need to prove residency to get accounts, and you need an account to get salaries, and to wait until you get your first utilities bill can get obnoxiously late. There are workarounds using voter registration or tax registration, but I had a far easier time bringing my apartment lease to BoS and opening an Easycash account. Once you get proof of residency (typically a utility bill in your name), you can go back to their office and open up a more capable account.
The Easycash is severly limited — no overdrafts, no interest, no credit, severe fees if you bounce payments. But it gets you started, and within a month or two, you'll have accumulated enough trust with the bank to get a better setup.

I think this approximately covers the things that tripped me up in the beginning.

1. A new timeline. You live your life until you're 40. You're in a job that makes your whole life miserable but seemed ok when you started. Then you go into a time machine, go back and tell your 20 year old self not to take the job. *He* doesn't, but when *you* go back to when you're 40, you're still in the same job. Nothing's changed, because the change branched a new universe and the change was done in that other universe. If you kill Hitler then go back to present day, your world would still have Hitler.

2. Same timeline, nothing changes. When you're 20 you receive a visit from future you to tell you not to take the job. You don't. Then when you're 40 you get into a time machine to tell 20 year old you not to take the job, sort of self-fulfilling the whole thing. This way you cannot change anything about the past... not really... because whatever you go back to do would have already happened. You can't go back in time to kill Hitler because if you did then he would already have been killed by a traveler from the future. Get it?

I believe The Big Bang operates on the second paradox.

Incidentally, Hermione using the time travelling watch (?) to throw rocks at the window to alert her past ""herself"" in the hut in the forest also belongs to the second paradox. Past Hermione heard rocks on the window. Future Hermione has to go and throw rocks for past Hermione.

There's no ""which event came first?"" because time is going in full circle in paradoxes like this. To understand it you need to stop thinking of time as a linear progression and more of a ""wibbly wobbly thing"". Not only is this the greatest DW quote, it's also how you need to look at time to understand proper time travel theories.

They wanted to close Bridilington Hospital despite the fact that it was built entirely from funds raised by the people of the town when the old 1800's hospital was demolished. 

And now Scarborough is basically having to work 24hrs to keep up and has cash and care problems.

To add, they also bring a lot of costs on themselves.

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

on periodic roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers and repealing
Directive 2009/40/EC
(Text with EEA relevance)
{SWD(2012) 206 final}_{SWD(2012) 207 final}


(7) ‘vehicle of historic interest’ means any vehicle which fulfils all the following
conditions :

– It was manufactured at least 30 years ago,

– It is maintained by use of replacement parts which reproduce the historic
components of the vehicle;

– **It has not sustained any change in the technical characteristics of its main
components such as engine, brakes, steering or suspension and**

– It has not been changed in its appearance;

Recently there was a new spotlight shed on this issue by the convictions over Stephen Lawrence's murder, little was said to have changed from the time MacPherson originally reported.

But yes, you are correct there are racists in all walks of society. I agree in so far there are racists in the NHS, but the NHS is not institutionally/ideologically racist. I would also draw a distinction between your average racist (and lets face it, racism is a pretty dominant ideology in Western societies. Most people are a bit racist. That's a terrible thing, but it's also reality) and fascists. 

But the EDL have racist aims. Even you said an ""anti-islam protest group"". The point the EDL tried to convey originally in the media was that they were against 'Islamism', 'Islamofascism' etc. etc. Not Islam as a whole. But they manage to let the mask slip repeatedly, as you just did. And yes, I get the *technicality* that religion is not a race; but again, lets face up to the reality: Most Muslim people in the West are of Asian origin. So we move from just against 'Islamism', to against Islam, to against Asians. And the evidence of this is everywhere, not just in the occasional member but up and down the organisation from the leadership to your local EDL supporting football hooligan. There's also plenty of evidence of a wider racism against black people, anti-semitism and homophobia within the organisation.

You say there is a difference between the EDL and the BNP - there is in terms of organisation, tactics etc. - but if they have *completely* different aims I wonder why many EDL members were formally in the BNP, including their infamous leader Tommy Robinson?

Then there's all the points about the EDL increasingly becoming a fascist organisation proper, not just a gang of your run-of-the-mill racists. Saying one thing and in reality doing another is a hallmark of fascism. Shock, horror: Fascists lie.

You're not being downvoted for ""daring to voice an opinion"" (this is typical EDL rhetoric, drawn straight for their playbook: they are so brave for daring to say how evil Muslims are against the 'politically correct establishment'!). You're being downvoted for denying the obvious nature of what is a very dangerous fascist organisation with a deep-set ideological racism.

It just sets the limit of treatment as everything short of CPR, which is undignified and more often than not unsuccessful.  There are many good reasons not to resuscitate someone.  However, even without all the facts, this case seems iffy.

It's odd that the family weren't consulted at all, considering that they were apparently visiting every day.  If the patient is unable to give informed consent, a DNAR can be completed based on a clinical decision of the patient's best interests.  Legally, the family don't have any say but it's best practice to consult with them, especially to find out what the patient's quality of life is like at the moment and how detrimental CPR would be.

Down Syndrome in itself wouldn't be a sufficient reason in a 51-year-old unless it would reduce the chances of successful CPR (heart problems are common in people with Down Syndrome) or if it would contribute to a poor quality of life following CPR.

There's a difference between institutionally X and ideologically X. Institutionally now being a term which is applied when a certain percentage of members are found to be X, an application I disagree with terminologically but if we are to accept it then we must accept that the usage then varies from ideolically.

&gt;Even you said an ""anti-islam protest group"".

Nothing racist about opposition to religion.

&gt;Most Muslim people in the West are of Asian origin.

Right, but this is an organisation which is happy to have non-muslim members of any racial origin, and does.

&gt;There's also plenty of evidence of a wider racism against black people, anti-semitism and homophobia within the organisation.

The leader of the EDL has several relatives which are half-black, so while I don't doubt there are racists in the organisation, I would still argue it's not ideologically racist.

&gt;You say there is a difference between the EDL and the BNP - there is in terms of organisation, tactics etc. - but if they have completely different aims I wonder why many EDL members were formally in the BNP, including their infamous leader Tommy Robinson?

Perhaps the BNP represented the closest approximation of their views? Just like I'll probably vote for Labour next time because they adopt the closest approximation of my views, despite the fact that I really don't much like the party or many of their policies.

&gt;Then there's all the points about the EDL increasingly becoming a fascist organisation proper, not just a gang of your run-of-the-mill racists. Saying one thing and in reality doing another is a hallmark of fascism. Shock, horror: Fascists lie.

I don't buy this, Unite Against Fascism take the fact that the EDL will clash with them as a sign that they're fascists, but when groups like UAF go out specifically looking for a fight and then find one, I don't consider them any better than any of the extreme right.

Again, I don't buy the fascist angle, but you're welcome to actually bring some evidence if you'd like to.

Whatever your cause is in taking issue with my posts, you do it no favours by mis-representing the beliefs of others.

I merely said at the time they'd looked and didn't find grounds to reopen the investigation.  When new evidence came forward - they did.  You're taking a Boris quote made in the interim and trying to shoehorn it elsewhere.

&gt;There was plenty of evidence in the public arena, which he would have been well aware of, that the police may not be trustworthy on this issue.

Again, the police are not a homogeneous lump.

&gt; At the time the Deputy Mayor was not in charge of policing,

He was in charge of overseeing and asking questions of it.  Brian Paddock Lib Dem even stood up to argue that the Deputy Mayor's job was to ask such questions, and he was  Deputy Assistant Commissioner in the Met.  The question was simply asked if the resources put into the investigation were representative of the actual issue or the media hysteria.  As soon as it became clear that civil servants were involved the Mayor's office said that the full weight had to go behind the investigation because otherwise it would look bad.

&gt;The investigation went ahead without his blessing, since it didn't need it. He only spoke out in support once it was clear the game was up for NI.

Nobody said it needed his blessing.  He spoke out when it became clear that the scandal indeed spread wider, effectively retracting the question of whether the right resources were being put in.

You're trying to manufacture something here.   The fact remains the investigation went ahead, ultimately with their blessing whether they needed it not, and so far they haven't been implicated.

No, it is not a measure of quantity but of quality. I don't know where you got that from. The point of institutional racism is runs right through the organisation, from the rank and file to leadership and *breeds* and *reinforces*  racism in it's practices and norms

&gt;Right, but this is an organisation which is happy to have non-muslim members of any racial origin, and does.

And how many are there? They had one Sikh guy, who got threatened with excommunication for - er - being a part of a racist organisation. (here is what many Sikhs actually think of them: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sikhs-Against-the-EDL-English-Defence-League/102679703128596). Yes, the EDL pursued novel tactics that managed to draw in some people of other creeds/races. This strategy ran up against huge limits a long time ago becuase the organisation is riven top to bottom with racists.

&gt;The leader of the EDL has several relatives which are half-black, so while I don't doubt there are racists in the organisation, I would still argue it's not ideologically racist.

Honestly, this is getting pathetic. You can;t be a racist becuase you know (or are related to) a black person? Don't be so ridiculous.

&gt;Perhaps the BNP represented the closest approximation of their views? Just like I'll probably vote for Labour next time because they adopt the closest approximation of my views, despite the fact that I really don't much like the party or many of their policies.

These weren't just BNP voters, they were paid up members of the organisation. In some cases they had organisational roles. You might vote Labour (as I might) becuase they approximate yours/our views - I have huge problems with them but hate the Tories far more. I wouldn't dream of becoming an actual member.

&gt;I don't buy this, Unite Against Fascism take the fact that the EDL will clash with them as a sign that they're fascists, but when groups like UAF go out specifically looking for a fight and then find one, I don't consider them any better than any of the extreme right. Hell, the EDL have a good few times been much more peaceful and law abiding than their opposition.

I don't think you know what a fascist is. Fascism is not defined by whether or not someone is willing to use violence. I don't oppose the EDL simply becuase they have a proven record of violence, I oppose them becuase they have a proven record of violence against people becuase of their race and/or religion. It is not and has never been the position of UAF that it is simply the fact the EDL are willing to clash with them that defines them as fascists. The police also clash with UAF, and plenty of other groups in society, it does not make them a fascist organisation.

The fact the EDL have branched out from attacking just those of Asian origin to left wing groups (Trade union headquarters and the Occupy camps, notable) is, however, evidence of their increasingly fascist nature. This is typical fascist behaviour. 

&gt;Again, I don't buy the fascist angle, but you're welcome to actually bring some evidence if you'd like to. 

It's in the article if you bother to read it

I wonder how this works, becuase practically ever member of the organisation is a racist - attracted to it becuase of racist goals.

&gt; there just to stop other groups from saying something, which is all the UAF does.

I have absolutely no issue with this at all. I see no reason fascists should be given a platform to spread their bile in society. It's as if the 1930s never happened, and there are no lessons to be learned. As if all that needs to be done is to let them run riot, unopposed, unchallenged. In many places the left failed to oppose fascists properly in the 1930s, and they ended up sent to the slaughter. France would be an example now of an ineffective anti-fascist strategy (ignoring them) that has allowed Islamophobia to flourish and we've ended up with huge votes for the National Front. In Britain we're having a lot of success holding them back, and that is a vindication of the strategy of UAF.

Buckminster Fuller (who was a genius and a hero) once did a rather laborious calculation to try and figure out the actual cost to nature of making a gallon of oil, in terms of time and energy needed, and then trying to put a dollar sign on it.  He figured that to produce (from dead sea plankton to black gold), oil costs roughly a million dollars per gallon.  No wonder that it's not difficult to sell it at $100 per barrel!

It's almost like being brothers who can't stop fighting, but deep down they're still Brothers. The Doctor probably feels this more, especially since he's struggling with the whole ""last of my kind"" thing. But I think in this moment, the Master chose to save his old friend and take revenge on the dicks who put him through years of torment for their own purposes. I think after that, he'd still be his old, evil, crazy self.

&gt;&gt;I'm not. The only person that said that was you!

&gt;Please don't call me a liar like that. Boris said it in Sept 2010. 

You then go to link that the official line was that,  

             ""I think it's patently politically motivated unless 
             there is significant new facts brought into the 
             public domain that actually change the police case, 
             or the potential will make necessary a fresh look at it, 
             then I don't propose to change my view.""

That was the official line which you linked to!!!  I wasn't repeating a fallacy.  You were.  If you then want to take 'codswallop', which I didn't say, and what Boris did say, out of context and chronology, then you are being dishonest.

&gt;By late 2010 it was clear that NI's corruption reached high up into the Met. This is a very good reason not to trust reports coming out of the Met.

This is just naive to suggest that the police inquiry into itself was equally compromised - it also turns out you have nothing to back it up.

&gt;I mean, it was clear by 2009. Though anyone paying attention was aware of many of these allegations by 2006 or earlier. 

Again, allegations, and the mayor has to allow the system set up to address these matters to work.  As it turned out it looks like the investigation has worked, is working.

&gt;I'm not manufacturing anything. 

Well you just linked to a video and chose to omit the pertinent thing which I said was Boris' official line at the time when addressing the London Assembly.

The police looked into it and said there was nowhere for an investigation to go unless someone or something else comes forward with new information.  Someone did, the investigation was re-oppened and the mayor supported it.  Ken Livingstone was running around making similar allegations but the sensible line was 'what new facts do you bring forward so then the position can be reassessed?'

The mayor was simply working with facts available at the time.

true,Prairie_Dog,cyberman,Cyberperson,"Classic Who generally didn't have the season-long story arcs we see in the reboot, so watching order isn't as important. There were some exceptions like the Trial of a Time Lord season, or the E-Space Trilogy. So, unless you are in one of the rare series, don't feel you must watch things in a completely linear fashion.

Now, I certainly wouldn't start before the Third Doctor. This is when the show started being filmed in color, and there are no missing or partially reconstructed episodes from this point to present. You can always go back and watch the First and Second Doctors later on. 

The Fourth Doctor is a fan favorite, and had the longest run of any Doctor. He had some of the best episodes in the classic period,  but also some pretty lame episodes. It's hard to go wrong suggesting him as a starting point. In any case, I would strongly suggest you should sample some of his best episodes.

The Fifth Doctor is also one of my favorites, he generally had a lot of companions, and was a more serious and almost fatherly figure. His run had somewhat better effects and writing.

The Sixth Doctor's run was cut short by the BBC, and his character wasn't as fully developed as it should have been. However, I think the Trial of a Time Lord season was some of the best effects and stories of the late classic period.

I personally don't care for the Seventh Doctor. He also had a pretty short run before the BBC cancelled the show, so we never got to see his character develop. He was supposed to be a darker and more serious Doctor. He does have a cool companion, Ace, who I liked a lot.

The Eighth Doctor is an easy one to start with as he is only represented on screen by the 1996 ""Doctor Who: The Movie"" which was intended to be the pilot for a reboot that didn't happen.

Look at the types of people that rise to positions of power, overwhelming male, overwhelmingly white, overwhelmingly of a monied background. I don't think a good definition of multiculturism is based around the number of coloured faces you might see on your way to work, or whilst there.

Immigration is an explosive issue, and outside graduates who befriend foreign students their isn't much meaningful empathy or exchange elsewhere. Other cultures are generally accepted when they lose identity and become anglo-saxonised: you wave the flag, watch football, support the monarchy, drive a car, support ""our troops"", that sort of thing. European scepticism is significant, and behaviour around sporting events is telling. The national press cannot let a Germany match go by without reminding us of the Great War. Another example was the nasty rhetoric about the ""immoral"" Greeks for not paying their debts that came from our politicians. The other way one can get acceptance is by becoming a chain fast food outlet selling unhealthy products.

There are some areas you could point to, perhaps music, Sport or TV, but taking the dominant portrayal of Britain (Eastenders and Coronation Street), there might be the odd face, but I don't really see much cultural exploration. I imagine if two muslims ever speaking on prime time in arabic with subtitles over the top would be a massive culture shock.

Galloway is another interesting example. He's probably a converted muslim, but he cannot dare be visibly so. The same goes for any muslim politician (not that there are many), they would not get away with arabian dress (for want of the appropriate adjective) opting for the sterile suit and tie. And for black woman, neat straightened hair and again suited. Could you imagine a muslim politician ever getting away with praising Allah in a speech in the same way Cameron invokes the christian God? The same applies for any news reader (look at Moira Stewart). The only way to get ahead is to ""out white"" the competition.

The number of people chomping at the bit surrounding the grooming of young girls looking for an excuse was alarming. We have had multiple racial tensions in recent times and the cultural indifference to the numerous Iraqi deaths is also significant. There really are no go drinking areas for people of colour.

By virtue of their location other EU countries have multiple languages in concurrent use, at least at the edges, thus they is a greater scope of meaningful interaction. The UK has the British press, British Tv, and the Costa del Inglés. The xenophobia that afflicts the UK is really more one of ideas, it really is anti-intellectual. The UK can't even be tolerant of the bicycle. That includes infrastructure but more alarmingly passive aggression is a daily occurrence and open aggression is perhaps one in ten days of cycling.

Hi -censored-,

Thank you for your email.

Unfortunately due to the amount of requests we receive, we are unable to arrange for any player meetings. As you can imagine, the players have very strict schedules before and after games and therefore we are unable to accommodate your request.

Where time allows, and also depending on where the team bus is positioned near the East Stand Reception, the players do usually make their best efforts to sign for fans before departing away from the stadium, however it's not always possible. The players always appreciate your loyal support and the distance you travel to cheer them on.

Kind Regards,
Katie@Enquiries

*'In the past they would reject anyone with anything below a C Grade for A-level courses but will assess on an individual basis anyone who received a grade D in English.'*

The exam boards need to learn that once you have set marking criteria for exams at the start of the year, you can't then just go and change them a few weeks before the exams. You can't just move the goalposts on a whim. 

January exams and June exams in the same year should follow the exact same marking criteria and marking method. If you want to change anything, do it at the start of the academic year (September) and alert the schools and colleges to the changes so they can prepare their students.

true,tangled_foot,uk,The Toon,"I know what the fuse is for, its got nothing to do with electric grids, its actually a very good idea, I shall explain, you should know this anyway, its important.

The circuit breaker (or in old houses fuse box) works for that specific wiring loop in your house, i.e. upstairs downstairs, lights etc. The kitchen usually has its own loop because of all the high powered stuff in it. 

So if the power drawn on a certain loop is greater than the value of that circuit breaker, it switches, circuit breakers are usually set at 32A. It has to be this high so you can use lots of devices on one loop. Some people experience the circuit breaker tripping when they plug in an iron in their living room and they have a powerful TV because the total drawn on that loop is more than 32A (This is explained in more detail [here](http://www.ehow.com/how_5018947_determine-size-circuit-breaker-need.html))

Every home in the UK has a circuit breaker or if your home is really old fuse box (but you hardly ever see them any more), it is a legal requirement of having your home connected to mains electricity. 

Now, a plug fuse is 3 or 13A depending on the appliance, this is really high for an individual appliance, but obviously substantially lower than the 32A loop circuit breaker.

There are two reasons to have a fuse in a plug over just a circuit breaker

1. If one device blows a plug fuse only that device will stop working, its annoying if you plug in a faulty hifi and all your lights turn off.

2. If a device malfunctions and draws too much current, but doesn't get to 32A your circuit breaker won't go, but you're still running a faulty device, which could heat up and start a fire, the 13A fuse is much lower, so is *far* more likely to blow. If you plug in something and the fuse blows, bin it, or if its expensive get it fixed. this is the massive wave your hands in the air reason why we have fuses in our plugs, at 240V, you shouldn't mess around.

So, your kettle breaking was enough to hit the circuit breaker, that's pretty extreme, and you're right in the UK that wouldn't have taken out the circuit breaker it would have taken out the fuse in the plug, but as you also said, the kettle was screwed, and you needed a new kettle, so its not an issue (just for info you can buy fuses at every supermarket, corner shop, diy shop, off license etc, they're usually behind the counter, they cost about 50p for 10).

true,othersomethings,tardis,TARDIS,"I've been thinking for awhile about how they got the material to look like that, and how it could be reproduced. I think you could start with a slightly too large suit, and use a stiffening solution. 

I'd do it like this: fill large tub (bathtub would work well) 2 inches deep with a very heavy starch and water solution (I'll comment in a minute about other possible solutions) and soak the suit. Then I'd use a tube an feed the suit piece into it so that it is very snug, and leave it for awhile. Probably several hours, because you want the wrinkles to be strong. But it still needs to be damp, can't let it dry out yet. Then I'd take it out of the tube and hang it on a hanger to air dry (probably still over the tub if it's still wet enough to drip) and possibly put something in the sleeves/legs to keep it from sealing off and sticking together. 

The material for the suit has to be just right - you'll want to visit a thrift shop probably and find a suit that matches the description and size, but look for one that has some good creased wrinkles in it because then you know it will hold them. Some fabrics are designed to not wrinkle and that would really defeat the purpose. you might want to make some variations to how you apply the wrinkles, because you want them to be small and consistent and that is going to be VERY difficult to achieve. 

Some other solutions to use, besides a home-made starch (which I would google or ratios, btw) would be fabric glue or possibly even Elmer's type glue - or there may be some stuff at your local fabric store that could do the trick. The thing with the glue that would concern me is it would be very difficult to keep the suit ""wearable"" and not have it seal off or stick to itself or to what you have holding it open during the dryin process. Those are all problems that could be worked through though. 

I love the mask! I don't have plans to make one, but as you can see, I've been thinking about it for a bit now and I love that you're going for it.

true,MiniPenguino,lfc99,,"Let me explain quickly why I don't agree with this. 

- The Red Sox just traded away $120 Millions dollars of Salary space leaving for huge construction of a new team.
- FSG has created this that is now in a stage where no buyer would want to come in. They are finishing the season in one of the worst positions in the last decade and they have an unstable clubhouse.
- They are continuing redevelopment of Fenway Park and have already spent more money before seeing an end result.

Yes, FSG will probably sell the Red Sox, but not now. They will be sold once the Red Sox become the most valuable Baseball Franchise in America. That way they can maximize profits.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Right. We played defensively under RDM. Apart from the two Barcelona legs and the Bayern game, where did we play defensively? Would those stand out as the anomaly rather than the norm? Any evidence for ""Lampard just fucking off"" or is this another aspect of his game that has been imagined by his detractors? I'd invite you to actually watch him, rather than trying to see what you want to. The role of the CMs in the 4-2-3-1 isn't to sit in front of the back four and not move, it's to provide the ""3"" with the ball, to link play between the defense and the attackers as well as providing cover. Your own misunderstanding of the role (and probably hence your admonishment of Lampard for ""fucking off up front"") is your own fault. 

Newcastle - didn't play. Meireles played well, fair enough. Reading - one deflected free kick and a ridiculous header were pretty much their only chances. Atletico - shambles all round. Pretty small statistical group to base your ""Lampard can't play in a 4-2-3-1"" contention as opposed to most of last season, no?

The Lampard/Gerrard comparison is a massive red herring/straw man/whatever the in vogue term is these days.

It becomes worse and worse with every underlying condition you have and, like I said, those with Down Syndrome are prone to conditions that would lead to a worse outcome in the long run.  Obviously I don't know the details of the man in this case but it could have been a factor in the decision.  Ultimately, even if it was, it wasn't recorded as such so it becomes irrelevant.

I think the family should be involved with these decisions, it's just that legally, they aren't recognised as able to make these decisions unless they have been appointed as a proxy beforehand.

I meant the dignity thing as more of a generalisation.  It isn't dignified to have someone hammering your chest and breaking your ribs (the sign of effective CPR) while another stabs you to take blood and put drips in.  Not to mention being periodically electrocuted and the general chaos surrounding you.

If it works and the patient pulls through, I would agree that it was worth it.  In patients where it's very unlikely to work or, if it does, where they won't get an intensive care bed*, some would prefer to die peacefully.  In these cases, the discussion must absolutely be had with the patient beforehand.

I must clarify that, certainly everywhere I've worked, DNRs are only signed by consultant doctors.

*If you've gone into cardiorespiratory arrest, you're probably going to need a higher level of care afterwards.  Unfortunately, ICUs have limited numbers of beds and will refuse to accept patients who are unlikely to recover and leave, typically older people with several medical problems such as heart or lung disease.

&gt;They use the fact you can manage to get to work to say your disability has miraculously disappeared and now you don’t need any help or support.

&gt;The most ridiculous thing of all is that many people rely on the mobility part of DLA to get to work and without it they have to give up their jobs.

I also really miss Rose's wardrobe. Shes like a real person. She has a home, and a family, and they're watching about a UFO crash on TV. And the give and take between her and the Doctor is always fun.

They actually got rid of $260 million in salary obligations, and this makes the team MUCH more attractive to potential buyers.  Would you rather buy a business that has or does not have an additional $260 million in liabilities?

&gt; FSG has created this that is now in a stage where no buyer would want to come in. 

Nope.  If anything, a deep-pocketed new owner would love to come in essentially with a clean slate with which to build their own team.  The Red Sox are also the second most valuable baseball brand in the US, despite their underperformance this season.


&gt; They are continuing redevelopment of Fenway Park and have already spent more money before seeing an end result.

Redevelopment of Fenway Park has been finished for 18 months, and trust me - as a customer who's paying to go to there, they're making their investment back and then some.


&gt; Yes, FSG will probably sell the Red Sox, but not now. 

FSG will sell the Red Sox when they feel they can get the best price for the team.  The Los Angeles Dodgers just sold for $2.15 billion, driving franchise values through the roof.

&gt; They will be sold once the Red Sox become the most valuable Baseball Franchise in America.

This will never, ever happen.  The NY Yankees will always be the most valuable baseball franchise in the US.

true,railu,tennant,Tennant,"I think you're conflating how the character of the Doctor would view relationships with how humans would.

The Doctor doesn't view sexuality the same way humans do.  How could he?  Think about it; to a timelord, what's the difference between being 100 years old and 1000 years old (aside from just being 900 years apart)?  The Doctor himself said that he 'dances' (writers' code for sex in the Who universe) and even 'danced' with Madame De Pompadour, who was only 23; whom he clearly fell in love with, even if just briefly.  

If you think about the character and how he must view people and romance and sexuality, it must all blur together in his eyes.  Even right off the bat in episode 2, he's unabashedly attracted to a tree woman.  I'm sorry, but when you're attracted to a sentient plant-based life form, it's not a far cry to think he'd be interested in a 20-something earth girl.  The Doctor wouldn't view aging the way we do because he doesn't age the way we do (he doesn't really age at all, he just becomes chronologically older), so why would he use our concept of age differences as a barrier for a relationship?  The reason he rejected Amy is because he didn't see her that way (in his mind, she's still the 7 year old girl) and he wanted to stop her from making the mistake of throwing away her marriage for an affair that wouldn't last.

It is very clear that the Doctor can feel the whole range of human emotions as he has demonstrated in all of his incarnations.  And of all of them, his feelings of love are probably the most downplayed.

true,cylinderhead,null,null,"There's a lot of conflicting advice out there, but here's my take. I work for a company with around 5k employees; I see a lot of CVs and recruitment is an occasional part of my job, but I'm not a recruitment professional by any means.

Bear in mind the following assumes you are tailoring your CV to a particular application, according to the criteria stated in that vacancy. 

If you're shotgunning your CV, good luck, but the employment situation in the UK is not great, and there are very few full time, open ended vacancies. A general approach might be frustrating in the long run, especially if it's unsolicited and you're not writing to a named contact.

1. My CV is two pages. It's the right length for me. Outside of specialist or very senior posts, your CV will be reviewed by someone who is unlikely to dedicate a lot of time to reading it, so brief is best. Never include a date of birth (because of the Equality Act) or a photo. 

2. Bullet points with brief descriptions are ideal and are what I would recommend. Bullet point to focus the attention, description to introduce the keywords and phrases, lock down the relevant criteria in the job description. You find them easier to read and so does everyone else.

3. The UKBA are putting recruiters into a cold sweat and they keep changing the rules. Make sure you state, first up, that you can provide evidence of your eligibility to work. I'd say save the expiry date for the interview. If you can get specialist advice on this, do.

4. No, I don't think it will help to explain your high school marks. If recruiters are interested in GCSE level marks, it's usually for math and English. A-levels are more significant but you have a Masters, so your undergraduate and postgraduate degrees should be the focus. As long as you can demonstrate that you have relevant education and/or experience, that should be enough.

5. Recruiters? You mean like employment agencies? It really depends on your field and what you're looking for. Generally speaking, if you can go directly to the employer, do. My experience with agencies has been poor, as a job seeker. In my current job, we get hundreds of calls from agencies and tell them all the same thing, that we have our own recruitment provisions and work with selected partner companies.

4. If there's an equivalent qualification which says you're competent at reading, writing and arithmetic, mention it in your education.
