The issue I have, though, is the fact that there seems to be an inherent class-system when it comes to immigration. People who come *in* to the UK, for some reason, are labelled as ""immigrants"", often in the most negative way possible. People who *leave* the country (for instance, to go and join friends and family as they slowly but surely Anglicise regions of Spain) are, however, called ""ex-pats"". In the same light, it seems to be fine for ""ex-pats"" to enter another land and build their own communities and have their own customs without learning the local language or doing any work, but it doesn't seem to be okay for ""immigrants"" to do the same, which has always puzzled me.",0,1355058654,null,0,false,0,c7dnoum,t3_14jksv,t1_c7dnoum,t3_14jksv,null,1430621905,6,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,6

I guess for our midfielders (including wingers), we'll have Gerrard, Allen, Lucas, Sterling, Enrique (?). Or we might have a surprise inclusion of Assaidi, I don't think he travelled to Italy. Back four should be standard, Johnson-Agger-Skrtel-Wisdom, unless we see Assaidi or someone else on the wing, then we might see Enrique on the left instead of Johnson and Wisdom on the right. Our man up front will almost definitely be Shelvey, but I'm wondering if he'd get subbed out later on, and if so, who for?

I hope we'll see Enrique as a winger, he's really good there. Like, really good. He makes those powerful runs into the box that we need. I might want to see him on the RW, perhaps kind of as an inside forward, just to see what he can do there when he can shoot with his left.

He's clearly 4th and falling to 5th placed in the striker pecking order for me. Would much rather Guidetti get picked for a few games rather than Balotelli. His attitude sucks and I don't like it. 

A 6 point lead is definitely not the end of the world. United threw away their 8 point lead last year and we came back, and we threw away our lead too. Not even halfway through. 

as much as losing to united sucks, they're a top team and we will grow from this. Both teams played well and both deserved to win. very enjoyable match.

true,caprosmaster,nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"I'm currently at Nottingham uni, so can give a bit of insight as to that one I think.


Firstly, I've seen comments in this thread saying that UCL is the best on that list - and that's probably right. Nottingham is probably the second best on that list, to give you an idea. It is part of the Russel group - a group of 22 I think it is now unis, arguably the best ones.


The main UK campus, University Park is really really nice in terms of buildings and scenery, so if you want somewhere nice to live, that's worth considering. Speaking of living, campus accommodation is all catered. There is accommodation off campus, which is self catered - the largest one is about 100m from Campus, and about 10minutes from there to the main block of academic buildings. 


The catered food isn't terribly bad, to be fair, and it is easy for me being in my first year to just not have to worry about what I'm eating/cooking that night, after having a day of 9-5 lectures. It's a two week menu, so whilst there is some variation, I find that Chicken of some sort, and potatoes of some sort seems to the norm... Breakfasts are pretty good, and for lunch, you get £5.10 on your student card which can be spent at a variety of places on campus.


As to Nottingham as more of a city, you'll doubtlessly hear from lots of places that it's ""Shottingham"" and other such things. Honestly, from what I've seen, it's like any other major city in the UK. If you're out late at night(and there is a fair few good nights out, if you're into that thing,) expect to see some drunken idiots, but as long as you keep yourself to yourself and are clued on, it won't be an issue. Don't let crime rates deter you from Nottingham, if you're ever worried about that.


I'll stop here before it gets too long, if you have any other questions you'd like answered, reply here or just PM me :)

true,SloppySixteenths,king,,"playing devil's advocate a bit - i think the subs were pretty strange. we ended up with an entirely different midfield for the last 10 or so minutes. falque on the right (i think?), and gylfi behind adebayor isn't something we've done much (or at all) this year. and bringing on hudds to protect leads hasn't worked well before. 

i'm not saying that's what led to the goals directly, but it couldn't have helped. whatever cohesion we had in the midfield before got completely shuffled by the substitutions, and i think it could have been part of the reason that our defense looked completely out of place in the final few minutes. 

why not leave lennon on? or even dembele - with no midweek games coming up, surely he could have made it 10 more minutes? i guess hindsight's 20/20, but still. 

i love AVB, but the decisions he made today have me a bit confused. he didn't lose us the game by any means, and i realize injuries limit his options a bit - but i still don't think his substitutions made a ton of sense.

I don't know why/how people are suggesting we were poor today. Brendan showed us today that his philosophy is the way that we need to be playing. We pulled a Barcelona today. 

Yeah, that needs explaining, so here it goes:

For 60-70 minutes, we were outmuscled, outran, out fought, and outplayed. Gerrard was forced to bear the load for servicing Shelvey and the Hammers midfield crowded him out. Shelvey played like a midfielder playing as a striker.

At 2-1 down he takes off our defensive screen in Lucas, a player responsible for time and time again breaking off the Hammers counterattack, and goes for the jugular with Henderson. 

At this point, we are starting to see the true merits of our playing style. 

All game long, Allen, Lucas, Gerrard, Shelvey, Sterling, Joe Cole, Johnson, were all eschewing chance creation for possession and a passing game. Henderson comes on and kicks us into a full fledged attacking mode and what do you know, we score 2 and win. The Hammers are too tired to keep up with the dynamicism injected by Henderson, and our quality up front wins us the game. 

TLDR: We wore them down using tiki-taka. 

MOTM: Johnson. That goal was beautiful, he was the best attacker on the team in the first half. Our second half attacks were concentrated through the left hand side, but he was always pulling their defense wider with his continued presence near the touchline.

true,Lokopopz,lfc99,,"Try my hand at this malarky:

As a team, i felt we had two good 20 minutes spells, in the first 20 and the last 20, in the middle 50 minutes we just sort of, didn't turn up, the passing game went a miss and we were too loose in defence and didn't make any decent chances up front. But yeah, when we turned it on, the passing was slick, the goals were sexy and we defended well. 

Saying that, West Ham's two goals came from nothing really, a harsh penalty and an unlucky own goal, they didn't make that much at all.


* *Reina*: Played reasonably well i thought, dominated the box and made a lot of good clearances, two goals that he couldn't do much about. So yeah, 6/10. 

* *Downing*: Good whole game i thought, dangerous crosses, decent at the back. Think he was a bit miffed to be moved to LB, but he coped well. Again. 6/10.

* *SKAGGER*: Skrtel a brick as always, that round shiny dome is just a heading machine. Didn't see him lose many 1 on 1s and just bossed their players and kept them quiet. Agger loves to get forward and again had a good game. 2 goals seems like they did a poor job but they were out of their hands really. Kept a very physical team quiet. 8/10. 

* *Glen ""I'm really good at football"" Johnson*: Smashing first goal, bombed up and down the right like a madman, looked unplayable in the first 20, and then just put a shift in defensively. MOTM contender certainly. 9/10

* *Gerrard*: At times looked like he was bossing it all over the shop, at others looked dejected. Spread play nicely and kept the game ticking over, wish he would shoot more these days though, he's still got that thunderboot hidden up his sleeve. 7/10. 

* *Lucas*: Didn't even notice he was playing, which is an absolute credit to him, he was breaking up play and passing the ball around really well. Doing the job that makes this system work for him. 7/10

* *Allen*: Got forward more and was looking to make more incisive passes, was caught in two minds on the edge of the box whether to shoot or pass to Raheem, sort of did neither and squandered a decent chance, but again, apart from that, always looking for the ball and always looking to bring people into the game. 7/10.

* *Sterling*: Thought that he looked sharp for most of the game, but he sort of got bossed out of it in the middle, confidence dipped, everyone's head went down and he looked a bit sluggish, but after half time, looked keen and was involved in everything good about our attacking play. Hard to remember that he just turned 18 yesterday! He had some really good chances, could've scored 2 or 3, but the pass to assist Cole was sublime and his pace is something else. MOTM contender 8/10.

* *Joe ""i get paid too much money"" Cole*: Came on after 30 minutes, and took awhile to get into the game, but a really well taken goal and looks like he wants to be playing football, i think we should embrace him for that. Put a good shift in and sparked us getting back into the game 7/10 

* *Shelvey*: Big ask of him to play a tough role and fill in Luis' boots, but he did it well, first half was fairly forgettable, but the last 20 he looked really good. Cheeky little runs, some great footwork, good to get on the scoresheet (although it looked like an OG?) Denied a clear penalty. (Ref had a shocker). When it all started to click he looked competent playing up front. 8/10

*subs* 


* *Henderson*: Came on and changed the complexion of the game, looked really keen to just get the ball and make things happen, good balls into the box. Showed his versatility and capability. Don't think BR has got a fixed position for him yet, but it's nice to have someone that can put in a good shift all over the park. 7/10

* *Enrique*: Shame that he got a tight hamstring, but better to be safe than sorry, recently been one of our best players in the forward role, having been put back to LB I was a tad disappointed. But he looked decent for his 30, didn't really play enough to get a rating. 

* *Coates*: Only played 9 minutes, wish he could play more, but came on to deal with the aerial bombardment and he helped out certainly.

Overall i think we could've won more comfortably in the end, but that's back to back BPL wins and 3 wins on the trot including Udinese (and that's 2 tough away games.) So things are looking better for us. A striker in January and we'll be in a much better place. But for now we just need to keep plugging away and turn up and try and dominate for the full 90.

In the graveyard of the rebuilt church there are row after row of headstones with the same date on them in 1944, it was that night.

Despite the utter devastation which he witnessed to his friends and neighbours, he maintained a deep hatred of the Nazis, to the extent that a wounded airman who parachuted onto his land soon after this bombing was cared for, given medication and contact made with the resistance which saw him repatriated back to England. He also told me that almost all of the people he knew felt the same about the Nazis.

I see it as 2 main reasons: tactical changes and lack of fitness.

*Fitness*: We play a high line and press very hard the whole game, and it seems our team is always tired by the end of matches.  Maybe it's a lack of fitness, maybe it's not, but I still think fatigue has a lot to do 
with it.

*Tactics*: We seem to always try to protect leads rather than get insurance goals.  Subbing on defensive-minded players when we are up by 1 goal has bit us in the ass over and over again this season.

true,Stratocaster89,lfcflame,,"I'll just highlight key points 

Agger, wasnt his usual sturdy self got turned by cole a couple of times, but i think Skrtel having a good game made him look poorer than he actually was.

Sterling was bossed out of the game. He never rose up against the west ham bullies, and subsequently dropped off the game. His confidence got shot, then he was giving the ball away cheaply as a result. Soon as he got that assist though he came back to life. Should have scored at the end though when he knocked it too far ahead.

Shelvey did great imo. Its not his role, but he ran all day and never gave up. 

Downing is downing. Dissapointing as always, no idea, no creativity, terrible deliveries. Wasnt bad defensively though.

Lucas/Allen/Gerrard not great, but definitely not bad. Very apparent Gerrards legs are gone, he gave up on a few balls he would have easily made two years ago.

Reina doesnt inspire confidence in me any longer. Came bounding out to punch the ball 3 times and barely got anything on it. Starting to worry me, Didnt have a whole lot else to do to be fair.

Cole, gave the ball away with his first 3 touches. Then gave the ball away about 10times before i got tired of keeping track. Imo he was the wrong choice to bring on for enrique. Henderson should have been on, and proved why when he came on and changed the game. Cole offers very little, and did nothing positive other than score a fucking great goal.

Henderson, if he'd had more game time i'd give him motm as he was what we needed. More drive and effort once he came on and we got the goal. 

Very very poor match between 10mins and 70mins. We barely deserved to win, although west ham definitely didnt deserve to win.
I just wish they had the motivation and confidence they showed as soon as we drew level. Thats whats needed to be top 4 material, and we're not showing it enough. ",0,1355078894,null,0,false,0,c7drsqd,t3_14jz3o,t1_c7drsqd,t3_14jz3o,null,1430623840,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Johnson 8- Excellent workrate and solid defending as usual, was a monster in the first 15 minutes and scored an incredible strike

Skrtel/Agger 8- Could do nothing about both goals, dealt superbly with the tremendous pressure West Ham placed in our box

Enrique - subbed off too early to make anything out of his performance

Downing 6 - Did okay. Had a few good moments but also a couple of bad ones.

Sterling 5- Had a great assist to joe cole, but played terribly otherwise. So frustrating watching him give the ball away time and time again. Scuffed two good chances as well. His touch and confidence seems to have gone down in the past few games

Lucas 7- Thank god for Lucas. Seemed to be the only liverpool midfielder who could be bothered to provide some fucking cover for our defence and the only one who could stand up to diame.

Gerrard 5- Another ""i-can't-be-arsed"" performance from gerrard. Too lazy to close down and defend against West Ham's midfield, had a bright 15 minutes and then a very poor 75 minutes. No energy, no composure, no leadership, no cover for our defence, pissed the ball away so many times

Allen 4- Ugh, i can't stand watching allen these days. He was excellent at the start of his liverpool career, but now he looks like a salif diao that can't defend. defensively he is a shambles, no strength/speed/tackling ability or defensive intelligence. ipissed the ball away so many times. I honestly think jay spearing would have done a better job. 

Shevley 7- Seemed a little lost but can't be faulted for that. Tried his hardest, did a decent job in an unfamiliar position and it was his hard work that won us the third goal.

Subs

Joe cole 7 - Came on for an injured enrique early in the first half. Seemed to be the only liverpool midfielder (bar lucas) that belonged out there really. Was the only liverpool player that could actually hold on to the ball under pressure from west ham players in the final third and the only one who didn't resort to mindlessly lobbing the ball into the box hoping for something to happen. Also scored a goal with an excellent finish

Hendo 7 - Came on for lucas in the middle of the second half. Provided plenty of energy in the midfield which we sorely lacked (Gerrard and allen too busy walking), pressed, passed, and defended well. Also played an excellent ball into the West Ham box for our third goal.

Coates - Came on too late to make anything out of his performance

Overall Team Performance 6- Had a tremendous first fifteen minutes where we absolutely dominated west ham and led through glen johnson's superb strike. 

West Ham got back into the game because 1. diame is a beast and 2. our midfielders (bar lucas) couldn't be arsed to close down. West ham players had so much time and space to play the ball which created so much pressure for our defence. Our defence did brilliantly to repel West Ham's pressure, but they could do absolutely nothing about Allen's handball and Gerrard's own goal.

We had a couple of chances/half-chances as well but couldn't quite finish them

Thank god for diame's injury in the second half. Once he was taken off, we suddenly gained control of the midfield  (diame absolutely smashed allen and gerrard time and time again when he was playing) and created enough pressure to score two goals and win the FUCKING GAME GODAAMN YEAAA

I think the Lennon sub was made partly because Lennon had been fairly useless up to that point: he lacked the physicality to do anything against Everton, and his speed just wasn't working out for him. Huddlefro is a more defensively-minded player who could fix the Lennon-shaped gap, and still do a little of the playmaker role, too. If he'd been at all decent at completing passes, then it would've made the midfield a little more dynamic and gotten rid of a weak player.  
  
Falque for Defoe, I think, was more because at that point Defoe had become pretty superfluous to the game. With five minutes to go, André subbed out a forward and put on a forward-minded midfielder, which helped keep some control in midfield better, but didn't remove the attacking threat entirely.

* Oswin was alone for a minute or two between when the force field went down and the asylum being destroyed.

The whole point of her character was that her *mind* was still human even when her body was Dalek, so who cares that her body was destroyed?  She could have uploaded herself and ended up as a Flesh or a Nestene Duplicate or anything else.

* The Doctor's personal timeline doesn't include anything with Oswin after he leaves her room.  We, the viewers, don't see Oswin again after he runs out (either her Dalek shell or her dream world).  Weird that they don't cut back one last time before she gets blown up, right?  Unless they were deliberately leaving that unseen because the Doctor *returns* to the room in the TARDIS much later in his personal timeline (end of the Christmas special, maybe?)  After that the whole Flesh / Nestene approach actually becomes much easier to pull off, since the Doctor has met both and knows exactly where and when to go to get her a real proper body.  They could even leave Oswin's original body alive as a Dalek (in some TARDIS back room, or a permanent fixture on the main deck?) while her consciousness walks around in a Flesh body.  We've had a Nestene companion for over a year now, so I'm betting on Flesh as the more likely option.

true,Brodiaq,null,null,"Today was soul crushing disappointment. To be so close and have it all ripped away is miserable. But we'll soldier on through this and hopefully come out the better. 

Our Defense looked pretty solid today for 99% of the match. Walker's form has continued to improve and today he was tested defensively and he held up his end of the bargain, and he was acceptable going forward. Caulker and Gallas were solid up until the last few moments, Gallas had a couple lucky moments where Everton players made mistakes that he was able to make plays on, but overall were good enough, just hard to forgive them for totally falling apart at the end. Super Jan was actually who I thought looked weakest overall the whole game. He bombed forward a little too aggressively at times, and being out of his natural position really shows when he is left alone when Dempsey drifted towards the center. I don't think either of them are at fault for that, I imagine that was part of the plan to have Dempsey drift in, and they put alot of responsibility on Vert. Either way he defended fine, and managed to do his job, even if the left looked the more vulnerable. 

Our midfield looked really good at times. Especially when pressing forward we managed to hold onto possession and probe for openings. We didn't find many, but I put that more on great defending from Everton. I thought Dempsey did a good job sliding in the left, admittedly early on I thought he got caught out of position defensively a bit too much, but as the game went on I thought he managed his attacking positions very well and with his high work rate, got better defensively as the game went on. He had a good game, scored a goal, did well to keep possession at times and won a decent number of free kicks. Sandro was his regular defensive beast, did a decent job not losing possession too much and won the ball back. Notably he took 2 or three shots on that I don't think he would have before scoring that goal against Fulham. I like it. Dembele looked great. Passing was on, made some Everton players look silly, and generally worked the midfield. Probably the best looking player out there today. The way he glides when he has the ball is just amazing. Hopefully his limp at the end isn't anything too serious. Lennon had a quiet day. Didn't really dribble at any defenders and never got a chance to show off his speed on Everton's side of the pitch. Took care of business in defense though, so credit him for that. 

Up top Adebayor and Defoe were quiet. Honestly they were the worst part of our game I think. I'm basing this off of the fact I can really only remember 1 or 2 things from Defoe (One being his run back to defend, the other just his newfound penchant for looking for a pass.) and nothing from Adebayor besides his terrible first touch. Neither did anything particularly notable, and you can try to blame the midfield having bad service but I don't think that was it. I blame Adebayor more than defoe. 

Our free kicks are still lacking. Walker will have a decent free kick every other time he tries atit, but still we should be making real chances out of these, half our corners/ free kicks are grossly over hit or under hit. Dempsey had a decent attempt on goal from a free kick, but it still didn't trouble Howard all that much. 

The Subs made sense. Siggy in for Defoe for better possession, Huddlefro for Dembele since he was limping and just came of from an injury, Falque for Lennon was a little weird, I assume AVB saw something we didn't or felt Lennon was too tired and just wanted some fresh legs out there. 

Not sure who my motm is. Our back line was solid until it wasn't, Lennon didn't do much anything notable. Our people up top did nothing. Probably down to Dembele or Dempsey, Dempsey kept his head forward worked harder than anyone I think, kept possession well, and had his goal, but was caught out position a few times. Dembele bossed the midfield, was great on the ball, and did his job well, but didn't have too many ""big"" plays I can think of, but when he came off we did look much worse. 

Goodison Park is a hard place to win, just wish we didn't lose like we did.

Hendo was definitely a game changer when he came on. Superb work from him and a lovely ball in for Shelvey to attack (and draw an OG from). The two of them seem to have a great connection. The English Iniesta and Xavi. 

Lee Probert though. What the fuck, man. Did he have West Ham on his accumulator or something? Some absolutely ridiculous decisions from that clown. I'm not having that as a penalty, the guy blasted the ball into Allen's arm from like a yard away. I think Taylor should have seen a red card for his high boot, studs in challenge (and what looked like a little stamp afterwards) on Sterling. 

And the amount of fouls on Liverpool players that went unpunished by him. Could have had a couple of penalties ourselves I think. Once for bringing Shelvey down and one for earlier with someone climbing all over Agger. Ah well, doesn't matter now. 3 lovely points taken back from West Ham in the last 15 minutes.

Clearly it lacked a huge amount of investment as well as quite a few buildings slap bang in the town centre were close to derelict.

Rents were cheap and so were house prices, at least compared to Wiltshire.  But the roads were windy, there wasn't much of anything to do outside of Kings Lynn and the whole area seemed to have a bit of a forlorn air.

- The note that Finna. There was too much detail. A simply ""found him"" would have sufficed. A way to have Morgana find out: Morgana walks in while he has the note in his hand. The puts two and two together and says that it must be Finna. When Alator looks surprised, Morgana explains that she's been keeping an eye on him.

- Merlin and the knights camp at night in an area with Saxons and a sorcerer (they seemed to quickly forget about the second one). For some reason, Merlin seems to assume that nobody would keep watch.

- Morgana is once again a completely useless villain. Killing Alator was rather dumb when not only does it still give her an option if something happened to Finna, but she could torture Finna in front of Alator.

- Merlin looked extremely weak in this episode. One measly arrow and neither him nor Finna could do a thing about it?

- The box. I expected it to be a MaGuffin that would be useful in the finale. Instead, it was just a repeat of what we already knew, making the whole episode pointless.

- Morgana waging war. What the hell has she been doing the last few seasons?

Overall, it just seemed pointless and full of problems. If they used this for Morgana to actually find out who Merlin was, it could have been great. If they make it so she only realises moments before her death, that would be awful. Even worse if they have old Merlin kill her and she never knows.

If they weren't going to advance the plot, then a ""calm before the storm"" episode would have been much better. A fairly calm (but still interesting) plot with a sombre reminder of what was to come right at the end. Deep Space Nine did episodes like this just before the finale of various seasons extremely well.

To be honest, I've mainly been watching this season because I feel obliged to finish the show.

Out bench is pretty weak, there's not a lot AVB can do to make a significant change unless someone does something out of the ordinary.

true,Learnincurve,derbyshire,Peak District,"A bridge camera has the same sized sensor as a compact camera which means it needs a lot of light to be noise free. You also can't get the background out of focus at all (no depth of field) and anything larger than web size looks mushy - take a picture of a tree, at full size with a m4/3 or DSLR with a decent lens on you will be able to see individual leaves, with a bridge they will be blurred into one another. 

The main problem with bridge cameras is that they are a false investment as you outgrow them very very quickly. They do have manual modes but they are so limited and pointless that keeping them in auto is much less annoying.  

I don't generally recommend cameras I haven't used (I've used most of them from the last 5 years admittedly) and I have the Gf3 as a backup camera with the sigma 30mm f/2.8 and it's sharp as a tack. My 8 year old daughter took [this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/learnin_curve/6803942068/in/set-72157629140076604) with the kit lens on. I'm not a pro but here is  a [cat picture](http://www.flickr.com/photos/learnin_curve/6989960126/) and [portrait](http://www.flickr.com/photos/learnin_curve/7139156057/in/set-72157629933940621) with the sigma 30mm on it. I bought my mother the G3 for her 60th birthday.  All the m4/3 cameras share a mount so you can use your Olympus lenses on a Panasonic camera, although the big difference between the two is that Olympus have in body stabilisation where as Panasonic have it in the lens (which can be switched off).


If anyone is interested my current daily cameras are the Olympus OMD-EM-5 (usually paired with the panasonic leica dg summilux 25mm 1.4) and the fujifilm x100. The latter being expensive but *incredibly* good value for money if you are serious about photography, although it's not even remotely newbie friendly if you don't come from a manual film background.

Johnson's goal - piece of individual brilliance, great for him, great for us.  But this doesn't happen often, lots of  luck involved and it wasn't really a result of our system - an anomaly if you will.  

Cole's goal - granted I didn't see the build up, good positioning, good runs, good pass, good finish.  More of this please (maybe with different players involved).    

Henderson's cross into an OG - again, luck.  Aside from Shelvey, we had 0 people in the box.  

So yea, I'm skeptical of our goal scoring abilities without Suarez seeing how 2/3 of our goals were very lucky.  


In other news, I think our defense is looking a lot better, especially with Lucas back.  The OG was just unlucky.  And we can't really do anything against the pen call.

Lazar Markovic signs for Chelsea!

The dice has been thrown, Lazar Markovic will in the following days sign a contract with Chelsea! He will fulfill his dreams because after Partizan he will wear the shirt of the team in his heart. But that doesn't mean he won't be playing in a Partizan shirt this spring because the London club want to sign him until about the end of the season. His thoughts are staying in (Partizan) or leaving for Holland because Twente, PSV and Vitesse have taken interest in that kind of cooperation. And that dilemma will be solved in the next couple of days.


Strictly kept professional secret that one of the most talented players of Europe has reached out to Chelsea, (has been played out at every level last year) but the confirmation will soon come that this will be one of the biggest transfers from Serbia because it can exceed the sum of 10 million euros. With the fact that he has been playing in the Europa league with the ""eagle"" shirt, it is expected that he will continue to grow in Europe. 


Chelsea is a very young team, Oscar and Hazard are only two years older than Lazar who will according to plans join them in the summer when the second phase of team reconstruction ends. The departures of Lampard, Terry, Cole and Malouda are being announced and meanwhile, next to Markovic, Piazon and Lukaku will be getting playing time.


The managers of the talented Cacanin (Person from Cacak in Serbia) Fali Ramadani and Nikola Damjanac, as well as the heads of the black and whites (Partizan) talked about Markovic staying in Partizan at least for two seasons. Meanwhile, some change in Partizan and the London club sped up the plan for Lazar to join Branislav Ivanovic in the London giant this winter or max in the summer.


SERBIAN INVASION OF THE ISLAND

ENGLAND is becoming the land of promise for Serbians, because it is very possible that alongside Ivanovic, Kolarov, Nastasic and Zigic, from January or the next summer will be playing Lazar MArkovic, Miralem Sulejmani (wanted by West Ham), Zdravko Kuzmanovic (wanted by Arsenal)...


THE BOSS SPEAKS AT LAST

Black and white boss Vladimir Vermezovic has decided to appear in front of the press and will on Monday draw the line (in the fall Serbian champions). In that way, Vermezovic is waited to put a dot on the talks surrounding his status at the club.


OK so this seems very sketchy to me. I lived in Serbia for the first five years of my life and I read Serbian press daily. I have however never heard of this paper ""Vecernje Novosti"" meaning Evening News. This seems very The Sun-like to me because the language is unprofessional, it's very contradictory, repetitive and unreliable. There are no quotes and at this point only rumours and speculations.


I have only heard good things about Lazar and every Partizan game I've seen he is the one that sticks out on the pitch. I do hope we get him and that he does well in the Premier League.

Europe: 10 (6 unique) - Shelvey (4), Downing (2), Suarez (2), Gerrard (1), Johnson (1), Borini (1), Coates (1), Wisdom (1), Cole (1), Henderson (1). 

If we want to be cheeky, we can include the many other goalscorers who have added to our cause - Bale, Baines, Barnett, Collins, Ojala, and Webster.

As if we were meant to let France or the Vatican or whoever just waltz on to the British Isles and take over and rip up Magna Carta etc. I abhor the atrocities that took place, but if you bother to consider the mind set of the time you can understand why foreign Catholic powers were seen as an existential threat to the English way of life and why there was the same sort of fear around Politicised Catholicism then as there was around Communism in the 50s.

That said, he does not look too sharp at the moment, and what we've seen of Daws recently has been better. I think the real problem that we have with our defense at the moment is decision-making, and that's why I agree we need Michael.

Caulker is inexperienced and will make mistakes, Super Jan is new and out of position and will make mistakes, Walker's weak point is his decision-making even when he's on top form, and Gallas has shown that he's not as sharp mentally as he used to be. This collectively poor defensive decision-making is what leads to all these crap clearances and intercepted passes.

Michael Dawson, for his faults (namely - he lacks pace and is poorer with the ball at his feet), is not so prone to making poor decisions. He's been with the club a long time, and he is composed and rarely cocks up, even if he isn't as fundamentally good. So - yes I think he should be starting at the moment.

Note, though, that Villas-Boas played the only CBs he could have today - Dawson is injured.

true,Talyna,cnty-england,Fenland,"I have been living in Benwick for just over a year now (moved from Oxfordshire), which is a village right in between March and Peterborough.

It's nowhere near as affluent an area as Oxfordshire, but it's certainly less crowded. My impression of March, Whittlesey and Fenland in general is that it certainly has seen better days and is fairly run down, but there are some nicer areas. 

I much agree with what others have said about Wisbech, it's not somewhere I like at all, there's something about the atmosphere that just isn't right there, but while March isn't all that special, really isn't all that bad (the town centre at least), it's got a few great local shops and cafes and I have never run into any trouble there. There certainly are rough looking areas but there's also some alright parts.

Where I live in Benwick is really nice and friendly. Theres no more here than a local pub and a primary school. There's a good sense of community in the village with various events going on and all of our neighbours are really nice etc, and again while it isn't the most affluent of places (comparing to Oxfordshire) it does feel like an effort is being made to make it as nice as possible. A little while ago there was even a PCSO coming to all the houses to ask if we has any issues or concerns! and I think it's much the same for the next village along Wimblington/Doddington (quite a bit bigger with a few local shops) where some of my relatives live.

If you were going to live this side of Peterborough I would probably recommend one of the villages nearby, but you do need to be prepared to drive everywhere to do things (that has been tough for me coming from a town with a train station/good town centre 10 mins walk away). The closest town that I would probably recommend looking at is Ely, it's a bit further away and probably more expensive (and only gets more so as you approach Cambridge, but it certainly is a nicer looking area.

tldr; there isn't too much going for the area, and I would imagine it gets better in all directions as you move out of the fens, but there's certainly some nice bits and it's not all that bad.

 I think with this current trending of globalisation and the very tiny movements of centralisation of the European union into a continental state the border in Ireland seems really pointless and then on a regional scale, Britain and Ireland will be grouped together  as  the Isles region of the E.U of course this is just  a crack pot theory.

After that, you do whatever you want, really. I came to University. If by research papers, you mean essays, that depends entirely on what subject you do.

true,Nemokles,null,null,"I think songs should be personalized. Something to do with his background, commitment to the club, skill or events from the pitch.

What made the Torres song great, as well as being sung to a good tune, is that every line tells the story of the player and *why we ~~love~~ loved him*.

&gt;His armband proved he was a red - Torres, Torres  
You'll never walk alone it said - Torres, Torres  
We bought the lad from sunny Spain  
He gets the ball he scores again  
Fer-nan-do Torres, Liverpool's number nine. 

From this we get the story of the spanish player Torres who, according to his armband, might've been a fan of the club even before he arrived. He scored a lot of goals and played in the number nine shirt.

Johnson's song should follow a simmilar pattern, I think. So, a few facts to keep in mind if someone wants to write a song about him:

- Born in London, brought up in the West Ham academy (we don't have a major rivalry with the Hammers, but I'm not sure if people would accept a song with a reference to another club in it).

- Is a very versatile player, both in where he can play and in terms of his skillset. He can tackle, dribble, pass, cross, shoot, has pace, a certain physical strengt, work ethic. He's not our best player at any of these, but he does them all well in my opinion.

- Predominantly a right back, right legged and plays in shirt number 2.

- He appears to be quite loyal to the club and he's played more league matches for us than for any other club. I remember seeing a quote by him stating the sentiment that he was a lot more keen on playing abroad before coming to Liverpool, that he likes playing for the club.

- He's an international player for England.

- Studies for maths degree on his down time, he's also learned Spanish that way. 

- He has two tattoos, one saying ""tell me I can’t and I will show you I can"" (a message to teachers who didn't believe in him, he's a little embarrassed about the tone of it now) and the other ""everything happens for a reason.""

Paul Paker said this about Johnson after we signed him in June 2009:

&gt; Glen Johnson is not only the best right back for England – he's also the best in the league. In fact, I'd go so far as to say he could be the best in the world. I really think that. Some people rave about Ashley Cole being one of the best in the world but Johnson on the other side has all the attributes to be even better than him. People also go on about European and South American full backs, but Glen beats them all for me. As a former right-back, I watch him and I can tell you he is one of the very, very best there is and the lad can only keep on improving.

""The best [right back] in the league"" and ""Glen beats them all for me"" are quotes I think might fit nicely into a song.

[Here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/9731786/Liverpool-defender-Glen-Johnson-reveals-he-is-studying-for-maths-degree-in-his-downtime-from-playing.html)'s a recent interview with him that tells part of hist story and has a few quotes from him.

If anything, I see what they're doing this season with Gaius and Merlin as a way of making Merlin feel more and more alone and desperate.  He no longer heeds Gaius's advice, believing he is powerful enough to handle what come, and in a way, he no longer trusts Gaius.  Merlin's behavior is becoming more and more self destructive.  In this episode alone, he went to speak with a women he didn't know, ignoring, for no good reason, all the warnings that she may be trying to kill him, and then when he was found with her, instead of lying the way he normally would, he attacks Percy with magic.  If anyone other than Mordred had seen him, they would have known that he had magic and it would have been all over.

And the scene with Finna [spoiler](/s ""knowingly going to her death to save Merlin"") was still sad.

And the message in the box - will Merlin finally accept that he can't stop Arthur's death at Camlann?

The preview seems to set up [spoiler](/s ""Mordred's betrayal"") kinda stupidly... Really? [spoiler](/s ""Mordred's going to betray Arthur because of some chick we haven't seen before?"") Then again, I'm not really surprised if that's the case; the writing on this show is not great.

Anyway... Yeah. Not a good episode.

Had we had the ability to start with BAE/Kaboul, then we could've made a switch at the back during the second half. If we had Parker, he could've made a good stint and help keep it tight at the back. 

We are really pushing our squad right now, and we need to get more width, by injured players coming back soon, and getting anther CM that can actually play the ball and help us keep on the offense. 

As soon as we switch out Dembele, our game ceases to exist and we're left to defend for the remainder of the game.

Suarez's shots come from difficult dribbles and bad passes from the wings. In the game against Udinese, Sterling fucked up 2 golden opportunities for Suarez to finish. This means Suarez has to run even harder to catch up to the ball, and by the time he gets there the defenders are already covering him or the GK has positioned himself perfectly. Remember that goal against Newcastle? That was what Suarez is capable of with the perfect pass/cross.

Also, Suarez is the only striker around. He's the one who has to make all the shots, because he's the only one chosen to do so. The shot count of the team pales in comparison to Suarez's, he averages 4 shots per ""other"" shot. He's the only one in the box too, who's he going to pass it to? Passing it back would be a waste and a risk because of all the hard work it took him to at least get a kick in.

I saw this film perhaps ten years ago, I was at home watching TV with my Dad late at night, and it was one of those things that was on at 2am on channel 4, you know, artsy stuff hidden away in the schedule. We had been watching a long game of snooker or something, and so ended up flicking through those 2am programs and happened to find Elephant.

I had never heard of it before, no knowledge of it. I remember watching the first scene, the killing, and thinking ""ok, cool, an action film, maybe a crime film, a gangster film, lets see where it goes""... and then there was another killing, and another, no dialogue yet, and me and my dad started to look at each other all confused through the silence, ""what the fuck is this?""

And as it continued I found myself thinking ""This is stupid, what is this? Why do they just keep killing people? There's no plot, no motivation, just a bunch of men killing each other for no reason in shitty parts of industrial estates."" and I kept watching, and then it ended, and I was left sitting there in silence with my dad, thinking ""what the hell did we just watch?""

It struck me, and sunk in, and had *exactly* the desired effect. I mean it was fucking *masterful* film making. Now, when I think of the Troubles, I don't think of politics, I don't think of arguments for or against, I don't think of boarders or nations or kingdoms, I just think of a bunch of middle aged lower class guys killing one another in this sort of vacuum of logic and reason.

It changed the way I looked at that conflict, at the most fundamental level, it really did. Even other conflicts - how great would it be to see someone make a piece of art this powerful about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan - to make you forget the politics and the terrorism and the us-vs-them and just to see a bunch of people having their houses burned down and their families bombed or soldiers being blown up by IEDs. 

I think it's because of this film that now where I see wars and conflicts and violence discussed in political terms, I will still tend to view things from a human level - as the General stands on the news talking about percentage death tolls and collateral damage, I just see those twenty second static shots of normal people laying there in pools of their own blood.

All I am saying is that this film hit me with as much force as it is possible for a film to muster, and I know I am not the only one.

A masterpiece.

It's a drug that takes over someone's life and will eventually financially cripple the user. Good, hard working people with families and mortgages have lost it all and become withered, homeless criminals as a result of its use.
The cost of it, combined with its effects and addictive properties make it the sort of drug that makes it very hard to sustain a job or lifestyle, other than looking for the next fix. The only way decriminalising it would work logistically is by giving it away on the NHS to anyone to said ""I fancy taking up heroin today"", which is beyond absurd.

It is also linked to acquisitive crime, so there are huge knock on effects. Many addicts will take massive risks stealing copper cable that runs high voltages, just for a few pennies.

But we do know that there is one downside to democracy, the rules set by the majority can be oppressive to a minority; also, the popular opinion of the majority can be totally wrong, not necessarily because voters are stupid, just because you can't expect every voter to be well versed in some very technical things.

So what if we had 2 parts? We have the publicly elected MPs: career politicians well versed in keeping people happy and diplomacy. They are directly answerable to the people through elections and hold most of the power. They draw up and pass the laws and make decisions on domestic and foreign policy. They have ministers running the various functions of the government, just like now.

Then we have the ""house of experts"" we'll call it. These are not the lords. They are **not** appointed by the ruling party and they do **not** hold their seat for life, definitely don't pass it on to their children, that's just really stupid. In this way, they can't be directly controlled or aligned to any particular political party. Instead, they are nominated by leaders in their fields and elected by well known councils of their field. Somewhat like how the royal society picks their fellows. These people work most of their lives in their chosen profession. They are recognised for their achievements to their field and to society and have proven their dedication through a lifetime of work (though some are still quite young, like Brian Cox).

They are responsible for reviewing and making recommendations on laws and policies that make it through Parliament. They can pass them or reject them with amendments. The reasons for rejection are made public to allow us voters to see why the experts would disagree with the politicians and therefore educate the voters for the better. They can stop politically motivated or populist policies which are technically infeasible or just plain wrong from sneakily making their way through Parliament while the voters are sleeping. Policies like the snooper bill currently trying to sneak through.

I agree with you in that religious leaders should be included since they are experts in a certain field too. But not in the numbers they are now, and they need to have religious leaders outside the CoE. Islam, Catholicism, Sikh, Buddhism etc. But kept minimal. Just one of each perhaps.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"For me, the argument against GM is really flaky because we have been engineering food for our benefit for years without having a clue; only now with the ability to have some understanding of the genome can we really engineer and have some idea about what it will do. There are numerous ethical problems though, but nothing we aren't capable of dealing with; I just fear greed will dictate these issues.

There is no great campaign, like there is with animals, for the preservation of species that we've made extinct. 200 years ago there were thousands of varieties of wheat and apples now there are hundreds - this is not caused by building cities and destroying natural orchids; its caused by the man made intervention into the breeding of plants. We have reduced our diversity (evolutions biggest tool) and, at the same time, changed the environmental make-up of the earth. There is no way to go back to diversity (save hundreds of millions of years of zero intervention), arable land area is decreasing due to global warming - GM is a viable and useful method where we can design plants adapted to environments in order to maximise our food supply. There is also significant potential that plants could be used for drug production.

What we need is really tight regulation on seeds that get sold - no terminator seeds forcing one company (Monsanto) to own the supply. Absolutely no patents for modified seeds (though there needs to be a modern way of funding the research) and if there are patents they cannot force farmers into licencing seeds controlling the supply chain of food. Here is an example of what I think could go wrong:

Corporation X modifies a plant genome to make it grow faster, have a larger yield, be resistant to forms of abiotic stress that its ""natural"" ancestor wasn't. A farmer, convinced by the marketing buys this seed. He has an excellent yield and next year goes back to buy the seeds because he doesn't cultivate his own crop; this is far too time consuming and saves relatively little money, anyway he couldn't because the seeds contain self termination genes so you have to buy them next year.

Corporation X realising they have the product that now supplies most of the worlds wheat raises the prices. Because of patent legislation they sue anyone that uses ""their"" make-up of wheat, alternatives exist but they don't get the yields required to make a liveable profit. The patent here does not allow innovation, it simply maintains a monopoly. We cannot and must not allow anyone to have a monopoly on world food supplies; this will probably happen as governments insist on using ancient laws in situations that really don't work (look how they try and apply copyright legislation on the Internet, look at how software patents destroy this market). 

Essentially what I'm saying is that the Science, technology and legislature needs to be based on an Open Source model. No-one should be allowed to ""own"" a genome or a single gene. If that makes it harder to make billions in profit, so be it - more competition means more innovation in the production of seeds, the wholesale process the actual farming.",0,1355140207,null,0,false,0,c7e6yhq,t3_14lija,t1_c7e6yhq,t3_14lija,null,1430631799,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

Besides your strange comment, I agree with you.

Also, remove the dark side of drugs, e.g. the black market and dealing with harden criminals and you'll remove most drug related and petty crime very quickly.

You'd be able to build an aircraft that doesn't need to cater to the fragility of us humans. No g-force would be too high in a maneuver. 

They'd also likely be half the size so you could pack more of them onto an aircraft carrier, or better yet have smaller faster aircraft carriers. 

All this stuff they're contracting out seems archaic in comparison to what's actually possible in 2012.

We've moved a few thousand sheep off the high hills around Loch Lomond - normally you gather the sheep in off the high hills over the course of a couple of days, and park them in some lower, smaller, fields, before bringing them down to the farm... (Or if it's a big enough flock, there's usually some sort of fank on the hill so they can be separated out in to age groups for going to market etc.) You could make off with a load if you could acquire them on the hill, before we managed to bring them down for the winter.

From the home farm to where the sheep were, would be half a day by landrover and on foot... so fairly remote - and cattle floats are not an uncommon sight depending on the time of year...

The farmer also had sheep on other land - like the Garrison farm at Inversnaid - a good few miles up the road... If the sheep were in the low fields, you could drive a cattle float up and herd them on with a couple of dogs...

Definitely agree on forbidding any other form of income and severely limit what expenses can be paid out.

Build a block of flats near the Houses of Parliament, and give all MPs accommodation there. No second homes to be paid out for, if MPs want to keep their family and such in their home in their constituency, then they pay for that out of their wages. Accommodation in the flat block and travel to and fro are expenses paid.

Now, to contrast you, I'd say either continue to pay £60k, or **reduce** the wages of MPs, but still keep them competitive enough to make the hassle of running a county worth it.

I understand the ""higher wages = more experienced candidates going into politics over business"", but clearly that doesn't work at the minute. It seems most MPs are there for the money (which is severely cut off from the expenses and income blockade as mentioned before).

This will effectively cause any career politicians hoping to ride out a super cushy annual income and retirement pension whilst doing very little to decide to head for the private sector instead, and really limit the MP candidate pool to those who are actually passionate and dedicated about politics and making a difference, where the £60k or so is okay, because they're able to take part in the running of the country.",0,1355145091,null,0,false,0,c7e7iy3,t3_14ksp0,t1_c7e7iy3,t1_c7e78ku,null,1430632076,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You're thousands of miles away in a nice little part of presumably the US, who has the luxury of seeing the game and now wringing your hands about how ashamed you are of people on the other side of the world who you have never met but are so happy to judge.

Let me explain this so you people might be able to understand this a little clearer.

To you, this game goes away next week.  There will be a new thing to worry about.  For us in Manchester, this game will last for six months.  In work, in pubs, at parties, around the city. 

It was an incredibly passionate and tense game with huge importance placed on it by all sets of fans, who have been winding each other up for months before and after about it, with knock on effects for players, managers, title races, etc. In addition to this, both fans had been giving it out to each other the entire game and City fans felt annoyed that Ferdinand celebrated RVPs goal directly in front of them in the last minute of the game.  At that moment, a couple of people out of the 47000 people there were annoyed and felt disrespected enough that Ferdinand, a man who is extremely dislike by City fans ran towards them and taunted them whilst behind an entire fleet of stewards so made a split second decision to throw a coin at him in retaliation.

Now, I don't condone this in any way and think that they should be banend and will cooperate with City wherever possible to ensure that they are, but the idea that you're ""embarrassed"" by them is embarrassing to me.

When you go to a City versus United game that's extremely tense and sit next to the away fans who are constantly throwing things backwards and forwards, threatening murder and all sorts of stuff, then watch your team go down to 2-0, then watch them come back to 2-2, then watch them lose 3-2 in the last minute, then have one of their most despised players rub it in by celebrating in front of you, and you sit there happily appluading then you can judge those fans.

Until that day when you are actually in the position of those people, how about you sit there handwringing in front of your big screen TV and your knock off City shirt and leave the business of supporting the Club to those who understand the idea of what it is like to be a part of football atmosphere in front of a rival crowd and can picture their own anger and frustration in that split second?

""Fans"" like you really piss me off, willing to throw your own fans under the fucking bus to make yourself feel better despite not even attempting to understand them or their motivation.

&gt;will eventually financially cripple the user

&gt;homeless criminals as a result of its use

&gt;Many addicts will take massive risks stealing copper cable that runs high voltages, just for a few pennies.

The reason that it is so expensive is because it is on the black market, and is so heavily punished by current UK law. By using you become a criminal, and an addict. The problems with crime stem from this fact, and in my opinion this is a direct reason that it should be decriminalised. If heroin was taken off the black market you would starve organised crime of a huge source of income, you would remove the need for addicts to commit crime in order to fund their habit, and most importantly in my opinion, you turn them from 'criminal scum' (as I hear users described so often) into patients. I cannot stress the personal psychological importance of this last point enough. 

&gt;The only way decriminalising it would work logistically is by giving it away on the NHS to anyone to said ""I fancy taking up heroin today"", which is beyond absurd.

How many people do you think would, one day, suddenly decide to shoot up heroin in an NHS drugs clinic? The people who would go to these clinics would be existant users. They would be provided with a clean, safe environment, the drugs would be safe and administered properly, and it would allow the government to better assess the problem rather than randomly guessing, which is nearly impossible due to the illegality of the drug in the first place.

2.  Whole genome sequence data will be completely anonymised  anonymised  apart from when it is used for an individuals own care.

Otherwise the role of women in politics will be more limited than it already is, and I would suggest that is not a good thing. 

You suggest the pay of MPs should be competitive to make the hassle of running the country worth it, but that kind of measure is subjective and always prone to comparison with the public sector. Is £60k a lot of money? It's more than average for the nation, but not enormous for a family in London with a single earner. Any bright young spark who would be a valuable decision maker and leader for the country could easily earn more than £60k with less hassle and media intrusion than even the slackest of MPs faces. Don't get me wrong, I'm not an apologist for MPs, but I do think it's a tough job and I'd like to see better people doing it than we see now. 

Again the argument that most MPs are there for the money also seems to me to be a good argument for increasing basic pay and reducing other forms of income to prevent exactly the problem you describe. I want my MP to be proud of working very hard for very good money on my behalf and my behalf only, not also for the benefit of any given donor or benefactor who happens to be able to pour money into whatever agenda they may have. 

Regulating allowances properly and removing other sources of income means no one can game the system and everyone is on an equal footing.

It's a bit like randomly throwing a punch in a crowd. 99% of the time you're likely to do nothing worse than piss someone off and start a fight, but there's always the small sliver of a chance you hit someone with a glass jaw and you end up killing them.

Where did they get these figures from? This is what i hate about the BBC, they rarely provide sources for their statistics. Did they just walk about on the street and ask random people if they take drugs or not? 

Also, they need to stop putting all ""drugs"" in the same category. They talk about decriminalising all drugs, but don't consider approving some and rejecting others. For example, when a non-drug user hears ""drugs"" on the news, they instantly think ""heroin"", ""cocaine"", ""meth"", when really, most of the drug related ""crimes"" they hear about are cannabis related. A drug that couldn't hurt a fly. Maybe if there were two categories; Harmful drugs and Non-Harmful drugs, this situation would be a lot simpler.

true,TimothyThomas,lfc68,,"Well, here goes it. I've been a LFC fan for years now, ever since I lived in London and had a boy-crush for young Michael Owen. Now, the man has long since lost my heart-throbbing love, but it seems that he has been replaced enough by now (far enough removed) that I don't even need to work him in when I think about my support for LFC. All in all, now, it's about the games for me. I watch a ton of football. I watch every LFC game I don't miss due to work, and watch a full match download usually if I can (and have missed it). I watch every Barca game (because, barca), and sincerely feel that if anyone loves the sport of football, this is the team to watch because one day people will remember and know that this was one of the best teams to watch during one of the best and most competitive eras of football (people will say differently about the spanish league, but I stick to my guns). I watch Dortmund, Fenerbahce (because, kuyt), PSV (occasionally), and I am an avid DC united fan, being a DC local. 

But all this is beside the point. I am not hoping for a jersey for myself, I am trying to give a great birthday/holiday gift to my good friend, who is also a huge liverpool, barca, and DC united fan (she went to the first game in 1996 and we both attended the most recent 1-1 Draw against houston which knocked DC out of the playoffs. I know I can speak for her when I say that between michael owen and then, later, fernando torres, she has had her fair share of disappointment with our strikers and there eventual snubbing of LFC. Both were her favorite players on our team, and both have gone on to ""better things"" or so they say. Maybe, though, just maybe, fernando won't be one to talk about us in 10 years as if we destroyed his career and gave him unending injury issues and he should've just 'gone to man united in the first place' (thanks for that, mikey). All I can hope for is that this guy torres is still a gentlemen like we all knew him to be, and I sincerely believe that we won't have to see him in a bad light a few years from now (or twenty years from now) and can remember fondly our years with a spanish coach, a spanish striker, and a damn beautiful spanish midfielder and not dismiss the first two for hanging out with that rich harlot chelsea, where every famous player/hot new coach gets a ride for at least half a year. 

In summation, I think my friend would cherish a gift such as this, and I'm hoping that somehow, through my incoherent ramblings, you've gotten the message that both myself and my friend are huge LFC fans and will never stop being so. But also, we're both level-headed and just love this fucking sport (and esp. the new style liverpool are playing, because I love the possession based game - it's really the art of the sport, in my opinion). 

If you are interested at all, my friend is also a great visual artist (scanning, drawing, screenprinting, photography) and this is a link to some of her work. Just click on any of the thumbnails. This should qualify, in my opinion, as something creative and something amazing that she made. 

http://resistortransistor.com/?q=node/124

I hope you consider me and if you'd like to know anything else, let me know. Also, it's fair to say that I'd love this jersey, but I'd rather sell my friend as the huge fan because, honestly, she is more likely to be in joy or be crushed by a big game's result, and she would cherish this more than most people.",0,1355151580,null,0,false,0,c7e8l7b,t3_14lqdm,t1_c7e8l7b,t3_14lqdm,null,1430632573,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Over use causes long term and extreme damage to your liver and you can easily take too much to flat out kill you. The come down (ie a hang over) is painful and debilitating if relatively short. It is very easy to become mentally depended on it and you *can* become physical depended on it as well which is not actually the case for cannabis or even something like MDMA. 

There is utterly no logical or moral reason that alcohol is a legal drug and something like cannabis is not. Not a single one. If you want to keep cannabis illegal because of the harm you think it does then your moral imperative really should be to campaign to make alcohol illegal first because if if cannabis was made legal and alcohol was banned you still be coming out ahead in what you see as the prevention of harm. 

Simply put this is called evidence based policy making, we need more of it.

~~Thirdly, the current proposal if passed *still* wouldn't create equality before the law for heterosexual and homosexual couples because homosexual couples would still be legally forbidden from having religious marriage services, when even the religious group themselves want to do it, as is the case with Quakers and if I recall correctly Reform Jewish groups and a few others as well.~~ This is apparently no longer accurate.

I want one because I would have approx 1% chance of ever getting a signed liverpool shirt, because out of my friends im the only one who loves football its impossible to go to a match and enjoy it with friends, along with personal reasons (funds) I loved watching Torres and was sad seeing home go, something physical to keep that memory would be lovely.

My best memory this year has to be this ""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0o__dpEiKg""

I would make something if i was in any way artistic/capable.

During the Champions League Final against Milan, i was pretty pissed off at half time, went outside to cool down, at the time I had about 3 footballs in the garden, in frustration i belted the first one, smashed the garage windows, and with the send sent it 40ft up my neighbours tree's, not funny at the time but great memory.

Anyway, really been enjoying this subreddit, Im a reddit user for over a year but only a few months ago realised ""hey there must be a lfc reddit"" 

This is likely my first post on the sub-reddit, but be sure im a constant lurker.

Great giveaway goodluck to everyone :).

true,polostring,null,null,"**The reason I want one:**

I love Torres.  I still do.  I don't care that he moved on to Chelsea.  I still have so many fond memories of him burying goals for LFC.  Great memories, like him linking up with Gerrard for this [wonder goal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ebe52xNP4Kw).  He was a great player for Liverpool and helped this club tremendously.  Although I wish he had stayed I don't feel bitter about his departure.  

My position is that footballers have very limited and fickle careers.  At practically any moment they can get injured and then, bam, it is done.  Torres was here during a tumultuous nightmare situation concerning upper management and owners.  Hicks and Gillett were running this club into the ground.  A manager that he had done well under (Benitez) had been shoved out the door.  He had also seen good talent whisked away under bad circumstances (Masch and Alonso), and the club was struggling.  To top it all off Torres had problems with injuries and he was getting older.  He wanted a chance to immediately win things and wanted to do well to keep his place in a highly competitive national squad.  I really don't have ill will towards him and hope he does well now that he is back with Benitez. (Well enough to finish below LFC that is)

I still have my Spain Torres kit that I will wear proudly. (can upload a pic when I am home)

The reason I really want one of these shirts is because...I have tried before and failed to get exactly this!  I live in New England (USA) and have never had a chance to get to Anfield.  I honestly don't think I will have many chance to see LFC players live in person.  Because of this, when Spain came here to Foxboro to play the USA, I jumped at a chance to see some LFC fans live in action.  I drove down to Providence to head out to the hotel where the Spain squad was staying.  (a schedule was posted so people would know when the players would be headed to the hotel)  I patiently waited for a few hours in a decent crowd to watch the bus pull in...and see the players hurried into the hotel by the staff and avoid all the fans.  Reina, Alonso, and Torres--rushed inside and not allowed to interact with anyone.  I tried to at least get some grainy cell phone pics, but alas, nothing came out well.  (Side note: Pique tried to head out to the fans.  He was waving and smiling and ready to sign autographs and meet people, but someone rushed over and hurried him inside.)

**Best memory this year:**
I couldn't decide so I will pick a short top 3

* Pre-season friendly against Roma:  LFC come to Boston and I get to watch them play live for my first and only time.  (I was seated low and near the tunnel.  Carragher and Cole came out mid game and were very friendly with the fans as they headed to the bench.  Classy lot.)
* 2-2 at home against Man City.  LFC might be rebuilding, but they can still play with the ""big boys""
* 2-3 Win away at West Ham.  Rebuilding young team.  Without their top striker.  Going down, away, with 15 minutes remaining and then turning the match around.  This match was a thriller and it has been quite some time since I screamed at a TV so much.

**Something Creative**

As part of my job I teach part time at a local public school.  I am supposed to stick to the basics.  You know science and math, forces and division.  But I like to slip as much football in there as possible.  I wear LFC gear to teach and educate the youngin's about soccer whenever I get the chance.

Referring to the QIPP  scheme Better Care Better Value Indicators: Managing Surgical Thresholds (http://www.productivity.nhs.uk/Dashboard/For/National/And/25th/Percentile) there has been a drive within the NHS to look at some interventions where the delivery of treatment provides little to no benefit to the patient. 
From these treatments it is understood that if numbers of treatments are reduced only to the point where it is clinically advised then a cost saving can be made. 
As a means to encourage PCTs to drive the work, the NHS III drew up quarterly ""league tables"" for the five surgical interventions. 

Further to BCBV:MST some PCTs have used the work to drive local forms of the work (one programme of regional/local work was PLCV), but have increased the range of interventions. This was done following advice from clinical professionals (from primary, secondary care and PH settings). It is likely this is local work that the blog tries to get at, however the manner in which the blog does so - is quite heavy handed. 

Additional points to GP bookings (off topic from alshaw's post).
GPs are private contractors to the NHS for the provision of primary care. Issues related to booking are made by GP management and not the NHS. I just want to clarify this; if people are experiencing difficulty at their surgeries regarding booking, please provide them with feedback. Its much better for a surgery to receive 20 feedback comments on booking experience than the odd one here and there.

It doesn't matter if it would be a league cup tie where they would only field our youngsters or if it were against Barcelona and we might get smashed. I just want to be a part of that atmosphere, to sing the songs, cringe at goals scored against us and to cheer the ones we score. 

My favorite moment this year would definitely have to be the Gerrard goal vs United. At the time (before they went up) it seemed like poetic justice. Gerrard, our great talisman scoring against our biggest rivals. It almost seemed like destiny. But then it wasn't. Anyways, still my favorite moment.

There's no such thing as British genetics.

The native Brit (if there is such a thing) is a mongrel breed, containing elements of Angle, Saxon, Celtic, Viking, French and serveral other groups. There has also been massive inflow from the old colonies and other foreign interaction since the Romans. The makeup of ancestory of each individual is hugely variable and there is are no uniquely British markers. This means there is no way to type an indvidual as genetically British.

Subsequently British just exists as a cultural grouping. You either imigrate and become part of the culture, or you don't. You emigrate and you either join a lot of other culturally British people and stay British (like in parts of Spain and France), or you become part of a new culture and cease to be British.

The idea that a remake *ruins* the original is such an irrational, self-righteous mentality.  The only thing wrong is that, if the show becomes popular, you'll be irked when people say they like a version that you disapprove of.

The American television industry is enormous and is constantly looking for new ideas.  Most television shows, regardless of inspiration, fail.  A remake is a way to take a proven concept and have an edge, however slight, in trying to find success.

A remake is also necessary because you can't simply rebroadcast the original episodes.

When I was a mascot, I got to keep the full kit. My mother suggested I got it signed by the whole team, but I was too stupid, and ""didn't want to ruin it"". I was 9, I was young, and I didn't understand what I was missing out on. I'm 16, now, but I still feel as if I ruined that incredible day, by not completing it and getting the kit signed. 

What you're doing is incredibly generous, and I'm sure whoever gets it will be thrilled, as will I be. It'd be awesome to get it and I'd finally feel satisfied that the best day of my life was indeed that, and it would be completed. I wouldn't have anymore regrets. 

I've been a die-hard LFC fan, living in London, for 14 years. It would just be awesome to own it. Props to you for doing this though man. 

Also - best memory of this year? Got to be the absolute hammering we gave to Chelsea in May 4-1, with Henderson, Agger &amp; Shelvey scoring. Although Johnson's 87th minute winner against them last November was awesome too. And winning the League Cup and doing the double over Everton was nice too.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;UK Uncut has a pretty simple mission. They think corporate taxes should be higher than they are.

Is that right? I thought they were more about companies actually paying tax rather than evading it.

This is a ridiculous article, I don't think a payment made out of 'goodwill' by Starbucks is what UK  Uncut, or anyone else, want, it's that they actually pay the correct rates and contribute fairly when their competitors have to do the same. £20m appears to be fairly derisory seeing as they've been able to create an uneven playing field.

UK Uncut have smelt blood and are pushing to get a better result.

But this particular shift is entirely of Cameron's own making. 

To be honest the timing of this seems to link incredibly tightly with the church of England's failure to permit women bishops. My guess is that they saw this was a moment when the church had completely sacrificed its ability to say anything on public policy and decided to make an end run. Allowing civil marriage only was always a temporary compromise. This way they get to be the ones that end this particular battle.

It doesn't - because the State designs the tax code in the way that it does knowing full well what the effects are.

Companies are also equally well aware of the real tax rate they pay in countries - as opposed to the headline rate that people focus on.

If you close the exemptions, then all that happens is that the headline rate falls to match the real underlying rate. No more money is raised.

While curbing exemptions cuts costs as terms of tax processing, which is actually a very good thing to do - it also deprives a government of the ability to offer tax-based incentives to boost investment.

For example, how do you offer a firm an incentive to put their factory in a deprived area if tax-emptions on such investments are banned?

You might design an alternative incentive scheme, but that is just a tax-reduction by another name.

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"**Sorry for the long comment, I did ramble a bit**

I can't tell you why Reddit in general supports it, or atleast doesn't support the corporations but I can tell you what I think.

I think the internet's primary function is fast and accurate duplication of data and it's bloody good at it. In fact it is *so* good at it that I would go as far as saying it's the single most important invention in human history. It can educate and inform literally hundreds of millions of people with relative ease and it can do it without misplacing or corrupting a single letter among billions.

The digital world is also 100% malleable. Computers will only ever do precisely what we tell them to and nothing more and, if you are clever enough, you can tell them to do whatever the hell you want. 

Because of these two properties nothing can ever be considered final, controlled or secure. It's simply a percentages game. Your online banking is *secure enough* that the vast majority of attempts to out-compute it will fail in some way. That won't be the case forever, systems we thought were secure just 20 years ago can be bypassed in seconds today by a home PC through sheer number crunching brute force.

This is why, to me, the idea exerting any kind of semblance of control over information you wish the public to have some level of access to (Listen/Watch/Play etc) is mind boggling. It's more futile than trying to push a wet mattress up a spiral staircase. It's **never** going to happen. 

This is where the phrase *""Information wants to be free*"" comes from. The digital world has no possible way of understanding our concept of privacy. It's built to be literally the opposite end of the scale from privacy. 

So what are we to do? We've created this thing where access to precise information is nearly instant and practically free. We have a collection of people who were intelligent enough to turn the *previous* system into an advantage and build massive corporations but can't do the same with the new system. Lastly, we have literally thousands of young entrepreneurs who are building things that will make them a success inside the new system. 

**I** think we should stop giving a flying fuck about people who refuse to change. This is the way the world works now and short of destroying every digital device on the planet we are **never** going back. Information, for all intents and purposes, is now not something we can control. It's over. The horse has bolted. The ship has sank and the fat lady has sang.

Data no longer belongs to anyone in any realistic way, we should now think of data as something you create and then when it's placed in any kind of public sphere you relinquish all control. No amount of lawsuits or moral pleading can change that. It's just the way the digital world works.

There are people out there who are coming up with new ways to create data, give it away and still be successful. We've not progressed this far into our history and suddenly ran out of clever ideas. We just happen to have a bunch of dinosaurs with giant chests full of cash halting progress for their own pathetic greedy needs. They are irrelevant. They have no place in the current status quo and if pirating their movies makes the meteor fly faster then so fucking be it. 

I mean really. Essentially what they are saying is you shouldn't be allowed access to certain information if you didn't get it via their 'approved' methods. If you weren't allowed to read certain books without asking the government for permission first there would be some kind of civil war. I don't particularly see why it's all that different when the 'approved' route happens to mean payment. 

It's not theft. You aren't leaving someone without their thing. What's actually happening is you are removing their potential to make a profit from you. That shouldn't be a crime. Because it's absurd. If I choose not to go on holiday next year am I committing the crime of depriving EasyJet money they *expected* to get from me? 

Arts, especially, should be viewed as speculative investments. Just because you went ahead and spent all your money on instruments to make your album doesn't *give you the right* to get that money back. You took a risk. It didn't pay off. Whether or not I still heard your music doesn't change that. ",0,1355161952,null,0,1355162149,0,c7ebcmr,t3_14lka7,t1_c7ebcmr,t1_c7e9xxd,null,1430633943,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Never spend more than 2 quid on a 2 litre bottle of cider, just shove some black currant squash in there and it's drinkable

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"Most of which are caused by the illegal status of the drug.

The high cost of drugs is caused primarily by the risks the supplier has to take to get them to their customers. The high cost causes addicts to commit other crimes to fund their habit.

Legalising would reduce costs, thus reducing related crimes as well as giving addicts a single target for their crime. Why would you steal someone's TV to buy drugs when you can just steal drugs directly from a shop? Also, legal drugs would open the door for help for addicts that can't afford it. If you don't have the money to buy food people will give you food so you don't steal it. No reason why that couldn't happen with drugs.

Legal drugs could be quality controlled *and* taxed *and* would offer the government more direct and friendly access to addicts. Allowing them to educate, Reducing accidental overdoses, spread of diseases through dirty needles etc. Or what happened here recently. Anthrax in the Heroin supply.

If drugs were legal there would be less of a stigma about being a drug addict. It would still exist but currently it prevents people from seeking the help they need. 

Lastly, in terms of direct physical effects.. Well those would be reduced greatly for the above reasons but also if we are going to legislate that you shouldn't be allowed to do *Activity X* because it's potentially harmful then we should outlaw parachuting, driving, **smoking** and golf too.

Legalising drugs does nothing but good for society, as far as I am concerned.

EDIT: Oh also, I read a thing the other day that said a big part of the reason some drugs today are so powerful is because in a completely unregulated market, like illegal drugs, the suppliers are constantly adapting and coming up with new formulas that'll make people buy their stuff over others. Legal drugs could be tested for safety and graded by strengths if we wanted to.

This coupled with the the Government refusing to look at changing the laws around drugs is the problem in my view.

The widespread media generally portray Drugs as things that'll change you into some murderous psychopath and cause many horrendous problems later in life. Again obviously if you abuse a substance you will have problems, it's the same with anything really but In moderation Drugs can open up new areas of your mind and you won't necessarily turn into some incoherent mess.

true,pegbiter,null,null,"I think the Office US is significantly better than the Office UK. Sure, the first season of the US version was basically just re-doing the exact episodes as the UK version, but from season 2 onwards they took their own characters in their own direction and created something more charming, more amusing, and with more depth than Ricky Gervais could muster. David Brent is something of an obnoxious cunt, while Michael Scott is more of a loveable well-meaning idiot. 

Sure, 8 seasons (or is it 9?) in and Office US is flagging and is probably going to be cancelled soon, but it had a real good run. 

There is a certain stoic pride that British comedy generally only produces very few episodes and very few seasons and remain classics without the long petering death that American programmes often do. In general, I think that pride is quite justified. 

But for the Office UK, I don't think those characters really had any inherent depth to even go anywhere beyond the second season even if they wanted to. The Office US is going to have a cast of memorable characters as its legacy, while the Office UK has only a stupid fucking dance as its legacy. 

That said, I don't think US 'remakes' of UK shows are in general particularly successful, but 'cross-overs' using the best of British *and* American talent can produce gems like [Episodes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episodes_\(TV_series\)). Similarly, Lilyhammer combines American humour with Norwegian culture.

Hmmm, yes.  We see this a lot in these kind of discussions about Directors' fiduciary duties and so on and how they are duty bound to only consider short term interests and to maximise profit.  And that might be true under US law, I've no idea.  But under recent UK statutory provisions in [the Companies Act 2006](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/contents), our law is somewhat different.  The focus has shifted towards promoting corporate social responsibility, which may or may not prove possible/effective given transnational corporations and global capitalism, but it certainly takes the weight off actors within our territory somewhat.  For example, [these are now a Director's fiduciary duties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act_2006#Directors).  Note that promoting the success of the company is explicitly stated to include:

* the **long term consequences** of decisions
* the interests of employees
* the need to **foster the company's business relationships with** suppliers, **customers and others**
* **the impact on the community** and the environment
* the desire to **maintain a reputation for high standards of business conduct**
* the need to act fairly as between members

The drama of a woman's prison, the escapades of a pair of working class brothers and what happens when young adults visit their parents for dinner are things that happen to us all and are not solely British.

I touched on this discussing the US version of The Inbetweeners the other day in this sub. The US version of the show failed because of the 12 or so episodes they made, only 3 of them were original material, the rest were basically awkward copies of the British series. Surprisingly though, the original scripts were actually very good. The conclusion i came to was that if they made 12 original scripts they would probably have had a successful show on their hands. 

The example of this formula working is of course The Office. The US version showed promise but the first season was like a weird homage to the original, and Steve Carell never looked really comfortable mimicking Ricky Gervais. The second season was basically a do over though and saw the characters evolve and the story deviate from what Gervais and Merchant done. Instead of the cringe worthy boss, Carell became the lovable buffoon and instead of hiding behind your pillow when things went bad for him, you would watch in anticipation that he would be okay.

And that's how the more successful ""remakes"" like the US version of Shameless are doing so well, because they've taken the idea and made it their own.

Using the same logic i fear a court would block the proxy on the same kinda grounds. 

I think the pirate party could do just as well by changing strategy and linking to other proxies doing the same thing. Then the BPI would have to go after the other proxies, but the pirateparty website could keep up links to ones that are currently up.

* edit: proxies that the pirateparty website hotlinked to would only have to have IP addresses, no need to purchase domain names, so it would be very cheap for proxiers to help out with, just very low bandwidth redirects from a disposable VPS

I suppose though, as soon as any temporary proxy receives a cease &amp; desist order, they will fold, and if the BPI get organised they will be able to do that very swiftly on new proxies that pop up.

So maybe the pirate party are trying to pre-empt that situation by winning a new precedent in court.

I would have the winner as the first person to post all the correct answers or if no one has them all correct the person with the most correct before 8pm. Of course everyone will be able to googlefu and cheat with trivia questions, so if we make it about speed as well it remains competitive.  If there's a way the mods can lock down a thread so it can't be modified after 8pm that would help as don't want people editing their answers... whether this is doable depends on how flexible reddit is really.

true,Froolow,null,null,"As an American you are counted as an 'overseas visitor' for the purpose of NHS accounting (fascinating how right we get things sometimes). This means that you will probably need to pay for treatment for your pre-existing conditions.

The NHS provides the following services free to everyone (and are relevant to you):

* A&amp;E

* Family planning services (as in, contraception)

* Treatment for communicable diseases

To receive treatment for these things you literally roll up to a hospital and ask to be treated, although it is polite to make appointments!

To receive treatment for your pre-existing conditions, you will have to visit your local GP (your boyfriend will be registered with one), identify yourself as a foreigner and ask for a referral or a prescription (depending on how complex your medical needs are - 'referral' will be extremely expensive). You will be charged at some point in the proceedings unless - in the opinion of the hospital - you literally *cannot* afford to pay and they feel like being nice. Don't count on this happening though! You may also find that you can't get the drugs you are used to, because our healthcare system is more strongly evidence-based than yours and we sometimes don't buy unproven drugs for non-lifethreatening conditions.

Although just to warn you next year things will have changed slightly because our health system is going through a (pointless and expensive) overhaul - I'd advise you to keep checking the DH website for updates",0,1355169863,null,0,false,0,c7edu0a,t3_148oow,t1_c7edu0a,t3_148oow,null,1430635118,8,false,UKHealthcare,t5_2v0gp,8

true,childoffire02,lfc68,,"Dear ElevenReds,
You have a horribly tough decision to make. Now, I'm not saying that I'm going to make it any easier or anything, but I just want to start with saying good luck on choosing because I've already read some of these and its a toss up for me. Anyway, here is my story... and unfortunately I have to stick to it...

I live in Louisiana, a state in the US that is known for football and baseball. When I was growing up, I had a coach who had, similar to you, had played in AC Milan's youth academy until he was 23, where he got his first and only appearance with the First Team. He had a son that was also my age, and from 4-years old till high school, his son and I played together and learned together under him. Then two terrible things happened. His son developed a genetic disorder called Cystic Fibrosis. His older sister actually had it to and has recently passed away, one of the best and most powerful funerals I've ever been to by the way. Anyway, the son attempted to play soccer his freshmen year in high school but the disease affected him so much that he couldn't play any more. It was a tough time for both of us, not having him thier with me after we had been on a field together our whole lives took some getting used to. Plus, you should have seen his dad, I doubt there is anyone in the world who loves the game more and was more beaten up about how his son could no longer play. 

How I became a Liverpool fan was his dad would show the both of us old games from the 80's that he had on video. For some reason this all red team from England stuck out to me. His son of course loved Milan, but I took to Liverpool like we were more meant for each other than my SO, but don't tell her. Anyway, every weekend after that we would watch two games, we would watch an old Milan game, and we would watch Liverpool play! This started when I was 9 and occured every weekend till I was moving off for college. 

By my Junior year of High School I was getting recruited pretty heavily by colleges like Maryland and Duke to go play soccer for them. The worst thing imaginable happened, within a year long span, I tore both of my hamstrings, causing me to be out my whole junior season and losing much more than a step off of my game. The colleges stopped talking to me and after my senior season came and went I realized that my playing days were over. All do to some bad luck injuries. It took me months to get over it. Almost everyday I would go over to my friends house. It got to where we wouldn't say a word to each other. We would go in the living room and turn on a game. After his dad got home from work he would just walk in, sit on the couch, and watch with us. At night, after two or three games I would get up and go home only to return the next day. Those were the saddest days of my life and the only way I got through them is watching Liverpool. This was when I truly understood what it meant to Never Walk Alone. When I was watching those games it was the only time that I was happy. Our whole lives my friend and I had pictured ourselves as Gerrard(me) and him being Torres. We were able to look back at  our playing days together and we realized we were that exact couple. We played almost exactly like they did, and everytime we watched them we would put ourselves in there shoes and dream that we could have one day been their together. I even still to this day call him Torres, and he calls me Stevie G.

A couple of days ago, his dad called and said he might not make it past Christmas. I didn't know what to say, all I knew is that I had to get him something that would make those last few days bearable. He is actually in the hospital right now, trying to push through for as long as he can. Then you come along and have the perfect gift. A signed Fernando Torres jersey, what it would mean to my Torres to have a jersey with his signature. So I guess my plea is this, I will never be able to watch Liverpool play in Anfield anytime soon, and I definitely won't be able to get a signed Torres jersey to give to him. If I was just able to give him this one thing, that would mean the world to me.

Please don't feel bad if you want to give it to someone else, I should be able to find something to give to him instead.

Thanks for the chance,
childoffire02

Chalobah's loan is up on Jan 1st, and I know he is young, but many who follow the Championship consider him to be one of the standout midfielders so far this season  (rated higher than McEachran). I still think McEachran needs some time to get back to his regular level and would prefer him to stay and help Boro with the promotion push. 

I think keeping Chalobah after Jan 1st and recalling KDB could be a fairly sensible move that would cover a lot of bases for us. And the pair could get ample minutes in the Europa League in the times that Mikel, Ramires, and Lampard are all here and fit.

Another option would be to dip into the January market which would be a good option. I think we'd all love Fellaini but I personally just don't think this move is going to happen. I wouldn't mind taking a look at Strootman or Lars Bender.

Edward IV (1442-83), son of Richard, 3rd Duke of York, was a hugely popular king of the York dynasty. He was a brilliant general and talented politician; indeed, had he not died when his son and heir was only twelve, the house of Lancaster might not have won the War of the Roses. Edward used a white lion as his personal emblem. Edward IV in turn inherited the symbol from his grandmother Anne de Mortimer (which accounts for why some pubs are called the White Lion of Mortimer).

2. We keep him around for the month of January then loan him back to Watford (and only Watford) before January 31st or during the emergency February loan window. This is entirely possible but I can't imagine Watford would love the idea.

3. He renews at Watford.

Rights holders can now contact ISPs to report infringement - with no defined standard of evidence.  The rightsholder can request a list of the anonymised subscribers infringing. This list can then be taken to a judge for a court order to identify them before launching copyright infringement action.

In addition, the Secretary of State can now order ISPs to limit and block infringers connections (those who have reached a threshold) - no measures are defined - the S.o.S can pick and choose. 

The appeal process for this is done assuming that people are guilty unless proven otherwise.]

3. E-Commerce Directives provide legislation for with takedown by defining ISPs and people like YouTube as a conduit.

5. The US's SOPA and PIPA attempted to require ISPs to block access (the Digital Economy Act provisions) but also payment providers and advertisers connected with the sites.

Or re-imagine a classic tale in a classic place but with a Doctor twist.

We'll say that a town in Kansas makes technology to siphon the energy from a nuclear blast as it happens to shunt it off before damage can be done. It was designed for energy, but failed horribly. so bad in fact that i ruined the town. The doctor when navigating near this point in time is pulled in. They land and realize that many time periods seem to be happening at once.  Amazing technology that people on Earth can only dream of. He explains that for some reason Kansas is the moral and almost geographical center of the United States. In this time period, when things were weird in Kansas, it was usually a barometer for the rest of the country. Craziness here, meant certainly there was crazy some place else, Calm here meant the country was reasonably calm and so on. Somehow it has also become an odd time point as well. An unassuming place that is the center of attention for a country who quite often feels they are the center of attention. Quite ironic. But when this failure occurred, it literally shook the town and moved it forward into time. Now on unstable footing in the time stream it is existing in many times at once and so this bubble around Kansas is making it so that any number of things are  happening. As they are amazed the Doctor sees something amiss and soon realizes this whole place is being kind of dreamed by a small sleeping girl. Her dreams are being manifest in this world. After fighting to get into where she is sleeping he gets a chance at the cliche ""we're not in Kansas anymore"", Companion tells him to stop its not very funny and waaay to easy for him to go that route, when he reminds her, ""No, really, we are not in Kansas, we are in this childs head and its worse than I thought"" He explains that the child was very young when this started and they can tell by the way the intensity of the odd events was closer to the hospital, things had longer to be saturated with her dreams. But the affects lessened the farther out, meaning her dreams had range in proportion to her brain power. But as she grew the range grew as well. The companion asks if it can be stopped.  The Doctor explains, as she grows the influence grows and spreads. Again companion asks about it stopping, Doctor, ""yes, when she dies, but when she dies, she stops creating and dreaming and she stops dreaming this place stops being it cant take much more of this. She is both holding this place together and ripping it apart by simply having a wonderful dream.""

Harry Redknapp was a notoriously lax manager, encouraging the players and all their appendages to go about and freely do their own thing. So Gareth neglected the use of underwear to allow me to do my own thing unhindered and we formed an amazing partnership as Gareth was able to run for the full 90 minutes with no discomfort in the groin area.

Following the arrival of AVB, stringent rules were enforced. My good mate Ears was deemed to look too fucking ridiculous and Gareth was forced to have them pinned back over the summer. Then, AVB decreed that underwear was to be compulsory for all players, to prevent unscrupulous publications printing articles which detracted from football and instead placed a disproportionate amount of focus on superficial matters such as how magnificent me and Gareth look in our pure unadulterated glory. Needless to say, we took exception to these new restrictive rules and regulations. My neighbour Hamstring gave out last week in protest and was subsequently fined a months wages for his insubordination. Whereas the players are happy with AVB, us appendages certainly are not. Another article linked today suggested that AVB ignores fitness in training in favour of match preparation. This is not true, this is simply our way of protest.

I am unsure as to how you can like one and not the other, or how you are defining the two? Also assuming you are looking mainly for beers that can be found on draught? Also, if you do want something to drink at home never buy beers in a can, always in bottles,much nicer flavour. 


Old Speckled Hen and Old Crafty hen, the latter I have only ever found in bottles though.

Bombardier. yum and not too heavy. Same goes for Spitfire. 

Pedigree, its an ok beer, I wouldn't dash out for it but it's easily drinkable and less heavy. 

Usually whatever the local brewery to you has on, for me it is Harveys, or Long Man brewery but just go with whatever is on draught. 

They are the ones that spring to mind for being available on draught in most places. But occasionally you might get lucky and find some of the bottled beers on draught. 


Bottles wise-

McEwans Champion, lovely darkish smooth beer, a tad on the strong side but nice all the same. You might find it a bit chewy after coming from lager though.

Fursty Ferret and Tanglefoot, Badger brewery. lighter more golden ales, very pleasant especially in the summer. 

Riggwelter-Black sheep brewery- another dark full bodied beer.

Victory Ale-Batemans

Old Tom- you can only usually get the small bottles as its a strong ale, but lovely full flavour. 

There is lots more variety out there, I love trying any new beers that I see.

**Lamb broth**

Get a decent-sized piece of lamb shoulder, preferably from a butcher, as it will probably be both cheaper and not flown in from New Zealand. If need be, have them cut it into pieces that will fit your largest saucepan while keeping it on the bone.

Fry finely-chopped onions &amp; carrots (dead cheap at this time of year), plus optional fennel and celery, in butter for a few minutes. Add some sliced leeks (also seasonal). If you've got any suitable fresh herbs, such as rosemary or thyme, chop them and add them now. A bay leaf wouldn't go amiss.

Put the lamb shoulder in the pan, and cover with water. Add salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, then simmer on the lowest possible heat for a good 3-4 hours. Skim off the fat that accumulates on the surface of the stock over this time. Take the joint out, leave it to cool, and add some pearl barley (dirt cheap and super tasty) to the broth. This needs about 20-30 minutes to cook. While that's happening, flake all the meat off the bone, chop any large pieces, and return to the pan.

true,SyrochMahr,lfc68,,"Hmmmm.

I grew up in South Dakota and Wyoming, some of the loneliest places in the US. The nearest youth soccer team was easily more than an hour away from me and, while my folks may have been willing to help me get there, my eyes would not. I was born nearly blind in one eye (amblyopia) and have had horrible depth perception my whole life. So soccer was always something that I had to sit out on, even though I had a blast whenever we played it in gym. 

One thing my whole family was heavily involved in was theatre, however. The local(ish) community theatre did a phenomenal production of *Carousel*, in which my older sister (at the time, studying to become a professional opera singer) was cast as Carrie Pipperidge. I sat through all the rehearsals and a large number of productions, getting me closely acquainted with the irresistible anthem, *You'll Never Walk Alone*.

Time passed. I always enjoyed watching my college soccer team (when I could--work usually precluded me from the scene). I tried catching soccer on the TV, but it seemed like the only time I could find it was during the World Cups or Olympics. After watching the England national team play several times on the TV (and being one of the few rooting for them against the US in the opening stage of the last WC), I decided that I liked this chap named ""Gerrard"". He seemed like quite a fellow. So I started to research him and, upon seeing that he captained LFC, I started reading the history of the team. Many wiki articles and youtube videos later, I realized that *this* was the team I would follow, the team that would have me. It felt like everything had come full circle.

I got one of my best friends hooked as well. She went from hating Suarez for his handball against Ghana to screaming when he was suspended for yesterday's game against West Ham. Every weekend, I brew us a pot of tea and we watch the game. Even my girlfriend stopped her work and was watching the Ham game intently. It's become a part of all our lives. 

So that's why I'm here, every day reading and following and learning and loving. That's why, even though I have The Protomen tattooed across my arm (""Hope Rides Alone""), I realized that even though I've never met any of you, I'm not walking alone.

That isn't what I said or suggested, because so many people have never touched any criminalized drug they can only go by what the Media and Government say about them, obviously taking any form of substance will change your perceptions &amp; behaviours.

Some Drugs do this more than others and obviously there are some Drugs which should remain illegal.

Personally I have smoked a fair bit of Weed, I've never ever felt uncomfortable or not in control when I've smoked Weed on it's own.
Alcohol on its own can quite easily turn a person into something completely out of character and unpredictable.

After roughly five hours of working on my art homework which is going to influence my grade extremely, I finished it!

First of all a big THANK YOU to ElevenReds for doing this giveaway, because this gave me the motivation to start up the homework one day before giving it to my teacher. You basically increased my art-grade by some decent points buddy &lt;3

The task was to take a picture of multiple people and transform it into a comic in A1 format. I couldn't think of anything else than LFC, so I chose this awesome picture as my basis: http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2011/02/25/1226011/815427-dirk-kuyt.jpg (this ain't the exact same picture I used as a basis, but its like 90% close to it because I couldn't find the original one on google)

We covered Pop Art of the 50's in class, so i made it a bit poppy ;)

HERE IT IS: http://i.imgur.com/wy3b4.jpg

The reason for the hands, the background, the legs and the shoes being white is basically the fact that I wanted to create a contrast, which is visible in the choosing of red and green. In my opinion white is a great component for this mixture and it also makes the protagonists look epic :)

I am proud of this. Say whatever you want, but it has some style.
submit something creative: CHECK!

Draw/Make/Do something amazing and upload a picture: CHECK!

Well the reason I want one of the trikots is the fact, that Torres and Gerrard basically made me a Liverpool fan back in the day when I was like 13ish. I started getting interested in football and the tradition, the rituals and the stories this club has to share made me love it. 
Torres is still considered as a good player by me, although he has been unlucky at Chelsea.
Furthermore the fact that I don't own an older LFC trikot is pretty sad. I recently bought the 11/12 home trikot when I visited North England and London in summer. Sadly our teacher organized a trip to Manchester -.- and not Liverpool and we just got to see the ""Theatre of Dreams"" which was pretty impressive as well, but the atmosphere was just foreign and ugly. I really want to see Anfield next April when I might go to visit North England again if I manage to get Tickets against Everton @home.

The reason you want one: CHECK!

The best memory this year IMO is the recent game against West Ham. I know that this might be considered as lame since it happened like 2 days ago, BUT i really love those kind of games, where we lead, fall behind and then WIN DAT' SHIT. It's always exciting to see those goals and wake up the whole neighboorhood with my cheering.

Best memory this year: CHECK!

Responsibility is in my opinion spread between various different people and organizations, all acting within a particular social dynamic, of prurient interest in the private lives of celebrities and of people who find themselves in the public eye. And tabloids (the Daily Mail is a tabloid) drive and amplify that dynamic, which is where their responsibility lies.

The whole thing is actually not so dissimilar to one of the incidents which lead to the creation of the Press Complaints Commission. In 1990, Daily Star reporters dressed up as medical staff, sneaked into the hospital room of Gordon Kaye (the Allo Allo actor), and photographed him while he was recovering from brain surgery. Amongst other cases, it led to the collapse of the Press Council, and the formation of the Calcutt committee into press standards.

During a lot of discussions about energy I find the focus is always on electricity and decarbonising the grid. With a huge push and massive investment I could see the UK attaining a carbon neutral grid in 20-30 years, but the plans almost always completely forget the heavy lifting done by oil and natural gas (for transport and heating respectively).

If you don't care about climate change, then you'd just push ahead with coal. There are enormous coal deposits all over the globe, enough to supply us with energy for the forseeable future, but we'd torch ourselves. 

On the other hand if you're serious about reducing emissions then you absolutely have to start electrifying both heating and transport, coupled with huge increases in energy efficiency. But EE will only get you so far, and it is not always the cheapest way of doing things, and quite often it allows you to simply to continue using energy at the same (or greater) rate than you did before. In most densely populated countries you have absolutely no chance of providing transport, heating and grid requirements with renewables. There simply isn't enough space. Nuclear is the only option, whatever flavour, with a reasonable amount of renewables depending on your country's particular resource (wind in the North and Sun in the South).

Problem is, building and maintaining a low carbon (or nuclear) based society will still require enormous inputs of oil. The energy return on energy invested (EROEI) of oil is getting lower every year and everything will get more expensive and more difficult to maintain. The supply chain for building a nuclear power station and dealing with waste is frightening! And we haven't even begun to discuss the investment required to mitigate against climate change. 

We've drastically under-estimated human ingenuity in the passed, so I'm loathe to write us off completely. On a good day, I see a faint glimmer of hope that computing power in the next 20-30 years will enable us to model some complex nuclear reactions and possibly unleash a power source we can't even dream of. On a bad day, I keep thinking of that EROEI of oil, and what that means for the vast majority of humans.",0,1355183233,null,0,false,0,c7ei5li,t3_14m5fw,t1_c7ei5li,t1_c7efqbe,null,1430637146,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

this has been posted before but gives you a little background on the major starting points. Although by your description of your friends, they appear to mostly be fans of post reboot (9th doctor, eccleston) except for the one who loves ""scarfie"" (tom baker, 4th doctor). So I would probably start with 11 (Matt Smith) cause it's a new companion, new writer seems almost new, or with Rose and Eccleston as the 9, cause it's the first of the reboot series. Most of reddit will probably push you towards Rose, however that season is kind of slow as it's a just rebooted show, but if you can get through it the third season (Tennant, 10th doctor, second season) it will all start to come together. Not saying Tennant's first season was bad per say, it has several of my favorite episodes like The Girl in the Fireplace and Doomsday, just it will feel somewhat slow at points and you may question your judgement on this starting point.",0,1355183560,null,0,false,0,c7ei95c,t3_14msak,t1_c7ei95c,t3_14msak,null,1430637198,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Well, it starts back when I was a young lad. Or about 7 years ago when I was in front of the fireplace watching the Champions League game with my pappa. My dad being a United fan, and me not yet a fully developed football fan (I was 13, shit didnt really mean that much too me yet), watched in complete fascination in what was unfolding before us. My dad cursed the skys as Liverpool made the comeback and I became more fascinated and more excited until we won.
Im just kidding that never happened. My parents came from the White Apartheid South Africa where the only people who watch any sort of football are the black people (I hope that doesn't sound racist). So around the time I was 15 and I started getting into football and understanding what it was and how much better it is than American football, Torres was signed for Liverpool. I dont know how I got attracted to the team but I feel it was 90% him. His hair, his style of play, and just how he made everything look so easy. Since I am living in America it would be really hard to watch games, but I always followed the gamecast or whatever the situation for every game. During his tenure at Liverpool, he was my idol. Gerrard and Carragher were good, but Torres was the one who I looked up to and who I defined as Liverpool. When the World Cup in South Africa went on, man I was excited. My home country was hosting it and my favorite player of all time was there. When I watched the final, I was in a house with a ManU and a Chelsea fan and the whole time they were just degrading him saying how his injury will never heal, and that he is done. I screamed as Pedro took a selfish shot and didnt let Torres make a goal, and boy did I scream when he fell. I stuck up for him and as I watched him slide to the ground clutching his thigh, I grew silent. My idol is on the ground and there is nothing I could do about it (considering 2 seconds ago I told everyone to fuck off because he was going to score). When he left, I was heartbroken. Why would he request to leave when we just hit a rough patch and we would snap out of it soon? I could not find any answers as to why he would leave us, and neither could many of the Liverpool fans, but I had to deal with it. Originally by cursing his name and vowing to never watching him play again. Then by making fun of him and saying how hes terrible (that was easy. He has been doodoo at chelsea). And starting in July, I have been watching him again. He has been slowly hitting form and I have no qualms left on him leaving for Chelsea. Why would I? He always managed to score against them no matter how bad of form he was in, but he has yet to score against us. In the past couple months, I have been actively trying to get into my college soccer team next year and he has been a source of inspiration. I have watched countless of old games of him playing and when I make the team, I will quietly thank him because he will be the reason why I did (well him and Christiano Ronaldos documentary, that shits really inspiring) When he scored against Sunderland this weekend, I will admit I was excited.

Why don't the energy companies just get over and done with and charge outrageous prices for fuel? I know it's a defeatist stance and one that is counter intuitive, however I just feel that the prices of energy and fuel will perpetually rise beyond that of the mean living wage. I just can't see an end to when the cost of energy and fuel will stabilize. The way fuel price is going up, which is a sense is inevitable given it's a finite source, so too with all reliable energy sources, seems to be out of touch with the standings of the economy. Does anyone else fail to see what good news exists within the energy and fuel market, especially given that we are continuously lead to believe that they are nothing more than greedy profiteers? Other than providing the necessity for the current standards of human life to continue, does it even make sense for a profiteering companies to have a hold on it. From what I can see, are these companies very much the same as drug dealers, feeding and squeezing not only the poor, but everyone?

true,freedomlights,null,null,"I think the whole issue of being ""Irish""/""Polish""/etc. as an American is a semantic and cultural misunderstanding.

I certainly can't speak for everyone, and as for Irish Americans in particular, I live neither in the North East or in any concentrated Irish community, but in general I think many Europeans just don't understand why Americans use the words they do to mean the things they do. Maybe they don't understand why they're saying it either.

I think for most Americans, the sense of where they come from forms an important part of their family identity. I think the notion that America is a country of immigrants is still strongly felt. Immigration is our history. The cultural landscapes of our big cities have been defined by consecutive waves of immigration. Probably our most recognizable and defining national symbol is a 93 meter tall monument to this legacy.

Someone else I met on Reddit, a Polish national who had lived in the United States, was particularly offended by Americans who felt they were ""Polish"". But he didn't seem to understand that no 2nd generation Polish-American would use that word to lay claim to being a Polish citizen. When people ask ""where is your family from?"" or maybe slightly more crudely out of context (but still conversationally) ""what are you?"" they use these words to talk about their cultural and ethnic heritage. He didn't seem to accept that people could use the same word to mean different things. **He didn't understand that for Americans, your ethnicity and your nationality are *very* distinct identities**.

Those sorts of questions wouldn't ever be your first words to a stranger in the States, but judging from the opinions I hear from many Europeans, I think they would be surprised by how much many Americans like to talk about that sort of stuff. Like I said, having a sense of cultural and ethnic history forms a fun but important and deeply held part of being ""American"".

As for myself, one of my grandparents on one side and two of my great grandparents on the other were immigrants to the United States. Those two great grandparents were from Ireland. Almost everyone has a story. Apart from that of one grandparent who passed away a long time ago, I can tell you the family history of three quarters of my family. I don't think of myself of an ""Irishman/Irish citizen"" but I do *to a certain extent feel* Irish due to the fact that my grandfather's ""Irishness"" was one of the stronger coherent and singular cultural influences in my family.",0,1355184282,null,0,1355244134,0,c7eih19,t3_14jy4l,t1_c7eih19,t1_c7dtf0p,null,1430637335,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

On the rare occasion that they make it past the first series or a pilot, they can come into their own. It's so lazy that I wonder why they don't just show the originals anyway.

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"Alright, let's give this a whirl. In a sense, they are right. The crash of 2007 was about about as bad as they come and the underlying problem (i.e. the fact that everyone is in hock to someone) has not been fixed at all. In fact, on a structural level, nothing has changed. There are a few more regulations here and there, the super-wealthy are a little more bashful in the way they flaunt it but the underlying system is pretty much as it was.

They are also right when they talk about interest rates. What we're seeing at the moment is not normal and *if* interests rates do suddenly go up then that's it: The very foundation that this whole edifice is built on (unfeasibly high housing costs fueled by low cost finance) shake themselves apart and everything is fucked.

**BUT** 

Experiencing the abnormal is surprisingly normal. Every financial crisis is greeted with an 'OHGODOHOGODOHGODTHISISALLNEWANDSCARY' and a certain amount of circles that can't be squared, yet humanity tend to muddle through. As for the present run of woe, yeah, there are some things about it that are uniquely bad (the magnitude of the numbers for one) but it also has a few saving graces - like the fact that employment hasn't totally collapsed (which it really should have). Granted, I don't think people really appreciate the fact that real life is a good two or three years behind the economic curve and that cuts will only *really* start to bite in the next year or so but we've somehow always managed to find a way to kick the  can down the road in the past. I'm fairly sure we'll probably manage to fudge a rickity and temporary-turned-sort-of-permenant solution to it this time round as well.
