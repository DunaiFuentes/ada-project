No I haven't. Not once. I have said that Sharia is inherently misogynistic. This of course by extension implies that some Muslims are misogynistic but the key difference is that it is not inherent. It is a choice.

Whilst there is a spectrum of behaviour found in Muslim countries it cannot be denied that on balance the Muslim world is playing catch up when it comes to women's rights.

You would have to have your head in the sand to think otherwise. Furthermore Islam is a religion and whilst it can be and is conflated with race, I am talking about in essence a political/legal system.

For one thing I'm fairly sure parts of the Koran or similar called for the death of apostates - people who say they are no longer Muslim - and there are other aspects of the Muslim faith which allow for the death penalty with regard to various issues. If you must love, respect and honour everyone, then why would Islamic states so often use the death penalty or even capital punishment? Why do *they* not follow the interpretation you think is right?

My point is that there are many Muslims in the world who would disagree with your interpretation, even though you claim to be following the ideas of scholars from centuries ago. Also I think you'll find that the balance of people who interpret the way you do are, on average, found in countries like the UK rather than countries like the Sudan. (*see end note)

true,goolies,null,null,"&gt;It's illegal to introduce a non-native species, but what do you do if you discover an established breeding population of a non-native species?

Well they would not, as I understand it be offered any legal protection, so there'd be no immediate legal imperative to keep the news quiet for their protection. In fact if anything a small breeding population of large cats would probably present the police/government with a larger issue of protecting the public. Regardless of the action that followed I find it very unlikely that the news would be deliberately kept from the public, especially citing conservation as a reason.


&gt; If a dodo population was discovered in the UK

The wrong comparison to make here, given that all the species we're talking about are not threatened/least concern according to the IUCN (I'm presuming we're not talking about Iberian Lynx, Snow leopard and Tiger sp. here!). Also nobody's talking about killing the cats, recapture would be a much better option.

&gt;Knowledge of legal protection isn't a protection in itself. If anything it only makes the protected species more valuable as they cant be killed legally.

That's presuming the main motivation for killing them would be the value of the cat dead. I would suggest it's more likely farmers would shoot to protect livestock or people presuming this to be the correct course of action for dealing with an escaped big cat. If they were known to be from an established population offered legal protection they would know this was not legally the right course of action.

I'm not religious myself, and frankly I'd rather spend a few hours in the pub with a bunch of gay people than an hour in church with a bunch of Christians.

But in a free society, *all* people are allowed their views, religious or otherwise, however  much we may disagree with them.

The truth is, many faiths are incompatible with homosexuality. It isn't something I agree with. If I did believe in God, I would not want to be part of an organised religion that condemned homosexuality. 

But being gay does not give you the automatic right to dictate the beliefs of other people, however vile or misguided they may be.

Personally, I don't give a crap whether it's called a Civil Partnership, or marriage. But many other people do, for reasons that are very important to them. Not to me or you perhaps, but to them. That is an issue that gay people also have to reconcile themselves with. You can't claim to be of a particular faith, and to believe in the tenets of that faith, while demanding that the ones you don't like quite so much be changed to suit you individual preferences.

&gt;Speaking exclusively to the official Celtic website, the manager said: “I actually played against him when he was on loan at Luton for Nottingham Forest and often wondered what happened to him, as he was on loan from Bolton at the time and I was really impressed by him.
 
&gt;“So John Park and myself got talking, and his name came up again. We did a bit of homework on him since then, and I think he’s been in excellent form for his club this year and on the verge of international recognition. To get him on a pre-contract is a good bit of business again for the club.
 
&gt;“He’s strong, technically good, quick, and he’s very good in the air. At 24, he’s at a good age. He had a bad injury and was out of football for around a year but it looks like he’s come back stronger than ever, and I’m pleased with the signing.
 
&gt;“I think his all-round game is very good. He has been playing at a decent level of football from a young age but what I like about him is his physical qualities. He already knows the British game, so I don’t think it will take him too long to adapt to the rigours of Scottish football.""

Never heard of this guy but I'm quite optimistic based on Lenny's past signings. Welcome to Celtic Jarosław!

true,strolls,null,null,"That seems like rather a simplistic view to me - sure, it *feels* very right when you look at it the way you do, but really it's a lot more complicated than that.

If you think about this from the point of view of economics, money is no more than barter tokens, and when we arbitrarily assign a whole load of barter tokens to one person then (due to supply and demand) another person effectively becomes less wealthy.

It's popular here on this subreddit to say ""they should have to work for a living"", but that's a standard that's only applied to poor people - never the rich children of inherited wealth.

So I don't see why your children should suddenly, on your death, become more wealthy than people who have, genuinely, worked for their money. 

Many of the wealthiest people in this country - the so-called 1% - come from families that have been rich for hundreds of years. We can trace wealth back to the Norman Conquest, when William came along and stole land from the Saxons and gave shares to the barons who had supported him. In those days land was the sole basis of wealth, the means of agricultural production, and seeing as how we all basically need a roof over our heads, I would argue that it is still one of the most significant factors of wealth equity. Yet there has never been any attempt to redistribute our nation's wealth - we're basically buying into an economic system that stems from an invader who set himself up as king and took what he wanted.

It's popular to say, since the fall of the USSR, that ""communism has failed"", and if we talk to any entrepreneur they will laud capitalism as rewarding people who take risks and provide goods and services that people want and which benefit society. Capitalism is said to reward people fairly on a free-market basis, yet inheritance rewards people who were simply born lucky. 

As I see it, none of us really questions inheritance because it is so long historically established and because it mostly suits us. Of course the feudal lord wanted to look after his kids, of course the serf wanted his son to farm his strip of field when he was gone. But we never pretend that was fair - the poor simply had no means to change their position. 

When you think about it, property is a social construct. We can see [who is holding the guitar](http://i.imgur.com/AA6Yg.gif), we can see [what colour the ball is](http://i.imgur.com/BF4c8.jpg) - we can even determine that scientifically, based on the proportions of coloured photos it reflects - but we have no way to determine who *owns* those things. 

Ownership is a base instinct in us that we can trace back to two neanderthals squabbling over a spear that one of them has fashioned. As children we all exhibit the same behaviour in the schoolyard, crying ""mine, mine, mine"" as the bully tries to steal our pokemon cards. And it's certainly useful and it gives us feelings of comfort and security, but I don't believe that it's the same kind of ""natural"" right as those of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, nor is it like the right to a private and family life. 

When it comes to shared and limited resources, like land, and the need all of us have for a roof over our heads, and perhaps a few acres in which to grow a crop to sustain ourselves, one person's ownership of these kinds of property inherently *deprives* others of those resources. Dead people cannot own property, and inheritance is a construct that our society *chooses* to perpetuate. We choose it because ""it suits us"", but does it really suit each of us equally?

Sure, you want to look after your kids, but do you have a fair ""right"" to your wealth if you were raised in better circumstances than the man in the next street? Do you have a right to that wealth if you had a more privileged education or your parents paid the deposit on your first flat? The other guy should be unlucky because he was born unlucky, and his children should be poorer because they were born poorer?

Sure, you want to look after your kids, but how about we, all of us, look after all of our kids, and we do so equally? How about when a multi-millionaire dies, you get an equal share of his wealth, because it's redistributed between all citizens? Do you then begrudge a share of your wealth, upon your death, going to a couple raising their kids in a council house in the shit end of London?

All I can say is, I'm alright, Jack. Inheritance stands to place me, irrespective of my own accomplishments, amongst the wealthiest 2% of the UK population. That's not so much I couldn't piss it away quickly on a nice house and a sports car, but it's also enough that I can live modestly without ever having to work again. The richest 2% of the population, into which I will fall, owns 28% of the wealth in this country, as does the poorest 75% of the population. So inheritance renders me, the 2%, an average of 45x richer than my peers in the 75%, purely by arbitrary chance.

My point is about the relevance of arguments against interracial marriage that are not common currency in the UK and (AFAIK never have been) to gay marriage.  

We do not do ourselves justice by bringing in counter arguments to US positions here.  The only arguments I have heard against interracial marriage in this country are about the children (see below for a ripe quote from Hansard).  This is the same argument heard about gay adoption but has no relevance for gay marriage.

We chopped off their heads before anyone else in Europe, then because it didn't work out at the first attempt the rich people brought back a more tame version of the unelected dictatorship in order to rule in their name, and they're still doing it today. Meanwhile the serfs were allowed to dance again, and today their children all faint at the thought of having tea in the Sachs-Coburg-Gotha garden whilst complaining that no ones listening to them.

I hear too much of people having child after child after child expecting to get benefit, maybe if they practised safe sex they would not be in this position?

The sooner people stop relying on the government and hard working tax payers to fund their lives the better. being on benefits is meant to be hard, its meant to be tough, its meant to encourage you to do anything to get off benefits.

Maybe we should bring back the old style 'Single Mother Lodges' for children having children, bring back the Welfare Centres from when I was a kid (going every month with benefit books to get free tinned goods etc) food vouchers, help people survive on the minimum they need but don't lavish money on them,

true,Fuckingyourgranny,null,null,"&gt;You're veering onto the very complicated issue of religion here. I have no problem with gay rights. But not at the expense of everyone else's.

Then you should be in favour of the law being changed, since at the moment it's the rights of gays and those religions that are ok with gay marriage that are being infringed upon.

&gt;I'm not religious myself, and frankly I'd rather spend a few hours in the pub with a bunch of gay people than an hour in church with a bunch of Christians.

OK

&gt;But in a free society, all people are allowed their views, religious or otherwise, however much we may disagree with them.

I completely agree. A, for example, catholic priest is more than welcome to think I'm a sinner. He can be of the opinion that I'm going to burn in hell, that I'm an abomination or that my relationship isn't meaningful. I give not the slightest fuck what people opposed to gay marriage *think*. It's when the law supports their bigotry and makes it illegal for two men or women to marry that I have a problem. They can carry on having their views, I just want the law to be changed, not their minds.

&gt;The truth is, many faiths are incompatible with homosexuality. It isn't something I agree with. If I did believe in God, I would not want to be part of an organised religion that condemned homosexuality.

Has someone suggested otherwise? I take it you're under the impression that churches would be forced to marry gay couples or something of the sort? No one is suggesting that this should or would happen. No catholic church is forced to marry a protestant to a sikh. A jewish temple doesn't have to marry a muslim and a hindu. No religious institution would be required to marry anyone they don't want to.

&gt;But being gay does not give you the automatic right to dictate the beliefs of other people, however vile or misguided they may be.

Then it's a good thing that this is another thing that no one is trying to do.

&gt;You can't claim to be of a particular faith, and to believe in the tenets of that faith, while demanding that the ones you don't like quite so much be changed to suit you individual preferences. 

The current law is what's forcing changes onto people's religion because of someone else's different religion. As it stands the quakers and reform jews and fuck knows how many other religious denominations are not allowed to marry a gay couple *despite their religion being ok with that*.

Learn why Milton Keynes is called what it is and you're half way there.

Here's a quick summary (you'll learn more from any dissenters than me ;)


Lib Dem (Centre)

   - Pros - Libertarian. Tend to support the needs of a large middle class (normally the outcome of good    government rather than the cause). 

   - Cons - Tend to miss the big picture (i.e. Happy to let the most vulnerable elements of society get fucked over by the most predatory, who also prey on the middle class anyway (see Tories below)).

Labour (Left Wing)

   - Pros - Aim to support the working man and protect him from big business. Tend to build infrastructure and public institutions which benefit everyone.

   - Cons - Let unions take the piss. Allowed ""Safety net"" of benefits be exploited by scumbags. Political correctness &amp; hypocracy (but mostly harmless).

Tories (Right Wing)

   - Pros - Don't let benefit frauds get away with it. In the pocket of big business so tend to have support of the 1%. Tend to do the ""Right thing for the wrong reasons"" due to moral flexibility.

So all that's left is to wonder how they'll be avoided. And the way they've been avoided has been generally nonsensical. The Doctor was saved because Amy wished really hard to bring him back to existence -because she has the power to do that, and birth universes and things-. Then the Doctor was saved again because a recently-introduced machine filled with tiny people pretended to be him when River, who is sort of a time lord but not really and was for some reason dropped in a lake in a space suit, shot him against her will, briefly breaking time in a way that allowed the show to get even more self indulgent than usual."")

The voting as it ebbs and flows generally pushes the country towards a happy medium. As Labour became a more popular party for example, it moved towards the centre away from where the SNP is now (free education, all that good jazz) and more towards the right - in order to just satisfy more people's wishes.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor.

Rather than do a nice, slow reveal that makes sense, he did one that comes off as extremely rushed(span of two episodes) and then doesn't touch it again till the end of the season, which also comes out of no where(not in the good way either).  Then there is the fact that no one between the finale and *Lets Kill Hitler* seems to care about the missing child at all.  It doesn't take much to bring this up, maybe just a line or two(""Doctor, I know you like to help children, but we're trying to find my daughter right now.  We don't have time for this!"") in each of the episodes, a five minute moment of depression between Amy and Rory about not having any success, or any other number of things that could have been added with less than five minutes work.  Oh, and then theres the much bigger question: Why does she have to be related to Amy and Rory at all?  There is no real good reason for this that I can see besides insulting everyone's intelligence.

But as for River being a murderer, that never bothered me and it worked out well.

true,[deleted],null,null,"What River is, to me, is disappointing.  A character comprised of nothing but wasted potential.  She's the incredibly, shrinking epic.

When we first met her she was this strange, older woman from the doctor's future. A Sarah-Jane is reverse.  She talked about an ancient doctor so much grander and more powerful than ours and she had a sonic that was coated in verdigris and rust and looked ancient.  She was a relic of the Doctor's ancient future and she described the incredible things he would become while also accentuating the strangeness of his timeline. 

Then she showed up in series 5 and I was like ""Oh, neat."" and my head was filled with new ideas.  A companion always meeting the doctor out of order, spanning hundreds of his years.  Every season or 2 doing a ""River"" episode with younger and younger actors.  Strange tales and twisted timelines.... and then she showed up again and I was like ""oh"" and I realized the grand sprawling mythos I had built in my head like an ancient Mayan ziggurat was just a pile of rocks.  She wasn't from the distant future, she was from 2 years away.  She wasn't describing some strange, ancient doctor, she was describing 11.  She wan't old because of her years and years with the doctor, she was just old.

But then the regenerating baby happened and one more time I let myself get excited Because, if she can regenerate, they might have her span the ages yet.  New actors, with different faces.  Younger and younger.  A tragic love story though the seasons, forward and in reverse.  Across different actors and different writers and different decades.  And then she only had 3 regenerations and we saw them all.  Hell, even the idea of her being with future doctors has been all but killed by the miniepisodes showing 11 taking her to the singing towers.

She could have been so great but Moffat didn't want to let anyone else have her so he ran her into the ground instead of letting her become part of the fairy tale. ",0,1326863881,null,0,false,0,c3ibcvd,t3_ojwhj,t1_c3ibcvd,t3_ojwhj,null,1428199567,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

&gt;In September, Lorraine Heggessey, the Controller of BBC One persuaded BBC Worldwide that as their plans for a Doctor Who film were nowhere near fruition, BBC television should be allowed to make a new series. A deal with Russell T Davies to produce the new series was quickly struck, and on September 26, the BBC announced that Doctor Who would return to BBC One in 2005, produced by BBC Wales.

&gt;**As a result, the ""official"" nature of the Shalka webcast was in doubt from even before it was released** After the web cast, in February 2004, plans for sequels were indefinitely shelved. For a period, it was unclear if the new television Doctor would be the Ninth or Tenth Doctor, but this was settled in April 2004 when in an interview with Doctor Who Magazine, Davies announced that the new television Doctor (played by Christopher Eccleston), would be the Ninth Doctor, relegating the Richard E. Grant Doctor to unofficial status.




The 2005 series was already being planned *before* it was webcast. If the BBC wanted Shalka considered canon, they would've kept it canon and would've told RTD that he would be casting for the 10th Doctor, not the 9th. I really doubt RTD has enough power to override the BBC.

And given all the retconning that goes on in Doctor Who universe, it seems silly to get het up over a webcast most people haven't even seen. Even the author considers it to be a 'doctor who unbound' story - that is, *not* set in the canon universe.

&gt;Although it was **intended to be an ""official"" continuation of the television series** that had ended in 1989, the revival of the programme in 2005 relegated it and the Richard E. Grant's Ninth Doctor, to non-canonical status. 

...

&gt;When Shalka was announced in July, 2003 for broadcast in November, the possibility of Doctor Who returning to television screens still seemed remote and BBC Worldwide were shopping around for another possible movie deal. **As a result, BBCi announced, with BBC approval, that the Doctor appearing in Shalka would be the ""official"" Ninth Doctor.**

When it was first created, it was an official, canon part of the whoniverse.  Then they got the idea of making an actual TV show and retconned it because of RTD.  Not because RTD asked them too (he didn't ""override the BBC""), because they had a live action TV show he was making and decided it was more expedient to just pretend it didn't happen.  But to say that Shalka was never an official, canon Doctor is wrong.

true,mattpenney89,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"I am by no means an expert but here's my opinion on these:

&gt;What does the TARDIS look like without the chameleon field? They did mention that the TARDIS only looked like a police box because The field got stuck like that and it just kind of caught on...

I don't think it looks like anything, in that it always looks like what the chameleon field says it looks like. Even if it had a ""default"" look (other than phone box) it would still be the chameleon circuit making it look like that.

&gt;What would happen if someone punched a hole in the side of the TARDIS? Is that even posible? Would the hole be bigger on the inside too?

I'm torn with this one, I seem to recall from some of the original series that the Tardis is basically indestructible, The Titanic did crash into it, but we don't see what it looked like from the outside. I think the hole would be the same size outside as inside, but I don't really have any reason to base that on.

&gt;When ever someone picks up on the Doctor and his odd adventures through time, why do they always lock on to one of his regenerations, but not the other 11+? The 9th and 10th doctors both had their own little ""fan clubs"" who were trying to figure out who he is, comleate with website, why didn't the key words ""Doctor Blue box"" come up for the 10th doctor guys, but Rose found it Immediately for the 9th?u

It works better for the plot? I guess if you didn't realize he could change his face you'd never make the connection. Maybe Rose saw things for 10 but it didn't register because she was looking for 9.

&gt;True, you can't kill a stone, but you sure can smash it to pieces! If you can smash a Weeping Angel, than what becomes of it's remains after you look away?


No idea, They are supposed to be super-powerful so maybe it would just re-form


&gt;On that note, If the 10th doctor can piss off queen Elizabeth before the first time he met her, why hasn't say, the 13th doctor done something similar to the 6th?

I've been with them since around 2005 and I never experience any choking at so called ""peak times"" or any other issues. I have the unlimited package and it really does mean unlimited. I use Xbox Live, OnLive, I download a LOT of music and films (all legally of course and for purely backup purposes) and I stream a lot of stuff too and I've never been sent a letter or warned about fair use.

The only problem I have with BT is the customer service and the Indian call centres. The fact the call centres appear to work off a very defined script makes it difficult when faults occur as they often ask you to do pointless things like deleting cookies or defragging your PC when it's obviously a PSTN or broadband issue.

I'm not the most experienced person when it comes to broadband but I like to think I do have some basic technical knowledge so I generally know what the fault is and to perform all the basic fixes (router resetting for example) before I call BT so the fact BT have no tech savvy people in the offshore centres and just the script users sometimes makes it hard to start the process of getting the fault fixed.

Without an active Chameleon circuit a TARDIS looks like [this](http://images.wikia.com/tardis/images/5/59/Row_of_TARDISes.jpg). That's a row of them.

&gt;What would happen if someone punched a hole in the side of the TARDIS? Is that even posible? Would the hole be bigger on the inside too?

It happened in Voyage of the Damned but that was dumb and makes no sense.  The TARDIS is a pocket dimention with a door (the police box) that moves through time and space.  any hole should be the same size on either size (see: the front door)

The inside and outside are in different dimensions (that's established.) So there's really no way to see what the TARDIS would look like without the chameleon circuit because the outside hull as the other side of the inside doesn't exist in our dimension, and there's no way to get to that dimension on that side of the TARDIS. 

The closest you'll get to the ""natural"" TARDIS would probably be what it looks like while on Gallifrey, and there it will change to blend in to the Time Lord society. In fact, it may be possible to construct a TARDIS without a chameleon circuit, because that's mainly to allow inconspicuous travel to other planets and time periods. (The Doctor pretty much does this in The Doctor's Wife.) But you'll still have to create a hull in our dimension if you want to make it bigger on the inside, and that still won't accurately represent the inside shape.

It's also worth noting that if you could see the Doctor's TARDIS from the outside while in the inner dimension, it wouldn't always be the same. We know very well that the TARDIS can archive and delete rooms, and change it's structure pretty much at will.

true,ElectricCube,null,null,"We all meet at the prearranged venue. If there are any new /r/nottingham people then full introductions are gone through, then everyone proceeds to buy a drink. Warning: Do not offer to buy anyone a drink at this point, as the group is still conversing as a whole and you'll end up getting quite a few. Get you own drink and wait.

As you'll be new, you won't know anyone. Keep an ear out for keywords in conversations until you hear someone discussing a topic you like. Jump right in there. Butt in if need be, be abusive and rude, but get your point in there too.

If the keyword tactic fails, look around for another 'Forever Alone' person and strike up a conversation with them. They'll be more than happy to engage in a chat with a fellow Redditor. This won't last long because if they are on their own they're either socially inept or have no common interests to discuss with anyone. Heres the key. This person is your best buddy for the entire night. This is where you offer to buy drinks. As he/she will be the only person listening to you, the most you'll need to purchase in a round will be 2.

Always try and time your toilet breaks so you're not left being forever alone while your best friend relieves his/herself. Otherwise you may find someone approaching you. This is bad for two reasons. Your best friend will feel left out when they come back and the round size will have increased to 3. The only exception to this rule is if you're attempting to get a Redditor into bed. Join in a conversation with the group they're in and just buy all the drinks, forever. Make sure the same tactic isn't being used against you or you'll end up in a drinks buying fight which will probably put both of you off.

Venue changes are tricky. It's difficult to stay with your best friend without looking like you don't want to be seen with anyone else. While walking to the next establishment, you can't accelerate past a group of Redditors and towards your best friend without everyone knowing something is wrong. Be careful, walk with the largest group, you don't have to say anything as it will probably be cold, so just fake keeping your hands warm. Arrive at new veune and repeat the above. This pattern will continue all night.

At some point, a particular Redditor will expose himself and get us all chucked out. Either that or he'll attempt to insert the Reddit alient head on a stick into a bodilly crevasse. This will result in the same action. Make sure it's not your crevasse.

If you're going to write a story around an evil Time Lord, it makes much more sense to use Omega.  They've established that ""outside the universe"" is a loophole around the Time War, Omega was trapped in an alternate (antimatter) universe and he has a tendency to pop up around big anniversaries.

The major problem with any evil Time Lord story these days though is that since the revival, Time Lords leave such huge footprints on the universe.

Sharia is a legal framework, it is not a person or race. It is instructions/guidelines on how to live, and treats women as second class citizens compared to typical western cultures.

Muslims are people who accept Allah as the one and only true God and there is a broad spectrum of how the Quran and Hadith are interpreted and implemented. For example Turkey Vs Mogadishu.

Furthermore, anyone who practices Islam chooses to do so, unless of course they have been coerced because of the ramifications of apostasy in certain Islamic communities.

Race and racism have nothing to do with my argument. Let me repeat that. Race and racism have nothing to do with my argument.

I don’t want to insult you personally so please appreciate the context that I use the following, but you are what Lenin would call a ‘useful idiot’. You have no appreciation of the greater context of what we are talking about and have been so demoralised you will arrive at extraordinary positions to defend your political correctness, such that women being valued half as much as men is something that belongs in a post-enlightenment modern society.

Can you genuinely not see you are calling black ‘white’ and there is no substance whatsoever to your argument, hence creating positions you think those of who converse with you hold in order to proceed with the one-track argument that is seemingly the only weapon on your arsenal?

For large multinational companies there are more attractive opportunities globally for O&amp;G companies to invest their money in currently. With the fiscal regime changing every few years it puts off companies off from investing in the North Sea. 

And for smaller operators who traditionally make up a lot of the drilling activity in the North Sea are now faced with capital problems. 

This is what Woodmac had to say

&gt;The SCT hike in this budget will reinforce the perception of the UK as an unstable fiscal regime.  The increase came as a surprise to many in the industry but the government is following a well trodden path by increasing its take as oil prices increase – most notably the introduction of SCT in 2002 and its increase to 20% in 2005.

and

Many of the UK focused companies still have attractive development projects and they will continue to invest.

Ok, so here's the skinny, since you've just recently landed here.

While doctor who is actively airing, this subreddit is great - lots of discussion, speculation, information, behind-the-scenes, etc.

While doctor who is on sabbatical, this subreddit is largely indistinguishable from [r/doctorwhocirclejerk](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwhocirclejerk).

The other thing is, if you complain about the current status of the subreddit, or if you in any way make an inflection that sounds like you might be implying that this isn't the greatest subreddit ever, you get downvoted.  If you say ""you know, I didn't really like the writing in this episode""?  Downvote.  If you say ""I'm really tired of these plot threads left dangling"", you get downvoted.  If you say ""Martha was not a good companion"", you get downvoted.*

This subreddit is strictly group-think.  At this point, I am almost entirely here so that I can be on top of production news, and so I know when new eps air.  It sure as shit isn't for one more cake picture or one more butterface in a tardis dress.

Sorry, but that's the truth.  Like I said, while Who is airing, it's great, but otherwise, it's a cesspool of memes and irrelevant asinine shit.

However, the health secretary at the time of Hillsborough is now a senior member of the cabinet again, so there may well be an ulterior motive for not releasing the papers yet.

We have the [12th highest revenue among European clubs](http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GB/uk/industries/sportsbusinessgroup/sports/football/deloitte-football-money-league-2011/c774a9e481a7d210VgnVCM1000001a56f00aRCRD.htm). People keep saying his wages with City are too high, we're priced out of it. This is only true if there is another club willing to match the stupid money City pay him, because he's clearly not wanted back there. He won't have any choice but to take a wage cut unless he wants to spend the next two seasons knocking around with the City reserves.

So I guess you've got 3, maybe 4 teams from Italy in the frame, and the chances of them being interested seem slim, especially the two big powerhouses, and I'm not convinced anyone in Italy but them could financially outmuscle us, especially since their CL place allocation dropped to 3.

He won't go to Spain because the big two won't be interested and the rest can't afford to beat us, plus he'd have no chance of ever winning anything again - don't forget he joined Arsenal after their last win, was cup tied in his first season when they went to the CL final, and wasn't involved in City's FA Cup win last year, being away on loan in Spain. The guy hasn't won a trophy in his career since the French League Cup in his first season with Monaco - this could be a big factor in his decision.

In Germany it's only Munich who can beat us, and they aren't too likely to be interested either given the current strength and youth of their forward line.

There's only really PSG, Lyon and Marseille in the frame in France I think. Only the first of those could definitely beat us - they're probably the most likely possible destination, but they've got a few big players already and could quite easily come out of the current window with Tevez too, and if not it seems likely they'll sign another striker before the summer anyway. They're also in a lower rated league which would likely be a factor.

So that leaves England of the big European leagues. City are out obviously, Arsenal aren't going to take him back and can't beat us either, and can you see United looking at him? That leaves Chelsea and Liverpool, both of which seem hugely unlikely, and I think we wouldn't be far off matching any Liverpool offer anyway. Not to mention there's a very good chance we have CL football to offer him that they won't - Chelsea might not even be able to offer that.

Other than that, his only options are lucrative but essentially career ending moves to Russia or the Middle East, and I really don't see him taking that option in the prime of his career.

Look, I'm not saying it's nailed on, and I'm not even convinced keeping him is best for the club as yet - if we really are aspiring to be up there challenging for the title we maybe need someone a little more clinical as our main man - but to say it's definitely not going to happen is just plain daft. If we want him at the end of this year he will not be out of our reach.

He has two years left on his City contract after this - assuming we're offering 100k a week less than his City contract, that's only(!) 10m he'd be losing out on over the two years. Given we can get him for 12-14m transfer fee, we can afford to offer him that 10m in bonuses, some performance based maybe, some signing on. Adebayor doesn't lose out, our wage structure remains intact. And that's max - it could probably be pulled off with half that bonus amount. Suddenly he's not costing any more than any other striker who would improve the team.

I know the modern world of football can make us all a bit cynical at times, but you don't get to be a professional footballer without being dedicated to it, without loving playing the game. The idea that Adebayor will sit out his City contract in their reserves during the prime of his career just for the extra cash is taking that cynicism too far.

And don't forget, even if he wanted to do that, City are going to do everything they can to stop that happening - they're going to be really close to a ban when it comes to the new FFP rules, and will want him off the books completely, as soon as possible.

You really need to learn about the renaissance.

The renaissance was the greatest renaissance mankind has ever known; it lasted 300 years and brought us amazing Art, Science and Mathematics, Humanism and Philosophy the likes of which the world hadn't seen for a thousand years or more. Humanity literally became enlightened where it was once little more than a caste system, a structured cell of slaves acting as proteins and the aristocracy and religious groups acting as a nuclei. People didn't really know how to think, they just lived.

The internet is good, and its the best technological development in recent years but we're no way near the renaissance.

Entire genres of music have developed purely on the internet. There are people like Adele and... Justin Bieber &gt;.&gt; ... Who's fame is owed entirely the the use of the internet. Any aspiring film maker can put his work on Youtube for all to see.  

The Internet isn't effecting Science and such in the same way; though it has made it significantly easier for anyone to learn about it now. But I think the internet is more of a social renaissance than a scientific one. Country-based boundaries are all but dissolving in the face of world-wide communication that's easier than walking to the shop and buying a heavily censored/filtered newspapers.  

Worldwide protests, like the one against SOPA, can be arranged and carried out without even needing to leave your own home. The same goes double for charitable stuff; If a tsunami had hit Japan a hundred years ago, it's would have been Japan's problem and most of the rest of the world probably wouldn't even hear about it, much less be able to send aid. 

What you need to remember is that, as you said, the Renaissance lasted 300 years. We're barely 30 years, if that, into seeing just how much the internet can do, and it's already altered the fundamental way in which most people live their lives.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"I worked for a London hospital for ten years (89 - 99)

Over those ten years, I was paying a large chunk of my not-very-good wages to our union.

Our union rep had been given the title 'Micro Support Manager' years previously, and it was decided (once I'd installed and deployed 500+ PC's by myself) that she should really be...well, managing.

As a result, I spent the latter years doing the same amount of work (more, in fact, as we took on more hospitals) while she continued to get paid more for 2.5 days work than I got per week.

What was she doing to achieve this salary? Nothing. Zero. She had no technical or managerial knowledge *at all* - didn't even know how to drag a file from one window to another. Any technical meetings were attended by me, for the same reason.

There were other union reps around, most of whom were just as bad - one used to regularly fall asleep at his desk with his hand on the mouse to make it appear as if he was browsing. I found that these reps were never sacked when deadwood-clearing went on, because their union 'duties' made them out-of-bounds.

Now, all this would be funny if, over that period, the UK Gov. hadn't regularly shafted all the health workers below Doctor-level with way below inflation rises - the unions were, to my mind, supposed to stop this sort of thing from happening...but it became apparent that I was paying subs so that for most workers, our union could roll over and say 'oh, alright then' every time our wages went down.

This became even more hilarious when one year they decided we'd get a 1.1% rise and another 1.1% *later in the year* (at which point I put my hand up and said 'can we put off doing 1.1% of the work until later in the year too, then?'). And again, the unions did nothing.

Consider it first line enquiries. Making sure that everything is as it should be.

Anything that's missing gets resolved here, typically. 

It's then passed on to the departmental admissions people as they have a far better handle on the ins and outs - the ability to see through blaggers and also see how viable a ""look, I've not got this, but do have this, and it's just as good""-esque things are. 

We've also got a distinct international admissions section. I have *no* clue what goes on there as the international stuff is a total mystery to me, as you'd expect. Things work very, very differently abroad.

Funny stuff? There's the usual amusing stories in relation to things that people have put in their applications and so on. Not really any dirty stories that come to mine. Terrible examples? A lot of the applications are led by sixth form colleges, but there's always a few oddities in there, too.

I don't feel the story arc overshadowed the individual stories or characters (except maybe one or two instances this last season), and I totally disagree with your opinion of the Doctor. I think he has been written better than he was under RTD, and Smith is the best Doctor I've seen since my first (T Baker). He is still a dark, lonely, yet ruthless character, with added brooding. It's what the Doctor does. He evolves with each incarnation.

I agree there were issues with the main story arc last season, though, which became more noticable near the end.

If I remember correctly, they didn't go back and rescue baby River because, well, paradox. To say they were 'happy' for River to go through all that is not right. The pain was shown sometimes by Amy. It could have been (quite a lot) better expressed in the writing, but it wasn't totally absent.

This is such an easy default position and one that I notice nearly all Liverpool fans fall back on. Let's consider that football matches have been played in this country since the late 1800's. Imagine the pre-war crowds at Wembley - over 100,000 **standing** fans. OK, let's look at smaller stadiums with little or no policing around that time and far worse facilities than Hillsborough in 1989. Fulham Football Club, a league two side in 1938, recorded over 50,000 standing fans at a cup game (their record). Manchester City, nearly 90,000 for their cup game in the late 40s at Maine Road. Even Second Division side Crystal Palace in the late 70's recorded a 50,000 record crowd at Selhurst Park, nearly all standing.

Policing has never been the issue. Indeed Sheffield Wednesday had been playing at Hillsborough since 1899 and knew its limitations which is why THEY requested the specific numbers of police available to them on match day. Had they expected the thousands of additional fans without tickets they would have requested more police to manage the crowds. The police were unable to handle such large numbers of fans because neither they nor the club expected so many to show up. The police had to deal with exceptional circumstances and were heavily undermanned against the number of fans at the stadium.

I have been researching this since the late 90's and it is far too easy to blame the police, especially if you support the team whos fans were so badly affected or know little or nothing about the disaster. I dont believe the truth will ever come out and the police will end up having to accept some, if not all, of the responsibility simply to make it go away which ironically would not be justice at all.",0,1326981575,null,0,false,0,c3ij2k5,t3_on3rp,t1_c3ij2k5,t1_c3iivoy,null,1428203251,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I think it is this same 'disorganisation' that gives rise to the criticisms you also level; the vagueness, the odd approaches.

I agree that corporate lobbying or tax avoidance and similar issues is a threat - a concern shared by Occupy.

I think the flaw in your thinking is seeing Occupy as a congruent group - an organisation of something of that nature. It is not! The disorganisation, the rabble, the diasporic multitude of priorities and concerns are because it is a loose collection of individuals, each of whom have differing priorities, concerns, aims, criticisms and goals. 

When they stand side by side they are of course a disorganised rabble with unclear direction! They are the civil, well-behaved anger of a large sub-section of the public. People like you and I *are* angry. And frustrated. And importantly, unclear about what the solutions are.

Perhaps Occupy *would* have achieved 'more' if it was a little more centralised, a little more mindful of of its style of protest. But requesting as much is asking it to be something it just isn't. 

It was a fascinating loose collection of individuals voicing concerns shared by more than just those who directly participated, and we must be mindful of what it *did* accomplish. So, so many concerns and campaigns take their complaints to the streets in protest in London. Very few make the papers.

Occupy had consistent and often quite positive coverage *across the world*. I am sorry if that got your hopes up and made you dream of a fairer world, because that could never be delivered right away. Even getting notions like 99% vs 1% into common discussion is a resounding achievement.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think the criteria for the new stadium should essentially be:

* Single Tier Kop

The Kop is a stand for our traditionally loyal and most vocal fans, aesthetically the single tier ads to the sense of unity and family as well as acts as a great red wall behind the goal. The new stadium has to inherit the same kop... only bigger.

* Expandable

60,000 is a good size stadium, more season tickets will be sold, on average you'll expect 58-59000 to pack the stadium weekly and it'll generate revenue. On the other hand Liverpool still doesn't sell out for league cup games, FA cup games and Europa league matches. So it won't look too empty at 60,000. The stadium needs to be ready for expansion though assuming we establish ourselves as a regular Champions league competitor and league title challenger. That's when 70-75,000 fans a week will pack out the stadium.

* Ease of access

Anybody who's been to Anfield on match day will understand what a pain it is to get into the ground 15 minutes before kick-off. I had to walk 30 minutes when we played Chelsea in Europe. 

* Sell the name rights

No one's going to like this, but money is money. Apparently money determines good teams from the great teams. Selling the naming rights to a big brand or company won't make stadium any less special. I think the Emirates stadium is a great ground for example. People will still refer to the new Stadium as Anfield, it's not like everyone calls Upton Park the 'Boleyn Ground'. Also it's best to leave the namesake of the ground to our past. As much as I love to associate Liverpool with the countless success we achieved at Anfield, we need to draw a line under the history and begin trying to create some more. 2007 was the last time we reached a cup final. Liverpool are still a powerful and respected team but we're not a successful we'd like to think we are at the moment.

true,kr239,eng-eastsusex,Portslade,"As i'm currently living here, and having used the hospitals here numerous times over the last 12 years, i can state that the french system is vastly superior to the NHS in almost every way. For one, the part private/part public operation works to deter the 'moaners' - the sort of people that clutter up A&amp;E because they sat on something sharp, or cut their thumb - the sort of thing you don't need a hospital for. Secondly, there are no wards. Everyone has their own room. You get your own designated nurses that don't interact with other patients. The concept of a 'waiting list' is totally alien. I once explained to my consultant that 'i'd never get this done on the NHS, i'd be waiting for years' to which he replied with 'but you need it now, why would you have to wait?' - he honestly didn't understand, and thought i was taking the piss. 
Not everything is covered under the 'free' system here, but most things are. The whole french healthcare system is geared to be more efficient. You pay €40 a pop to see your GP but you have as much time as you like with him, and mine even speaks near-fluent english. The other thing is that pharmacies have proper pharmacists - for the sort of minor thing you'd go to your GP for, you can go to the pharmacy, and they can prescribe you things, too.
Finally, there's the mentality of the people that use the system. There's no real abuse of it. People use it as/when/if they need it - not because they get too drunk on a friday night and smack their head on a lamp-post, before proceeding to projectile vomit all over the waiting area and assaulting a nearby nurse.

Fuck dangerous dogs, seriously. I live in a rough inner city and lots of ""lads"" around here have pitbulls or other muscly, vicious dogs. People are terrified.

Once they get in the ""mode"", a muscly and vicious dog is a killing machine, nothing more and nothing less. It only finally let the smaller dog go when someone ripped off the dog's balls.

I am a big guy who is a good fighter, and I get scared at these dogs, so much so that I have practised quickly getting out the blade of my swiss army knife in case one of them charges me one day.

So not only do these dogs make people scared to go outside, not only are they a threat to human life, they also force law-abiding people like me to feel the need to carry around weaponry, because I no longer feel safe on the streets or in the park.

Often cited is the opinion that it isn't a TV friendly format, offering just one viewing angle. Others state that it isn't a sport which has 'super stars'. There is no Tiger Woods, Rafa Nadal or David Beckham of squash. 

In reality, i think it needs a major push to make it a commercially popular sport. The benefits of squash in fitness have never been questioned, and there are millions over the world that play it, far more than play handball for instance, yet handball is HUGE in Europe, and sell thousands of tickets. Squash just doesn't have that global commercial appeal. Yet.

The fact that squash requires enormous amounts of fitness, and if often deemed to be one of the most beneficial activities you can do, should give it hope of being an Olympic sport, but then you have pursuits such as archery, which requires tremendous concentration and skill, so it isn't all about fitness.

I don't think that golf or football, or rugby sevens, should be included ahead of squash though. Ironic really that the inclusion of squash may just be the boost that it needs to make it commercially successful. If handball takes off in a big way over in the UK and over the rest of the world, it may be a good sign for squash.

This is actually one of the most widely perpetuated ""troll advices"" of recent times.

If you even *attempt* to do this to a dangerous dog, it will rip out your neck (which you have conveniently exposed to it) and you will be dead within a few seconds.

It always amazes me how many people actually fell/fall for it. Step back and think for a second and try and comprehend the stupidity of the advice. If you *actually* think this would work, and actually try it on a dog that's intent on mauling you, then we have living proof of Darwinism at its finest.

No. Contrary to common sense, the best way to fight off a dog isn't to offer it your neck like a flabby roll of bacon. The best ways are more basic and gritty - attack it's eyes, break its snout (punching/kicking right on the nose), if you have anything sharp such as keys/pens, use them and go for the eyes/nose, or if possible attack it's genitals (grab, twist, pull, rake, squeeze, whatever you can do).

true,mansleg,eng-kent,Kent,"For supermarket workers the issue is of hours and not hourly pay. You are more likely to get a pay rise than improved contracted hours, which is what you really want.

Unfortunately, supermarkets require more people on lower hourly contracts. They prefer 3 people on 15 hour contracts than one person on a 45 hour contract so that if anyone calls in sick, it's a particularly busy day or there is a crisis, there is adequate cover. If the store is busy these 15 hour people will probably get 20-30 hours a week but when things are quiet are they will be left with the 15 and no more. 

Think about it: the store needs to use 150-200% the average weekly hours over Christmas and about 50% of that average for the first 2 weeks in January. The only way they can do this is keep contracted hours as low as possible and offer overtime when needed.

I work in a supermarket and recently got promoted to management. I'm on a salary, contracted 50 hours a week (5 x 10 hour shifts, but often end up doing more) but I am entitled to no overtime, bonus or otherwise - all  I receive is a yearly pay rise.

Before my promotion I was on a 30 hour contract. I could not pay all my bills, rent etc. doing 30 hours - I had to hit 35 minimum but ideally 40. I grafted, worked hard, acted professional, cosied up to management and always offered to do extra shifts and stay longer just to improve my monthly wage. Other staff are happy to do less hours but some, like me, are always working hard and asking for more but don't always receive. 

Anyway, just thought I should share my insight.

TL;DR - Supermarket staff care about hours worked, not hourly rate.

Simple solution is to charge the owner with whatever the dog does.

One mistake they made was to just give the ball to barca and invite pressure. They needed to keep possession as a 'rest' period better, but were too worried about conceding it in dangerous positions (as can be seen by the couple of times they did resulting in shots on goal).

For Chelsea, we need to be physical and play with a high tempo. We can score against them, even at Camp Nou, but must be drilled to play as a team. Counter attacking can be a strength and we can be successful using that tactic (if we have to play them) but defensive strength is key to begin with.

  Thankfully, we deal with a lot of tourists, since we get a ton of cruise vessels through here, and they always want photo's of the port that they berth at, they allowed us to 'use our discretion' when it comes to these things.  This has resulted in us not really having to worry about it so much, as, realistically, if someone actually wanted to target the port, they would just climb a hill and use a decent lens, or you know, google maps or something.  People taking photo's aren't really a security risk, unless they are focusing on a lot of things like the gatehouse, cameras, guards patrols, e.t.c.

This subreddit encourages everyone to have their input, and certainly is nowhere near being a nazi-mod-ruled subreddit, but sometimes the fact that it's so welcoming tends to mean that large events encourage floods of the same joke.

Please don't hate the mods, nobody's infallible and they have a tough time keeping the spammers at bay. Also keeping a large community in check is a bastard and a half, probability states that there is ALWAYS going to be someone with an issue with everything they do*, as far as communities go they've been pretty hands-off with this one, which is cool, and also leads to a larger lashing out when they actually impose any kind of new rule, ever.

\* To expand on this, although it's irrelevant, if there's a cause which is written well enough, a good witch hunt is unavoidable. It's human nature to suddenly gain some pride and lash back at the people who impose often well-meaning rules, simply because nobody enjoys being told what to do, also a ""fall from grace"" scenario attracts angry people like flies to honey. It takes one person, with one well-worded post to turn an intelligent community into a horde of shit-flinging apes if there's no other side to the story, therefore doing ANYTHING with your power as a mod is a gamble.

true,ghostridethewhip,null,null,"1. A speedy Right Forward/Left Forward who will get in behind Barca's LB/RB should the LB/RB not be in good position due to being in an advanced, attacking position. See Ronaldo v. Abidal/Alves yesterday. My suggestion would be Sturridge on one wing and a player like Malouda on the other. Any combination of two wingers with pure pace and who are strong on the ball. Mata can float around in the middle somewhere to create and link up when play slows down. I honestly do not think a lone striker has a chance against Puyol/Pique unless he is absolutely dominant a la Drogba from the Time of Ovrebo.

2. Strong midfielders who can pressure the shit out of the man on the ball in midfield. Lass Diarra was doing a fantastic job yesterday through most of the first half. I would start a midfield of Romeu (CDM), Essien and Ramires (some combo of CM and CAM). Sure, it sounds defensive, but Ramires/Essien have strong attacking characteristics in addition to being able to add pressure defensively. Also, it would sure as hell stop Barca from parading down the pitch like they tend to do.

3. Defense needs to be quick in addition to smart. If Real didn't do such a solid job of stepping up for Barca's balls over the top yesterday, the score would have been far uglier than it was. Bosingwa would never be able to start, and Ivanovic would be too slow. As crazy as it sounds, I would honestly lean towards Paulo Ferreira at RB. He's far more tactically sound than Bosingwa, and he can't possibly do worse than Altintop did yesterday (which I thought was fairly admirable, for an attacker at RB).

        Ferreira -- Luiz -- Terry -- Cole
    
           Ramires -- Romeu -- Essien
    
          Sturridge -- Mata -- Malouda

I agree that these are probably the most important points, but I'm not so sure that Torres would be useful against Barca. Benzema/Higuain were totally anonymous for most of yesterday's match (save for Benzema heading off the post, which I think was from a deadball situation). Real had zero chances down the middle or from what one would consider classic striker play, in the way that Torres/Drogba would typically affect the game.

Torres may be quick, but 1) he wouldnt be able to hold up the ball effectively against Puyol/Pique because he can't match their strength and 2) he wouldn't have a chance in the air.

1.) We don't hold the formation. With Mata's tendency to cut into the middle and Lampard's tendency to step up into the box, this leaves the left side of the pitch fairly open which gives them space to drive in (Time for a LW so we can move Mata centrally).  We also run into the situation where Ramires is making runs forward but no one else is, so we give up possession and then we are one player down when the opponents go on attack.

2.) Lack of concentration. It's pretty clear that we lose focus when they start pressing in the last 10 minutes. We just need to relax, keep possession and move the ball around into attacking positions.

3.) Pace. Several players on our team just don't have the fitness to run for the full 90 minutes when we play these tactics during the game.

4.) Tactical Changes. It seems to me, more often than not, if we are up with 10 minutes left we turn into a park-the-bus style of play.

Whereas Rory did not have that absolute faith in an abstract being/thing beyond his control. A position the minotaur could fulfil.

&gt;it's also been shown, several times, how he's very doubtful and mildly distrustful of Amy.

I entirely disagree with that - he doesn't distrust Amy, he has faith in her as his partner/soulmate. It would be pretty hopeless trying to create a convincing solid relationship if Rory genuinely distrusted Amy.

It's more that he doesn't have faith in himself. When they were trying to do that ridiculous love-triangle thing in Day of the Moon, it was implying that Rory didn't believe in himself in being the one Amy loved beyond all doubt.

In my opinion, that's why he begins his journey at that low point of faith in himself, so we can see over series 6 how his character develops. By the end, he's so beta he's alpha.",0,1327013092,null,0,false,0,c3io4ym,t3_onknc,t1_c3io4ym,t1_c3im30i,null,1428205722,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

* Hartnell: It is good era, tough not as good some people make it out to be, fact show is growing and new really shows. (Voted: Good)

* Troughton: One of the stronger eras, Troughton is really good Doctor, it is just shame a lot of stories from this era are missing. (Voted: Very Good)

* Pertwee: I like it, Pertwee is interesting Doctor and there is a lot of good stories and Master. Still, not really among my favorites, but fun era either way. (Voted: Good)

* T.Baker: Really fantastic era and Tom clearly enjoyed playing the Doctor, until the last two seasons, where it starts to seem he is bit tired of the role, but i can't blame him after such long run as The Doctor. (Voted: Very Good)

* Davison: My second favorite era and Doctor, a lot of things went right with this era and it ended with one of the best stories of the show, shame Davison didn't stay that long. (Voted: Excellent)

* C.Baker: This is where thing go downhill, good actor, bad decisions from showrunner and BBC. Stories were poor and Colin was treated poorly, despite all this, it had some really good stories. (Voted: Average)

* McCoy: And this is where it all went to hell, while there is sings of attempts to bring show back to it's former glory, poor choices for writers give us some of the worst stories and enemies in this shows history. McCoy was good Doctor tough and it is shame show went downhill during his era, i would enjoyed seeing more of him. (Voted: Poor)

* McGann: Really terrible movie, really good Doctor, shame Paul never got chance to do proper TV series. (Voted: Awful)

* Eccelston: My third favorite Doctor and it is bloody shame he never did more than one series. (Rule 1: You don't talk about The Slitheen) (Voted: Good)

* Tennant: I really want to love this era, really good Doctor, some brilliant stories like Blink and other stuff, but... RTD's Rose romance, constant overblown finales, overuse of Daleks and in my opinion worst regeneration story of the show really drag this era down. (Voted: Average) 

* Smith: My favorite Doctor and my favorite era. Everything feels so right. Smith plays childlike but overall rather dark Doctor really well, and while there is few bad things, like Curse of the Black Spot and rather rushed ending to River Song arc, it is just such lovely era. (Voted: Excellent)

Let me explain the timeline to you.

*1964-2002: there are 8 canon Doctors. (Hartnell to McGann)


*2003: Shalka comes out and there are 9 canon Doctors. (we add Grant)

*2004: The new series is officially announced and Grant's Doctor stops being canon (back down to 8)

*2005: New series started and we were back up to 9 canon Doctors (Hartnell to Eccleston) 

So between 1963 and 2011, 12 separate version of the Doctor have been canon.  But no more than 11 at any one time.

The jist of it is, that official reports say that everyone that perished that day, were dead by 3:15PM (and that no lives could have been saved after this point). Essentially all emergency/life saving aid was halted at that time, with 43 ambulances outside the stadium, and only one allowed in.

The investigation after the disaster did not consider anything that happened after 3:15PM because the coroner stated that everyone was dead or brain dead by then.

In the case of Kevin Williams, there are several witnesses that have never been interviewed, that can testify that he was alive after 3:15PM. One of these is the person who was with him when he died at 4PM.

Kevin's injuries were not consistent with being crushed to death, and the familiy believe they can prove that he could have been saved, had the proper help been given.

I recommend [reading this blog](http://thekop.liverpoolfc.tv/_My-most-important-blog-ever/blog/5710846/173471.html?), it tells the mother's story.

Specifically, Cameron is Moominpappa.

Moominpappa has been seen wearing a top hat (alarm bells ringing?). And, inside Moominpappa's hat is written, """"M.P. from your M.M."" David Cameron is an M.P.

Still not convinced? Wait till you hear this -

Wikipedia describes that Moominpappa is, ""Slightly aristocratic (Cameron's father-in-law is a Baron) and has bohemian leanings (lived in Notting Hill - likes Tracey Emin), and is inexplicably drawn to the sea (David would like to give the Queen a yacht).

In the first picture, you can see a Moomin with playful blonde hair. I suspect Boris Johnson is in this conspiracy somehow.

You don't.

It's only if you're using that TV to broadcast live tv, and even then it's easy just to ignore the Tv licensing people and get away with it. There's also an online form you can fill out which tells them you don't need a license, and they stop sending you letters about it.

You pay the licensing fee to ensure that the BBC doesn't have any advertisements, the money they lose is paid for by the TV licensing payer. It's better for them to have no adverts so that they can remain impartial. This means, for example, that Top Gear can slag off a BMW car as much as it wants, without BMW giving the BBC a quick call and reminding them of the amount of money they spend on advertisements. On the whole this does mean better telly.

It seems like you're equating dressing 'super-sexy', which i think you're using to mean 'revealing', with a woman who just wants to have sex? You're saying you're 'achieving something' if you have sex with a girl who is covered up, which I think means you're saying that having sex with a girl who isn't covered up isn't achieving anything, because it's easier to have sex with them?

AKA - If she dresses revealingly it means she wants to have sex, so having sex isn't achieving anything because she's easy.

Comments like this make me feel a little uneasy due to the whole slut-shaming thing which, in turn, contributes to rape culture. Things you hear like 'She got raped? What did she expect going out dressed like that? She was asking for it' etc.

I do feel sorry for you in some regards. You're wrong to have worked off the books but I suspect you felt like you didn't have much choice. You mention you have only been unemployed for the past 3 months, can't you try getting back into the same business?

Employment in this country is a mess. Genuine side question, how the HELL do you live on 212 a month? the gas and electric bill for my house is just under half that per month! Do you live on your own? How do most people get by in that kind of a situation?

I think the idea of the scheme is good but it is poorly implemented. According to that article half of people on the scheme leave benefits after successfully completing. For someone who has more time than me may I suggest submitting a Freedom of Information act request to the DWP for these figures!?

Anyway, good luck with future job hunting!

EDIT: Seems someone has already done one for the guidance behind the scheme http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/mandatory_work_activity_and_mand#incoming-237451

Thank you for your email regarding your concerns about Nadine Dorries sex education Bill which which would introduce abstinence-only education for girls.

&gt;There are number of Bills being read on 20 January and the Dorries Bill has **little chance of succeeding** as it is so far down the list of Bills due to be read. However, I do intend on being in the House tomorrow and** I will oppose this Bill** if it comes before the House.

I think the commenter might have been using hyperbole to deliberately suggest that the two crimes aren't at all similar and that the whole thing has been blown out of proportion.  Clearly he has been misunderstood.

You see he's not actually suggesting that pirating is as bad as rape.  Nobody would do that.  But what he is suggesting is that the people who claim that pirating is bad are causing huge extremes of reasoning such that it appears to be a crime akin with rape.  Effectively he has created a parody of the person who is outraged by pirating and taken it to the extreme.

A cynic would say it is done to reduce the number of jobless temporarily to make things look better than they actually are, either way it is keeping people in debt slavery and the jobs that are actually there to be done are being satisfied in this manner effectively making them non-jobs, because the people doing them rarely get a foot on the ladder and find themselves back to square one after 3-4 weeks.

It would be interesting to hear from people who have been let go after the 4 weeks being re-hired by the agency for the same company, but I bet they are cleverer than to allow that to ever happen.

The one key thing you are missing though, is that instead of the person just sitting on his ass doing nothing, he is producing valuable work. And as you've stated, it's the same taxpayer money as previously, just routed in a different direction.

For me, this is not about ""slave labour"" or whatever emotive term you wish to use ... it's about getting rid of this entitlement culture that states if you have no work, you get money from the government to sit and do nothing. It is a benefit, NOT a right.

And if the government decree you have to actually get up off your ass and actually WORK for your benefits, then so be it.

It is the SAME 212 pounds that would have been given to the recipient anyway, but now instead of him sitting on a sofa, he's actually working for it.

I still cannot see a problem from that respect.

In terms of companies abusing the system for a source of ""cheap"" labour, then that's simply remedied. The company MUST employ some percentage (75% or higher) of people enrolled on this scheme, otherwise they cannot participate in it any longer.

The fact is Labour would be cutting 1% less per year off the budget. That is quite a large number of jobs that are still being kept with subsequent money spent on retail and service supporting even more jobs.

People pretending there isn't a real difference are not paying attention. Keynes doesn't say ""don't cut"". It says cut when the economy is doing well. We can't afford to follow this precisely but that doesn't mean any old cuts are now good.

The closest we can follow to ideal is to cut in the slowest manner that is reasonably possible. That is the gap between the Tories and Labour. Neither plan will leave us in trouble with interest rates. The Labour plan would stimulate growth more. In hindsight it has turned out that the market doesn't actually care about the CRAs at all which is what I expected when people were talking about a potential downgrade. Few important actors depend upon the CRAs. They exist to give the public the illusion that there is regulation.

Regardless most of the big authorities that Osborne cited now disagree with him. The IMF have begged the Tories to reconsider and even the CBI have said maybe it is time for plan B. If consensus wasn't against the Tories before it is now.

The most damning thing of all though is the Tories own admission. When they came to power they said quite reasonably that growth is more important than debt. They also said that austerity will inspire growth. The latter hasn't happened and growth has stalled in the face of austerity.

true,captain_ramshackle,uk,Kingston Upon Thames,"Even as a programmer I'm not even sure I know the best way of starting.

There seem to be two distinct ideas

* Spend time learning the basics and be quite close to how the computers works, learn algorithms and implement them

* Find a high level language that lets you get a lot done quickly.

I learned to program by writing in BASIC and then assembly before moving to Pascal, Java, COBOL, C#, Python and they all (apart from COBOL) have a special place in my heart.

My suggestion is probably going to have a lot of disagreement for two reasons

* It's very Microsoft

* It jumps straight into a big language

* It skips learning how a computer really works and allows you not to have to learn how to implement a doubly linked list etc.

I think you should download Visual Studio Express (which is free from Microsoft) and learn C#.

Why?

* Because Visual Studio is brilliant, it makes programming a lot easier by having auto completion and a very easy to use debugger.

* Because C# is well thought out and easy to write something useful in but forces you to be a bit more pre-thinking than Python (statically vs. dynamically typed).

* Because there are many good books

* Because when you're more advanced it's easy to move it into other areas like XBOX programming or ASP.Net for web development.

* Because Windows Presentation Foundation make applications with a good UI easy to do compared to Python


Why Not?

* You're into the Microsoft camp

* It's just not as cool as learning Python.

Why Not C or C++?

* Because they're great for special cases but for learning and general application programming they're just not as easy as managed code.

Just to start displaying data you have to learn HTML and CSS and potentially JavaScript. Then for most meaningful web applications you then need to learn a programming language for the backend and probably SQL for the database.

That's a huge amount to learn considering that they're starting off from a low level.

At what point are they meant to be learning basic data structures, control flow logic and sound design? Before or after they've learned to use the rest of the stack?

Starting with a simple command line program which accepts input and generates output gives new people a chance to learn the basics.

You could easily spend a month just learning SQL to a sufficient standard to be able to create a well designed database and sensible queries for it. You're then proposing someone with zero programming experience would then start writing an application to interface with it?

I think web development is a nice area to work in once you've got a bit of programming experience as it looks all flashy and can let you put stuff together quite quickly, but you can do that with a WPF based system as well.

true,OptioMkIX,null,null,"&gt;The one key thing you are missing though, is that instead of the person just sitting on his ass doing nothing, he is producing valuable work. And as you've stated, it's the same taxpayer money as previously, just routed in a different direction.

&gt;For me, this is not about ""slave labour"" or whatever emotive term you wish to use ... it's about getting rid of this entitlement culture that states if you have no work, you get money from the government to sit and do nothing. It is a benefit, NOT a right.

&gt;And if the government decree you have to actually get up off your ass and actually WORK for your benefits, then so be it.

&gt;It is the SAME 212 pounds that would have been given to the recipient anyway, but now instead of him sitting on a sofa, he's actually working for it.

You seem to be missing the point that the person is producing valuable work for a *private* entity while effectively getting paid by *the state*.

Lets say that I'm a company that makes some small device, a widget. I could get a machine to do a certain operation on the part or its more cost effective for me to employ a man to do it. The government comes to me and says that they will provide me an employee, but the government will pay their wages. All I have to do is agree on paper to give each worker at the end of their tenure a reference or if they make the grade (In a manner to be determined by me) to offer them a job.

So in one fell stroke, I have:

- Increased productivity.
- Lowered my costs of production, increasing my profit margin.

In return I have to:

- Shell out a neglible cost in providing a reference (either answering a phone call at some point in the future or a minimal expense in paper and ink).

- Maybe, sortof, possibly employ someone if I like the look of them enough. In practice any man in the land can do this job since its a very simple operation, so theres nothing to really distinguish candidates that really add value to my operation at this price point (free wages).

As most people should be aware, labour costs are often the largest within a business.With these increased profits, I can look to open a new factory producing more widgets. The government comes to me again and says that they have some more workers for me, and they will also pay those guys wages. The same applies. 

I reiterate to you, *why should the state give a source of free labour to private companies when these workers could, and should be getting paid in proportion to the increase in productivity that they provide?*

Purely so they have something to do? You speak about ""entitlement culture"" and yes, there are some ( a very few! ) who game the system for all its worth. I would have no problem if people were made to accept work at a voluntary organisation, or a charity (like museums, citizens advice bureau, whatever), **but effectively paying them to work at a rate significantly below the legally mandated wage is the very definition of worker exploitation.** To then hold the stick over their heads of being cut off from benefits if they dont agree is certainly coercion added into the mix.

&gt;In terms of companies abusing the system for a source of ""cheap"" labour, then that's simply remedied. The company MUST employ some percentage (75% or higher) of people enrolled on this scheme, otherwise they cannot participate in it any longer.

&gt;I don't know why this isn't already part of the terms &amp; conditions of the scheme ? IN fact, it probably is, but one guys anecdotal evidence on Reddit is worth far more than the reality that many people seem to be finding this a useful stepping stone to getting OFF the dole, and into meaningful employment.

Jesus christ man you have your head stuck in the sand. I suggest you start here to see that this is not just one mans anecdote.

The Doctor makes some passing remark about thinking he'd parked further on, he tries his key - and it doesn't work.  Snaps fingers?  Doesn't work.  Suddenly - GUNFIRE.  BIG FRAKING GUNFIRE.  Perhaps with the sound of a distressed DALEK underneath the gunfire.  Then silence - and Ace walks around the bend, holding a BFG and the head of a DALEK.

A beat...

&gt; Ace: WHO THE HELL ARE YOU AND WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING WITH MY TARDIS??!? &lt;levels gun at him/&gt;

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","You might want to look at the [Criminal Law Act 1977 Part II](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/45/part/II). This is currently the defining law around squatting in the UK; put roughly, once a court says you're out, you must leave.

We have two eviction processes for dealing with squatters; a fast process, which can be stopped if the squatter can show that the owner knew of their presence more than 28 days before process started, and the general eviction process (also used against things like legal tenants who've stopped paying rent). The fast process is quick - you can get a squatter out in under a month. The slow process takes months, as it intends to protect people against being made homeless.

If it's a residential property, there are extra rights to evict a squatter in favour of someone who is intending to live there, either as owner-occupier, or as a legal tenant of the owner.

Finally, we have the adverse possession laws - if I can provably squat for 10 years, *and* you don't respond when the Land Registry tells you I've asked to take ownership of the property, I get to own it. This is effectively a barrier against absentee owners holding onto land indefinitely - you must check on it every few years to keep it.",0,1327082748,null,0,false,0,c3iwwav,t3_op0qj,t1_c3iwwav,t1_c3iwfnv,null,1428209905,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

In that context I can see why people are pointing fingers at our deal, but their deal looks a little odd to me.  I struggle with the idea that adidas (one of the most established kit manufacturers in football) couldn't make their $19.8M deal with Liverpool profitable, so it surprises me that a company with no experience in football would risk a $41.3M deal on a team that is looking likely to fall short of qualification to the Champions League.
If they're in it to make immediate profit, I think the numbers are outrageous; if they're in it to make a name for themselves in football, then surely they would want a team that is in the Champions League.

Our deal involves much bigger figures so I think it's easier to point fingers at our deal, but to pretend that Liverpool's deal represents nothing more than shrewd business seems a little naive to me.
