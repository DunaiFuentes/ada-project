Scotland receives more than England on a per capita basis. I agree. London receives more per capita than Scotland. Now we don't hear demands for Boris to hand back his subsidy do we. We don't hear Londoners called subsidy junkies. Wonder why?

Barnett is just one part of government expenditure however. To get the total picture you need to consider the entirety of government expenditure and also the other side of the equation - taxes raised. There is only one publication that allows you to do this and that is the annual Government Expenditure and Revenues Survey or [GERS](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Economy/GERS).

That makes it hard to throw a 17-19 year old into a match with the pressure of having to score just to earn the club points, rather than just taking a chance to shine with the first time.  Lastly.  The generation coming through the Academy/Reserves right now are mostly 19 and younger.  Apart from Arsenal and Barcelona you generally don't see meaningful appearances/contribution until the players are 20-21.  Martin Kelly and Jay Spearing are good examples of that.  What John Flanagan did last season, and to an extent Jack Robinson, is pretty rare.  In some cases, these players might be playing in their final position.  Martin Kelly has always been a centre half and Conor Coady has always been talked about in the same capacity.  By next year or the end of this season we will have seen a couple appearances from the older group in the reserves: Conor Coady, Toni Silva, Kristian Adorjan, etc.",0,1326336891,null,0,false,0,c3gbx8a,t3_ocy6t,t1_c3gbx8a,t3_ocy6t,null,1428165129,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

Also I think the SNP have misjudged the oil situation... It's dwindling in reserves and from what I can ascertain requires specialist equipment to get the remaining drops.... Chances are they will end up doing business with BP or Shell who pay tax.... in London.

There is also the question of existing contracts for oil producers which would need resolution if the scottish gov were to want to claim 90% of revenue from the oil fields. I can't imagine a situation where any oil company would settle for such a small percentage of profit in exchange for doing ALL of the heavy lifting...

Good luck to them if they want to go for it. I wouldn't stand in their way if I were Cameron.

Their prosperity projections seem to be based upon little more than national pride and a desire for self determination. It's hard to argue against those sentiments regardless of 'figures' and 'numbers'.

I say let them have their freedom, and the 'oil', we keep their banks with all of its debt and make sure we stay good friends.

If it is true that other similar sized ethnic groups have a higher propensity to lobby for their interests then it would be factually correct to say that Chinese people tend to get on with it, it would not be racist.

Certainly ""black issues"" are in the news far more often than Chinese issues and I don't think anyone would dispute that.  However there's [several times more black people in the U](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_the_United_Kingdom#2001_Census_ethnicity_results)K than there are Chinese people.

Depending on what you term an ethnic minority to be (you may consider all white people not to be, for example), then between 3% and 5% of ethnic minorities are Chinese, while it's five times that figure for black, and slightly more for south Asian (if you choose to group them together). I'd guess from those figures that there's around as many Muslims as there are black people, which probably goes some ways to show that the two biggest non-white race/cultural issues to appear in the news are black people and Muslims.

I say let Scotland make its choice. It's a country which has produced some of he greatest minds of our collective history. I'm sure Scotland will be alright. I am completely in favour of Scotland maintaining principl control of the oil and us maintaining control the Scottish banks and their subsequent losses. 

Fact is, the debt is shit for now but RBS is an unbelievably huge and previously successful bank before its ill fated decision to buy a tanker ship of toxic waste re ABN. RBS was actually used by Harvard business school as a model of a successful banking organisation. One terrible decision, prominently backed by Mr Salmond, fucked it all up.

Now the UK (English) Gov/taxpayer owns this asset rich, cash poor powerhouse and we bought it for pennies on the pound. We are just starting the J Curve.

Personally... I think that Salmond is a dodgy geezer. He strikes me as being a bit strange and shall we say 'uninformed' and blinkered which can be seen in the ABN example. I feel this is an awful time for scots to divorce and excellent for the English.

On London, I never mentioned subsidy in relation to London. I merely pointed out that, on a per capita basis, their share of English identifiable expenditure is greater than Scotland's identifiable expenditure. This is not a subsidy - just government expenditure. I went on to say;

&gt;Now we don't hear demands for Boris to hand back his subsidy do we. We don't hear Londoners called subsidy junkies.

Because nobody thinks of government expenditure in London as a subsidy - just up here in Scotland. But to be clear I wasn't calling it a subsidy.

&gt;If Scotland wants independence then I say go for it. No grudges, no annimosity and no closed doors. When something like self determination and independance becomes a primary driver of discussion, economic arguments don't really matter

It isn't all about pride or economics, it also about better governance. It is about having all the tools at your disposal. It is about being able to tackle problems, like controlling powerful airguns (which the Home Office had no interest in helping out with legislation) or our drink problem, without having to wait until it becomes part of Westminster's agenda  - which is usually never.

Maybe it is justified, and the rest of us deserve to be endebted for decades as a means of partially paying off banking losses from the utterly irresponsible Scottish banking institutions who were grossly incompetantly regulated by the two last PMs who were both Scottish who also racked up public debt to near national bankruptcy levels. 

If I was being the evil English arsehole whom you appear to be wishing to argue with I might say something like that. 

However I'm not. Just merely reading between the lines and obliging.

Secondly, the oil if we're going to define what is and isn't our's as every other country does in the world, and as the UK is currently doing in the Falklands and Sandwich Islands - is ours.

Thirdly, he isn't asking for lost oil revenue back.

Fourthly, the case to be made that Westminster's poor banking regulation, like the rest of the world's shitty regulation caused the crisis and it should be them that picks up the bill does have a point.

Finally, he's a politician, and I'm the first to say Salmond's a cheeky wee bastard sometimes. This is one of those times. He's going to try and get as best a deal as he can for Scotland and then negotiate downward in the end resulting in a better deal anyway. Don't get your panties in a twist lads, we'll no doubt be taking our fair share of the debt because like you - we're all middle and working class and that's exactly who gets fucked by big banking losses.

Well no. Scotland should probably end up paying about 15% of United Kingdom's debt (in accordance with the GDP lineup).

The SNP is committed to getting rid of trident bases in scotland so the base and all its supporting infrastructure would close and be relocated to England or Wales. Similarly its likely that the shipyards currently building the aircraft carriers would face some tough times - its likely that the projects would be finished in place rather than starting again, but it would present a bleak future for the workers there unless the Scottish government decide they want a navy.

Public sector job losses north of the border would likely be quite high as services migrate back to the (new) UK, same with the financial sector. Obviously this all depends entirely on circumstances such as the legislative approach taken by the new Scottish government on things such as taxation policy.

A newly independant Scotland would also have some overheads - creating embassies, negotiating treaties and so on. The paperwork will probably take a few years to square away properly.

Obviously the rest of the UK will have to take a severe reduction in oil revenues which the Scottish are banking on for immediate cash, the question of if that loss would be offset by reduced spending in Scotland on things like rail, road and utility expenditure, public services etc will probably not be answered until a decade after the split.

Best case is that both countries manage to grow and pursue their own way of living, its likely to be a very interesting experiment in Labour verses Conservative policy. Worst case scenario is that Scotland crumbles under the weight of its own spending or enacts massive austerity measures, but I dont think that the worst case of the UK is anything more than a slight stumble.",0,1326355652,null,0,false,0,c3gensf,t3_od2ex,t1_c3gensf,t3_od2ex,null,1428166420,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Wild camping is also unofficially ""allowed"" in the Lake District as long as you are above the highest farmers boundary and out of sight. In other national parks people regularly get away with it by just being discrete.

Depending on which statistics you look at, unemployment is 0.2% higher in Scotland than the rest of the UK as an average - not a terribly relevant statistical difference - and the growth forecast for the country is slightly higher. The NHS in Scotland is already independent and manages its budget perfectly well, despite the sick man of Europe tag.

And there is no net loss on Scotland - it more than pays its own way within the union. The myth that it's subsidised is just that. London is subsidised by the rest of the UK to a greater degree than is Scotland. This Fact Check article from Channel 4 in 2006 provides more information: http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/world/do+the+scots+subsidise+the+english/166260.html

At best, the case is not proven - but your figure of £12bn is just stuff and nonsense.

I agree that if this happens, it'll be a messy and convoluted separation, but a little realism is required. Scotland is perfectly capable of operating as an independent state - economists have lined up to endorse the view - and policies such as free university tuition, free prescriptions, and free care for the elderly, are perfectly possible if that's what you choose to spend your money on.

None of the UK government parties campaigned on a platform of (expressed) unionism yet they were still elected, so the population in the rest of the UK has to trust their elected representatives to get the best deal.

In large part, this is a complete failing of the UK parties to engage and convince Scottish voters of the merits of the UK.

Right now, they do the sums, and discover that it's (note made up numbers) £10,000 if they lose in court, £1,000 to fight which can be claimed back if they win definitively enough, 50/50 chance of winning due to lack of case law, 90/10 chance of having to pay their own costs. They then say that their average cost of fighting is £900 (90% chance of paying their own costs, 10% chance of making the claimant pay), the average payout if they lose is expected to be £5,000, so claims below £5,450 are worth paying out without fighting.

The ambulance chasers are aware that they do these calculations, and claim enough less than the amount the insurers will pay out that it's a ""pay out without a fight - cheaper to settle than to argue"" situation.

If insurers weren't so predictable (e.g. they randomised the amount they'd pay to get rid of a claim, and would sometimes fight on a case they were almost certain they'd lose), the problem would fade away - most whiplash cases are hard to prove, and the ambulance chasers would find themselves losing lots on a regular basis. Using the made up numbers above, they would fight claims below £1,000 10% of the time, and claims below £10,000 50% of the time, demanding compensation from the lawyers of the claimant if they withdraw the claim (to prevent ambulance chasers just withdrawing claims if they find that the insurers fight).

There's an International Convention which establishes what seabed belongs to whom.  It works along coastline and geological formation expanding under the water.  That's the precedent.

The idea that England has claim to the Irish Sea and the Falklands so Scotland should get the North Sea in a game of dibs is childish.  You look at International Convention and establish the maritime border for negotiation from there.  What someone has on another coast or in an overseas territory doesn't come into it.
 
&gt;So if we're using those rules to gain oil reserves in the Antartic then we can't say they don't count for Scottish claims.

Careful what you're arguing because it sounds like might makes right and that it is justifiable just to take.  If Scotland goes down the independence path the United Kingdom doesn't stop being, the UK Treasury still continues.  In a hypothetical might makes right and 'those that take-get' scenario, Scotland doesn't have a navy.  It's preposterous to even go down this route of discussion because it is only down to International Convention and negotiation, but if you want to say that if Britain can take the Falklands, however historically erroneous that idea is since Britain had populated the Falklands even before Argentina had been formed, and that then Scotland can seize the North Sea for themselves you're making an argument that the UK should take all of the North Sea oil because they most definitely will have the might and the navy. 

I have absolutely no doubt that if Scotland does go down the independence route that it will eventually make it work, and even in independence it makes no sense for the UK to see a failing Scotland, so it will work although I have equal no doubt in that there'll be considerably more birthing pains than what most people expect.  I agree with your sentiment of opening up new industries, and I'm sure an independent Scotland would rise to the challenge.

The reason [UK] premiums keep increasing is partly down to that (referral fees, claims, etc) but you also have to look at the larger market-place. Insurers have to keep the pot of money some place, and given global uncertainty they have moved it to lower-risk-lower-return pots. This means to keep increasing corporate profits the insurers have to take a larger piece of the pie.    

Insurance is also much less competitive than it used to be. While there are many companies which are consumer facing, many of them re-sell the policy to only a handful of larger insurers who in turn actually pay out/set fees. Many of the smaller insurers are just management companies.    

Lastly, no-claims-bonuses are completely out of control in the UK. While in other countries you might see a discount for no claims in the last few years, UK based insurance companies are now literally tracking no-claims in some cases for tens of years, simply because they can (since insurance was a legal mandate longer than most other countries).    

This ultimately results in a system which doesn't ""spread the risk"" at all, with much older people paying sometimes as little as £100, while those without no-claims can pay upwards of £4000+ for their first few years of cover.    

This is a system set to implode at some stage, but unfortunately we're still stuck in a bubble and controlling/limiting no-claims-bonuses isn't even on the radar for government or consumer groups.

As far as taking the North Sea by force goes, a decent chunk of the British armed forces are Scots and...really I don't think anyone would risk what surmounts to civil war, not to mention England would destroy its reputation in Europe, and the world. Going after the under dog is a bad idea in this day and age.

I can see them sorting out some sort of deal with regards to the armed forces as well. The UK will keep the bulk but a defence force would be ceded to Scotland no doubt.

The United Kingdom would cease to exist technically, seeing as the United Kingdom was the two kingdoms of Scotland and England. Great Britain is the bit with all the bells and whistles like Ulster.

It's pretty basic, there's a gas cooker but no electricity or running water. You'll need to take candles and drinking water, although there's rain water for washing with.

Here's a few photos from when I was there in April last year...

The watch house was formerly owned by the Girl Guides association and is now run by a charitable trust who are responsible for managing the place.

AFAIK they charge £175 for a four day stay for up to eight people.  
Personally I'd recommend no more than six though else two will end up sleeping in the [watch tower](http://www.billallsopp.co.uk/imgs/gallery/14714/14714_927499564cf131f27406e.jpg) (the upstairs bit which overlooks the sea), which is only accessible via a [rickety metal ladder](http://i.imgur.com/Fh5NT.jpg).  

I'd also recommend taking a blow up mattress, as the camp beds provided aren't the most comfortable things in the world.

I'm really a skiing &amp; action sports kind of person, so wouldn't normally have gone for a holiday like this. Somehow though I ended up really enjoying leaving civilization behind for a few days, even if we did cheat a bit and hike to the pub for a meal and a few sneaky pints one evening.

As it's so cheap we've already booked again for this year, although not in April again as it was a bit windy on a couple of the days last time.

- Johnson is coming in from the side, with some good clearance to the player. Kompany is coming in from dead on up front. 

Cons vs. Kompany's tackle:

- Johnson is fucking airborne with both legs out. Komany doesn't even have room to get his studs up, because by the time his feet leaves the ground, he has already plowed through Nani.

Is Kompany's tackle ""reckless""? Maybe. He's definitely going in like a freight train with some heavy momentum.  
Is Johnson's tackle ""reckless""? Maybe. He's tackling the ball away from the player. But he is still perfectly unable to control himself should anything go wrong.  
Both are unfortunately and indeniably direct reds under today's rules. 

Whether or not pussyfooting like that is a good thing or not, is another discussion. I think it's shite, because refs are too card-happy when it comes to tackles. You need at least half a pitch worth of clearance if you even want to consider sliding in on a ball these days, otherwise you will face a yellow it seems. 

I can see how injuries like those of Eduardo, who had his leg snapped clean in half by a tackle like this, would give reason to scream and shout about reckless tackles. It still takes away a lot from the defenders, who have to be caweful not to invuwe the poow widdle stwikews. 

It also works a bit like protective gear in american football. A man who would jump away from a tackle in the past, will now rather benefit from taking the tackle, or even seeking it out, in order to have the opposition play the rest of the game one man down.

There's a good reason why Matthew Vaughn didn't care for the UKFC, and went to Hollywood for funding and help instead.

The Kings Speech was a good swansong for the UKFC, but that was a lucky strike. It generated income yes, however there are more pressing things that it could've worked towards. 

Most countries film institutions exist to: 
a) encourage employment of that nations film making skills. 
b) enable funding for productions that want to work in that nation
c) increase the cultural impact of that nation

UKFC occasionally helped fund the odd gritty gangster style film, or the banal and depressing social realism films, or period drama. Many of these films had middling earning potential at best, and nor were they particularly great and rememorable. They did throw a few hundred grand at the occasional great, but they absolutely could've done more then they did. Because honestly, they never helped independent filmmakers before. Cameroon is merely suggesting the BFI now funds and helps movies with large audience appeal. Something I'm all for, because tent-pole movies enable companies to take more risks with small films, this could help independents far more than the UKFC ever did.

Cameroon's suggestion isn't perfect, but it's a change and an upheaval, which was direly needed, lest the industry stale up.

We are returning to a similar environment and if you look at things like Prince giving away his album for free in the Daily Mail then you can see the way things are going. 

The answer for the record companies is to just do what netflix have done and provide a better product that undermines the reasons to pirate. But fuck the record companies anyway, they've done more to damage music and rip off artists than any pirate could ever do.

I have a bit of a thing about ""compensation"" of people in crashes.  To me it seems totally corrupt.  The tax payer picks up the bill for actual injures through the NHS and benefits and 100 other little ways but any ""compensation"" goes to the person who got into the car, knowing there might or might not be an accident and what the outcome might be?  Most likely they have made no contribution towards the costs of the journey (petrol and insurance being the 2 big ones) but they are quite happy to cry ""where is mine then?"" when it comes out badly.

My friend was rear ended recently.  He is a very moral person and when the other drivers insurance company rang him to talk about it he made clear he was not hurt in any way.  They offered him £2k in compensation.  When he said he did not feel he should be compensated since he was not injured they kept telling him to just take it.  After the 5th phone call he agreed to accept 2k as a ""gift"" in exchange for signing to say he was not injured in any way.

That is why both his and my car insurance is soo high, because chumps lie to get compensation that they would not *need* even if they were injured.  Insurance companies pay out because going to court is too expensive.  And the costs all get passed to innocent motorists weighted in such a way as to penalise the young and male.

The whole racket of car insurance in the UK is bad enough but adding a payout lottery to it just makes it worse.

Edit:  Of course he will not be asked to pay any tax or NI on the ""compensation"" while we both have to pay income tax, NI, capital gains and 100 other things on money we earn either by working or saving and being frugal...

true,Rotgrub,null,null,"&gt;As far as taking the North Sea by force goes, a decent chunk of the British armed forces are Scots and...really I don't think anyone would risk what surmounts to civil war, not to mention England would destroy its reputation in Europe, and the world. Going after the under dog is a bad idea in this day and age.

It seems little point continuing a never to happen hypothetical other than to illustrate how irrelevant the Falkland precedent is to this.  What I will say is that the UK forces do not belong to the English, the Welsh, the Northern Irish or the Scottish - they're UK and the UK will still exist if Scotland leaves only in a different form.  There is no tallying up if Scotland no longer wishes to be part of the UK in that regard, especially since Salmond has already disavowed the the submarine bases and the national debt.  Even if in a case of perfect altruism the remaining UK were to gift Scotland a portion of the navy in accordance to Salmond's own proportions Scotland's still only getting between 8 to 15%.  That's where Scotland stands on this.

&gt;I can see them sorting out some sort of deal with regards to the armed forces as well. The UK will keep the bulk but a defence force would be ceded to Scotland no doubt.

I suspect a common defence policy would be quickly written up with annual defence contributions along current similar lines...which if you think about it makes independence look even less like independence when you also consider Scotland staying in the pound, or pegged to the pound, with the Bank of England calling interest, if not issue, and the remaining UK treasury effectively owning the Scottish banks.

It is worth mentioning however that military heads and former Chiefs of General Staff for the armed forces have described a common defence policy with an independent Scotland as 'unsustainable' on the grounds of incongruent foreign policy.  [Even Salmond doesn't contest where the British military will end up.](http://www.rusi.org/analysis/commentary/ref:C4DF0A2F39DAA2/)

&gt;The United Kingdom would cease to exist technically, seeing as the United Kingdom was the two kingdoms of Scotland and England. Great Britain is the bit with all the bells and whistles like Ulster.

No it wouldn't, the UK was set up as a separate entity in its own right in the Acts of Union, all the laws written in the last 300 hundred years under the UK would still apply, all the institutions would still exist, to those not opting out.  In a very much technical and real way the laws of the Union would still apply to those not seeking, voting or passing independence from it.  The Act of Union created a legal entity distinct from both England and Scotland.  It wasn't just a union it formed a single entity, a country of itself.  If any other part of a country decides to secede, the country it breaks away from doesn't stop existing.

There's precedent with this  The 1800 act formed one kingdom too - when part seceded the remainder didn't rewrite or revoke the act.  It stood.

Clearest illustration? We've crossed the ball more than any other team in the Prem (592; almost 70 more crosses than the next best Man U) but have one of the poorest accuracies (20%). And even of that 20%, how many of them are low and drilled into the box, and how many are properly flighted for Carroll's head?

[Stats from: http://www.anfieldindex.com/5033/liverpool-midterm-statistical-report.html]

The interesting thing about Carroll is that he thrives on crosses from deep, almost at time diagonally from central midfield (see: the Meireles cross for that Man City goal last season, Gerrard's crosses against Newcastle). Nobody has given him that this season - at Newcastle he had Joey Barton doing it perfectly.

Some people would blame Downing for this, but for me Downing's job is to get to the byline and deliver from there (granted, he's not doing that fantastically either). Instead, I'd look at better floated delivery from Johnson &amp; Enrique from deeper positions, and/or balls from Henderson, Adam (and now Gerrard, who's shown how it's done).

Note: All of this does require Carroll's positioning to be spot on, and it isn't always.

true,Rotgrub,null,null,"&gt;Yeah that'd be fair, all Scotland would really need is a defence force like Norway. 

The discussion is moving towards the Republic of Ireland model and allowing Scots who want to be part of a bigger force being allowed to join British forces south of the border.  Salmond has said he is not opposed in principle to UK forces being stationed in Scotland, but he's made it clear that they wouldn't be considered Scottish forces.  The UK has equally speculated that it would be disastrous for most Scottish regiments.  In principle that might not be a bad thing if they're not needed, in practice it will mean a lot of out of work soldiers.

&gt;I think the currency side of things is out of necessity right now. The Euro is on its arse.

I agree, only I feel it is going to create even more antagonism.  I've no problem with Scotland pegging a currency to the pound - but now you'd have an independent country with no control its own interest rates, and in the birthing pains I don't think the two countries are going to meet the same economic demands.  I can see the remainder being in a position to raise its interests rates before Scotland is ready as independence is going to bring a lot of set up costs.  Increasing rates to suit the South, which they'll have to do when it is right, will hurt Scotland terribly if it's not ready.

That's going to make independence look like serfdom, and England will undoubtedly be blamed by the people - but the decision won't be theirs but market driven.

&gt;Yeah, the laws etc. would still exist, but in a different form. Scots law and English law exist as seperate entities anyway.

But importantly the legal entity of the United Kingdom would still exist.  The Union is much more than a union, an agreement.  It created a new entity and that doesn't stop being because one partner pulls out.  The marriage analogy doesn't fit here.  Literally a separate entity was created when the union was made - that doesn't happen in civil partnership.

Actually, the fact that you interpreted my statement like that indicates your class prejudices, not mine. I worked in Poundland for a while, and it's not somewhere you're likely to pick up valuable skills. As a work placement, it's value is for the experience of going to work and dealing with other people in a work environment... that's it. Hence, it's value as far as experience goes is limited. If they're not going to pay, and you've already held down a job before, it's value as far as experience is near zero. If they're not going to pay, then whatever class you are, there's no value to going there.

&gt; I agree that it would be wrong if this is used purely as exploitation rather than to offer an evaluation period that could lead to a permanent job offer. 

It wouldn't be a big deal for them to just hire people, and if they don't work out then they can let them go within the first few weeks. They're absolutely the last place that needs several weeks of a trial period before they work out whether you're worth paying.

Vulnerable people, I think, will be less apt to stand up to an aggressive sales pitch in the street, door or supermarket checkout. It's way different in person. 

When I worked for the door to doors, wealthier areas would generally sign up way less often than council estates or places with more old folks. Is it because they're already giving a monthly donation to some organisation or is it because they find it easier to say no? The reason they solicit monthly donations not a single one of say £50 is because they know most people will forget about it or notice it leaving. It's all psychology, and I'm not saying these charities aren't doing good, because they most likely are, but the whole thing is a big grey area in my books.

So for them: arm and hand strength &gt; the pull of the void doorway for someone with a small amount of void stuff

The TARDIS is a pretty heavy piece of machinery. Exactly how heavy it is seems to vary. In a classic episode it was stated to weigh 5 × 10^6 kilograms, but in the modern episode 'Blink' it was apparently light enough for police officers to move it to their station.

Even on the lighter end of that range though, it seems very unlikely that it would be light enough for a single person to be able to lift.

Therefore: Weight of TARDIS &gt; a single person's arm and hand strength &gt; the pull of the void door for someone or something with a small amount of void stuff

So the TARDIS was just too heavy to be pulled in.

A lot of people now on unemployment have paid their taxes to be able to claim unemployment benefits at a later date as part of their job. They are not taking other people's taxes, they are using what they have paid into and have been required to pay into by law.

But, you want to know what the real problem is?

Throughout the world there are *more people* and *less work* - and that is a simple fact of economics and technological progress. A world based on work as a primary means of support is simply no longer viable, and an economy based on consumption is no longer viable because of this.

Take companies like Foxconn who are looking to re-tool their factories with automated systems rather than submit to the demands of western companies who are concerned about their treatment of workers. It's cheaper.

The solution is simple - we accept automation and accelerate it and, in response, we set up a resource allocation system and bypass the monetary system entirely (essentially, a technocratic form of communism).

EPL Stoke (H): If we can get over our inability to beat teams at home then this is a sure fire winnable game.

EPL Bolton (A): Bolton have been so poor this season, we should be destroying them here.

CC Man City (H): Tough but given the one goal lead into the 2nd leg we could get something out of this.

FA Man Utd (H): I don't expect us to win this but a win is a real bonus. Preferably not a draw though, I would rather lose than waste time going to Old Trafford to probably lose anyway!

EPL Wolves (A): Should win this away to a poor side.

EPL Spurs (H): In my opinion, this is the toughest game in this run. Spurs have been so good recently and have the ability to destroy anyone. If we're on form we can get something out of this.

EPL Man Utd (A): Don't expect anything out of this, anything is a bonus.

EPL Everton (H): They have been pretty poor this season in general, this should be a win.

EPL Arsenal (H): Tough game, would be happy with a draw but we could win this. They won't have Henry by then so might be on a downer.


Overall in the Premier League we should be getting 4 definite wins against Stoke, Bolton, Wolves and Everton. A few points from the games against Spurs, United and Arsenal and thats a good haul from a tough run. Most of the tougher games are at home so we have an advantage there.

&gt;When he's given a good delivery

We simply haven't been giving Carroll the delivery that he needs. Or using him in the way that Newcastle did.

11 goals over 19 appearances in the Premier League. Were those 11 goals a bit more luck than skill and now he's crumbling under the weight of the pressure? Perhaps.

That leads to the next point merdock379 made: ""Comfort.""

Carroll simply isn't comfortable.

I think the somewhat obvious key here is Gerrard who can inspire a team on and off the pitch and hopefully that'll go a long way into getting the likes of Downing, Henderson and Charlie Adam to do what they do best and hopefully that results in goals for the team and Carroll.

Finally, I think to loan him out could be even more disastrous to Carroll's growth, it would be time away from a team that needs to learn to play with the big man and vice versa.",0,1326386167,null,0,false,0,c3ghhk8,t3_odw0d,t1_c3ghhk8,t3_odw0d,null,1428167751,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Those were called 'Magna-Clamps'. They attach to an object and cancel out it's mass letting a single person lift up to two tons of weight. That's imperial tons of course. Torchwood refuses to go metric.

Presumably from the name they attach with magnets, so I'm not sure if they would stick non-metallic objects. But I'm sure there were metal beams in the wall so it's probably not an issue.

Anyway, from that description, it would appear that they work by either blocking or canceling out the force of gravity on up to two tons of mass. Or possibly by applying an upward force on the object with up to two tons, the upward force would be scaled to the object's weight of course or else the object would fly off into the sky.

Scotland has a threefold choice in becoming independent and setting its own budget and policy; keep the pound but lose control and influence of interest rates to the Bank of England, adopt the Euro, set up a new currency.  Any one of those screams instability.


- A conservative estimate, with a small c, for the Scottish burden of UK debt on independence is about £3bn a year (excluding the bank bailout), so even if Salmond is successful in securing 90% of the oil fields - which by every account is extremely optimistic - would only be around £6bn so half of Scotland's oil income is wiped out on day one - and it still has a problem of a deficit and meeting independence costs.

- Scotland compared to the average UK currently has a poor growth rate.  50% poor.

- Whilst Scotland will no doubt successfully negotiate the rapids to establishing itself once it declares independence, it will never the less be tumultuous for a while and will face many challenges at a time the banking sector is going to be braving its own rapids itself.  It just makes sense to isolate itself as much as it can where possible, and unfortunately there's a very real opportunity to avoid the worst of it.

- Had it been independent at the time of the bailouts Scotland would have been swamped without the UK and would have been in the position of Ireland or worse, Iceland.  It doesn't bode well in terms of  confidence with an economy of £140bn, and with a country that is going to face quite a few costs in establishing independence.  Two banks with assets over 10x the annual economic output of the entire country.  When Salmond tried to blame the Scottish banks needing a bailout on London it was a line of prominent Scottish MSPs that took turns to tell him he was being delusional; Tavish Scott, Andy Kerr,  Iain Gray, Wendy Alexander who said - “Why did the first minister feed the nation these myths? Because he wanted to milk the age-old sense of victimhood – that ‘we wuz robbed’.”

- M&amp;G has already said that Scotland would struggle to gain an AAA rating on independence.

- And yes, if Scotland rejects the Union a lot of people in the UK are going to be asking why in times of austerity are they, the taxpayer who bailed the Scottish banks. whilst Scotland taxes them and enjoys their employ, their wage earners, why are they still paying for their finance sector - and Europe be damned. 

- UK-lite, without Scotland, would still be home to the world's leading financial center.

- Hate them or loathe them, there is a distinctly more friendly feel for the Conservatives south of the border, traditionally recognised as the banker's friend.  Scotland, nothing like.  Of course bankers are going to look at an independent Scotland that has failed to elect a single Tory and think that forecast pastures elsewhere are  looking more lush, and that, right or wrong, things are about to get more expensive for them in Scotland.  Who would you expect to tax the banks more; the Scottish Nationalists or the Tories in England?

It's never for charity organisations or independent businesses. That alone is highly suspect to me. The number of NEETs in this country right now is phenomenally high (I am one of them) and this is the government's ""solution"" - to essentially turn us into slave labour for corporations? 

And what really adds insult to injury is that they're coercing graduates into doing menial shop work. I can wager that the vast majority of these people have already worked in retail environments and as such, will gain absolutely nothing from it in the form of new skills that could increase their employability. If I'm going to choose between earning nothing by sweeping floors in Tesco or sitting at home *applying to actual jobs* or attending interviews, I think the answer is obvious. This is taking away valuable time that could be spent looking for work.

Funnily enough I am actually doing a work placement right now but it's not through the Job Centre - it's through a different program that's still government-connected but I had the choice whether to do it or not. I chose to do it because I'm actually going to gain new skills and it's something valuable to add to my CV (that and it could potentially become a paid job). Additionally I'm working at a local charity as opposed to a corporation. But my situation, unlike the Tesco and Poundland slaves, has a silver lining and a possible good outcome.

If this work placement scheme is here to stay, it should be strictly for charities and it should be GUARANTEED to teach the job seekers new and valuable skills that they can take with them into a paid position.

When it was unveiled a year and a half/two years ago he said that it was unofficial, and still a work in progress.

&gt;Paul McGann appeared last week at the Armageddon Pop Culture Expo in Auckland, New Zealand.  While there he unveiled a new costume for his Doctor.  According to McGann, it’s a work-in-progress and it’s still unofficial.  McGann is hopeful it will be adopted by the folks at Big Finish, who produce the Doctor Who audio adventures.

Vulnerable people will always be pray to unscrupulous sales tactics whether it is banks selling PPI or dodgy fundraising companies. Generally, people with less money, like smaller businesses compared to large ones, are more philanthropic than wealthy people, in the UK and in my experience anyway. 

The reason they want regular donations is for long term strategic planning. It is much harder to develop new services or facilities if you don't have a reliable income, which is what direct debits are. I know some people forget, but they all get communications from charities reminding them and thanking them so I don't think that is as common as you think. What's the grey area dude? Some charities are brilliantly transparent, others not so much. If you donate to my charity I'll tell you exactly what will happen, where it will go and whether you want to reserve it for a specific service.

My ill feelings come from when aggressive sales are used to sell goods, associated accessories or warranties I feel (rightly or wrongly) that the exploitation is in some way justified in that they are preying on someone's want for a better deal for themselves. I know that if I go into a showroom, this is what I will get. I know others don't, and I know it's the same kind of preying on the vulnerable that I said these chuggers sometimes do. My problem is that the chuggers are preying on these people's sincere want to help people for personal (and corporate) profit.

In all honesty, our team is much better suited to the Luis Suarez type of striker who plays on the ground and uses his abilities to move through defenders. Carroll seemed like an odd choice then, but when you throw in Downing, Adam, Henderson, and Enrique it all made perfect sense on paper. The pass and move philosophy is not what Carroll excelled at when he was at Newcastle, and he plays like a big target man that also scored some of the best poachers goals last season.

He also doesn't quite look fit. He's always a yard off and chasing everything, and that's usually because his first touch is not that great. He hasn't looked fit since his injury, but I'm sure after this summer he'll come good for us next year.

- Are you nuts? I'd love to live in Canada.

- You'll need about 4-6 weeks deposit, plus letting agent fees. Double your monthly rent to get an approximation of what you'll need up front. PLUS a month rent in advance.

- Use [www.rightmove.com](http://www.rightmove.com) and [gumtree.com/brighton](http://www.gumtree.com/brighton) to find places. 

- If you can, get a property that has [virgin cable](http://www.virginmedia.com/), that way you can get cable TV+net+phone in one package. Otherwise it's just going to be freeview (who watches TV anyway?) + ADSL (which can be pretty slow depending where you live). Most providers will only do 12 month contracts.

- Mobile: They're all as bad as each other. 

- Car: Parking permits can be a nightmare. Use [this](http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1129661) to find out if the street you're looking at has a permit scheme. Some places you need to wait 18 months or so to get a permit, so if a car is *really* important, you might want to look into making sure your place has offroad parking. The place I moved to had a 12 month wait for a permit, so sold my car.

- Maybe go to the Brighton Reddit meets. I hear they're good, but have yet to go to one :)

You make some interesting points about charities picking up where social services have left off. I quite agree that it would be preferable for government to do this work rather than waging unpopular foreign wars and leaving deserving causes at the mercy of charities. But I also think we [the public] are creating a catch 22 situation by giving so generously to ""home"" causes: the more *we* give to charities, the more the *government* thinks it's okay to cut services, the more the needy end up at the mercy of charities, and the more we're prevailed upon to give.

**BAE:** Because I look on my right, I cannot pass the ball. On my left, was the same problem.

So because I am a defender is better to lose ball far away (unintelligible) as in is my feet.

And then I will counterattack. So I say okay, I will try. If I kill one supporter, sorry, and unlucky.

But I try and I score, so very good thing.

The letters are nothing to worry about, they just go out automatically to anyone without a T.V license and as long as you tell them your status you're fine. It's very unlikely they'll pursue it further. If you fail to respond after multiple letters they may involve the courts, but that's a very remote prospect. Your own affirmation that 'I do not watch live tv on the internet and can not use my tv set to watch tv' is legally sufficient to cover you in that case provided they don't have any solid evidence of that being false. 

On the other hand, it's only bloody T.V licensing, it's not the FEDS for goodness sakes, they're not scary. Unless you're growing weed or storing corpses I'd invite them in for a cup of tea and a quick glance at the TV if they come a-knocking. 
TV licensing people are just people that work for TV licensing. They are humans. Of a sort. I had one a few years back who had to be persuaded the microwave was not also a T.V. They're usually more scared of you than you are of them.

Also, I don't believe she has two hearts.

Now, with Time Lords, they have triple helix DNA. Humans only have double helix. Presumably, the machine wasn't designed for Time Lords. Only Humans and the Hath, which most likely also have double helix DNA since they're evolved from fish. So, it's not too far out to assume it only took information from the two helixes, since that's how it's programmed. It's the third helix that give Time Lords the ability to regenerate. So, under that logic, it makes sense that she has two hearts, yet cannot regenerate.

I would never encourage anyone who volunteers in such a role to guilt trip, rather i'd do everything we can to make it the least intimidating as we can. As you say, it's the system that you object to not the people. Ultimately charities wouldn't do it if it didn't work and the supermarkets wouldn't allow it if they got too many complaints. Saying that i've found them much harder to secure in the past year or so. 

You're right about the catch 22 and is another of the reasons I don't like fundraising, despite being a fundraiser. We need to deal with the root of problems at a systemic level rather than getting charities to deal with the consequences. We should penalise people with second homes and invest in a wedge of social housing to eliminate homelessness etc. This is why i'd rather work in advocacy than fundraising, it is the only real way we will make progress. Almost all disabled services should be part of the NHS, they tend to all be preventative services anyway as they reduce falls, depression and increase mobility and access. In Derby they are cutting the rehabilitation service for blind people meaning they will be left in their homes and unable to adapt their lives and access work, will become depressed and not develop the skills to be able to live without assistance. It's short sighted if you excuse the pun. In the mean time, we should support the causes which really need the money and aren't fundraising whilst operating with massive reserves.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"If this will be your first viewing of the movie, there's a few disclaimers I'd like to toss your way.  Believe me, they will help in the enjoyment of the movie.

First of all, keep in mind that it is a glorified pilot episode. Imagine if all we had to go off of Eccleston was 'Rose'. It's kind of like that. The movie brings up a lot of issues that never get addressed, but that's because they were meant to be addressed later when the tv show arose from the movie.

Soon into the movie it is stated that The Doctor is half human. This has angered a lot of people, but has later been explained as the eighth Doctor has stated that he was using the chameleon arch to trick an enemy(IDW series: The Forgotten).

Finally, the beginning does make sense, but it's only properly explained in the books. The movie, admittedly, does a very poor job of setting things up in this department. The Master was working with the Daleks, but is later found out by them to have betrayed them. Before extermination, he sends out a psychic distress call to The Doctor. The Master didn't ask for rescue, but to have his remains returned to Gallifrey. The Doctor obliges his enemy's last request as he remembers that they were once friends, and that it'd be wrong of him to deny such a final request from anyone. Thus he steals The Master's remains from The Daleks, and that's where the movie starts.",0,1326401868,null,0,false,0,c3gkhli,t3_oe27m,t1_c3gkhli,t1_c3gkahh,null,1435748229,14,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,14
true,TabascoQuesadilla,mcgann,McGann,"*Doctor Who* (1996) (the TV movie) is the only televised, live-action performance by McGann as the Eighth Doctor.  It's not very good, but his performance is.

There was a webcast (Flash animated) version of *Shada* that starred McGann you may be able to find online, but the animation is pretty shitty.  You'd be better off listening to the extended Big Finish audio-only version.

And that brings us to where McGann really shines - the Big Finish audio dramas.  I made a list of these in order a while ago, but have no idea where it is, so here it is again - I split it into ""seasons"" based on the audio drama's release date, and don't include certain ""non-Big-Finish-canon"" episodes (like the 3/4 of *The Company of Friends* that's all about novel and comic book companions).

Anyway, my hopefully-complete list of Eighth Doctor audio dramas by Big Finish:

**Season 1**

- *Shada* (note: this can easily be skipped, but it *is* quite good)
- *Storm Warning*
- *Sword of Orion*
- *The Stones of Venice*
- *Minuet in Hell*

**Season 2**

- *Invaders from Mars*
- *The Chimes of Midnight*
- *Seasons of Fear*
- *Embrace the Darkness*
- *The Time of the Daleks*
- *Neverland*

**Season 3**

- *Zagreus*
- *Scherzo*
- *The Creed of the Kromon*
- *The Natural History of Fear*
- *The Twilight Kingdom*

**Season 4**

- *Faith Stealer*
- *The Last*
- *Caerdroia*
- *The Next Life*

**Season 5**

- *Terror Firma*
- *Scaredy Cat*
- *Other Lives*
- *Time Works*

**Season 6**

- *Something Inside*
- *Memory Lane*
- *Absolution*
- *The Girl Who Never Was*

**Season 7** (""The New Eighth Doctor Adventures Season 1"")

- *Blood of the Daleks*
- *Horror of Glam Rock*
- *Immortal Beloved*
- *Phobos*
- *No More Lies*
- *Human Resources*

**Season 8** (""The New Eighth Doctor Adventures Season 2"")

- *Dead London*
- *Max Warp*
- *Brave New Town*
- *Skull of Sobek*
- *Grand Theft Cosmos*
- *The Zygon Who Fell to Earth*
- *Sisters of the Flame*
- *The Vengeance of Morbius*

**Season 9** (""The New Eighth Doctor Adventures Season 3"")

- *Orbis*
- *Hothouse*
- *The Beast of Orlok*
- *Wirrn Dawn*
- *Scapegoat*
- *The Cannibalists*
- *The Eight Truths*
- *Worldwide Web*

**Season 10** (""The New Eighth Doctor Adventures Season 4"")

- *Death in Blackpool*
- *An Earthly Child* (note: not from the NEDA range; subscriber-only exclusive, but it's important and it definitely goes here)
- *Situation Vacant*
- *Nevermore*
- *The Book of Kells*
- *Deimos*
- *The Resurrection of Mars*
- *Relative Dimensions*
- *Prisoner of the Sun*
- *Lucie Miller*
- *To the Death*

**Season 11** (note: these all take place before ""Season 1,"" but reference things you don't learn about until ""Season 5.""  Since they were mostly released after the NEDA range ended, I've placed them here.)

- *The Company of Friends: Mary's Story* (note: the rest of TCoF is non-canon, unless you consider the comic books and/or novels to be canon as well as the audio dramas)
- *The Silver Turk*
- *The Witch from the Well*
- *Army of Death*

So, there you are.  My personal favorites of the bunch are *Storm Warning*, *The Stones of Venice*, *Invaders from Mars*, *The Chimes of Midnight*, *Scherzo*, *The Natural History of Fear*, *Caerdroia*, *The Zygon Who Fell to Earth*, *Relative Dimensions*, and *Lucie Miller*/*To the Death*, which is one of my favorite *Doctor Who* stories of all time.",0,1326401871,null,0,false,0,c3gkhm7,t3_oe27m,t1_c3gkhm7,t1_c3gjqwf,null,1435748229,14,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,14

If one looks at the wage increases for the directors on the FTSE, these people whose income well outstrips what they need are getting more money. This is money which, in an efficient system, would be going elsewhere to develop jobs and boost the economy.

What 'efficiency' is about is keeping costs to a minimum while those at the top profit the most, that is the private sector efficiency. The public sector efficiency is different because there is nobody up top to profit, the service itself is delivered at a metaphorical 'ground level' and thus efficiency takes a different route.

Cost cutting is an exercise to maximise profits, which largely doesn't exist in public sector work.

This ties in to productivity because it's about 'the greatest gain for the minimum cost'.

It has all Davros stories (all have Daleks) of the classic series, all the radio dramas (which are even more character depth awesome) with top notch CGI animation to accompany them, and one of the classic episodes is remastered. There's also a documentary thing and tons of behind the scenes stuff.

And then a quick rundown...

**William Hartnell, first**- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore.

**Patrick Troughton, second** - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

**Jon Pertwee, third**- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

**Tom Baker, fourth** The most famous run. There are so many fantastic stories. Genesis of the Daleks, one of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic. And Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

**Peter Davison, fifth** -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special, andCaves of Androzani!* (the last story)

**Colin Baker, sixth**- His Doctor is unique with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good.

**Sylvester McCoy, seventh**. Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis. This is the era where they really try some crazy radical stories.",0,1326405371,null,0,false,0,c3gl702,t3_oe7pc,t1_c3gl702,t3_oe7pc,null,1428169571,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Carroll looked quite dangerous when we had 5 midfielders trying to supply him. Henderson, Gerrard and Bellamy provided good support for Carroll whos presence ultimately led to a number of chances. He can only do so much in attack by himself. It's also worth noting that he put a good defensive shift in for us.

Henderson has been a good signing for us. Downing doesn't look as though he's fitting in. Bellamy and Spearing are great players to have backing up the first team. Charlie Adam plays well when Lucas relieves pressure in the midfield. Ultimately, we're missing a quality left mid and Lucas. Out midfield dies need some upgrading though.

Dalglish needs to shape the team up some more. I'm not his biggest fan, I find his use of substitutes to have been woeful this year and his squad selection under par.

It does if you use it to watch live TV. Not sure whether you can do so on the web, but you certainly can on the iPad app, for example, and you'd need a TV licence for that to be legal. 

Agree with the general advice though; don't even respond to them unless they come to your door with the police and a search warrant. 

That said, the BBC provides a wonderful service through the TV and radio, and the web offerings are fantastic.

I actually disagree with you about Downing. I think he's mostly been good (not great) with a couple of exceptions. Against city he wasn't good, I agree. But when we play him on the right along with Johnson he has looked dangerous. He needs to work on his crossing though. I almost forgot what a good cross looked like until Gerrard came back. 

As for Dalglish he's been mostly great. I don't always agree with his subs and at 60 mins I start pulling my hair out occasionally but he has pulled through in the big games. I remember last year against Chelsea when he surprised everyone by playing 3 at the back and we killed them. They even admitted to be taken aback by his tactics. And against city going with 6 defense in the second was risky and took some balls. There's a reason Kenny is the only one to leave the Etihad with a clean sheet since Oct 2010.

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"
My work (a large company) is currently running this. We have 6 new starters (been there about 3 weeks) doing 30 hour weeks for their benefits. One has a child so gets slightly more than the 200 a month the others get, one is a biochemistry graduate, most of the rest were made redundant from old jobs, and we have one guy who is just unemployed (but not for lack of trying.)

They're all competing for maximum two positions as temps over christmas. If they get this job their temp contracts will run out on the 31st of December. Whilst doing this unpaid work we have hired two temps to bolster numbers who are actually already working and earning a wage. The guys on benefits are hella mad.

The boss has already made it clear that the reason we're doing this as a company is to 'save hours', basically the 30 hours of work per week, per person, are hours that my boss doesn't 'spend' on regular employees. This puts him in the good books with his bosses (no hours spent = no money dished out), and it also leaves him with some extra to give to the employees who have worked there for a while over Christmas (we'll see how many of them he's actually willing to spend, however.)

I am the only person in my work who sees a real problem with this, and have unfortunately been given a condescending nickname (which backfired because i display it proudly around the workplace) as 'suffragette.' The others say 'it's not our problem' and 'it's training though, work experience so they can get jobs in the future'. My actual pleas for logic and reason (that they won't be getting jobs with schemes like this in place to exploit them) fall on deaf ears.

Kinda shitty really; they're all working their absolute arses off, especially the guy with the kid; who basically has said if he doesn't get this job he is going to be in more debt because he's wasted this month of unpaid work because he's had to pay for travel and food instead of staying at home and cooking for a lot cheaper.

Really pisses me off; they're all really excellent people and i want them all to get hired. It's not going to happen though, seems like we're set to keep one, *maybe* two people on and that's it. 

also, since the time i wrote this, all original 6 starters have finished, but have been replaced with 6 more. None of the original six were kept on, and none of these 6 will either.

Living on 3k a year as a student is easy, especially as many students share student houses in order to cut down costs (250 a month for a 5 bedroom house right near the university, and then an extra hundred every 3 months for bills? Piece of piss.)

I'm sure they can do just fine, but how do my Scottish Reddit cousins  see the following panning out?

-The Oil.. do you really think you'll get to keep it?

-Defense... what sort of defense/protection will there be from forreigners.. yes its highly unlikely to be invaded but surely it needs something if not for humanitarian or to protect the isle of GB?

-Monarchy? Ditch the lot or keep the queen same as Canada?

-Currency? GBP or Euro or Some local currency?

-Tax.. do you reckon it'll go down?  Surely with a lower population the standards would theoretically be lower.. if the majority of tax revenue comes from London?

The last country to leave the UK was Ireland in 1922, there is/was obvious bitterness and they quickly became a republic and grew to distance themselves.. but initally they had treaties to say they'd side with the UK on matters of concern, the UK had bases/ports there etc.. do you see it being like that without the violence?

&gt; had RBS &amp; HBOS bailed out

To be fair, those banks collapsed because of a lack of proper government regulation. I would contend that a Scottish government wouldn't have allowed it. The SNP have publicly criticised the mismanagement of banking regulation from the UK government. Another thing is that the collapse of those banks would have hurt England more than it would hurt Scotland, since most of their operations are south of the border. Professor Andrew Hughes Hallett of St Andrews University has said:


""In the case of the RBS, I’m not sure of the exact numbers, but roughly speaking 90% of its operations are in England and 10% are in Scotland, the result being, by that convention, therefore, that the rest of the UK would have to carry 90% of the liabilities""


There's a another professor (international finance law) called George Walker who has said similar things to Andrew Hughs (worth reading up on, but I don't see much point in dragging out more quotes).

As for the question of whether Edinburgh would have existed on it's own, the fact is that the entire financial industry was created on the back of the UKs oil sales. The old McCrone report actually predicted this in the 70s, suggesting that an independent Scotland would be a massive attraction to foreign investment.

If someone records TV programs to DVD and gives them to you to watch, you still don't need a TV licence - there may be a copyright issue, of course, but that's completely separate.

Also, it's their responsibility to prove that you're watching TV - it's not your responsibility to prove that you don't.

I don't have a licence (or a TV) myself. Every once in a while, the TV licence people start sending threatening letters.

Because having the SNP as a party that can administrate every matter in the country is a much better alternative than the Tories, Liberal Democrats or Labour due to the much higher calibre of their politicians, simply in terms of competence if nothing else.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor.

The thing is, it doesn't matter where a bank's operations are, it's where it's registered that takes the hit. Most of RBS' toxic assets were from the USA, and most of the risks currently stem from investments in Greece etc.

Regardless of these facts, Scotland has piggybacked on England for much of the UK's 'greatness', Scotland entered into the union in order to  get a slice of the action and political power that England had at the time, after a failed colonial attempt.

True that those figures do not take into account resource wealth, but that won't be around forever, and if you genuinely think Scotland would be better off with less world political leverage (when in fact Scottish MPs can vote in Westminster, but vice versa is not true) then fair enough.

I think it would be a shame (as a person of Scottish descent) to separate in a time when political powers are becoming more centralized.

The fact however that Scotland will have to re-ratify with the EU means its taking a Tobin tax whether it likes it or not.  Alex Salmond doesn't want to pay anything for the third and fourth largest employers in Edinburgh, RBS and HBOS, which the UK has bailed out and now has controlling shareholdings in.  Alex Salmond wants to tax these.  He wants them to stay in Edinburgh.  He wants them to do it under god knows what currency and god knows who controls it, he wants the share holders to shut up and put up, he wants them to do it despite what looks like Scotland not being able to retain a AAA rating, he wants to do it whilst the country takes on what would be record debt on its own and whilst still providing services through the 1st, 2nd and 5th largest employers; the council, the NHS, and the university, whilst paying for a set up of an independent country, and after conservative debt repayments leaving only £3bn of oil revenue per year - disregarding the extra refinery costs it would incur outside of the UK, and he's going to cut corporation tax?!?

...all the while he wants the people that would now own the banks in a separate country, as an independent country, to say nothing as they take their own job losses and austerity measures.  And for banks, major hubs, that if they need another bailout, or even just nurturing, he doesn't stand a chance with because they amass 12x the equity of Scotland's output.

Alex Salmond, the SNP, and anybody that believes him, is in Cloud Cuckoo Land.  

I don't say it to derive any satisfaction, or even to deride others.  If people think the banks will either want to stay, or that those that own them would want them to stay, or even allow them to stay, then the information on which people are making their decision about independence is flawed to the core and built on complete fabrication.

&gt;IIRC the SNP have promised better corporation tax than England (but I may be wrong here). 

Well then let me set you straight.  It's not a case of what is promised.  It's a case of that Scotland can't afford it.  Independence itself is going to be costly enough, it's going to have to take on relative UK debt, and Scotland already has enjoyed inflated social provision compared to the rest of the UK - and Scotland doesn't take kindly to those sort of cuts.  They don't elect Tories anymore, do they.

We've seen this before.  It's exactly what Ireland did!  Inflated public sector, marginal corporation tax (and Osbourne's already reducing his) and forget the old canard of oil -£3bn is the Scottish take home after repayments to subsidise everything and go head to head with the rest of the UK on corporation tax, when Scottish growth is near half of the UK average.

And...

        ""The SNP admit that their Corporation Tax proposals may
         take twenty years to make as little as 1% difference.  In
         the meantime they admit that services will have to be cut
         to balance the books. Nurses, teachers and public services
         will feel the brunt of the black hole blown in Scotland’s 
         finances, while the biggest businesses get cash rewards.""

                                                         Willie Rennie MSP, 8 Sept, 2011

Oh, sure, Scotland will settle for Scottish Thatcher MkII and slash welfare whilst banks owned by the UK pay dividends to them.  The SNP will be chased out of Holyrood and the banks will leave, if not sooner because they'll see all this coming too and know he can't deliver on his promises.

I write to inform you that I do not require a TV license at the above property. There is no equipment installed or used at this address that is capable of receiving broadcast TV programmes in the manner prescribed by you. I state this in full awareness of the requirements set out in Part 4 of the Communications Act 2003 on Licensing of TV Reception: also, I am fully aware of the requirements on TV licensing set out in the Communication (Television Licensing) Regulations 2004.

I do not want to receive from you reminders that this address is unlicensed. Further, I do not want to receive from you correspondence suggesting that I might be using TV receiving equipment at this address, threatening investigation by a TV licensing enforcement officer. Your letters are distressing and cause me anxiety. Any such correspondence will be an offence under the Malicious Communications Act 1988 since you have no reasonable grounds for demanding that this address requires a TV licence.

I will not tolerate any visit by a TV licensing enforcement officer at my address. Therefore I withdraw from TV Licensing, its employees and/or its agents, the implied right of access to my property at XXXXXXXXXX. Henceforth, no employee or agent of TV Licensing qualifies as an invitee to my property. Any such person who ventures onto my property at XXXXXXXXX will be trespassing on my land, and I shall not hesitate to seek legal redress for the offence caused.

Please note that I am under no obligation to provide you with any of my details, including my name. This fact was confirmed by the BBC in June 2009 in response to FOI request RFI20090807. This response states that ""TV Licensing does not legally require the name of an individual to action such a request"".

Any request by you for further information will be considered to be harrassment, and I would again draw your attention to the offences under the Malicious Communications Act 1988.

You are invited to reply to this letter solely to acknowledge that I have given you formal notice as to my position.

* Car: Last time I checked parking permits are avaliable (no waiting list) in Kemptown. Permits are roughly £110/year I think, and if you want people over you'll need visitor permits, which are limited to 50/resident/year and priced at £2 each (valid for 1 day). Pay and display parking is also available but permits are much cheaper.
* TV &amp; Broadband.: I've never heard good things about Virgin, so I'd never use or recommend them. Sky are OK and you can get a good deal on the broadband if you take out a TV subscription. If you're looking to save money you can go with Freeview or Freesat. Freeview coverage varies a lot around Brighton (lots of hills in the way) use the [checker](http://freeview.co.uk/Services/Freeview2) to see if you can get a decent selection of channels. For good broadband check the [list of LLU providers for the Kemptown exchange](http://www.kitz.co.uk/adsl/adslchecker.php) (sample postcode BN2 1TF), these can offer up to 24mbit speeds. DO NOT get broadband from BT. Be, O2 and Sky all offer reasonable ""unlimited"" broadband. [Be](https://www.bethere.co.uk) are particularly good IMO, and are one of the few offering truly unlimited service.
* Mobile: O2 and Vodafone offer good coverage in Brighton. Three are a bit crap from what I've heard. Also, if you take out a contract with O2 you can get £5/mo off a broadband subscription with them, and if you stay with them for two years you can then get half off again. I pay £6.25/month for an ""unlimited"" up to 21mbit connection, pretty good.
* Avoid west street on a Friday/Saturday night, unless you like shitty clubs and getting into fights.
* There are some excellent pubs in Brighton center (Kemptown, the Lanes and North Laine), but once you've settled in check out some of the others further out, such as Hannover or towards Hove, some real gems out there.

**The First Doctor** (William Hartnell)

- *The Beginning* (kind of a cheat since it has 3 stories, but they're the first 3, so there's no excuse to not see them!)
- *The Dalek Invasion of Earth* if you want two Dalek stories (*The Daleks* being included in *The Beginning*)
- *The Time Meddler* if you don't (also the first non-Doctor Time Lord you meet, though the name Time Lord doesn't come about for a few more years)

**The Second Doctor** (Patrick Troughton)

- *The Tomb of the Cybermen*
- *The War Games* (intro to Gallifrey; first time the Time Lords are named)

**The Third Doctor** (Jon Pertwee)

- *Spearhead from Space* (his first story; very good, introduces Autons)
- *The Daemons* (has the first Master in it, though it's not his introduction; that would be *Terror of the Autons*)
- *The Three Doctors* (I know, I picked three, but this one doesn't really count since it has, well, three Doctors in it)

**The Fourth Doctor** (Tom Baker)

- *Genesis of the Daleks*
- *City of Death*

**The Fifth Doctor** (Peter Davison)

- *Earthshock*
- *The Caves of Androzani*
- *The Five Doctors* (again, I picked three since this one is a multi-Doctor story)

**The Sixth Doctor** (Colin Baker)

- *Attack of the Cybermen*
- *Trial of a Time Lord* (technically a full season, but it's sold as a single story)
- *The Two Doctors* (again, listing 3 since this one's multi-Doctor)

**The Seventh Doctor** (Sylvester McCoy)

- *Remembrance of the Daleks*
- *Survival* (last story of the original run)

**The Eighth Doctor** (Paul McGann)

- *Doctor Who* (1996) (this is the TV movie; his only televised appearance)
- *Shada* (webcast/audio drama remake of an incomplete Fourth Doctor story; the animation is shitty, so I'd just go with the extended audio drama version)
- I also wanted to pick one Big Finish audio drama for Eight, but I'm split between two, so I'll list both - *The Chimes of Midnight* and *Seasons of Fear*.

*Reporter:* Okay, Benoit, well, what an absolutely fantastic goal. Tell us about it.

*BAE:* Uh, Is my **second accident in three years.**

So, was okay, and, you know, before to score the first goal, I was worried about my first goal, and when I score the first goal, I say, **well maybe if I score one goal in my career (it) will be not enough to show to my son or my daughter later.**

So two? I am very happy. And once again, very important. I'm very happy for me and for the team.

*Reporter:* When you got the ball, what did you think? Cause I immediately thought: ""there's nothing on it""

*BAE:* Because I look on my right, I cannot pass the ball. On my left, was the same problem.
So because I am a defender is better to lose ball far away (unintelligible) as in is my feet.
And then I will counterattack. 

So I say okay, I will try. **If I kill one supporter, sorry, and unlucky.**
But I try and I score, so very good thing.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;You simply cannot state what 'Scotland would have done' etc.
The thing is, it doesn't matter where a bank's operations are, it's where it's registered that takes the hit. Most of RBS' toxic assets were from the USA, and most of the risks currently stem from investments in Greece etc.

The blame for the collapse of the banking sector in this country lies squarely with the UK government, the lack of regulation in that sector (due to banking deregulation in the 80s) is a absolute disgrace that has put our whole economy at risk. The scottish government and the SNP have had nothing to do with this.


The people I quoted, who take the view that the UK government is mostly liable, are respected academics. I think they damn well know what they're talking about.


&gt;True that those figures do not take into account resource wealth, but that won't be around forever ...

In regards to the oil running out, the SNP intends to create an oil fund to safeguard Scotland's future. They have pushed for such a 'oil fund' (similar to what Norway have) for quite a while now [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8168880.stm] and I feel that this is the only sensible thing you can do with finite resource like oil. The SNP also has a very serious policy of investing in renewables, we get about 1/3 of our power from renewables [http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/dec/22/scottish-renewable-electricity-record-year]

&gt; ... and if you genuinely think Scotland would be better off with less world political leverage (when in fact Scottish MPs can vote in Westminster, but vice versa is not true) then fair enough.

An independent Scotland would have more say in its foreign policy and international relations. We don't realistically have any say right now, the government in the UK can decide to go to war (like it has in Iraq for example) and we don't really have any say in the matter. Right now, our international relations are controlled by a tory government we did not vote for. As for the West Lothian question, I'm in total agreement, Scottish MPs should not be able to vote on matters that only impact England (the SNP MPs refrain from voting on those matters on principle). 

&gt; I apologize for any perceived hostility in these replies, but it always irks me when people put nationalism ahead of greater goals.

I don't think that this is about nationalism. I know that it isn't for me at least. We just want the right

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Mmm if you want episodes that are continuity relevant..well those aren't always the good ones, but The Deadly Assassin and Invasion of Time are relevant Time-Lordy episodes.

I don't really think the Edge of Destruction is relevant, but it is interesting, being a story that takes place entirely within the TARDIS. As for McCoy, I think that The Greatest Show in the Galaxy and Dragonfire are must-haves, though not really continuity relevant.

For Colin Baker, Trial of a TL is continuity relevant, but c'mon, Vengenace on Varos is an absolute must- it's his best story. For Pertwee, Planet of the Spiders is something you should have- he regenerates.  Tomb of the Cybermen isn't really continuity relevant- it's a good story (being one of the few existing ones) but I think The Mind Robber was better. Spot on with the War Games- an absolute must.

For Hartnell you need the existing episodes (3 of 4) of The Tenth Planet- his regeneration episode and the introduction of famous villains. If you can get used to reconstructions, you should watch one online of Power of the Daleks, Troughton's first story- it's one of the best Dalek stories (if you're adjusted to the recon fatigue and slowness of old tv). And for T. Baker, I think Robots of Death and Face of Evil are fantastic, even if not continuity relevant.

I mean really, getting an idea of the classic's history is like cherry picking episodes from the new series. Your picture of it will never be complete, though as far as relevant information goes- yeah you got it. There's only some episodes that tell you about the Doctor in the new series, yet you just need a large quanitity in general to understand the tone, format, and feel of the ""thingy"" as a whole.

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"Nope, my sums are correct.Students aren't at University for 12 months. Not even 10 come to think of it, 1st Sep- Dec (christmas break) 30th Jan-June (Summer Break) that's 9 months in total really. Most Uni courses are, in fact, 30 weeks long.

Also, 3,000 is the bare **minimum** a student will get a year, in 3 £1,000 installments. There are students i know getting much more than that, closer to the tune of 5,000 (outside of London) and 6,000 (though this is studying in London) The reason that students get 3,000 as the minimum is because student loans are calulated based on your parents income. It is expected that parents who earn a lot, help their children with costs at University, hence only 3,000. I'm not comfortable with any student earning that much, i think they really should get a lot more to help with food, rent, bills, bus travel etc. But that doesn't mean that living on 3k as a student isn't easy. Living on the poverty line goes hand in hand with the perceived 'student lifestyle' and not only do many of us put up with it, many of us revel in it, using our new-found independence to learn the hard way about things like budgeting and paying bills.

&gt;(No, there are never enough houses 'right near' the university). And you have to pay back this money.

There are in Manchester, the main student population lives in Fallowfield, with a few living in Hulme. You can walk from Fallowfield to the University in about 15 minutes. It usually takes longer on the bus because of the mass of traffic jams on the main road (one of the reasons they wanted to make that main road buses only at one point.)

People on jobseekers may also qualify for Housing Benefits, but many will not. Many will still stay at home with their parents, but still be expected to contribute to the upkeep of the house. Many will live with partners who may also be jobless. In this case, only one person can claim housing benefits, which may not cover the full cost of their rent and bills.

&gt;(Before we get into this i must be clear again i'm focusing really on those without large net tax contributions..mostly those who never work)

But that's the thing, it's silly to make that distinction because a vast amount of people on jobseekers allowance are those who have lost their jobs and are looking for work. My dad was made redundant a few months ago. On his last day they had a meeting where they all explained signing on and all that carry on. He gets £65 a week, without any housing benefits on top of that, and is expected to be able to pay the mortgage and bills with his woeful redundancy payment. My mum, thankfully, still has her job, and a pretty well paid one at that. My dad was an unskilled labourer all his life and is now stuck without a job, slim prospects of getting one, and increasing pressure from everyone as the money dwindles as the bills get paid. 

I do not think a claimant has a greater right to food than a student, but i do think that they usually have higher food costs, especially as many students share the cost of the shopping between several of them. I think a claimant has a greater right to a car than a student (though i do think this is only if they already own a car when they enter jobseekers, not that they get one just because they want one) because it is a valuable means of transportation for their day-to-day lives, it helps with transporting them to-from job interviews, and also helps them in their family lives (dependent on individual situations ofc.)

All of this detracts from the point of the article however, the fact that they expect by giving people 'work experience' they are going to make them more employable. When really all that happens is that companies like Poundland, Argos, Tesco etc, get free, 30 hour per week, labour **indefinitely**. They don't need to create jobs for people, they're being given free labour already, why waste money on hiring people you can get for free?

It's a kick in the teeth to those who are claiming, and is just a sham-scheme which, although it does help some workers with work exp, mainly works to fill the pockets of big companies.

Tesco's current success is widely credited to the previous CEO, who had been in the job 20 years.

In one recent year, £1 in every £7 spent in the UK was spent in Tesco. 

20 years ago, Tesco was nothing like as significant as that - I think Sainsbury's was dominant back then. Tesco was more like a second-rate supermarket - it was more associated with its ""value"" products, it certainly didn't have the reputation now held by it's ""finest"" range.

So lots of people had invested on the basis of this phenomenal success and growth, and that had to plateau some time. 

IMO the last CEO retired at the absolutely best time he possibly could - his entire tenure was characterised by growth and profit and he'll be remembered as possibly the best CEO Tesco ever had, probably as a British business icon for these decades. I kinda feel a little sorry for his replacement, because not only is it hard to top that, but he came in at time when Tesco could no longer sustain its success. I fear that this current guy may be remembered as the guy under whom Tesco wilted.

Although if you want to get technical, the revelation that the alternate leader was an alternate Doctor was revealed in one of the books.

Back at the situation at hand, what I'm describing *is* an alternate/parallell universe. That's how they work in Doctor Who. A changed Timeline needs the actual influence of a time traveller, but a parallell universe happens naturally. I don't know where you're getting your information from, but that's how it's been in Doctor Who since forever. Unless you care to source an episode that states Timelords exist across all realities. I have never heard that in any of the episodes, and completely contradicts everything that I have ever heard about alternate universes. From the TARDIS Wiki:

&gt;A parallel universe was a reality created when historical events diverged from the main timeline. Unlike alternate timelines, these occurred naturally.

http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Parallel_universe

&gt;An alternate timeline is a reality which is different from a parallel universe in that historical events have been altered by a time traveller or other temporal phenomena. These alterations can be prevented from having ever come to pass, although memories of them are usually retained.

*""For far too long we have been at the
mercy of ﬁnancial and economic decisions
taken outside Scotland. Under the current
framework, key economic policy levers,
including responsibility for supporting the
economy during downturns and the
operation of the tax system, are withheld
from the Scottish Government. This cannot
be in the best interests of the Scottish
economy; not now and not for the longterm. Now is the time for change.""*

How does Salmond expect to be able to support Scotland's economy during a downturn?  The only way he'll be able to do that is by printing his own currency, and I rather suspect that bond markets will rate his debt as ""junk"", making his borrowing rate sky high.  If he prefers to join the Euro...well, he's just in the same position as he is now, except with different coloured banknotes.

Personally I think this ""independence"" idea was cooked up around a bottle of whisky, took on a life of its own, and now everyone's too embarrassed to turn around and say it's a stupid idea.  And as a knee-jerk reaction to a Conservative government in London it's pretty pathetic.

I preface this by saying that these are just my opinions.

* The Oil - I don't think they can stop us, [this](http://i.imgur.com/G30Yu.gif) is the currently recognised border after an under-the-table ~~land~~ sea grab in 1999. It used to look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/iVgHS.jpg) and Scotland could argue for it back. They've been saying the oil is going to run out for years but current estimates say it will last until at least 2050. That being said I don't want to rely on the oil, I view it as a crutch to get things started until other stuff gets developed. Scotland is already a net exporter of energy to the rest of the UK and we have other industries beyond the oil.

* Defense - I'd say Scotland would maintain an armed force though a smaller one with no weapons of mass destruction. Probably best to look at similar sized countries for inspiration. Depending on how the resources are divided up and how the negotiations go we'd probably get a chunk of existing UK hardware or renounce that in exchange for some other consideration. I can see there being defense treaties and pacts with what remains of the UK though.

* Monarchy - I personally don't like the Monarchy but I think Salmond has said that he'd be okay with keeping them. I don't know how many properties Canada and Australia etc maintain for them right now, we'd probably get control over all the crown estate stuff in Scotland though or forego that control in exchange for something else.

* Currency - Not really sure about this, I think there has been some discussion with keeping Stirling but if not the Euro or a local would be okay with me. It probably won't happen straight away, it would need to gradual to keep things stable for everyone. Hopefully the Euro will have improved by 2014 or whenever anyway.

* Tax - Is just one way for the government to raise money, it'll probably go down it total terms but it might be more on a per capita basis. There are so many lies, fake statistics and propaganda out there that's it's hard to say for certain.

That oil we have is going to run out, and this makes starting an oil fund an absolute necessity, even if we need to cut back spending in the short term. The UK appear to have no long term plan for this limited resource (as Stiglitz points out in an interview he did in Edinburgh). The proposal for the oil fund isn't just somewhere to store the money, it will actively reinvest that money (sovereign wealth fund) and grow it slowly over time.

You can export renewable energy because you only need to get it onto the grid. There is a plan in the works to upgrade the transmission capabilities of places like the isle of lewis (for the big window farm project up there). 
The EU is also planning a long term project to construct a super grid for the whole of the EU, it's designed to allow exactly this type of exportation of energy. Many of the super grid proposals specifically include regions of Scotland and Ireland. That should give us more export routes if we need them in a decade or two down the line.

What about teachers who only teach the top end students, there is less room for those to improve, should they be worried about there job, and what about teachers who teach the bottom set students who struggle to improve regardless of teacher?

These in my opinion are more of an issue to teaching than the teachers, but very few wish to talk about that as its too close to home and it puts blame more on the parents/voters than teachers.

It seems that much of the time he is attacking or placed near the back post, with a lofted corner coming in which he is expected to knock down / back across the goal to provide assists, as clearly it is difficult to generate the kind of power to score from this situation. if you look at the likes of Skrtel and Agger they typically attack the near post and for that reason have managed to score from corners. Perhaps sending Carroll to the near post, where he can get across defenders using his power would be a better tactic, also to be used at wide free kicks.

General play he has been pretty poor though and this seems to be mainly a confidence issue. He is getting simple things like layoffs and knockdowns wrong and often overcomplicating things when holding up the ball. He has to get back to basics, one touch control, then layoff. He is not a player who is going to unlock defences with his guile but can be useful in the build up of a move before hopefully getting on the end of it. I don't think all hope is lost, but somehow he needs to regain the confidence he displayed the last couple seasons at Newcastle. He has enough to fit into our shorter passing game in the initial stages of play (surely he can pass a ball 10 yards).

I *can't* avoid conversations about the x-factor, strictly come dancing, doctor who or top gear. I'm not a dick about it; I put up with them, but I'm still exposed to the humour, the shared jokes. When I lived in a student house top gear was on dave all the time, so top gear was on *all the time*. I complained, but the laws of who has the remote always prevail. Sometimes you walk in on weird porn or bbc parliament, you just can't stop people. One housemate used to switch between top gear and sky sports news in an endless loop to see if something new had happened... It never did.

I'm not going to isolate myself from friends and family because I don't like a TV show. I'm not the kind of person that tells people to stop talking about their interests, but if they're allowed to talk about top gear then... well... I'm going to bitch about it on reddit. Seems fair enough to me.

&gt; 'This material is explicit. It is shattering the innocence of childhood... It was like a blue movie'. 

Quick question - Ms Leadsom, how do you know what a blue movie looks like?

Of course much porn is 'explicit' by definition, but an educational DVD? For some reason I automatically think that anything produced for children (in association with education experts?) has going to have had its content *carefully* considered, checked and mulled over for quite some time.

There will always be parents who don't want their kids knowing too much about sex which is why they have the option to remove their kids from the lessons. What a good idea that is in general... Those are the sorts of people who kicked up a fuss about the SRE bill that was defeated before the last election. Consider the differing views on sex etc. in America compared to much of Europe: Look at the number of teen pregnancies or STD infection rates in the US, then compare to Germany or Holland.

We *know* the way that they teach sex ed in such enlightened (for want of a better word) countries leads to less pregnancies, rates of disease and, subjectively, better attitudes to sex. The attitude expressed by the common-or-garden-old-school-tory here is precisely what we want to get away from: The basics about sex, the attendant problems, risks and mechanisms shouldn't have a mystique to kids. It shouldn't be something they find out about themselves with all the attendant cock ups. Pun intended.

With regards to the ""fuss about nothing"" aspect:

&gt; 'It looks bizarre, it's not missionary, the woman is on top and there's a children's voiceover saying something like 'Ooh, it looks like they are having fun.' 

1 - I didn't realise there was an all encompassing rule book that dictated how our species should procreate.     
2 - What did the child's voice-over say? What did it **actually** say? For some reason I'm calling bullshit on her worries there. If she can't say what was actually said then I have a feeling it's reactionary crap. I would put money on it being a question rather than a statement and the 'guiding adult' voice-over (which I also predict is there) is responding along the lines of: ""Well yes, many people see sex as being something fun.""

Also, the kid in the shower: There's a black box on the DM image, but you can clearly see pixels behind that. That implies to me that the pixels are in the actual video already and as such... 'explicit' is it?

TL;DR - Piss off with your antiquated views that sex is dirty and worrying, Leadsom.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"&gt;The first thing I need to say is the nature of the Barnett formula makes it difficult to have to have a real figure for how much Scotland must spend to run smoothly.

I don't see a problem with using the real figures for how much it actually *does* spend on a yearly basis.

&gt;As the delightful newspapers like the daily mail love pointing out, we have higher spending per head than the rest of the UK which must give our government comfortable scope for reducing expenditure.

Strange logic; are you suggesting that the UK spends too much in Scotland? That Scotland can 'comfortably' do with less? Better get the SNP to let the Treasury know; we wouldn't want to see all that money go to waste in a time of austerity. ;)

Scotland gets more down to a combination of the spread of its population, the poorer health of its population and the higher unemployment. I don't see how the SNP could change the former, and I'd love to see how they plan to address the latter two (they don't seem to have done much about it thus far). Addressing such complex social issues could hardly be done 'comfortably', and cutting spending so drastically would clearly cause a lot of pain.

&gt;That oil we have is going to run out, and this makes starting an oil fund an absolute necessity, even if we need to cut back spending in the short term. The UK appear to have no long term plan for this limited resource (as Stiglitz points out in an interview he did in Edinburgh). The proposal for the oil fund isn't just somewhere to store the money, it will actively reinvest that money (sovereign wealth fund) and grow it slowly over time.

The oil is already disappearing; some estimates have annual production down to a third of the peak of last decade by the end of this one. Its far too late to be fussing about a sovereign wealth fund, and even if it wasn't, it ignores the huge budget deficit/national debt Scotland would inherit by leaving the UK.

Remember, Norway is far, far wealthier in terms of natural resources then Scotland; it produces around twice as much oil and gas per capita. It also doesn't have crippling debt to deal with.

&gt;he EU is also planning a long term project to construct a super grid for the whole of the EU, it's designed to allow exactly this type of exportation of energy. 

Have you any idea how many wind farms would be required to not only meet Scotland's demand, but also export enough energy to make serious money? That grid is in place for the French over-supply of Nuclear power.",0,1326466746,null,0,false,0,c3gstmi,t3_oeb5z,t1_c3gstmi,t1_c3grh5e,null,1428173247,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,paolog,null,null,"&gt; is grammatically correct.

FTFY. ""Doctor Whom"" is grammatically incorrect.

Note that the verb ""to be"" is a special case: it *always* uses ""who"" and never ""whom"", whether ""who"" refers to the subject *or* the object. So:

Companion: ""That man over there is the Doctor.""

Stupid alien: ""Who is the Doctor?"" (**not** ""Whom is the Doctor?"")

Companion: ""I said, the Doctor is that man over there!""

Stupid alien: ""The Doctor is who?"" (**not** ""The Doctor is whom?"")

This is because, as you can see from the companion's statements, the subject and object can be switched round without changing the meaning, and ""who"" really refers to both the subject and the object.

Note, however, ""Whom is the Doctor talking to?"" is correct because the verb here is actually ""to talk"", and the ""is"" is just an auxiliary verb used to form the continuous present tense.

* Students are not unemployed, they are students.  This includes people doing useless courses used to massage figures.  Even if they don't go to the courses...
* Stay at home mums/dads are not ""unemployed"" if, either, they have paid in too little lifetime NI to claim dole OR their partner earns enough for them to no be able to claim (I think that means 26k total household income...).  The same applies to single parents.

i have a 9 month rent, we also have 9 month broadband plans too.

&gt;I don't know the details of Manchester's uni but it may well be an anomaly, being so cheap property in a dense area. Generally having to house ~20K people (plus any 'locals' who happen to live in that area) near one location means by definition not everyone can be close.

we literally have a student designated area with next to no normal residents living there. 

&gt;But not being unemployed?

it's not as acceptable to be so close to the poverty line when your financial obligations change as you are no longer a student.

&gt;This is the opposite to my experience, that students will most of the time eat independently and miss out on the bulk savings that a family would usually benefit from. Similarly, if you are expecting them to not have transport, they will often have to rely on smaller more expensive stores for their food.

this definitely isn't mine, we share all the food bills for the month, cook and eat together probably 4/5 days a week, making lots of things in bulk which we then freeze for later. The amount of money people act like students get is ridiculous, there's a lot of cost cutting, but we do get many discounts on things as well.

I just had an interesting thought based on your post. Admittedly it's closer to fanfiction than something that would happen, but I still like the idea.

Should the master return again (pick a method for his revival, it doesn't really matter how) he meets up with the doctor and gets him to agree to let him travel with him for awhile. So the master becomes the companion for the season, and they travel around reliving the good old days for awhile.

As for how can I judge.  I am a parent.  You are constantly judging.  I assume you have a child?  I am amazed you don't do this when dealing with teachers at your child's school.  That's pretty lax if you ask me.    My son is in year 6 now so that's a fair few teachers that he's had over the years. You meet with them  every single day, twice a day (primary school).  You see the work they set.  You see how they interact with the children. You meet them at school events like parents evening and discuss your child's progress.  You discuss school policy and the national curriculum with them. You see how they mark the work (ticking everything, even wrong answers doesn't cut the mustard). You see the work they put into topic setting and homework.  Is it just a print off from a website that doesn't match your child's KS level?  (had that happen a few times).  Does the child get appropriate feedback if they make mistakes?  I could go on.  If you don't think a wise parent can see which teachers are not good then you are wrong.  As it goes ALL my son's teachers bar 1 have been good.  2 in particular have been outstanding.  And not because they gave my son the best marks or anything so idiotic as that.  Its because of their knowledge, of their ability to actually help my son to learn and enjoy learning, of the work they put into homework and topics, of their ability to be able to discuss the national curriculum and school issues with you with confidence and knowledge...    That is what makes me such a good judge of a teacher.  Its in my best interests to judge as its about the education of my child. There's nothing much bigger than that as a parent.

true,WastedTruth,null,null,"&gt;the verb ""to be"" is special

my understanding - which may be incorrect or incomplete - is: it's not that the verb ""to be"" is special in and of itself, but that it's always intransitive, and therefore (like any other intransitive verb) it can never have a direct object, and therefore its subject complement (a predicate nominative, adjective or adverb - whatever its subject is ""be""'-ing) can never be in the accusative case - and *that* is why ""to be"" does indeed *always* use ""who"".

This means ""It is I"" is a technically correct answer to the question ""Who is it?"", and ""It is me"" is incorrect.

First of all there is the allegation that he broke UK law. The judge ruled correctly that he did. He was not being neutral. He was vetting people and ensuring the content of the links was what he wanted. He created a membership based website that wasn't just frequently used for, but it was designed for and exclusively for piracy. He made massive profits from it.

UK law would have protected him if he had created a website which had a different intention but people had been using it for piracy to some degree... at some point though it would be so overwhelmingly used for piracy it'd fall at the same hurdle as Newzbin.

The second issue is him being extradited to the US to face charges there. I do not really understand why this is the case. He is a criminal in the UK and should be tried as such here. The majority of the rights holders are probably in the US, but that doesn't matter does it?

Aside from all of that... there wouldn't be a need for these types of websites if we had decent IP laws that weren't draconian and anti-culture.

But seriously, when every episode is ""Oh shit there's a problem, but oh look a note from Amy from the future telling me exactly how to get out of this problem and letting me know that it's gonna be OK!"" I have a problem.  

You can see it in Moffat's early writing also, after girl in the fireplace almost every single episode he's written is a paradox.  Blink is a paradox, the library is one giant freaking paradox, as is all of River Song's story.

More to the point is it actually wrong to have a catalogue of links? That essentially takes bittorrent trackers (most of whom have advertising) down, which might seem fine, but what about something like google images? Google doesn't have the right to any of them, that search is entirely about finding images, google caches them and makes money with advertising on those pages...  

Realistically this is about going after the low hanging fruit in a way that's pretty awful, they aren't going after the sites with the actual content on, but the ones with links to it... does that actually make any sense?

I also note that you have things like sidreel, based in the US, doing the same thing, with gear in the US, seemingly protected by first amendment free speech type arguments.  I wouldn't pretend that this is about justice, because it isn't, whether it's something that's actually against the law in the US or UK is questionable at best (indeed SOPA is supposed to be about criminalising this kind of thing..).

true,Dugg,english,Lancashire,"&gt;He was making it from advertising though, that isn't exactly a surprising amount from a high volume site.

Advertising, Subscriptions, Donations, doesn't matter how he got that money, He still making a living of providing a CURATED site with link to ILLEGAL material.

&gt;That essentially takes bittorrent trackers (most of whom have advertising) down, which might seem fine, but what about something like google images? Google doesn't have the right to any of them, that search is entirely about finding images, google caches them and makes money with advertising on those pages...

Curated vs Automated. In the case of torrent trackers, sure theres many examples where its similar, but theres also plenty who respond to take down notices. From what I understand in this case he just didn't give a shit.

With Google, not sure whats legal and whats not, but website owners can tell Google to not index specific content.

&gt;Realistically this is about going after the low hanging fruit in a way that's pretty awful, they aren't going after the sites with the actual content on, but the ones with links to it... does that actually make any sense?

Agree It's awful, but what else can they do? They need to at least try and punish this person. They have already tried to simply take down the site - he could have walked away at this point.

and they're all very young players, so hopefully they'll be around for a while too. When one of those guys gets subbed off for a player like Lampard or Meireles, we lose something, as they lack the creativity or pace. Wouldn't we be better off replacing Lampard's spot in the squad not with a Lampard-esque player, but one more like Mata, Sturridge, or Ramires?

I've voiced this concern before, but to reiterate, we may have a lot of good midfielders right now, but we don't have the right combo. If we end up with a good XI for the 4-2-3-1, we still won't have the depth to properly sub players out. We would have to switch to a 4-3-3, or more realistically  with our current players, a 4-4-2.

true,ajehals,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;Advertising, Subscriptions, Donations, doesn't matter how he got that money, He still making a living of providing a CURATED site with link to ILLEGAL material.

But without actually breaking the law as it seemed at the time (and realistically how it stands).  linking to material isn't unlawful, you end up in a discussion about intent.  Running a site that promotes copyright infringement isn't unlawful, linking may be, but if it is we have a whole host of problems.

Again if you look at the scale of infringement you might assume that TV links was a massive issue, however in terms of real infringement I am certain that companies hosting material (clipart, audio, images, video clips etc..) internally and actually using them for profit (and to save money) in part because they don't understand the law and in part because it's easier than complying with it is a much bigger issue, but of course because it's muddy no one is going to try and deal with it yet.

&gt;With Google, not sure whats legal and whats not, but website owners can tell Google to not index specific content.

Google indexes the very sites that host the infringing content, search 'pirates of the Caribbean avi'  and you will find many links to sites that have one of the various movies available to stream or download directly, as well as a stack of torrents.  With images, given there is no fair use, I really can't see how google can, for example, index and cache most of my photographic works without consent on the basis that I haven't explicitly excluded them (and more to the point they link stuff that other sites have scraped too).  Sure I could sue them but I doubt I could get Larry Page extradited to the UK.

The law is the problem of course, I think we would agree on that, but the process is an issue too.  If linking is unlawful we have a real problem.

&gt;Agree It's awful, but what else can they do? They need to at least try and punish this person. They have already tried to simply take down the site - he could have walked away at this point.

Why do they need to punish him? He isn't hosting the material at all... Yes they took down his site, and he put it up again because as far as he was concerned (as far as opinion in the UK was and seemingly as the law is written, he hadn't broken any laws in the UK or the US..).

&gt;That's not for me to decided. But what I can tell you is that what he has done is, IMHO, morally abhorrent

Personally I'd say it was innovative, had he made a million pound's we would be hearing about licensing arguments and such not extradition. It isn't abhorrent to link to material on the web, it is illegal to take someone's work and distribute it without a license in the UK and the US, but even there it seems some people are more equal that others when it comes to enforcement (and that really is abhorrent).",0,1326487370,null,0,false,0,c3gwe3u,t3_ofi3g,t1_c3gwe3u,t1_c3gvu9r,null,1428174916,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I don't see a problem with using the real figures for how much it actually does spend on a yearly basis.

My point is that the Scottish government is going to spend every penny of whatever it receives in the block grant and we won't know what the natural expenditure of Scotland will be until we achieve independence. If Westminster sent us £600 Billion the government would still spend every penny, but you wouldn't say with a straight face that £600 Billion was the as low as the expenditure could be for Scotland. 


&gt;Scotland gets more down to a combination of the spread of its population, the poorer health of its population and the higher unemployment. I don't see how the SNP could change the former, and I'd love to see how they plan to address the latter two (they don't seem to have done much about it thus far). Addressing such complex social issues could hardly be done 'comfortably', and cutting spending so drastically would clearly cause a lot of pain.

Scotland has the lowest unemployment rate [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Labour-Market/TrendEconomicActivity] when compared with the rest of the UK and we have a government that will fight against attempts to privatise the Scottish NHS. We do have a spread out population so I do agree that for some parts of the Scotland do need to spend more per capita but I've not seen any evidence to suggest there is no room to reduce spending. Our income from oil will also increase when we reclaim part of our waters (labour changed the maritime boundary by 70 miles to make our oil income share look smaller than it is, the UK doesn't get to keep it when we separate) [image: http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?q=maritime+border+change+scotland&amp;hl=en&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;hs=YHp&amp;sa=X&amp;channel=cs&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=908&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbnid=IDh9RXEHp12KJM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2012/01/scotlandengland-maritime-boundaries/&amp;docid=D6xDWIRudE691M&amp;imgurl=http://craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/sea-grab.jpg&amp;w=550&amp;h=432&amp;ei=7JoQT-ipJoqB4ATAyc3TAw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=185&amp;vpy=154&amp;dur=307&amp;hovh=133&amp;hovw=167&amp;tx=198&amp;ty=68&amp;sig=105059093240016399461&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=133&amp;tbnw=167&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=32&amp;ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0]


&gt; The oil is already disappearing; some estimates have annual production down to a third of the peak of last decade by the end of this one. Its far too late to be fussing about a sovereign wealth fund, and even if it wasn't, it ignores the huge budget deficit/national debt Scotland would inherit by leaving the UK.

Yeah, we've been told that oil is going to run out 'soon' since the 70's but the oil companies are still investing large  sums of money. We have at least another few decades of oil and while they output isn't as high as it was in the 80's (where the money propped up the tory government at the time) the oil prices are increasing rapidly past the rate of inflation. The UK government has failed Scotland so far with it's management of our natural resources, time to get independence and be responsible for our own future and mistakes. 

&gt; Have you any idea how many wind farms would be required to not only meet Scotland's demand, but also export enough energy to make serious money? That grid is in place for the French over-supply of Nuclear power.

Yes, I know how many we need but we have no lack of free space and we are already building wind farms and infrastructure to support them. The super grid isn't actually built yet, its a series of sub project each one with a different set of goal. ISLES is designed specifically for renewable energy from places like Scotland and Ireland.

In the past and in the future

Throughout all time and space

There was a guy called ""Doctor""

With many a different face

He came from the planet Gallifrey

Where nothing changes in any way

He got really bored, needed a trip

So he found and old Type 40 and hotwired the ship

He faces cheesy monsters

Hot chicks, he can find

He has to face or fight them all

With no weapons, just his mind

And the ol' Doc can't control

Where his TARDIS decides to go

If he didn't land in dang'rous parts

We wouldn't have a show

Companion roll call:

Martha! Donna! Romana! Rooooooose!

You wonder how his ship's so big

Inside that ""Police Box"" shack?

Repeat to yourself ""it's a well-known show,

Arteta arrived at a similar age and at a similar price, having failed to establish himself anywhere other than at Rangers, where he was playing for a strong team in a comparatively poor league. I'm not saying he is the new Arteta by any means, but the guy already has Champions League and Premier League experience, and with a bit of Moyes' polish maybe we could have a real gem on our hands? Gibson doesn't have Arteta's Barcelona DNA, but even looking at other players who have thrived under Moyes, such as Baines, Pienaar, Jags and Lescott, it could work out well for us.

Overall, something pleasant to come out of this window at least, though nothing to get terribly excited over just yet.

Liverpool are erratic, and Kenny is a bit mad with tactics at times. I can see our midfield tearing them to shreds. Suarez is out, and Andy Carroll is just a white Emile Heskey. Liverpool are one of those teams I expect us to counter effectively.

Busquets had it coming, really. He dives for the slightest of touches (and often when there is no touch at all).

---

It's not that I think Barcelona is a bad team or so, but just that I'm so sick of the fact that *everyone* (friends, neighbours, colleagues, the press) praises them so much. Sure, they've won the Champions League a few times, and yes they are a good team (even if they ought to spend quite a bit less time diving and appealing for free kicks).

The Ballon d'Or is worth shit nowadays, with 9 out of 25 the nominated players being from Barcelona. And of course Messi got the award, as usual. I don't think Messi's anything special, sure he is a good footballer, but he isn't spectacular or anything extra for me. I honestly think that Ronaldo is a better player than Messi.

I'm not sure that you know much about Zlatan Ibrahimovic, but here in Sweden we get to hear a lot of/about/from him. He ""recently"" (quarter of a year-ish) published a book where he describes the relationship between himself and Pep Guardiola. There was much talk about it in the press when Ibrahimovic changed club to Milan and when the chilly relationship between him and the Barcelona manager became apparent. According to an out-take from Ibrahimovic's book it was Messi who one day went into Guardiola's office and requested to be played up front instead of in the middle - which forced Ibrahimovic to make place for him. So I dislike him for that as well, as I like Ibrahimovic.

In Blink, the Doctor knows what Sally Sparrow says in the conversation because he has the transcript. He has the transcript because Sally gave it to him. Sally had the transcript because she had the conversation already. She was able to have the conversation already because the Doctor (when recording the video) knew what she would say in the conversation. Repeat from beginning. This is a catch-22.

I think the transition from Doctor Who to a more ""adult"" series was a little hard to pull off, but the second series was better. The third series, Children of Earth, was phenomenal on almost every level, and the Miracle Day series, series four, is also highly recommended. 

I think RTD really hit his stride with Torchwood and the COE series -- it's a well-written. sharp, intelligent, and adult story arc, as is Miracle Day, and I think the series works better when it has a definitive arc, rather than the one-off episodes of series one and two, which felt disjointed and sort of haphazard. 

However, if you can make it through the first few episodes of series one, by the time you get to ""They Keep Killing Susie,"" it starts to pick up steam and the characters become less caricature and it definitely improves from there.

As for the Sarah Jane Adventures, I've only seen series one and the few episodes where the Doctor has appeared, so I don't feel like I'm really qualified to say.

One thing to remember is that SJA is way more kid friendly than Doctor Who. It mostly follows a group of the teenaged friends of the boy Sarah Jane adopts as they help her fight alien threats. It can be a bit cheesy sometimes to an adult audience.

Torchwood divides a lot of fans, but I enjoy it. It's definitely darker than Doctor Who, as it's more adult oriented, which means more sexual related content and occasional swear words that they couldn't get away with on Doctor Who.

true,swinegums,flair7,,"I know, my reaction is just knee jerk ""we have it good, let's not upset the apple cart"". I also can't see Defoe going to a club better than Spurs (although I'm probably wrong there as well). What do you think Defoe would fetch if he moved on, and where would his likely destinations be?

Damiao seems to be out of our price range now. I don't know enough about Doumbia but his goal scoring stats are good - in Switzerland and Russia. Would he cut it in the Premiership? I don't know. And Remy is vital for Marseille if they are going to make it into the CL spots so what are the odds on us getting him? I honestly don't know the answer to any of those questions.

To be honest, I've been completely left behind by Spurs dealings in the transfer market in the last couple of windows, with the only signing I've correctly called/wished for being Scott Parker. I would have got rid of Defoe before the start of the season and he's chipped in with vital goals. After the Adebayor and Rafa coups I jut need to sit on my hands, shut up and trust that Harry and Levy know what they're about.

I guess I just wish that Defoe would be happy to be in a team that's challenging for the title, even if that means he's part of a rotation system. He is going to get game time, and if he was willing to shut up, get on with it and carry on scoring he might even have a league winners medal to show for it.

true,imperator_librarius,smith,Smith,"I love Captain Jack to bits, but I could never totally get behind Torchwood. The heroine/fish-out-of-water/audience stand-in (Gwen) vacillated between being a shallow, selfish, idiot and a badass in a way that felt driven entirely the needs of the plot, not the needs of her character. She is (in my opinion) the least likable and relate-able of the entire team, yet gets most of the screen time. She does improve some in Children of Earth, though.

I felt like a lot of the writing in Torchwood felt very much like someone looked at it and was like ""Alright, aliens, good, I like it, but could we have some more *sex*? Just, you know, sex, it doesn't need to actually make sense character-wise, we just need everybody fucking. *Constantly*."" I wouldn't call myself a prude by any stretch, and it wasn't so much the fact that there was sex, just that it often felt forced. I will buy Jack slipping his junk into anything that breathes, because that's been part of his character from the moment he appeared onscreen in Dr. Who. The rest of the cast, less so.

Children of Earth, however, I *did* enjoy—if the process of being emotionally destroyed can be considered to elicit joy. The length allows it to move at a delicious slow burn, and develop wonderful amounts of tension, dread, and mystery. If the rest of the series had been more like Children of Earth, I would be singing its praises from the mountaintops. That isn't to say CoE is perfect—it has a number of missteps to be sure—but the quality of, well, *everything*, is far above the rest of Torchwood, in my humble opinion, and its depiction of extraterrestrial contact and its effect on Earth society is one of the best I've ever seen.

SPOILERS AHEAD

I really liked the format of the first two seasons. Children of Earth and Miracle Day just took themselves too seriously, and the show just stopped being fun. Plus, they were dealing with things that the Doctor obviously should have been involved with. So a race of aliens shows up and wants to use the earth's children as crack? The Doctor would have sorted that out in a half hour. Where was he? Gwen even mentions it, but we never really get a good answer.

Killing off Owen was fine, because I'm not sure what else they were going to do with his character after turning him into a zombie. But they should have let Tosh live and brought in Martha as a the new medical officer for season 3 and made her a regular member of the cast. Then they could have even brought in Mickey for a few episodes. Say what you will about Mickey, but he always brings the fun.

Killing off Ianto was just the final straw. They killed off too many main characters, which is why they had to make Rhys, Gwen's parents and Mekhi Phifer main characters. I like Jack and Gwen, but imagine if the A-Team had killed off Baracus and Murdock and replaced them with Face's parents. It just doesn't work.

It's also very necessary, this is delegacy not representation remember, we're not seeking a permanent professional political class - indeed that's exactly what we want to avoid.  If it becomes clear that a permanent bureaucracy is inevitable then it would have to be unionised and organised along syndicalist lines like any other 'industry'.

&gt;What you describe is a government though, and it's a conceit. What you really mean is a government unlike any that exist just now, actually formed in the way that most claim to be.

At one level yes, though clearly unlike any which exist at a national level anywhere today.  It's not ""a government"" in the sense of a hierarchically organised monopoly user of force for one class against another, it's a self-organising hierarchicless ultra-democratic system.

&gt;as the Americans put it ""by the people for the people""

Although they never came particularly close to this ideal, because, whilst people like Paine spoke a lot of Common Sense (;-)), those who devised the system were slave-owning, property owning elitists who only thought in terms of democratising the political realm but never gave a single moment's thought to democratising the economic realm.

Notice how, when modern Americans (and Brits for that matter) consider Rome, for the vast majority it is the aristocratic, slave-owning, debt-ridden, imperialist Republic they worship.  Brutus - the slum landlord - is hero; Caesar is an evil despot, and so with all the [populares](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populares) (assuming they're educated enough to know he followed in a long tradition of murdered aristocrats who actually practised what they preached in shifting power and wealth towards the people).  Who ever talks of the [Gracchi brothers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracchi) these days?

I've said before that Greek style democracy by sortition is about the most democratic form of government historically seen.  Of course, in its original context it was problematic because it only related to male citizens, and it's not without its flaws and problems, but it was far superior to the system we have in the UK today.  But ultimately, this still only represents a better form of democracy in the political realm, and without democracy in the economic realm, it doesn't come close to anarchism.

Would be interested to get your take on who you think we might sign in January, and whether Pav/Defoe might leave. Personally Jones at 5million sounds like a steal - he's still only 27 and while he's never fulfilled his potential he could play a role if he was ok with being a squad player (and no reason that he wouldn't be as Spurs are a bigger club than anything he's been at before - but I don't know much about his work ethic, application etc).

I think I'm biased about Zamora because of his time with us before. Do you remember how many goals he scored for Brighton before he signed for Spurs? He was on fire for a long time, and then just lost his way completely after the move. So much expectation, some little flashes, but nothing else. He's a totally different player now and I can see why you describe him as excellent, but I can't help feeling he's found his level at Fulham and he'd get lost again at Spurs. As I said, probably totally unfair bias. Also, how much would Fulham want for him?

3) maybe you could include a cord rapped around your hands in the ceremony like River and the doctor did
4) paper fezzes for the funnier part of the party

I'll add more if they come to my mind :-)

Rafa, despite being probably the most tactically astute manager we've ever had, didn't know how to fix it. We'd gone beyond ""a few good results will sort us out"" and things were looking bleak. Like most of us I thought Rafa would turn it around the following season but wasn't altogether shocked when he went. Hodgson did nothing to address the problem of course but the whole episode led us to where we are now. Kenny back at the helm feels *right*, he might be the only person who can fix that lack of belief that seems to haunt some of the players.

true,Dugg,english,Lancashire,"&gt; you end up in a discussion about intent.

Theres nothing wrong with selling axes, but if you sell with the intent that It's going to end up being used in a murder. It's illegal. 
In the same way here, having a link is not 'illegal', having a CURATED index of links to copyrighted material becomes an assist in copyright infringement. The intent all along is to provide illegal material.

&gt;companies hosting material (clipart, audio, images, video clips etc..) internally and actually using them for profit

Examples? I don't believe any legitimate company would knowingly 'steal' material and use them for profit.

&gt;search 'pirates of the Caribbean avi' and you will find many links to sites that have one of the various movies available to stream or download directly

Firstly this is an automated process. Secondly, Googles business model is not to make a profit from indexing illegal material.

&gt; index and cache most of my photographic works without consent on the basis that I haven't explicitly excluded them

Indexed and cached images are only thumbnails and link directly to the source.

&gt;Why do they need to punish him?

Assisting and profiting from copyright infringement on a fairly large scale.

&gt;Personally I'd say it was innovative, had he made a million pound's we would be hearing about licensing arguments and such not extradition.

It could have been that way. After the first take down he basically said 'fuck you' and put it up again. A legitimate business would have ceased and/or attempted to become legal after legal advice.

&gt;It isn't abhorrent to link to material on the web

TVShack was more than just 'a link'.

All alleged misconduct occurred in the UK yet no criminal charges have followed from UK authorities. This leads me to believe that he should not be extradited because he broke copyright laws in another country, the USA has many laws which are different to those in the UK, it is possible that I could adhere completely to UK law yet not be following laws in the USA. I do not think UK citizens should have to follow US law, nor should they be punished and extradited if they do not.

true,johnyma22,,BD15,"Driving in Bradford is a joke.  It really is.  I try to avoid it whenever possible.

I once drove in Casablanca (Morocco) and it's not dissimilar.  

It feels like one in ten drivers is in a huge rush to get somewhere yet as a city we don't seem to do very much.  I once had a guy nearly pull into the side of me and when I pulled up next to him and asked him ""Hey man?  How come you nearly took me out?"" He said he had been fasting that day and wanted to get home to eat.  Now it's cool that he's hungry and I can completely empathize with his situation but he placed a lot of lives in danger just to get home to eat..  I mean..  Really?  Wife is giving birth, yes.  Dog is dying, just about..  But I'm hungry ergo I'm going to do thousands of pounds worth of damage...

Bradford would be a great place to introduce autonomous transport, they would have to learn quickly how to deal with hazards, the majority of which are created by poor public service (Burst water mains, stupid bus lanes) and also suicidal drivers.

The real beef insurance companies have is the # of uninsured drivers (I don't know many of these people).  I think I have met 2 or 3 people my entire life that drove without insurance and they are the same people that drink drive and are general fucking morons.  We don't do much as a society to support these people.  

Putting insurance prices up will actually worsen the problem of uninsured drivers so essentially we are on a downward spiral unless we make a stand.  The council wouldn't go far wrong at enlightening some of our drivers that they are driving badly, either through a social incentive or a reward mechanism.  What the council shouldn't do (Yet it probably will) is put in place more policing and speed cameras as any punishment mechanism will only compound the problem.

Just as a side note.  An acquaintance of mine got knocked down outside of Salty's in a hit and run 3 days ago.  Fucking hit and run, in Wibsey...  This shit needs to stop, she is only 16 and &lt; 5ft tall.

I really don't see why we needed 5 in the back today. Aside from Etherington, Stoke were not dangerous at all. I thought we needed to get a center half off after the interval. 


Against a team like Stoke, who were clearly parking the bus, we needed a tactical approach to stretch their back line. We needed players running in behind and in the channels. We needed wide players to get beyond fullbacks and pull center halves out of position. Instead, we decided to try and pound it down their throats. They responded by packing three midfielders in front of their center halves. We didn't have a chance today to be honest, playing the way we did.

true,busstopboxer,null,null,"Yeah, the idea of getting Jones for such a low fee seems crazy, but it does look like he could be available. He'd be a great alternative to Adebayor. There have been some rumours of a poor attitude/work ethic, but nothing conclusive. Redknapp knows him, supposedly likes him, and I think he could do a good job of taking him to the next level.

On Zamora, I know his last spell with us was disappointing, but don't forget he was only with us for half a season before being bundled into the deal that brought Defoe in from West Ham. He'd never played top flight football before and he could definitely have done with being given more of a chance. If we're looking for a low cost option I think he's one of the better we could get, though I'd be after Jones or Gignac first.

Having said all that, I've had a bit of a rethink since we were discussing it last. I now think we should look for a more expensive, first XI quality striker. We're doing so well I think it's worth the risk, as it would make all the difference in the CL next year. If we somehow bomb in the second half of the season and miss CL qualification we'll just have to let Adebayor go in the summer.

So I think my main targets would be Cisse, Sow and Damaio, though I think you might be right about the ship having sailed on the latter. Cisse looks like being the easiest to sign given Freiburg's season so far. I think both him and Sow look like real quality forwards, 26 and 25 I think, so really coming into their prime, and both strong, quick all-rounders with a track record of consistent good finishing. I think they're both quite similar in style to Ba but without the injury worries. Would love either of them.

I really like Doumbia and Remy too, but I have some slight concerns about their back-to-goal play, the ability to bring our midfield into the game - they're a bit more light weight than the others mentioned. I really haven't seen enough to properly judge though to be honest, and I'd be happy to have either, particularly Doumbia.

I alsk don't think the French and Russian leagues are too bad actually, and both have played CL football this year, with Doumbia particularly impressive.

Obviously there are other players out there who'd be great, your Hulks, your Cavanis and what not, but I think the one's mentioned are realistic targets with real potential to be top class.

On players leaving, I hope we keep hold of Defoe and think we probably will, at least until the summer. Pav should be off - there's been mention of CSKA being interested, which could tie it into a Doumbia deal. Only problem is likely to be Levy playing hardball on the price, and given I suspect we won't sign a new forward until Pav is out, I really hope we're prepared to take a bit of a loss on him.

I think Defoe will likely push for a transfer in the summer though, almost certainly if we bring in another big name forward who pushes him down the pecking order. Fair enough if he wants to play football. Bring in Jones in the summer to reolace him and I'll be very happy.

Sorry, realise I'm rambling on a bit here. Last point is I'd like us to look at Moses too. Young, very quick forward who can play wide on either side - Hoilett's been linked a lot recently, and he is good, but I'd be going with Moses. Same age, about the same fee I think. Our current back up wide/attacking players are all a bit short on pace, so I'd be looking to find a home for Dos Santos so we could make this move.

The whole debate about the ethical rights and wrongs is pointless. The system doesn't work and most likely never will. Effectively the government is attempting to do identity via injective biological hashing. Injective hashing is difficult to achieve in idealised conditions. It makes about as much sense as telling us they are going to solve the energy crisis with a perpetual motion machine.

In short the biometrics become a side issue. What we have is a passport with a potentially unethical and absolutely expensive biological boondongle attached to it.

*when used as a lock the way it works is they loosen requirements until the false negative rate drops to near 0. Then the false positive rate goes up to 20%. Used for identity the requirements would need to be tightened until a near 0 false positive result is found. At this level you get a 30% false negative rate.

I think you are arguing semantics. Perhaps I was saying that it is simply due to the existance of these street names that we are 'made of win.'  Whether they still exist or not today is irrelevent, as the fact they were there at any point of time makes us 'awesome.' Think about it, you are trying too hard.


A joke can be a statement, a joke doesn't have to be funny. That is like saying a 'Plan has to work for it to be plan' which is obviously not true. Again, semantics.

Quite mistakenly too, I would suggest. The suggestion of a maintained pay freeze during the epic amount of inflation going on will slowly be eroding living standards for public sector workers. The ultimate long-term risks will be how 'competitive' wages in the private sector will become against the public sector. The longer the freeze goes on, the less incentive anyone will have to work in the public sector which may risk the provision of services.

Not to mention though, Labour isn't in any position to do a damn thing about public sector pay freezes during this parliament. They aren't in power and they can complain all they want, it won't help them as there's a united majority against them. It's a very bad move on the part of Labour though to commit themselves to every decision made right now if they win the next election.

More and more they seem to be forgetting their roots. Yes, there's expenses involved, but you do not commit yourself to a pay freeze in 2015 or to merely 'reviewing' the pay freeze in 2015 when you have 3 years before the election.
