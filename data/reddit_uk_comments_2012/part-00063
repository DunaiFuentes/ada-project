Every now and then, he's given a good scene and really goes to town on it.  (The Stonehenge speech, for example.)  The problem is that the writing is all over the place.  He is really just **unbelievably** stupid at times, because of the writers' fixation on making him some sort of alien man-child.

(I won't post a spoiler, but I'll just say that the most recent Christmas special is an excellent example.)

I keep holding out hope that he starts turning into more of a puppetmaster, sort of like #2 and especially #7, using his innocent charm as a mask for more devious intentions.  There've been hints of this in certain eps, but then it gets swept under the rug again in favor of a scene where he doesn't even know basic football terminology.  

I don't think the writers have a strong vision in mind for what his character is, and I think that makes his performance suffer a lot.  I'd honestly love to see what Smith could do in the hands of better writers, but I have a suspicion he'll be leaving whenever Moffat does, as happened on the last changeover.  (I could be wrong.)

&gt; Well, if it did work, it would be a valid answer as I'm not trying to provide the best or most efficient way of doing something.

I specifically asked for **secure** solutions. You've just provided an insecure solution.

&gt; And what is your reason for saying that it is insecure and how is it any less secure than saving the session id to dis

Because by putting the session id into the url it means any one monitoring your web usage (from your company IT manager to the IT monkey watching the proxy logs at your ISP) can hijack your session by just loading one of the urls they see you accessing. Or someone looking over your shoulder at your broswer address bar just needs to copy the session id that's displayed there. Also anyone sharing a computer, just closing the browser will no longer kill a session that you've chosen not to have remembered. These make it incredibly easy to access someone's session. Therefore is terribly insecure.

&gt; Also, security isn't essential to a website, it's essential to some websites which deal with information that needs to be kept secure. If you just want to display some static text, what security considerations need to be taken into account?

Oh come one, you know the context of this dicussion. Websites where cookies are deemed essential. Examples I've already given are those that require login or ecommerce sites, so I'm obviously not talking about static websites. I'm starting to think you're just a bored troll.

&gt; &gt; Also you don't need to remain logged in to a site?

&gt; Of course you don't. Unless you actually want your room mates making comments for you. Like I said earlier, some people consider persistent sessions a security flaw.

I'm talking about remaining logged in between page views. Unless you propose having people login to every page they access. Your proposed insecure solution is not a viable alternative.

&gt; &gt; You want to log in every time you hit the voting buttons on reddit?

&gt; No, but why would you need to given that you have a non-cookie based session?

Reddit doesn't have a non-cookie based session. It uses cookies. And as I showed above your proposed solution is ridiculously insecure.",0,1338102641,null,0,false,0,c4suu1d,t3_u62om,t1_c4suu1d,t1_c4ssgcn,null,1429008896,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,92wasagoodyear,null,null,"&gt;You do realize England is one of the only places in the world where people believe that, right? Nowhere else in the world do people argue that self-defense isn't an inherent human right.

I’m not saying that self-defence is not a human right. I am questioning however that if you need a gun for self-defence where the hell are you living? Say you carry a gun as a pre-emptive measure for self-defence but that would mean that you have people actively trying to shoot you or kill you. If that was the case then you would have a police escort anyway. 

&gt;I carry a gun daily and I don't intend to use it.

Then why carry it?  if you are taking a gun around and showing it off then you are asking for trouble and even worse you are making people uneasy because if you are carrying a gun there must be a reason for it. People should actively distance themselves from you because most  likely to get shot are the people not even involved in the gunfight.

&gt;I'm not just talking about alcohol poisoning... also consider drunk drivers who kill people or those who assault others while drunk.

Again like most drugs alcohol has a range of secondary effects and sure drink driving causes deaths but speeding  cause more deaths then alcohol. Assault can happen while drunk but as you will be inebriate, you will be sluggish. Again, the police's advice is to leave the area. They cannot hurt you if you are not there also if guns were less regulated think of all the deaths that could happen when drunk people attack. 

You may feel in the right Pizza401 but you have to admit that if the UK had the same gun laws as the US then from what I’ve stated early there would be 1800 death in the UK by gun crime. Just because other things cause more death does not mean we should lessen controls on other dangerous items.

Nothing is 100% secure. But cookies are much more secure than your solution.

There is a major difference between needing access to a PC or just being able to pluck an ID from someone's screen or access logs.

Cookies are currently the most secure way of providing session. Security is essential to a website that requires sessions, sessions are essential functionality for many websites. Therefore cookies are essential for providing that functionality.

Proposing a worse solution just because the best one isn't 100% is ridiculous. Door locks are not 100% secure, but would you propose using sticky tape as a viable alternative?

&gt; I do, but you don't seem to. The discussion is about cookies providing essential functionality for websites. It's a well known fact that sessions can be implemented without cookies. So what about e-commerce sites requires cookies? I guarantee you anything that you can implement with cookies, can be implemented without cookies as well.

You seem to be missing the fundamental point. Security is essential to such websites, so you don't want to use a less secure method for providing sessions. Therefore cookies are essential. In the future a more secure method may come along and as soon as every browser supports it then cookies won't be essential, until then they are.

In the future a more secure method may come along and as soon as every browser supports it then cookies won't be essential, until then they are.

Cookies are not essential for sessions. This is a proven fact. You can insist that they are all you want, but I've provided you with 2 alternative methods so far. How is using a session cookie any safer than writing the session id directly to the web page?

&gt;Well then you should be able to provide me a couple of links to websites that use this.

Sites that use it? Do you have a time machine handy? You'll find plenty of info about them on google though. Google [url based sessions](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=url+based+sessions).

I ignored it because it's irrelevent. Your logic was flawed which is what I was pointing out. Also, I'm not a web developer, I'm an assembly language programmer.

&gt;Oh my god. Writing a session id directly to a web page is only half the solution (as I already said) you need to then send it back to the server.

Which is extremely trivial, like I already said.

&gt;You suggest putting the ID in the url, that is insecure (as I already said). You seem to be completely ignoring everything I've said about the importance security.

No I don't, that was a completely seperate solution. I suggested reading the session id from the page then making a request using that data. Pretty much the exact same way cookies work, only instead of reading from a cookie, you're reading from the web page itself.

&gt;Nice one. The first result that google provides is a link to ""URL-based session is insecure and so is JavaBlogs.com"", I suggest you read it. Of course I've heard of them, but thanks for the subtle insult, I know about them and I know how insecure they are. Which is why no one who knows what they are doing would ever consider using them.

You seem to think that I'm advocating url based sessions. I'm not. I'm simply stating that alternative methods exist, therefore cookie based sessions can't possibly be essential. You asked for an alternative method and that's what I provided.

Like I keep saying, it's a well known fact that cookies are not the only way of implementing sessions. You now appear to grudgingly agree with this fact and with my later comment that there's pretty much always more than one way to do things, but still will not admit that session cookies are not essential, which is completely illogical. HTML is essential, cookies are not. Neither is javascript and flash most certainly isn't.

Perhaps you don't understand the definition of essential?

It's not irrelevant. It just screws with your argument. I can safely say I know as much about assembly as you do about the web.

&gt; No I don't, that was a completely seperate solution. I suggested reading the session id from the page then making a request using that data. Pretty much the exact same way cookies work, only instead of reading from a cookie, you're reading from the web page itself.

Great, except reading from the cookie is handled automatically by the browser. The only way this would work is for the session id to be stored exactly the same way in each web page. Also browsers would need to support it, so this is not a solution that could currently work without support added to every browser. Also you now have your session ID in every cached webpage on your PC. So what exactly have you achieved? 

Storing it in a webpage is a stupid idea, it wouldn't work with ajax for instance. So my suggestion would be to store a session ID in the http response headers. But still you'd need to update all browsers to support it.

Flaws with these solutions are that if you browse away from the site you are on you lose your session. I'm sure there are others but I can't really be bothered.

&gt; Like I keep saying, it's a well known fact that cookies are not the only way of implementing sessions. You now appear to grudgingly agree with this fact.

I never disagreed with this. My point is about security of sessions. Currently cookies are the best solution to securely store sessions, this makes them essential.

&gt; HTML is essential, cookies are not. Neither is javascript and flash most certainly isn't.

If you don't see that javascript is now essential to modern websites then there's little point continuing this.

If the web really worked the way you believe it does we'd still be using mosaic and http auth. Thankfully the people building today's websites have far more vision.

I said that security is essential, therefore using the currently most secure method for session supported by all browsers is essential. If you don't agree that this is cookies then please tell me what it is. But is is certainly not Url based session.

I'm listening, I'm just choosing to ignore it because it is irrelevent to my argument. My argument is that cookies do not provide any essential functionality and any functionality they do provide, can be provided using different methods.

&gt;Err, as I said before (a few times), this is only half the solution. It provides the session ID to the client. The client still needs to send it to the server so they can be identified.

How do you read and use the data from a cookie?

&gt;You have only provided one method for doing this, putting the session in the url. As I've already said this is so insanely insecure it's laughable.

You said that, not me. I said the session id would be provided to the server in the same way it is provided from a cookie.

Gun control is not attempting to civilize the populace, but to grant it safety (that aside, I think you could make a reasonably strong argument that Rome (The Colosseum is not Greek) had, in aggregate, a more civilized society, albeit less advanced).

Guns were designed from their inception to do exactly what you are claiming they prevent - the reason guns won out against bows in medieval Europe is not because guns were more effective. They were hard to maintain, prone to deadly faults, near-useless in rain, noisy and hopelessly inaccurate. Bows win on every category. 

The only advantage guns had is that they required extremely limited training - you don't need twelve years of practice on the Welsh mountainsides to fire one. You pick it up, point it, and pull the trigger. Anyone can do it.

Nowadays, guns have mitigated all of these problems, but one central strand remains: anyone can use a gun. They don't need training, or expertise. They can't be defended against effectively. Literally anyone, by picking up a gun, becomes a huge danger. 

Without guns, the number of people who are dangerous dramatically decreases - swords and knives are really hard to use effectively, very few are strong and practiced enough to harm others, without a weapon, with impunity. 

Your examples are purposefully emotive, and can easily be reversed. Controlling guns keeps more people safer. That is a good reason to control them.",0,1338113418,null,0,false,0,c4svpl4,t3_u5q0r,t1_c4svpl4,t1_c4ss32a,null,1429009310,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","Actually, I can think of two cases where legal tender applies in my day to day life:

 1. When I buy fuel for my car; I pump fuel, creating a debt to the fuel station, then go to pay for it.

 2. When I eat in a restaurant; the bill is presented after I eat, but the debt is created when I eat the food I've ordered.

Those are the only two I can think of - everything else I do day-to-day (like buying food in the supermarket) sets up a situation where I can fail to take the goods (e.g. leave them at the checkout) and thus fail to create the debt in the first place, making legal tender an irrelevance.

There's also the side point that legal tender rules are meant as an absolute last line of defence against an unreasonable creditor who's trying to make you pay your debt in a manner that you consider impractical (e.g. a creditor who wants to convert an £100 debt from a plumber into 10 hours free plumbing, or a creditor who wants you to pay them in pre-1990 1p and 2p pieces). 

Practically speaking, although the law prohibits a creditor from chasing you for a debt that's been paid in legal tender, a court would also prevent a creditor chasing you for a debt paid by cheque, or by direct bank transfer, or other means that make it clear that it's the creditor being unreasonable in not accepting your money, not you refusing to pay.",0,1338115776,null,0,false,0,c4svv99,t3_u61kd,t1_c4svv99,t1_c4sm7eu,null,1429009391,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,crazylilting,welsh,Wales,"... here we go again.  The article states that activists say it is unsafe, yet it doesn't say that scientists say it is safe.  wording it in a way that puts the Activists in a position of having to defend something they do not have to defend at all.  The research thus far has not done enough study on the safety of this product.  They even assert that non of the crop will be used for food or animal feed negating the need to actually do any safety tests.  I've read the papers they submitted to the government for a grant and they breifly talk about safety by asserting that the gene they use is already in nature, but do not talk about how much of it they are using in comparison to what is naturally found in nature....

The article also points out that activists have benefited from lotto money while not talking about how much we have given to to Rothamsted agricultural research centre for studying something in the wild that they are only wanting to test the behaviour of the gene in the wild...  Test the behaviour?  WTF does that mean?  I'll tell you what it means, they have no idea how this gene will behave so they thought they would stick it in the wild and test it.

The simple fact that any GMO pundit cannot refute is that the horizontal transfer of miRNA from plants to other organisms is not only possible but has been found in humans so they will point to the shady studies that were done on the horizontal transfer of DNA from plants to animals.  That's like saying if i eat a cow I won't turn into a cow.  Of course DNA transfer isn't possible....

This is all smokes and mirrors to gain positive public opinion to justify the need to spend more of our tax payers money on studying and protecting this industry.  If the Police had any sense at all they would join in and burn it with the Activists that want to destroy this dangerous technology.

&gt;The simple fact that any GMO pundit cannot refute is that the horizontal transfer of miRNA from plants to other organisms is not only possible but has been found in humans so they will point to the shady studies that were done on the horizontal transfer of DNA from plants to animals. That's like saying if i eat a cow I won't turn into a cow. Of course DNA transfer isn't possible....

miRNA? Like the miRNA found in every single plant or animal that you eat? GM or not? Do you know what miRNA is or how it functions? 

Don't tell me, this wheat has genes in it and normal wheat doesnt? Or does that just apply to tomatoes? 

&gt;This is all smokes and mirrors to gain positive public opinion to justify the need to spend more of our tax payers money on studying and protecting this industry. If the Police had any sense at all they would join in and burn it with the Activists that want to destroy this dangerous technology.

A quarter of that grant has had to be spent on security to protect the plant from nutters like you.  I make no apology for using the nutter word  against you because quite frankly you are one and it is reflected in every one of your posts.

As for my favourite review:

&gt;*I bought this toy for my son, and he initially seemed quite pleased with it. However, one day he asked me how much the Olympics cost, and I told him that it'd be upwards of £10bn. He commented, 'that's really expensive!' I was about to agree when the figurine produced a water cannon and blasted my son into a wall. He then proceeded to pelt my son with baton rounds while screaming 'HOW DARE YOU INSULT THE SANCTITY OF OUR GLORIOUS OLYMPICS?'*

&gt;*At this point my son was quite dead, and I was understandably upset. Adrian Chiles then came into my living room and started berating my dead son for daring to question the Olympics. It's my understanding that the figurine also filmed all this with his camera eye.*

&gt;*Despite all this the protective case adds a touch of class and the mascot had provided for hours of fun before.*

&gt;*In conclusion I cannot recommend this product as it kills children and summons Adrian Chiles.*",0,1338122520,null,0,false,0,c4swbup,t3_u75r1,t1_c4swbup,t3_u75r1,null,1429009601,95,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,95

To be fair though we did respectably last year with Blue and it was probably the best song we've entered in quite a while. The Engelbert song was bland, the musical equivalent of beige. It was one of the least memorable songs of the evening (plus it came on first so it was overshadowed and forgotten by the end).

true,Limes19,Churchill,Churchill,"We've all got exams on at the moment too, so that's probably why you've not had many replies yet (however, reddit makes for good procrastination!).

Sounds like your academic record is certainly good, and that's the main thing that is looked for. However you'll also need to show interest/passion for your subject - a really easy way you can do this is by reading around the subject a lot. I don't necessarily mean textbooks here, but general interest titles would certainly go a long way if you mention that you've read them in your personal statement. For example, I'm a physicist, and I seem to remember mentioning that I'd had a look at the Feynman lectures, and several pop science books (can't remember exact titles, but you're not applying for Physics so it doesn't matter). See if you can find any of the recommended books for first year Economics students on the Cambridge uni website as well. Otherwise, stay up to date on current affairs as well - I imagine this would be very important for Economics, especially in the current climate, and probably something to think about at the interview stage. Perhaps you could consider trying to find some sort of lecture open to the public that you could attend that is relevant to economics, for example http://www.ted.com/ .

The main point to consider is there is no ""magic checklist"" of particular activities that the admissions people are going to be scoring you against. You're not going to be turned away for not having read a particular book/article, not having attended a particular activity, or not having seen a particular public lecture. You need to *generally* show that you're intelligent, that you'll be able and willing to be taught if you get in, and that you're *genuinely interested* enough in the subject to stay focussed on it through three years of demanding study. So use your imagination! If you're taking time out of your life away from school to pursue your subject, you can't really go too far wrong.

One more brief point - Cambridge is a bit different from a lot of other universities in that the admissions people don't really care so much about other extra-curricular activities. It's almost certainly good to have other hobbies outside of school, but don't take on twenty different sports or clubs and let your studies suffer as a result.

Lets get something straight right here and right now.  You can't say something is rubbish without proving it not to be.  Prove that this product is safe or shut up.  There have been no significant tests of it's safety at all unless they haven't been released.  So if you want to submit proof that these products are safe with a peer reviewed study please do so, or don't reply again.  I have read every single study produced on the subject that i can get my hands on, and even other studies that are.

&gt;miRNA? Like the miRNA found in every single plant or animal that you eat? GM or not? Do you know what miRNA is or how it functions? 

Absolutely, do you?  Do you realize how stupid you are making yourself sound right now?  If you are asking this question, you already know that miRNA of gm and non-gmo plants transfers to humans and is the basis of the next generation of GMO's.  It is the smoking gun that will prove that Geneticists have been lying about the effects of the products they create.  I dare you to dig your hole deeper by making this more mainstream.  Go on.

I am aware that a quarter of the money has been spent on security, that should say something about gmo's not make a case for public support.  You may call me a nutter, but let me tell you something right now, back up your comments with real scientific proof this product is safe or stop trying to make yourself look smarter then me because you simply are not.

Here's what you need to provide:

The studies that conclusively prove that the new gene expression in the wheat is safe for human and animal consumption.  This means a study of how the miRNA interacts with humans and animals.

Justify how studying a product not widely used in the UK will benifit tax payers.

Explain how lying about the safety of the product means we should spend more tax payers money protecting it.

I have read every single study produced on the subject that i can get my hands on, and even other studies that are.

You cannot prove a negative, how many more time do you have to be told? Prove to me this technology is dangerous? I suspect you have not read anywhere near enough papers on the subject. 

&gt;Absolutely

Go on then indulge me, explain some of the functions of miRNA? Then tell me why transference, real or hypothetical of plant/animal miRNA to human cells is or could be detrimental? Also tell me how this miRNA of this wheat has anything to do with the gene expressed in it? 

&gt;Do you realize how stupid you are making yourself sound right now?

Look at the upvotes/downvotes of our respective posts. I think that speaks for itself. And your comments on miRNA should have biologists going 'WTF?

&gt; next generation of GMO's. 

I would love to meet a geneticist that can get only miRNA transferred and expressed in a plant, and make it effective to ward off pests that would be some mean feat. 

&gt;It is the smoking gun that will prove that Geneticists have been lying about the effects of the products they create. I dare you to dig your hole deeper by making this more mainstream. Go on.

Yet more unsubstantiated BS. Show me a paper where geneticists have lied about miRNA? 

&gt;I am aware that a quarter of the money has been spent on security, that should say something about gmo's not make a case for public support. You may call me a nutter, but let me tell you something right now, back up your comments with real scientific proof this product is safe or stop trying to make yourself look smarter then me because you simply are not.

Like I have said a squillion times, you cannot prove a negative. The onus is on you to back up your comments that this product is not safe. s yet you haven't not today, not yesterday, last week or any other time you have posted. And I don't need to make myself look smarter than you, you are doing that for me. 

&gt;Here's what you need to provide:
&gt;The studies that conclusively prove that the new gene expression in the wheat is safe for human and animal consumption. This means a study of how the miRNA interacts with humans and animals.

Show me a study that states it wont? Show me a study that focuses of miRNA? Or you could do your homework.... 

&gt;Justify how studying a product not widely used in the UK will benifit tax payers.

You haven't bothered reading the Rothamsted Q&amp;A then? I thought not. 

&gt;Explain how lying about the safety of the product means we should spend more tax payers money protecting it.

Show me where they have lied.

Argh, it pisses me off too much to think about it. I totally *facepalmed* when I saw this thread. I've been living in Greece for almost a decade now and it's.... sigh. There's people starving on the streets, committing suicide because they can't afford to live, giving away their children to the church, with notes explaining that they simply couldn't afford to keep them and they hoped that God could. It's heartbreaking shit. It's not desperately bad everywhere, but that doesn't lessen the fact that this shit is going on within the FUCKING EU and is simply not reported. It's all about the politicians and their little games. 

Oh yes, Greece should default, but that leaves Greece wide open for a bit of old-fashioned interventionism from Uncle Sam (another fact, curiously omitted from many reports, is that there is increasing evidence of a vast mineral/gas wealth in Greek territorial seas - I'll try to find a link if anyone wants one). And in any case, if Greece would default, where does that leave the EU project? 

It's a lot easier to make jokes, really. But who is really lazy and stupid? The jokers, or the victims? Maybe we're all as stupid as each other. I fear a new civil war or worse if things go too much worse. What's going to happen in the media if that can of worms opens? I have the choice to leave - many won't. Or maybe I'll be forced to leave, because the far-right is resurging. Do you blame the voters? Anonymously seduced into privately voting for the party that pledges to get rid of foreign parasites? Golden Dawn (=Greek Nazi Party) got 7% of the vote in the last election. And did you know, that the party which gets the biggest % of any electoral votes gets another 50 seats (out of 300 in total) gratis? 

So yeah, it would have been hilarious to cripple Greece further and host the Eurovision song contest in what could potentially be an anarchist state at war with itself. But you know how that alternative future would pan out - the competition would simply be removed elsewhere. Which is kind of ironic considering what the song contest is 'about'. BTW  - the Albanian song was AWESOME. If a touch screechy towards the end.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Here is why I trust FSG's appointment of Roberto Martinez, if it does end up happening. 

Let me tell you guys a story that has to deal with the Boston Red Sox, FSG's other venture. So, back in 2002, the Red Sox were bought by John Henry and Co. and they were looking to really make Boston a championship contender again. In the states, interviewing a manager is commonplace there is none of this appointing managers and finding a good replacement takes a long time. Well, FSG really didn't do that. They appointed Grady Little who was a proven manager with other teams and showed that he could manage well.

 In 2002, we didn't make the playoffs, even though we won 93 games, which would normally be enough to win the division and make the playoffs. In 2003, we won the Wild Card which allowed us to make the playoffs. We went to the semi-finals before losing in the 7th game because Grady Fucking Little (He is still called this in Boston) would not take out a tired Pedro Martinez who eventually gave up two runs. This, along with a number of other reasons, like not meshing with the players and making poor decision throughout both seasons, led to him being fired.

After his firing, FSG really tried to find the best candidate. They looked at everyone available and even tried to poach other managers from team. They finally settled on Terry Francona, a manager from a small-market team that did average in the league and never really made a dent in the playoff run. Everybody in Boston was confused. Nobody had really heard of Terry Francona until the day FSG announced him as the new manager. 

In his first season, Terry Francona erased a 14 game deficit, (almost like a 42 point deficit in Prem Table), came back from a 0-3 hole to win a seven game series 4-3 (First and only time this has ever happened in MLB history), and won the World Series. Three years later, he won the World Series again. Terry Francona was literally a no-name manager who turned around and erased an 86 year wait for a World Series for the Boston Red Sox and then won again three years later. 

Based off of this, I completely trust FSG's appointment of a manager. They may not know a lot about the sport of football, but they do know what qualities makes a great manager and sometimes the best manager isn't from the best team. 


TL;DR: FSG appointed a no-name manager who won the World Series in his first year after failing with a big time manager. FSG knows their shit. ",0,1338134204,null,0,false,0,c4sxpms,t3_u7amf,t1_c4sxpms,t3_u7amf,null,1429010320,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

On how miRNA is used to block gene expression...

As far as a quick description miRNA binds itself to mRNA from the nucleus in the cytoplasm.  It is then translated into protein and bound by a group of proteins called RNA induced silencing complex and blocks the protein encoded by the mRNA.  It of course is more complex then this but I do know a little about it.  Enough to know the studies produced to get funding is not adequate enough to prove safety.

After doing a bit more reading though i realize there have been further advances in this but they are concentrating on dsRNA which i have to look into further, but i'm sure you are aware of it.

It is then translated into protein and bound by a group of proteins called RNA induced silencing complex and blocks the protein encoded by the mRNA. It of course is more complex then this but I do know a little about it. Enough to know the studies produced to get funding is not adequate enough to prove safety.

Hahaha so you did have a read up of RISC like I suggested then and now you are trying to backtrack and demonstrate some knowledge. 

&gt;As far as a quick description miRNA binds itself to mRNA from the nucleus in the cytoplasm. It is then translated into protein 

miRNA is post transcriptional modifier, it binds to mRNA in the nucleus not the cytoplasm. mRNA is translated into protein not miRNA. 

&gt; and bound by a group of proteins called RNA induced silencing complex and blocks the protein encoded by the mRNA. 

Utterly wrong, you haven't got a clue. If that was the case then gene expression would randomly be blocked by miRNAs all the time. 

&gt;It of course is more complex then this but I do know a little about it.

No you have gone and read a bit and then mashed it all up in your mind so try and show you know something. One of YOUR KEY POINTS was that genes will be blocked my miRNA, yet  you have no idea how it works. RISC is used quite commonly by scientists in the study of gene expression, in plants animals and humans. 

&gt;After doing a bit more reading though i realize there have been further advances in this but they are concentrating on dsRNA which i have to look into further, but i'm sure you are aware of it.

It is not a 'further advance' you are talking crap now to dig yourself out of your uninformed hole. dsRNA is what is used to block gene expression, by using the RISC to process it. It is a conserved process in eukaryotes that related to viruses using dsRNA in a cell.

 It is not miRNA in a cell that then somehow gets eaten, avoids digestion and magically gets into a cell. Then that miRNA blocks gene production which is what you were trying to say in your posts. Do you know how much miRNA is in just one of your cells right now? And how quick the turnover is? miRNAs are not a generic velcro tab that sticks onto any old mRNA, they are highly specific and expressed in levels relevant to gene expression IN THAT TYPE OF CELL ONLY. The expression of a aphid alarmone gene in a plant is not going to affect you unless you suddenly develop the same gene with the same codon usage/bias in all the cells of your body. 

As I suspected you haven't got a clue about miRNA, my guess is you have read somewhere that miRNA from plants/animals have been found in human cells, and then read somewhere else that miRNA is used to block gene expression, and deided in your own confused mind that the two are the same, when in fat they are very different processes. 

**I** understand it because I have spent 4 years studying all this, other people understand it on here because they have spend equal or more time studying it. Others who have self confessed GCSE level biology have grasped it without problem You on the other hand like to shout about it to try and appear that you know what you are talking about when in fact you know fuck all. Your main point was that human genes could be affected when you have demonstrated you have NO KNOWLEDGE of it whatsoever.

No that is not the reason for antibiotics or the gene at all. 

&gt;You are talking crap not me

No you are talking crap, I am saving the above just because it is the best example of someone claiming to understand a process that they clearly have no idea about. You are floundering in your own BS. 

&gt;It is well known that these things are used in gmo's and a whole lot more ways as well. 

Oh I know, I know *exactly* how these techniques work, I use them every day in the lab. As do thousands of others. You claim you understand them, yet you have no clue. 

&gt;I'm not saying the e-coli is a problem in itself since we have it in our gut, but i'm not convinced it is safe and there aren't enough studies to prove it.

Oh that is ok then, because the ecoli that invaded the plant cells with the antibiotic DNA and gold dust hangs about on the plant as it grows right? 

Yet again you make is easy for me to show you have no idea how they created the wheat, what techniques were used or what any of it means. 

Reading back over your posts, I am truly stunned anyone can be that stupid. It is one thing not knowing how these techniques work, it is another thing to pretend you do know how they work, makeup bullshit reasons why they are harmful and then blatantly reveal you do not know anything.

I ask again, are you a member of taketheflourback? I am pretty sure you are.

Our motto is actually 'Ad Vitam' (for/to life), so they value teaching us life lessons like that. My maths, drama, history and economics teachers have all discussed debt and its consequences quite thoroughly in class - maths as a result of learning about inflation and interest (people asked why interest rates were different for different things), drama because the teacher was struggling financially and we took it as an opportunity to ask her to explain debt properly, history because a few people didn't understand the difference between debit and credit cards, and economics because it was part of the course.

As I said though, my school is 'progressive', so I don't really know how much is mentioned in other schools, if at all. I do think it's weird that they don't seem to teach anything about it, but I also think it's one of those things that should be a parental responsibility as well - like how you get told about STDs and pregnancy in sex ed, but it's up to your parents to try to express how you should decide to have sex and when is the right moment and all that stuff. Teachers rarely manage to seem as personal as parents (or older relatives like brothers and sisters), so even when they're talking about something in a personal way, as a student, I kind of take it as ""oh, they're meant to say that, it doesn't really mean anything"", unless it's in a discussion about their personal lives like my drama teacher talking about her debts.

I think that they should have some sort of miniclass in sixth form on things like mortgages or whatever, just so that people know something about it. My mum was always super open with me about our finances and I actually did most of our accounts when she opened a business when I was 10, because she wasn't very computer-savvy and I was a boss at excel.

The fact that horizontal transfer of any material from plants to animals miRNA or anything else and can be found in the blood means that scientists have been lying from the beginning.  They are not encapsulated by magical soap bubbles protecting us from what ever they may do to us.  

You scientists always want to perpetrate the next lie and of course you do, because you would be out of a job if the usefulness of your area of specialty was of no value.  This is why the lot of you are attacking me, not because i'm less knowledgeable.  You know that public opinion will be the judge and jury of you line of work.  This campaign to Harold in the age of gmo's in the UK will not gain you or gmo's any popularity.  In fact you are burning your own bridge by engaging the way you are.

People aren't stupid.  Nutritional food promotes health, increasing the yields of commercial crops is a false economy even if you could prove them safe, which you can't.  You have no idea what they will do to the micro organisms in the soil or how far that will leach into the environment and affect surrounding areas.  Humans need 90 nutrients and minerals for good health and the soil that commercial crops are grown in have very few of them already.  In fact just to get plants to grow to maturity chemical fertilizers have to be used.  Creating more food that is less dense in essential nutrients to save us from starvation and disease is the greatest lie perpetrated on us.  

You want me to trust you?  start researching how we can consistently and sustainably grow nutritious crops.  Don't feed us with the bullshit that you are working to save humanity from starving, because we are starving already, eating the food that is grown.  People don't crave veg because it doesn't have anything in it we need.  We crave junk food because it tricks us into thinking we got what we need.

Do they need a warrant or consent if there is a crime happening in your premises?  I don't think so, and it could be argued that your serious threat to the police can lead to other things from your window/house and so obtaining evidence and finding your intentions may be utmost importance in the eyes of the law.

From the statement it sounds they waited outside patently and then tried the handle to find out if someone was in.

Lets look at it another way they were quite loud in knocking and tried the handle as a result, I would be SERIOUSLY worried if I spent ages knocking at the door of my neighbours and no one answered and then found out the door was open.

The police retreated from the premises after establishing everything was ok and asked questions from outside the entrance.  They can't use anything they saw as evidence inside the premises and they don't intend to follow it up, they entered to ensure the safety of the persons inside.

&gt;The fact that horizontal transfer of any material from plants to animals miRNA or anything else and can be found in the blood means that scientists have been lying from the beginning

For completeness do you want to show me the papers you have got this from?

This campaign to Harold in the age of gmo's in the UK will not gain you or gmo's any popularity. In fact you are burning your own bridge by engaging the way you are.

Translates as 'you scientists are big stink poo and mean and nasty to me because you all want to lie'.

Ha! If you knew how the scientific community worked, there would be more to gain from exposing another scientists work as a lie than to cover it up. You are being attacked because you come on here spouting bullshit claiming you know how it works and you have been shown up to be an ignorant fool. 

&gt;People aren't stupid.

No indeed most are quite capable of understanding GM technology. The problem arises when people like you, and Takebacktheflour spin them bullshit information.  

&gt;Nutritional food promotes health, increasing the yields of commercial crops is a false economy even if you could prove them safe, which you can't.

And you cannot prove them unsafe. Science can test for all variable possible to ensure food safety, and in the decades that the world has been eating GM food, none of it has been proved to be unsafe. You cannot prove a 0% risk of anything, it is a negative. Jeese how many more times just it have to be explained to you.... 

&gt;You have no idea what they will do to the micro organisms in the soil or how far that will leach into the environment and affect surrounding areas.

Soil microbiologists that work at Rothamsted are the bods for that. Unless you are now going to try and say you know about soil science? 

&gt; Humans need 90 nutrients and minerals for good health and the soil that commercial crops are grown in have very few of them already. In fact just to get plants to grow to maturity chemical fertilizers have to be used.

One point we do agree on. So how about shouting a the farmers to look after their soil better, remineralize it etc?
 
&gt;Creating more food that is less dense in essential nutrients to save us from starvation and disease is the greatest lie perpetrated on us.

This wheat is being tested to repel aphids, and to decrease the amount of insecticides used. There is some work being done, and has been done of creating crops that need less fertilizer. Are you seriously saying it is better to stick with the current system of heavy use of  chemical  fertilizers and insecticides? 

&gt;You want me to trust you?

Nope. 

&gt;start researching how we can consistently and sustainably grow nutritious crops. Don't feed us with the bullshit that you are working to save humanity from starving, because we are starving already, eating the food that is grown. People don't crave veg because it doesn't have anything in it we need. We crave junk food because it tricks us into thinking we got what we need.

I'd love to but I am not a plant scientist, I am a microbiologist. 

&gt;Do your research, you will find i'm right. many of the illnesses that we have now days are treatable with nutrition not more gmo. Get of your scientific soap box and start doing some research that really matters to humans, not corporations.

How about you do your research instead of coming on here spouting crap that you do not understand. Scientists research their field because that is what they are interested in, no one does it for glamour or money, that I can tell you straight. You have to be driven to find out answers, whether that is important to a corporation or not is irrelevant.

Yes, they do. Bt maize has resulted in yield increases of up to [12% in Spain](http://ipts.jrc.ec.europa.eu/publications/pub.cfm?id=1580), and massive decreases in pesticide use. Transplanting the [C4 photosynthetic pathway](http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081203/full/456563a.html) into C3 plants could result in a 50% increase in rice yield.

I wouldn't have to do anything as I don't work for a corp or Rothamsted. If a corp came a long and used the technology developed by Rothamsted, then they would have to sell it to the farmers.

The English authority declined until the 1400s, when the Normans and Native Irish were almost totally in control. Henry VIII in 1536 decided to reconquer it, which was essentially the beginning of the real Anglo-Irish conflicts. The [Desmond Rebellions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Rebellions) and the [Nine Years' War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Years_War_(Ireland/)) happened as a direct result of Henry VIII's decision, the latter with ~100,000 Irish soldiers dying during it (although a lot of that was famine), according to the wikipedia article.

Only then does Oliver Cromwell come into it, enforcing the protestantism upon the Irish people. He wasn't even the one that had started the anti-Catholic movements against the native Irish people, it was Henry VIII who started that during the Restoration when he separated from the Catholic Church.

There aren't innocent people being forced to move homes because people are still fighting about it and there aren't riots every year about it.

Adrain Gonzalez has been amazing for the Red Sox and Carl Crawford has been injured for the entire season so far. Also, our entire outfield is out injured. That's like having no Kuyt, Gerrard, Lucas, and Downing for 1/4 of the season. 

They didn't make the playoffs last season because the players fucked around and didn't have the motivation to finish the season out. They were ahead by 9 games by the beginning of September and then became comfortable and started losing games they shouldn't. Since 2002, they have made the playoffs 8 times in the most competitive division in the MLB.

Kenny have a season and a half. Kenny was never meant to be a long term manager for the club. He was brought in as a short term replacement and after this season FSG realized they needed a different manager. Kenny was out of the managerial game for a while. The game changed a lot since his last managerial job. 

Whoever they get will have time to prove themselves, no shit. If you have followed the Red Sox at all, you would know that they do not look for instant results.

&gt; One placard asks: ""9,560 Nurses or 1 Queen?"" The answer, for members of Republic, is a no-brainer.

but...

&gt; ""We want to get rid of the monarchy and have a republican constitution with an elected head of state.""

So what happens to those nurses?

&gt; ""It's not chosen by the people, doesn't represent the people, and as an institution it isn't fit for purpose,"" says Mr Smith.

Except the current monarch enjoys an approval rating that politicians could only dream of.  In short, most people in the UK want a Queen.

&gt; Recent polls haven't provided him with good news here. One published by Ipsos Mori in May suggested 13% of Britons wanted a republic.

&gt; But Mr Smith dismisses the accuracy of that. ""It's clearly a blip because every other poll before and after shows about 20-25%.""

So the majority want a monarchy, not a republic.  Sounds pretty democratic to me, let's give the people what they want.

&gt; And Republic's chief executive believes opinion is shifting: ""The other 75% of the population aren't all monarchists"", he says.

&gt; Many are stuck in ""default position"" and ""don't know how to change it"".

Ah the old ""they simply don't understand that they're wrong"" argument.  We obviously need a head of state.  I'd rather we had one who doesn't have to make idle promises that can't be kept.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"Agreed. It will be extremely difficult to turn a profit *and* win and I think that FSG know that. But, ultimately, winning means increased revenue and - as ax4of9 pointed out - increased recognition of an already recognizable brand in football. And in terms of value, according to [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2012/04/18/manchester-united-again-the-worlds-most-valuable-soccer-team/) we have a long way to go before we're near the top of the most valuable franchises in football.

&gt;The five teams that are worth at least $1 billion–Manchester United, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Arsenal, Bayern Munich–advanced to at least the round of 16 in last year’s Champions League. Not only do these teams reap direct revenue from finishing near the top of their domestic leagues and tournament competition, but they also generate rich sponsorship and merchandise deals from the powerful brands they have built through success on the pitch over time.

I'm not saying anything new but we all know how crucial a Champions League spot will be for us.

To over-simplify, it's the old saying of ""You've got to spend money to make money.""

And you've got to spend money to win. And, at the end of the day, FSG wants to win. I have a feeling there were eyebrows raised and a lot of grumbling when FSG/NESV purchased the Boston Red Sox and they introduced this idea of ""Moneyball,"" hiring an impossibly young general manager, etc.

But they won a couple titles and - in spite of recent struggles - they have turned the franchise into a winning and respected organization both now and for the future.

true,mrsbanana,null,null,"&gt;Typical OU tuition fees for 2012/2013 range from £1470–£2045 for 120 credits of study, which is equivalent to a year’s full-time study at a campus-based university.
&gt;What you pay is proportionate to what you study; most OU students will study 60 credits a year, half the rate of a full-time student, and will pay tuition fees in the range of £735–£1080.

&gt;Wales and Northern Ireland: Fee grants, Course grants and the Access to Learning Fund

&gt;Depending on your income and your course of study, you could be eligible to apply for a Fee grant, Course grant or help from the Access to Learning Fund.

&gt;Fee grant and Course grant – if you are on certain benefits or have a household income below £28,065 (plus allowances, where applicable) you can apply for some support towards your module fees and study costs.

&gt;If you live with your parents, their income won’t be included in any assessment of your household income.

&gt;You’ll need to be studying between 30 and 120 credits' worth of modules to qualify (usually with a minimum of 30 credits for any one module).

&gt;Access to Learning Fund – students with a household income below £28,065 (plus allowances, where applicable) can apply for assistance from the Access to Learning Fund. This fund is provided to assist students who are facing higher than expected costs as a result of their study. It can’t be used to pay for tuition fees, but will support course-related costs such as travel, childcare and internet access. Funding may be limited and is allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.

&gt;For more information about financial support, try our on-line eligibility checker or speak to an adviser.

&gt;Scotland: Fee waivers, fee grants, ILAs and discretionary funds

&gt;Part-time fee waiver – if you are studying an OU undergraduate qualification and are on certain benefits or have a household income of under £16,510 (or more if you have dependants) you could qualify for a module fee waiver, which will cover the total cost of your tuition fees for the module so you pay nothing. Certain modules may not qualify.

&gt;Part-time fee grant – if your personal income is £22,000 or less a year, or you’re on certain benefits, you can claim up to £500 a year towards your module fees if you are studying at least 40 credits a year. You will need to apply in time to complete your application by the final enrolment date of your module.

&gt;ILA Scotland learner account – ILA Scotland is a Scottish Government scheme for anyone aged 16 or over living in Scotland studying at undergraduate level. If your personal income is £22,000 or less a year, or you’re on certain benefits, you can claim up to £200 a year towards a wide range of modules, where the amount of study is less than 40 credits. You will need to apply in time to complete your application by the final enrolment date of your module.

&gt;Discretionary funds – students in financial hardship may be eligible to apply for help with study costs.

The call for an inquiry is not to say that there is automatically an accusation of wrongdoing or indeed any criminal action, It is simply to say let the facts speak for themselves. It may very well transpire that there is no case to answer and that the facts of the case are indeed not as bad as the media are reporting.

true,antantoon,cnty-expat,Costa del Crime,"Yes I know western media portrays Russia in a bad light but I wouldnt be surprised if they were selling arms, I mean USA sell arms to just about anyone who wants them even to their future enemies. With the Syrian uprising, the leaders of the uprising are religious nutcases but the leaders of Syria are not much better. This is why there has been little support for the uprising unlike in Libya where religion did not play such a huge role in the revolt. 
 
Our media is only a little less sensationalist that is all, they will rarely support Russian decisions and UK politicians tend to keep quiet about Russia in general. Personally I believe the Muslim Brotherhood will follow regimes along the lines of Saudi Arabia, although not as extreme, and while the Muslim Brotherhood focus on religious matters they will ignore political, social and economic matters and Egypt and Syria will turn out the same if not marginally better than under a dictatorship.

I'm not saying we should continue dictatorships, I am all for allowing the people to vote for who they wish to govern them, however with the Americans increasing support for the Brotherhood this will prevent a more unified Middle East and continue to split nations along religious and national issues. That's why the Americans were so afraid of the Pan-Arab Nationalism in the 50's because a strong and independent Middle East would scare the Americans and their Allies (Israel) and could have turned into another economic powerhouse. As we know the Americans intervened in just about every conflict in the Middle East in the last 60 years, be it directly through military force or indirectly by supporting one ""rebel"" group over another like with the Mujahideen. 

Sorry for the rant just like to get my opinions on the Middle East across.  Overall the Syrian conflict is very complex and not as simple as the good side versus the bad side. Unfortunately the spread of radical Islam since the 1940's has harmed the Middle East in more ways than they can imagine. Muslims before were much more sensible and the imams

Actors also sometimes find it hard to bring back a character after moving on in life. Your experiences colour your portrayals of characters, and some find that going back to an old character just isn't the same; the chemistry is gone, so to speak.

Rory &amp; Amy have a falling out. Look to ""divorce"" each other. But The Doctor tries to rekindle their love which leads to The Academy Of The Question hijacking the TARDIS.

But Amy/Rory know that so they go inside leaving The Doctor trapped outside somehow unable to go stop them from doing so in order to pilot it to another moment in time than the pre-set Academy's chosen destination. And as Amy/Rory realize they still love each other and shouldn't divorce they walk into the TARDIS and pilot it to that moment in time where Van Gogh sees it exploding, leading to him painting the picture. And then we get closure on how the TARDIS began to explode in the first place and leaves us with Amy/Rory on a positively sad note. The Doctor then finds a timey-wimey way of recovering the TARDIS from the heart of the explosion with no Amy/Rory inside anywhere leaving it open ended to them returning somehow in a future episode.

I forget where i saw it, probably on here, but someone posted a video explaining why there is so much animosity towards 11. It all boils down to the last scene of 10's regeneration and his not wanting to go. I wish i had the link, basically 10's NOT wanting to go was embedded onto his fans as well because it made them feel strongly about him not wanting to leave and then being replaced. It was truly a shitty move on the part of the writers because even when faced with ill timed regeneration, all the other Doctors accepted their fate and changed. So here we are presented with Tennant being portrayed in this crybaby, angry cause he is gonna die, sad cause he doesn't want to go attitude and instantly changes to this bubbly eccentric new guy which equals instant hate from die hard Tennant fans who would rather treat Doctor Who like it is the movie Twilight where they are picking sides rather than enjoying the show for what it is.

It might not use that name, but considering the US, UK, Canada, EU, and Australia are all implementing very similar legislation surrounding informational and other intellectual crimes^1 at the same time, often coming from supranational constructs that have closed discussions outside the democratic process, I think its fair to say that there is some sort of conspiracy at play. It seems more likely than not; there are at least conversations that happen behind closed doors between very wealthy individuals that shape global civilisation. Meanwhile we have other supranational organisations like News International with strong commercial ties to murderers and thieves (and that might be the case if we only include the police and politicians!), who have used their newspapers to steer the political climate of the country since the 80s. One more example would be the IMF and the other financial apparatus again bigger than nations, pushing austerity on resisting countries and who managed to out Italy's 'untouchable' over a weekend where an endless list of sex crimes and sleaze failed. There's the coordinated war on drugs, even bodies like FIFA and the IOC get to buy the sovereignty of nations when they come to town (VIP lanes, special hospital treatment, unfettered access to the public purse, and having the police and judiciary create special task forces solely to protect commercial interests.) You are probably correct though, it's the wrong concept because it is an old world order desperately trying to preserve the wealth of kings and their financiers, we just don't call them that anymore. The invisible hand of the market must be the greatest in-joke of all time.

As I said, it's a side-scrolling platformer in a 3D world: sometimes you turns corners and the world turns around to the right angle. In single-player mode (haven't tried two-player yet), you play as the Doctor and River alternatively. There's lots of very funny dialogue which doesn't hold up the game, because it's usually delivered while you're running.

The ""enemy battles"" are usually puzzles you need to solve before the enemy gets to you/too far ahead of you are they are *scary* (""I need to finish this puzzle before the cybermen get to me and DELETE me!"", meanwhile you hear a cyberman voice in the distance, and the footsteps).

I've been playing on medium difficulty, and the puzzles are good: not too easy, not too hard. Unlocking doors using the sonic screwdriver is done by matching up a waveform with one or two of the analog sticks (amplitude = up/down, frequency = left/right, x/y offset = other stick).

Other puzzles I've seen so far are boards of rotating wheels with which you need to make a ""path"" from one side to the other, a ""rotate rings until image looks correct"" (but moving one ring will usually also rotate another), some ""green lights""/pressure puzzle, etc.

The platform element is very cool as well, with jumping, some ""physics"" puzzles (also using the sonic screwdriver), boxes you need to move, guards you need to kiss (as River), etc.

And then there's a bunch of collectibles: hats for the doctor (they've recorded a reaction to every hat) and diary pages (with stuff about Silence in the Library, etc.) for River.

Could easily have been ""The interior of Sabinos was dark, not for the lack of light, but from the furniture."" 

It is also bad practice to put numbers instead of writing the number, for example don't put ""60"" when you should be writing ""sixty"", or ""5minute"" when it should be ""five minute"". 

Rearraning sentances can also help with the overall readability of the sentance, and make it sound more..natural?

I know I'm going to get downvoted for this but people are miserable bloody sods about the Olympics. There are obviously some questionable things surrounding it as DRMacIver has pointed out. But...

The Olympics are going to be great fun for all the people involved and, trust me, there are a LOT of people involved. Ranging from students to professionals across many industries. Literally anybody can get involved in some way or another, a few friends have obtained internships as a direct result of the Olympics.

As for economic side of things, yes, it is expensive. But it is undoubtedly going to give us a massive boost in tourism, its going to raise awareness for British tourism and culture across the world and, assuming it all goes okay, is going to make more people want to come here.

Post-Olympics we're going to have some world class facilities which, hopefully, will contribute to their communities and get people involved in things, be it sport or maybe by providing a few jobs - either way it's a benefit.

I don't buy into this sodding crap that it will only help London either.  Well guess what, London for the rest of the year, every year, helps the UK so redeveloping the whole East End was probably an astute decision, and if these hobbit Olympic naysayers ever venture beyond their Shires they'll come to see that.  Besides, do people really think the world's richest tourists are going to appear in London for 2 weeks and then not take a chance to visit the Norfolk Broads, the Lake District, the Cotswolds, Edinburgh and the rest?  Really?  They think they're just going to come, stay near the Olympic village having come all that way and then leave?  Of course not.  Damn, we probably even have grounds to demand an additional Paris tourist tax.

And Glasgow, you can shut up too.  You've got the Commonwealth Games in 2014, you can't tell me that British Olympic Success isn't going to be a platform for even more growth and to drive expectations and excitement up for Glasgow.  2015 the Rugby World Cup comes to Britain - we can still be surfing the Olympic feel good wave.

&gt;
&gt;“….there was also a potential issue around equity between work experience placements and permanent staff.  For example, many retail jobs required staff to work for 16 hours each week, with overtime payable for any hours worked beyond that.  Work Experience allowed for 25 hours work activity, so **overtime to permanent staff was being reduced or removed.  [p.9-10] There was also evidence to suggest that work experience placements were being taken on to cover Christmas vacancies.**”

&gt;
&gt;“… the situation that I am observing in retail where people are being placed for free in retail operations for work experience….
&gt;
&gt;…squeezing out permanent employment in relatively low-paid retail. I have noticed companies such as Tesco making their standard contracts four-hour contracts. WH Smith has a zero-hour contract policy, as do places such as Primark in my constituency. I have constituents who have worked in those places and who are not getting the hours of work that they used to have, which is obviously having very substantial follow-on impacts on tax credits and so on….
&gt;
&gt;…In my constituency, one of the things that is happening is that many people are being given work experience-unpaid-in retail,…when they [retailers] are offering jobs, a company such as A4e, which operates in Slough, can say to Primark, “If you want more of our free workers, I hope you are going to give our people 20-hour jobs…
&gt;
&gt;…I want to know how – it is not even in the Report – we protect against the risk of job substitution as a result of this programme, because it is not factored into how people are paid.”

Most recent for me, as I still have the details handy was a basic office role - sitting at a desk for 30hrs a week answering phones and working within MS Office. Maybe I'm being an ass about all this, but I don't want to enter an unpaid work scheme to sit at a desk and gain nothing apart from the willing to live (I've had previous office jobs like this in the past which is half of why I was chosen to do this placement).

I didn't go to College and University for 6 years in total with thousands in debt to be thrown into the workplace at the lowest of the low (No disrespect to those who are in these job positions!)

About being *offered*, I only entered the 'system' only fairly recently (little more than 2 months). The biggest issue to the 'system' is the long term unemployed. A large chunk have been unemployed for 1+year and show little sign of moving. 

Locally, I keep getting told that x% of those who take placements find full time work within 13weeks.

In a way I do understand their approach, and for those who can work, but have done NOTHING for years then yes, make them at least try a work placement and encourage them to get back into work. Problem starts when you push people too hard - I feel like I'm being pushed too much and rather than being helped, which is THE reason why I entered myself into the 'system'. I'm being bullied so they can tick off some boxes.

Last note regarding pay, while at this point the lack of pay for me is discouraging, It's not a deal breaker yet.

 - It is an excuse to lock London down yet even further (e.g. special VIP lanes, banning branded clothing in certain areas, photography restrictions, listing to mobile calls within London, pre-arrests, etc).     
 - They have literally imposed new laws to protect the official sponsor's exclusive rights to make money. For example it is illegal for a business to use the words ""summer"" and ""2012"" together in a marketing advert. If they do so they can get an unlimited fine.    
 - The way tickets were sold (""rich people only"") where the more money you had to gamble with the more potential ""bids"" in the lottery you got (also Visa only!). This meant that poor people likely could only make a single ""bid"" assuming they even have a Visa card to do so - as cash payments aren't accepted.     
 - Just the ugly commercialisation of it. None of the advertisers really care about what the Olympics is meant to stand for, and instead just splash the logo all over their products.    
 - The fact it is taking place in London as opposed to literally any other part of the UK which might actually benefit from the redevelopment. London is by far the least needy place in the UK but yet gets the most attention and most investment.

Some study hard to the exclusion of all else, use their time to grow intellectually, join societies / sports teams etc. and make a success of their time at University. Some squander their time on drinking, partying and staying as far from a lecture theatre as possible, even failing their degree. Some find a healthy mix of the above two scenarios and do simply ""ok"". 

And I think this is what we can expect from this start-up loans scheme as well. A mix of good, bad and ugly. There may be some really bright sparks out there who just lack the financing to get started - but there are surely also those who see it as a neat way to avoid finding alternative full time employment or to waste the money elsewhere. 

Time will tell which way this goes... 

As a political aside... this does feel very much like a PR move from Cameron. It's a little difficult to see the wisdom in financing this whilst making significant cuts to other sectors.

I guess I was under the impression that only those that had been on JSA for some time were being made to go onto this scheme which I see now is wrong. Those that haven't been able to find a job in over a year of looking either aren't really looking or need to get training/school to give them current marketable skills. Or maybe even look into relocating? I know that's not always possible for some, but maybe some government help relocating to an area that has need of that particular type of skill set?

On those getting placement, without more stats, it doesn't mean a whole lot I think. Like, are those who are getting jobs getting them at pay scales comparable to what they were getting previously? Or at least commensurate with their experience and education? Or are they having to settle for the first thing that comes their way?

Do you understand that? Why are you taking yet another opportunity to beat a post down and force the conversation into protecting the reputation of her majesty's finest?

It shouldn't excuse oneself from the ethical implications of one's actions. I bet IBM had a similar rational whilst they created the software to keep tabs on the jews, the financiers giving out poor credit, or even the companies today selling tear gas to Bahrain.

The training: like many others you are displaying the 'hate for the other' that is so symptomatic of Britishness.

miRNA is linked to controlling gene expression and these scientists have proved it!  

&gt;The team concludes that miRNAs may be a new class of functional components in food, like vitamins or minerals—even in an animal that’s pretty far removed from their home organism, they can manipulate gene expression and have an effect on nutrition.

&gt; They will not really be supported or mentored in an appropriate way.

When I started looking at self-employment I got *excellent* support via the local chamber of commerce and small business advisory bureau. I believe that these were two separate organisations but at the time they shared offices in my town.

I was given several free classes - I believe it was one short day a week for several weeks - in basic ""how to start a business"" stuff. Legal requirements, company formation, assessing target market, marketing, writing a business plan, costs, profit and pricing - all this kind of stuff was covered.

I was directed to this course under the New Deal, and as such it counted as ""employment training"" for jobseekers / benefits purposes, although the small business advisory bureau held the first few weeks of the course open to anyone who wanted to attend. They also offered free business counselling with one of their mentors for anyone who wanted it - just phone them and book an appointment.

So the support and mentoring certainly was there when I needed it in 2004, and it was free to anyone. However, I would guess that the small business advisory bureau was publicly funded, and I wouldn't be surprised if they suffered cuts during the recent austerity. With local citizens advice bureaus and rape- and poverty-crisis centres going under, I assumed they would have closed. Likewise, [the Tories were talking about getting rid of the New Deal](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8289169.stm), so I have no idea if the financial support I got (of which I'll talk more in a moment) is still available. 

&gt; £2500 is the sort of amount I would expect someone that age to be able to raise interest free from friends and relatives

Depends who you are. My father had absolutely *no faith* at all in my business, for various reasons I won't bore you with. He was actually with me when my first call came in and expressed shock; he was humble and complementary when the business showed success within 6 months. 

Now my parents *could* have funded me to the tune of £2,500, but my father wouldn't have done. And I'm fortunate, middle-class and privileged. If you grew up on a council estate, maybe you're lucky to have two parents working minimum wage - there's *no chance* they're going to be able to offer that support.

However, I am dubious of the value of a £2,500 loan. If you're an entrepreneur and you need capital, then you'll find it - you'll earn it yourself. There are plenty of businesses you can start that have no barriers to entry, which you could start with less than £100 of investment. So if you need £2,500 in order to build high-end custom gaming computers, you'll start out buying crappy PCs for £1 or £2 a time from the local tip, stripping them for parts and getting them running.

What the New Deal did for me was it paid my rent and benefits (plus an additionally £10 a week ""training allowance"") for the first 6 months that I ran my business. This is exactly and perfectly what an entrepreneur needs, IMO. During that time, any cheques I wrote (and I'm not sure if I was able to have a debit card on my business bank account) had to be counter-signed by my mentor, and I was not allowed at my earnings except for business purposes. 

So that scheme was a *huge* difference from the current offer. If one borrows £2500 to pay for food and rent then that'll last maybe 3 or 4 months these days, for a single person (rather than the 6 months I had), and the liability to repay the money remains with the jobseeker-entrepreneur. And, y'know, a huge percentage of businesses fail, especially first ones; I think the benefit of the scheme I was on was that it was ""training"" - if the business failed then, yes, the government had funded that attempt, paid for the entrepreneur's food and rent for 6 months, but hopefully the entrepreneur benefitted from a learning experience. Hopefully even some of the failed businesses would lead to entrepreneurs who were successful on their second attempt. And that second attempt, surely, wouldn't have been funded by the New Deal - I'm sure there were protections in place so that you couldn't start a fake business every 6 months, just to scam the dole office for food and rent. I mean, you could take a 6 month course in bricklaying to get on benefits' training allowance, or probably take some further education at the local college - we accept that not all of those candidates will carry on to be bricklayers or utilise their further education, we just fund training to try and help people back to work.  

If your business plan says you're going to earn £200 profit in the first month, and £2000 in the 12th month, then that's a really tricky way out of unemployment and the scheme I was on was ideal for it. If you spend months labouring away writing software you want to sell on subscription, then you now have to give up your benefits (food and rent) the first £30/month subscription you sell. You might be totally confident of having 100 monthly subscriptions by the end of the first year, but if you're getting kicked out of your flat at the end of the first month then that's no good to you. Likewise, if you want to experiment with buying stuff from the local tip or at car boot sales, doing it up and selling on eBay - making a business of that is illegal if you're on benefits, but it's just the sort of thing you may need to work up in size as you learn what kind of product is popular enough to sell, learn what kind of margins you make and how this affects the time you can justify on repairing items. 

&gt; We are in a recession (so they are unlikely to succeed)

Bit dubious of that. If you're insightfully business-minded and you're a hard worker, then you can succeed in any environment - it's just a matter of choosing a niche for which conditions are suitable. Where there's muck there's brass, and there are probably loads of examples of great historical entrepreneurs (Henry Ford?) who rose to success from depression. 

The best thing about starting a business in a recession is that if you can manage to make a living out of it then you have a massive head-start when the recession ends. 

If there's no recession on then people don't need a £2,500 loan - they just take a job for 6 months and save their pennies, before quitting work to start up on their own.

If ""more businesses succeed"" in times of economic growth, remember many of them are middle-men who aren't really adding value. Depression entrepreneurs succeed because they add true value (but that doesn't mean they don't need a little help, sometimes).

I'm not a fan of Labour or the Tories, or of Tony specifically, but this was something that was *really* positive for me, that was introduced by Tony / Labour.

When I started my business in 2004, I was given 13 weeks (I think) of once-per-week business 101 classes as I wrote my business plan. I was then able to continue claiming benefits for 6 months as I started the business, on the condition that my business bank account was set-up so that my mentor (a guy from the local chamber of commerce / small business advisory council) had to co-sign any cheques I wrote. I was allowed to do work, buy materials and office supplies, spend money on marketing and earn money - I received the security of benefits (food and rent paid) as long as I didn't enjoy the profits during that 6 months, whilst we established whether the business was viable. AFAICT the Tories scrapped this whole arrangement.

So minimum wage these days is £6.08 - based on 40 hours a week and 4 weeks a month, that's £970. Assuming you can live on a bit less than that - let's say £800 a month (and I think that's less than benefits, for most people), then if you take out one of these loans it'll only last you 3 months for food and rent, instead of the 6 months I was given.

Not only that, but if your business fails, then you're liable for repaying the money you spend on food and rent whilst you were making the attempt - not quite as supportive of jobseekers as I'd wish.

There's a bit about the Enterprise Allowance Scheme in [this thread here](http://www.consumeractiongroup.co.uk/forum/showthread.php?300190-Enterprise-Allowance-Scheme), which gives you a bit of a flavour for it.

true,OptioMkIX,null,null,"&gt;is absolutly no reason to be against this. that is part of the problem, that people see it as a right that they should be given free money for nothing. It is meant to be a last resort to stop you starving, without a roof over your head, not to let you sit on your ass. That is like saying I will stab myself in the leg as I earnt my NHS time. 

I am amazed. I will break it down for you.

It *is* a right that someone has after paying NI for so many years that they receive contribution based JSA. It is *not* free money by any fucking stretch of the imagination since it is funded by the very taxpayers that it helps.

To use your profoundly stupid, reactionary analogy, Im going to assume you have a car and a home.

Do you have home insurance? Why dont you burn your house down, youre covered!

Do you have car insurance? Why dont you try driving like its dodgems at the fair, youre covered!

You are deliberately misconstruing the point of NI.

In the above examples of home and car insurance, you pay a little each month into a fund that is held by a third party that in the event of dire circumstances and that fund is paid out to you after that third party validates those circumstances. By spreading the cost over many months you in effect pay for those repairs to your car or whatever in the future.

Functionally, it is no different to NI, in which you pay a little each month while working which then covers you in the time periods you are not. It is also like having a savings account that you have paid into for a rainy day except that you are not in control of the savings account.

**It is a right of someone who has paid NI to receive JSA because they have already worked and paid for it.**

To further your analogy, your position is very much like saying to a guy whos just retired ""Fuck you, you cant have any of your pension! Despite paying into it all your life, youre not working now so you deserve precisely jack!""

&gt; Doing anything to try to get back into the job market is a good thing, and providing benefit to society in while at it is also good.

This conflicts with your agreement with my third point. They arent benefiting society by working for free for a monolithic corporation, enhancing their profit margin and taking the place of paid employees.

&gt;MiRNAs have been studied extensively since their discovery ten years ago, and have been implicated as players in several human diseases including cancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes. They usually function by turning down or shutting down certain genes. The Chinese research provides the first in vivo example of ingested plant miRNA surviving digestion and influencing human cell function in this way.

&gt;Monsanto's website states, ""There is no need for, or value in testing the safety of GM foods in humans."" This viewpoint, while good for business, is built on an understanding of genetics circa 1960. It follows what's called the ""Central Dogma"" of genetics, which postulates a one-way chain of command between DNA and the cells DNA governs.

Which is a simplified example that isn't the full truth because:

&gt;Researchers have been using this phenomena to their advantage in the form of small, engineered RNA strands that are virtually identical to miRNA.

I'd imagine because due to the huge scope of the development required it would have taken a pretty bold investor to be first to go in alone.  As soon as the state steps in and says this is happening and we're going to make it happen, investors rush in like Egyptian gods in chariots.

&gt;Does that 13 billion include the security costs?

I know it has been factored into it and that it is ultimately coming out of the public purse but then I have no issue with that either.  You don't build a multimillion pound roller-coaster and then forget to put safety harnesses into it.  It's a fraction of the total spend but something if you don't do everything is potentially for nothing.  I certainly don't think major cities should stop holding global scale events because they're afraid of terrorism, and if that means an increased security spend then so be it.

&gt;Also the lottery money is hardly private money. Its as good as tax money surely?

 It could have been, it really should have been, or at least gone to Virgin who promised to deliver all profits to charity instead of Camelot.  Camelot are committed to awarding a percentage to community projects and charities.  In reality it is neither Camelot or the Government that distributes lottery money rather it is shared out amongst 13 independent distributors and that's where this money has come from.

People would expect me to answer all there questions and if i couldn't they would expect me to run around the store to find someone who could.

The point being, we own massive parts of our banks. Banks that were saved on the basis that they start lending again to small business again, only they didn't.   Focus on fixing that problem.

 He was relocated alright, to a warehouse 1/4 the size, miles away from his clients, not long enough for his light trusses, not big enough for half his kit and a floor unsuitable for fork lift trucks. So basically a useless premises and his business has took a massive hit. Oh and the chance of him bidding for Olympic events never happened, nor ( as he says ) was it ever going to.

It's pretty damn obvious, you get paid for being sick, when you aren't. My company for example does not set out a maximum amount of sick pay, simply that I must get a doctors note if I'm sick for 5 days consecutively. Gains don't have to be in monetary form, any gain, if obtained by deception, is fraud. If you can't see that you are extremely mis-informed.

Here's a few cases where people were convicted for fraud for illegitimately claiming sick pay:

As for Courtois: my guess is that he will get another two years out on loan with quality sides (like Atletico Madrid), and then the upper management will make a decision about who is better and will be better in the near future, Cech or Courtois.

true,[deleted],null,null,"To stop this happening in future I would suggest basic lead training. It shouldn't require strength to restrain a dog, just commands and they're not too difficult to impliment even on an untrained dog. I'm not saying your dog is untrained, but pulling on the lead and straining against you shouldn't be allowed and is a sign of disobedience, and you aren't in control when he's doing it. Next time he pulls you towards another dog, give him a short sharp tug, say ""NO"" very firmly and stop. If you keep doing this he will eventually learn that he's not going to get anywhere by pulling and will stop pulling. It may take days, weeks or months but it is totally worth it in the end. 

I had to retrain my nans 5 year old German Shepherd which would do the same pulling that you described when he saw another dog, but he would leap in the air and stand on his hind legs and pull to the point where he would choke himself. It takes a lot of patience but I would really suggest doing it. My late GSD was very well trained on the lead and would respond to even the lightest touch. It made walks very easy and enjoyable and I didn't have to worry about encountering other dogs. 

I think they guy who was complaining does have a point though. It can be intimidating for people to have a large dog dragging itself towards you, and he doesn't know that your dog is friendly. 

I'm sorry to say that if your dog is pulling like that then he is by no means under control, physically restraining a dog doesn't count as controlling it and your dog's behavior can be intimidating for other dog owners.

Student loans *are* available to part time students at Open University. They are no longer restricted to traditional brick universities.
""To qualify you’ll need to study at a pace that’s equivalent to at least 25 per cent of a full-time student, for example an OU course worth 30 credits.""
However, if you have already got a degree, you can't apply for a loan.

Having said all that, I don't think the OU should be lumped in with all the other universities. It is supposed to be different, OPEN and there for people as a second chance. I think of it as a public service, like a library.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"Today, when people (especially fans) look at managers, they compare what their achievements are, and say that so-and-so should get this job because they have done this-and-this. Sometimes, even club owners do this. If this was the only benchmark for hiring managers, Mourinho would never have gotten the job at Benfica, Rafa would never have been hired at Valencia, and Guardiola would never have been hired after Rijkaard. Wenger would have stayed in Japan, and Klopp wouldn't have had been given the chance to lead Dortmund to 2 Bundesliga titles. 

When hiring a manager/coach, you need to consider more things than his CV. You need to consider his knowledge, his tactics, his methods, his formula and his vision for the future. You know how there are plenty of top players who struggle when playing in different countries? Managers are the same. You need to look at more than just what they have achieved within their comfort zone. 

Has Favre done well for MGB? Sure he has. I would also presume that FSG did look at him. In fact, I'm pretty sure that FSG looked at almost every manager around. If your question is whether he has been considered, I'm pretty sure he has, because I'm pretty sure almost every top flight manager in Europe has been considered. If we are to speculate on why he isn't a front runner for manager, then no one short of FSG can tell you the exact answer. 

The possible reasons are almost the same for every manager who has been rejected: 

Contract cost/length. 

Over-reliance on a specific playing style/player. 

Tactical adaptability but lack of a tactical shape and philosophy. Poor training methods (Just to expand on this, there are some managers who are over-reliant on their coaches/training staff. These managers still do the macro job, but leave the details to his staff. This sometimes mean that the managers don't have full control/knowledge of the training methods.) 

Tactical acumen but lacking in man-management/communication skills. 

Overbearing/domineering personality that is unlikely to fit into a DoF operating system. 

Overrated. 

Limited potential. 

The above are all reasons why a club would reject a manager. Frankly, there has been no official word from the club about actual targets, though if you look at the recent interviews posted on liverpoolfc.tv, they seem to be heavily tilted towards Martinez. Other than Martinez, who has been pictured in Miami with Joh W Henry, every other ""target"" has been pure speculation by the media. The best example was how Ballague, on hearing in the media that Michael Laudrup had been approached, asked him about it when they met the next day. Laudrup was surprised, because he hadn't been approached, but did give an official quote that said [""I havent been approached by LFC but it is 1 of the top clubs in the world. I would love to manage that huge club one day""](https://twitter.com/GuillemBalague/status/203821776877273088) All this, from a simple question asked by a ""friend"" who had heard it in the media. If the media chose to, they would have taken that quote and struck a headline which said Laudrup was putting his name in the hat for the Liverpool job. 

So, my thoughts? There's no point wondering why someone is **not** the Liverpool manager, or why someone was not officially announced as a considered candidate for the Liverpool job. What we should speculate on, is how a candidate who is ""confirmed"" to be under consideration would do in the job. Everything else is just pointless.

It must be something that (at the risk of being obvious here) the Silence would kill to keep others from knowing. Personally, I want to know.

The disconnect between the upper echelons of the party and the average joe - Cameron, when he was campaigning was dynamic, impressive and lead me to believe he'd get shit done. Unfortunately, he seems to have picked the WORST people for a cabinet (Jeremy Hunt, Andy Coulson etc) and is suffering because of it.

Gordon Brown was a fucking disaster as chancellor and as the PM-we-never-voted-for (it was as if Teflon Tony chucked him the keys while he went on holiday), he had this look of futility and tiredness, with no real plans to deal with any problems, or listen to vast swathes of the people over things like the encroachment of the government on people's lives. 

As for Clegg...seems like a nice enough guy, but he's the sort of person you can imagine coming back from a GAP year in India, having had a 'spiritual experience' - some nice idea's, but a lot would be unworkable in the real world, and again, no plan to really DEAL with anything. Too wishy-washy &amp; limp wristed. 

I don't believe Labour as it currently stands have any clue what they're doing - they all seem to be manning a rudderless boat, led by an ineffectual aardman character with virtually no personality, who just seems to encourage shouting at the current administration about everything they're doing wrong, when they had 13 years in power, buggered it all up hopelessly and STILL have no realistic strategies, other than to shout at the Conservatives. It's like if you ask them 'what would you do?' they'd answer with 'Uhm....we don't know, but that's beside the point, the opposition is wrong!'. 

I'd also like to see a government that doesn't try and paint motorists as either a cash cow (Labour) or a great evil that must be destroyed (Lib-dems &amp; Greens) - lots of us suffer from their ridiculous policies on Fuel Duty, VED and a total lack of acknowledgement of the soaring Insurance costs we're having to endure.

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"Modric will not suite our style if we are going for players like Hulk, Hazard. Then we would need excellent play makers like Mata and Silva while defensively utilizing Romeu, Essien and Mikel in the midfield.

Modric would have been great for Chelsea last season when we were lagging behind on useful midfielders who could keep the ball, provide defensive contribution and play deep while creating opportunities. That is when we needed the versatility of Modric, in fact we exactly needed Modric to improve our league position.

However with this trend of going after players like Lucas, Hulk and Hazard it is clear that we are going for a different approach and that Modric is no longer in Chelsea's needed list which is a good thing after how Levy humiliated us in the last transfer window. Modric is a great player and I admire him but he is not coming to Chelsea anymore but that is a good thing because our approach is even better.

Our playing style will now be much faster and defensively more solid.

I think Toivonen would be a great signing. You dont pull 18 goals from a midfield position in Holland or get to captain PSV if you dont have talent.

And regarding your view of Sweden...

The Swedish league was never any good. IFK Göteborg was decent enough in 80's when they won the UEFA Cup twise but thats about it. It's actually looking quite good when it comes to younger swedish players.

[Rasmus Elm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShM4vwsOknc) is one of the hottest players in the Erividise and I can bet my ass on that he is going to a really good club this summer.

[John Guidetti](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM8fjtxMvs) is probably one of the most sought after prospects in Europe after his season in Feyenoord.

[Toivonen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6l5E9PuAps) have been really good in the Erividise for two-three years and got the captains armband this season.

Martin Olsson have been one of the few good parts of Blackburn this year.

Pontus Wernbloom is a classic destroyer and plays in CSKA Moscow.

These players are 25 or younger IIRC.

And we also have some established players like Kim Källström (Lyon), Sebastian Larsson (Sunderland), Jonas Olsson (West Brom), Johan Elmander (Galatasaray), Andreas Granqvist (Genoa) and Ibrahimovic (AC Milan).

The service you've been using can only call at Wrexham because it's using a diesel multiple unit with a cab at both ends.

A unit that the assembly government were paying Arriva to take off scheduled services and run on maybe two premier trains a day, it sits in sidings in Cardiff for hours doing nothing between the two runs.

The loco-hauled train will need a driving trailer on the other end to save them having to faff about running the loco round at Chester and Wrexham. This is what Plaid wanted, a train with proper carriages and a locomotive, not a normal DMU.

Irrespective of what train they use on the service IMO there was no excuse for it not to call at Wrexham. It's not the ""All-Wales Express"" if they missed the largest town in North East Wales off the route for a few years. The single track between Wrexham and Chester does not help with this at all.

For example, below is a quick translation of an excerpt from a current [article](http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/planera-resan-och-spara-pengar) which calls out the UK as the 8th most expensive place in the world to visit.

Most expensive in the world (index value January 2012, index 100 = Sweden)

1. Switzerland 127
2. Norway 125
3. Denmark 111
4. Luxembourg 111
5. Barbados 111
6. Netherlands 104
7. Sweden 100
8. United Kingdom 99
9. France 98

London is likely to be more expensive than the average UK index value, especially with the Olympics going on. Unless the break is very short (or you stay in a 1-star hostel) then the hotel cost quickly exceeds the flight cost.

true,Engineer_Ninja,tennant,Tennant,"Sorry, I think the answer might just be ""they can't because they're Time-Locked."" The Time-Lock somehow prevents The Doctor (or anyone else) from going back and changing anything before or during the Time War (""before"" being a relative term here due to time travel). [spoiler](/s ""Unless of course the lock is broken, i.e. like in ""The End of Time"" by use of a magic diamond."")

I haven't really watched that much Classic Series, but I remember reading that on Gallifrey there is the ""Eye of Harmony"" that links with all the TARDIS's and keeps all the Time Lords in the same time relative to each other to prevent them from interfering with each other's past timelines, or something like that. Except when it was absolutely necessary to the plot (i.e. ""The Three/Five/Two Doctors""). So The Doctor couldn't go back to an earlier point in another Time Lord's timeline even if the Time-Lock wasn't there. But I may be completely wrong here.

Ultimately I'm just speaking out of my ass here, they haven't really fully explained how the Time-Lock works. Yet. But if I had to bet money, [spoiler](/s ""I'm really hoping the 50th anniversary special will deal with the Time-Lock somehow being broken. In my mind, I imagine the episode starting with a flashback, showing the Eighth Doctor setting up the Time-Lock before regenerating. The key to the lock will involve his name somehow, which is what makes it such a deadly secret (except that doesn't explain why he kept his name secret before the Time War, so there are a few flaws to this I admit). The rest of the episode will be about the lock being broken, yada yada yada, and somehow it'll be different than The End of Time. I'm not a creative writer. Also, I fully expect the next companion to be a Time Lady, probably either Susan or Romana III (or Jenny, but I think she's less intriguing from a plot standpoint). Moffat said she'd be someone The Doctor least expected and who could keep up with him. I'd say he least expects someone whom he assumes is dead."")

true,[deleted],null,null,"Part of the severe appeal of Doctor Who is the ""in-joke"". It's hard to perfectly describe, but it's awareness the writer's have that the viewers *know* their watching a television show, and doesn't patronize or pat them on the head about it. In fact, Doctor Who uses it to such a strength it's practically the soul of the show. 

Example: Doctor Who has a history of having to work with a low budget. What's cheaper and more modular than rolling a blue box on set and saying ""There, we're done."" Oh, you need the main character to bypass an obstacle, and it's probably technological because you're writing science fiction? Just have him wave a stick at it which makes a funny, electronic sound. Just two core fundamentals to the mythology of Doctor Who resulted from the fact he exists as a television character. Which the writer assumes the viewer knows, because the viewer isn't stupid. The viewer is a kid, or the kid in you. 

I really could go on, but just about every aspect of Who follows this court of concept, and I feel like I'd be pointing out the obvious in a weird way. By using such basic but polished modules, and arranging them in a correct or appropriate manner, you can get huge and galactic stories from very simple ideas. And it *works*, it actually does.

true,dangercart,lfc68,,"I grew up in America in a very Italian town.  I have an Italian last name but I've never spoken Italian and certainly don't look Italian.  Everyone on my youth teams was always Italian, though, and up through high school the captains of my teams were, too.  When we would get together for things like pre-game meals it would usually be at the home of one of the captains.  At that time (mid-to-late 1990's) there was very little football on television in the US so we would watch videos of games at these events.  As you would expect, most of the videos were in Italian (most games on TV had Spanish commentary) but the one team that everyone seemed to have game videos of with English commentary was Liverpool so we primarily watched those games.  I asked why they had Liverpool videos once and it was basically that the old Italian men (the fathers of my teammates) liked Liverpool from our teams in the 70's and the cultural/fashion connections (I don't think I understood that until I started to learn more about the club's history later) and that carried on when they moved to the US.

That's basically how I came to the club.  They were definitely my favorite (it probably didn't hurt that they would just about always win in the old games I was seeing) but I sort of lost the connection for a few years when I went off to university and had no way to watch games.

true,wafflesforlife,lfc68,,"American here.  Watched the 2005 Champions League Final.  After that I started watching matches with a few friends who were already Liverpool fans.  There are very few things in this world that can get me out of bed on a Saturday or Sunday morning if I'm hungover, but finding a way to watch the Liverpool match is one of them.

On a tangent, I have been having a Liverpool supporter existential crisis, and maybe I can get some thoughts from you guys on this:  I am trying to figure out where I fit in.  I'm younger, a Yank and a more recent fan.  So as an avid lurker on RAWK, and in light of recent developments, I have come to the realization that I don't have an idea of what being a Liverpool supporter means.  I'm not a native Liverpudlian, I did not live through the glory days of Shankly and the boot room, Paisley and Dalglish.  Their philosophy of life and football isn't instilled in me, as it is instilled in others.  I didn't live through the Heysel or Hillsborough disasters. I never felt the rage that was felt when The Sun articles and other lies surfaced. I've read about all off these ups and downs, but it still doesn't feel a part of me. I realize I have had my own ups and downs with the club.  I started with Rafa and the CL final victory and loss, the wrecking ball that was Hicks and Gillet, Hodgeson, the arrival of FSG and their reappointing of KK to manager, and then subsequent sacking. When people talk about Kenny, though, what he means to them as a role model, how he was a leader--on the field, touch-line and off the field--through arguably the biggest ups and biggest downs, I feel a disconnect.  I recognize that KK is a legend, I know what he has done for the club and I wish he was still our manager today, but I can tell that I'm missing something, something that cannot be picked up by reading books or articles or watching videos, and it makes me feel like a second-class fan.

TL;DR I feel like a second-rate supporter because I am missing the history that sets Liverpool apart from any other club.

Manchester for example will not licence them as they only licence vehicles currently approved by the Public Carriage Office in London they also have doubts about the ability of pedicabs to meet the requirements to cover the 'compellable area' that hackneys cover in Manchester. If they were licensed in Manchester under hackney carriage the pedicab driver would need to pass the Manchester knowledge test, then hope to get one of the 30 new licenses released each year and then pony up the fee (£700 p/a IIRC). 

It's all up in the air at the moment, schemes in Cambridge, Oxfordshire and York have either not been approved or subsequently abandoned due to lack of use. Apparently pedicab operators quickly went out of business in many places that ran schemes especially with the work being fairly seasonal. Some councils have successful schemes but far from the majority some schemes face opposition from taxi drivers as well as facing trouble with respect to safety and the fact that pedicab use skews the amount of 'taxis' available with wheelchair access.

 In London it's pretty wild west and pedicabs are charging an average of £11 a fare for trips that average just under a mile, if they were restricted to hackney rates they would be charging roughly half that and outside of London the taxi rates tend to be lower than that again  (£3.70 for a mile trip in Manc 20p/180m after that?)

1.  Man City:  Are going to be top 3 and we aren't catching them.
2.  ManU:  Sadly out of reach at the moment.
3.  Arsenal:  If they retain RVP and sign M'Vila they are tough to catch; if they lose RVP (to transfer or injury or anything) they drop significantly.
4.  Spurs:  Losing out on the CL might cost them Modric and Bale.  We have to find a way to finish above them.
5.  Newcastle:  I expect them to come back to the pack a bit.  They'll have Europa League games to deal with and I think they had quite a few players who over-performed.  They will also have some players looking for their next move which can disrupt a team.
6.  Chelsea:  Lost Drogba but just got Hazard and probably aren't done buying yet.  It's tough to compete in the money league right now...
7.  Everton:  Ugh, we'll finish above them next season unless we way underperform again.

If we don't make some big or very astute signings it will be tough for us to peg back four of those teams (and also not have anyone else jump over us).  If we pass Spurs, Newcastle and Everton but still come fifth you would have to say it is both progress and disappointment but it is hard for me to see how we do better than that next year without hitting the transfer AND health jackpots.

true,Dossena,null,null,"Can't pin point an exact moment. Was sometime during the late 90s (about 1997/8 I'd think). Family was never really into football so never had a team passed down to me like many do. Likewise where I lived there wasn't really any local teams to be influenced by. Most of the kids in my class at school were either Man United or Arsenal fans. Which never really appealed to me. 

I remember seeing a film/show on TV about the Hillsborough disaster (it starred Christopher Eccleston) which brought the club to my attention. The TV soap Brookside (which my mum watched a lot) brought the city of Liverpool to my attention. I liked the look of the place (from what was shown on the intro) and really liked the scouse accent. Then players like Robbie Fowler, Michael Owen and Steve McManaman caught my attention (mainly when on international duty). 

So when I got FIFA 99 I instantly took to playing as Liverpool because of all the connections I had made to the club from before. Since then I've always tried to keep an eye on them. But in my teens football became less important in my life (my friends were never really into it so I kind of distanced myself from it all). 

Then in the last few years I got back into it through a friend. Knew him from school but were never proper friends until we left. Which was when I learnt he was a LFC supporter. So started watching games with him and got right back into football again. 

Because of the time I spent away from football I always feel like a fake when I say I'm a Red. But I honestly love the club more than nearly everything else in life, when/if I have children I'll be sure to raise them as Liverpool fans, give them the gift I never had when I was younger.

true,bluefold,null,null,"I think the show had a lot of promise and was a marked improvement over the pilot episode. 

It has been a trend for the BBC to do these small but ambitious series and then completely fail to promote them in any significant way. Look at the Fades, it won the BATA last night for Best Drama (admitedly against a weak series of Misfits and Spooks in it final year) yet shoved on to BBC Three it never broke 800,000 and rapidly declined in viewership. Dirk had a similar problem that it was dumped onto BBC Four and the HD version did not appear for up to a weak later at some really odd time. 

To me it is almost that the BBC has become afraid of scheduling these kind of shows into primetime viewership after them betting on Outcasts and failing. Yet they hold these shows to the standard of a primetime show when it comes to viewing figures. Even massive shows like Doctor Who have, while not on the bubble, certainly been bubble adjacent in recent years. It is hard to argue for these experimental shows when they know they can pull in 10 million steady from a 'Call the Midwife' yet fluctuate wildly between 10 and 6 million with Who as it is consumed in a hundred different places. 

I have said before that the BBC would benefit from restructuring their channel line up to create a 'BBC Originals' where they show BBC three and Four content along with classic properties from their archives. The main problem with three and four at the moment is they are so heavily demographic focused that people have a little switch that says 'oh that is not for me' in their heads before they even switch on. This should already be being filled by BBC Two but evidently it is not.

Also: Bring back Tomorrows World. The odd segment on Bang goes the theory is great but we are living in Tomorrow already I want to to know what is going to happen the next day.

true,Philomathematic,hartnell,Hartnell,"This is possibly my favorite finale of the new series. It gives the Doctor just the right ending to his arc - previously, he had ended the Time War by killing everything indiscriminately, and that act haunted him throughout the first series. But when confronted with a similar situation, he is able to choose to be a coward rather than a killer and find peace in his decision. Sure, it backfired a bit with Rose's return (more on that later), but it was his decision to make and he made it and proved to himself that he no longer had to be defined by his previous double-genocide.

There's a fantastic arc running from The Empty Child up to The Parting of the Ways in which Eccleston really hits his stride as the Doctor. Stephen Moffat's fantastic writing may well be a factor in really jump-starting the interpretation, but we start to see the Doctor as an inherently hopeful character with his line ""Everybody lives!"" And we see him willing to let live, or at least not kill by his own hand, in the series one finale. Beautiful.

I will readily admit, I draw a lot of my own interpretation for the Ninth Doctor's run from [this fantastic article](http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/doctor-who/21030/doctor-who-a-celebration-of-christopher-eccleston), the entire series of which everybody should read. I definitely agree that Eccleston sold the threat of the Daleks like no other Doctor since. Perhaps my favorite Eccleston moment comes right at the end of *Bad Wolf*, when he looks up and declares that he is going to save Rose. He is finally ready to act. And early on in the following episode, when he declares that he's the Doctor, if there's one thing he'll do it's talk - that's how I've always thought of the Doctor, that trickster who will talk and talk and jerryrig a solution before you realize what's gone on. Eccleston isn't the most loquacious Doctor by any means, but here again you see him really owning the role.

Sour notes for me are mostly to do with Rose. I am an avowed anti-Rose fan, and she is never more annoying than here (well, anything to do with Bad Wolf Bay, but that sentiment will get me into an entirely different sort of trouble). Her sentiment that the Doctor shows people a better way is absolutely correct, and one the Master will mockingly address later when he comments that the Doctor is ""the man who makes people better."" But the way that Rose enacts this philosophy bothers the hell out of me.

The most generous thing I can say about Rose is that she probably has an ill-conceived notion of the Doctor, since she met him just coming out of the Time War. He has already committed genocide once, and given Nine's breathtaking hatred of the Daleks, you can see how Rose might think that destroying them so utterly *is* what the Doctor would want. And her abrupt bitchiness towards Mickey and her mother could be seen in context of the Doctor's own irascibility and bluntness, I suppose... but that still doesn't, to my mind, excuse the way she stomps so completely on Mickey's last hope that she might come back to him. Seriously, any episode in which I agree more with Jackie Tyler than any other human is a poor reflection on everyone else.

So yes, this two-part finale contains some of my favorite and least favorite moments in the show. It demonstrates the best of Doctor Who and Chris Eccleston, and it paves the way for a fantastic next series with David Tennant. Nine's regeneration is hopeful and comforting, two things that I feel Doctor Who should necessarily convey. The Doctor is at peace when facing death, and he tries to make it as easy on his companion as possible. I like to think that even if Nine had died alone the way Ten did, he still would have gone out on a positive note. It's impossible to know, of course, but Nine's arc and ending were some of the most graceful plotting in the revived series' history, to my mind.",0,1338254851,null,0,false,0,c4tgq3x,t3_u8pdo,t1_c4tgq3x,t3_u8pdo,null,1429019412,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

From Rory's page: 

&gt;If the player tries to claim to be the hero of the stories they are telling, Rory will claim that is impossible as the character isn't tall or strong enough, and is also missing a bow tie, which he thinks are cool. This is a reference to Doctor Who as portrayed by Matt Smith, who wears a bow tie and thinks many things are cool.


And the infamous bank knock knock jokes:

&gt;At the western Varrock bank there are two doors leading to the area behind the bank booths. Both doors have the ""Knock-at"" option and when chosen a banker asks who you are then you are give the options of ""I'm (Player's name). Please let me in"", ""Boo"", ""Kanga"", ""Thank"", and ""Doctor"" which are knock knock joke replies. The doctor reply is a reference to the British television show ""Doctor Who"".

Based on that, my answer is that we can but probably won't.  I think that is realistic, not pessimistic.  I disagree with your statement on needing squad strength, though.  I think the problem is that we have squad players in the first team.  If Downing, Adam and Henderson (and I think Carroll) are your squad players then that is fine but you need to sign players better than they are to make that happen.

On the winger question:  I don't think we need a left wing.  I think (based on our assumed managerial connections) that we are going to be a 4-5-1/4-3-3 team so we need a left footed mid-field playmaker to go alongside Lucas.  That was supposed to be Adam (and may still be) but I'm not sold and think we need to find a better option.

Firstly, I apologise for the left wing thing. I combined your comment about  a ""left-footed midfielder"" with ""a goal-scoring winger"" into a left winger. Thing though, why would we need a left footed midfielder in this case? When you have two CMs, you don't need one to be left-footed and one to be right-footed. They have plenty of space in the middle of the park with all sorts of avenues to pass to. 

As for the whole squad players/first team players issue, the whole point is consistency. Again, our team did fairly well against the other Top 4 teams last year, even with what you call ""squad players"". It was always against the poorer teams where we stumbled. These stumbles tended to happen when we had to rest our first team players, which shows that what we need to stabilise our performance in the short run is to get better squad players. 

Disregarding whatever formation the new manager brings in, this means that we need to get a 1st team right winger (since we have none), a back-up centre midfielder to Lucas and a back-up leftback to Enrique. We have cover in every other position, we have either no players or no cover in these 3 spots. Once we close up these 3 gaps, it'll depend on the new manager to see where else he wants to strengthen, though I think 3 players over a summer is a good enough deal.

When looking at the MLS, Philly didn't have a team (they do now, which is nice), and the level of play wasn't as great as the EPL.  

I have older cousins living in the UK, and when they visited (which was much more often when I was younger) we'd watch the EPL or Celtic FC (one's a Scottish man), and Liverpool always seemed to be a team that shared the values my dad taught me to look for in teams.  The passion, the drive, the teamwork, everything was great.  (My favorite player has forever been and always will be Steven Gerrard.)  

Anyway, everyone my age picked Man U as their favorite team (they often support AC Milan and Barca as well), while I was drawn to Liverpool.  I had no idea how revered they were, or how successful the club had been, and I wouldn't have cared.  I immersed myself in their history, having made my decision.  I love that stuff.  Done the same thing for the Flyers, Phillies, and so forth.  You have to know the culture surrounding a team and its history to really support it, and everything about the city, its people, and their team clicked.  I didn't even feel like I had picked the team; it felt like there was no other option.

true,dangercart,lfc68,,"I really just disagree with this.  We came in 8th last season.  One winger and a few back-ups (plus Lucas back from injury) isn't going to do it.  I understand the desire to be positive and support our players but there is a reality that we were miles away from the CL places (let alone winning the title) and the teams ahead of us are likely going to be strengthening their squads this summer (with the possible exception of Spurs if they lose Modric/Bale).  We cannot go into next season with basically the same squad and expect substantially different results.

On our form against teams at the top of the table:  we went 4-5-3 (15 points from 36) against the top 6.  That might be good enough if there is a dominant champion and you are trying to get fourth but it isn't exactly great.  Against the bad teams, I remember two games where I saw the team sheet and knew we were screwed but it wasn't like we were resting players on a regular basis.  Suarez, Gerrard and the first choice back four played basically every game they were healthy/not suspended.  In the case of Gerrard and Suarez that wasn't often enough but that's how it goes sometimes.  It wasn't a matter of squad rotation; we just weren't good enough.  Star players win games when the rest of the team is not playing well.  That's why we call them match winners and that's what we need more of if we are going to really improve.  We need to find those players through scouting and development because we can't compete financially right now but, again, if the question is ""can we finish fourth next year?"" then I think that is the quality of player we need to sign.

On the left-footed midfielder point:  If we play 4-3-3 than Suarez will probably be on the left so he can cut inside and so he and Gerrard don't occupy the same space when Stevie comes forward.  That means Downing is on the bench (where I think he belongs) so you don't have any left-footed player to take free kicks because Carroll and Enrique don't normally do that.  It also just balances the team better.  If we go 4-5-1 and Stevie plays alongside Lucas it is less important but I don't think he can be counted on to play that roll every week.",0,1338261807,null,0,false,0,c4ti6mb,t3_u9e7g,t1_c4ti6mb,t1_c4thujn,null,1429020100,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Relevant quotes supporting this opinion are (3:32) ""You saw me, I changed. Right in front of you."" (4:12) ""Rose, it's me. Honestly, it's me. I was dying. To save my own life, I changed my body, every single cell, but I'm still me."" And at (6:16) when she's having trouble accepting him, he becomes quite frustrated and says ""Oh come on! All I did was change!"" Further supporting this theory are quotes from the Fifth Doctor: ""A man is the sum of his memories, a Time Lord, even more so."" With this understanding of the Doctor, I think if Eleven has accepted it, then Ten most certainly has because they're the same man.

A match winner is obviously important, but I feel that such a player only works when the squad is stable and solid. My priority has always been to stabilise the squad and making sure it is solid and balanced before moving towards getting a match winner. It will be great to get a star player, especially a more incisive winger to replace Downing. However, it cannot come at the expense of filling up gaping holes in the squad. Settling the squad can improve the team as a whole and give us much needed consistency, a star player makes an already good team great. That's a big reason why Torres came in and did well, because the rest of the squad was more or less stable. Your point stands, we just look at the problem from different starting points. 

On the left-footed midfielder issue, I think we can just agree to disagree. There isn't any need for a dedicated left-footed set piece taker, righties can take corners and free-kicks on both sides. Defensively, Agger usually takes the free kicks. Offensively, most teams base the free-kick taker on their set piece ability and not so much the position of the ball. I know you think that it's better to have a leftie to take an inswinger off a corner on the right, but its not exactly necessary, and I think its a frivolous requirement.

true,bloodfyr,mcgann,McGann,"There are varying reasons why I don't like his writing:

* I dislike the ideas he continually reinforces. This example was more in the later parts of his run, but I dislike the constant comparisons of ""THE DOCTOR IS A GOD"". The climax of the Titanic episode, as he's being carted upwards by the Host as incredibly overly bombastic orchestra plays is the worst offender in my opinion. I prefer the Doctor being a quiet guy who saves the universe without drawing attention to himself. RTD had the Doctor getting in more and more grandiose moments which I think Moffat specifically refers to at the end of the most recent season, ""I was getting too big. I need to step back into the shadows."" or something along those lines. 

* Another thing that frustrates me is his misuse of emotions and scale in place of good storytelling. For example, the episode with the return of Davros. This is one of the Doctor's biggest and oldest villains. He's back. He's evil. He's little more than Blofeld stroking his cat in the episode as most of the screen real estate is given to the reunion of characters that the episode could have done better without. The more characters that return (was it REALLY necessary to have BOTH Jackie AND Mickey?) the less screen time is devoted to what was supposed to be the real draw of that episode. You're supposed to be swept up into the emotion of them returning and ignore the story. That's cheap storytelling. The majority of the last half of the Davros episode is the Doctor's round-the-universe tour of his companions (something he would do again just before his Regeneration.) accompanied by sad music. That just reads to me as, ""THIS IS SAD DO YOU FEEL SAD LOOK HOW SAD THIS IS LOOK LOOK!"" That ties into my next point:

* He violates his own rules as a writer. Rose was not supposed to come back. Ever. The breach was closed. The universes would never meet ever. THAT is what made Rose's departure so sad. Well...except that one time. Something that the Time Lords had to do (and that the Daleks were only able to do after basically punching a hole in reality) and humans can do it. 

* RTD spent too much time on Earth. I watch Doctor Who to escape and see new planets and go across the universe. That's what I would expect if a mad man with a box appeared in my bedroom and invited me to go with him. I would leave if I were continually taken to a crappy looking council estate in England. I don't care about Jackie or Mickey. They're not companions. Rose is. I don't care about Martha's parents' marital problems. I care about Martha's travels with the Doctor. Luckily the latter was jettisoned pretty quickly.

* RTD relied too heavily on CGI. CGI is good in small doses. A good majority of RTD's monsters (while he didn't necessarily write every episode, he was the showrunner and he is ultimately responsible) were CGI and whole characters made in a computer look terrible compared to a well-made costume. 

* Every episode of Doctor Who basically boils down to scary monster and running. What sets Moffat's run apart (to me) is that he has the same thing, but still has time for genuine character interaction. Seeing the Doctor interact with his Companions is why I love the show, not seeing CGI Alien #1898932 and Hallway #123988. He relied too much on ""comic relief"" aliens/villains (the fat babies, the Slitheen) and not enough on villains that are truly terrifying. (Vashtu Nerada, Weeping Angels). His reliance on certain jokes (Slitheen farting. Really? Potty humor?) drove me crazy.

* (EDIT) Another thing that frustrated me was the clear preference RTD had for Rose in his writing. His interactions with his companions after her are all shaped by her. Rose was honestly...not a spectacular character, so for a Companion to have such an effect on him when he's had DOZENS of them before (some of which are gone in more permanent ways than being in another universe) is weird and creepy and casts an uncomfortable shadow over the rest of the run. Donna was the only companion I truly liked and that was only in an incredibly begrudging manner (""A good looking turd is still a turd."")

The best episodes in RTD's run are Empty Child/Doctor Dances, Girl in the Fireplace, and Blink. hese are all episodes that do not rely on cheesy emotionalism and bad CGI, but have good stories with genuine arcs, real character interaction, and do not get carried away with nonsense. None of these were written by him, and if the rumors are to be believed, none of these episodes were modified in any way by him either.

Moffat's far from perfect, but overall I've enjoyed the past two years much more than the four before it. RTD's run had its ups (much of the first season, Ten himself, The Christmas Invasion) and he successfully managed to repackage the show to great success for a new audience without dragging along fourty years of baggage, but I still have mixed feelings about the quality of his run.",0,1338264102,null,0,1338265053,0,c4tinjs,t3_u9aqb,t1_c4tinjs,t1_c4ti4hz,null,1429020322,40,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,40

true,dangercart,lfc68,,"We definitely view this team very differently.  Based on your comments about our performances against the top four and here talking about consistency and stability I think you believe that our standard was our best performances and that we just need to consistently hit that level.  To me, those were our best performances and that makes them outliers.  The reality is that were were a consistent team; it's just that our standard was average and we were consistently that.  The outliers were a handful of very good and very bad performances, just like every team has.

The team profile that you are describing is that of the year we came in second under Rafa.  We were consistently really good and lost the title because were did not have the squad strength to support our star players and win games when they were either unavailable or not quite up to their level.  That was sort of a ""poor man's Galaticos"" team that had the same problem as those Madrid teams where the stars were just so much better than the squad that it didn't always work.  Our current team has an ok squad but not the top level talent to compete which makes it a very different (and harder to solve) problem.

On the left footed mid:  I don't think it is a terminal flaw or anything but we are going to have to win games on the margins and I think there is value in having a player who can make accurate deliveries from the left wing and in natural left-footed goalscoring positions (corners are such low percentage plays to begin with that I don't think it matters).  In a committed 4-3-3 it makes more of a difference, though, because that player has to be able to play wide with the fullback so it really is only as important as the system.  If Adam or Downing are regularly in the team that is probably enough.  Agger can take some direct free kicks but he gets no curl on dead balls so you need other options.  It's not a big deal... just something I think the team could use.

1. Yes, that's the difference in how we view the team. I'll admit my version is definitely more optimistic than yours, but your point is good. 

2. The team profile was actually the team in '07 that Torres stepped into. By '09 when we finished 2nd, our squad had actually degressed even though we improved. In '07, we had a balanced squad. We had relatively good back-ups in almost every position. By 09, we lost the likes of Crouch and Sissoko, back-up players to our superstars of Torres and Mascherano. We had an incredible 1st team, and no one to back them up. 

&gt;Our current team has an ok squad but not the top level talent to compete which makes it a very different (and harder to solve) problem.

This is correct. My approach is just to round off the squad first so that we can find some sort of consistency before haring off after the superstar.

I've honestly never been too fond of Rose, partly for the romance subplot (because I believe romance is a cancer on film and televised media, not because ""The Doctor shouldn't get any"") and grew to hate her with the Stolen Earth, etc finale. Martha is fine in my book, but again, romance. I love Donna because for once, there was no romance, no tension. Donna is a much more fleshed out character in my view, and has more character development (more than Martha, one could argue for Rose) and is, after a couple episodes, more likable than Rose.

Rose: Ditched her nice, devoted boyfriend for a guy with a box, making a point to insult him on her way out. Continues to treat him poorly while he continues to help her out despite knowing she doesn't give two shits for him. Doesn't change much, receives everything she always wanted.

Donna: Pulled away from her wedding, assaulted and captured by aliens, misses her wedding, family and friends party while she's missing, fiance used her, is evil asshole, killed by alien.

I think where we are is actually in a similar state to the 2002/3 team, except that the competition is better than it was then.  We had a team with an ok squad but only Gerrard and Owen were really star players.  Fortunately there weren't as many good teams then so we were able to sneak into the CL the next season.  Over the next few seasons we signed a ton of players but the ones who made the difference between fifth and second were Alonso, Mascherano and Torres.  In 2007 we were way ahead of where we are now.  I see our current squad being similar to that one in that we have Suarez and an aging Gerrard but other than that little world class (I hate that phrase) talent.

My point on 2009 was that I think that team needed what you are advocating for now.  If we could have just held onto our stars and filled in some gaps it would have been enough.  I think this team needs a more substantial overhaul and that competition for our current players doesn't do the trick.

It irks me somewhat aswell. Gushing over any culture (especially if it's not your own) makes you seem like a bit of a prick. It's one of the bigger reasons weaboos are so hated.
There is nothing wrong in enjoying other cultures, but coming on reddit and proclaiming your love and desire ""to be"" American is disgusting. It's not only offensive to your country, but to the country you are jerking over.

I can guarantee if that thread had the title ""Dear People of Japan, Do you know how much I envy you?"", then it'll be at the pits of hell, with 4 comments reading along of the lines of ""fuck off weaboo"". And it's that double standard that annoys me.

Modric likes to play orchestrator in the middle of the pitch, sometimes drifting further up and towards the left. With Hazard and Mata already in contention for that part of the pitch, having Modric would simply cause confusion in our ranks rather than the opposition's.

Moreover, with the 4-2-3-1 predicted above, what we really need is another Ramires-like midfielder who can make the same kind of lung-busting runs and put in a similar shift - essentially, a midfield engine to connect the defensive midfield with the offensive power up front.

You could see our team gaining confidence as the game progressed.

Penalties came and I just knew no matter what, Cech would keep us in it. When Drogba didn't show up until the deciding shot I was thinking 'no way, this is either rigged or it's gonna be the greatest moment of my life'

Once he scored I teared up and just fucking ran yelling out words I don't even remember yelling out..I ran out the door in my chelsea gear, and just kept running! came back 15minutes later and watched the replay, posted on this site I think (don't remember) and I have been saving pics, videos, and re-watching various clips on a daily basis.

-Paseo's sandwiches are unbelievably delicious

-Get some pho; the U District is a great place for this because within a few blocks, there are about a dozen independent restaurants competing for the affection of a large, hungry body of students. Pho Thy Thy is my favorite.

-Skillet is excellent, but their food cart can be hard to track down sometimes. They have a recently established home base sort of restaurant, but I haven't eaten there yet, so I can't vouch for it. 

-Dick's is a must. You should feel badly if you leave the city without having eaten one of their burgers. Do bring cash, though, because they don't take cards.

-Molly Moon's has fantastic ice cream, if you're into that.

**Things to do**

-If you guys like music, the Experience Music Project is pretty cool. Also, the Seattle Science Center does light shows pretty much every night in the summer (Beatles, Pink Floyd, etc.) and those are more fun than I expected. There's also a SciFi museum downtown that tends to have some cool exhibits. 

-Visiting Pike Place is bound to be a good time. Even the locals do it. If you're there over the summer (which it sounds like you will be), it'll be especially beautiful and full of fresh fruit, flowers, etc., brightening it up. There are lots of cool shops inside the market and nearby and it's right by the first Starbucks (touristy, I know). 

-If you'll be in Seattle over Labor Day weekend, you should definitely go to Bumbershoot for a day (or more). It's full of great music, food, and all sorts of nice things to look at if you aren't interested in pleasing your stomach or your ears. 

-If you guys really want to see the city, head to the Colombia Tower, not the Space Needle. It's not a 360 degree view, but it's also significantly less expensive and you'll see the city from 77 stories high, which is pretty high. She looks beautiful from that angle. Seattle looks beautiful from every angle.

**Bars**

-I have not actually been bar-hopping in Seattle, so I can't really speak to this, but my ex says worlds about The Rat and the Raven and I believe him. 

That's what immediately came to mind, but if I think of more activities that I think you might find interesting, I'll let you know. I hope these are a helpful starting point for you!",0,1338281414,null,0,false,0,c4tl4ot,t3_u9lsq,t1_c4tl4ot,t1_c4tjvnh,null,1429021555,12,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,12

The government keeps talking about wanting to get people back to work blah blah.

But to my point, there clearly isn't enough job for all the people who have been made unemployed, so asking companies to take on free labour is only going to exacerbate this problem even more.

true,OhWhyBother,null,null,"Alright, I have worked a fair bit of my work-life for radio and I can see both sides of the conversation.

Having worked in radio, I believe that James O'Brien was wrong to make hasty, generalized statements without hearing Lamps's side out first. ([He did explain his reason later, in this interview with Sky Sports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpQX_ZWinas). DYOC.) Worse, he then tried to defend his behavior by saying that as a radio journalist he has to take sides to a story because he can't be seen sitting on the fence - I don't agree with this but I understand where he is coming from. As a radio presenter, it is a must to have an opinion on a story and I state this from my own personal experience.

Most of Frank's defense about Rives hinged around this argument-point:

&gt; Now someone has approached my ex-girlfriend, pretending to be friendly, caught her at a moment where she is a little bit drunk and down or whatever and got a load stuff out of her. 

While I agree that Rives has not lived her life in the public eye as much as Frank has, she must have lived it enough to know that she was better off NOT opening her mouth in public. And why would you want to confide to a stranger in a bar anyway, especially when you are still in the public eye? She didn't deny the quotes which makes me think she said them willingly, maybe even as a way to 'get back' at Frank. (If that is true, then I admire Frank's attempts to defend her even more.)

I particularly thought that he made a decent case for himself in [the part of the conversation](http://www.lbc.co.uk/frank-lampard-vs-james-obrien-the-full-transcript-7811) where he says:

&gt; You've given me pause for thought, but you can not expect verbatim first hand quotes from the mother of your children, when a man that enjoys the level of publicity and profile that you enjoy, to go unremarked by the general public.

Of course, the fact that he very stubbornly defended his hasty (and somewhat high-handed) statements earlier doesn't help his case much, at this point. It might have alleviated some of the trouble he caused for himself earlier in the process but not by much.

It was certainly a tough moment for James O'Brien, the way I see it. If he had accepted Lampard's explanation right away, he would probably have (probably) been branded spineless and an a**-licker. Now, because he tried to stick to his belief, he seems to come across as a stubborn git who had unfairly jumped to a conclusion! 

All said and done, as a fellow radio-professional, I most certainly appreciate the cool head and conversational tone he kept throughout the conversation. ",0,1338283945,null,0,false,0,c4tlca1,t3_u9d73,t1_c4tlca1,t3_u9d73,null,1429021655,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

I was in Granada, Spain. I originally went to this pub my friend recommended, turns out he stopped watching football 3 years ago. Well that pub was one shitty place to watch the game but I watched the first half there, and then started running between every single bar I could see to try and spot where the game was being shown, but everywhere I went they were just showing some news bulletin.

When there was roughly 1 min. till the second half started I ran up to the closest place I could see with a tv, which happened to have a doorman who told me (when I asked) that they were showing the game. It was only after I'd sat down that I realized that this was kind of a fancy restaurant, but fuck did I care, they had a 42"" hd flatscreen, the game on, and I got prime seats (or so to speak :P). 

The doorman asked me which team I supported (obviously didn't watch football seeing as how I was wearing a Chelsea shirt) and decided to root for the blues with me. When the game was in extra time I noticed everyone around me had a beer and was watching the game (contrary to when I arrived and everyone was eating a fine meals and not paying the game any mind), it then became clear that most everyone supported Bayern, but that only made it all the sweeter, for when Drogba stepped on the spot, mind you I could hardly watch the tv anymore do to stress, and put it away I couldn't suppress my excitement and started yelling in celebration, realizing my mistake (fancy restaurant and all) I noticed the doorman standing next to me (big, macho bloke), but he wasn't mad at all, rather happy, and started celebrating with me and lifted me up in celebration.

If it wasn't for that guy, my entire experience that night might've been completely different, but I had a hell of a time, and still smile just thinking about it.

You're looking at this in too simplistic a fashion, the libyan anti-gaddafi movement was made up of multitudes of milita and rebel groups, tribal groups, all sorts. The very lack of the extent of the government in Libya right now necessitates the possibility (and in fact I'd say ensures it) that not all actions which are carried out which are carried out by those who were opposed to gaddafi are done in the name of the NTC or the entire opposition movement.

Was there torture by anti-gaddafi forces during the civil war? Sure, no question. Were there mass killings during the civil war? Quite possibly. But that doesn't mean the NTC is bad - there are a multitude of groups flying under one ideal, to get rid of Gaddafi.

What kind of event is it that you are looking to organise? The area around the ICC has loads of restaurants and bars -- you'll be right near Brindley Place and a hop, skip, and jump from New Street. Is it for something casual or for professional space?

I would suggest a few places that are around there and good fun. I've always been fond of **Pitcher and Piano** in Brindley Place. It's a laid-back place, with Kraken rum, and better food selection (compared to Slug&amp;Lettuce and All Bar One) -- especially in terms of nibbles/tapas. You can rent out a space -- it's £50 in advance, which can be applied to the bill or returned in cash -- and we did a Brum meetup there, which was jolly. There is also **Bodega** which is a ten or so minute walk from the ICC. You can rent out the basement area, giving yourself your own private bar, and they can do a buffet just for the team. I'd contact them as I know this can be a bit steep. Regardless, Bodega has some lovely cocktails and space. I am a big fan of **Bank** and cannot recommend it highly enough for dinner and drinks. It's a bit nicer of an establishment -- also pricier -- but well worth it for the mid-range.

Granted, I focus on food and drinks.

For another event, you could contact [The Electric](http://www.theelectric.co.uk/). It's the oldest working cinema in the UK, around the corner from two very popular drinking establishments (Island Bar and The Victoria), and you may be able to arrange for a showing of an IT related film for a night out. The Electric has its own bar, with snacks, which also delivers into the showing if you fire off a text. Could be good fun?

You could also visit Grand Prix Karting. It's a bit far out, but worth it if you're looking for something fun to do. 

In December, as well, you will be in town for the German Christmas Market. I highly, highly recommend it. While it's no Vienna or Budapest, it certainly has its own charm with its own eccentric characters and delicious drinks (mulled wine, hot cider, pimms!) and food (the pretzels, the marshmallows, the sausage)! I would organise a time to do this with everyone. It's just out the other side of the ICC, carrying all the way along New Street to the Bullring.

true,courters,flare-brum,Occupy: Shoreditch,"Well, this is a late approval. Just saw this in the spam filter. I nearly opened a Mexican restaurant in Birmingham about the same time you posted this. Not sure if this is something you are still interested in doing, but I will tell you that you will need £200,000 in starting capital to receive the visa to begin this endeavor. 

Also, there is a reason Mexican is difficult to find in Europe. The ingredients needed -- for proper, real Mexican -- are difficult to import without spoilage. As another Mexican, I am sure you can commiserate with me on how only the freshest ingredients can be used for guacamole and salsa -- and that doesn't even get into the actual dishes. It's far more expensive to run to the standards we North Americans are used to. Because of this the target market, students, will find it a bit pricier than what they'd pay, especially considering Mexican is known as cheap and cheerful, and delicious, from the US. 

The spices used in Mexican food are not really common in the UK. Don't get me wrong, the Brits love their curries, but jalapenos and chilies -- sure some can handle it, but the vast majority I have met (I did a few dinners where I made Mexican -- here is an idea of cost, to do fajitas with salsa, guacamole, homemade tortilla chips/crisps, and tres leches cake cost around £25-30 a head once I had all the ingredients and everything cooked up: tequila is also far more expensive than it is in the US/Mexico, which is another think to remember) have expressed how my food is too spicy. I say the same thing about vindaloo, so go figure. Think about it this way... while some people love it, you'll always have to be making two batches: you have to cater to the lowest common denominator in terms of spice and also the maniacs, like me, who think habanero should be on everything.

Food permits are not too difficult to get, just depends on where the location is and the alcohol licensing. Property will fluctuate in terms of price dependent on location -- and no, I will not tell you the location I chose because I still may open it, I am just not in Birmingham currently.. still I don't want competition when I am back ;) -- and the areas of biggest footfall will be expensive. With Bodega already popular and benefiting from loyal customers (though I think it is rubbish), the area around New Street would be difficult to break, and you may find around St. Paul's that the food wouldn't be so well received (I hesitate to say ""snobs"", but ...snobs); well, unless you marketed it towards the young hotshot middle class.

You also need to consider who is your target, who will come in, and how do you get them to stay? Birmingham is home to the Balti Triangle and when people want quick, exotic, spicy, cheap dishes they head there: especially students. This decision has to be up to you. Do you want families, do you want the middle class, do you want students, do you want a Michelin star? Do you want young professionals? Do you want business lunches? Do you want it to be a romantic spot for dinner? Do you want it be the place for Sunday brunch? Do you want, do you want, do you want? Because realistically, no restaurant is all of those things. 

Finally, how much would you be willing to pay for a taco? Everyone wants everything for free.

China's CO2 emissions rose 10% in 2010 [source](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/08/us-energy-bp-emissions-idUSTRE75728120110608)

From [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carbon_dioxide_emissions_due_to_consumption_in_China.png) chart I am going to estimate co2 emissions from china in 2009 were 7,800 million metric tons(Mt)

The 10% Chinese increase from 2009 to 2010 represents 780 million Mt of Co2. The estimated total output of Co2 for the UK in 2009was 473.7 million Mt [Source](http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/stat_09_ghg/stat_09_ghg.aspx)

**so**

Based on on 2008 source cited by OP, China is already producing over 57 times more CO2 that the UK.

The *10% increase alone* in Co2 emissions by China for 2009 to 2010 was *over one and a half times the total output of the United Kingdom.*

From [this](http://www.worldclimatereport.com/index.php/2011/04/14/biggest-drop-in-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions/) it seems unlikely that China's Co2 emissions are going to be reducing any time soon.

Regarding global Co2 output, I would argue that cutting our Co2 emissions by 1% or 100% will have the net effect of bugger all.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; I never felt there was a ""culture war"" to be fought, we are all part of the western culture. USA being the biggest economy of the western block is going to have a big influence in it, but I never felt ""conquered"". Europe still feels different than the states, and so is South America.

Before WW2 there were far more differences between British and American culture, and other European nations. There still are differences, but not so much for the UK as we share a common language, which makes it easier for US culture to permeate. Just look at the British film industry as an example, if I go to my 2 local cinemas it's often a case that there are no British films being shown. 

&gt; In this continent we are not that obsessed with religion or have that extreme patriotism that they have. And we are not even the same among the many countries that conform the UE.

Catholic countries tend to be more preoccupied with religion, but even in the UK religion has far more impact on society than you would imagine considering how few people are actively religious these days. 

As for patriotism, most European nations have been there, done that. Just look at the UK a century ago for an example, the jingoism surrounding the Great War isn't that dissimilar to American attitudes to the post-9/11 war on terrorism. The only difference is that we got to see exactly where it leads to and paid the price in blood. 

&gt; The other enraging thing about that comment is that he assumed that the kid hated america for not reason at all, is like they want to feel they are hated and persecuted when most of us don't give a flying fuck about it.

I think many Americans are very aware of why they are disliked as a nation in some parts of the world, but far less aware of why they may be disliked as an individual who happens to be American. It's also worth remembering that they are thousands of miles away from Europe, and in many cases don't speak the language. So the only things that are translated tend to be at the extremes.

true,dangercart,lfc68,,"Here are a few:

* Ownership:  They are a competent group working to put an efficient, sustainable model in place for the club.  They will also spend for the right players
* Manager:  We will have a new manager and, while we won't know how well he'll do until the season is underway, it gives us something to talk about and look forward to
* Player development:  I'm not a Carroll fan but he was clearly better at the end of the season than the beginning.  I also think Henderson played better once he moved inside.  We should expect Coates to improve as he comes into the team and some of the youngsters (Sterling, Suso, Robinson, Coady) to do the same.
* Luis Suarez:  He's really, really good and hopefully won't have an eight game suspension in the middle of next season.
* Returning players:  If the managers we are being linked to in the media are legitimate, we may be employing a system that fits Cole and/or Aquilani better which would be a nice boost, considering we are already paying them.
* Lucas:  Hopefully he returns as good as new.  Actually he kind of sucked when he was new so let's say good as recent.
*  New signings:  We will be signing some players once our management team is in place and, probably, the Euros are over.
* Steven Gerrard:  You get to watch one of the best players ever to wear our shirt for at least a few more seasons.  Relish it while you can.

Last but not least, luck.  Fans hate to hear this but luck plays a part in sports and we had it pretty bad last year.  The odds of a team creating as many chances as we did and only scoring as many as we did is pretty slim.  We also hit woodwork 143,752 times (approximate) and missed 5/6 league penalties.  If you believe at all in sports statistics, we will regress to the mean next season and score more goals.  Our defensive fundamental statistics were really good (so our low goals against was not luck) when our first choice back six (Reina to Lucas) was available so more goals scored and a similar defensive record means more wins.  Wins are fun and you should be optimistic about seeing more of them.  Especially at home.

I think the club has a ton of work to do to make fourth next season (and win the title this decade) but there are reasons to be optimistic, too.",0,1338293854,null,0,false,0,c4tm9nt,t3_u9bvb,t1_c4tm9nt,t3_u9bvb,null,1429022091,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

If you're comparing it to every third world style country or war torn state then obviously the US is going to come out looking good. Even if you contrast the US against Mexico or Russia it still comes out looking pretty damn good.     

Where the US really falls down is when you start to contrast it against the EU or other former common-wealth countries like Canada and Australia.    

Unfortunately I think once upon a time the US was a really awesome place full of great opportunities but since then it has been bought and paid for by big corporation and as a result the US's development has either stopped or they are slowly rolling backwards.     

The entire ""system"" there seems to be almost engineered around trying to get people enslaved into their jobs and then stripping the few rights they had protecting them from employer's potential abuse:      

 - Safety nets removed, restricted, or are seen as hugely negative (thanks in a large part to the constant bombardment from US media/""news"" organisations all owned by a few rich billionaires).      
 - Health Insurance over 100% more expensive for the self-employed or unemployed.     
 - Health Insurance linked almost entirely to your ability to pay.    
 - Once you're sick it is almost impossible to get insurance except via employment.    
 - Medicade and Medicare constantly get more restrictive (e.g. ""if you can pay rent you can pay for your health care!"").     
 - Health care bills still excessively high even WITH health insurance.    
 - Insurance firms can drop people when they get sick. Employers have additional motivation to fire people when they get sick (as the employer has added costs).    
 - ""Right to work"" (read: right to terminate without notice, reason, or ability to appeal).     
 - No paid holidays at all. No paid sick leave. No paid maternity/paternity leave.    
 - Public transport initiatives constantly attacked by ""big oil"" (via proxies) to keep people in their car's and to keep the US government subsidising oil instead of alternatives/public transport.     
 - No maximum hours/day in many states. No real legislation on over-time.

I was too young (13) in 2006 to appreciate soccer, so I didnt pay much attention after the WC ended.

Anyways 2010 rolls around and I watched that world cup, and got a proper appreciation for the sport. I watched the final with my dad at about 5am, and he remarked how Spain's star goal scorer was injured and on the bench. He was talking about Torres. Anyway, Torres came on and did his Hammy (is that the big injury that fucked up his pace? Been wondering for over a year). I felt bad for him and wikipediaed him.

Then I looked up his club, saw that it was part of the traditional top 4. I saw the table on wikipedia that said we had been out of the top 4 and struggling under Hodgson, and I thought that Liverpool must be a good club going through a bad period, and that they would recover.

I wanted to pick a team that would compete for things, but I didnt like Man U because I thought SAF was arrogant and a bit of a twat. I never considered Arsenal, and I thought Chelsea lacked culture. 

I liked Liverpool best because it had that club culture, and the legends like Shankly and Dalglish. 

First match I watched was the game at Molineux where Torres scored. I've watched every game I could since then, bought foxtel so I can watch HD matches and not a laggy stream, and basically become emotionally invested over the past 15 months.

That said I don't see how trying to reduce Co2 will actually make cock-all difference to the global output of Co2. I think driving a reduction in Co2 emissions from the UK to try to reduce global output is a pointless effort, I'm hoping by throwing a few figures around I can show this.

I'm all for reducing Co2 emissions in the UK for the former reason. I feel the current governmental reasoning for attempted Co2 reduction is disingenuous, which makes me wonder what other motivations are being served, such as excuses to levy higher 'energy' taxes for instance.

Sometimes temp positions land full time jobs, but I wouldn't count on it since the employer will be charged a 'finders fee' by the recruitment agency (something like £1500) to hire you, so it very often isn't worth it.

There are other options like going through the job centre too, though. There are a few sponsored college courses and the like available now that you can use to tune up your skill set whilst you get some benefits to hopefully sustain yourself.

That's just it though, not expecting to have to go the extra mile to get a job is a very middle class sentiment. Unskilled workers have always been in a crowded marketplace, so working late for no extra pay or having your shifts changed at the last minute is the type of thing you put up with if you want to keep your job. This was never an issue for the middle classes, as there were far fewer qualified and educated people to compete for the same positions, something that has changed now. If you want to get ahead you have to do the grunt work.

These things may not have been an expectation in your parents' day, but back then, *far* fewer people were qualified to do those kind of jobs. The fallout of more people going to university or going onto training programmes is that you have to do more to stand out from the crowd.

Trying to moved the Armed Forces from a respected line of work to a more heroic and patriotic place. Sort of how the Armed Forces are seen in the US. 

3. Of course, all 3 branches provide excellent training and the chance of a life long career. If you don't stay in after your years are up, then having served is a valuable thing to have on your CV.

I was brought on as a seasonal gardener at my local council over three summers, full time hours and the exact same wage as a lot of the permanent workers (those who did the same job but had higher ranks, specialist duties and training got more pay - more than fair in my book). Did I rest on my laurels because of it? No. If anything I worked my absolute arse off in order to keep up and earn my wage, and I guarantee that barely within weeks I was just as, if not more, productive as some of the other workers.

If you're proofreading and polishing an existing letter then ask yourself how many changes do you make as a result of that proofreading? If you're making a lot then your initial writing skills need work, if you're not making any then your proofreading is excessive.

By all means tailor your application for each individual job but recognise that, from the hiring point of view, candidates break down into:

* 50% illiterate (simple spalling err0rs or grammer innit, lol), rejection
* 30% irrelevant (we make widgets, your background is in english lit), rejection
* 20% possibles, will read a second time

On the second pass that 20% will get cut in half on gut feeling (nothing seems interesting or noteworthy), that leaves 10% who might get an interview. Ideally get someone else to cut them in half again based on gut feeling, or just pick some at random (we have 1 post to fill, and 10% of 100 applications is 9 people too many - we only have time to interview 5: interviews take up the employer's time, and they don't make money by performing interviews).

That might seem quite arbitrary, but from the employer's POV they are planning to spend 15-30K on the person they hire - that's a lot of money and hiring the wrong people enough times can easily put you out of business.

Your goal when applying should be to pass these initial filters. Your application needs to be clear and concise, free from any obvious errors, and both relevant and interesting (if you're particularly interesting you might get by with being less relevant, but ""interesting"" is very subjective).

That gets you into the final 10%, and even then it can be random chance that determines if you'll get an interview (but the other 90% never even got that far).

Convincing someone to hire you is an uphill struggle and, frankly, always has been. The alternative is to create your own job.",0,1338302785,null,0,false,0,c4tnmud,t3_ua5wb,t1_c4tnmud,t3_ua5wb,null,1429022735,20,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,20

It's definitely a difficult time for graduates - this is one that is certainly related to the state of the economy.

Big companies cannot afford to hire, even government sector jobs are put on hold while they wait for people to retire.
