There's also no reason the Doctor can't be lied to. River Song put that chapter heading in a book because she knows it's in the book. It doesn't necessarily make it so. The only evidence we have that this is their last meeting is because the book says so.

If 1938 is blocked off, go to 1937 and hang out for a year or so. Or 1939. Or 1972, or... How far is this 'nogo zone' for New York 1938 extending, temporally or spatially? Also, try popping back to 1937, reserving a couple of train tickets to California for 1938 under the name of 'Williams', and meeting up with them a year later far, far away from New York. 

Don't forget to pop back a few years from the present and make a fake tombstone also. The writing changes on it when Amy chooses to follow Rory, sure, but it could have changed simply because the lie got bigger.

I realise Moffat's trying to give the two of them a permanent farewell, and for the most part it works. But if they don't end up showing up in the 50th anniversary specials, I'll buy a hat and eat it. After all, look at Rose, trapped forever in a place where the Doctor could never get to her.

No one else in the city is even discussed or made aware of the threat besides the collector guy and the detective, so it doesn't make sense for something that would obviously capture the entire city's attention.

Of course, an Angels episode where they do manage to capture the entire city's attention would be really hard to pull off because it would be easy for everyone to watch the angels when there are so many people aware of them - in order to be scary the angels really have to be going after a relatively small group of people so that they can't all be watched easily.

James is the most socially liberal of the three; he also opposes gay marriage but is fully in favour of women bishops.

In terms of the management of the Church, Sentamu is a bit of an authoritarian and doesn't brook dissent, Welby has at least managed outside organisations before (oil industry) and James is a long-standing competent manager but lacking in charisma.

Out of the three, I think I'd want Graham James, but he only just edged out Welby as the more inspiring candidate if only because a well-run and beefed up Lambeth Palace could stand up to Church House a little more.

true,knockturnal,mccoy,McCoy,"So, I've justified a lot of the clashes between classic and modern with that argument. For example, in the classic series the Daleks in 2160 don't know who the Doctor is, while in the modern series the Daleks before AND after that time know him as their enemy.

true,lol_oopsie,null,null,"Honestly, the article doesn't say much - it reads more like an attack piece on privatisation, rather than anything which is informative or useful. I worked in a lab like this for a while and what they're saying in the article doesn't sound that bad to me. The biggest problem is that the article gives no comparison to other labs (whether NHS or private), so how is anybody supposed to understand the degree of ""failures"" or not.

i.e. 
&gt; 400 clinical incidents in 2011 – including losing and mislabelling samples 

That lab will easily be doing 3000 samples per day = 1.1 million samples per year. 400 lost or mislabelled samples doesn't sound that bad now in that context. And when I worked in the lab, mis-labeling or losing samples was the most common type of error, caused by nurses/doctors not filling in forms properly, and also errors by lab staff.

But without comparison to other hospitals, or a national average, how are we supposed to how whether 400 errors per year is good, bad or normal?

&gt;In January 2012 a patient ""received inappropriate blood due to patient history not being flagged"" – an incident the company says it took very seriously. 

Labs don't diagnose people - they provide numbers. And it is the responsibility of the clinical staff on the wards to check things. Doctors should be bearing clinical history in mind before issuing blood to a patient. Again, it sounds like partly the labs' fault for not bearing patient history in mind, but clinicians shouldn't just blindly give blood either.

&gt;One scientist speaking anonymously told of low morale and said: ""Staff who used to work collaboratively together are now in competition with each other over jobs.""

Could be said for the changes which have happened in almost ANY job in the UK, whether public or private. I find this ""article"" to be nothing more than an attack without any real substance.

Note: I think this would also mean that the person that Amy sees for the last time, sees Amy for the last time then, as well.

* Downvotes, especially for comments and self-posts, are not meant for things that you disagree with, downvotes are for things that do not add to the discussion. Downvote trolls and all that. This post isn't worthy of the amount of downvotes it has, in my mind.
* Cultural differences could account your misunderstanding. I'm a foreign fan as well and it takes a while to pick up on the rivalries between certain clubs. To English fans, those rivalries could go beyond sport, especially a London/Liverpool rivalry. Also having to constantly be around Spurs/QPR/Arsenal/etc fans will make you more inclined to dislike them. 
* It's not exactly like we're the only ones who are like that. I know there's the high road and all that, and I personally try to follow that as best as I can, but there are limits. For example, [this was the top post of /r/gunners before we beat them yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/10m5ok/as_a_reminder_for_tomorrow_lets_kick_racism_out/). 
* Not sure if it makes much of a difference but we're not disrespectful towards any individuals, but rather a group. I don't personally hate each and every Arsenal fan but I don't like Arsenal so I don't like their fans. The difference is subtle but important I think.

Overall we could probably be more polite and respectful. If someone behaves a certain way that I don't like or agree with, my response isn't to emulate that behavior - rise above it, be the better person. No point lowering yourself. That said, OP I think you might be taking it a bit too seriously because this does happen in all sports. Other subreddits do seem to get along better, like /r/nfl and r/hockey. The hate is there because it's part and parcel of being a fan, but it still is pretty funny (see the top comment on this thread) and second, it's not personal, it's not directed to individuals. 

Personally I hope you're able to see past it and continue to enjoy yourself around here, we try to make it nice for everyone!

Life with the Doctor is dangerous and chaotic at the best of times. Every time the Ponds were to have an encounter with the Doctor, the potential for a destructive time event would be everpresent. With their end point ""fixed"", their status as companions becomes extremely problematic.

true,aeoden34,null,null,"A lot of the things I'm reading here have an element of truth to them. But lets just look at what the episode tells us.

1. New York is an area that has a lot of diverging time lines. Basically, it's a mess. The time lines here are so messed up, it's very difficult to travel in time here. Like ""landing in a snow storm"". This was pre-paradox. The Tardis actually bounced off of the timeline once, and was sent crashing back to the present. Hence why he  went back in time to put those markings on the vase. ""Yowzah"" was a signal to River. This let her know he was trying to get back, and so she sent him a signal, or ""landing lights"". Even with a signal to lock on to, the Tardis had a hell of a time actually breaching the timeline.

2. We also know that directly knowing ones own future cements it in stone. Changing it creates a paradox. This could be a big part of the reason the timelines are so messed up in the first place. By Rory knowing his future, and then willingly changing it, it created a paradox that completely destroyed that timeline. Everything in it that had been directly involved had to correct itself for a new reality. This threw the Doctor, Rory, Amy and River out of the time line. They simply didn't belong because the events that drew them there never happened.

3. The paradox that caused this did a huge amount of damage to New York's time line. NOW, hypothetically speaking, this damage is only in New York. If Rory and Amy were to relocate away from this general area, perhaps the Doctor could breach back into that time stream. Or, if he were to materialize elsewhere and travel there in another fashion, he could otherwise find his way back to them. That's merely hypothetical though.

4. The New York Paradox, as earlier stated, caused a huge amount of damage to the time stream of that area. Once could argue that this is the event that caused the Tardis having such issues breaching it in the first place. what we do know, however, is that when Rory was sent back a second time, it would require a SECOND paradox to get him back. Impossible. Doing so would merely decimate everything there. The Tardis would be unlikely to even breach this time anyway. But even if it did, this second Paradox would destroy New York. Completely changing realities like that again would merely break them completely.

5. Now we come to OP's post, which has a lot of merit. He had an idea this would happen. As did they. They needed to make a choice. And their choice was, no matter where they were, all that mattered was that they were together. It's taken 2 and a half series for them to learn this, and to realize how important they are to each other. But there you are. COULD they be retrieved? Obviously. River sent Amy the book to be published. Remember, as far as we know, this anomaly is only in the Manhattan area. She could write them at any time, and tell them to relocate to X area at X time, and the Doctor could pick them up. Not doing so is a personal choice. River understands that it was time for them to move on. So do Rory and Amy. They have each other now, and are happy. Once you get past all the jargon, time collapsing calamities, etc, it comes down to the fact that they needed this. Yes, it broke the doctors heart(s), but still...the ending is happy enough, as endings go. They had each other. Not everyone gets that.

Addendum: Time travel is a complex issue, so I have to retract part of my statement. The Ponds could hypothetically be ""rescued"". But, they must ALWAYS die in New York. Them NOT dying or at the very least being buried there would cause a paradox as well. I could be off base in other areas as well.

true,laldans,smith,Smith,"My theory is that it went like this:

Asylum of the Daleks &gt; The Power of Three &gt; The Angels take Manhattan &gt; A Town called Mercy &gt; Dinosaurs on a Spaceship.

Basically, Asylum of the Daleks is the first story chronologically in the season. He soon afterwards goes to Earth and finds the cubes, resulting in him staying a year. Amy and Rory then rejoin the Doctor. They travel a while, and end up in Central Park, New York, where the events of The Angels take Manhattan happen. This is the last time Rory and Amy see the Doctor.

The Doctor then returns to Rory and Amy for two more trips, A Town called Mercy and Dinosaurs on a Spaceship. In both cases he asked them to travel with him some more, as he knew that they had only two times left to travel on the TARDIS. He could not, however, tell them this, as this would create a paradox. 

I think A Town called Mercy was before Dinosaurs on a Spaceship because of his reaction. In A Town called Mercy he's disappointed, yes, but in Dinosaurs on a Spaceship he's really hurt. He knows it's the very last time he'll ever see them in the TARDIS and he can never tell them. 

One problem I've found myself with this theory is how he could have known that they travelled with him two more times before, I'm not sure if this is ever mentioned in the episodes. Also, I'm not sure how Brian fits into this, I'm not sure if he knew the Doctor in The Power of Three or not, or if he already knew him in Dinosaurs on a Spaceship.

He can go back to before he took then to NYC and try to stop himself but we know how that goes (Father's day), which is of course compounded by the massive paradox Rory created falling off the building. 

Second he could attempt to go back to the point where they are in time, unfortunately though this requires him to alter the timeline that he is now part of as soon as he read that gravestone. I am unsure if attempting to go back and interact with them would count as crossing his own timeline, or just altering a fixed point but either way it is ill advised during normal circumstances.

Them witnessing the event solidified it as a fixed point in time, so in order to avoid it, Amy and Rory kill themselves in order to create a paradox (If Rory died, there is no way he could have seen himself die of old age). The paradox makes it so the event never happened, and they're kicked back to present day NYC. At the end of the episode, Rory sees his name on his grave, causing another fixed point in time. An Angel sneaks up behind him and sends him into the past once more. The doctor knows that he cannot go back into Rory's timeline (and create another paradox), so Rory is effectively stuck in the past. Amy voluntarily chooses to spend the remainder of her life with Rory by having the angel send her back in time. Amy and Rory live happily ever after in the past and Amy's name appears next to Rory's on the gravestone. The doctor is effectively locked out from their lives.

Second: It is almost definitely the Doctor's name that the Silence fear will be revealed in the field of trenzalore. 

Third: There is at least one solid theory that hypothesizes that the doctor might be a reincarnation of one of the original three time lords from the loom.

So we know that basically no time lord reveals there name, but we do not know why. We also know it is possible that the Doctor is THE time lord. Not just a time lord.

When you're in a bad way, a programme that insists that people are incredible - that they're brilliant, they're moral, they always persevere, that we are not alone - can be incredibly powerful. The message is about more than a time-travelling alien - it's about how, even in the darkest of times, humanity (and its members) can always find a friend. Its about how everyone is worth a chance. It's about the importance of our actions - one man and his ordinary humans save entire worlds through sheer force of their efforts, and why?

Because everyone is worth saving.

So don't feel bad about watching the show, and don't listen to those who make fun of you for watching it - it's powerful for a lot of people. There is so much more to Doctor Who than a lot of people realise. Just because they can't see it doesn't mean they're right.

To me, it came across more like he was saying ""I mustn't do this because it would be morally wrong"" rather than ""We mustn't do this because flying demons will attack us.""  The way he got upset at being asked suggested it was something he could theoretically do, but had to resist the temptation.

I really like the Rose and Pete and Jackie stuff in ""Father's Day"" -- that part is excellent.  And the idea that seeing something happen with your own eyes and then going back in time and making it not happen causes a weird breakdown in time and things keep looping around until it's fixed, that's fine too.

*there was indeed a real-life ""FD12 MK VII"" - the ""Mark 7"" version of the ""FD12"" diesel engine/generator for ships, designed by a firm called Foden (a British manufacturer of trucks and vans). Foden trucks often used Rolls-Royce engines, so Rolls-Royce Motors might have built the FD12 as part of a deal between the two firms. Incidentally, some people have pointed out that the sign bears a ""NATO Stock No"" field, and wondered why. Apparently, FD12s were used in some Royal Navy vessels, so it would be logical for them to have a NATO part number.*

When Biff gets out of the DeLorean in 2015 you can see he is already writhing in pain, I'm attributing this to him being in the process of being re-written.

And the Doctor can't get them for several reasons.

1. the Doctor read in the book, ""Amelia's Last Farewell"". When Amy said ""Goodbye, raggedy man"", It was her farewell, that was last. He read it, so it was a fixed point.

2. The tombstone had their deathdate on it. If he took them away, the tombstone would not be there, which means Rory and Amy might not have been there for the Angel to zap away, which means they didn't go back. Boom. Paradox.

3. New York is currently a paradox mess. If the Doctor tried to time travel there, it would result in a big new york boom. So, yeah.

Of course, I'm not sure that it's a stable causal loop to say that ""headstone with Rory's name causes Rory to stop long enough for the angel to catch up with him and send him back to cause him to die and be buried before that day"". The headstone seems like a pure causal product, so I don't think it makes sense for it to also be the thing that triggers the loop... at least, it's not congruent with the other causal products we see--young Rory seeing old Rory doesn't *cause* him to be caught by an Angel, it just introduces the possibility of a paradox if he doesn't, which could mean the web of time will try to ensure that Rory would be sent back in time.",0,1349068049,null,0,false,0,c6fv2xt,t3_10pgl6,t1_c6fv2xt,t1_c6fqx7h,null,1430033373,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

We know she dies at a specific place in a specific time, but she travels all over time and space on both sides of that event before actually ending her timeline there. Likewise, the gravestone only says that the Ponds' bodies eventually reach that graveyard at some point before TATM, but it doesn't say they have a strictly linear timeline from the graveyard scene to, well, the graveyard.

Likewise, we have an example of something like the afterward proving not to be absolute--the Doctor's death. On the surface, it makes sense that it's absolutely factual, and is widely recorded as fact, including in the Tesselecta's database. In the end, though, it was a carefully planned construction meant to mislead. It's a lot easier to provide misleading and fictional information on a piece of paper than it is in real life with several involved witnesses.

But it's very unlikely that Moffat would do that, even though there's still the whole ""every beginning has a beginning, middle, and end--but not necessarily in that order"" bit they've been using in ads for this season.

Like Captain Jack Harkness, Rory had a tendency to die and be brought back to life, although he did not have Harkness' gift/curse of immortality and his resurrections were done in a variety of ways.


Rory was killed by a Eknodine in a dream created by the Dream Lord. Amy and the Doctor committed suicide in the dream and were returned to another dream, in which Rory was still alive. The Doctor then killed all three of them in the dream by blowing up the TARDIS, having figured out that the Dream Lord had created two dreams. (TV: Amy's Choice)


Rory was killed by the Silurian Restac. Soon after, his body was consumed by the Time Field and he was erased from time. However due to Amy's subconscious memories of him, he was resurrected as an Auton duplicate. (TV: Cold Blood, The Pandorica Opens)


Rory's duplicate was erased from history when the Doctor restarted the universe and the real Rory was brought back to life. However, the Auton Rory lived on in the real Rory, as he remembered the 2000 years he spent waiting. (TV: The Big Bang)


Rory faked his death at the hands of Canton Delaware in order to trick the Silence. (TV: Day of the Moon)


Rory drowned (or at least came very close to doing so) when he fell into the sea but was rescued by the Siren and brought back to life by Amy. (TV: The Curse of the Black Spot)


An old version of Rory died when the House took over the TARDIS. (TV: The Doctor's Wife)


A future version of Rory was seen dying in a bed. (TV: The Angels Take Manhattan)


Rory and Amy both sacrificed themselves to kill the Weeping Angels since Rory had already seen himself die and by throwing themselves off a roof, he and Amy created a paradox which was poison to the Angels. The paradox cancelled the timeline so Amy and Rory both came back to life. (TV: The Angels Take Manhattan)


Rory and Amy both died of old age after being sent back in time by a surviving Weeping Angel. This time they both died permanently. (TV: The Angels Take Manhattan)",0,1349069980,null,0,false,0,c6fvf4a,t3_10qubl,t1_c6fvf4a,t3_10qubl,null,1430033533,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

A friend had us watch Rose, and I just kept watching.

Doctor Who helped me accept the responsibility of being an adult. Through complicated events, I was very much still a teenager through most of college. But the show helped me accept reality and stand up for my priorities and ideals.

And now, the show helps me figure out how to be the best person possible for my fiance. I've taken more inspiration from Rory and the Doctor these last few seasons than any other example of men and their loved ones I can think of. It's thanks to Doctor Who that I know I can be there for my fiance, and can live as an adult in this frankly terrifying world.

But, some people don't resonate with stories that much. They don't understand the power of the narrative to inspire hope and compassion and courage. So they mock. Feel sorry for them, if they can't look to tales of amazement, because they're facing this world without the fantastic zipping about their brains giving them dreams of a better future.

He isn't happy about it, but knowing that Amy and Rory get to live their full lives with each other is too much to risk. I know I wrote this in another thread, but this isn't like with Rose. With Rose there was 0% chance of getting her back. We have seen the Doctor warp and fake his way around fixed points before, but here it's simply no longer worth the risk to him.

He has to put them behind him because it's the only way that he can be sure that they will be happy. And that is not something that the Doctor does. He has always been about finding a way to have his cake and eat it too. Every major sacrifice along they way, he has had back up plans and ways to make sure that he gets what he wants if at all possible. Here, he has a slim chance to go get the Williams/Ponds and buck reality again, but he simply understands that the only way to make sure Amy and Rory win is that he must lose.

Add 1 cup of very hot water (the amount of water you add here determines the final volume of dough, so tailor it to how big your pan is).

And you know what? That's fine.
Really, it's fine.

Everyone has their preference on what they like and it ultimately breaks down to what type of appreciation you have for it. Some people like watching those singing/talent shows to get a glimpse of the next big thing or just to watch people make fools of themselves.

I was there, man. 2 and a half years ago lying on the floor in my apartment in the dead of winter freezing my ass off, contemplating how long it would take for someone to find my body if I were to just check out. I think I calculated a week, and it would only be because of my job trying to find out where I was. I wasn't doing well in school, didn't have much money, no girlfriend, and the only human contact I got was from work or going out to the grocery store for food. I avoided my friends like the plague, because I didn't think they quite understood the depths of how shit I felt.

I still feel alone, but the biggest difference from then and now is that I don't view it as a burden. I'm 23, and if you're much younger than me then I must say you might have some interesting years ahead of you.

But the thing that always gets me through are my hobbies and quirky things that make me who I am. Appreciate who you are for yourself first and foremost, please.

A favorite lyric of mine from a Ben Howard song is...
""Keep your head up, keep your heart strong.""

Speaking of Ben Howard, there's a song he has that is helping me through this whole Amy and Rory ordeal. It hits me right in the feels, but it's the good kind of pain. Sometimes you just gotta sit there, listen to music, and let the emotions roll out man.

true,Quazifuji,null,null,"&gt;The Doctor losing companions, in one way or another, is par for the course.

Doesn't mean it's not sad.  And consider the role Amy had with him.  She was more than just a normal companion, I think.  Remember, the 11th Doctor's story so far has taken place over 300 years so far, while 9 and 10 only added up to about 10 years.  And Amy's been his main companion the whole time.  He hasn't always been traveling with her that whole time, but she's always been there as a sort of presence for him.  She was the first person he met as 11, the first person he traveled with as 11, he's watched her grow up from a little girl to a kissogram getting cold feet about her wedding to a mother, he even married her daughter.  She really has a huge amount of significance to him.  And now she's gone.  Think about what it did to the Doctor to lose Rose, and he'd only known her for two years.  He just lost Amy after 300.

Now, I think you can say it wasn't tragic.  As you said, Amy and Rory did, in a way, get a happy ending.  It could have been happier - they didn't get to spend the rest of their lives traveling with the Doctor, they never got to see their families again, they may never have seen their own daughter again (it's not clear whether River directly gave the info about the book to Amy or just delivered a message from further in the past as she often does).

It was the surprise I wanted out of this story...explaining how the heck Melody got from a baby regeneration at the end of The Day of the Moon to being Mels in in the early 90s or so. They had a perfectly lovely opportunity for a montage ending with that.

I agree...looking back Doctor Who has never really pushed for emotional continuity but it seems to get so close sometimes that it's really annoying. I would love to see them do a full run of episodes closely connected with a strong emotional connection and much better pacing than movie of the week. 

Yeah, the ending felt really afterthought. I am hoping they shot stuff they didn't use from New York City for something much later. 

Here's what really bugged me...Amy and Rory just vanish. That's it. We get a voice-over but it's really detached. Rose we get to see her settling in to the parallel earth, not just...*boom* gone. Martha came back from time to time. And even Donna we got to see in a normal life. It was really detaching emotionally to see Rory just blink out after all that and then Amy too. Can't we be given a montage of her with Rory growing old and happy with the voice over? Maybe sneak the Melody raising bit in there? That's why I wonder if this ending was a fake out perpetrated by River and her parents to help the Doctor move on from them or something like that.

The Valeyard isn't a fixed event in time, especially given all the temporal disruption. It was invented by the Time Lords for their needs of the time; I doubt very much that it's still relevant.

true,SCFoximus,troughton,Troughton,"The way I've always seen it is that in BttF when someone time travels backwards in time and changes an event they can no longer return to their exact time line. But, they can return to a similar time line, with varying levels of alterations. We see this throughout the films with Marty; After the first trip the changes are substantial to the McFly family and the Lone Pine Mall in 1985, after the second trip we see Alternate Hill Valley, and after the third trip the Clayton Ravine is called the Eastwood Ravine. It is never the same Hill Valley (or even the same universe) twice. 

That said this must also occur with Biff. So, with that in place, the Old Biff we see return to 2015 should not be the same one who we saw leave. This Old Biff was one that either did not succeed in getting Young Biff the almanac, or perhaps was the one returning already affected by the changes Marty makes on his second trip to 1955. This Biff did not get to see the chanhes into Altrnate Hill Valley. I suppose the deleted scene showing Old Biff disappear could possibly dispute this theory, but as it did not make it into the final cut I'm not going to bother trying to fit that in.

So essentially every choice every person makes every moment affects the time line causing a new time line to be formed, with no two exactly alike, creating an infinite number of universes for a person to find their way into. I believe this works as well with their trips to the future, as now the characters have a foreknowledge another universe would not have, but I haven't paid as close attention to that as we only get to see the one trip.",0,1349079154,null,0,false,0,c6fwn0t,t3_10q7r9,t1_c6fwn0t,t1_c6fuv2t,null,1430034109,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

The only possible argument I can see is that 18-20yr olds are less employable by virtue of their lack of skills and experiences.

 - We have tons of unemployed youth (20%~ in 2010).

 - Giving them a lower minimum wage makes them more competitive for entry level jobs, thus providing them the key experience they need to move up.    

Essentially there are two ""kinds"" of employees entering the job-chain, those who begin work at 16~20 who do so right after school/college and typically get entry level jobs (that's who this is aimed at) and those who get jobs at 21+ who aren't shooting for minimum wage jobs anyway (university leavers).

true,ruderabbit,tennant,Tennant,"Well aside from the return of Moffats pet creations [River Song and the Weeping Angels] it was a rather confused episode that didn't make a lot of sense.

How have the angels turned normal statues into angels? How did they get to New York? Why does moving people through time (something that I would imagine takes a LOT of energy) generate energy? Why do the angels *want* this energy? Why can't the Doctor land in New York? Why has he been able to do it before and not now? Why couldn't he just land the TARDIS in Queens a few hours ago and get a cab to the city, rather than galavanting off to China?

While the idea of the Statue of Liberty becoming an angel is really cool, it was so badly handled. WHY did the Angels do that? I thought the whole point of them was hiding in plain sight. Surely someone is going to notice one of New York city's most famous landmarks wandering off? It makes a pretty crappy assassin. I get the impression ""Angels take Manhattan"" was originally going to have nothing to do with the Amy and Rory subplot, and the idea of them charging up the Statue of Liberty to do something was the gist of the episode. But, instead, we had this whole Rory dying/making a paradox/you can't change the future thing.

This whole bit bugged me on a number of levels. Why isn't the show sticking to the rules it had previously established? Before, when Rose caused a paradox and changed her future, she and the Doctor were attacked by interdimentional space-bats. Why isn't that happening here? If the Hotel stopped EVER existing how did an angel ""escape?"" How can Rory and Amy be transported to somewhere that never existed? If everything at the Hotel *actually happened* why aren't they  a pair of pancakes on a New York pavement? If it's possible to cause a Paradox, why can't the Doctor just go to the hotel and get them?

Which brings me to my biggest complaint of the episode *and* the writing of late: ""Wibbily Wobbily Timey Wimey"" which has gone from a quaint way for the Doctor to explain time travel to humans as if they're children to a universal handwave for the writers if they can't be bothered to explain things.",0,1349081548,null,0,false,0,c6fwunh,t3_10pus8,t1_c6fwunh,t1_c6fu4nu,null,1430034210,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

I certainly wouldn't play Gerrard as a striker. I've read that article posted earlier on whether it could work, but I don't think Gerrard would be suited at all. 

Personally, I'd really like to see Wisdom play a few Europa League/League Cup games at centre-back, which is where I ultimately think he will end up. 

I'd like to see Robinson play some Prem games at left-back. I think he will be our left-back for the next decade or so if he reaches his potential, and it would allow Glen Johnson to switch back to the right, which is where i think he operates best. 

I'm also a bit surprised Suso doesn't make either of your lineups. I wasn't sure that Suso was actually as good as many of us had made out, but I've seen enough from the last few games to be convinced that he could be a really special player for us. 

Here is a team that I'd like to see given a run out in the Prem:

-------------------Reina-------------------

Johnson---Wisdom---Coates---Robinson

------------------Lucas--------------------

Sterling---------------------------Suarez

------------------Borini-------------------

And if you can reduce the cost of a test from £200 to £100, that's a hundred quid more which can be spent on front line care, or on testing on a 20% rather than 40% doctor's judgment of probability.

If its a prem game, I would leave Skrtel and Agger in. I included Wisdom because he's so damn composed. Also dunno if anyone else noticed this, but at times the team shifted into 3 at the back with Johnson roaming far up the pitch. Because Wisdom has experience as a CB, this allows Johnson to go farther up more often, which he does. Check it out in the Norwich game. Rodgers seems to balance the full backs, with one being more attack minded and one being able put in double duty as a makeshift CB. I feel this is why Enrique has been left out and Kelly was given starts. Kelly and Wisdom both are able to cover CB and are less attack oriented. When Johnson and Enrique both started, our backline because very vulnerable because both fullbacks would run up the pitch leaving Allen/Skrtel/Agger to deal with counter attacks. i think this is the same reason Robinson hasn't been getting as many chances. Notice in Europa games, Wisdom is still the RB. I think Rodgers likes the option of transitioning into 3 at the back during a match.


I didn't include Suso, but thats the point of the post, we have so many talented players that its going to be tough to choose who plays our Premier games! I rate shelvey higher than him in the midfield and personally think Suso kills it when he's on the right wing. he's the next david silva.

This series has had several continuing strands: the increasing anonymity of the Doctor, and the universe forgetting his name, the riddle of Oswin and her imminent reappearance, and of course the story of the Ponds, their relationship and departure.  And a lot of comedy, tragedy, and adventure.  Sorry you found it pointless though. 

I was going to respond more fully, but reading on, your palpable anger is offputting.  Easier to say I just disagree with you, and leave it at that.

Genuinely sad for you that you can't bring yourself to enjoy a show that I think is currently mostly brilliant, but don't think for a moment that it is my responsibility to help you with this.

By completely disregarding the clear rules set up in ""Blink"" for plot convenience and ""OOOOOH BUT THE ANGELS ARE EVEN SCARIER AND BIGGER LOL"" nonsense that you get in TATM, it really ruined them as villains.  There are angels in a hallway, converging on a person standing between them with their eyes uncovered.  The conclusion of ""Blink"" revolves around a moment just like this, in which the Angels timelock each other.  And yet, in this one, they're completely immune to those effects.

The cowboy cyborg was baloney, since he could teleport yet could not enter town and take the surgeon, but had to demand he be turned over? That's what's called an idiot plot, for what the viewer has to be to accept it for one minute..

Nothing was accomplished.  The sacrifices were not earned.  The entire mythology of the angels has gotten so byzantine and convoluted I don't even know what to do with what were once great, scary villains.

A chapter name doesn't tell you what happens in the chapter.  In fact, good chapter names often subvert your expectations. Similarly, a grave stone is not a corpse or a death certificate.  It's a stone with writing on it.  Rory doesn't say, ""I see my own gravestone.""  He says, ""SOMEONE ELSE with my name is buried here""  How can you quantum lock yourself into a future when you don't acknowledge what you've seen as, well, *your* future?

The Moffat run has been characterized by exceptional performances by Matt Smith, Karen Gillan, Arthur Darville and, to a less extent, Alex Kingston.  Increasingly I believe the strength of these performances has been in spite of Moffat instead of because of Moffat.  For as wonderful as the 11/Pond relationship has been, the Moffat run as a whole has felt far smaller and somehow more like a soap opera, rather than the grand adventure I felt much more often with 9/10 under RTD.  I'm sad that Amy and Rory are gone because they were great characters who had great chemistry with each other and with 11.  I cannot be sad about what happened to them because, in large part, it made no sense and because there was no drama or scope to their sacrifice.  There was no logic to that gravestone being there.  There was no logic to that angel being there either.  ",0,1349087877,null,0,false,0,c6fxc4f,t3_10ql7r,t1_c6fxc4f,t3_10ql7r,null,1430034437,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

This is giving Moffat more credit than I'm wont, but its a perfectly sound explanation to say they had the hotel of cyclical snackage deal going because they were severely reduced at that point. This idea is backed up by the fact that disposable crime guy actually had one chained up, and a bunch of their /kids/ in the basement. 

If the story was at all concerned with cohesion, we'd get an episode dealing with why they're there in the first place, and that weakening, but since it isnt, we wont. 

And that weakening is basically the message this episode had - the pattering of feet being the most undeniable bit. But if they're that slow, then the statue cant blink-zip acrost the entire bay. So, okay, they're doing the conceptual and slightly unreal thing here - it existed in the posted, pops on out when its time to deal with something on the roof, a sort of grand scale backstab style attack, a last ditch moment for anyone trying to stare at the stairwell. 

Only, if it's the last guard, it makes no sense for it not to have snatched them while they're derping about on the ledge. Or when they've fallen off it. 

Bottom line -  the statue's appearances make no bloody sense, and any cohesive explanation for one aspect of behavior. Another problem is how the whole thing is just really jarring , since half of a lot of the stories is explaining why the heck a given critter is where it is, and why its acting violently. None of that here, beyond the implication of crime guy snagging their kids, without explaining how it happened, why they were reintroduced into this location and time period, etc.

I agree that he does not have chemistry with the actress who plays River--but having watched a ton of television and film, I've noticed that chemistry between actors is actually WAY more rare than I'd thought, so I wouldn't think he's gay just for that reason.  Recently I've been watching Eureka--holy straight people with no chemistry, Batman. Hardly anybody on that show seems to have any chemistry with any of the people they are romantically paired with, it's truly bizarre--but whatever, actors and directors have to just do their best with what they've got. You can't just not have romantic storylines because none of your actors have that spark together.

Matt does show chemistry with his co-stars--but I have not seen it with the females. I mean consider how devastatingly gorgeous Karen Gillan was in seasons 5 and 6. There was a certain stretch of episodes where the girl just had that rare combination of absolutely enviable genes, a masterful makeup artist, a gifted hairstylist who knew what looks flattered her the most, a cameraman who obviously loved her, and a job to do that made her happy (happiness = one of the best things for a person's looks). Many actresses will have one or two of those things at some point in their career--but to have it all come together creates this irresistible woman who you have to work to pry your eyes off of. Matt acted out episode after episode next to her without appearing to even notice. As I mentioned in my previous post--even when David Tennant was portraying Georgia Moffett's *father*, you could catch a certain twinkle in his eye--and who could blame him. With Matt I see that with him and at least that one particular male actor.

As to your second point, you've made an enormous leap from my post to saying I've hated everything about the last three seasons.  I think Matt Smith as 11 is brilliant.  I love Rory and Amy as characters.  I think the three of them work together wonderfully.  I have liked a majority of the episodes from the Moffat seasons, including a number Moffat himself wrote.  All of which compounds my frustration with this episode.  

I know Moffat can write great television, but, as I think the OP article explains well, for some reason in this episode he got really excited with the plot device of fixed points and angel time loops, and decided that this was the only way to write Amy and Rory out of the show.  I believe he could have done much better, and I believe Amy and Rory deserved better, and I believe the weeping angels were better, scarier and more compelling villains in ""Blink"" where the rules were simple, consistent and clear, instead of mere plot devices they were here.  

I have no idea how that poisons me to an entire run of the show, except to say that from watching pre-showrunner Moffat episodes I know how well he can write episodes of Doctor Who and from watching Sherlock I know how well he can write episodes of television.  I do not think he has consistently matched his potential during his tenure as showrunner, despite having an agile, talented cast with great chemistry.  Doctor Who does not need to be mind-bendingly timey-wimey to be both great TV and great Doctor Who.  Moffat increasingly seems to think it does.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"&gt;As a ex-lib dem voter and party member they've shown themselves to be nincompoops.

/shrug no disagreement from me there. But I'd argue their real issue was failing to adequately prepare themselves for Government, which I guess stems from their lack of recent experience (but then its rather easy to make high-minded promises and spout ideological rhetoric if you never need to deliver on it). Governing (and the responsibility &amp; compromise which comes with it) was always going to be a bit of a reality check for the Lib Dems and their supporters, but in my view also a necessary one for the party to progress.

&gt;As far as markets go, we could of spent more or saved more. Both were valid options, but Labour and Tories had opposing views at the extreme edge. We've tried austerity and it isn't working so it's rather a moot point that what the LD's did was in the interest of the country.

That's the ironic thing; what we call *'austerity'* barely even deserves the name. Put the heated debate to one side and look at the raw figures for Government spending, and we're not actually cutting that much at all. In fact, the decline in GDP of last quarter was prevented from being a heck of a lot worse by the size of Government spending. The room for the Chancellor to manoeuvre is fairly limited; one one side he needs to support growth to bring the country out of recession, but on the other he needs to show some sort of austerity to keep the markets from loosing faith and kicking up our borrowing costs. This is why I argue that the end result wouldn't have changed much, even had labour gotten back in. Its fairly clear that none of the main parties have any bright ideas on how to restore the countries fortunes.

&gt;It's a coalition, and from what I see there's almost no compromise from the Tories whatsoever, some minor things but nothing big.

I'd say there has been a fair bit of compromise, but the Lib Dems main contribution has been to dull the more right wing elements of the Conservative party, forcing the Government further into the centre ground. Getting Lib Dem MP's into ministerial positions was also a victory, as was getting referendums on Electoral reform (although the timing of which was poor and the Lib Dems made a hash of it). I have to ask, given the Lib Dems are only 30% of the Government, what more could you really have asked of them?

&gt;No what we should of done if you want to prove point 3 is to have the Tories as a minority government which would of meant actually working with Labour and LD's to create policy and get it passed in the house. Now LD's are shackled together and they are coming out worse.

I believe that would have been utterly disastrous for the country; there is a place for debate, but there is also a time where decisive action is required. Don't underestimate the importance of showing strength and unity to the worlds markets; two European governments have been brought low by them. Berlusconi survived scandal after scandal, but was ultimately brought down by the markets.

This explanation is rendered moot because we know River delivers the book to Amy to publish, so finding *when* they were transported to is obviously of little or no consequence.

Having said that, the *show's* explanation for why essentially boils down to massively extrapolating what the ""fixed point"" created by Rory reading a gravestone with his name on it, even though he does not identify it as his grave.  The show infers that by reading this gravestone, Rory creates a fixed point which requires him to die and to be buried in that grave, which requires the angel to appear and send him back in time.  Following that logic, Rory can never be ""retrieved"" from that time, because he must die in the past and that gravestone must be his.  Subverting those events would cause a paradox that, as the Doctor says, would destroy New York.  Regardless of the TARDIS, according to this logic, while River could travel to whenever Rory and Amy are (and clearly she does), they cannot leave with her in order to fulfill the fixed point of their tombstone appearing in the future.

If you have a hard time wrapping your head around that, you're not alone, because it is a fairly strained approach to paradoxes, ""fixed points"" and how the angels work, especially as compared to how they were presented originally in ""Blink.""  The ""non-story"" logic is, then, perhaps a bit simpler.  The Weeping Angels are Moffat's most iconic Doctor Who villains and the Ponds are his first companions to exit the show.  Both Karen Gillan and Arthur Darville have said they do not want to have cameos after their characters leave.  Consequently, Moffat came up with a story which allows him to send off his first departing companions using his most notable villains (as compared to ""classic"" who villains like the Daleks, the Master or the Cybermen who were responsible for the departures of the RTD companions) in a way which prevents them from ever being involved in the series again.  

In short, I think it ended up this way because a wizard said so, not because there's a compelling, consistent narrative thread which requires this outcome.  See what happens to Donna Noble for a good example of how a character's exit can be tragic and permanent, while simultaneously also being done in an internally consistent, plot-advancing manner, instead of an ""LOL PYSCHE THEY'RE STILL SCREWED"" tacked on to the end of an already packed 45 minutes of TV.",0,1349094464,null,0,false,0,c6fxzca,t3_10ppbn,t1_c6fxzca,t1_c6fxr6r,null,1430034741,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

And as a piece of social commentary - particularly on the issue of addiction, it's well observed. I know more than a few people who will either openly mock, or claim fruitless, the work done by organisations such as the one I work for, that help people with substance abuse issues. These same people - if you look through their recycling boxes, don't half get through a lot of bottles of wine. And if you ask them about it? The very notion that drinking a bottle of wine, every evening, and a few Saturday night, is somehow indicative of unhealthy behaviour? Why they'll look at you in abject horror at what you're inferring.

In terms of the characters? It's role reversal from the Potter world - here the kids are more interesting, where as I always found the adults waaay more interesting than the central trio, in the HP series.

All of which would be fine, if the actual plot of the book weren't unbelievably tedious. I'll take shitty writing, if it's got a good plot.

Tom, as the grim anger flowed through his now taught body, pulled his slight frame up from the confines of the hand made willow chair he'd bought many years ago as a bargain from a large seedy overweight man at a local car boot fair for, what he thought at the time, to be an unequivocal bargain. Kate always delighted in that chair which made Tom's next action even more poignant. Without a second thought Tom cocked his body in an almost statuesque way, swung his arm through a wide accelerating arc and landed the full weight of his work weary knuckles directly, parallel, with an almost perpendicular wrist to Dave's protruding, unshaven, yet finely chiseled Jaw line.

The sense of justice is diluted by the fact that they are perfectly fine. And 2. It wasn't a stranger. When an innocent stranger is harmed, that can cause the Doctor to get angry instantly, however, it was the Ponds. He first has to mourn their loss before he can become angry. He has to contemplation the full meaning of their loss on his emotions, on his future adventures, on time itself, before he can begin to be angry.

This is where you are wrong, you look at any job which involves social care or caring for someone, be it in elderly nursing homes, community support or nurseries, they're generally all pay minimum wage for a very hard jobs, both physically and mentality. No only that, these jobs are essential for so many peoples life's and should be paid a good wage. These carers have almost zero rights on attempting to get a better deal too, because if you argue and get fired, you are easily replaced because there are so many potential workers available, regardless of their ability on caring for others. It's a total disgrace on Britain! 

This situation gets so retarded that a 22 year old child carer will most likely earn more then a 19 year old supervisor, because the minimum wage kicks in, this example is based on a private nursery, which are a bunch of either employee abusers or/and child abusers.

I see no reason why it could not convert a Dalek into a human, especially if one was originally a human in the first place.

The other idea of a perception filter I think would be great. The doctor having an *actual* Dalek as his companion.

There was a time when a Time Lord only had twelve regenerations (or 13 lives), but it's been established that the Time Lord Council had ways to circumvent that. They once offered The Master a whole new regeneration cycle. I forget if he took them up on the offer. Now that the Time Lords are mostly extinct, The Doctor may not have that limitation any longer. Whatever well of energy is tapped may be more liberal to one Time Lord than it was to many. That may be the same well of energy that the TARDIS taps, which is quite massive. 

Also keep in mind that River was conceived in the TARDIS. The Doctor may be able to manipulate her physical body in ways he can't for anyone else. She may have thought it was his regeneration powers he was ""wasting"" on her, but it could also be an extension of having used the TARDIS for so long.

true,officialdoughboy,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"My interpretation is AOTD he was erased from only the Daleks database.  He had been before and since trying to stay low and erase himself from the universe.  Plus now that Gallifrey is gone, they (Time Lords) are but a myth along with him.  Even though it doesn't seem like it, the Universe may have also been afraid of not just him but the legend of him.  Although I still have it in the back of my head that the Silence is a group created by the Time Lords to get rid of the renegade Doctor.

To get back to the original question:

&gt; Is this just poor planning on the part of the writers? Or am I not understanding this correctly?

Go back to the 9th Doctor's first episode, Rose, when Rose wanted to find out who the Doctor was she got info from the guy who showed her pictures of him throughout time.  The guy understood the Doctor as a myth, even thought the Doctor was a genealogy (the title is passed down from father to son.)

[Spoilers ahead]

Both met the Doctor when they were young, when he saved them from a monster in their bedrooms -- and then, when they thought him just a (possibly imaginary) childhood friend, he returned in early adulthood to sweep them off their feet again and save them once more. He left them both waiting with 'bated breath for his return, but only managed to return to one of them. To me, Reinette is perhaps the more heart-wrenching of the two: She was abandoned much more abruptly, left to await a return which would never happen, and never got to see the stars she so desperately wanted to see. She also knew the Doctor so much more intimately than could anyone else, having seen into his heart and soul directly. Whereas the Pond's final message to the Doctor left me with a feeling of resigned resolution, the Madame's letter left me heartbroken and near tears, wishing against time itself that he could have gone back to give her just one night among the stars.

It has all of my favorite things. Clever writing, good acting, actual mystery and a thriller aspect that isn't trying too hard. 

But what I like most about it is that the characters respond in such a natural and believable manner.

""It is grossly unreasonable to expect schools – as some media commentators sometimes seem to believe – to be responsible for every social ill."" - Nice way of making it seem like she isn't suggesting exactly that, but she follows up with the last two paragraphs detailing exactly why and how the schools should be responsible for another social ill.  

""Most schools go to a lot of trouble to warn children about drugs, smoking – even road accidents. So why not sex gangs?"" - Because sex gangs is a rare problem. Just because an very widely covered incident occured, doesn't mean you need to force schools to waste more of their teaching hours on a subject which won't effect 99.9% of their students. Smoking, road traffic and drugs will be an issue in every pupils life; sex gangs, as bad as they are, won't be.



""Enlightened schools are already doing this..."" - Fucking stupid thing to say; as we criticise many schools for not being able to reach high enough standards against the equally criticised curriculum, lets force all the schools which need all the teaching hours they can get to appease parents, to instead waste time scaring young girls about sex gangs and make the whole thing in to more of an issue than it is. Even if you put it in the allocated time slot for PSHE, the time is far better spent on drugs and road traffic which are overwhelmingly more likely to be issues in a teenagers life . 


""It should be a major topic in PSHE"" - no it shouldn't. Having just come out through the secondary schools system, even when PSHE is actually treated as anything more than the waste of time that it is by teaching staff, the time is far better spent looking at drugs, smoking and road traffic, but also global issues like war, genocide, racism and climate change. The issues looked at should be ones which are likely to effect the pupil's life, not one's which have a very minute chance. You may as well decide that Ebola needs its own space in PSHE because its very nasty. It probably won't effect your child's life, in fact its very unlikely to, but because some stupid parent read the daily mail and convinced herself that it was everywhere, it should be compulsory for kids to learn about it.

They chose Manhattan for its large population.. why would they only be farming a tiny portion of it?

Appears to me the statue of liberty could move across the entire city, because very little of the city was left to look at it. You just don't see it.

Doesn't seem to me it was one isolated building they were farming, rather a much bigger operation. Slowly eating away New York in an alternate timeline that ultimately was entirely collapsed by the Doctor, The paradox also poisons the Angels killing all but a few off. If that hadn't been the case i imagine Earth would have ended up a lot like the planet the Byzanthium landed/crashed into did.

Good job!  If they come back, you can always give monster spray (from concentrate), made from the tears of defeated monsters, and have him spray that in the room. Let him know, ""This acts as a monster repellent.""  You know, build the story up and stuff, make a production, like having a little vial labeled ""monster tears"" and stuff.

Get a tiny bottle of food coloring (or something that he isn't used to seeing, and can't easily identify), put dish soap in there with the food coloring. Say it is ""monster tears"", and show him with some water and pepper (say the pepper are ""monster flakes""/skin cells).  Anyway, put the water in a dish, then put the pepper in there, and it'll float on the top.  When you put a single drop of ""monster tears"" in (the colored soap), the pepper will all shoot to the sides of the container, thus proving that this works to repel monsters.

Remember to say, ""one tiny drop is all you need"". So fill up the bottler with water, let him put the drop in there, and let him spray away.  You won't get stains or suds from the bottle, and he'll have an awesome memory in his childhood.

Best place for Coffee by a big margin is Browns Coffeehouse, they also do some cake and other bits like that. Cafe Boho on the high street is also good if your slightly hungrier although it's normally pretty busy and I guess the slightly faux-vintage theme isn't for everyone. There is also a great french cafe, which does lunch style food and european style coffee which is definitely worth a visit, if not for anything but the manager who is the most french person I've ever met. 

If your talking about a proper sit down fancy meal then I would recommend Deeson's or Cafe Mauresque. These places are both kind of expensive but worth it. Also the Forge near the cinema is great and slightly kinder on the wallet. For good chinese food hit Supernoodle near the Penny Theatre which despite the name and appearance is probably by and far the best place in Canterbury for asian food ( unless you like shitty, watered down ramen in which case go to Wagamama)

As for shopping as a guy I might be much help but if Topshop is your kind of thing there is a place called Roses which stocks the same kind of style, as well as a couple of good vintage boutiques on the King's Mile. As for bookshops there are a couple of smaller, independent ones but the stock they keep is usually pretty poor. I would advise going to either of the two Waterstones if your after something specific. 

If your after anything specific drop me a PM and I can probably help you out :)

At best it could be called a variation, but really he never quotes the original melody from Doomsday in the piece (unless they release an extended actual piece later) so a variation is not really right either.  Inspired by would be a better term.

I just think it's awesome how he weaves the score together to invoke memories.  At first I thought they were going to die when they jumped because of the music, or at least that was the end of them, the underlying bass that he used before, use of a drum set.  There was writing misdirection (What the hell are you doing!) and musical misdirection.  That's what gave it away for me they were okay, the music started lifting up and was filling with wonderment and awe.

I haven't pulled out all the hints from past music in the last sequences of the show, but I know there are more.

As for Rose's theme he didn't use it note for note all the way, but part of it.  I think he did because essentially Moffat used an ending for Amy, writing style, similar to Rose's.  Both spoke off camera about their death, so I imagine he used Rose's Theme again to represent that sequence.  It evoked memories of earlier series with Rose at least for me.

For me the genius of Murray is he great at creating themes for each character and even themes for each regenerated Doctor.  Then does a great job at pulling parts of those themes and melding them together with his newer pieces when he needs to.

true,Ky1arStern,null,null,"The doctor universe 9 times out of 10 makes use of what i think is called the ""ontological paradox"" which is, simplistically, that things always happen because they've always happened. 
This is best explained in that little mini-episode where the TARDIS materializes in the TARDIS. The doctor knows it's the wibbly lever because he was told by himself that it was the wibbly lever because he was told by himself etc. 

moreover the general rule (ok, more like a guidline really) is that the doctor can't cross his own timeline. So he can pretty much run around throughout time and erase records of himself as he wants, so long as he doesn't do it in a time and place where he was already doing something. We generally view this world through the doctors eyes so we're exempt from the non-linearity that the people around him generally see. 

If you really want to stop and think about it, daleks prior to AOTD would know who he is, thats how they knew to grab him. Furthermore they're capable of moving throughout time (i think) so that adds another layer of complexity to this.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"Aha! I'm on time, this week.

So, I'm feeling positive for a change. Which can only be a bad thing. Leeds have had an absolutely outstanding week and even managed to avoid having a hangover after a great win over Everton. This puts us on the cusp of being on a roll. Bolton have been suffering from indifferent form so far this season, and they're by far the biggest underachievers of the relegated Premiership trio, at this stage of the season. This bodes well for Leeds, although it's worth bearing in mind that they lost to Palace at home on Saturday - and most teams won't roll over and lose two on the bounce at home. They'll be fired up to play well, no doubt, just like we were against Forest. The old Tuesday night league curse might also flare up again.

As I consider this, the argument for a draw seems to be increasingly convincing. In truth, I would actually take a draw from this game, especially if we can take all three points against Barnsley later this week. However, I'm growing tired of being cynical and pessimistic, so I'm going for **2-1 Leeds**. (I still don't expect us to defend particularly well, but it seems that most Championship teams can't this season.)

Here's my predicted line-up and bench, for what it's worth:

---------------Kenny

Byram---Lees---Pearce---Peltier

White---Brown---Austin---Tonge

---------------Diouf

---------------Becchio

Subs: Ashdown, Drury, Pugh, Norris, Varney, Poleon, Gray.

I'm actually not entirely sure whether we've been operating a 4-4-1-1 or a 4-3-3 formation, but due to the way Sam and Aidy have been linking up, I'm guessing it's the former (a bit of a throwback to the days of Prutton or Delph on the wing, with Tonge drifting in from a wide position, really).

Personally, I would drop Peltier and bring Drury in, because Byram is undroppable right now and our midfield has started to play good football, but I'm not entirely convinced by Peltier - especially at left-back, because it nullifies him going forward, since he always has to cut inside of his right boot. That said, I know that Warnock simply won't drop his captain. I would also be surprised if he dropped Brown, after his stellar performance against Everton and his solid display against Bristol.",0,1349118609,null,0,false,0,c6g3gqe,t3_10rt78,t1_c6g3gqe,t3_10rt78,null,1430037394,3,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,3

true,NonSequiturEdit,hartnell,Hartnell,"It's not wrong, though:

1. Nowhere was it said that they were sent back to 1938.  All we know from the headstone is that they died when they were eighty-something.  Given that they were both probably in their early thirties in subjective age when they were sent back, that gives them fifty years to live out their lives.  This obituary puts them in New York in 1963, which is a little late, but they could easily have spent a decade or more before that just tooling around and getting their bearings.  
  
2. As for Melody, in ""Day of the Moon"" we saw her regenerate in New York City, 1970.  Presumably, she regenerated into Mels, but that leaves a twenty year gap between then and her ""growing up"" with Rory and Amelia in Leadworth.  So either she didn't physically age in all that time or she regenerated again before going to Leadworth.  At any rate, the scenario in this obituary is entirely plausible, even likely, although I would push the dates back even farther.  
  
I like to think that Amy and Rory got to raise her for a time as proper parents, and that after they passed away she got into trouble and lived on her own for a while (maybe Kovarian caught up with her again) before becoming ""Mels"" and moving to Leadworth to be with them again.  It's even possible that she learned more about the Doctor and came to blame him for her messed up situation, fueling her programmed need to kill him.

She does not say she was aware at the time at all of anything she could have acted upon. She's talking about solid allegations that came to her attention after he died and unsubstantiated rumours that were floating around when he was alive. Remember she worked in a different department, she did not work with Savile or socialise with him, all she knew of him was second hand. You can't go to the police with second hand hearsay, it's not admissible evidence, this documentary is only possible because one woman finally did go to the police to make an allegation in 1997 - a fact which only become known to people not directly involved just before Christmas last year. 

Savile (if he's guilty) was obviously a manipulator, I'm sure some people close to him were helping him cover his tracks, but to conflate hearing a second hand rumour about someone with knowing they committed a crime is unjust in the extreme. By that token you'd convict everyone who read sickipedia whilst Savile was still alive. 

I'm quite aware of how these rumours work in favour of an abuser, in my school there were paedo rumours about 3 male teachers.... one of them turned out to be an active paedo (at a scout group, evidence found on hard drive at computer repair shop so he was convicted) but the fact that every weird teacher attracts paedo rumours protected him for years, because the other teachers felt compelled to give him the benefit of the doubt and because they had no more evidence against him than they did against the other teachers who *were* innocent.

true,funions_mcgee,null,null,"I feel like this is probably more true than all the paradox stuff... not that that couldn't apply, but the thing is that if either River or the Doctor were put in a situation where they really needed to get the Ponds back, it wouldn't have to be true (ie: the season 6 finale, which was all sorts of fucked up but they managed to get on the right side of everything). 

I feel like especially, if the Doctor wasn't seeing it like this, River certainly was. She drops hints like ""Never let him see you age"", and breaking her wrist as opposed to using any other kind of solution. She at least knows they will be safe &amp; together in this solution. I'm sure much more desperate measures would have been afforded if the natural length of the lives or existences of either of the ponds were at stake.

Although Moffat doesn't take the time to spell it out for us like RTD did, I think the same kind of issues at Rose's end are at play. If the writer's needed Rory and Amy back, it would be complicated and difficult, but possible.If it wasn't the Doctor forcing the issue, it was River(she eggs on Amy with a ""yes, it is!""). 


Because ""He knows they died, so they can't possibly see each other"" simply doesn't work in cannon; How else could the Doctor meet characters like Winston Churchill or Queen Nefertiti? 

Death in DW is very circumstantial. Even if we argue that companions/time travelers have different rules than people who exist in a ""natural""/regular time stream, both River &amp; the face of Boh break those rules. (If most characters, like the Brigadier or the girl in the fireplace don't).. If the writer's were intent on sorting things out explicitly quite yet, they would have. OR it might be because both River &amp; the face of Boh (spoilers for RTD era) have their own methods of time travel beyond the Tardis. The logic gets very complicated and is honestly usually based on what fits the story best, with some loose rules. 

I feel like a better gauge of why/what happens should be placed on intent of character or intent of writer (vis a vis character). Esp. Moffat era.

He's never seeing her or Rory again, their timeline from there on is closed off to him.

Now, my math might be off, but, depending on birth years, Elderly Ponds could have met up with Little Boy Brian.  And I don't mean in a time-traveling way -- just them deciding to take a vacation in Europe when they're old, and meeting little Brian at however years young he was then. Rory would know where his dad grew up as a child, it'd be easy to do.  And, since Brian doesn't *get* to see his son grow old, there's less chances of being recognized.  It's not like Brian's gonna see Rory slowly grow old and looking *exactly* like that old man he met as a kid.

Heck, for all we know, Rory could have been named after ""that nice old man"" -- himself.  It would be *""You named your daughter... after your OWN daughter""* all over again.  Officially making The Ponds the most timey-wimey family EVER.

It's a huge stretch, but it's the only way I can come up with for Rory to get some closure and see his dad again... though, sadly, this doesn't help *Brian*.  :(

Time isn't fixed. You can die before you're born(or apparently, die while you're still alive elsewhere). The Doctor doesn't have to have a consistent history, he can meddle with the rest of the universe without his own history being changed because he's a Time Lord. It's what he does. Time travelers that come with him have their personal histories protected by Time Lord technologies in the Tardis.

River is also a Time Lord(sort of ish), and her timeline is connected to the Doctor's.

It's not the neatest theory, but it makes the most sense with the constant shifting of time in this show. It would make sense for the Doctor to realize that he made a mistake and became ""too big"", so he decided to erase himself back out of history(remember, the 9th and 10th Doctors were pretty adamant about remaining unknown to the universe at large, so that history itself had to change for the Battle of Demon's Run to happen in the first place!).

edit: This theory is way more about the plan for there being Angels in NYC rather than the fate of Amy and Rory. But maybe that's what Matt was talking about? This is further supported by Moffat saying that he needed Karen and Arthur to tell him that they were leaving way beforehand, so he could figure out what happens to them. If he had always known their fate, he should have just been able to plug this into a formula and it would have all worked out.

You want to fly to Paris - you can choose your airline. (Adjusting for inflation) 50 years ago, would an airline fly you for £10 or whatever like Ryanair? You have multiple options and can make decisions based on price, comfort, schedules, reputation etc.

You can also include Broadband, Mobile tariffs, Utilities, Parcel Delivery basically any modern day service offering. So why should any other service be any different, if there is genuine competition and proper regulation? Clearly the model has been proven to work in other sectors in the UK.

You've listed the same 2011 report three times and the other one from the Daily Mail article says its efficient, but poor for providing long healthy lives. Brilliant!!! Effectively saying you'll die early, but we'll do it efficiently. This hardly makes a compelling case to suggest we have a perfect health service and not commented on the articles suggesting its not efficient...

Is it efficient - unclear it would seem. I'm guessing you aren't saying its perfect, in which case it can be made improved. So we have kind of gone full circle as this comes back to my original point of it being too blinkered to simplify it to the level of private sector bad, public sector good.

true,NonSequiturEdit,hartnell,Hartnell,"There is this, yes.  Trying to untie the knots the Doctor has tied throughout the space-time continuum is not for mere mortals.  
  
Still, this is all relative to *the Doctor's personal timeline*.  He is erasing traces of himself in all times, yes, but he cannot erase that which lies in his *own* history.  All he can do is try to ensure that *in his own future*, people don't know who he is.  
  
This in no way undoes the fact that at the time he was supposed to be killed at Lake Silencio, there *was* record of him, and that record said definitively that he died there.  The Silence observed the event and made certain that that information was spread and made universal *canon* - ie, a fixed point.  The Doctor merely realized that the event they witnessed and recorded need not be him *actually* dying, but a cleverly-conceived fake.  But all the records said he *died*, so avoiding a universe-shattering paradox required him to maintain that illusion as long as possible.  To make that easier, he started erasing records of himself.

true,istara,australia,Australia,"Analysing why someone is a ""good"" writer is interesting because it means so many things to different people, and different audiences.

I tend to analyse it more in terms of ""success"": *why is author x so popular among audience y?*

That's more useful, because then you can decide if you want your own writing to reach out to a particular target market.  You're never going to satisfy the mass Fifty Shades crowd *and* the Booker Prize Council (or it's highly unlikely that you will). It's actually possible to write a really superb, beautiful, ""light romance"" novel, but no one from the high brow end of town is going to give it the same weight of regard as they would a more consciously intellectually targeted work.

It has to be acknowledged that there is a level of snobbery that will find certain readers actively disliking certain popular books, solely because they appeal to a mass audience.  So it depends whether you want your work appreciated by a high literary echelon, or to get onto bestsellers lists and sell a tonne.

And obviously there is a midmarket in between, which I think J K Rowling is aiming for, which is perhaps why she seems to have divided critics with this latest novel.

 - she picked a good theme (children like magic, they are familiar with the school setting, so it's both safe and exotic) 
 - the lack of originality contributed to nostalgia value for adult readers (I was reminded of Enid Blyton's Malory Towers, which took me back to my childhood)
 - her books were highly imaginative (the early ones particularly), the detail is very good.  Eg Harry's school uniform/equipment list
 - her lack of ""high brow"" writing makes her book more accessible for younger and less proficient readers
 - she understands children, and/or remembers her own school days well
 - she planned a series, so each book is not really complete, you want the next one
 - she was marketed very well

I totally agree, although 10's fast-talking definitely got him into some interesting out-loud internal monologues. Sometimes he would get going and you could basically hear him thinking and it worked really well. 11 has tried to pull it off with less success, but it does still work in some scenes. My favorite of these from 11 was this from Night Terrors immediately after getting put into the doll's house:

true,IntellegentIdiot,null,null,"Thank you so much for posting this, I haven't seen anyone else who seems to be bothered by what happened. As someone who grew up in the 80's, and yes was a telly addict, what happened in 1990 was a total disaster. I can't really come up with a decent analogy but imagine if someone had burnt all the copies of the Star Wars trilogy in existence in 1990. We'd still have the prequels so it was almost be the same except it would be much much worse because there was some pale imitation where art once was. If you mentioned Star Wars, people would think of Natalie Portman and Jar Jar not Carrie Fisher and Chewie. It might be okay but the fact that it's related to the greatest film ever makes it a cruel joke.

ITV in the 80's was pretty amazing at times. Thames TV was a benchmark for quality TV. They gave us The Bill, they gave us Minder and so much more. Then they ""lost"" the franchise and overnight ITV turned to shit. At the time I was optimistic, they're new, I thought, things will improve once things settle down. They even kept some of the old shows around and Thames was still making TV right? Even though they didn't own the franchise that was the main thing, right? Well no, it just wasn't the same. Maybe other things were at work but it didn't feel the same, The Bill was now ""The Bill"", it looked the same but it didn't feel the same, it was a cheap imitation. 

Even LWT, who kept their franchise, felt different. 80's TV felt like a low budget film, rough around the edges but edgy. 90's TV felt like a soulless blockbuster, all shiny but with no heart.

I was so pissed, I couldn't understand why they would take something that was so good and just screw it up for the sake of it. My ray of hope was that the whole mess would be rectified when the franchises came up for renewal, which I was lead to believe was 10 years after the start. Now 10, years is a lifetime when you're not even a teenager but at least there's light at the end of the tunnel. I don't remember what happened exactly but somehow they moved the goalposts and gave them another 10 years or something equally unfair

I wanted to like Carlton, I really did but it was in vain. I tried and tried but everything was just so poor. I gave up on ITV a long time ago, having been let down so many times. Sadly the BBC has gone downhill too. I almost missed the fantastic Outnumbered because of so many poor BBC sitcoms, after OFITG, OFAH, Blackadder and I'm Alan Partidge finished.",0,1349138854,null,0,false,0,c6g8tv7,t3_10pfqv,t1_c6g8tv7,t1_c6fisl4,null,1430039992,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

But in both the absolutely cavalier attitude towards safety you saw in workplaces and accounts of completely avoidable deaths and serious injuries and terrible working conditions particularly for immigrant labour was astonishing.

I remember going to building sites and stuff with my dad as a kid, the very idea of a 10 year old boy helping his dad on sites where no one had any safety equipment, and when they did they never used it. Something that was insane by today's standards.

Moffat is an amazing writer/director. He has proved this on Sherlock, on Coupling, and on Doctor Who. But this last episode felt...forced. There were some genuinely amazing moments. The girl playing peekaboo with the angel is one. But they got lost in the frenzy of lets go back in time and oh no wait lets do this but if we do this things will blow up and oh one more thing. 

This episode could have been so much more. If the Angels had kept to their self consistent rules they had in Blink. If the storyline was a bit tighter. If there weren't as many plotholes. But most of all, the sacrifice at the end of the episode felt too predictable, and it felt empty. I didn't get any sort of emotions when Rory and Amy went back because what happened wasn't tragic.

If Engels was right and Marx did discover the law of development of human history the answer to your question will vary depending on the current social &amp; economic circumstances the journalist can 'profit' from. So the question if journalists do a terrible job is irrelevant, since financial results is all that count. If Engels was wrong I do not know the answer, I will however suggest that the most down-voted comment ITT will lean more towards the truth due to nature of political discourse you find on reddit.

I only ever tune into subs after catching up entirely with a series, and even then, I'm selective.  Doctor Who I avidly try to avoid spoilers for, though the departure of Amy/Rory, and Clara being introduced, was too widespread to avoid.

*The Walking Dead* is one where I don't mind spoiler bits, though I read the comics, so I kind of find it exciting to see where the show deviates.

It can sometimes be difficult to remain part of a community like this, while also maintaining avoidance of spoilers.  I think part of the problem stems from what to be discussed in between episodes/seasons.  Sometimes the only news is cast  changes and such, or sometimes so much has already been discussed, that the new news is all that's ""new.""  It's unfortunate.  The spoiler markers could help, but even thread titles can give away things (as reinforced by TATM, incidentally).  I wish there was a good solution to that!

&gt; Back in the late 90s, the only way you could watch the Premier League in the States was on pay per view cable stations. I lived in Boston and had a black box(how everyone in the city ""cheated"" cable) on my cable, so every Saturday or Sunday morning I caught the early game or a replay from the day before (surprisingly one channel over from the Spice Channel, classy!). That's how I first got exposed to European football outside of the World Cup.

&gt;Fast forward a few years and every game I started regularly see was Arsenal this and Arsenal that. In the 2003-2004 season that featured ""The Invincibles"", I started to realize the scorn I had for them that built up over the years, and the irrationality of its nature, similar to the irrational hatred I always had for the Yankees (for obvious reasons, being a life-long Bostonian).

&gt;On April 25th, Arsenal clinched the league at White Hart Lane; it was the first time I really noticed the atmosphere at the Lane on my crappy TV. Spurs barely got broadcast at all; every game I saw over the 4-5 years I started watching as a neutral had Arsenal or United involved 90% of the time.

&gt;Watching the supporters at the Lane was awesome. Playing their biggest rivals, the atmosphere was intense, especially with the stakes that were on the line. They were louder than any of the numerous home Arsenal games cable shoved down my throat. Why wouldn't I be drawn to the biggest rival of the team I've grown to loathe? The rivalry even had the underdoggish/lopsided nature that I'd grown up with my whole life supporting the Red Sox.

&gt;Later that fall, I was gearing up for the greatest week in Red Sox history. I was even heading to Fenway for Game 1 of the World Series that night to watch it in person. Instead of all the fanfare and pre-game stuff to do that morning, I was glued to stolen pay per view, watching Spurs host Bolton.

&gt;That's how Spurs chose me.",0,1349152090,null,0,false,0,c6gbl9h,t3_10sagj,t1_c6gbl9h,t3_10sagj,null,1430041294,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

I see it a different way.

The Doctor has been running from this past since the 9th incarnation and the end of the Time War. One of things he has is a strong ethical code he uses to He is battling his inner demons and his guilt over the War and all the things he did to end it. Numerous comments have been made about him running from his past. At some point, he will have to face his choices and that will lead to the Fall of the Eleventh.

The Battle of Trenzalore will be a culmination of events were the Doctor has become what he fears the most, a monster and like the Time Lords that were willing to destroy the universe to defeat the Daleks. The Silence will do everything in their powers to prevent the Doctor from getting to the fields of Trenzalore that they will create the monster they sought to stop. We'll find out the Silence is a vast wide ranging group that includes some people of the Doctor's most beloved, humans, and possbily some he's come to know and trust.

The rage that was bubbling under the 9-11th incarnations will bubble forth and he will smite down all those have sought to destroy him. Yes, the Doctor will become the bad guy. A terrible event will happen where the Doctor has to answer to himself. The question isn't just ""Doctor Who?"" but a longer version ""Doctor who are you?"". He will have no choice but to answer it and answer it honestly. Of course, he'll come to terms with all this guilt, rage and sorrow that he's been running away from for at least 300 years.

If you're not going to feature much of the Doctor and/or his companions, you really ought to be good in every other way (surprisingly, that's a pattern that's upheld rather well - The Girl Who Waited, Midnight, Turn Left, The Lodger)...

Instead I felt like there wasn't anything really unique, original, usefully clever. It was crafted okay based on its premise, but I don't feel like it took it anywhere or did anything.

The entire thing is somewhat like a Schrodinger's cat scenario, but the result varies depending on who sees it.  The Doctor is rewriting time in a small way by erasing himself from records. It becomes more of a problem with the library, as his defeat of the Vashta Nerada was contingent on his existence in the records of the library.

I read something once about not having the budget for film to do takes, so they'd just recover and keep going. Somehow having the Doctor stumble on his words every now and then makes him seem more real and relatable than the fast-talking 10th and 11th Doctors.

I agree times a million. It's one of the reasons why I love early Woody Allen movies like Annie Hall. He often has the actors go straight through runs, and doesn't stop if somebody stumbles over a line, or forgets what they're supposed to say. If done right, and the actors pull it off right, it comes off as a more natural conversation. Sometimes if conversations are *too* perfect in movies/TV shows, it can really pull me out as I am suddenly consciously aware that the conversation is 100% staged.",0,1349155011,null,0,false,0,c6gc8bm,t3_10sbi2,t1_c6gc8bm,t3_10sbi2,null,1430041595,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

I really disliked Midnight. I agree with the above comments about the copycat talking being hugely annoying and a distraction from the point of the episode. I really disliked Donna as a companion, and it was disappointing that the one episode from the season that wasn't filled with Donna blabbering was filled with copycat blabbering instead.

The End of Time would be my favorite thing in the series, though I guess it's technically a special, not an episode. If I can't pick a special(and I'll disinclude season finales because they're always the best of any season, imo), I'd have to pick Dalek or Vincent and the Doctor. I really liked The Shakespeare Code, Tooth and Claw, The God Complex and The Family of Blood, too. After that there are a ton of episodes I like a lot, including Blink, but that don't stand out particularly when I think about episodes I loved, then there are some standardish episodes, then there are the bad ones that I try not to remember(Midnight, Partners in Crime, 42, all the Slitheen ones, and the first two episodes of the first season).

Sorry, you asked a question with a very complicated answer. It's hard to say why I like some episodes more than others. Thinking back, the Family of Blood wasn't exactly the best, but I get incredible chills at the end when the son is recounting what the Doctor did to them, and says, ""He never raised his voice. That was the worst thing — the fury of the Time Lord. And then we discovered why — why this Doctor, who had fought with gods and demons, why he had run away from us and hidden... *he was being kind.*"" It was one of those moments in the series that *defined* the Doctor for me.

I get that it shows that scene in the first episode just like it did in this last one, but that is not what I thought was going on.

For a minute there I thought that when the doctor came back, that he was from this episode. As in, when we watched that first episode, we were tricked. That he was first still the brand new doctor, but that when he came back, he was actually coming from this new episode! But as I said, there is nothing to indicate that.

The part where I said it pans away while on her chest was just something that I stuck in there as I had just watched that part to check the doctor and the Tardis out and didn't remember the ending (good catch. I didn't remember it because it looked like she was dreaming.) it wasn't what I was actually talking about, although I did believe there was a difference in the timeline before you pointed out the ending. 

So I guess it's correct to assume that she has more information about the doctor, and formed a stronger connection to him because he actually did come back during this time period.

It finally hit me, and I felt like an idiot for not realizing it sooner, that they answered that question in that very scene. Rory got zapped back to New York in 1939, then lived there until he died of old age. That's why there was a gravestone in that graveyard with his name on it. It doesn't matter if the Doctor can visit him or not. He could park the TARDIS right on Rory's doorstep, for all it matters. But Rory can't go with him. They've already made one paradox, and as the Doctor said, if they tried to make another one, it would rip New York apart. Then Amy got sent back too, so now he can't save either one of them because both of their names were on the gravestone.

If they hadn't already seen the gravestone before Rory got sent back, they might still have a chance of saving him. But they saw his grave, and once they saw it, it became inevitable. Once you know the future, it can't be changed without creating a paradox. It wasn't a matter of the Doctor not being able to land the TARDIS in that time period; River confirms later that she can still use the vortex manipulator and go there, because she has to deliver her book to Amy. That's not the issue. The issue is that, even if he went back for them, he wouldn't be able to take them out of that time frame, and even if he did, he would still have to take them back at the end of their adventures, instead of taking them home.

true,Frankeh,eng-eastsusex,South East,"&gt;They are correct actually. It probably cant work globally but it can at a country level.

How did you come to that conclusion? It's literally never worked before. 

I'll take sainsburys as an example. 

They make a net profit of £640m and have 150,000 employees. Lets assume that they're all adult minimum wage for this example. 

Current minimum wage is £6.19. Assuming a 40 hour week that's £12875.20 a year per employee. 

They pay out to their employees approximately £1.931bn

If we change the minimum wage to £19 then that number goes up to £5.927bn

That's a smidgen off £4bn more that they'd have to make up elsewhere. Remember, their profit is £640m so as you can see that's destroyed their profit and put them well into the red. 

To fix this they'd need to increase the prices of the food in their supermarkets, now assuming they'd want to keep the same profit of £640m (They wouldn't due to inflation. They'd want to increase it) then they'd have to charge and extra £4bn to customers for their food. 

They'd have to increase the profit margin on their food by about 600% to stay in the black. 

According to [this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18951422) retailers make 34p per pint of milk. They'd need to increase that profit margin by about 6 times to £2 odd to help cover the higher wages. 

This would cause milk to go from £1.18 to £2.84. 

This doesn't take into account the fact that the producers of the milk will also need to cover their workers minimum wage increase, so will the shippers, etc. You'd easily see a £3.50 4 pints of milk. Just under 300% increase in milk cost to match a just over 300% increase in wages. 

In your world sainsburys would fail, 150,000 people would be without jobs and then you'd expect the country to prosper. Under such conditions you would see no prosperity, just hyperinflation and poverty. Everyones savings would be wiped out in the blink of an eye too.

Both times I had to give out baskets to customers at the entrance, so i'm guessing that this is a standard interview exercise that they do (The Boots stores were different both locations, 30 miles apart), just make sure that you offer everyone a basket, although as it's central London at around lunch time they might not make you do this, but be prepared for it anyway. Smile a shit load, they love it.  They also showed me a shelf, and asked me what I would do with it if I had 10 minutes. I just said that I would tidy the shelf, maybe go and get some more stock if needs be, move all the stuff to the front and make sure that it's organised correctly. 

I'm not sure about giving your thought on a product, but i'd say as you will probably be quite nervous, it's a good idea to go with something that you're comfortable with and could talk about easily. Also, i'd advise walking through the store for 10-15 minutes before your interview to familiarise yourself with the store as they are most likely to be doing some of the interview on the shop floor. 

I've had quite a few job interviews for a 20 year old and was in the same position as you until recently, retail is a good place to work if you are in the right place, it's just the customers but you just get used to it eventually. Just make sure that you maintain eye contact (don't look deeply into their eyes..just don't look at your shoes the whole time), be confident, friendly, just try and sound like you're happy to be there. Also shaking an interviewers hand when you first meet them and before you leave is always a good idea, and always turn up around 10 minutes early. Also, dress nicely, but that goes without saying.

I've read far too much from academics whose names I simply can't even remember. I have also read, and enjoyed works by Marx. I don't speak German unfortunately so I have to deal with dodgy translations. 

After 4 years of poli-sci (including an MA) I still view Marx with respect for his initial writings. It's the crap that his pseudo-followers and academics came up with afterwards that bug me.  We used to have to read articles/books filled with absolute nonsense. Words, sentences, pages and chapters filled with, useless, page filling, hating crap. Pure revulsion and derision for anyone who may dare to suggest that Marx perhaps, had it wrong and that (especially modern) capitalism is not, actually, that bad in terms of human history.

I'm not saying that the forces of right wing academia are much better, but I fail to see how teaching Marx in any university course is relevant when all lecturers do is push the bollocks  and forget that Marx offered a critique, not a solution.

So if the interest free period is 1 year at zero if you can afford to pay back in that time or 2 or more years at zero for 1st year and then 33% for future  years then you are clearly offering different payment plans for repayment periods.

However, as for the kidnapping, I got this from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping#England_and_Wales):

&gt;Kidnapping of children
In all cases where it is alleged that a child has been kidnapped, it is the absence of the consent of that child which is material. This is case regardless of the age of the child. A young child will not have the understanding or intelligence to consent.

&gt;This means that absence of consent will be a necessary inference from the age of the child. It is a question of fact for the jury whether an older child has sufficient understanding and intelligence to consent.[5] Lord Brandon said:

&gt;I should not expect a jury to find at all frequently that a child under fourteen had sufficient understanding and intelligence to give its consent.[6]


&gt;If the child (being capable of doing so) did consent to being taken or carried away, the fact that the person having custody or care and control of that child did not consent to that child being taken or carried away is immaterial. If, on the other hand, the child did not consent, the consent of the person having custody or care and control of the child may support a defence of lawful excuse.[5]

Okay, let's do it another way. Annual profit for Sainsburys, as you stated in your original example, was £640m. Let's take half of that - £320m - and distribute it amongst those 100k floor staff. That works out at an extra £3200 per annum, or assuming a 40 hour week - or an extra £1.52 per employee, per hour.

And unfortunately those latch key kids grow up to be teenagers who wander about the estate causing trouble because they have grown up unsupervised and unguided. Yes we all played out on the street as kids, yes the risk of any child being abducted outside their house is extremely low, but times have changed and if mollycoddling and overprotection is what it takes these days to ensure children grow up safe, and into mature responsible adults, then I am all for it.

That's his strength. That's what's he's gained from ""living"" those 2000 years. He will do anything to protect what he love most. It doesn't have to be some kickass battle skill. Just because he could go into ""warrior mode"" doesn't mean he has to because that is not the most important thing that he took away from his experience. Its very arguable that he wouldn't have been able to help in Demon's Run if he didn't have his alternate past. He isn't completely helpless and has learned a lot from being with the Doctor, just like Amy.

That is what Rory gained as a character from that arc.

Deesons will change your mind about British cuisine. It's great (both the restaurant and the British cuisine).

I enjoyed the food at Cafe du Soleil, aswell. It's Mediterranean inspired British food - if that makes any sense? It's a nice setting aswell.

true,Apathetic_Superhero,uk,United Kingdom,"I worked there for about 4 years.  Pick any product, preferably one you can talk about.  They don't care which product, they want to see how well you communicate and how you deal with the customer.  I promise you this has absolutely nothing to do with the product.  You need to focus on delivering the information across.  

I would not go with perfume, it is a product that people will either like and not like, it is hard to advise which one over any other as it is personal preference. I would go with shampoo as you can have ones for coloured hair, frizzy hair, dry hair, dandruff etc etc.  The important thing is to find out what the customer wants and advise on that.  Do they have greasy hair?  Pick a shampoo that works well with it.  If you aren't comfortable with hair products go for deodorant.  Do they play sports?  Are they worried about high aluminium count?  Do they want 48 hour protection?  White stain protection?  

When you pick an area that you want to talk about, be reasonably familiar with the products.  Don't pick shampoo and go and look at them for the first time with the interviewee.  Go the day before, have a casual look over the different brands and different qualities they offer so you can make an informed decision to help them.  Have a quick look at the special offers (buy 2 for 3).  Try and offer these as they make the customer spend more than they hoped for but at the same time give them good value for money.  Don't tell them they are spending more money, tell them they are saving money by stocking up.

At the end of the day, it is trying to help the customer pick a product and finding their needs.

When you do the shop walkaround focus on empty shelves that need to be filled, products in the wrong place, gaps where items can be pulled to the front of the shelf, clearing empty packets etc.  


Be yourself, try and be helpful, be clear and communicative and smile.  These are valuable bits that will be noted.

Good luck!

Edit:  I am male and I never once saw there being a problem.  A lot of the male candidates would be too quiet, showed little communication and not a lot of enthusiasm.

true,hazelwoof,uk,United Kingdom,"Can't believe I haven't seen anyone say this yet but its the best retail interview tip I ever got. 

Before your interview (so today, tomorrow or whatever) go into both the branch you're being interviewed for and a different Boots branch and go and talk to the staff on the shop floor in there. They've all been through it and everyone loves to talk about themselves. 
Try and choose a time when it's less busy, pop in dressed fairly smartly and just have a chat. Ask leading questions like, what is it like to work here? What's your favourite thing about working here? Least favourite thing? Things along those lines. Chances are the staff member will be flattered that you've asked them and maybe you've just set yourself up for a friendship when you start working there. Best case scenario: You talk to one of the interviewers who remembers you and how keen you were. Worst case scenario: They tell you they are busy and go away. (That's why I recommend a quiet time) This also gives you a chance to suss out where things are for the shop exercises task. 

I have worked in retail a while now and this is the advice I give to everyone coming in to my store at the moment, brandishing a CV. 

You can and should do a trial run for how long it takes to get to the store; there is nothing worse in an interview than being late. This could be combined into my above suggestion. Give yourself an extra hour to get there anyway. Maybe the tube has delays or something and if you get there really early you can always go and get a drink in Costa beforehand. 

Other key things others have picked up on: Who are the competitors? Do some quick research, find it out. What sets Boots apart from those competitors? What is excellent customer service? Retail companies love to pretend they are all about customer service so this is likely to be very important to them. 

They will ask if you have any questions. This dangerous territory. Don't ask something that they may have already answered in the interview, something that is easily found on the website, something that is just plain common sense or something that makes you sound as if you are only interested in yourself e.g. how much holiday do I get? 
Do ask an intelligent, positive thought out question, perhaps one that gets the interviewer to talk about themselves (this is a theme, people love to talk about themselves and it makes you appear more interesting and likeable). Quickly developing a rapport with the interviewer is important; this is something you will have to countless times a day with customers in retail and is something they will be looking out for. 

On the topic of ""Why do you want to work for Boots?"" make a brainstorm of the question and come up with 3 - 4 points you can make. This is one of the hardest to make up on the spot and will require some though. It was also almost certainly come up. Try and be genuine. It's a hard question and if you want more suggestions don't hesitate to ask. 

Good luck with the interview, hope all goes well. Send me a message or something or post in here if you want some more advice.

9. New College (despite the name, this place is OLD, and it feels a bit like a castle inside).

Be warned! Pretty much every college has some manky concrete accommodation built in the 60s/70s which they don't show on the prospectus! And you'll be living out of college for at least one year of undergrad (and as a medic, most of your degree, I imagine), so that relegates college to little more than a social hub and a source of cheap dinners.

The exception to this is Catz (whoo!), where you can live in all three years, and maybe Keble and Somerville these days (I was there three years ago so things might have changed).

As a warning, a couple I wouldn't pick:

1. St Anne's (U.G.L.Y.)
2. St Hugh's (nothing against it except it's miles out of town. You'll be on your bike a lot if you study here)
3. LMH (Far away and a bit boring)
4. Christ Church (with respect to armedrobbery, it's oversubscribed and it looks better from the outside than the inside)

But really, this is just me. They're all incredible places to be and Oxford is a great town. As a warning, you'll be interviewed at your first choice college (and also at a random second college), but you might get placed somewhere completely different. This is especially true if you apply to one of the more famous colleges (Christ Church, Magdalene, Merton etc). 

If it helps, as a medic you'll be spending a lot of time in the John Radcliffe, which is in East Oxford, so you might want to pick over that side of town. 

Sorry for the essay! Hope that gives you a bit more info.  Ask me anything you like if you've got more questions. My info is three years out of date, but in Oxford time pretty much stands still! Good luck on your applications!

Remember when the Master ""died"" on this floating aircraft carrier? 10th begging him to just regenerate? well he kinda did in a way, but it was a true regeneration.  something happened, something warped his regeneration turning him into an even more psychotic person.  He was hungry yes but he was even more crazy/evil even for the Master.  I think this will come in to play.

11th gave up a wee little bit of his regeneration to heal River.  sort of careless really as her wound would have healed anyways over time.  Now we're not too sure how MUCH regeneration was used to mend her but it was enough to cause River great concern.  We know t he Valeyard shows up between the Doctors 12th and final versions.  WHAT IF something goes wrong with his next regeneration.  He's a bit angry now and he doesn't quite have all the regeneration juice to make a full one (so we're meant to believe) what if something gets messed up.  perhaps the regeneration ""splits"" him into two.  causing the Valeyard (or hell even the Watcher) or maybe his 12th IS the Valeyard.  Now I read online somewhere that Matt Smith has agreed to stay on until at least 2014 or 15.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"In truth, i became a Spurs fan because of an Arsenal fan and Jermaine Jenas...

i was visiting a friend in London.  I have always been a fan of football (soccer) but being trapped in the US where (until recently) catching a game, ANY game pretty much involved seeking out an Irish pub filled with refugees of England/Ireland/Scotland all braying on about Manchester United.  While i often did go to watch these matches ManU never appealed to me.

Anyways, i am off to visit a college friend in London. Numerous days of drinking come and go and my buddy keeps telling me about Arsenal and how ""The greatest team ever assembled etc."" regales stories of the ""Invincibles"" goes on and on about how ""much like our women, our style of play is beautiful"" (yeah, he is a bit of an ass) and how once i see them i will fall in love with them.

Sure enough he landed tickets to the match at the Lane and i was to be introduced to my ""new passion"" by watching Arsenal beat the ""spuds"".  Fair enough, he had done a good sales job on me i was about to see this ""new passion"" of mine clearly i would become enamored with Arsenal as Nick Hornby had described in Fever Pitch.

One problem with my friend's plan.....he brought me to the Lane, despite all his sales pitches and assurances that i would become Arsenal through and through my buying into Arsenal was slowly fading as we stepped into the Lane, it was small, cramped, kinda dirt and i felt like i was on top of not only the people in front of me but the field as well.  Then the Spurs fans started singing in full throat it sounded like there was no one else in the stands, just Spurs fans. So much for the reserved English demeanor this place was fucking loud .

Game kicks off and Robbie Keane notches one for Spurs and then Spurs just seem to get buried by the Gunners, chance after chance for Arsenal, you can see Spurs want to play attacking football but are just getting frustrated at every turn. Arsenal is just controlling the game and missing every opportunity.  Spurs leading at half and my buddy is raving how the amazing Arsenal could be trailing to a shit team like Spurs and how the Gunners would come out and score a barrage of goals and win.

Second half starts and he prediction is about right Arsenal notches one not long after the half starts and then quickly afterward get one from Ade to go up 2-1...Arsenal looks the much better team, Spurs are trying to fight but aren't doing much. Time is running down and my friend is rattling on about how he was right but that Gunners should have about 4 more goals and where we will be drinking that night.

Sure enough 90min/injury time Jermaine Jenas....THE Jermaine Jenas (who i will always have a place in my heart but who i would gladly help move if it got him the fuck off this team) hits a fucking dart from around 30yards and ties it up....what a fucking shot. At that moment all the Gunner propaganda went out window as the combination of WHL and the underdog effect hooked me to Spurs.  Ever since then i have become more and more obsessive about this team.

**TL;DR** **Got brought to WHL by a gunner, loved the place, THE Jermaine Jenas hooked me to Spurs**

But it drives the engine core that enables the rest through things like the money multiplier. You seem like a curious guy. Read a bit more economics and history and you will see this is possible, just not probable.

Second, he waited because he loved her, not vice versa.  The Doctor said ""Come with me, we'll fix this"" and he stayed to make absolutely SURE she was safe, even though the pandorica was indestructible.  Really, that was poor writing to be honest.  
Essentially, he gained nothing by waiting for her in respect to loving her.  If he didn't love her before, he wouldn't have waited, and in all honesty the wait would more likely dampen their relationship than anything else.  In fact, I'd say that canonically it does.

Did they ask open, leading questions to help determine what you needed? Were they polite, well presented and attentive? These are things the interviewers are looking for in a customer service rep. 

I personally think going and talking to the staff can only be a good thing.

I had already decided to give you the job then, the interview was just a formality."" I had shown that I had a) could speak to new people confidently and politely and b) shown initiative. GAME was such a great job, shame it pretty much went bust :(

This event would be in the doctor's personal future, so we won't see it until a later episode.  Things in this episode the theory might explain:

- The very fact that River is in New York waiting for Rory when he gets there (or was that explained and I missed it?  All I got was her showing him the vortex manipulator)

- Outside the TARDIS River was very gung ho about Amy getting touched by the angel (this really seemed weird to me)

- I also don't really get why the Doctor thinks he can't go back and pick them up, but I kind of recall River reinforcing this belief

Mostly I hate to see Amy and Rory go in such a cheap way.  I understand it's consistent with their characters a bit and they in theory get to live a life together.  It still just doesn't seem right.

He'll just show up a year or years later and keep dragging you along. Would you prefer the Ponds just told the Doctor to F off? Nope, they gotta go where they can't be reached so that they can later be rescued for a special or what have you when the actor is ready to come back.

I'm pretty sure anyway.  Correct me if I got any of that wrong.  

Also, I agree with Alpaca below me.  A picture or some physical evidence of Rory and Amy living out the rest of their lives would've been nice.  Just like Kathy in Blink, or D.I. Shipton's photo of him and his wife.  The afterward to the novel was nice, but I would've liked some more.

All in all though, I liked the way their departure was handled.  I remember reading something that Karen Gillan had said about Amy needing to be killed off because she'd never leave the Doctor of her own free will.  The lead up with the two of them having new lives was great, and having them being forced to leave like that only to get their ""normal"" lives out of it was pretty great.

My best friend hit me up on Saturday: 

""So, your boy from Lake Nac scored the winner against the Mancs. You must be in seventh heaven, now?""

And, really, without a doubt, Clint Dempsey is my favorite American player, he grew up in a place geographically and culturally close to me, and reminds me a lot of my family and friends.

And, without a doubt, Spurs are my favorite English team (my favorite team ever is still Houston Dynamo, but that's another story), and have occupied that role for years.

But, what of the Dempsey signing? How do I feel right now?

I had to explain to my friend the following:

*The last two months have been like Christmas morning. You're opening up present after present, and you scarcely have time to appreciate one and enjoy it because you're on to opening up the next one. At present, the Dempsey hire is wayyyyy down on my list, and this is why...*

**Things BiscuitCrisps is super-excited about, but hasn't had time to mentally unpack and appreciate fully (in rough order of importance)**

1. The arrival of a manager who has a vision and style of play
2. The fact that that vision meshes remarkably well with the 'swashbuckling' style that we've seen emerge, organically, from this Tottenham side in the past half-decade
3. The fact that AVB's been given a new lease on life and he's emotionally vested in our side 
4. **JAN MOTHERFUCKING VERTONGHEN**. Easily the best signing of the transfer window. I am dumbfounded at how good this guy is. He's got MotM in the bag for the balance of the season. Captain Material.
5. The development of Sandro into a box-to-box mid, swinging from destroyer to creator in a matter of seconds. Oh how pleased I am with his growth
6. The arrival of Dembele, who's really done a fine job filling the hole where our little Croatian genius lived
7. Jermain Defoe getting a new lease on life, and returning to his previous form
8. The fact that AVB is going to contest Europa League!!!
9. Gareth Bale's link-up play, forming a super-effective left flank attack
10. Caulker really stepping up his game, practically begging for a starting spot 
11. Brad Friedel's continued dominance in net
12. The signing of Adebayor (who will set nets on fire, once again)
13. The signing of Lloris (who is our future, mon dieu!)
14. The fact that we're performing so well without Parker, Kaboul, and BAE (who will all be back soon)
15. Squad Rotation. AVB knows how to do it!
16. And **Clint Dempsey**

Not that I'm not excited about the hire. I'm fucking delighted, it's just that I've got so much other stuff I'm unpacking, I can't even begin to appreciate it.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"Mass production and economies of scale are the best use for the arable land we have in the world. Lets paint a picture.

As see levels rise, arable land decreases. As arable land decreases the cost of food increases as a natural product of the decreased ability to supply.

People have been, for a long time, advocating the use of ""locally sourced ""organic"" food"". ""Organic"" food, typically, has a lower yield than food that uses pesticides - if it didn't then this would likely be an anomaly caused by good weather and strange ecological factors. 

Furthermore, wheat, when it undergoes stress - caused by perturbations to it's environment - releases signals that, essentially, cause the other parts of the crop to produce natural pesticides that are a) more harmful than real pesticides and b) render much of the crop unusable.

Quite simply, If you want sustainable food don't buy organic. We can argue about human interference in ecosystems but what people really care about is the subjective quality. We don't have the opportunity to go back to the 1600s (without mass death), so we are where we are.

Economies of scale and mass production mean that a feeding a growing planet is possible.

This is just food, though, but public ownership i,e- those that produce collectively own, seems to be the way forward in this market. Also, an acceptant of science as opposed to angry raging Luddite every time someone mentions GM foods.

I think the Doctor said that the faith the Minotaur took advantage of didn't necessarily have to be religious. Indeed (if I'm remembering this correctly), didn't it feed off Amy's faith in the Doctor? This implies that Rory wasn't immune because of a lack of religion (though this may well have been true also), but because he lacked faith in *anything*, even the people around him. Which has always struck me as a slightly depressing thought.

&gt;  He wasn't surprised at the Tardis because he had been reading up on it in the two years since the Doctor's previous visit. 

Good catch. While I didn't realize this fact and might not have even thought it through, I don't remember being surprised by his lack of surprise. His reaction to comatose hospital patients walking around outside had been rather phlegmatic, so I just thought he wasn't that excitable.

I think in a customer service role like that you need to be professional and friendly at the same time making small talk after the sale when you take the payment. Let them decide what they want or advise them on a similar product and strike up a conversation. Yeah, it's only a job but it shows you are interested and care about the customer which is what they want to see.

IMO it is shaming them for a very good reason. 

If an MP was a rapist, they wouldn't be allowed to be an MP any more. But if an MP is innumerate, or utterly ignorant of STEM subjects, that's supposedly OK. But it isn't OK, because there is no fucking way they can make competent decisions if they have zero understanding of the subject matter or ability to bo basic maths, whereas a rapist, even though they are a bad person, is not necessarily incapable of making competent decisions on how the country is run. 

The MPs who failed this should be named and shamed.

&gt; But realistically MPs were never meant to be our superiors,

They make the rules we have to follow. That means in practical terms they are our superiors. Though clearly they are not the intellectual superiors of most Redditors or of much of the general public.

&gt; and the premise that they should be is why we have almost exclusively ivy league school boys

That's an inapppropriate Americanism. I think you mean ""expensively privately educated"".

I would imagine places like Eton and Fettes teach maths competiently. If people like Cameron and Blair don't learn (and I'm not saying that those individuals got the test wrong, merely that many MPs with similar backgrounds failed the test), despite all the advantages and top quality education they've had, they they are fucking stupid.

true,B4mf0rth,null,null,"That might be the intended message, but that isn't the message the author conveys. 

1: She assumes her own assumptions about why the police failed in this case are true. ""The police wrote her off because she was poor, working class, not innocent, not worth the effort etc etc"". I find it hard to believe the police of Greater Manchester, many of whom grew up in that area, wrote off the girl because she was poor. Far more likely, it got placed to low priority because the girl actually had a home with two parents (not homeless), and the crime had an extremely low conviction probability - it is a consequence of underfunding rather than a lack of morals. Hindsight is a blessing, but I think her class had very little to do with it. 

2: She is making it a class issue when it just wasn't. Her assumption that the media focuses on the Stammers case because she is pretty and middle class is just misplaced. Remember the Shannon Matthews a few years back case? That had an even bigger public and media reaction than the Stammers case, and Matthews was very much a working class girl. The author has very strong neo-feminist views which seem to direct her towards conclusions that encourage those views, rather than reflect the truth. She even attacks the Daily Telegraph for making assumptions before making her own.

3: The media doesn't have an obligation to order its stories in terms of moral impact. It never has, and I very much doubt it ever will. Even if it did, unfortunately there would be a lot of stories a long way before local area sex gangs. 

4: I find her allocation of blame interesting. She goes for the police and social services, which although there were certainly clear and avoidable failings with their service, were also clearly not failings of malicious intent. I'd think if I was the parent of a girl that age, I'd have a moral obligation as a parent to ensure their safety and happiness. Obviously there is difficulty in talking to parents about such things, but there are also difficulties talking to complete strangers in black uniform with stab proof vests and handcuffs. And you'd think would think over 4 years, including a warning from the police that the child may be involved in consensual prostitution and had a child of her own, a parent might start taking an interest in their child's life which could uncover such an shocking thing, and start taking measures to stop it from happening. The author cannot lay blame purely with the authorities because they can only pry so far in to people's lives, especially once they are over 16. But she does so anyway. 



I'm not saying that girls who have the courage to come forward about issues like this shouldn't be provided with far greater care than they are, but this article does a crap job of advocating that.

true,stulofty,scottish,Scotland,"I just had an interview with them about 8 weeks ago. Did lots of research before I went in, a couple of days before the interview. I would do the same, look into the site and get an understanding of the company. This is my first job so experience isn't really an issue its more about selling yourself.

Main point to think about: Boots is 100% focused on customer service. During my first few weeks I was pushed to make sure every customer received excellent customer service and the same level of attention from me. 

The interview was 50% standard in a room and questions and 50% on the floor.
The questions were pritty standard, what you have done, what you want to do, why Boots? etc etc. If you research interview questions they are quite simple.

The floor section (at least in Edinburgh) no longer does the basket handing out, rather you are taken to the item you have chosen and you try and sell it, I chose a electric beard-groomer and ended up talking about 3 different products based upon charge time, price and different settings. 

After that I was walked around the store and was told to point out someone who looks like they need help, it was really nerve racking at first but you have to get over it. After you pick someone/a few people they asked me how I could help them, based upon their section etc, how I could sell something to them. 
After that i was asked to approach 3 customers and ask them for help. If there was something i couldn't help with the interviewer jumped in.
Just approach someone and ask ""is there something i can help you with?"" or something along those lines.

After that i was taken to the sun-cream section and asked what i would do to improve the section, they are looking for pulling the products forward, making sure that products are in the correct places, there is price tickets where required, the deal signs are correctly placed etc.

While I also applied for a Customer Service job, they tend to call it an Operations job which is 75% stocking shelves, 20% serving customers and 5% on tills. You could also be just ""Cash and Wrap"" which is just till work but tends to be shorter hours.

Some background: I originally come from a computer science background. Before I changed career paths I was earning close to £80k per year. And the people I worked with were earning comparable amounts.

I worked with a guy, who lived at home, who was, at his worst, £30K in debt. He paid a third towards his Moms mortgage, and half the food costs. The rest of his salary - which was in excess of £6K per **month** was his to spend as he deemed appropriate.

The guy was in debt up to his eyeballs.

- - -
People from all walks of life, and from all socio-economic backgrounds can adapt the ""get now, worry later"" approach. My credit rating - and credit limits, are comparable today, to what they were in the past. I could walk into central Birmingham and blow £10K on my credit card.

I won't, because that's not my approach to spending money.

I understand what you're saying - but I disagree with the notion that people can't budget, if they're on welfare. Like I said, I write these budgets on a regular basis. And most people are capable of sticking to them.

The one problem I have, is how they'll transition claimants from fortnightly onto monthly payments.

The only change is that I never really wanted him at Spurs. I just didn't think he'd fit (especially with VDV here) and expected him to go for twice the price he went for (never thought he'd still be at Fulham with 12 months left on his deal). I thought his Liverpool move was pretty much a done deal. I'm happy he's here and that he'll raise Spurs' profile in the US. He won't be as ""important"" for Spurs as he was for Fulham, but he'll be a solid player for us and USMNT.

Transfer that ideology to a situation like Iraq, and you have people who accept killing anyone who isn't one of us, because they are the bad guys.

true,nofelix,uk,London/Brum,"A fried breakfast is very straight forward to do badly. Doing it well takes a bit more care.

* The eggs should be very fresh. Take them out of the fridge for a while to let them slowly reach room temp before cooking.

* Use butter for frying. Sausages should be cooked low for about half an hour, bacon takes about 10 - 15 mins. Vegetables like mushrooms and tomatos take 5 mins .

* Once your sausages, veg and bacon are nearly done, push them to one side of the pan. Make sure you scrape any bits that have fallen off away from the area for the eggs. Add a bit more butter so that there's plenty.

* Put the pan on a low heat. Let the butter melt while the pan cools a little.

* Crack the eggs very gently into the pan. If they're violently sizzling and popping it's too hot. Add ground black pepper to top of eggs. Let them cook slowly for about 5 mins.

* Put the bread in the toaster.

* The tops of the eggs will have uncooked whites, so to solve this you either use a plastic spoon to drizzle melted butter over them, or flip them. Drizzling butter is by far easier, just don't use a metal spoon on a nonstick pan.

* Toast pops. Turn off heat from pan. Butter toast on plate, transfer pan contents to plate. Consume with fresh orange juice and black coffee.

The alternative way to do eggs is to do it on a high heat with a *lot* of butter and basically poach them. This is more difficult though.

true,Wibbler72,null,null,"I can tell that pensions are confusing to most people and there are may fears and assumptions that are also inaccurate.  You have two choices - the first is to do nothing and hope your state pension (basic state pension after 30 yrs is currently £107 pw) is enough to live on...or suck it up and accept that you will live for 25+ yrs after retirement and will need to fund any sort of decent standard of living.  Do not make the mistake of looking at parents and grandparents generation (they saved more and didn't buy as much disposable crap) who had a better rate of accumulating state pension as they didn't live as long and had paternalistic employers.  As much as it may anger you, it is a fact that we live 2.5 - 3 x longer than when the state pension was effective.  If you do not invest in pension funds with some element of risk (you will have a choice of where to invest so empower yourself by knowing about them), you will be in the situation where your funds are not beating the pace of inflation.  If your employer is funding part of your retirement then do not cut off your nose to spite your face because you think the state should do this for you.  What if nothing changes and you have very little to live on because of negativity?

My advice on a small scale is that it is all about timing.  Work out how long everything takes and work backwards.  There is nothing worse than one thing not being hot or something being over cooked.  My advice is to make sure that everything is cooked in its own pan so that you can do them all at the same time.

Cook sausages slowly in a grill.  Add the bacon near the end.  Hash browns should be in the oven.  Mushrooms and tomota go on about the same time as the bacon in a frying pan.  If you're going to fry your egg you can do it in the same pan, but for scrambled you'll need a fresh one (or do it in the microwave).  Whilst you're dishing up put the beans in the microwave to put on the plate last.

In order to compete on a global stage (which is the case today even if one cannot see it directly) one needs to have a skill. I am not saying everyone is to be an engineer or programmer, just that they should train and educate themselves to be the best in whatever field it is that interests them.

When I hire an engineer, I have to make a stark choice between a local (expensive) engineer or someone in China/Russia or India. the local engineer has to have something that the others don't have to justify the extra cost.  We need a workforce who can generate value. We have done it before in our history, we have had a very proud engineering history based and sheer hard work, entrepreneurship and ingenuity. This is something I often don't find with offshore engineers, that are excellent engineers, but ask them to innovate something new and it will most often fall flat on its face.
