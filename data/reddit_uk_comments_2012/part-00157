true,Xaethon,cnty-uk,Manchester &amp; Salop,"Basically what Ianvisits said.

There was the English Civil War in the 1600s, which saw the roundheads (parliamentarians) overthrow the cavaliers (roundheads). Cromwell became Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England (and Scotland and Ireland soon after).

So we were now essentially a republic, with the monarchy no longer holding any claim to ruling the land like what happened in other countries which overthrew the monarchy. However, parliament soon decided (after a Cromwell's death), that they wanted the monarchy to return so they asked Charles II to become king (hence we're now a constitutional monarchy, more so than before the civil war), so that's the [restoration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoration_\(England\)). All monarchs are therefore chosen by parliament basically, and they have the right to remove one. [Look at this, for example (sort of).](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorious_Revolution)

I can't remember it, but I'm sure there's an Act of Parliament somewhere stating that only descendants of X are in succession, that claims to the monarchy by descents of earlier ones are invalid, and that parliament has the right to choose who is the monarch.

Edit: Yes, Parliament chooses the monarchy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689
---
&gt;Also, in a prelude to the Act of Settlement to come twelve years later, the Bill of Rights barred Roman Catholics from the throne of England as ""it hath been found by experience that it is inconsistent with the safety and welfare of this Protestant kingdom to be governed by a papist prince""; thus William III and Mary II were named as the successors of James VII and II and that the throne would pass from them first to Mary's heirs, then to her sister, Princess Anne of Denmark and her heirs and, further, to any heirs of William by a later marriage. The monarch was further required to swear a coronation oath to maintain the Protestant religion.

[From the act itself.](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/WillandMarSess2/1/2)
&gt;The said Lords Spirituall and Temporall and Commons assembled at Westminster doe Resolve That William and Mary Prince and Princesse of Orange be and be declared King and Queene of England France and Ireland and the Dominions thereunto belonging to hold the Crowne and Royall Dignity of the said Kingdomes and Dominions to them the said Prince and Princesse dureing their Lives and the Life of the Survivour of them And that the sole and full Exercise of the Regall Power be onely in and executed by the said Prince of Orange in the Names of the said Prince and Princesse dureing their joynt Lives And after their Deceases the said Crowne and Royall Dignitie of the said Kingdoms and Dominions to be to the Heires of the Body of the said Princesse And for default of such Issue to the Princesse Anne of Denmarke and the Heires of her Body And for default of such Issue to the Heires of the Body of the said Prince of Orange.

All the characters introduced in the serial are one-dimensional and childish *by necessity of the plot*, and the tasks given to the Doctor's companions (who are the focus of the serial) are inane and simplistic by a similar necessity.

Thank you for contacting me about the forthcoming Police and Crime Commissioner
elections. You raise some very valid points.

I have signed a contract of impartiality with the Labour Party and the successful candidate
will also have to sign a similar declaration.

I have pledged in meetings and on doorsteps across the county, that I will not privatise
the police. We police by consent, and it is important that warranted officers remain
independent.

I have no connection with companies that might bid to run police services and I do not
believe that private companies should be involved.

I attach a copy of a statement that I have recently released on this matter.

I have a strong record of listening to people and acting on their concerns. I will be a Peopleâs
Commissioner, a strong and effective leader of Nottinghamshire Police, while always
listening to you.

Thank you for e-mailing me.

 

I am already on record (radio Nottingham) as promising not to privatise policing working with G4S or whoever.

 

I include in this any functions both frontline and support.

 

Already Nottinghamshire Police is tied into the PFI building contract at Riverside and the private contract with Vensons for the provision of the vehicle fleet.

 

Both cost more (and provide less) than if the Force provided the facilities directly.

 

As a true independent I have no connection with any company or organisation that would be interested in Police contracts.

 

For further information on me and to read my manifesto please visit my website www.malcolmspencer4pcc.co.uk

 

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions.

How far away is it? About 5 minutes, 10 if you're slow. Not a ball ache to get there, but there generally isn't a reason to walk this way out of town unless you live that way.

Probably, but depends what was in it. Take a look at West Park in Whitmore Reans as an example. A little further out of town, but is a decent meeting place for people. Depends what you want to put in there really. Although I do suggest a skatepark as the current one at Penn Island might be getting closed down, and is also just a crime target, even more so now there is only one entrance in and out. Only other place for the skaters to go is the indoor mini ramp (only open from 5pm) or go skate the Civic Centre like we used to in the old days.

I like a mix of old and new, but I would want the new more tastefully done than the grey of Sainsbury's. Also remember that the listed building you will be using are part of the old hospital. A lot of local people remember it as such so if you go treating it badly, prepare for uproar till people get used to the idea. It happened with Sainsbury's as well according to my Mum.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Doesn't theology hold the correctness of Christianity as an axiom? 

Not at all, and I'm very sad to hear that your friend found his/her course like that! I quite like the way Wikipedia puts it: theology ""is the systematic and rational study of religion and its influences and of the nature of religious truths."" So it doesn't even have to be Christian.

A first point to make would be that there are many ""Christianities,"" many different groups and sects with different beliefs. It'd be impossible to get them all to decide on common ground for what Christians actually believe, never mind moving beyond that!

Secondly, theology as a field is massively varied. While some folks are still discussing how to interpret the Bible correctly in fairly traditional ways (see: [Walter Moberly](http://www.dur.ac.uk/theology.religion/staff/?id=671) ), the atheist Slavoj Å½iÅ¾ek will claim that ""to become a true dialectical
materialist, one should go through the Christian experience,"" Alitzer will claim that [God is dead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._J._Altizer#.22Death_of_God.22_controversy), Peter Rollins might suggest that [Christianity holds doesn't have the answers (but is all the better for it)](http://peterrollins.net/?p=3712), Bloch suggesting that [Christianity holds atheism at it's heart](http://newhumanist.org.uk/2151/atheism-in-christianity-by-ernst-bloch), Bultmann will talk of a [demythologized Bible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Bultmann#Beliefs_regarding_Jesus), Gustavo Gutierrez reinterprets sin and salvation into [his context of oppression and poverty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavo_Guti%C3%A9rrez#Liberation_theology), etc etc.

Basically, the words and traditions of Christianity have been re-interpreted into various contexts over the past 2000 years with varying levels of success. Unfortunately the average church institution seems to have got stuck in the middle ages, but the reinterpretation continues.

I also think it ties in marvelously with the theme of Doctor *Who* question should never be answered - they don't know who he is anymore so they will ask. 

Not to mention humanoid Daleks who don't know they're Daleks! That adds a modern layer to the Daleks which I think could prove interesting.

2) Amy seeing the Daleks as people (A ballerina, a classy gentleman etc) was such a great scene.

3)  [The BBC has advertised this so it's not a huge spoiler but ](/s ""Souffle girl is going to be the next companion - at least the actress is. Assuming they'll be the same character it could be really cool having the Doctor know the final fate of his next companion - becoming a Dalek!."")

So yea they didn't do much Dalek-fanboy shout outs - the whole point felt like to move away from that and start fresh, which I really welcomed.

Yea the Amy/Rory subplot was poorly executed. But they didn't cop out saying that the nanobots didn't affect the doctor because they didn't affect the doctor when they were first introduced a few years ago either (if I remember correctly).

Also, I thought the ""eggs"" thing was cute because ""Souffle girl"" was obsessed with baking, AND she was a Dalek, so combining ""Eggs + Stir"" with EXTERMINATE - it felt natural for her to say eggs and stir before she went full Dalek. + plus the doctor always asking about the milk.

true,givemeabeerenema,present,,"At the risk of downvotes, why not now? Honestly, Chelsea are getting a bad rep for keeping him as captain. Sure he's a leader on the pitch and no matter what he'll put 110% in to his game, but his image has forever been tarnished with the accusations and it reflects badly on the club. Also there are reports CFC won't even offer him a new contract at the end of next season because of this whole affair. 

After watching the league cup clash with Man Utd and seeing Cech coming over to calm the waters after the Nani/Oscar clash, I was extremely impressed and think he could take over this season. 

Or we could go the way of the past: give the captaincy to a young lad to lead us in to a new era (for those who don't know what I'm on about, Ray Wilkins taking over Ron Harris's captaincy way back when, he was 18 btw). I'm actually warming to this idea. Give it to one of the younger players who's likely going to be with us for the next 5 or so years. I have a feeling Oscar could do that for us. Once his English improves, I can see him being very diplomatic and calming during confrontation. I can see him being deployed more and more centrally which would mean his influence would increase on the overall play of the game and he could start dictating play.

Most of my working life after leaving the sea I worked in an organisation with close ties to certain members of the Royal Family thus extending the my brain washing.

Recently I sat down and decided to try to justify to myself why I support the institution.  I then realised that all the justification arguments were worthless.  There was only one argument that could wash when under close inspection.  This is the fact that the majority of the British people would not want to change the present arrangement.  So therefore because of this the monarchy must stay, albeit the reason for the general acceptance is the establishment's efficient propaganda machine.  Nowadays I get annoyed by the sacred worship by the media of this institution, particularly by the BBC who are almost creepy in their devotion and influence on society as a whole.

Specifically I guess I'm saying that we in the UK at last have a sort-of-compromise government and that our traditional left/right politics died the day Blair got in. The rest of Northern Europe is already established in compromise/centre-alligned politics because let's face it politics is largely done according to the old rules of the 20th century. New politics is either tame/neutered at a local level or established in the middle of everyone's opinion. Or you are French, and your voter apathy will follow ours inevitably.

I think one of the problems lies with trickle-down economics. Now, I'm not an economist. I'm a sound engineer doing a broadcasting degree (I managed to get in before the tuition fee hike). I'd like to see the implementation of the Robin Hood tax to alleviate the bite of the cuts. I haven't yet heard an argument that effectively counters that.

Then there's Vodafone, Starbucks and Topman who have all been accused of being party to tax avoidance schemes. I'd like to see some effort to close loopholes but I can't see the current government doing much about that, lest they appear hypocritical or upset their core.

I'd like to see investment into green technologies, especially in a place like Middlesbrough where there is wasteland (the Middlehaven site where St Hilda's used to be) that can be built on and where there is a generation of unemployed young people with very little in the way of ambition and prospect. Especially considering the instability of the service industry, for example First Source recently took over Barclaycard Operations in Thornaby to outsource jobs to the Philippines. Garlands Call Centre in Middlesbrough closed down with hundreds of job losses ensuing in about 2010. I know a lot of people who have given up searching for a job now because there just aren't enough sectors open to them.

Investment in education, skills and manufacturing. That is why I like what George Osborne has proposed for space tech. It's an unexpected step in the right direction from a man who has seemed to savagely cut for idiological purposes and caused us to fall further into recession.

and with good reason.

All great players have their key player, Messi has Iniesta, Ronaldo has Xabi and Torres had Gerrard. 

Gerrard very clearly for all to see was the key that unlocked Torres scoring master class.

Torres went to Chelsea over estimating his self ability (possibly even assuming that there would be others that could do what Gerrard can) and when he found that AVB gave him the lone wolf role he failed miserably because he was not the all in one dribbling master that Suarez is and is not built to carry the ball across a long distance. 

he was blind to the fact that Gerrard had repeatedly gifted him opportunities that Torres in turn finished.  

We all know examples of great players that left a club sucked hard then have moved on or back and returned to form, Torres may be another famous case but you cant judge his performance at Chelsea to his Liverpool one because he plays a different role in a different set up.

However, my own 'fundamental' view on the issue doesn't come from fiscal arguments but rather from the simple notion that nobody is 'better' than anyone else due to the fact that they emerged from the correct vagina. The ancient premise (afaik) behind the monarchy is that they are chosen by a certain deity to lead the people of the land.

As I don't believe in any deity I don't agree that anyone can be chosen by a god to rule. And even if we ignore the god part (which I imagine many people do) I still don't agree with the idea that your hereditary automatically leads to rights (other than private property, but that's another matter) or privilege.

TL;DR - Money should have nothing to do with it - having a monarchy is essentially saying: ""These people are better than all of us because of their parents.""

LOVE AND GOSH DARN MONSTERS! ok, let me take it down, each step. the beginning part had a cool and different looking narrative, and started gave the perspective of a typical person (which was implemented and worked well in Torchwood). the way it fails is... its too boring and has nothing to do with the doctor. i can stretch my imagenation far enough that there would be a group of people trying to find out who the doctor is. this is realistic enough, but what really starts to annoy me is when the main ""villain"" shows up. he says that he can help get more information on the doctor, and that everyone was getting sloppy. ok, first of all, how the hell does this guy know where these people are meeting? second of all, why the hell does everyone let this guy be their monarch? after a while, people want to leave, and then they ""mysteriously"" vanish after talking to the evil monarch dude. after like the 5th person unexpectedly vanishes, the remaining 3 people decide to leave, oh wait, no. the girlfriend of the main character (he had no real personality, and was the main focus of the episode) decided to go back to the evil monarch guy alone. WHY? oh, she forgot her keys. 

so, then it turns out the evil monarch guy is really... an evil monarch ALIEN! a twist so obvious that a blind person could see it. you see, whenever somebody touches him, they are absorbed into his skin, and he feasts off of ""knowledge"". why not just go up and absorb a teacher, or a political figure then? why spend months waiting for these random peolpe to ""learn"" more?

but that doesn't matter. the main protagonist guy then runs away from the alien, and somehow meets the doctor. the doctor does some science, and the alien dies. all of the absorbed people are all going to die in peace. everyone, that is, except the girlfriend. she gets turned into a wall for the rest of her life. 

and just to top this all off, apparently the doctor, through a flashback, came to the main protagonist when he was a child.... for some reason. i really don't remember why the doctor did this, but whatever.

even with everyone i just said, my main problem with the episode is this: it was all a vlog. WHAT?? NO. NO. NO. WHY DID THIS HAVE TO BE A VLOG? Literally everything that happened was already told through the perspective of this guy, so why did it have to be a vlog? nothing is brought from it! its just tacked on for no reason!

in the end, only one good thing came from this episode. Blink. Blink is everything this episode should have been, and was. to shorten the explanation, these non-doctor focused episodes were used to save time for the christmas episodes. two or three non-doctor episodes were needed, and love and monsters got enough views (somehow), to get another episode of this style.",0,1352516451,null,0,false,0,c6z3xb3,t3_12xwm6,t1_c6z3xb3,t3_12xwm6,null,1430366782,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

And no, I'm afraid anything that anyone says ever, particularly on the internet, has to be taken as serious. 100%.

Avoiding your question is interesting? Not if, and I'm not sure that this occurred to you, one assumed it was rhetorical in nature, particularly after your opening gambit.

What. I. Think. Rep-re-sent. British. People? (Would you mind spelling something like that phonetically next time? Thanks.) Welcoming nature, stoicism, hardiness, humour, willingness to change, equality/liberalism (in some cases...), self-deprecation... - shall I go on or is that enough for now?

Off the top of my head I have no concrete surefire hit examples of songs that would imbibe those qualities but that's not really the point in hand - the issue is what is there now, and it's not like this topic has ever really come up and been discussed at length by the wider population, at least not in an obvious way (I'm sure it often does in the pub). An alternative many people go for is Land of Hope &amp; Glory (not that that represents my small list above), but I believe it has some unsavoury aspects.

&gt; Essentially, define what it means to be British.

I'm interested as to why you feel I should be suggesting this, when your approach is to stick with the song we have at present that most definitively does not describe us as a group in any way in the first place, except to give everyone else the impression that we enjoy pleading with ethereal beings to keep us subservient to our 'betters'.

You don't have to have a solution to recognize that there is a problem.

&gt; No need to rush; I'm going to bed.

How very kind of you, but I'll leave this here for when you wake up.

&gt; I think there are far taller hurdles to clear before we worry about

Part and parcel of the same problem. You've never heard people bring up the national anthem of an example as to how Christian our nation was/is/wants to be? I have. 

Catch 22-esque: Of course we're a Christian nation. We have [g]od in our national anthem, our children say prayers at school, our head of state is also the head of our religion, our politicians say prayers before meetings in the house etc.

Suggest removing one of those and you'll very often get a rebuttal citing all the others as evidence as to why that removal should not take place.

Back to you though: How small would adherence to Christianity become, or how unpopular would the monarchy have to become, before you'd say the song isn't really representative of us as a people?

Thank you. I have tried saying this to my American friends so many times, but I would have better luck trying to convince the pope Jesus was a Buddhist. 
The problem is that you are ruling a country based on a document that's, what, 250yrs old? The world then and now is practically incomparable, and i believe that although the constitution is great, it's not really necessary. Americans aren't any more or less free than Northern Europeans, and European countries are much more able to adapt to a changing world due to the fact that they don't have to go through the rigmorol of amending a constitution. 
Besides, Britain already has one -in fact it was the basis of the US one, with the freedom and all that- but it's more like a guide by which laws are written, as opposed to a law itself, allowing for the changes to laws and such as already mentioned. 
Anyway, in answer to your question; no, why bother getting rid of them? They're not hurting anyone, and they are pretty inconsequential in our lives. And they are part of the reason that London is the most visited city by tourists in the world.

First, some relevant facts:

* Whilst basically a hedge fund, JWH trades by following trends in various commodity, currency, debt and equity markets. The economic conditions, and **low** market volatility in the recent years have made life hard for these type of firms.

&gt;[Henry is only the latest prominent hedge fund manager to retire or return outside capital in recent years, joining the likes of George Soros, Carl Icahn, Caxton Associates' Bruce Kovner, Centaurus Capital's John Arnold, Duquense Capital Management's Stanley Druckenmiller and Farallon Capital Management's Thomas Steyer.](http://www.finalternatives.com/node/22070)

---------

* Henry is essentially cutting his losses. He is shutting down an operation which most likely is not profitable anymore - and perhaps might even be one that is draining his personal resources.

&gt;[That performance has faltered in recent years, slumping badly in 2012. The returns of Henry's five trading programs available for its investors have ranged from a loss of nearly 1% to a loss of over 21% this year, and a loss about 2% to a loss of about 32% over the past year, according to the firm.... In 2007, for example, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. withdrew about $600 million of investments from Mr. Henry's firm. The move left the firm with about $500 million.](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323894704578109034136385080.html)

-------

How will this news impact Liverpool FC? Only John Henry knows. However some things to consider:

* FSG is holding company independent of other business controlled by Henry.

* New York Times sold $68 million of their remaining share in FSG earlier this year. Henry, on the other hand, has been increasing his stake. Henry is not personally broke (that anyone knows of).

* Rumours regarding sale of Red Sox have been persistent (Red Sox's estimated value is in the neighborhood of $1 billion or more), but no stories about sale of LFC have surfaced. If, in the event Red Sox is actually sold, that could mean streamlining of FSG.

* Henry could decide to concentrate solely on his sports franchise in his *retirement* days

That said, may Liverpool FC be prosperous and successful in years ahead.

 I think his concern with Amy and River is more about ""damage"" as River calls it. Amy tells the Doctor that she thinks it has been ten years that she has travelled with him. We only see her for a period of about two or three years. Amy goes through so much loss and emotional trauma with the Doctor. Her eye lines are not simply a sign of age, but of stress. River gives the Doctor all her future regenerations, and does not want to show him that it has harmed her to do so.

So you're not just taking an equal percentage from everyone, but taking a very small amount in some place, and a huge amount elsewhere. Those businesses which are heavily affected then just up and leave. When Sweden introduced a transaction tax in the 80s:

&gt; During the first week of the tax, the volume of bond trading fell by 85%, even though the tax rate on five-year bonds was only 0.003%. The volume of futures trading fell by 98% and the options trading market disappeared. On 15 April 1990, the tax on fixed-income securities was abolished. In January 1991 the rates on the remaining taxes were cut in half and by the end of the year they were abolished completely. Once the taxes were eliminated, trading volumes returned and grew substantially in the 1990s

&gt; ...

&gt; The revenues from taxes were disappointing; for example, revenues from the tax on fixed-income securities were initially expected to amount to 1,500 million Swedish kronor per year. They did not amount to more than 80 million Swedish kronor in any year and the average was closer to 50 million.[45] In addition, as taxable trading volumes fell, so did revenues from capital gains taxes, entirely offsetting revenues from the equity transactions tax that had grown to 4,000 million Swedish kronor by 1988

From the Wikipedia page on Tobin Taxes. A Tobin Tax wont work unless it is pretty much global.

I agree with shifting to low carbon generation, but the problem is it is a lousy investment, because you struggle to get back the money that you put in. Better to invest in improved roads, fibre-optic, and things like that, which provide multiple returns on investment, and which will spur growth that doesn't rely on continued funding from outside. I agree about investment in skills though. I would favour going over to a Swedish model of helping people to retrain in a much more intensive way.

true,Milemarker80,null,null,"The issue is that they're replacing clinically qualified nurses and other clinicians with call centre operators working from a script. Yes, it's cheaper to NHS Direct, but it's more expensive to the rest of the NHS. A nurse is better qualified to divert a patient away from A&amp;E if the patient doesn't actually need to present - they're trained to take this kind of clinical risk. Call centre workers aren't.

So costs to NHS Direct go down, but it's highly likely that attendances at A&amp;E go up. Which cost more and cause the patient more stress and probably hassle getting to A&amp;E for what might be a minor complaint. Everyone loses - the patient, the taxpayer and the now over worked A&amp;E department.

NHS Direct is currently based on a 1st / 2nd and 3rd line system, with the initial point of contact being a call centre operator, the second line being nurses available for call backs and the 3rd line made up of GPs and specialists for calls that need them.  With these cuts, they're rejecting clinical risk and quality in favour of passing the buck to other, more expensive and already pressured parts of the NHS.

I've been involved with NHS Direct in the past and am now somewhat involved in the 111 procurement exercise and the whole thing is a mess. NHS Direct was working fairly well, taking a decent burden from A&amp;E and GPs nationally (although it does have its issues). The new system will be a patchwork quilt of variable services with huge differences in service, cost and quality.

We're currently anticipating a noticeable rise in costs locally associated with the new system - on the positive side of things, we're also planning on working with our 111 provider to ensure their pathways and service develop over time to be better than NHS Direct.

true,exotictrousers,uk,United Kingdom,"I don't think there is such a thing as a perfect constitutional set up. It all depends on a particular society and what you yourself feel is best. In response

1) the problem with the ""its undemocratic"" argument is - where do you stop? If we have an elected head of state then we should definitely have an elected house of lords. But hell, why should it only be the legislature that is democratic? Surely judges should be elected too? But if judges are elected, police commissioners will be too. And then the prosecutors (ie dpp/copfs). Nhs is important, so that should be elected. Our utility companies are very important to our day to day life - surely elect them too?

I labour the point, and I'm not saying you're advocating those things (maybe you do). My point is that democracy is not an absolute/either-or thing. Its a question of degree and where you draw the line. I think that, given our history and society, having an unelected but powerless monarchy is ok. I wouldn't pick it if we were starting again, but we're not. That's why I think the ""anti-democratic"" argument is quite a week one

2) I don't know enough about that whole thing to comment, but my understanding is that it wasn't the queen herself who made the call, but her Australian representative. But I don't know enough. What I would say is that its up to Australians to decide on their constitution. They haven't got rid of the monarchy

If you don't mind spending a bit more money, the nicest gin, by miles, is Hendricks. It's a very delicate tasting gin, best served with cucumber (*not* lemon/lime). It's a thoroughly delicious treat.

There are other nice Scottish artisanal gin's which are also lovely - such as Caorunn and The Botanist. Of them, I particularly like Caorunn. However, in my opinion, The Botanist is a bit too 'light' tasting.

Overall, I'd go for Hendricks with ice and chopped cucumber any day.

The same goes for freedom of speech - we have that to a lesser extent than in the US, but that's because we have stronger anti-hate speech laws. There are limitations on these rights anyway, so saying that ""people might actually know the law"" is incorrect; people will be more likely to be misinformed about the law, in my opinion.

Besides, having a codified constitution in this manner means that any changes to the law have to jump through extra hoops, even if the changes are popular.

At present the focus in Broadcasting is on Ultra-HD (4k resolution) and how to get it to as many homes as possible. Fibre optics seem to be the way forward. One problem is that, at present in many areas it's only workable to run to the street. The last mile is copper and, especially in older streets in inner cities and rural areas, it would cost an awful lot in investment to run fibre optics to the home.

But I've had an idea combining two very different technologies and if you could pick holes in it I'd be quite frustrated and grateful. Toilets, basically.

*sigh*.. suppose I better explain..

This is stranded LFC wage structure.. certain players can earn more than others based on international appearances, form, potential, image rights, coming through the academy bonus (pays well especially if you get used), signing fee negotiations, living/moving costs, such and such.

Its very, very important through out this to remember he's still **17**. 

Raheem is a big..no, Raheem is the **BIGGEST** prospect for the future we'd had since Gerrard. Id go as far to say he's one of the most highly anticipated players in Europe (this is back up by a lot of sports analysts and reporters), this is also amplified by the fact that he is (or atleast can play for) English.

Gaining such attention at such a young age attracts a LOT of interest from rich clubs who want to snap up stars early. 

* At just 17 he's a first team regular for Liverpool football club having come through the academy.

* He's represented England at under-16, under-17, under-19 and under-21 level and has now been called up for the senior England squad.

* He became the second youngest player ever to score in a competitive fixture for Liverpool, behind only Michael Owen

* His performance against Sunderland earned him a MOTM performance 

* Has been praised by BR as 'a wonderful talent'

true,Milemarker80,null,null,"It's irreversible. The contracts that are currently under development, out for tender or agreed are for 3-5 years and have gone to a mix of private providers (Care UK, Virgin, Serco mostly), social enterprises (mostly made up of NHS staff worried about the change) or NHS providers (NHS Direct, Ambulance Services or GP co-operatives).

Once those contracts are signed and services devolved, it's going to be extremely challenging to pull the service back into the NHS if it's left. And not only challenging, but expensive. It's all part of the chipping away of core NHS services and opening up the service to competition and the private sector. The historic system wasn't so broken that it deserved this - but this is the latest example of the current government taking a sledge hammer to break a nut.

Having said that, it's not all bad. If the NHS commissioner can afford to put the time and effort into drawing up good service specifications and can secure a provider who are willing to work with other local NHS services, there's a good chance we can make a better, more integrated service that's more responsive to local needs. NHS Direct, with it's national, one size fits all approach wasn't great at this.

But getting to that point of a better local service is going to take years and with NHS management funding being massively cut, it's debatable whether there's the capacity in the system to make it happen anymore. In the meantime, as I said above, it's going to be a mess - cost, quality and patient experience wise.

I don't know this for sure but it seems evident that Labour seats would be better protected under a Labour government. Under a Tory government they're just another drain on the economy.

It's a poor analogy, but it still works - kids aren't taught *why* something is the way it is.

Now, are there any people in this country who would stand to *benefit* from the general population believing that their self-worth and value to society depends on some sort of unexamined work ethic, and that the harder they work and less they're paid the more righteous and noble they are?

Because that is the subtext of articles hating on ""scroungers"" - including the fatcats at the other end of the scale. It's basically pro-work-ethic propaganda.

The work ethic is bollocks. If you find work that is stimulating, and / or have work that is genuinely useful and worthwhile: great. But there is *nothing* laudable about doing pointless work for a pittance in what is supposed to be an advanced society. 

There *is* something laudable about a society that helps out people in such a situation, and looks after them properly until they can find something worthwhile to do (and *actually* help them to find it). We *should* focus on achieving this, but never have. 

Centuries of technological innovation and financial growth have only increased the amount of time that everybody spends working, and getting to and from work, and reduced the amount of personal skill and pride involved in doing it. The actual number of genuine, bone idle workshy scroungers has always been pretty small, and would be smaller if there was more meaningful work available, and workers were treated as something more than just a variable cost.

It really is a hit-and-miss game with marking, candidates are being given much lower grades than they deserve - with that comes the potential to be denied entry onto A-Level courses. 

I cannot wait for the CompSci marking (being a programmer, myself) - there's no way they'll have enough programmers to mark the papers - I expect the examiners will make quite a few basic mistakes if a candidate has written a function another way than taught in the class, he could lose marks even though it is correct. 

Perhaps it's time for a major paradigm switch for secondary education. The US system is pretty good, the same with the nordic countries. Or even a more radical idea would be to get rid of standardized testing; each college could set its own exam (vectors, quadratics, algebraic fractions and or liner equations).

true,Learnincurve,derbyshire,Peak District,"More music, less religion in primary schools. It's absolutely outrageous the amount of religious studies they do our schools and they are doing it at the cost of things like music, languages and science to the point where your child has to do after school clubs to even do any at all. 

Our school just did a whole term of ""cultural studies"". Here's what happened, I live in a mining area (our taxi drivers are all white, that's how white this place is) and a few years ago our school got a reputation amongst the Muslim doctors at the hospital round the corner for being religious neutral and that parents were allowed to opt their children out of any Christian stuff, so a few more Muslim families came to the school along with some Hindus *because they wanted to teach religion at home*. 

All the children were getting along all fine and dandy not giving a flying fig about each other's religions and then we got the newish headteacher going ""hang on a second!!! we have non white people!! must make sure they all learn about each other's cultures!!"" and it's been getting steadily worse ever since. 

Also the one Chinese kid and the few black and Muslim kids are being put on all the pictures everywhere to make it look like it's a rainbow coloured school  (it's 90% white) which is royally pissing off their parents as it makes them look like they are different, when the only thing that's different about them is that their parents are richer than the locals. Not that any of the white parents care, it's not a freaking hotbed of religious tension round here and there has always been a truce between the locals and any hospital staff regardless of colour or creed.

I wouldn't be surprised if every single Muslim kid is moved to the private school round the corner next year because of this latest stunt. The doctor set have already stopped helping with any fund raising stuff which led to an amusing ""the school friends group only had 3 people turn up!!!"" letter from the head.

What I said: It's about an alien named ""The Doctor"" who travels through time in a spaceship that looks like a police telephone box, who saves people and other aliens with the help of his companions and a tool called a ""sonic screwdriver"".

What I meant:

&gt; It's about friendship and bravery and love and loss, and life and death and forgiveness and guilt, and being human and being less than human and sometimes a bit more than human, skill and intellect and sometimes a little bit of luck, finding extraordinary in the seemingly ordinary, looking up at the night sky and realizing you're part of an impossibly beautiful and mysterious universe and that you don't know all the answers no matter how clever your are.

&gt; It's about looking inside yourself and realizing you're far greater than the external conditions of your life: You're not a shopgirl, you're not a succesful medical doctor, you're not a temp, you're not a little girl who needs to grow up or a boy that thinks the love of his life could have done better. You're the most important person in creation and at the same time you're the most insignificant thing in the world, and having the ability to choose between the two at any given time is fantastic.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"To expand on my original post:

**The National Curriculum** as we know it today, was introduced in 1988 with the introduction of the **Education Reform Act.** It set the groundwork that schools â both primary and secondary [for any non Brits: Primary School covers ages 5 - 11; Secondary School covers, at the moment, 11 - 16. You can then do two years of college or sixth form, before if you chose, opting to do a Degree at 18.] must follow when putting together the lessons that children will be taught. More cynically it was introduced to bring about a uniform curriculum, which would allow for standardised testing, and the development of league tables, that parents could use to see which schools were âperformingâ better than others.

Whilst initially outlining standards for specific subjects, the National Curriculum has since developed to the extent that it dictates the vast majority of what is taught to students during the mandatory 11 years theyâre in state education. At this point itâs important to point out that whilst education upto the age of sixteen is mandatory in the United Kingdom, attendance at state run schools isnât. You can, for example, opt to home school children, though they will be assessed every now and then by the relevant local education authority, to ensure theyâre developing at the right speed.

The National Curriculum itself is taught across what are know as âKey Stagesâ. For students in England there are four âKey Stagesâ which cover the following ages:

* Key Stage 1: Ages 5 â 7.
* Key Stage 2: Ages 7-11.
* Key Stage 3: Ages 11-14.
* Key Stage 4: Ages 14 â 16.

Pupils are tested at various points in the school life, to see how theyâre progressing against expected targets, typically at the age of **seven** [to see how children are progressing at the very start of their learning], **eleven** [to see how they've progressed as they reach the end of their Primary school education, and to decide what difficulty sets they should be placed in when starting Secondary school] and at the age of **fourteen**, to determine which subjects should be studied for their final two years, as well as the level those subjects should be taught at.

Children then sit the âfinalâ exams of their mandatory education [which are usually qualifications called GCSEs] at the age of **sixteen**.

When these assessments work, they work brilliantly. I entered âMainstreamâ education at the age of seven, having been in special education prior to that. At that age I was assessed, and it was determined I needed extra help with reading and writing.

By the time I was tested again, at eleven, my abilities in both areas had improved drastically; at fourteen I tested off the charts on both of them.

The problem, however, is that these assessments donât always work. And that more brighter and gifted students can be left behind, due to a curriculum thatâs designed to cater for everyone.

**So what one thing would I change about the National Curriculum?**

For me, the curriculum is **far** too restrictive. Itâs designed to ensure students and teachers adhere to arbitrary standards that both restrict the formers ability to do their jobs, and the actual learning process for students.

So, if I were to suddenly find myself replacing either **Michael Gove** [*The Secretary of State for Education*, as of the writing of this post.] or **David Laws** [*The Minister of State for Schools*, as of the writing of this post.] on Monday morning? 

Put simply Iâd flip the status of the national curriculum, from one thatâs primarily designed to generate league tables and statistics, to one that actually allows teachers to teach, and children to learn.

Thereâs a saying Iâm fond of. Itâs likely a bastardised version of an earlier quote, but for me it sums up the main problem with mainstream education, at least in the United Kingdom:

&gt;We teach our children that two plus two equals four; that seven multiplied by seven equals forty nine. What we donât teach them is **why**.

I personally believe the twenty five words above, sum up not only most of my experience of mainstream education, but based on conversations with friends, relatives, etc. it represents a problem thatâs still prevalent to this very day.

We expect our children and young peopleÂ¹ to learn endless facts and figures, to be able to recite the order of the planets, or explain basic chemical formulae. To do this teachers and educators â who do a [mostly] thankless job are expected to devise a lesson syllabus that adheres to the âneedsâ of the national curriculum, whilst at the same time attempting to embed a little creative and constructive thought processes, into children.

**So Iâd overhaul it.** Iâd scale back the national curriculum back to a âminimum standardâ that schools were expected to deliver. This new national curriculum would be designed to teach students not only skills and abilities that theyâd need in the âreal / outside worldâ, but also instil critical thought processes, that theyâd find vital as they get older. I would then allow schools to set their own syllabus that ran in parallel to the national curriculum that allowed children to fully achieve the best that they were capable of.

**Some examples.**

**Overhaul the PSHE [Personal Social and Health Education] GCSE, making it not only mandatory, but more relevant:**

This subject, which could be delivered either as a standalone subject or integrated into other core subjects, such as Mathematics, would be designed to equip students of all abilities with the basic skills needed in adult life. For example â how many students leave school knowing what a mortgage is? Or know what a standing order is?

As part of  revised PSHE GCSE Iâd ensure children are taught the following skills:

* **Health and Nutrition**. How many kids [or for that matter, adults] actually know what a *Calorie* is? How about what *Saturated Fats* are? Iâd also ensure children are capable of putting together a basic set of essential meals, such as a few different breakfasts, soups, and main meals.
* **Financial responsibility**. Set students a âbudgetâ [Say the equivalent of the National Minimum Wage] and have them write an essay explaining how theyâd live on that budget. Explain to students not just what some of the more common financial acronyms such as *APR*, *VAT* etc. stand for, but what they are, and what to look for â for example, if the need arises to take out a loan. Or when it comes to *Mortgages*  - how to factor in the re-payment rates.
* **Critical reasoning**. Far too often people dislike something â*just âcause*â. You only need to look at the Kindle and eReader tags on tumblr to find proof of this. Iâm not suggesting children take part in full blown debates, but calmly debating an issue, and appreciating the input of people with different opinions and perspectives to their own, can only be helpful to them in later life.
* **Political Studies**. Now bear with me on this one, as the likely reaction runs along the lines of âWTF?!â Students who want to study politics in depth should absolutely be free to do so, however I also think that a rudimentary understanding of it is also important. 
Going back to the Health and Nutrition part â how many people actually know what a Member of Parliament does [or is supposed to do?]. 

Political studies would include a brief history of British politics, it would explain the difference to students between the *Common*s and the *Lords*, and explain â again not too in-depth, the role of National and Local Government. If we want people to engage in politics, I think it would help if they actually understood **how** it works â even if only on a basic level.


Iâd also over-haul certain subjects to make them more relevant to students. As an example Iâd change the  **I.C.T.** [Computing] curriculum so that it focused more on I.T. skills that are useful to students in the workplace. For instance:

* **Between the ages of 11 and 14** students would be taught how to correctly write and format a letter. How to prepare a CV, and how to use email. Whilst computing trends [imo] are set to continue to move to mobile computing, Iâd still recommend children at this age are taught a basic understanding of computer hardware. So for example, how to swap out a HDD, how to install an OS etc. Iâd also cover online safety, as well as a rudimentary introduction to programming.

* **Between the ages of 14 â 16** students who opt to study I.C.T at GCSE level would move onto more detailed learning. Theyâd learn different types of Databases [not just excel], how to use logic statements to extract information from databases. Iâd also include more detailed hardware knowledge, such as troubleshooting common PC problems, and either a programming, or  web related piece of coursework [such as putting together an online portfolio, for example].

Those are just some of the examples. I did, for a few minutes, contemplate actually going through the current National Curriculum and outlining the changes Iâd make to each subject, however Iâm not quite that mad in the head. So consider the above a âdraft reportâ â if, God forbid, I ever find myself as a Minister in a future Government, Iâll be sure to produce a more thoroughly fleshed out version

Having said that, they do have a better reputation than the Virgin and Care UK services (although watch them go downhill now!) and someone needs to provide the out of hours service to patients that they do since previous governments allowed local GPs to opt out of the service.  And yes - someone was going to make a profit in this area, this lot of doctors are as deserving of that as anyone else who started similar services years ago.

But it's the opting out that created this problem in the first place - I know there's plenty of areas looking at how they grab this service back in house with the increasing spread of private companies moving into providing out of hours cover and increasing concerns over the quality of those services.

There's also the significant problem that the government have just given control of huge NHS budgets to GPs - the Guardian article refers to one of them in the article as a Chair of a CCG. You'll find a lot of GPs involved in CCGs selling up any provider organisations they're involved in at the moment and this is a good thing. The last thing anyone wants is to have a GP running / holding shares in a provider and then throwing contracts at their own company, it's a conflict of interests.

It was just man giving a talk to a room full of his friends, using exactly the same sort of techniques newspapers use; taking things out of context, being selective, re-wording things, making suggestive jokes where he can't provide facts, picking and choosing.

I don't wish to stick up for the Daily Mail, it's a waste of paper, and it prints articles that in my opinion are not only objectionable but in some cases outright destructive. But is the best way to show this to just do the same thing back to them? To pick out selective instances and use hyperbole and exaggeration to make them seem like monsters?

Surely it would be better to be really straight about it, rise above it all and actually give a straight talk about their journalistic practices.

---

Like, he picked out a story where they printed a photo of Mel Gibson's Kid being called the 'new siri Cruse' and said (after calling Mel Gibson a racist for a laugh) ""Obviously at the age of 6 and a half siri cruse is very much over the hill, and frankly getting fat from all that ice cream""

Surely the truth is that they get a load of photos in the morning, and publish them because people want to see celebrity's kids, it sells papers, and they have to run a caption with it so put ""the new siri Cruse"" because they often run photos of Siri Cruse and their readers will know who she is. It's just lazy journalism, a stupid caption, and while it *may* indeed put pressure on these kids or even sexualise them as he suggests, I don't think they really sit around plotting it, editors saying to one another ""Obviously at the age of 6 and a half siri cruse is very much over the hill"", they just print it because they have to fill their shitty paper by 2am or they don't get paid.

The whole talk was him just deamonising the mail, to a crowd of his friends who hate the daily mail. It wasn't clever or insightful, almost every example was in that format - point out something the mail has done, exaggerate it, make a joke out of it until you get a reaction from the audience, move on.

I think anyone who eats this bullshit up is as dumb as the people who eat the bullshit up from the Daily Mail's offices.


* ""If you do a little search on their site for 'beyond her years' it's pretty much code for 'its ok to masturbate to this one'""

* ""The daily mail reporter, who presumably inhabits a sort of sleazy corner office where the walls are slick with sweat and semen stains.""

* Or how about when he was talking about the daily mail taking a survey out of context by re-wording it. They said *""one third of British Muslim students say it's acceptable to kill for islam""*. He then goes on to say this is terrible, since the original survey actually said *""Is it ever justifiable to kill in the name of religion? - And a third said- Yes, but only if that religions is under attack""* He then says the Mail are irresponsible for re-wording this to make it seem more shocking in order to pander to their audience. But while he is explaining it, he also re-words it, saying ""*and in fact, bearing in mind the vagueness of the questions asked, its not really that surprising that a third of people said ""yeah, ok, its ok to, you know, kill in order to defend your way of life"" in fact I'm surprised its only a third"".* - So here he is doing the EXACT same thing, re-wording the question to pander to his audience, but instead of making it more inflammatory making it less. Changing the word 'religion' for 'way of life' makes it much easier to relate too even though those things are not synonymous especially in this context, making the wording more casual, saying he is surprised its so low, using the term 'in fact' 'its not surprising' etc... its pure media manipulation, but because it's AGAINST the Mail I'm supposed to ignore it and listen to him talk for 20 minutes about how evil the Mail are when they try to manipulate me? Bullshit.

It's someone else's opinion. You may come across these on the internet. Try holding your head near a window.

We've all done shit jobs to make ends meet. I haven't said anything against self-reliance. 

My point is simply that there is nothing inherently laudable about meaningless work *for its own sake*, and that the society in which we now live renders an awful lot of work meaningless, and denigrates dignity of the people who do it in the process. 

The lucky among us have *professions* or *trades*. The trend in this country, though, for as long as I can remember, has been to reduce the role of the individual within companies and other organisations to be as generic as possible.

However, it was introduced in a really patchy way with some schools fully endorsing the idea of informing pupils about becoming citizens with proper timetabled lessons and some just saying they did it through other subjects. Throughout my training, and even now teaching it in a school, I have to battle for legitimacy against more established subjects like history or RE. 
Gove's changing of the curriculum, has caused even more challenges for citizenship which will leave us with yet another generation of kids who not only have no idea about the difference in political parties but no idea how to get their voices heard in the political system.  Engagement in democracy doesn't only mean voting but unfortunately the government of today doesn't seem to want young people voting OR getting involved in the political process.

The Mail, at least to me, seems to desire to mislead as persuasion as opposed to convince or entertain as persuasion. And, ultimately, his point that the Mail ultimately makes people feel less happy and makes people more scared and angry and hateful towards random sections of society is not something that is then done by the speaker. Of course he uses rhetorical devices to persuade people - we all do at all times. However, the Mails devices are not only less honest and lead people to incorrect conclusions, but have the effect of making people miserable and terrified.

true,Importanter,null,null,"I'd also cut compulsory language - it's useless, the kids don't want to learn you can't force them. The brain development stuff you reference - there are benefits for being multi-lingual from an early age (from parents/grandparents) and also being fluent at a later stage in life. The benefits attributed to each of these are slightly different but both positive. Students don't get anywhere near fluency. 

*No one* becomes fluent in french from GCSE or A-levels (or a University degree for that matter) alone, that's not the way it's setup. Nor do I think it could ever be setup for fluency and therefore you would never see benefits to your brain over any other type of lesson (say music - which I don't think should be compulsory either).

Students know English is the world language, they know it's quite pointless for them to learn a European language like French or German, every French or German they'll ever meet will speak English. Continental students are fluent (or near enough) in English and have access to English media, massive access, the internet is mainly English, all the best films, TV series or books are English, any vaguely worth while work in any other language has been translated into English. This is the reason they speak English - not because of better lessons in their schools. Our students already speak English (most of them) - they've won, they don't need another language to be successful internationally.

I was taught (along with my classmates) french from primary school up. I don't think any of them speak even basic conversational french.  The only way you could get a better language course is to massively focus on it and it's not worth the effort. Also we'd need cultural change so we might see some foreign language programming on television, interesting foreign language books / newspapers in bookshops but I don't see it happening outside of the capital because English versions are too ubiquitous. 

I say all this and I speak / read a second language fairly well. If I'd taken it at school it would have to taken me to an absolute laughably basic level, even by the end of a University course you wouldn't have native level fluency. 

This is putting words in your mouth that you might not intend but it sounds to me like you're thinking ""Oh I wish we'd been taught well at school - then I'd be fluent in another language, and I'd have much less chance of becoming senile"" but it doesn't work like that. You have to put in the work to learn a language to fluency, no class - even from nursery school is ever going to get you to fluency, it's just not enough exposure and not enough 1 on 1 time. The lucky few who get a language for ""free"" are those who learn it from birth from parents or relations.

All that said - I'd still have language as an option for those kids who are interested and into it.

As for a change I'd have everyone involved with education from the government down read John Holt's How Children Fail. The school systems that ours is built on treats everyone the same, it's worked pretty well for us but I think it's time to have teachers take on more of guiding role and steer children to their strengths. We don't need a load of factory workers anymore, more and more jobs are going to become automated, so you need students who are able to be responsible and control their own development.

I know many teachers who are really trying to make lessons relevant to today and what children need to learn to be functional citizens HOWEVER the importance of meeting a learning objective from the NC is the most important. When I was doing my PGCE year I was told that if an OFSTED inspector had been there then I would have had an inadequate lesson because the learning objective was not achieved- It was an R.E lesson where the children were learning about Jesus feeding the 5000, or were supposed to, instead it turned into a debate about how it could have possibly happened. The children were highly engaged and really questioning how Jesus could possibly have multiplied the food, some of the children were trying to think about ways that this could have been possible- anyway about 20 mins were ""wasted"" discussing the possibility of how that could have happened. In my training and during my PGCE year I was constantly told that moving children onto the set work was much more important than continuing a debate - even when the children were highly engaged. The problem is you are unlikely to be tested on a debate and it is difficult to use a a debate as evidence of achievement. I'm afraid whilst testing and league tables exist the life skills will be shunted in favour of more curriculum time for the tested material. I've been to schools that literally spend 3 out of 4 sessions of the school day on literacy and numeracy (literacy hour, numeracy hour, 30 mins of literacy intensive, 30 mins of numeracy intensive) leaving only the last sessions of the day for non core - 2 of those afternoons are P.E slots, everything else was on fortnightly rotation- 1 lesson every fortnight.

I'm really in favour of compulsory extra languages, but I grew up in a reasonably shit place too, and I agree about the loss of some of the skills and knowledge to keep a locality in good nick. But a lot of the localist thing is common to people all over the planet, and I think if kids could speak something other than English, it'd help them more today than it would have in the days before internets. I've recently started having to deal with people who don't speak English, and whilst online translation devices have made this possible, and will hopefully get better as time goes by, it's a pretty touch-and-go way to communicate with people. A 2nd Language is a regular criterion in job adverts around Tyneside these days, and there are not many people who can even think of applying. So even if it just helped increase employability, that's something not to be sniffed at. 

But aside from that, the general improvement in learning ability is worthwhile. Human brains seem to have an innate propensity to be polylingual, it makes sense from an evolutionary perpective that they would, as back in the day, small family group based tribes would have to deal with other tribes speaking different languages.

I would love our schools to actually get rid of year groups, instead have ability classes. I work in reception, I have 3 children in my class who are not ready to learn- they struggle to sit still, they cannot focus independently (they need an adult constantly re-directing their attention, they cannot hold a crayon/ paintbrush, any noise distracts them and they want to explore. I have 1 T.A, she spends all her time supporting these children to concentrate, if she is working with another group, then I must try and keep these children concentrating. I then have 5 children in my class who are ready to start writing sentences with support, they are able to form all of their letters correctly due to all the imput they have at home and are putting key points together (e.g. play my dog - when they actually want to say I played with my dog), they don't have the spaces yet and its not all is spelt correctly but they are ready for the next stage (2 have older siblings, the other 3 have very attentive parents). I then have a group of children who need a little bit of extra input and they will then be ready to start learning to write sentences- just need some extra practice with letters and organising thoughts. Finally I have a large group of children who need more input with letter writing and will not be ready to start writing sentences until January. The problem facing me is this: Do I start teaching basic sentences, knowing only those 5 will be able to do it, do I focus on the top 2 groups, giving them the extra imput that is needed to help those children start writing sentences, however leaving out the larger group. Or do I focus on the larger group, leaving those top 5 completely fed up and disengaged. Differentiation and ability groups in the class only goes so far, there is only so much time in the day/ session. However, by splitting children into ability groups instead of years means that they have the whole hour dedicated to that skill. The teacher is much more able to meet the needs and misconceptions as everyone is working at the same speed.

I don't expect everyone to agree on my view of constitutions. I believe most countries need a codified one, but Britain doesn't. Eire is an example of a created state, whereas the British state has evolved. As a result, Eire has needed a constitution to set out a legal framework. 

Reforming the British Constitution is remarkably simple- there's a vote in Parliament, and it either changes or it doesn't. The constitution is in large part just convention which no one goes against.

Not gonna lie, I was a bit disappointed when the biggest problem you give is that a Catholic can't be head of state. Of all the problems the British system has, that's one of the least important and relevant, not least because Catholics have had equal rights since 1829. My family is Protestant but none of them can become head of state, either. The head of state is a role that has insignificant power, and because of how much you're in the public eye with every single move being judged I don't know how many would want it.",0,1352576641,null,0,false,0,c6zctxj,t3_12xmks,t1_c6zctxj,t1_c6z9zgs,null,1430371037,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

If the teacher spilt them up by making both team captains from the teams then they would pick each other, insist on playing the position they played when they played in their team or hog the centre position, they would then just pass to each other and insist that everyone else pass to them the second they got the ball- again no point in playing.

I don't think that's a valid rhetorical tool, and it is exactly what the mail was doing in the article he was mocking.

And also, just because it's a joke doesn't mean it can't plant an idea in your mind.

It's like those documentaries Richard Dawkins does, where he can't call them ""Religion: the Root of All Evil"" so he calls them ""Religion: the Root of All Evil?"" The question mark means he is not stating it as a fact, it's just a question, so it makes it ok. There used to be a joke on Encyclopedia Dramatica saying that Dawkins' next book was to be called ""Your Mother: A Filthy Whore?"" - My point is that just because a technique, like humour, can be used for valid and true reasons, doesn't mean it can't also be used as yet another tool of baseless slander or to manipulate someone to your point of view.

The fact remains that the BNP still failed to win a seat, even though they fielded over 300 candidates in the last general election. I may have a ""lack of imagination"" but I'm just being realistic. You will always find racists, they're irrational people who will not be reasoned with.

true,Snazzles,null,null,"This! Everything I have learnt financially comes from my parents or my own research. The only time my school taught managing a budget was during my child development class (this was optional and only taken by 50 girls in the year) where we were asked to make a list of everything you would need if you were to have a baby (this had to include paying for electricity, gas and water). It turns out most 16 year olds have no idea how much stuff you need for a baby, the teacher gave us a list of basics with average prices. She set us homework where she said to us: you imagine are 3 months pregnant, you have 6 months to get everything on that list, you have Â£500 a month, Â£250 goes on rent and Â£100 goes on bills and food each month, we were not allowed to go into next months money but we were allowed to carry over any that was saved from the moth before, we were also allowed to find cheaper items but had to evidence it (so if we had found a cot on sale or in the classified ads we had to stick the ad into our budget project as proof). Trying to buy all the stuff needed was hard. At the end of the month- when the project was due in, many of us hadn't completely bought everything. 

It would have been a great lesson for PSHE and could have many twists- not just providing for children. 

In my school we have a reward system, where children's points earn't that week are converted into ""money"", with those points children can buy items- jazzy pencils, sharpeners, rubbers, rulers, key ring calculators, whistles, hula hoop time, scooter time, skipping rope time, bike time or golden playtime (basically half an hour on Friday afternoon playing in the playground with P.E equipment). Each item varies in price, pencils, sharpeners, rubbers and rulers are all 10 points, calculators and whistles are 20 points, play equipment time is 30 points and golden playtime requires 50 points. The items are priced to encourage children to save points. Most children earn between 5-15 points a week. Every Friday morning the bank comes out, I count everyone's points on a Thursday night  and put them in the bank, on Friday children have their bank balances read out to them. Children then decide if they want to withdraw their points to spend in the shop or to keep their points in the bank and save up for something bigger. Children may take out any amount of points, they do not have to take all of it out. It is very interesting, some children will choose to spend all their money every week and then complain that they never have golden playtime, despite having earnt at least 10 points every week and been reminded that you don't have to take all the money out . Then there are other children who will save all their points and have golden playtime every few weeks. There are also children who withdraw some of their points, buy themselves something small but save the other half of their points for golden playtime.

* Agreed that you shouldn't expect things to be any easier here, not at the moment anyway!

* Primark is dirt cheap, but also the larger Asda and Tesco stalls have cheap and decent quality clothing. As you might be in immediate need of a big winter coat, charity shops are a good place to look, too.

* Food: the cheapest supermarkets are Aldi and Lidl, with Morrisons and Asda the next rung up. Shopping around, though, is the better approach, especially if you have time to do so. Some things will be cheaper in a supermarket, others on a market stall, etc. Tinkering with your diet to make use of cheaper items is a good approach: for example, a big bag of raw chick peas will go very a long way, and can bulk out almost any meal, you just need to plan ahead to cook them in time!

* Games, no idea, but you might take a hit on eBay if your account looks dodgy, i.e. if it looks like you're both in Portugal and in England (what do people see when they look at your history, for instance?)  If a relative or friend is an established British eBayer, then maybe get them to sell things on your behalf.

* I agree, get out of London. OK for starters, while relying on friends, but they won't want you to get too comfortable, and *everything* (seriously) in London costs more than anywhere else.

If you're prepared to work any hours, and do any job, you'll find work. It'll be agency work, cleaning offices at the dead of night, and they'll take any chance they can to shit on your employment rights, but if you turn up on time and work the whole shift, they'll have you back.

We also do not say God bless Great Britain, or play the national anthem quite as often   (i believe we don't at the FA cup final, which is kind of like the UK soccer version of the Superbowl). We also would not dream of saying that Great Britain is 'the greatest country / number 1' Which an awful lot of Americans (in the media at least) seem to like to say. This is not necessarily because we think we are rubbish, we are just more reserved.

Furthermore, the myth of American exceptionalism is (in my experience) generally viewed with bewilderment and distaste by Brits. For example, Condoleezza Rice talked about American exceptionalism:

'A President Romney, I think, would understand American exceptionalism, would not be afraid to lead from in front, because the United States has to send strong signals to our friends and to our adversaries that we know where we think the international system ought to be going'

I do not think that a British Prime Minister would really talk about British exceptionalism, or suggest that Britain should be leading the world in any form. Most Brits (that I know at least) would think it incredibly arrogant for any country (especially ourselves) to think itself the international moral judge, that will act paternally towards other nations, invading those who are not moving in the direction that we 'ought to be going'.

We also tend to be more reserved when talking about ourselves personally; we are wary of appearing too arrogant by announcing our personal attributes/successes. In a way, you could say that this is rather confident, as if to say 'I know I'm successful, so I don't need to shout about it. And I can downplay my Bafta/ Knighthood /degree because we both know how awesome I am really, I just don't want to rub it in. ' This is perhaps why we are less comfortable with displays of incredible wealth in the UK (I think). 'Cribs' would not very British.


So this is perhaps why we don't have a national day.

&gt;""When appointed to the role, with 23 years' experience as a producer and leader at the BBC, I was confident the trustees had chosen the best candidate for the post, and the right person to tackle the challenges and opportunities ahead. However, the wholly exceptional events of the past few weeks have led me to conclude that the BBC should appoint a new leader.

&gt;""To have been the director-general of the BBC even for a short period, and in the most challenging of circumstances, has been a great honour.

&gt;""While there is understandable public concern over a number of issues well covered in the media â which I'm confident will be addressed by the review process â we must not lose sight of the fact that the BBC is full of people of the greatest talent and the highest integrity. That's what will continue to make it the finest broadcaster in the world.""

Managing your money - online banking, transfering money, understanding overdrafts, avoiding penalties

What is a standing order or direct debit? There are differences between them that people don't understand, yet we happily sign up for phone contracts by DD or set up a SE for paying rent etc.

How the fuck does a credit card work? What is AER? What does it mean and how does it work? Sometimes a small AER can mean huge repayments, or sometimes a huge AER can be a small repayment, all depending on what and how you borrow. I bet 99% of people don't understand this.

How do I get a mortgage? All the different schemes, deposit amounts, interest rates, repayments etc. 

How do I set up a business? Should I be self employed, ltd company, limited partnership etc.

What is in my employment contract?

How do I pay tax and what tax do I pay? 

Where does tax money go? (Like council tax, road fund tax, national insurance, VAT etc). People need to understand how government works and where our taxes go - see confusion over cyclists not paying road tax etc. 

How do I save money (i.e. premium bonds, ISAs, savings accounts etc)?

One of the big questions I hope this will answer is ""What happens if one of Rudy's extra selves dies""?

We can safely assume that if base Rudy is killed, or depowered, then every Rudy goes with him. What happens though, if self-doubt, or psycho Rudy gets killed? Are they gone for good? Do they just dematerialize or something and pop back out of Rudy whenever? 

If they do disappear forever do they take their personality with them? If self-doubt dies will Rudy lose all the self-doubt up to that point, or will he just have to learn to cope with it like a powerless person would.

The price of train travel in the UK is (can be) more expensive than driving or taking an aeroplane.

Unless you book WAY in advance or buy season tickets, an ad-hoc ticket bought just as you are leaving will easily cost you around $50 or more for a measly 1 hour train journey.

For the same money you can fly from, say, London to Berlin.

The market works most efficiently when there are many competing firms, and the idea is that the high barriers to entry for some areas of the energy industry (particularly distribution) make it natural for a few firms to dominate.

So there, he has told you that what the third of people surveyed said was *""yeah, ok, its ok to, you know, kill in order to defend your way of life""* - This is **NOT** what they said. He has re-worded what they said there in order to make it seem less offensive, reactionary and archaic, because that would better support his point.

And his entire point there was that the Mail re-worded the survey to make it seem as if that third had said "" it's acceptable to kill for islam"". This is **NOT** what the survey said either. What it said was ""**it is justifiable to kill in the name of religion, but only if that religions is under attack**""

Re-wording it either way makes it seem either more, or less, extreme and frightening. The daily mail played it up to be sensationalist, he played it down to make the Mail look ridiculous. Neither is the truth.

No matter how you cut it, he is playing the exact same trick the mail is playing with that data. The Mail did it to be sensationalist to sell newspapers, he did it to be sensationalist to make his little lecture better.

**First** of all, thanks for the nice words about the police. Often they do get a bad rep at these sorts of events, but I've found that at the right counterprotests they can be pretty good people. I'm glad they get shown up for doing a good job as well as when they are not so popular.

  
**Second** thing I notice though, is the group from Unite. It makes me really really sad when counterprotests are 'taken over' by groups from the unions and from the far left, and can really ostracise the large groups of more moderate people who feel just as strongly against extremism, but are maybe still not big on extreme groups on the other side of the spectrum.  
  
**Third** is related. I've not properly been to protests like this in a couple of years because of a number of groups I consider a bit distasteful.

Adebayor must be a sure starter - his performance against Maribor was superb and if he is fit he must play. He provides that extra link up play which is essential, and he rarely gives the ball away. Should partner Defoe nicely up top.

Bale and Lennon out wide - provided great width and both looked comfortable and it reflected so.

Centre midfield should be Sandro - usual defensive role and Huddlestone - although this is a bit of a question mark. We can all agree Sigurdsson isnt on the best of form and to start Carroll may be unwise in such a big game but who knows? I reckon Hudd could do a job, plus he would provide a mix of distribution and defensive ability.

Back four of Walker, Caulker, Dawson and Vertonghen. Dawson gave an assured performance midweek and should be rewarded, we know he's a good player. Definitely prefer him over Gallas. 

Keeper? Anyone's guess...

Absolutely no idea what the result will be. We beat United away and lose to Wigan at home - I think all predictions are futile. What I will say is that I think we are likely to score as clean sheets come at a premium for City this season, plus with a strong attack on our part. We will probably concede also.

Just want a good performance, playing to our strengths. City are a great team and I wouldnt begrudge them a victory if its deserved. We definitely have a chance of coming away with some points!

Then it makes a big deal of dividends being paid.  Tax is payable by the individual dividend recipients at a rate of c32.5% (unless they're companies).

Then it starts quoting operating profit as a proxy for Profit Before Tax, and makes a big deal of the company offsetting interest payments.  So are we saying that standard interest payments should not be tax deductible?  That hardly encourages entrepreneurship!

Also the article makes a deal of capital allowances, which are a perfectly reasonable way of a company again offsetting genuine costs of capital investment against taxable profits.  No avoidance going on there at all.

Now it actually has fish in it; not the millions of salmon last seen in the 1840s, but certainly fish are tastier than toxic sludge.  Someone has to pay for improvements like that.

And all of this for a few hundred quid a year?  If you ask me, that's an absolute bargain.  One of life's essentials provided at a tiny fraction of the average UK income.

We would need to get off gas and on to domestic renewables sooner than the current plan. More cost, unless you think you could nationalise shale gas and not breach current carbon reduction targets.

So if your target is reduce the retail price of energy I'm not sure nationalisation is the way. I'm probably biased as I remember what it was like the last time this tried.


If you want to keep the current set up but cap profits you run the risk of making the market less competitive. With reduced profits to gain fewer companies will be interested in the market. The margins on retail energy are not so huge (would you say they were more or less than Tesco's?)

At the University I attended the literature exams were 'seen' exams. 

What this means is that a student could choose which of the questions, lets say five questions, they wanted to answer and which books they wanted to use in answering the question. You had to answer a single question, of your choice, but in great detail.

Everybody loved doing these exams. **Each person I spoke to had a different set of novels. This told me that it wasn't about difficulty, but personal preference.** Each novel was either easier or harder for different people.

The same holds for GCSE. At 15/16 you have a good idea about what films, games, and books you like. A curriculum change I would make is to allow students the choice of genre to analyse. It doesn't make it any easier but it does increase enjoyment. Even if the type of literature you choose isn't amazing, it'll be a damn sight better than the other options available. 

As an example, if a place of education asked me to write an essay on the fantasy author George R.R Martin I would actively pursue writing such an essay. This is because I love reading his books. All students are capable of the same thing. I am a firm believer that there is a genre or form of literature for everybody. Novel, lyrics, poetry, short story. You name it, it's there.

Further comments:
Many people seem to have the idea that each level of face card has to be one person, such as the queens being Rose, or something. Each face card in a deck is different, so you could have 

* the kings: Hartnell, Baker, and Tennant for sure
* the queens: Rose, Ramona, Sarah Jane, and River
* the jacks: Jack Harkness, for sure... not sure about the others.
* jokers: there are usually two, so make one a Dalek and the other The Master or a Cyberman

I liked this episode, but saw Elyan dying as soon as the spirit told Merlin that one would not return. It's a trope you see a lot, with explicit characterisation before killing off that character so the audience experiences it as a greater loss.

And Gwen being brainwashed into trusting Morgana and hating everyone else was... surprisingly well done, IMO.

It works as a callback to the mandrake root that was used a season or two ago, and the whole situation of keeping her in that room while showing her kindness and concern reminded me a lot of Morgana trying to invoke Stockholm Syndrome instead of just magically brainwashing her - which I think she must have resorted to eventually, because even though Gwen was close to breaking, Morgana gave her up too easily.

Yes, it's an airtight clear plastic film to keep the tobacco fresh. It dries out over a few days, most people don't notice the difference but some do. 

As for the fancy stands made by the producers, many products do that. There were ones for 50 Shades of Grey a couple of months back. Where they to get kids to buy them? :-)

There is nothing in the kiosks that is targeted specifically to children nor is there anything used that's specific to tobacco. Brightly lit products in strong colours can be seen throughout the store. 

&gt; it isn't a trivial influence

In comparison to peer pressure and media portrayals of smokers, the presence of kiosks in supermarkets is very trivial. Smoking is attractive to kids that want to rebel and it is strongly tied to many cultural movements. Take goths for example, every single person I've known who could be considered to be into that sub-culture smoked at some point.

I still believe that we need stability and everything I hear and read suggests that he still has the full support of the players, however....

Something is wrong. I don't know what it is, whether it's players not interested, tactics not quite right, poor recruitment, I just don't know. We have now played a full season of away games without a win, that is unacceptable. We are over a quarter into the season and are without a win, that is unacceptable. 

Will a new manager change this? Again, I don't know. Yesterday appeared to our strongest team with current injuries and suspensions. We played some great football in the first half, much like against Spurs yet we concede another stupid goal from switching off and we can't put the ball in the net. Taarabt has been arguably our best player in recent weeks but should have almost scored a hattrick, confidence is definitely an issue at our club and I fear we're building too big a losing mentality.

As for change of managers, as I said before, I'm not 100% convinced we should, however the more we lose, the bigger the above mentioned losing mentality grows. Who else would we get?? Harry Redknapp? I'm not totally convinced by him, who else is available that could do a job? Rafa Benitez maybe? Honestly, who would take on this job now?

Personally, if we lose against Southampton then we're in dire, dire straits and that's when we start looking for change, as for what/who and if it will make a difference?

If anyone's watched him at West Ham this season, they'll have noticed what it takes to get the best out of Carroll, and it's the complete opposite of how we're setting up to play. Any sort of middle-ground compromise will mean we're not utilising Andy to the best of his ability, and we're not playing the style of football we brought Rodgers in to make us play.

At best, Andy would be a great plan B, and that could be a solution - **but Liverpool can't afford to have a striker on 80k/wk who is a plan B.** It's a waste of money; that 80k could bring us another Luis Suarez.

So that means the best solution for all parties is to sell Carroll, and in the long-term that is more important than having striker coverage for half of a season that is unlikely to provide a credible top four challenge. Our best bet of selling Carroll is West Ham, and that means we need him to become a vital player for them and for them to avoid relegation. Taking him back in January would go against both of those.

Lastly, we can't get him back before January, and by that point we won't need him again - Borini will be back, and we'll have signed at least one more striker/attacking player.",0,1352610887,null,0,false,0,c6zk8i9,t3_12zvg8,t1_c6zk8i9,t3_12zvg8,null,1430374585,13,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,13

**Print**: unashamed right-wing political agenda, political campaigning, UK focus.

There's less political ideology motivating the online version, except where it can be controversial/divisive enough to generate clicks and comments.  It's purely business. A very nasty business, no doubt, but there isn't the same agenda.

I suspect that most of the controversies are deliberate, eg putting inappropriate photo captions on minor-age celebrities, provoking outrage (=publicity, more clicks), they they edit the caption and start over with a different celebrity the next day.

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"in the intro 'no one doubts...' oh what a shock the notion that some people don't support poppy day is totally ignored, the very notion that a little emblem saying 'i support our troops' could be considered anything but a great thing is totally unutterable in public.   
  
I personally find it absolutely disgusting that we as a nation worship the armed services as hero's while significantly under respecting everyone that's actually working to make things better.  This whole poppy thing is simply a propaganda drive, it's an exercise in harmonizing group-think and little else more.  
  
Todays army is a choice and if less people choose to sign up then that might just limit our ability and desire to engage in wars of aggression, maybe we'll actual start take measures like diplomacy seriously.  If the army wants people to sign up then it's going to have to pay them a good wage and look after them in retirement; this is good enough for everyone else it's good enough for them.  
  
and you'll say 'but ww2!' and yes, maybe people don't really know much about the war so here's the band public service broudcasting reminding you;
  
[Dig For Victory](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whn8585iNxY) - due to the blockage in the oceans around England our nation was on the point of starving, vast tracts of the country and city were turned over to high yield agriculture to make end meet; and this food wasn't feasted upon but carefully packed up and sent to people who need it and forward to the front lines via complex networks of supply lines.  Without these people's work our people, our workers and our armies would have starved.  
  
[Spitfite](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_u4Md_aXVJE) a huge team of engineers and scientists dedicated every second of the life and every cycle of their brains on designing new tools and new devices; from the spitfire to the bouncing bomb and right through radar, sonar, and a thousand other things.  In the video you'll see factories full of women who'd put aside everything else to learn new engineering skills and to work themselves to exhaustion building these vital tools - and without things like the Spitfire our troops would be absolute sitting ducks, without these production lines it'd have been absolute certain death to anyone and everyone.  
  
[London can take it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu4Rr07bgVQ) and these people were constantly at threat, at brutal threat of bombs every night and the casualties and deaths were frequent, death was all too common in london.  Yet still these people picked themselves up and dusted themselves off, still they continue to work in the factories which were being bombed, and when one was bombed out they went somewheer else and learnt another vital skill - they didn't give up or surrender for if they had everything would be lost.  
  
[Waltz for George](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx41-XjGvuQ) and when these people could help they did despite the enemies guns, when our troops were caught up at Dunkirk everyone that could got themselves into a boat and made the crossing to fill their boat up with everyone they could, then they went back and got more - they did this all night under exceptionally heavy attack.  
  
This was a total war, a war in which everyone was involved; and what did this generation decided afterwards?  they decided it should be a new age, a world of fairness for all--this is why we have an NHS and all these vital institutions, so that everyone can be rewarded for the part they play in life; and they decided they didn't want more war, they wanted a world free from that kind of aggression and needless barbarity.  
  
We should be supporting the NHS and social security problems so every hero of that mighty struggle can survive, everyone that worked in that great war and everyone that works for peace after it; these people all deserve a full amount of respect, it's asinine and insulting to pretend only those that held a gun put themselves out.
  
and read some accounts of the wars, Mussolini and his part in my downfall by Spike Milligan for example; sure it was brutally hard but those terrible moments were inter-spaced between boredom, work and occasional revelry-- it seems absurd that someone repairing planes in a uniform should be respected more than someone building them in factory stripes.  
  
So if this is about ww2 then it's misjudged, if it's about how great war is in general than it's absurd and disgusting.  But no one has these opinions according to the media, no one could think anything but poppy day is wonderful; only a sick, sick person would think that and if you accidentally start thinking it then you should hide that from society least they make you a pariah and parade you through the streets.

They suspected it was a nest of snakes, who knows how many of them were out there. So Elyan told her to get to the trees. It was quite reasonable to get so far away.

&gt;Elyan fucking up the teamwork and going alone?

Everyone who went to the dark tower knew it was a trap, intended mainly for Arthur.  Elyan wanted to face the trap head on, to ""spring"" the trap so he would be the one who gets hurt. I dont think it was the right decision, there could have been more traps, and working together might have been his best option. But he was motivated by guilt, so he thought he should be the only one to suffer.

&gt;Elyan suddenly remembered he has a sister only to die later.

Yes, we didnt see many instances before that showed Elyans love for his siter. But thats hardly surprising. Most shows dont focus on a minor characters storyline unless something big is about to happen to them. For instance, he might have been angry when his sister was exiled, but decided to stay loyal to Camelot. He might have confronted Arthur, or thought about leaving with her, or said an emotional goodbye to her. But we didnt see these things or his inner struggle, because who cares about the inner struggle of a minor character.

But they have fucked this right up.

The two cases are *not* on a similar footing. There were editorial reasons not to air the Saville story - they couldn't make it stand up. It's bad luck for them that it blew up in their faces, and that ITV made it stand up instead. It looked bad that they didn't cancel the Saville Christmas tributes (very bad) - they should have, but the beeb is a massive organisation, they were two different depts, and there are structural firewalls built into the system to ensure that one dept does not interfere with another. I think that is an issue, because someone (head of Vision) should have brought the two teams together to discuss when the situation arose. But I see how it happened.

But the Welsh story is really REALLY bad. Newsnight did not name McAlpine, that much is true. But they did everything but. His name was circulating the web and being openly linked with the NN story. They will be sued, and the fact that they didn't name him will not be much defence. The problem is that they went with the story at all - it was untrue. At no point did NN journos check the victim's claim that McAlpine was the abuser. Considering the shaky ground the BBC and particularly NN was on after Saville, it is incomprehensible that they did not double, triple, quadruple check that this explosive story they were going with was watertight. No one put a photo of McAlpine in front of the victim. No one called McAlpine to put the allegations to him. This is basic fucking journalism and NN did not do their job. I watched NN the day this broke and there was naked anger from the host that this had happened - he clearly thought NN had fucked up and embarassed the beeb. I would not be surprised if this is the end of NN.

If you want to get her a jersey then get it as a random gift, not at an occasion where she is expecting something nice and instead you will give here a jersey which she may not even like. 

For example my girlfriend is a Chelsea fan and buys jerseys herself, she was a fan from her childhood because her father worked at the club. So gifting her memorabilia would make sense but if your girlfriend is interested in other things more than Chelsea then don't force it on her and give her a nice gift related to something she likes.

true,jihangir,null,null,"I think a lot of people, both news consumers and other journos, are very wary of any pro-establishment bias from the BBC.

While editorially independant from the government, the government sets the TV Licensing fee, and hence holds the purse-strings of the BBC's annual budget. This, in many people's opinion, makes the BBC more dependant on the State than is desireable for an international broadcaster. This problem is actually compounded by OFCOM. Giving the government more inteventionalist power over a media outlet, with the intention of preventing media outlets from being the victims of inteventionalist power, is a ridiculous notion. Who's watching OFCOM?

Coupled with the BBC's track record in this area, most notably the Dr David Kelly scandal, in which a BBC journalist, pressured by the State, leaked the identity of his source (the highest faux pas of journalism, and a dammning indictment of journalistic integrity that greatly eroded sources' trust in BBC journos) which subsequentially led to the death of a distinguished and talented UN weapons inspector (probably not killed by MI6, just suicide from the pressure of being outed) it's no wonder people are highly critical of the BBC's journalistic standards and integrity.

It sounds like I'm having a go, but we would all benefit from a freer UK press, and it's something I'm really passionate about. Press independance is probably one of the most important issues for a democracy, and with all our super-injunctions, world (in)famous libel and slander laws and recent free-speech arrests, the current trend is the reduction of the individuals right to criticise and speek freely.

Personally I think the BBC has enough support and goodwill amongst the public that they could survive as a charity, and the license fee could be abolished. This would remove the veiled threat of 'budget adjustments' by the incumbent party and allow the beeb to report more freely and more critically on political scandals such as the one we're in now.

As such, comparisons with BBC News are a bit tricky as each newspaper, news channel and magazine News Corp. owns is run separately, with almost no intermingling of journalistic resources. News Corp owns many News Organisations, but is not one itself.

BBC's broadcast news output reaches an audience of over 300 million people in over 200 countries worldwide, through domestic bulletins and current affairs programming across 6 national tv networks (two of which are dedicated to News &amp; current affairs), 1 regional TV Channel, 9 national radio networks, 6 Regional Radio networks, 40 Local Radio networks and 1 international radio network and 1 international TV news channel.

BBC produces 6 hours of broadcast news content per hour of the day across all its networks, has a staff of over 2000 professional journalists and has 41 news bureaux outside Britain. The BBC internet news service recorded a record 1 billion hits on 7/7/2005 and is currently the 5th most visited news site in the world.

I don't want to get into a lengthy discussion about this but I regard the crown estates as property of the state rather than the Winsor family so given that and the fact that there is no actual evidence of tourists coming here in significant numbers purely to visit active royal residences - I cannot see how the claim that they bring in more than they cost can be justified.

&gt;Reforming the British Constitution is remarkably simple- there's a vote in Parliament, and it either changes or it doesn't. The constitution is in large part just convention which no one goes against.

Except that's not true. There have been votes of the House of Commons in favour of an elected lords several times and yet it hasn't happened. Some reforms are regarded important enough for a referendum, but others aren't and there is no real consistency with that regard, unwritten conventions cannot clearly be changed, there is massive ambiguity in terms of who becomes PM given hung a Parliament... it goes on an on and on.

&gt;Not gonna lie, I was a bit disappointed when the biggest problem you give is that a Catholic can't be head of state.

As a Catholic from the West of Scotland this is the most obvious problem with the British Monarchy (other than objections to monarchy as a concept). That the head of state, a position that is meant to symbolise the nation, is specifically legally barred from being me or any of my family - or married to me or any of my family - yeah that is a big problem. The Catholic emancipation might have been in 1829, but a lot of discrimination is well within living memory.

Furthermore, yes being hereditary head of state is an awful job even if for no other reason than because there is a legitimate public interest in the details of your sex life. Prince Charles' affairs and alleged homosexuality are actually a matter of legitimate public inquiry because they affect who forms the line of succession.

true,istara,australia,Australia,"&gt; there will always be a small percentage of people who abuse any given system, and there is argument about whether that small amount of fraud outweighs the benefits

It's about ""theatre"".  These people are incredibly useful propaganda for the right wing to whip up public hostility to welfare.

As a result, left wingers need to acknowledge this minority and stop making excuses for them.

It's critical that there is a differentiation made between actual cheats and the genuinely deserving.

Endlessly arguing how minor or irrelevant the actual cheats are in the grand scheme of things is not an effective strategy to win support for welfare as a whole.  

&gt;the problem of having entire communities of people ""addicted"" to welfare, with multiple generations of the same families claiming because it's ""just how it's done"", which is indicative of a deeper problem

Again, the left wing needs to acknowledge that this problem has at least in part been caused by welfare.  It has become a way of life not just a safety net.  You don't fix the situation by removing welfare - that would simply hurt and deprive the most vulnerable (children).  But there does need to be more creative and constructive thinking about how it is doled out.

Free school meals are great, also free clothing for children, maybe even some kind of partial food stamps scheme.  Figure out how to cut the disposable income (spent on fags, booze, even flatscreens) for the multigenerational claimants while channelling *extra* money/resources, and educational incentives, directly to their children.  But in a way that the parents don't benefit personally by having more children.

I think the message needs to be: ""yes, you can have a child, and we will happily pay 100% for its health, food, education, even though you can't/won't, because we are a compassionate society and will not tolerate minors suffering, but you as the parent will not see an extra penny coming into your wallet as a result"".",0,1352631633,null,0,1352631980,0,c6zn3gy,t3_12yk58,t1_c6zn3gy,t1_c6zn0vq,null,1430376041,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The Guardian, over and above being left leaning, is a very media focussed paper; a brief look at their extensive [media jobs](http://jobs.guardian.co.uk/jobs/media/) section shows 1429 results, the [Telegraph equivalent](http://jobs.telegraph.co.uk/jobs/media-and-digital/) has 90!

b) The figures you've linked to show that spread is also a lot more even than the population as a whole. Not really surprising when you consider that many people and departments within the BBC will need to purchase a range of papers as part of their job - most members of the public just purchase one paper.  If you went out right now and purchased one of every national paper, that would involve a proportionately *far* higher comparative purchase rate for the Guardian and the Independent than the population as a whole - but it wouldn't make you biased!

c) If you consider the independent and the Guardian to be left leaning, and the Times, Telegraph, Express and Mail to be right leaning, that gives you a figure of 103,538 for left leaning papers and 170,828 for right leaning papers.  That's your evidence for massive political bias?!?  Complain all you like, you can't escape the fact by your own figures, by *far* most of the papers delivered to the BBC at the time of the last General Election supported the Conservatives!

d) Since when did we measure political beliefs by newspaper readership anyway?!?  For that to work you'd have to say, ""x newspaper leans politically in this direction, therefore its readers must lean politically in the same direction.""  That's palpably rubbish - the political views of the nation clearly aren't represented in its media consumption - people who read newspapers favour right leaning papers, but the clear majority of the electorate consistently vote for left-leaning political parties, directly against the advice of those papers.  If newspaper consumption revealed political beliefs, we'd have a permanent conservative majority.  It's not surprising: The population as a whole don't all read newspapers, and those that do don't necessarily read them for the politics - there's plenty of other content!  If you look at other groups e.g. online readership, you'll find it much more representative of political beliefs - but that still doesn't mean that's why they choose those papers.  It's really not surprising that people who work in the media read newspapers more, and more extensively, and therefore that their media consumption might well be more representative of their beliefs, although, as we've seen there is still a *right* leaning bias.

e) I hope you can see now that you're completely misusing statistics; a comparison with the population as a whole is not the same as evidence of political bias in and of itself!  Using a comparison between groups to make an absolute statement about individuals is a fallacy known as the [ecological fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_fallacy), I advise you to read up on it - it will hone your understanding of statistics and you'll soon see that your copy pasta is a perfect example of it; it's the same fallacy used by racists to make absolute statements about black people based on statistical comparisons.  You could literally pick *any* group of people and compare them with the population as a whole and it is inevitable the figures would be different!  That's not the same as being evidence of any individual causal properties, not least political bias, particularly in this case when most of the papers delivered to the BBC are biased towards the Tories!  People who work in the media consume media differently and for different reasons! Is that really evidence of *anything*?!?  

Your original statement was that the Newsnight investigation would not have happened with a senior Labour figure.  As has been explained to you, and you've completely failed to counter, the BBC's most controversial editorial choice was in direct opposition to a *sitting* Labour government and their policies of the day - far more politically damaging to Labour than this historical allegation would be to the Conservatives.  You've provided *no* evidence to back your claim up at all, other than saying that newspaper readership amongst the BBC is slightly less biased towards Conservative supporting papers than the general populace even though it's still biased to Conservative supporting papers... so the BBC must all be biased against the Conservatives!  Really?  Are you expecting this to convince *anyone*?!?  

TLDR; presenting correlation as causation and the ecological fallacy is no basis for an argument.


Also where on Earth did you get this phrase from 

&gt; ""humans just aren't wired to be capable of the objectivity you hope for."" ?!?

The usage of Rememberance poppies dates back to the 20's.

On the contrary, this donation is to support those who were left behind, the family of injured troops, injured troops themselves. 

Using one not for remembering a relative doesn't mean you're putting the Armed Forces in a pedestal, it only means you recognise the devastating effect field injuries can have in the troops' families in the aftermath. It's respect, not direct support to the Armed Forces. 

I'm a expat here in the UK, but I wear a poppy every year because I was curious the first time I've seen it and went on to research what was that all about.

true,misterjta,uk,Shropshire Lad,"It's a job title thing, it's about where the buck stops. *On paper* the DG is in charge of the entire operation, and as a result, he has oversight and responsibility for everything done on his watch. Yeah, he'll delegate authority and supervision downwards, but ultimately it's his job to monitor the situation and actions of his junior officers.

If you've got a massive international Megacorp, and Henry McNeoliberal is the company president, then ultimately, Henry's the guy who carries the can for the whole Megacorp family.


He delegates power down to the national-level Megacorp Presidents and CEOs, but *ultimately* he's responsible. That's what he's getting his billions of dollars and private company jet for. 


So, sure there are firewalls. If it turns out that Wallace, President of Megacorp (Australia) limited has been taking backhanders from corrupt contractors and falsifying the number of aboriginals working for him so he can skim the money off and fuck the workers over, it's Wallace's *fault*, but it's Henry's *responsibility*. 


...The difference is that the people at the top very rarely resign for fuckups. Hell, maybe Henry even *encouraged* Wallace, but if there's no paper trail, it's actually very unlikely Henry will step down and hand back the keys to the jet. He's much more likely to say ""I never knew what Wallace was doing, I am disgusted to find out, and I offer a heartfelt apology to all the widows and orphans we've created, I promise we'll take steps to ensure it does not happen again. No, really I didn't know - I got the email from Wallace saying he was going to do that, but I didn't *read* it! I'm a busy man, it's a total shock, etc., etc.""


The bizarre thing here isn't that the DG was expected to step down, it's that he *actually did*: in business, broadcasting or politics, it's incredibly rare for someone to stand down on principle (arguably, the last politician to do so in similar circumstances was Lord Carrington back in '82: he was Foreign Secretary and took responsiblity for departmental failures that meant we hadn't seen the invasion of the Falklands coming: although personally monitoring the military situation in the South Atlantic wasn't his job, he was officially in charge of synthesising all the data we had available, and he - not wholly surprisingly - failed to do so).

**tl;dr** 
He's expected to be involved just because he's at the top of the heap. It's not unique to the BBC, it's the function of every organisation: man in charge = man responsible. What's unusual is that Entwhistle actually took that responsibility, rather than ducking it. Good guy, it turns out.

true,KnownForNothing,lfc99,,"Hope he isn't out. But if he is, I really hope we don't play that formation. It looks good on paper, but I'm very afraid of our defence right there. 

It's obvious that Enrique and Johnson are going to have to cover a lot of ground since we don't have anyone on the left and right like we normally do. This will leave us very open in the case of a counter-attack, because Chelsea have a lot of pace with Torres, Hazard, Mata etc. and they are all capable of individual brilliance (through passes, beating their man, and all that). If Johnson and Enrique are too far in front, they may not be able to track back in time, and this leaves us with three at the back. And lets look at who we have in that situation.

Carragher: He doesn't have the pace any more. He still has his footballing intelligence, but his physical ability isn't there any more. Against West Brom, he was left for dead time and time again by Lukaku, who shrugged him off *easily* and charged ahead with speed that Carragher cannot match today.

Wisdom: I may have criticised him quite a bit lately, but he is rather solid when it comes to defending. However, he is prone to make some horrible mistakes at times which can lead to a goal very easily. With him playing slightly closer to the centre, it is even more important that he doesn't make any mistakes. Wisdom is also understandably inexperienced, which can be very dangerous for us. Against Everton, he was completely dominated by Mirallas in the first half. Against Mata (assuming he plays LW), he's going to have a tough time. Frankly, I'm still don't feel very safe.

Agger: We all know what Agger can do, so I won't elaborate. Perhaps the only person that I have confidence in when it comes to defending should we play this lineup.

It's pretty obvious we will be easily screwed over in a quick counter-attack. In the event of a slow buildup, I would say that we will still be in trouble.

Should Chelsea play a little bit of passing in our half, I'm still very afraid. This will allow the likes of Ashley Cole to get forward more, and Oscar and Ramires will have more of the ball in the central role, and they are both very dangerous players. 

Overall, I feel that without Skrtel, unless our defence pulls off something spectacular, we are going to concede. Chelsea are playing beautiful football with backheels, through passes and clever runs and this will completely screw us over at the back if we're playing Carragher (slow, compared to Chelsea players) and Wisdom (inexperienced).

true,Mr_Wolfgang_Beard,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;Yeah, it was also intentionally confrontational.

I have no problem with people being ""confrontational"" with the EDL. Passionate defiance of racist thugs is something I'll always support.

&gt;I'm not denouncing it just based on the police, I just want to know what they feel like they achieved today? Do they honestly think that it will have put the EDL off? I don't think so.

What did they achieve? As far as you can see not much: they were unlikely to change any EDL member's minds instantaneously, they didn't voice any new ideas or opinions, they didn't stand for anything that the vast majority didn't already stand for - it probably looks like a needless circlejerk to you. Except they did achieve one thing.  
They completely and utterly shat on the EDL's campaign. Everything that the EDL could have hoped to achieve by going out on a march in public was completely negated by the overwhelming support for a group created *just to oppose them*. Anyone who heard the EDL's opinion immediately heard 3 more opinions to counter it.  
They didn't achieve cery much as far as ""going forwards"" is concerned but they achieved a great deal in ""not going backwards"".

&gt;The fact remains that the BNP still failed to win a seat, even though they fielded over 300 candidates in the last general election. I may have a ""lack of imagination"" but I'm just being realistic. You will always find racists, they're irrational people who will not be reasoned with.

Yeah you will always find terrible evil people in this world. I'm sure if we tried we could find a fair number of people in the UK who still think women should be property, or that we should be allowed to enslave other people. There aren't enough of them to create their own political parties though! The fact remains that although the EDL and the BNP are outnumbered heavily and aren't even taken seriously by the majority, they are still real legitimate political movements withing the UK and they really shouldn't be.

And heavily regulated part privatized, or social insurance healthcare works very well in Europe. Germany and Holland have private insurers, France has private hospitals, all have copayments, and they are rated better or equal to the NHS. Britain has one of the most socialist systems in the world. Personally, I think our system works pretty well, and I'm reluctant to change it, but all of this rhetoric that the Tories are switching to an American system is incorrect.

&gt; Privatising the rail network worked out so well, didn't it... and now transport is one of this country's biggest problems (sadly mostly ignored by London-based politicians, who don't seem to have a fucking clue what things are like outside of the M25).

There's actually little difference between the cost per distance travelled for Britain, Germany and Sweden. I cited an academic study about it a couple of months back (I could dig it up, but I'd rather not!). Ticket prices have gone up, but that is mainly because the cost has been partially transferred from the taxpayer to the person taking the journey. Moreover, the best rail infrastructure is in the South East, so taxpayer subsidies mean that poor people in the North are contributing towards the costs for wealthy London commuters. The track and station infrastructure is not privatized, Network Rail is public, and infrastructure has seen decent investment.

You might feel that others are effectively applauding millions of people dying, which is obviously not a respectful action. However, others might believe that the dedication of the armed forces should be celebrated, for which applause would be appropriate.

That's right. However, we've got celebrities like Pixie Lott who in that news segment linked states ""There are people out there fighting for us *now*, the younger generation. And I think we should wear the poppy to say thank you to them for the sacrifice they make for our country"". This raises a reaction in me that says ""fuck off"". John Snow alludes to it, the fact that we have fetishised military service. Just signing up for the military automatically awards one 'hero status' it seems.   
Referring back to that Pixie Lott quote, I wonder if she could answer if questioned ""how?"". I wonder if anyone who regurgitates rhetoric like that could really explain how the troops are 'sacrificing for our country', how are they 'fighting for our freedom' or in fact who they are even fighting for that freedom? In fact, it seems if anything we have given up freedoms in the name of fighting a modern, faceless enemy. The British military serves the government, but not necessarily the people.       
This isn't 1940. There is no enemy at our gates ready to impose fascist rule on us by force. Active members of the military volunteered to do a difficult job, but there are plenty of other people who have dangerous jobs who get nothing like this adulation. At a quarter of a million people I'm not going to generalise about their motives, but I've known members of the military who find that ideology distasteful and don't consider themselves crusading heroes.   
You appear to have taken the time to actually research the meaning of the public gesture you choose to make. For that, *I applaud you*.  
But for most people, they just seem to be falling in line with the nationalism. Joining the choir, raising their voices in praise of war.

The problem I have with is remembrance for the soldiers of modern day. They were not made to join the army due to conscription, they joined out of their own will. They all knew that there was a high chance of death, yet they still decided to join. They effectively signed up to kill others in the name of 'Protecting the country.' We are calling these people heroes for killing other men and women. They were trained to kill. Now are these heroes or murderers? Killing those out of pride for a country. Some might say ""well they are just protecting our country."" What are they protecting our country from? How is going to Afganistan to kill, protecting? Surely wouldn't it be more logical to put them on the borders of our country?

It annoys me we have to 'respect' these people for killing others. They have not protected us from anything. They joined to kill. Why are we honoring those who are prepared to kill. Why are we celebrating those want to cause destruction and not those who want to make peace? 

Our country spends millions of pounds on destruction. What has this war proven? Nothing. The only thing it has proved is how much money we can waste trying to destroy an idea.  

There are No heroes, no shiny medals, no pretty uniforms or cool guys but dirt, blood, murder and death.

Why can't we strive to live in peace?                      ",0,1352641113,null,0,1352642352,0,c6znyby,t3_1307ke,t1_c6znyby,t3_1307ke,null,1430376416,21,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,21

One problem with that is during Labour's tenure they encouraged as many people as possible that they should all be at uni, which I believe is wrong. Not everyone has an academic mind, which is what university is for/about: further expanding your academic knowledge. That's one reason why I think that the tuition fees were put up, because of the massively expanding cost of such a level of subsidisation brought on by Labour's bollocks of everyone should go to uni.

Maybe you've forgotten that WMD's didn't exist? 

As for Afghanistan, the intentions were in part to wipe out extremism. But if anything military intervention made things worse for many, many years. The mere presence of British troops in Afghanistan was seen as war on Islam, and a war against ordinary Afghans. 

Even if the intentions were pure, the result was absolutely disastrous. There are many, many ways to quell extremism than to send in troops guns blazing. 

Not everyone who was against the wars are ""pacifists"". Similarly, most anti-war activists aren't pacifists. The majority of activists recognise that force and interventionism can be necessary in order to save lives, but the force used in Iraq and Afghanistan is questioned for good reason. 

Many lessons have been learnt though and military strategy is much different today than it was 5-10 years ago... but we still have to recognise the wrongs of the allied forces.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;yeah... but the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan made more people victims than were 'saved'.

No they didn't. The body count after intervention was much lower than during the Sadam years.

&gt;Maybe you've forgotten that WMD's didn't exist?

So? Either war wasn't just about WMDs and at before the insurgency, it looked like WMDs did exist or they were in the process of being acuqired and the regimes had the tenacity to use them. 

&gt;As for Afghanistan, the intentions were in part to wipe out extremism. But if anything military intervention made things worse for many, many years. The mere presence of British troops in Afghanistan was seen as war on Islam, and a war against ordinary Afghans.

That's because every attempt at emancipation is seen as a war on Islam. There was serious stockholm syndrome and a massive hatred for their liberators. There's no way that Afghanistan is worse off now than before the War.

&gt;Even if the intentions were pure, the result was absolutely disastrous. There are many, many ways to quell extremism than to send in troops guns blazing.

There's no way of negotiating with the Taliban or any of these failed state nutters -- look at Obama's ""peaceful negotiations"" with Iran and Syria. and they were the ones that declared war with their encouragement September attacks and it was ultimately a war against the state, not the people anyway. You can't win a war of that nature in any other way. 

&gt;Not everyone who was against the wars are ""pacifists"". Similarly, most anti-war activists aren't pacifists. The majority of activists recognise that force and interventionism can be necessary in order to save lives, but the force used in Iraq and Afghanistan is questioned for good reason.

Force and interventionism were used in Iraq and Afghanistan with factions and officials rebelling against the West.

&gt;Many lessons have been learnt though and military strategy is much different today than it was 5-10 years ago... but we still have to recognise the wrongs of the allied forces.

&gt;Bent double, like old beggars under sacks, 

&gt;Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, 

&gt;Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs 

&gt;And towards our distant rest began to trudge. 

&gt;Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots 

&gt;But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind; 

&gt;Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots

&gt;Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.

&gt;Gas! Gas! Quick, boys! â An ecstasy of fumbling, 

&gt;Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time; 

&gt;But someone still was yelling out and stumbling, 

&gt;And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime . . . 

&gt;Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light, 

&gt;As under a green sea, I saw him drowning. 

&gt;In all my dreams, before my helpless sight, 

&gt;He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. 

&gt;If in some smothering dreams you too could pace 

&gt;Behind the wagon that we flung him in, 

&gt;And watch the white eyes writhing in his face, 

&gt;His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin; 

&gt;If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood 

&gt;Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, 

&gt;Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud

&gt;Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues, 

&gt;My friend, you would not tell with such high zest

&gt;To children ardent for some desperate glory, 

&gt;The old Lie; Dulce et Decorum est 

&gt;Pro patria mori.

 *Wilfred Owen*

""Dulce et Decorum est, pro patria mori"" Translates to something like ""It is sweet and just to die for your country"". War is horrible, Owen knew it, all of the boys who got out of those trenches definitely did. It *is* important to remember those who fell fighting in these wars, however it is also important to remember how many of these men's lives were wasted in the trenches, how they had no choice but to fight, and maybe look at our own time and have a think about how we are wasting lives ourselves. I'm not trying to be self righteous, but I can't help but feel like Remembrance Day is something of a whitewash.

true,Lakey91,null,null,"&gt;between 1 April 2010 and 28 February 2011, the BBC bought 59,829 copies of the Guardian compared with 51,384 copies of the Times and 48,968 copies of the Daily Telegraph. The Daily Mail came in fourth (45,553) and the Financial Times was eighth (33,721).

So the paper the BBC reads the most out of the top 4 is the one that has the lowest circulation? Is that not disproportionate? Do they not advertise of all those newspapers only in the Guardian? Interestingly the numbers bought at the BBC in descending order are left wing to right wing. Is that not interesting?

One token former Tory does not balance make. I've seen a list of Nick Robinson's supposed biases; it's not very long. Certainly Paxman is not a conservative; he tried to take a balanced view on Empire, but then there are plenty of Liberals who understand the Empire wasn't all evil, just as there are plenty of conservatives who understand that Empire wasn't all good.

&gt;If you think it has a left wing bias, that's probably just because you have right wing opinions, and some degree of a disconnection with reality.

Reverse that and apply it to yourself. Can you be certain that your views are the objective, and mine the extreme?

true,Bear_Sheba,cnty-england,Alhamdulillah!,"Hello, pacifist anti-war ""establishment"" here. All conflicts are political in nature, as Clausewitz famously said ""War is the continuation of politics/policy by other means"". There are two reasons that I would consider myself to be a pacifist:

- I have a personal distaste for violence, and indeed it would always be an absolute last resort in my own life. I have been mugged a number of times, and each time I have gotten away unhurt (and with every penny) without either party having to resort to violence. This is a rule for my life, it cannot be imposed on others. I'm ok with that.

- From three years studying war as an academic discipline, the truth behind that Clausewitz quote really shines through. All of the conflicts that you have named above are political in nature, often the worst are examples of a politicisation of race. Bad politics makes war, and whilst I can certainly see the value in invading a country to end such a war (provided that you are invited), I have become sceptical that war can solve the underlying problems that lead to war.

Unlike others who might consider themselves pacifists, I don't tend to go around trumpeting my own horn, I don't suppose that I am superior to anyone else, and I believe that it is good practice to visualise alternative ways of thinking about a subject.

I still think this is a really important point so I can't leave it hanging there: let's distinguish between ""meaningless"" (I would argue that some jobs *are*) and ""valueless"". 

In the absence (thankfully) of some sort of horrible scenario where people are put to work on utterly futile activities, all work that's likely to be paid for, has value to somebody (the person or organisation who's willing to pay).

My point is that it can lose all meaning *to the person doing the work* because of the socio-economic situation that prevails. As a nice basic example: cleaning toilets. 

Cleaning toilets is necessary, it has value to society. It's generally regarded, understandably, as an unpleasant job. That it's regarded as somehow ""low"" on the social strata is a great pity - let's come back to that. 

Cleaning toilets *can be (and is) meaningful* to people doing it *if* they have some sort of vocational pride in what they're doing; if they're engaged with the system of which they're a part. For example, they may run their own cleaning company or are self-employed; toilet cleaning is one of a range of cleaning jobs they do, so there's variety and the work doesn't get too boring; they have co-workers they like working with, they don't have to work to arbitrary and inflexible routines; part of their job is ordering materials and organising other people. I realise I'm never going to paint this as rock star-level job satisfaction, but you can hopefully see what I mean.

The *same work* can be rendered *meaningless* to a worker if they're hired by some generic huge contracting company to whom they're *nothing*; the work is standardised, regimented and micro-managed; there's no room for initiative or engagement, no flexibility with working arrangements; no possibility for friendships or simple workplace banter because everything is run down to the wire in the name of efficiency, and the purpose of that efficiency is to make slightly more money for people the workers will never even meet. 

Another example, briefly: I've had fantastic meaningful work felling trees. Working for a small company, where they encourage you to take responsibility and make decisions, and look out for you when things go wrong, listen to suggestions to improve things. You work hard because that's the kind of industry it is, and you feel a responsibility not to let down the people you're working for, and with. 

I've also done very similar work (mercifully briefly) under a different regime where you're paid by the tonne that gets to roadside, at the lowest piece rate the boss can get away with. Both jobs are hard, physical work. In the latter you're head-down slogging all day, often in a shouting match with others who you think are slowing down your production. You may actually make slightly more money at the end of the week (depends...) but I would say that job was ""meaningless"" to me, in that all I wanted to do was get to the pub on Friday night without any broken limbs.

The headline is just one example of this.

Fair enough, if it wants to criticise the amount paid to Chief Executives compared to the average water bill, that's a valid point.  Comparing the amount paid to CEOs vs the amount of tax paid is not a valid point.

The anti-reddiquette downvoting in the thread goes to show how this sensationalism is effective in influencing views.

AVB was probably right to go defensive this time, the problem is after doing it in games where he didn't need to, people are going to question it. We were not getting enough possession to attack properly and players were getting pulled back towards our goal. Bringing on another attacker would have either just left us with another isolated player not really getting involved in 75% of the play, the other option is we adapt and push up more, giving City even more space to exploit which is ultimately where their first goal came from.

So it is okay for you tell me what do and think? People didn't die for me, and arguably they died so the US could go on to invade and kill people in all over the world.

If one wants to remember, then one can. The public events are about a public display of some sincere and some insincere mournfulness. Wearing a poppy is about showing others you are wearing a poppy, at least in part. At a higher level it's about collectivism and glorification of horrid wars that never should have been. Above any direct personal connection, it's about thinking ""we"" are the legitimate arbiters and enforcers of moral justice. It's part of a wider collectivist superiority, and who are supposedly the greatest evil collectivists of history? The Nazis and the Communists!

true,Toneh,null,null,"There is no doubt that visibility the key element to cycling safely, but wearing helmets and obeying the law to the letter are where I have my reservations. Regardless of what drivers think of cyclists, in an accident the cyclist is going to have a bad time; suggesting that an upset driver is more likely to cause an accident does not seem obvious to me. But if that where true, you could also plausibly argue that a cyclist with a helmet is less likely to die from a collision, therefore would be a more likely target of malicious behavior from a driver. 

Either way, there is something to be said about peoples perception of safety and how they behave because of it. Helmets will not save you from a 1 tonne metal car driving over your organically constructed body, even under 30mph. But the belief that it will, certainly does change behavior of the cyclist and surrounding traffic! Relativising the dangers on the road is not an intuitive thing. Most people are really quite irrational about these things. The first mistake for a cyclist to make is to trust anything human, every one of the motherfuckers could kill you. 

I don't want to ramble any more. But one note about the law. The ones that matter most like indicating, looking in rearview and side mirrors, opening doors onto the road, speeding, j walking without looking, are so much more important than any red light or pavement violation. From 3 years of daily commuting in London and my general distrust for people's concentration and competence I've learnt to ride in a style that leaves as little as possible to chance. Crossing an empty junction to get a rolling start on traffic is way safer thing to do than worry about other peoples traffic induced anger.

Of course there *are* victims who have contributed in some way to their own pain, but when people point this out we should look at their motivation. It's normally not to help victims, who are generally only too aware of the dangers they face. It's rather to avoid placing blame on someone else i.e. road designers, councils, drivers *as well* as bad cyclists.",0,1352652091,null,0,1352652572,0,c6zpqys,t3_1309d2,t1_c6zpqys,t1_c6zpkbm,null,1430377266,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

City dominated long stretches, had the lions share of possession, but couldn't really find that killer finish for the first hour or so. Agueros goal was nice build up with Yaya and he slotted it from almost the same spot he won the league from.

Dzekos goal was off a superb chip over the back line by Silva, stayed just onside, let it bounce and hammered it into the roof on the volley. It had been coming for awhile.

Spurs didn't really have much in the way of chances, especially from open play.

Zaba was a BEAST and got in Adebayors face after a dive. Silva was back to his usual almost, and believe it or not bringing on Maicon was absolutely the game-changer. He gave us speed and width on the right and Bale couldn't handle him. The 3-at-the-back tactical change worked as spectacularly today as it has failed in the past.

Why would you say that? 

Do you think that just because Reddit is the product of a capitalist system it could never exist in a non capitalist system? After all a capitalist system is just one thing. There are millions of systems one could imagine which are other than capitalist. 

Which non-capitalist systems have you thought about? Do you think any might have produced Reddit and the internet? Do you think some non capitalist systems might produce better stuff than Reddit, which after all is just a sinkhole for your time to fall in to? 

Some of us might do well going to a farm (I can't go back to one since I come from towns) and getting off Reddit but it has nothing to do with the social system we live in. 

Bearing in mind some humans' capacity for complex thought and imagination, we could come up with loads of cool stuff just because it's cool. Actually, that's how a lot of cool stuff comes about before the profit people get involved. 

Doncha know. 

EDIT: Maybe Reddit is one of those very things, constructed by some geeks in their bedroom because it looked like a fun thing to do...? 

Imagine we could come up with a concept that eliminated profit and people could spend lots of timing thinking about what kind of cool stuff they could get up to and invent if they didn't have to worry about generating enough surplus out of it to pay for some rich people's yachts and extra homes.

You are right. I have a genuine dislike of the EDL,I'm not too worried about expressing those feelings. But I totally understand your comment though, and I think your right.

that said....

1 - I genuinely didn't go too far out of my way to belittle them past what they did themselves to be honest. Truth be told, I posted the best shots I took. A lot of that came down to whats in focus as much as anything else. But...the comments/titles obviously went too far form a journalistic point of view, but then again im not a journalist. I suppose ultimately it comes down to the side I support, and although these are photos that record the day, they are also photos that record my thoughts and feelings on the matter.

2 - Iv stated in another post that I though a good 70% of the edl lot where fine - well behaved, protesting in a polite, very loud way. Nothing too dissimilar from the ""We are Norwich"" bunch looking at it subjectively. But...there is a good 30% who are every bit as bad as you would expect/have heard. And unfortunately/fortunately, those kinds of people make for more interesting images.

3 - As for the guy shouting abuse at the EDL...I agree with you...mostly. While I think its a stupid thing to do, its still essentially a passive statement that any sane person would just ignore. The fact the a small amount of the EDL (part of the 30%) literally wanted to tear him apart says more about them than it does the guy shouting abuse.",0,1352653601,null,0,false,0,c6zq3ms,t3_12yx7i,t1_c6zq3ms,t1_c6zn19h,null,1430377431,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

It's never acceptable to kill, but, sometimes it's required. I don't think we should be honouring people who don't fill that criteria. 

WW1 &amp; 2 soldiers were required to kill. Not only were they conscripted but when they were in those trenches if they *didn't* kill they would have been killed themselves and faced the very real danger of having their country and home overran, having their family killed, etc. 

Modern Soliders, not so much. I think it's easy to fall into the bad logic of *""Signed up to kill*"", I don't believe they do, I don't believe soldiers are blood thirsty. However you have accept it as a possibility, it's part of the profession, there isn't anyone who doesn't know this and in spite of that people *still* go ahead and sign up. I find it hard to respect those people, I find it hard to accept that putting yourself into 'kill or be killed' situations justifies the choices that put you there.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"Do we have any clarification on whether Pearce's suspension is one game or three games? A straight red card isn't always an automatic three-game ban, which makes it quite confusing.

Anyway, we're going to be in trouble for the Millwall game - and it'll only get worse from here. To start with, our next two home games are against Crystal Palace and Leicester City. Fun times.

We're running out of time to do anything in the loan market, so with the takeover not happening anytime soon, I would spend whatever resources we have left, if I were Warnock. If he isn't able to sort something out then he might not even make it to the transfer window! Cameron Jerome and Alejandro Faurlin on loan would be utterly fantastic.

However, like a true Leeds fan, I'm going to assume that nothing positive will happen. As such, here's the direction I would take the team in against Millwall:

* We tried to play with the ball on the deck for once against Watford - mostly due to the nature of the 3-5-2 formation - which I really enjoyed seeing, but with us going away to Millwall on Sunday, there's no chance that we'll be able to do that at the New Den. Warnock would be wise to take us in a 'back to basics' approach, even if it means the return of the dreaded 'hoofball'.

* This means 4-4-2 - or 4-4-1-1 depending on how Diouf plays. I'm almost tempted to suggest Hall up front and Diouf on the wing, because having a pacey strike partner up there with Becchio would be fantastic, but Diouf won't work enough on the wing against Millwall and Hall is our only winger. After an absolutely shocking performance in which he completely looked devoid of confidence, White **has** to be dropped.

* So, I'm thinking Kenny in goal and a back four from right-to-left of Byram, Lees, Peltier, Drury. I don't think that Drury was even on the bench against Watford, so I'm afraid that it might be Pugh in his stead. As for the midfield, I'm thinking Hall in the right and Tonge on the left with a midfield duo of Norris and Green (bear in mind that Brown is suspended for this game, having picked up five yellow cards). Alternatively, Hall can move onto the left with Green on the right wing - or Byram can play on the right with Green in defence. However, I would opt for Green in the middle instead of Tonge, as he offers much more mobility and a higher work rate.

* As before, Diouf and Becchio ought to play up front. The important thing about playing Millwall is that we don't get bullied all game and I think that it's important to have a strong target man up front - assuming that he stays on his feet. Moreover, it's important to use Becchio because he scores **goals**. I really do admire Varney's movement up front - and I also like that he can competitively challenge for headers - but he just hasn't been scoring goals.

* However, one key thing that I would do differently from Warnock, is go into games with a clear plan regarding how to use substitutions in order to positively change a game. Now, in fairness, I imagine that he will have given some thought to this, but the majority of his substitutes have been made in response to conceding a goal; not when it's clear that we'll concede unless something is changed. Sadly, the one time he did make a change like this, we lost 6-1! As an example of what I see, in the above line-up that I've mentioned, I'd like to see a thought process reflected in his use of substitutions along the lines of: ""Right, if we're still in the game by the 60 minute mark but we're not looking like scoring, then I'll take Diouf off and play Varney on the wing, with Hall and Becchio up front.""

In truth, there's not a great deal we can do to change the situation we're in. The 6-1 defeat was a freak result because of the circumstances, but we were due a heavy defeat like that after surviving games against the likes of Barnsley, Brighton and Sheffield Wednesday, in which we could have easily conceded six goals with 11 men on the pitch! Right now, I think that it's important to try taking the game to the other team and getting our attack-minded players in form, because the vast majority of Championship clubs have piss poor defences: that's what we need to focus on.",0,1352654722,null,0,false,0,c6zqd7u,t3_13093z,t1_c6zqd7u,t3_13093z,null,1430377561,2,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,2

true,BritishImgurian,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"**MOTM -  Oscar.** I was really surprised he was subbed off because I thought he was really challenging Liverpool and really opening up the game. Moving the ball around, taking the ball past players and really offering a lot to the game.

**Torres manned the f#ck up.** This was the first time I can honestly say Torres was an asset the entire game. He put so much more effort into this game than every other game combined. He came out with the attitude of a champ and even though he died down towards the end of the first half, he came back out of the tunnel and put the effort in again. If he can play every game like he did today, or at least somewhere similar, we may have an actual striker for opposition to fear. I honestly don't know why he was taken off, and it looked like he didn't either.

**England's Brave John Terry.** Captain. Leader. Legend. He comes back from a ban and leads straight from the front. This man is literally the definition of a World-Class Captain. Such a shame he had to go the way he did, but there were promising signs that it wasn't as bad is it first looked (stay tuned).

**Mikel is looking like a boss in the middle.** He has really come along this season. He has become a wall in the midfield and is really strengthening our defence. A lot of people seemed to be bitching about him at the start of the season but I truly believe he has shut them all up. He's also getting dangerously close to his first ever PL goal!

**Mata is getting sloppy.** The magician was having flashes of brilliance, but his last action of every move just seemed to be sloppy. Passes, shots, crosses. They just seemed to be going off. I don't know if he is still feeling the fatigue still, but he could do with sharpening up.

**Cech was needed twice today.** Thankfully he stood up and sat Suarez down when he was really needed and made a great last minute save, but our defence and midfield were hard as a rock. Obviously I know Cech did make *some* saves, but this has been one of our strongest games defensively of the season. Such a shame about the goal conceded, because other than that I though we were pretty solid.

**Y U NO MARIN?!** It's good to see Moses, Dave and Berty getting time, but why not Marin? He can't still be injured, surely? He looked so promising in the pre-season and I think he can offer the energy needed towards the end.

**We made a mountain out of molehill.** That game should not have been that difficult. As soon as we conceded we were Route 1 and kick-and-hope. We have creativity to die for, but with the lack of finishing we just aren't winning the easier games and we are going to pay for it.

**KTBFFH**

That's utter bollocks. Watts contacted Kelly to find out if she'd missed a story - had she 'missed a trick'. She concluded that she hadn't - that there was no story. That's why she refused to support Gilligan before Hutton - even going to the lengths of hiring her own legal counsel, to resist the pressure the BBC put her under. Read the transcript of her evidence. Read the transcript of her conversation with Kelly. Watts evidence was damning for BBC's position.

&gt; The 45 minute claim was dubiously sourced, actually incorrect, and subsequently duly mispresented to the press ('45 Minutes from Doom!!'). 

The original intel said '20-45 mins'. JIC (*not* the goverment) simplified it. Hardly a misrepresentation. The source turned out to be dubious - but that's in the nature of spookery, in a paranoid society like Saddam's Iraq. There isn't any evidence that anyone in the intel game ever doubted it. Just because ""45 minutes"" has been repeated, as a joke, a thousand times since, doesn't mean anyone laughed *at the time*.  Pre=war, there wasn't a single article, in press or tv,  questionning this item.

&gt;leaked his name to the press.

An assertion without a scintilla of evidence. However, Gilligan *definately* leaked his name to the FAC.

&gt;The government then called him for a very public and humiliating dress-down,

More bollocks. All meetings with Kelly were private, and there is no evidence of a 'dressing down'. At the time of his death, Kelly was still slated to return to Iraq.

If Kelly had anyone to worry about, it was the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, whom he had misled (and he knew that elements within the Beeb knew he had done so).

Liverpool MOTM: Jones with Jose Enrique closely behind.

Hear me out on Enrique. Yes, he has been dreadful these past few games but this guy put his 120% today, and it showed. He trailed back after EVERY ball and won it. Yes, he wasted balls, but he wasted them going forward instead of going for the secure pass to the back. I think we saw a little glimpse of his old form from last season. I can't wait for him to be 100% every match. He needs to pass it a bit more. He tried to do a little too much by himself trying to take it down the left by dribbling. Needs to learn how to trust his teammates and do a wall.


And Jones? Fucking superb. To be honest, I'd be ok with Jones taking over Reina.

That for me was the only period in the game where we had true control and fluidity in our game, aside from few missed opportunities sprinkled throughout the game. 

Mikel - Seems that every game we get to see a little bit more of an improved Mikel. As BritishImgurian said, I'm pretty sure one of these days he's actually going to score. He's a defensive presence that is really felt in the middle. 

Cech - Best Goalkeeper in the world IMHO. 

Torres - Shouldn't have been subbed off. Why are we so afraid to play with two attacking options up top? Arsenal seem to do it, City, United, the list goes on. Chelsea have the capability of being deadly upfront with what we have. I personally don't think its being utilized at its utmost. 

Marin - We really need to play this guy already.

Mata - great performance again, a bit sloppy, I think he should have passed to Hazard ready than to take that shot, but if he was shooting, at least try to hit the target. Can't complain too much about him though. 

Cahill - Future Terry? He came on and straight away was in the game mindset and *trying* to control the flow of play from the back. 

Bertrand - He's great, but not quite there yet. Soon my friends, very soon.

All in all, we really should have gotten three points against Liverpool scum, but alas it is what it is. We are still very much in this title race, don't forget how quickly things in the premier league can change. If I recall correctly United gave up an 8 point lead off the top of the table to City last year, so anything can happen.

It was nice to see Carra out there and playing well.  Something about Chelsea brings the best out of him...

Enrique's return to form is a good sign.  We need to find goals from more sources and being able to play Johnson on the right gives us more of  threat on that side.  Suso isn't a goal threat right now and Wisdom doesn't get forward so shifting Johnson over there may balance our attack.  If we can get our first choice back four together with Lucas in front, maybe our midfielders can be let loose to join the attack more often.

I thought Stevie was better today but Allen had probably his worst game of the season and Sahin continues to be pretty anonymous.  Stevie doesn't look like much of a goal threat any more so we need more from Sahin.  I've been hoping we could get him for a while now but he's been disappointing.

But you certainly will enjoy it, the weather could be really good in May too so that'll be a definate plus. I'd check out the places below if you can..
-Red Light District. An obvious one, but there's loads there, aside from an awful lot of ropey prozzies. The sex museum is pretty fun, and the peep show is a good laugh. Just stay out of the wanking booths haha.
-Coffee Shops. Again an obvious choice. If you have no intention of having a smoke whilst your there, ignore this. If you are, then take it from me that it is STRONG. Don't buy pre-rolled joints, they're rough. Buy something weak and roll your own. The number of times I've been monged out not wanting to leave the coffee shop is embarrassing.
-The Rembrandt Museum is great, so is the Van Gogh if you want to soak up some art.
-The parks in the city are beautiful, The Vondelpark is enormous, there's pretty lakes and plenty of places to sit.
-It's already been mentioned, but hire bikes. So much fun, the locals won't thank you for being a bit of a fart when it comes to the etiquette, but you'll soon get the hang of  it. A lot of the bikes require you to pedal backwards to brake, so look out for that.
-If you're looking to camp on your trip, Camp Zeeburg is absolutely wicked. A pretty boho place with a good atmosphere, great shower and toilet blocks, nice cafe and restaurant, and only ten minutes bike ride from the centre.

Hope that's helpful. Let us all in /r/Wales know how you get on. I'm from Builth Wells by the way.

Nobody from Liverpool or Chelsea scored high today, but there were some solid performances from Enrique, Johnson, Suarez and Sahin.

My only gripe with BR is that Sahin shouldn't be taken off, but he may know something about match fitness that I don't. I thought the 60 minute change should be Suso on for Wisdom (back to a flat 4 at the back) and Sahin pushed a little forward with Allen infront of Agger and Carragher. 

You need someone of Sahin's experience in the final 15 minutes of tough games. You can't expect young players to always score goals in these situations, or to create them. Sahin needs to be given a full 90 and license to roam forward. HE did this to excellent effect at Dortmund and saved them/won them a lot of points in the process.

The fact that we only made a single substitution in a game that was held 3 days after a trip to Russia tells you everything you need to know about the depth of our squad and what BR thinks of the players he had on the bench today.

The land which is known as the Crown Estates is not owned by the Royal Family.  The House of Windsor never have owned the land in question.  If the monarchy ended the land management would simply be transferred to a part of Government and certainly would not be held by the Windsors.

I doubt that members of the Royal family are more effective diplomats than the professionals who are officially in this role.  Prince Philip and even more notably Prince Andrew have repeatedly shown themselves to be a hindrance to diplomacy.

I do not think the Royal Family boost tourism in any meaningful way, very few people would visit Britain because they have seen the Queen.  Hardly any get to see the Queen when visit here and nearly always that is not why they come.

true,cech_mate,present,Didier Drogba is a Legend,"&gt;We need a player alongside a DM that can set up play from deep, who can pass the ball well and connect our defense and attack. That player is Oscar.

Mikel is the DM. We have Oscar, Hazard, and Mata. We dont expect them to drop back that often. that the reason we're using two pivot players. Mikel and Ramires. Their job is to be the first line of defense and give the 4 defenders cover, track runs and fill in gaps. which since the two been playing they have done exceptionally. There haven't been much build up plays that lead to goal against us this season. And today as you can see liverpool was limited in the middle United, Arsenal and a whole lots of other team. I will admit Mikel need to be fast in releasing the ball to the **Holy Trinity**. It's not his job to create those defense splitting passes to the striker. The last two game you have seen Ramires play more defensively while Mikel has been more adventurous , I think he finally want to end his barren spell. [Stats](http://i.imgur.com/ZHYQl.png). Your assessment of him is a bit critical, We don't need a creative player to play the pivot role. We need two defensive minded players (Mikel and Ramires) at the current moment the only problem with the team is our inability to bury the game early.

Anyways yes, get into the classics there amazing!
My advice ignore docs 1-2 right now.  The black and white combined with the missing episodes  factor will just be to different for you now.

Just start with the beginning of 3, spearhead in space and watch in order from there.
(you will get a little black and white to start but it will go full color soon enough.)
Third doctor era is where the show modernized a great deal, plus if you like the master you will be very happy.

Once you get through 3-7 double back to 1-2 if your still interested.
But don't jump around!!
There are arching plots and character progression here just like new series, you will lose so much not going in order",0,1352663017,null,0,false,0,c6zsi4d,t3_130bqk,t1_c6zsi4d,t3_130bqk,null,1430378557,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1
