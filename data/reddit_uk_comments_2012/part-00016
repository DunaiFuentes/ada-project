Some do, of course, or say that they do: The schmucks at the Christian Legal Centre for one, and the Christian Institute (amongst other things), but the average Christian in the street ([although, I'm not sure I can say that as Christians appear to be in the minority now](http://www.natcen.ac.uk/study/british-social-attitudes-26th-report)) I don't think feels persecuted. Rather, they are *told* they are. Consider several front pages today:

The Times: *""Christianity on rack after public prayer ban""*      
The Telegraph: *""George Carey: Christians have rights too""*    
The Daily Fail: *""Christianity under attack: Anger as major court rulings go against British worshippers""*   

Add to that the utterings of muppets like Carey here, it's not really a surprise that some people might believe that they're being marginalised. It's apparently endemic - just this week the [Bishop of Bristol effectively lied to the General Synod](http://www.secularism.org.uk/news/2012/02/bishops-lie-about-nss-chaplaincy-campaign-at-the-general-synod) with regard to the NSS's concerns over hospital chaplains. I doubt very much that he doesn't know what the NSS are after: They've said time and again that they do not wish to see chaplains removed, but rather they want chaplains paid for by someone other than the taxpayer. But the Bishop said ""Every effort ought to be made, and is being made, to resist secularist calls for chaplains to be excluded from the NHS.""

And let's not even begin to comment on the bullshit the pope says about both secularists and atheists.

With a hierarchy hell bent on misrepresenting their opposition, it's little wonder that many people are confused about secularism and secularists.

Amusingly, that was the alternative the judge concluded should take place.

Well if that had have happened, I can still see someone having a problem with it, assuming that business stopped while the Christians prayed. Such a thing has no business in the council chamber and it could be seen as an effort to force your religion on other people. I have to say you're less cynical than I, as I very much doubt it would be worded in such a way!

true,AndorianBlues,k9,K-9,"I think.. it's actually almost exactly like what really happens: there is a new Doctor, who is a truely new person, but who has memories of experiencing previous adventures. Very much like how the Doctor is now played by a new actor, who has (theoretically) seen all the previous episodes.

So, the Tenth Doctor is gone, and now there's the Eleventh Doctor. He remembers Tennant's adventures, but maybe ""from the outside"", ie, he has no easy, direct access to the previous Doctor's personal experiences. He remembers it like we do, 'episodes' from a previous Doctors. 

Although, there are moments where this barrier between Doctors appears broken. Shortly after regeneration, the Doctor tends to lapse into previous identities. The Fifth Doctor did this when he was 'born', and so did Ganger Doctor. 

Tennant's was the only really emotional regeneration we've had. It was a fitting end to the RTD era, I think. 

The Second Doctor's forced regeneration is probably one of the most significant ones. In the whole epic War Games story, he slowly seems to lose grip over the situation, and it really feels like he's failing on all fronts. He can't rescue the humans, his companions don't trust his judgements any more and and he's ultimately forced to admit defeat and call for help. Six seasons of Doctor Who ending with his own people dismissing him as nothing more than a irresponsible meddler.

Mourinho-If Real Madrid gets rid of him it is very possible he could make his way back to the bridge, Good thing about him is that he has worked with many of the players on the field and would not stand for poor performances like the ones we've seen from Bosingwa lately. Negatives, he could potentially make the small division between the Iberian players and the English players larger. As a side note, Mourinho would have the potential to bring some players from Real Madrid especially the foreign ones.

Gus Hiddink- Now that he isn't doing anything he would be almost perfect at Stamford Bridge he has a long history of being able to keep attitudes in check (Lampard) and can get the Blues to play a more fluid passing game. The downsides of having Hiddink, his age mainly and the fact that he hasn't managed club football in a few years now.

Fabio Capello-This is a big long shot but with the money CFC has it isn't out of the realm of possibility. Capello did some interesting things with the English team and with the resources at his disposal he could re invent the midfield and forwards.

true,NervousEnergy,eng-yorkshire,Welshman in Yorkshire,"I lived in good old Yarmouth for three years. My personal opinion? Its unfortunately a shithole: full of chavs and unemployment. In the summer it takes off with tacky tourists. The seafront (the Golden Mile) is full of awful tourist attractions and arcades and such. Most are closed during the off-season, so the town is practically dead in winter.

However Norfolk can be lovely. And with a car you've got a great opportunity to visit The Broads which are still pretty nice in winter.

Sheringham, Cromer, Wells-next-the-Sea, North Walsham, Aylsham: are all absolutely gorgeous old English type towns within an hours drive of Yarmouth. Plenty of rural pubs serving great beer. 

The town of Wroxham is rather unique in that the entire town-centre is owned by a single company: Roys of Wroxham. It's an experience. 

I particularly recommend Winterton-on-Sea beach. It's lovely. Might be a bit windswept at this time of year though.

Norwich is only a 20 minute train ride from Yarmouth and its probably my second favourite city in the UK. Gorgeous city, a must if you like history and eclectic shops.

The Mata sub was weird, he was going for more directness and Mata was having trouble getting into this game. But its not what lost the game. We lost the game when we stepped on thhe pitch. We gave 1/50th of the intensity that we give in the big games.

The easiest thing to do is blame one person but the problems are really a collective issue thats been going on for about two years.

Lets look at the team right now. How many players are playing at the level of Champions league footballers? Let's take a look at guys who played today

GK: 

Cech uncontested. Is having one of his worst seasons in many years. Didn't look outstanding today and gave the ball right to the opposition fifa style.

Midfield. We had 4 midfielders available today: Lamps, Meireles, Mikel, Essien

Lampard - barely got out of a jog today. Has played 4 good games all season. I love Super Frankie but he's no better than your average premier league midfielder this season. 

Meireles - Another average midfielder. Not a great passer. Was supposed to be cover this season. AVB uses him too much but what other choice has he had?

Essien - was good today but can't run the entire midfield by himself

Forwards
- Wingers: We have none...except malouda...so basically we have none
- Strikers: A guy who has scored 2 league goals all season. Has Torres had a shot in the last two games?

An 18 yr old

And Sturridge who has to play on the wing because WE DONT HAVE ANY WINGERS. Has been good but inconsistent this season. 

Playmakers: Juan Mata. The saving grace of the team. Also has to be played out of position because WE DONT HAVE ANY WINGERS. 

We have a decent squad. We don't have a strong squad. We don't have half the depth as even Tottenham. At a team like Man U or Man City even their best players can have an off day because they have squad players who can fill in.

And Yes there is a lot that goes on behind the scenes where AVB could be at fault. I don't know what hes doing on the training ground. I don't know how he deals with management. I know that he should be doing better. But I also know that this problem is far beyond AVB. We have done a poor job at restructuring the team and the administrations attitude toward youth development has hurt us. Look at INter right now. They won the CL a few years ago. They are fifth in Serie A. They had an old midfield and didn't adequately rebuild the team

There're theories floating around to the effect that regenerating often causes the next incarnation to take on a lot of the ""baggage"" weighing down the Doctor at the time of regeneration, or that his mood or disposition, even his general mindset will have a major influence on the overall personality of the next incarnation.  
  
The Doctor can't control which aspects of his current self will carry over.  There's always the chance things will go sideways and only the most negative aspects will emerge after regeneration (see the Sixth Doctor for an example of this).  
  
In this light, it's easy to see why Ten might be afraid of what he might become.  I think he was starting to realize how dangerous and self-important he was starting to get with the whole ""Time Lord Victorious"" / ""Lonely God"" arc, and he genuinely feared that a regeneration might sear away everything good left in him.

true,chochazel,null,null,"&gt;You were the one who declared that 'Until parties supporting independence get a majority, there's no reason to have a referendum', without backing that position up at all.

What are you talking about?  I gave plenty of reasons, not least that it's the way that all other democratic decisions are determined!  The burden of proof is on you.  You're the one who wants referenda triggered by polls!

&gt;And yet I'm the one who is guilty of not backing up my statements?

Yes!

&gt;You're the one who decided that Someone is wrong on the Internet!

And you were the one who claimed that Britain refused to give Scotland a referendum at a time when it was notable that this is exactly what has just happened!

&gt;Everyone seems to agree that when a referndum[sic] is held on an issue, another shouldn't be held for a reasonable period of time.

Argument ad populum!  Everyone also seems to agree that referendums shouldn't be triggered by 40% in an opinion poll, but I didn't consider that a worthwhile point!  Once you've established that as the proper measure of whether we have self-determination, you can't pick and choose when you apply it.  There may be all sorts of policies and variation of policies which can get high opinion poll ratings, depending on how the question is asked.

&gt;Strawman again. I don't think election results should be ignored, I think that they are not the only factor that should be considered.

Considered by whom though?  If the answer to that is anyone other than elected representatives, who are only there because of those election results, what kind of system are you proposing.  That is how our democracy works.  So ultimately, it is the only factor.

&gt;False dichotomy. Referenda are not triggered by some single statistical measure and I find the idea that they should be ridiculous. The decision to hold a referendum is taken by the politicians in power, based on their judgement and assesment of all the facts, and in an ideal world on principles of fairness and the interest of the people.

Of course those decisions are taken by the people in power!  And their opinions will vary.  If you're going to call them hypocrites who don't apply the same principle of self determination to the Scottish as they do to the Falkland Islanders, simply because they didn't agree to a referendum for Scottish Independence even though you found a Newspaper poll putting it at 40%, sorry you *are* implying that newspaper polls should be a triggering point.  You are the one removing nuance.   I'm just showing you what your ideas clearly imply.  Of course there are a million other possible alternatives for determining when to hold referenda!  If you think that's a false dichotomy, either your inference skills are poor or you don't fully understand the term.    When I used the phrase ""either you..."" I was not attempting to shut out possible alternatives, I was directly comparing your idea with mine.  You're bandying about logical fallacies without fully understanding what they mean.  Comparing two things with the word ""either"" is not automatically a false dichotomy!

&gt;And how do you propose that a nation in a non-devolved parliamentary system should achieve independence?

As I said, I'd always understood that if nationalist supporting parties won a majority in Scotland, the UK government would be obliged to call a referendum, even if they were a minority in terms of the wider parliament.  

&gt;The right to self-determination implies that they have the right to a referendum even if the majority of people in the country are unionists. 

For all the fun we've had, I don't actually think it is that simple.  The right to self-determination is obviously one of the thornier issues precisely because it is so vague and dependent on where you draw the boundaries.
It's clear in the Falkland Islands because they are self-contained islands with almost unanimous support for one particular solution to sovereignty.
Scotland is a separate country with it's own clear historical identity, but support is limited. 
And what if one particular town or city wants to become independent?  What if half the city wants to be part of one country, and the other half, another?
Northern Ireland is a good example of the complexities of the issues:  

The majority of people in the Island of Ireland wanted Home Rule as one single country

A minority in the North wanted to remain part of the UK and did not wish to be ruled from Dublin

The dividing line was drawn to ensure a secure and (what was thought to be) a permanent majority in the North supporting partition, rather than where the historical boundary of Ulster was.

Where the line was drawn therefore had no basis in Geography or History; it was purely there to allow support for one sovereign solution.
Within Northern Ireland, cities like Derry/Londonderry were polarised along political and religious lines.

The partition led to civil war, terrorism and massive conflict.

Partitioning countries and cities has historically tended towards conflict.
The right to self-determination is not an absolute.  You do need to look at the broader context of the claim.  It is a question of boundaries.  I was talking about Scotland specifically, which has it's own unique set of circumstances.  Self-determination cannot be applied to any simple majority of people if they lack geographic or historical reasons for the boundaries of their claim.

&gt;Should there be a vote in these cases? My views will be obvious. Maybe yours differ -- but can you at least see how a reasonable person can come to the same conclusions as me?

Actually, in the context of a 300 Year Old Union, the trivial day to day machinations of the political scene is not particularly relevant;  it wouldn't really matter if they held off on the vote until the SNP won outright, just as it doesn't really matter that the SNP now are delaying the vote til 2014 even though they won in 2011.  If there were a clear majority in favour of independence, a few years would make no difference.

Either way, the circumstances in which a referendum was not agreed to prior to now, were very different.

&gt;You have to take into account both positives and negatives, and saying that Brown could have guaranteed a no vote when it's polling as a coin-flip seems crazy.

Maybe read that again.  I didn't say it was guaranteed, I said that he would have been confident of winning.  And he would have been. You can't predict these things for sure, but polls tend to work against the status quo, whereas the final results often show higher support for the incumbent than the polls would have suggested.  

&gt;Rather irrelevant: 18 elections brings you back to 1945. You're talking about a period when the Scottish Unionists (who?!) won a majority in Scotland. The current Labour dominance is a relatively new phenomenon. 

It's certainly not irrelevant - it's reality.   If you want to look at the last 30 years instead, it wouldn't have made any difference to any of the elections except 2010 which was unusually close.  Labour would still have won every election they won in real life, we'd have had exactly the same Prime Ministers.  My point was it would hardly ""gut"" them.

&gt;And it's pretty clear that Labour was deeply opposed to independence: for instance, Blair said in his usual measured tones that it would be catastrophic.

You seem to have confused being personally against independence with being against self-determination in Scotland.  It think it's perfectly possible to be against independence but pro-referendum in the current circumstances without being secretly pro-independence.",0,1329003743,null,0,true,0,c3q9uw4,t3_pi0px,t1_c3q9uw4,t1_c3q13is,null,1428337282,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'm happy this whole incident happened so I can remember exactly why I hate Manchester United as a Liverpool fan. Personally believe Suarez has been bullied in this whole incident and victimized under the banner of racism. Anyone defending Suarez was basically called out for condoning racism. Unbelievable. In my eyes, be it biased eyes, Suarez has done everything correctly. Since the incident he has stayed out of it and simply said I'm not a racist and I did not insult Evra in the racist way. The rest has been the media and random anti-racism groups calling anyone on Suarez's side a racist, just because Evra come up with the notion that Suarez was being a racist. Poor Suarez. Feel sorry for the guy. Is he sometimes out of order? Yes. But this time? No. He has been ostracized for his past and if we as fans don't get behind him and encourage him to change his ways through positive actions other than saying, 'oh yeah Suarez, even as a Liverpool fan I'm disgusted', he will be magnificent minus his bad tendencies. This is our team people, we have to help it than moan how shitly it is doing and how magically it has to change. We as fans, have to be that change and make it happen, there is no magic solution. A team needs to know the supporters have their back through the rough times!

I think fourth is within our grasp, *if* we step up our performance on offense. Defensively we are reasonably stable, up until recently we had the best defense record in the EPL, but our GD is terrible for a team wanting to be in the top 4. I think there needs to be a big shuffle in tactics, and somebody has to step up in the DM position since we don't have Lucas to allow us to push forward more. 

I think that once we have that key role fixed, everything will suddenly turn around. If you have someone there you can trust to do the job, it frees others up (Gerrard, for example) to have more confidence going forward. How often was Gerrard coming back today to help out? How much pressure was there in midfield when Man.U had the ball there? We have struggled with a DM since Lucas left, and it has shown.

That being said, I think he behaved well when Evra did his little celebration only a few feet from him. 

Suarez is a very talented and a very complicated fella. . He scored nearly 50 goals for Ajax in a year and they let him go. They could have afforded to keep him, but they knew he came with a lot of baggage. The bite incident, the hair pulling, the diving, the gloating about the handball in the World Cup. He's no choir boy and it's easy to see why he gets so much stick from the media, even if it sometimes is overblown and undeserved. 

When he first came to the club, I really admired his heart and hoped he had buried all of the shit he seems to stir up. Now I am not so sure.

I believe in him as a footballer, but whether he can learn that sometimes in life you have to choose your battles to reach your bigger goals remains to be seen.

The hard part would be handling it. Would it be part of a plot, would it be out of nowhere?

And handling the character would be important. Don't make her some kind of hypersexed innuendo machine, but don't go the opposite extreme and end up with a matron mother. For some reason, it's harder to make a likable female character on tv, and I believe it's because a female character's sexuality is tied closer to the character than with males. And that just sucks, thanks western society.

Anywho, it would be a risky move. Plus, it would just seem so odd. The Doctor seems to be 'mentally male'. Just as some transgendered people feel they're female inside or something, the Doctor has gone for 11 male incarnations in a row. It would just seem out of nowhere.

However it is not all doom and gloom, we are 4 points off fourth with our next league game against Arsenal,obviously  a 6 pointer  in the race for the last Champions League place.  Hopefully a win in the Carling Cup final will motivate and boost the teams confidence, and allow us to build a consistent run of wins in the remaining league games.

Before kick off I thought line-up had a great chance of getting a result . However as  game drew on, the pattern of the midfield sitting deep and leaving Suarez isolated became frustrating to watch. Gerrard is wasted sitting deep, and needs to be playing off Suarez , just like he used to with Torres. 

It is clear KD has built a solid squad BUT we need more players with flair. Downing should be made to watch a compilation of Antonio Valencia's performance because that is what he should be doing.

true,butwhatisit,eng-cumberland,NXNW,"&gt; the US stats are bad but they are not linked number of guns to deaths, the number of factor that effect these figure is huge let alone which figures are reported.

I'm not sure what you mean here?

The US has a death rate, not including suicide but including accidents, of 4.37 per 100,000 citizens whereas England has 0.008 deaths per 100,000. That's *546 times* higher in the US. Twice as many people again are injured.


&gt;he was a drugged up idiot that showed no regard for the law its lucky that he picked only a chain saw yes but if you think that criminals don't have easy access to gun already then sadly you are dam wrong. 

We're talking different things here. If gun use was more widespread, chances are he may own one or know where to access one (he certainly knew where to get a chainsaw at night) as happens in school shootings in America.


&gt; A U.S. Secret Service study of 37 school shootings in 26 states found that in nearly two-thirds of the incidents, the attacker got the gun from his or her own home or that of a relative.[source](http://www.lcav.org/statistics-polling/gun_violence_statistics.asp#f85)

Gun use is not widespread in the UK and most people will never see a gun in their lives. Most of the guns in the hands of criminals are blanks smuggled in from abroad  -- there is nothing we can ever do to stop that - which have been converted and luckily are prone to misfire. Yes, where there's a will there's a way, but arming the populance is not the answer because it's not not criminals with guns that we should be afraid of - it's everyone.


[In 1997](http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=homicide+statisitcs+uk&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCsQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.parliament.uk%2Fcommons%2Flib%2Fresearch%2Frp99%2Frp99-056.pdf&amp;ei=0R83T-zaFs-g8gPbq7m-Ag&amp;usg=AFQjCNGw7_EPxdRYxqMqFIXIlqyGikqazQ&amp;sig2=8n-RzXATnEJq2roY5mNIig) (page 17) 68% of female homicides and 21% of male homicides the aggressor was the spouse / lover or a family member. This is what worries me - perfectly normal people who just flip out.

[This is an interesting website](http://www.lcav.org/statistics-polling/gun_violence_statistics.asp) - some choice quotes (references on the page) include:


&gt; Abused women are five times more likely to be killed by their abuser if the abuser owns a firearm.

&gt; Domestic violence assaults involving a firearm are 23 times more likely to result in death than those involving other weapons or bodily force.

&gt; A recent survey of female domestic violence shelter residents in California found that.. in nearly two thirds (64.5%) of the households that contained a firearm, the intimate partner had used the firearm against the victim, usually threatening to shoot or kill the victim.

&gt; Children and young adults (24 years of age and under) constitute over 41% of all firearm deaths and non-fatal injuries.


If you're afraid of your safety you might want to consider pepper spray or even tasers before you go down the gun route.

&gt; if this was a corner-shop, a take way even the pub when it was dead you could be looking at a blood bath this only want as there were multiple patrons able to distract an attack from all directions with chairs.


And if the perp had gotten his hands on a gun, it would have been a bloodbath. In all honesty it doesn't look like his aim here was to actually kill - he was crazy and insane but it seems more that he was threatening and trying to prove a point than actually kill anyone. 

Anyway, I'll leave you with this: if we flood the country with guns (there are 90 guns per 100 people in America) there is no reversal.

Had OP put [spoilers] or [Sherlock spoilers] or [possible spoilers] or anything of the sort in the title, spoiler etiquette dictates that in the thread that follows, anything goes and spoilers will probably be everywhere.  
  
It's just a manner of bothering to stop and think about another person besides yourself for a change.  I know that's hard and seems to be a vanishing value and mindset in this selfish age, but it ought to be just common courtesy.  In a DW forum like this, during a hiatus, we ought to reasonably expect almost everyone to be caught up on DW, and those who aren't ought to be fully aware of what's going to be discussed.  While new eps are airing, it's a different matter, since plenty of us can't watch it live and don't get a chance to see new episodes for as much as a week after they air.  
  
For other shows the same courtesy should be shown, *especially* when that show happens to depend on suspense, mystery, and highly-involved plot arcs.  For example, I wouldn't even dream of dropping in a Battlestar Galactica reference that gives away that [spoiler](/s ""Romo Lampkin's cat"") is a Cylon without spoiler tagging it, because I know that knowing that information ahead of time could seriously detract from a person's enjoyment of the unfolding plot.

3 did but he (from what I've seen) always argued for understanding like in ""Doctor Who and the Silurians"" where he tried to stop the army from attacking the Silurians even though they had killed.  

4 had a long run and changed as a Doctor during it but he typically was in favor of looking at the better nature of his enemies, like in Genesis of the Daleks where he refused to commit genocide on them

5 has the same Silurian example as 3 (Warriors of the Deep)

He tricked them in the same way that he tricked Ace in ""The Curse of Fenric"". What he did to her was far worse than what he did to the Daleks or the Cybermen. 

7 wasn't violent in the sense of physical violence. By that measure, 3 was far more violent, what with his Venusian karate and all.

City are the new kids at the big table. We've got the money and we're showing we mean business.

I'm all for refs being impartial, but when they go out of their way to show this, they end up not being impartial.

Your bit about how the similarities of the Doctor all come through in the end reminds me of the original topic here. 3 killed an Ogron and physically fought his way out of many confrontations, but refused to take sides against the Silurians even after they turned hostile. 4 went gun happy in ""The Invasion of Time"" and ""The Deadly Assassin"", but had reservations about killing off the Daleks. 5 was more than willing to be Davros' executioner, but was horrified at the loss of life in ""Warriors of the Deep"". 7, well, I've explained how he was capable of violence, but he also did the great ""If we fight like animals, we die like animals"" speech in ""Survival"". 10 twice offered to save the Daleks, but killed the entire Racnoss family and condemned the Family of Blood to eternal punishment. 

The Doctor is a pacifist, only when it suits him. Davros very accurately said that the Doctor gets other people to do his dirty work for him, but the Doctor is more than capable of taking things into his own hands.

Here's what, watch the new series (2005-) and if you like that, then branch out to classic. After classic you could hop around in books and audios and comics. It'll take years. But first- where in the new series to start...?

Doctor Who ran from 1963-1989 then rebooted in 2005. By no means do I suggest you start at 1963. You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor.

Fair enough. What bugs me about Moffat's writing is that his storyline has been in effect for two years, and there's still precious little by answers or resolution. It might still work out, but I lost faith in it by ""Let's Kill Hitler"". 

I excluded the first two Doctors because I haven't seen enough of their episodes to decide, and also because the character of the Doctor (from a writing standpoint) was still in its infancy. There was no concept of the Doctor being this avenging angel with untold power back then. 

I didn't mention 6 because I honestly haven't seen enough of his stories (but I'm certainly going to rectify that soon). 


&gt;The seventh has been stated but his violence was more manipulation than physical (which you might agree upon?). 

Well, it's like what he did at the end of ""Remembrance of the Daleks"". He literally talked a Dalek into destroying itself. It wasn't violent, per se, but it was destructive. 

&gt;Davros definitely nailed the 10th Doctor, but that same saying isn't true for the 11th or many of the other ones either

I'm trying to remember examples of 11 being violent, or causing violence. He punched out the android scientist in ""Victory of the Daleks"", but that was done for laughs. 

I seem to remember him playing his own game in Series 6, whether unwittingly putting his companions in danger so he could study the Flesh, getting Rory to choose the ""right"" Amy in ""The Girl in the Fireplace"" and breaking Amy's faith in him in ""The God Complex""...but none of those are *violent* examples in the sense we've been talking about. Still, he's only been in the role for two series. Let's see. 

Two things come to mind: one, 9 was given the option of wiping out the Daleks and the human race in ""The Parting of the Ways"", and chose not to; two, while we remember what 10 did to the Racnoss and the Family of Blood, let's not forget that he also caused the death of the Sycorax leader and brought down Harriet Jones when he was still a fresh incarnation.

*Our best guess is that Evra was late raising his hand (for whatever reason we do not know) which made Suarez think he wasn't going to shake it and that is why he went to De Gea.*  

Now we are not sure about this. But when looking at how Suarez hand movement was, Daglish's comments, Suarez's Twitter, this becomes plausible. If Evra's was just hesitent or slow to react to Suarez, then it also understandable why he got annoyed. (Although we all agree Evra's reaction was unjustifiable). But everyone's story made sense and noone was ""bad"" or ""evil"" - just a misunderstanding. 

So with all this considered, SAF and the medias reaction is so irresponsible.  It is biased. It is bad reporting. It is a complete and utter disgrace. I have no idea how we can try and rectify this. Any complaint comes as ""Liverpool fan sticking up for his team no matter what"".

Most of the time when the Doctor resorts to violence it's very personal; he's fighting for his life in close contact with an enemy actively tryign to kill him.  In this case, though, he just picks up a gun and shoots a random enemy soldier!

Baker's scene from *The Seeds of Doom* just reminds me how horrible the episode is.  The first two parts aren't too bad, but it just goes downhill from there.  It's like writer Robert Banks Stewart didn't know how to use the Doctor or his character or his abilities; The Doctor seems more like a random bloke than a Time Lord.  But he also wrote Terror of the Zygons, which was much better, so I'm at a loss as to explain why the Doctor is so out-of-character in this episode.

There is no one way that fans should act last time I looked, if fans blindly went around supporting all the players and decisions the club made no matter what their level of performance was then they wouldn't perform to the level they do. You ask any professional what drives them on and I bet any of them worth their salt will say the adoration of the crowd, or hearing your name chanted. 

This works in reverse as well if Bosingwa continues to turn in the performances for ths club that is currently he should be dropped, it's because we are fans of Chelsea that we expect a certain level of commitment and work ethic, this is why Chelsea fans still like Torres, because he works hard and concentrates, it's also why Chelsea fans are losing patience with Bosingwa and Malouda for example, both players who abilities we have previously seen but who's performances over some period of time this season have been lacking.

Fans who pay money for merchandise and tickets deserve to see player committing to the club and them, if they don't then they deserve stick.

true,evrae,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"&gt;Understood - but 'small business' doesn't apply either; huge chains are (and were, in the case of Sainsburys and Waterstones) using the Workfare system. These well established, large companies can easily afford to pay for staff.

I'm not talking about the way that things *are*, but the way things could be! Large companies really don't need that kind of help. If they're struggling financially it is due to larger problems than can be fixed with free staff.

&gt;but if a company can be helped by having another worker, surely that company should help the economy and country by paying that permission, and making sure that they're off benefits?

What I'm talking about is a short term arrangement. It would let a business take a risk in expanding. If it works out, somebody is taken off benefits. If it doesn't, there's no real change. The company doesn't lose anything for making the attempt, and the person on benefits will be able to show to future prospective employers that they are capable of holding down a job. 

Now, I'm not entirely comfortable with the idea of completely cutting off a person's benefits if they are unwilling (or incompetent) to take such a job (or charity work, community improvements etc). So I would possibly envisage a two-scale arrangement, in which a lower level of benefits remains for those not taking part in the scheme.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"1: You need to learn how to do tax deductions properly. Without sitting down and working out the *exact* figure at 11am on a Sunday morning, it actually works out closer to £9,800 per year gross / approx £188.46 per week or £5.02 per hour [assuming **37.5hrs per week**, which is what I originally stated].

2: As the guy is over 21 [how many people under 21 have got degrees?] he's being short changed by quite a bit more than .41 an hour. I'd need to know exactly how many hours he does on his ""work placement"" before posting an exact figure.

3: This is a UK Specific reddit. Therefore, it seems like interesting information, to state, generally speaking, which part of the country this is taking place in. Especially as people seem to think this work programme only disenfranchises people in more affluent parts of the country.

4: Fuck it, I'll bite:

**Benefits: £590 per month**
If you assume that's a ""living wage"", whist on the work programme, that works out at ~£4.92 per hour, when based on your ""30hrs"" projection.

**Minimum Wage job @ 30hrs Per Week:** 

* Yearly Gross Salary: £8755.20
* Monthly Take home, before deductions: £729.80
* £182.40 Per week.
* 30 hours per week: £6.08. 

**After Deductions:**

* Yearly Take home Salary: £8315.90
* Monthly Take home: £692.99
* £159.92 per week.
* 30 hours per week: £5.33

*Conclusion*

Given that, in this scenario, the person working 30hrs per month on the work programme earns approx. £4.92 per hour, based on the total value of their benefits, divided by one month.

* They lose £1.16 per hour, compared to the rate of minimum wage, *before* deductions, or £34.80 per month.

* They lose .41 per hour, compared to the rate of minimum wage, *after* deductions, or £12.30 per month.

Again, please note, those figures are based on 30hr projections. My original projection was based on a ""full time job"", which typically consists of, at minimum, 37.5hrs per week.",0,1329045668,null,0,false,0,c3qerck,t3_pjvq8,t1_c3qerck,t1_c3qa9xk,null,1428339588,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

For IT systems , for example , rather than being top down and contracting out complete system implementations , the better way would be to be bottom up - just specify all the message formats ( XML on HTTPS ) and the general structure of the infrastructure ( the IP network ) and let the private sector develop and supply all the software and supply all the equipment . As such a GP , for example , would have a choice of hardware and software and would purchase these directly from the providers . In this way British small and medium sized businesses would be supported - they would pay for the development - and the government's risk ( which is massive ) would be minimised .

I could get behind a petition for a pardon for all those people, especially since living people are still hurt by that law, but not just for Turing. Pardoning him doesn't help the living.

&gt; But even that's unnecessary. Subsequent to the 2009 apology campaign the UK government introduced legislation that actually does roll back the criminal convictions of gay men. The Protection of Freedoms bill has already passed all stages in the House of Commons, two readings in the House of Lords and enters (this coming Monday) committee stage. That means it's close to being law.

&gt; Chapter 4 of that Act specifically allows for the disregarding of convictions under the old law that was used against Turing. Once disregarded the law causes their convictions to be deleted. It's not quite the same thing as a pardon, but its effect is to lift the burden of a criminal record from these living men.

I'll confess I haven't read the article yet - I'm on my way out, so I've sent it to my Kindle, I'll read it on the train. With that in mind, apologies if these issues are raised in the article:

Turing was convicted under the applicable laws at the time. By 21st century eyes and morals, said laws are as abhorrent as his lifestyle was perceived, back then.

I can see the ""moral"" argument for pardoning him - unfortunately, I don't think it's practical, or particularly relevant.

If Turning were to be pardoned... Why stop at him? Why not pardon Oscar Wilde? More importantly - why not pardon ""regular people"" who were tried and convicted under the same laws?

How about people who were convicted - or even shot - for refusing to fight in WW1?

Where would you draw the line?

Oh, and I say all that as an openly gay maths nerd, from an I.T. background, whose fascinated by cryptography, and who - when somewhat younger, used to run *everywhere*. Turings' like my personal God, in terms of the reverence and respect I have for him, his works, and his legacy.

A better course of action, would be to honour both his memory, his work, and his legacy, by educating people. Turning was a war hero, whose name should be as well known as the likes of Churchill - instead, he - after decades, he finally gets a statue, placed near Canal Street [a place, where the regulars know fuck all about him].

true,emericuh,lfcflame,,"I think that's a fair answer, but if all of his had happened differently, if Suarez had snubbed (or just pulled his hand away, depending on your theory) Evra and then celebrated at the end, I am certain that our role would be switched with the United's supporters 100%.

It's the nature of supporters. I think everyone, on both sides, is blowing this too far out of proportion and all it's doing is distracting the team from what is important; winning football matches.

Equally, it is the nature of the media to make the most of this, too. Every story needs a villain and a hero, and it's just much easier to give those roles out in the manner they have been than to acknowledge that **both** players are flawed in some way or the other. 

I'm not a Suarez-truther. I think he snubbed Patrice, pure and simple and no amount of odd-angled stills will make me doubt what I saw with my own fucking eyes. Even if Evra's hand was slightly lowered, he passed directly over it to reach for De Gea. He made no effort. The thing is, **I agree with him**. If he truly feels falsely accused, you're goddamn right he shouldn't have shaken his hand. He didn't make a production of it, he didn't stare Evra down, he just went straight to the next player. Evra reacted instantly, but he should have never reached for his arm. That being said, Suarez doesn't make things any easier on himself when he childishly boots a ball in to the stands at the end of the half. 

I am glad so many people are defending Suarez right now, it's the right thing to do. He's in a shit storm right now and we need to back him up. But back him for the right reasons. He was accused of something that even the FA couldn't prove, but was still punished. He shouldn't be expected to smile and shake with Evra. 

I don't think Kenny did the right thing by claiming ignorance to all of it, either. I just don't believe that for a second that after the tunnel fiascos he didn't know what all the fuss was about. It was a calculated move to save face and it backfired. That being said, Kenny was bang on when he told the reporter he was out of order for laying all the blame on Suarez. Evra should have never followed him in to the tunnel at half-time and his final celebration was foolish (even if I think it's being overblown).

I am so tired of talking about this, really. I think that's my final word on it unless someone honestly wants my opinion. Please don't take my viewpoint as one that is against the club. Frankly, I want all of this behind us so we can get back to the game without the soap-opera drama.

true,ragewind,uk,,"what do i mean by number of guns is unrelated to the number of deaths.

the us homicide rate has been drooping along with there rate of crime in general but at the same time they have been buying more and more guns year on year for the last half decade.

as for me saying that there are a wider rage of factors that effect homicide rate.

the economic and sociological property's of the country has a bigger effect. we have more police officers per capita, ours are better trained and disciplined, we have better health care, better social services, better equality in the UK, less racism and homophobia etc these all make crime less likely to happen.

&gt;The US has a death rate, not including suicide but including accidents, of 4.37 per 100,000 citizens whereas England has 0.008 deaths per 100,000. That's 546 times higher in the US. Twice as many people again are injured.

im not sure were you found those figure [the CIA](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2066rank.html) puts UK deaths per million at 9.33 and the US at 8.38

[wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate) list the 2010 homicide rates as UK 1.23 and the US 4.8

the UK guns laws are already the strongest in the world and this is for sporting and vermin control any change in the available uses of them i would expect would come with further checks, conditions and training it would be unlikely that someone that unstable would even be allowed to own weapons under the current system.

US school shooting are another area were there are many factors. yes they perpetrators are likely to have got the weapons from family as most are children and unable to buy there own. this is then down to the family members not securing the weapons properly which they don't have to do in the US in the UK its required period and the owner is responsible to ensure that they are unreachable and as secure as possible at all times.

school shootings are in part picked as location as they know there are no responsible armed citizens at the location and often no real police presence in the area. the us schools are also part of the problem they don't deal with bullying etc and just hand out pills while providing poor education and feed children with ""food"" that would not pass basic safety test over here. comparing the two country is really hard due to the differences in approach.

&gt;Gun use is not widespread in the UK and most people will never see a gun in their lives. Most of the guns in the hands of criminals are blanks smuggled in from abroad -- there is nothing we can ever do to stop that - which have been converted and luckily are prone to misfire. Yes, where there's a will there's a way, but arming the populance is not the answer because it's not not criminals with guns that we should be afraid of - it's everyone.

there are more guns in the UK than many realize with 3.4million legal firearms and estimates of 4million illegal but this is only a basic estimate. although converted blank firing guns are an issue that hit the press they are a tip of the ice burg smuggling guns in to the UK is as easy as smuggling in tonnes of drugs, criminals have no issue getting them.

&gt;[3] This is an interesting website - some choice quotes (references on the page) include:

this site is biased and factually incorrect, it says gun violence claims 30K lives a year [the FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/10tbl01.xls) have a recorded Murder and non-negligent manslaughter going from 24K in 1991 down to 14K in 2010

&gt;If you're afraid of your safety you might want to consider pepper spray or even tasers before you go down the gun route.

i said i was for self defense options upto and including guns as currently non are allowed, it is illegal to carry anything for defense and teasers and pepper spray are illegal.

you say he was crazy and insane (id agree on this) but not out too kill, i wouldn't agree with the not out to kill part. it is a premeditated act to go and collect a chainsaw and go back to slash the hell out of the place this shows no thinking on how far his actions would be taken. he managed to slice one victims to the point of damaging there arm down to the tendons, id say his intent way to kill. yes it could be worse but my point on the ability to defend your self is aimed in a more general area more often than not attacks don't happen in an environment were the attacker is massively out numbered.

as for not going back, we used to have no gun control and have gun makers in every city and it was a case of if you had cash you could buy a gun that did change as they brought in all the different laws. we had a time when opium was literally everywhere and that was able to be changed. i would never expect the UK to end up like the US but i do thing we ave it wrong making all items that can be used for defense currently being illegal.",0,1329056340,null,0,false,0,c3qfdu2,t3_pl4e2,t1_c3qfdu2,t1_c3qb84w,null,1428339896,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

More recently things like Black Mirror, Coppers and 10 O'Clock Live are all pretty good. I've never really watched Shameless but it's been going for about 6 series so it's probably quite good. Misfits was okay. Skins was only good for series 1 and 2. I haven't watched Noel Fielding's luxury comedy, because it looks like all the awful parts of the Mighty Boosh combined into a half hour shit sandwich, but it might be okay. Series 1 of The Hotel was quite funny, although maybe mostly because it was fllmed a few miles away from where I live and I recognised a lot of the people. A few minutes of Hollyoaks has always made me want to slit my wrists. Million Pound Drop and The Bank Job are pretty good as game shows go, I suppose they're different and edgy in the game show world. I like all of Derren Brown's shows as well, he should be doing more this year.

Maybe this year it's got off to a bad start for C4, but to compare it to ITV is very harsh. I don't think I've watched a programme on 'Chav Channel' since they went through a period of all the James Bond films. BBC is also going downhill a bit.

I'm pretty confident C4 should pick up on it's quality a bit and it's still doing fine now.

TL;DR C4 is full of classics and that will never change, despite being a slightly poor patch. There will be more in the future I'm sure.

I liked Arsenal somewhat when I was a wee lad, mostly because Freddy Ljungberg played there. But I liked Manchester United more (like most kids outside of England do at first).

Now when I've followed Spurs this year I've ""learned"" to ""hate"" (dislike) Liverpool (to mention one). It was something I felt because they play dirty and some of their players are a disgrace to football (Suarez, and slightly Carroll). I also dislike Balotelli, Howard Webb, and Chris Foy for obvious reasons.

Today I'm aware of the rivalry that is the North London Derby, but I can't really say that I ""hate"" Arsenal. They play good football at times, and while I don't support them and really want to see us finish above them in the table, I still feel some respect for them. Van Persie is an excellent player, Wenger is an excellent manager (bit of a fluke ATM), and ... Walcott isn't as good as I thought he was, Wilshire is a total douchebag (I've seen his Twitter), etc.

I do make an argument (in this blog post and in the previous one) that not every trvial change in the law should result in pardons, but that some major sea changes should, and that this is one of them.  Where one draws the line is always going to be a contentious issue, but simply *never issuing pardons where a prior law was unjust* is also an exercise in drawing the line and it places the line in a place I disagree with.  Some people may be satisfied with the line where it is and they are entitled to their opinion, but to pretend that no line has been drawn when one refuses to *ever* use a pardon to acknowledge that a past law was wrong is a logical fallacy.


Regarding ""regular people"" who were convicted under the same law, I entirely agree that they should get pardons -- in fact what would be optimal is a blanket pardon.  Getting a pardon for Turing would be a strategic move in this direction.  If you look at my posts regarind the pardon you'll  see that this has always been my position.


I entirely agree that it would best serve Turing's legacy to educate people as widely as possible about his work, both his war service (see my post ""Churchill: Turing made the single biggest contribution to the war effort"") and his other achievements.  If you look at my blog, I hope you'll agree that however small a role it might play in that process, that is exactly what I am trying to do.  


I don't focus exclusively (or even primarily) on his legal status -- in fact I'm rather sick of talking about it, but it's a live issue so from time to time I do.  


The rest of the time I look at how he has influenced the modern world,  the debates over his work (for instance in the post on John Searle and the Chinese Room argument), I try to put his war record in context, I look at his legacy in the arts (where he has left a far larger mark than many people realize), I discuss him as a gay icon, I write reviews of podcasts that deal with his work, I look at how he has not only had a large historical influence but also influenced individuals and moved them to scientific or artistic achievement, and so on.  


So by all means, the more we can educate people about Turing, the better.  I wouldn't put so much work into the blog if I didn't believe in exactly that.

Without definitively checking, the main differences I know of are bronze puts you on the season ticket waiting list (though don't hold your breathe - I'm still somewhere around 35,000th - 38,000th) and an allocation of tickets becomes available for bronze members a day before lilywhite members. 

I can't remember if this bronze allocation is true for all games but in my experience I've never got a ticket during this bronze allocation and had to wait until the next day when they become available to lilywhite members as well so I think the allocation is pretty small.

Oh bronze also gives you ability the buy multi game ticket packages which I've read are really good - but once again I've either missed them going on sale or they sold out super fast.

I think it's highly unlikely you will be able to get tickets to Chelsea away I'm afraid (I can't go either). You'll need to have clocked up at least 3 - 4 solid seasons worth of loyalty points to have any chance and most likely they won't become available to anyone less than silver members (what that big waiting list is for). 

Apart from big champions league matches and Arsenal at home where its a bit of a frustrating lottery on the ticket website as a member you should be able to get tickets to any other home game. Champions league away and Arsenal away are not possible without a season ticket. The less glamorous and futher away from Tottenham games are doable ( I got tickets for Villa, Wolves, and Wigan last season).

If there's some other, more supportable reason for using this law rather than a pardon then I'm open to it, but I've yet to hear it.


The one thing it *does* do, as you point out, is become available to everyone (or almost everyone, more in a moment on that) right now, which is certainly important.  What it doesn't do (that a blanket pardon would do) is give the old guy with the conviction a break without him having to go out and do something about it, possibly including hiring a lawyer, all assuming that he's even heard about it.  If you're some old geezer in a country village somewhere who never quite got around to signing up for the internet it's quite possible that you'll have no idea this is even going on.


The other thing that this law doesn't do that a pardon would do is clear the name of people who are now dead.  That might seem like a minor point, but try telling that to the guy (now an adult) who was mocked and hounded all his life about how his dad was a ""perv"" or whose brother committed suicide after being convicted.  A conviction does not just affect the convicted person, not by a long shot.  


A pardon can have a posthumous effect that would hugely benefit the surviving families of those who were convicted.  With the new law, the convicted person has to apply and they can't do that if they're dead.  I read it and although I could be wrong, or it could be amended before it's passed, I didn't see any provision for a man's estate or relatives to apply on his behalf if he was dead.

Firstly, The Only Way is Essex is in the field of reality television, a medium in which it isn't difficult to become popular. Stand-up comedy on the other hand, is a ruthless field in which only the strongest voiced observational comics seem to be able to break through. For Stewart Lee to popularise his act in this medium, his alternative-to-comedy beautifully paced de-and-reconstruction, is clearly an achievement.

Secondly, although you may not like the Essex show, it clearly has its merits. Many intelligent people watch it, just as many intelligent people watch X-factor and Eastenders with its two-dimensional characters and equally thin plots. It's not meant to be clever, it's meant to draw in viewers, and it does that. If I was talking about Essex, I would say:

&gt;The Only Way is Essex is an incredible *reality show*, as evidenced by its popularity.

Quality and popularity are two distinct beasts, we both understand that, but the latter oftentimes conveys the former.

Third-and-finally, popularity is how we decide a lot of things in life, including our government.

The big problem with Suarez's actions on Saturday is that he placed Kenny and the football club in an awkward situation. He did so by agreeing to shake hands then not doing so. Had he refused to shake hands then either the handshaking 'ceremony' could have been cancelled or Dalglish could have started with Carroll. Either way, what happened yesterday could have been easily avoided.
By agreeing to shake hands then not doing so he has drawn yet more flak to the club, at a time when we need to concentrate on a push for 4th place.
A lot of people are suggesting it wasn't Suarez's fault, Evra withdrew his hand, and there does seem to be something fishy about Evra not extending his hand, but the proper thing to do was for Suarez to look him in the eye and stand in front of him with his hand outstretched. If Evra didn't want to shake the world could see who was snubbing who.

true,snazzgasm,null,null,"I don't think Channel 4 should be singled out here. The only ITV content of interest for me recently has been TV Burp, and Channel 5... well, let's not talk about Channel 5.

At least Channel 4 is investing money in new things as well, like the short films they show late at night, excellent, daring dramas like Black Mirror that you'd be hard pressed to find elsewhere, comedies like Fresh Meat, The Inbetweeners and Friday Night Dinner all seem to have their own followings (new Peep Show is due later this year, too) and shows like Skins and Shameless (don't really appeal to me, but still very popular in their own rites.

On top of that, there's the new TV Book Club on More4, they're reworking 10 O'Clock Live and they're still dedicated to producing well loved game shows like Countdown, DoND and Million Pound Drop (and if I recall, there's a new game show on its way in a week or so).

I'm sure that's only scraping the surface, and whilst it's not classed as original content, it's nice to see they're still getting some decent American imports (probably only second to 5/5 USA in this department) like Curb Your Enthusiasm on More4 recently, the new series New Girl, the final series of Desperate Housewives on E4 (I'm politely ignoring the rest of E4, here) and a couple of months ago they were even quietly pumping out ""new"" episodes of The Simpsons under the radar.

There's plenty of stuff from Channel 4 if you look for it, and admittedly their original stuff could come round a little more often, but I really don't feel like they deserve singling out in this manner, because even if their offering isn't quite up to scratch for you, I'd make a point of judging TV as a whole, instead of focusing on the one channel.",0,1329063256,null,0,false,0,c3qg2t3,t3_plgfh,t1_c3qg2t3,t3_plgfh,null,1428340303,1,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,1

true,Anonymous_Bosch,null,null,"I'm not a Liverpool fan. I'm a Manchester United fan, but I just wanted to say something about this whole incident.

It is depressing but unsurprising that primitive tribal responses are so commonplace in football. Every single Liverpool fan I call a friend was embarrassed at Liverpool's handling of this incident. Suarez is plainly not a racist man, but he did act the bollocks that day and deserved to be punished. Yesterday he let himself down, as did Kenny Dalglish, but the club realises this and thank goodness has decided enough is enough.

I have supported United since 1987 but I'd like to think the important issues supersede tribal issues for me. When Eric Cantona attacked that fan I wanted him out of the club forever and I still think of him, not fondly as almost all United fans do, but as a violent and arrogant maniac who disgraced the club and the badge. 

I realise the hypocrisy of Alex Ferguson. In 1997 he stood up for Peter Schmeichel when Ian Wright [accused him of racially abusing him](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/ferguson-stands-up-for-schmeichel-1280049.html). Ferguson cannot afford to preach from his soapbox on this issue and he would do well to remember it. No club is perfect and no club is the source of all evil.

It's my opinion that this case was cut and dry: Evra was racially abused. Then he was booed at Anfield because he was racially abused. (Spare me the excuses: he was booed because he had the cheek to take action against Suarez, not because he's a 'Manc' or a 'prick'). Then his hand was refused by Suarez, and anyone who still peddles the lie that Suarez offered his hand first is blinded by tribal loyalties.

Take a look on the Guardian website or any other relatively intelligent source of football fandom. The Liverpool fans there (and the ones I call my friends) are a credit to their club and pretty much reflect what I think. The ones who continue to casually abuse Evra and proclaim Suarez's innocence/sainthood are truly a disgrace and the polar opposite of the club whose manager once said: 'John Barnes is not a black footballer. He's a footballer'.

I believe that the de-criminalization of gay sex is a legal change of this type, especially in view of the fact that there are still men alive who continue to be stigmatized with a criminal record for something that these days wouldn't even elicit comment, much less a charge.

Consider the phrase ""I don't give a fuck."" This has essentially the same meaning as ""I couldn't care less."" Now consider ""I could give a fuck."" Put the emphasis on the word ""could"" as if you're considering your options. As in ""well I suppose I *could* give a fuck... but the fact remains that I don't.""

The above makes sense and even fits with the sarcasm excuse that is often deployed (it is well known that Americans do not fully understand sarcasm).

The problem is easy to see when you consider the fact that ""I don't care less"" is completely meaningless. So while the phrases ""I don't give a fuck"" and ""I could give a fuck"" can be considered equivalent, the same logic cannot be applied to ""I couldn't care less"" and ""I could care less.""

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"I think he did want to leave. He's an actor, he wants to act, not play the same role into infinity. Look at all the work he's done since *Doctor Who*. He had been the Doctor for five years, a new team was coming in, it was as good a time to leave as any. I'm sure he'd have regrets - who wouldn't? - but he made sure to go before he drastically overstayed his welcome. 

Why was the character miserable about regeneration at *The End of Time*? The easiest explanation is that this marked the first time the Doctor actually liked one of his regenerations, that was so glad to not have died that he didn't want to sacrifice a regeneration to save little old Wilf, etc. etc. 

Personally, I don't buy it. I think it was a case of Davies wanting to finish his tenure with a bang - a well-deserved bang - so much so that it became part of the story itself. There was no natural reason why the Doctor would be *that* shaken up about a regeneration - if we believe he still has 12 regenerations, he'd know this wasn't the end of the line for him - but yet we had all those mournful off-camera looks, the crying, Murray Gold trying to win an Oscar with ""Vale Decem"" (a gorgeous piece of music either way you look at it), and the whole ""I don't want to go"" bit. Something more for the kids who had grown up with David Tennant than the ones who grew up knowing that regeneration happens every few years. 

Give me ""You were fantastic. And you know what? So was I?"" any day of the week. *Any* day of the week. 

If *Doctor Who* ever has a true series finale, it won't be nearly as over-the-top as what Davies wrote for *The End of Time*.

true,Antagony,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire Pudding,"&gt;… *never issuing pardons where a prior law was unjust* is also an exercise in drawing the line… 

No. The blanket refusal we have now is the exact opposite of drawing a line. The expression 'drawing a line' implies there is room below *or above* the point at which it is drawn. But in the case of repealing laws it has *never* been the case, as far as I know, that previously convicted people get pardoned. What you are arguing for is a single exception, which, if granted, would *then* represent a line. A line which could be moved again and again over time. Better I think to keep it as a definitive 'no' than to change it to a subjective decision about which past crimes are worthy of post-repeal pardoning and which are not.

&gt;… to pretend that no line has been drawn when one refuses to *ever* use a pardon to acknowledge that a past law was wrong is a logical fallacy.

Acknowledgement that a past law was wrong is implicit in its abolition. I don't think changing the meaning and purpose of pardons will make any difference to that. ",0,1329071159,null,0,false,0,c3qh8tg,t3_plc4s,t1_c3qh8tg,t1_c3qfngb,null,1435740044,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

As I just said to strolls, I should have made it clear this was the firearm related death rate, not simply homicides in general. [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate#cite_note-CDC-3)

&gt; it would be unlikely that someone that unstable would even be allowed to own weapons under the current system.

Sadly when it comes to domestic violence it's nigh on impossible to see the signs in advance, both for the spouse, the victim and perpetrators friends, and especially the authorities. Someone I know is on bail for this - we never saw it coming but he's now a social outcast. 

&gt; i said i was for self defense options up to and including guns as currently non are allowed, it is illegal to carry anything for defense and teasers and pepper spray are illegal.

What I was getting at with tasers and pepper spray was a proposition that, if self defense is the goal, surely we should wish to legalise these way before guns. 

I guess we're going to agree to disagree. I'm not against self defense at all, I'm just against any weaponry that can so easily maim and kill and guns to me are more of an attacking weapon than something one would use in self defense. I would certainly feel a lot more vulnerable if guns were legalised.

A few years ago, having not watched TV for six months, I looked into getting a refund. Applied for six months worth, and was told I'd need to submit proof I no longer had a television - i.e. that I'd sold my set.

Contacted TVL, explained that I still had the set[s], and that I just wanted a refund, as I wasn't using them to watch live tv.

Without going into all the details - by the time I put the phone down, I'd been told, in no uncertain terms that a ""note"" had been put onto my file, and that if I failed to renew my licence, I would be ""investigated for conspiracy to not pay your tv licence"". The refund, I was told, was an absolute no-no.

Ended up writing to them [CC'd to my MP] outlining the conversation, why the person was full of crap, and demanding both an aplology, and a refund. Ended up getting both, and have had no hassle from them since.

TVL seem to view the TV licence as a necessary form of tax - it's not, it's a payment for a service. If you're not utilising that service, you don't pay - and shouldn't be harassed to do so.

Re ""drawing a line.""  I think this is getting more into a semantical point than real content.  Semantics can be important, but I'm not sure its crucial here, so I'm going to put that to one side and just accept the way you've contructed the notion of a ""line"" as something that must have territory on either side of it.  In that sense, then, I think we agree that you are arguing for no line and I am arguing for a line.

As to whether there has ever been a situation where the repeal of laws resulted in pardons, no this has never existed in any automatic way (to my knowledge anyway).  But my point is that prior to the present policy -- and in many jurisdictions like Canada and the United States this is still the case and it functions perfectly well -- the legal remedy of the pardon at least retains enough discretion that it *can* be used in this way when a persuasive case can be made for doing so. The UK has implemented a policy that fetters that discretion, restricting it to cases where the person was technically innocent of the crime but the judicial system (for whatever reason) failed to recognize that innocence.  

Removing that fetter doesn't necessarily result in some kind of anarchy, as the other jurisdictions I've mentioned make clear.  You don't see society mired in endless paralyzing debates about where to put the line in these places.  

Finally, abolishing a past law doesn't always imply an acknowledgment that it was wrong.  Sometimes it has simply become irrelevant.  Sometimes an administrative rule or other type of measure has come to seem more appropriate than a criminal sanction.  Sometimes enforcing it is simply too expensive or inconvenient.  Sometimes it implies a legal  ""wrongness"" (we shouldn't have a law about this) but not a moral ""wrongness"" (we shouldn't condemn people for engaging in consensual sex).  

I'll stipulate that in this case it probably does reach the point of an acknowledgment that the old law not only shouldn't have existed, but that the judgment implicit in the law was inappropriate.  But this only makes it more important to have a pardon, not so much for Turing (although I still think that matters), but more importantly for the ""convicts"" who are still alive, and who still have to tick the box on that job application or old folks' home admission form that says they have a criminal record.  If I'm not mistaken, although Turing's conviction was in the 50s decriminalization didn't happen until the late 60s, which means there could still be quite a lot of fairly active people out there living their lives burdened with a conviction for this offence.

Try explaining that to the very small minority of people who actually ""care"" about this problem. This small minority is also typically the cause of the problem.

Its going to go this way. Since if half of the people don't really care they will settle for ""N. Ireland"" the other half who do care will be divided to 25% each. So we should put it to a vote.

This hypothesis is not without its problems and other linguistics professors [disagree with it](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/001182.html). 

Either way, English is irregular, and its words and idioms are defined by their usage. Yes, it may irritate some that ""flammable"" and ""inflammable"" have come to mean the same thing, or that there exist many idioms that don't make instant logical sense (you're ""head over heels"" in love? But your head is always over your heels..)

When it comes to ""could care less"" people approach it with the wrong attitude that there is a logical way of speaking that people *ought* to speak, when really it is just a talismanic phrase that irritates them for some reason and their own speech is full of countless just as ""illogical"" words and phrases anyway.

It is, as I've said before elsewhere, better than nothing, it's just that ""better than nothing"" is not satisfactory.


The main points I find deficient are as follows (and if you're aware of the debate you may already be aware of them, but I'll set them out briefly just in case):

(a) it puts the onus on the person who has the criminal conviction to apply to have his record ""disregarded.""  The law was wrong and the onus for correcting the mistake should be on the government that enacted the law, not on the people who were wronged.  If I were one of the people with a conviction (which I'm not, by the way -- I'm not even in the UK) I shouldn't have to do anything to clear my name of something which I ought not to have been criminalized for in the first place.  Someone from the government should be issuing a blanket pardon and sending *me* something in the post saying ""hey, dude, you no longer have a record for this offence.""  So this is simply wrong as a matter of principle.


(b)  The same thing (the onus issue) is wrong as a matter of practice as well.  With this Bill it is almost certain that there will be people who could benefit from it who will never hear about it and therefore won't apply.  Remember that a lot of the folks who were convicted under the old law are, well, old, meaning that they may well not be internet connected, which is where a lot of the discussion of the Bill is taking place.  It is not just that some people should have their records ""disregarded"" and other people should not based on the happenstance of who finds out about it and who doesn't.


(c)  If the person with the conviction is dead, there is no provision in the Bill for someone else (their estate, their relatives) to apply on their behalf.  Clearing someone's memory counts, and there is also real value for the surviving family of the convicted person in de-stigmatizing that person.  When someone was convicted under this law, it was not only them who was harmed.  The child who grew up being mocked for having a ""pervert"" for a dad, or the guy whose brother killed himself after being convicted of gross indecency and who has had to live with that grief all these years, also deserve some benefit, but if their convicted relative is dead then there is no mechanism for them to get it.

I may have missed something, but those are the main points that come to mind from memory.

At face value one could take away the idea that we Brits are more violent, we just don't have general access to weapons that have a higher likelihood to result in death, perhaps a reason why the UK homicide rate per 100,000 is 1.23 in the UK and in the US 4.8.

true,JetSetWilly,null,null,"""flammable"" and ""inflammable"" often irritate people for being an example of irregularity though. Yes, the words may have always mean what they do and may date from the same period - that doesn't matter. ""Could care less"" dates from the 50s! It sprung up at the same time as ""Couldn't care less"" - but still people go on like it is some novel corruption. 

They are not really conflicting at all. Is anybody actually confused when someone says ""I could care less""? Are there significant amounts of real, existing instances of confusion due to ambiguity? I don't think so! Everybody who complains about ""could care less"" is well aware of what it means.

For me, ""could care less"" adds to the richness of the English language. We have an idiom where the addition of a negation has no effect on the meaning, and the only difference is stylistic. Neat.

For being pacific, I must say, I consider it the only way forward. My attitude is that the lowest street bum speaks english that is not inherently worse than the Queen's.  Yes, education may limit his vocabulary, and in a global civilisation it is useful to have some sort of standard that allows people everywhere to communicate easily. That standard is decided by those that speak it, through usage. There's no ""Academy of English"" making lofty pronunciations of what is and isn't English, and no rules other than common practise. ""Could care less"" is very common! I have no issue with it, though it isn't the sort of thing I'd say myself.

EDIT: Just so my point is clear, you are right about Haaland, Rooney and Giggs, personally thats up to them if they want to be scum of the pitch like Downing hitting his GF (although not sure he was actually charged for it, but i'm sure it was probably true.) And as for Ferdinand, I don't know enough about the drugs thing, I know he didn't show up and I don't know if he passed the test the next day, but the ban was certainly out of proportion but I never want to see him on a pitch again after the 'without murdering anyone' chants at moscow '08.

It's wasn't just any other hand-shake. What you and many others are doing in this case is being selective and incredibly narrow minded. Do you think if the whole thing hadn't had happened, SAF would have asked for Suarez to be removed from the team just because he didn't shake his Evra's hand? You are getting too hung up on the hand-shake, and missing what it symbolizes.

He said, she said, at the end of the day, an **INDEPENDENT** panel, approved by **both MUCF and LFC (hence Kenny and Suarez)**, found him him guilty of using racist language in a derogatory way. **SUAREZ HIMSELF ADMITTED HE USED THOSE WORDS**, but claimed ignorance as his defense. After reading that 115-page report, I would think even the most one-eyed of Liverpool fans would agree that Suarez was in the wrong, but it clearly isn't so.

Now, if a person comes to the U.K. from a country where men treat women harshly and unfairly, and slaps a woman for whatever reason, and says it's O.K. in his country to do so, would you say, ""ah tada-tada, then it's alright"" and fanatically support him, in the meanwhile becoming an expert in all things his country (like RAWK et al became linguistic experts in a matter of minutes)? Or would you punish him? Why did LFC not appeal the verdict if they were the victims? No innocent person would take a punishment for such a big thing just after one hearing. He/she would take it to the highest court possible in order to clear his/her name. I know I would.

And what if the same guy has a history of pulling shit like this (no apology to Ghana for an act of incredible un-sportmanship and celebrating that penalty in front of them, biting someone, diving all over the place, pulling Rafael's hair, kicking Parker in the chest and gouging his eyes amongst others)?

This hand-shake was to put an end to the matter. Evra was the victim, yet he got heavily abused officially by LFC and vehemently by their fans. This hand-shake was a way to say - it's over, and we're sorry. Suarez told Kenny he would do so. But at the last moment, he bailed, and hence the outrage.

It's 2012, and LFC fans are defending someone who said ""Blackie, blackie, I don't talk to the blacks, blackie, blackie, blackie, blackie"" and refused to shake the hands of that person he said that to months after that.

1. The independent panel found Suarez guilty based on probabilities, you can take your RAWK et al comment else where, linguistic experts found that if it was said in the context Evra had explained it was racist, if it was in the context Suarez said it was in it wasn't remotely offensive at all.

2. Physical abuse is very very different to verbal abuse, racism is still absolutely awful and should have no place in any walk of life, also there is a very big difference between a mis understanding of calling someone black in a friendly manner and physically hitting someone, never will harming someone be something friendly and non offensive, how you can draw parallels I'll never know.

3. LFC going to appeal against a system that finds 99.5% of those accused guilty and risk the chance of a further ban, I think not.

[Ferguson again calling people ""typical Germans"" when referring to players surrounding the referee.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/apr/07/manchester-united-bayern-munich)

In addition, claims that Schmeichel made racist remarks against Ian Wright were dropped after **no evidence was found**. Please note the difference between **evidence** and **testimony**. 

[Something interesting:](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/ferguson-stands-up-for-schmeichel-1280049.html) Before the case was dropped, Ferguson defended Schmeichel vehemently, pointing out that Schmeichel had participated in coaching in the townships of South Africa. 

Irrelevant, but you might also want to consider the following on racism from Ruud Gullit:

&gt;""If someone calls me a black so-and-so, I don't take it as a racist thing because I am black!"" said Gullit, whose team play Manchester United in another vital title game at Stamford Bridge today. ""Take it as a compliment, it means they are probably afraid of you.""

&gt;As one of the most gifted players of his generation, the Dutchman with a Surinam background was confronted by all kinds of abuse from opponents desperate to unsettle him.

&gt;""The key is that there is emotion in the game and if someone is red, you'll call them a red whatsoever,"" he said.

&gt;""The best thing always for every player, wherever he comes from, is to just try to play well and play your own game and then all these things vanish.

&gt;""If people are swearing at me that means they are afraid of me. That gives me a sort of superiority over them.""

&gt;However, he draws the line at organised racism. ""When Ajax played in Hungary the crowd made jungle sounds all the time when the black players had the ball. That is abusive,"" he said.

&gt;""That had nothing to do with the football game, it had nothing to do with emotions, it wasn't funny.""

I have always maintained that I don't see why it's wrong to use racial terms when trying to insult/wind up somebody in an intimate setting. Let's say two people (one white, one black) are in a fight over a girl. They are fighting each other, punching and kicking and obviously they are trading insults at the same time. They insult each other for everything from their mothers to their parentage, size of their dicks etc. In another scenario, same thing plays out, but the white guy calls the black guy a blackie.

Which is just generally a rude thing to do.  I think a lot of things suck but I don't just go ""hey, you suck"" I offer constructive reasons why or I shut up.

You then made it clear that your actual problem with my valentines was the photoshopping, which is dumb because the visuals are clearly just a medium to get the crappy pun across like every other joke valentine ever.  You might as well go complain at Kate Beaton for her poor line art.  Oh and then you mistook my jab at your comedic taste for being genuinely insulted.  So, that happened.   

Also, Phantom Menace... ok... Phantom Menace got just under 40% on RT from the top critics.  That's not ""only butt-hurt fans"", Speaking of an, the actual fans of Star Wars mostly hated it and were ""butt-hurt"" to use your stupid phrase because it was a huge kick in the dick to them and they should have been upset for reasons I'll explain at the end of this paragraph, the critics who *did* like it complimented it mostly for it visuals and FX while almost universally panning the plot and characters.  And yes, it did well among the 6-12 year old male demographic it was targeting but since there was a huge fanbase in their 20s and 30s when it came out it was a crappy thing to do to ignore them to appease the kids.  That would be like making the new season of Who try to appeal to americans by giving the Doctor a gun and cutting all the britisism from it.  Yeah, the new fanbase will like it; but it's kicking the established one in the teeth for the sake of a cash grab.

I actually LIKED the Phantom Menace because I was 12 when it came out and I was the target demo but as an adult who has seen the rest of the series and had a taste of the expanded universe, I completely understand why the established fanbase were so upset with it.

&gt; Dear Mandy

&gt;While reading about the history of Christmas crackers on your website I stumbled upon the word 'cosaques', and wondered what the origin of it may be. I double-clicked to highlight this curiosity and poised to summon my menu of context, but alas, my clicker had been rendered lame!

&gt;""What foul witchcraft is this‽"" I cried, then delved into the source to see it for myself. There in the head of the beast I found the signature of the Demon of Dynamic Drive followed by a spell of malign intent, a menace that plagued the Internet in the late '90s. Removing visitors' hands as they entered the door was a common anti-theft practice on the yesterweb, but is regarded as barbaric today.

&gt;I plead that you exorcise this menace, for the good of all that is holy please send it back to the decade from whence it came!

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"You don't need to watch episodes in order except for 2-parters. And series 6, really that's the most arc heavy series DW has ever had, so watch that one in order.

Doctor Who ran from 1963-1989 then rebooted in 2005. By no means do I suggest you start at 1963. You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor. The ninth only has one series with some questionable writing, but he's a fantastic Doctor as well, and shines when given the chance. No matter what you do, watch all six series.

true,kinggimped,cnty-expat,Expat (Shanghai),"&gt; The tradition of wearing hats goes back to Roman Saturnalia celebrations (celebrated around 25 December) when participants also wore hats.

I always thought that because the hats originated from the Saturnalia, there was a different reason why everybody wore them at Christmas (which takes place at the same time as the Saturnalia - as many people know, the Catholic Church purposefully moved the birthdate of Jesus to Saturnalia in order to drown out the Pagan celebrations). The Saturnalia was a 'topsy-turvy' festival where role reversal was common, so it was common in private celebrations for the masters to throw a great feast for their slaves, some sources even claim that for that one day a year the masters might serve food to the servants, or at least eat alongside them.

Because of this, I always assumed the paper crowns might be a remnant of the *pilleus*. The *pilleus* was a cap that Roman non-slaves would wear to mark their freeborn status. However, during Saturnalia, slaves were permitted to wear them too, to illustrate the spirit of the festival.

So I guess perhaps I'm wrong, though it was just an assumption I made from two related pieces of knowledge. Having said that, I disagree with the Twelfth Night origin story, since that implies *one* person wearing a hat (thus maybe one cracker per pack would come with a crown)... the *pilleus* origin story works better in my mind because the whole point was that *everybody* wore a hat, so that for one day in a year, slaves and citizens were equal.

He started winning the second season despite another frustrating transfer market without players to fit his game (e.g. Ramirez). He continued to win until his authority was thrashed by the board (RW's sacking) and the mercs decided to do their own thing. The transition you talk of, what was he meant to do, play Kakuta and Sturridge? Neither player could hit a barn door last year and when they did get a chance they look like they couldn't be bothered, there was more than one occasion with each when all they needed to do was follow the play with a little jog and they would have received a pass in the box, instead they were stationary ten metres behind. Van Holt (or whatever the Dutch left backs name is) look decidedly put out when he was ask to play the last half hour in a Champions League game.

Costs are kept resonable . Access is very good - it is very easy to walk into a doctor's surgery and be seen very quickly . It is also very easy to get specialist care .

There are state owned hospitals - teaching and specialist . Most of the hospitals , however , are owned by a combination of doctors co-ops ( a few ) , church etc. based ( quite a lot ) and private companies ( quite a few ) and town councils etc. .

One of the things that they did have is that a small percentage of the GP's fee had to be paid by the patient , however I don't know whether it still operates that way ( as I'm UK based I'm covered 100% under the reciprocal agreement ) . This was to ensure that the patient was conscious of the costs and wouldn't unnecessarily visit the GP .

Medicare , and the insurance companies in general , operate on the basis of being billed on a per procedure basis . This operates in a simple basis and and usually a fair basis .

I was on the 8.30am weekday met just pulling into Victoria when I heard a thud and a gasp. I turned round and a guy dressed in a suit is on the floor unconscious. The doors open and people get off, nobody helps him. I'm looking at everyone and they're either looking concerned, or just pretending they haven't noticed and are looking out of the window. I have to shout down the crowded met 'SOMEONE TELL THE DRIVER TO STOP, THERE'S SOMEONE HERE WHO NEEDS HELP!'. No response. I hear the doors start to beep as they're about to close - people are happy to let the metrolink move on, even though this guy is still out cold. I make the decision to pull the emergency stop lever before they shut. By this time the guy is coming round and I help him onto the platform, I literally have to scream at people to get off and out of the way so we can actually get off the damn thing. I sat him down and waited with him until he said he was feeling better.

Suarez believes that Evra is a liar and a cheat and, though being told he should, he choose not to shake Evra hand. Evra drew back his hand, but I also see no indecation that Suarez wanted to take it either. Suarez didn't shake someone who he strongly believes to have lied and cheated his way into causing Suarez to miss 1/5th of the season. As an individual, Suarez has done nothing wrong, but as a profesional, I thought he could have sucked it up. He didn't have to be happy about it, just to do it and get this whole thing ended. 

Whose fault that handshake was can be put down to both, Evra can be blamed for being a douche and clebrating in front of Suarez, but Suarez took that like a man and just let him do what he wanted. 

As for Kenny and Fergie, it is simple. Kenny is someone who will stick by his man, always, and in this case it is no different. What Fergie is doing, is getting under skins, and possibly letting his emotions get to him (I doubt it since he is a professional), and it seems to be working, he has got plenty of people worked up and has done little. As to the incidents that happen with his own players, there is a simple fact, THEY ARE HIS PLAYERS. It is something that everyone does, they stick by their friends, their players, even in the worst of situations. 

Personally I feel the whole ordeal is stupid and should have been dealt with when it started. Liverpool have done sorely in the sense that they allowed it to go to court. A simple ""He has said something that in his country is not offensive, if he has caused any insult or harm to Evra, then we sincerely apologise."" instead of taking it to court and making a fuss. The fact that this continued I blame on Liverpool, past that, everyone is at fault (note the FA is included in this).

In my case, I moved into a flat in Portsmouth shortly after graduating from university. Because my budget was a bit tight thanks to moving expenses, I didn't set up my TV for six months after moving in.

When my budget had room to pay the licence fee, I went online, bought a licence, and waited for confirmation that I was indeed licensed. Once I had that confirmation, I set up my TV. This was my first contact with TV Licensing; they had not written to me since I moved in, and so the first they knew of me was when I contacted them to buy my licence. They later confirmed that this was true - they genuinely hadn't been aware that I'd moved into a previously empty flat until I contacted them to buy my licence.

TVL then obtained (presumably from the council) the date on which I registered to vote in Portsmouth; upon realising that I'd been living in a flat without their knowledge for 6 months, they decided to assume that I had been watching TV illegally for that time period. It took me 3 years to get it through TVL's collective heads that if they wanted to get me to pay for that time period, they would have to get a court involved.

At that point, they passed it to their ""prosecutions team"", who promptly dropped it due to the complete lack of evidence. However, it shouldn't have taken 3 years and approximately 30 letters to get them to drop it - a saner organisation would have recognised very early on that someone who approaches you to buy a licence completely unprompted is probably not worth chasing for 6 months of unproven back payment.",0,1329147391,null,0,false,0,c3qrrg1,t3_plyxi,t1_c3qrrg1,t1_c3qgf2g,null,1428345929,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Why don't the other Doctors use Venusian Akkido/Karate when they have the opportunity?

So my theory is that the Time Lords regarded Earth as primitve, and they didn't intend for The Doctor's imprisonment on some backwards planet to be a death sentence.  And they temporarily removed some of his knowledge of temporal theory and how to use the TARDIS.  So in turn, they gave him knowledge for personal defense... figuring he might need it to survive on the violent, primitive Earth.  After he regenerated, he uses such techniques less and less... because they were only a temporary gift for the purposes of his incarceration on Earth.

true,gadget_uk,null,null,"&gt; I don't think you'll find many intelligent Liverpool supports who will argue that Suarez didn't say 'negro'/'negrito' 

This is true. Reason being that Suarez *admitted* saying that and, in my opinion, tried to engage honestly with the FA to clear up a cultural misunderstanding in the right way. If he'd have just denied ever saying anything at all there is *no way* that he'd have been found guilty because there was no video evidence and no statement from other players (or the referee) to support Evra's claims. 

If anyone has any doubt left that Suarez calling Evra ""Negro"" would be perfectly acceptable in South America then I hope [this image](http://m24digital.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/negro.jpg) clears it up. These men are not racist and are using the word with affection - just as Suarez claimed when he said ""I just called him something his teammates call him"". 

Of course, no player will make the same mistake of behaving like an adult with the FA again.

The handshake thing pains me. Personally I don't blame Suarez for blanking Evra. He *is* a massive prick and the easily obtainable videos of him using the ""N word"" show just how sensitive he really is about that sort of language, bless the poor little princess. It pains me because he told the club he *would* shake hands. After the club has backed him so fully he should have followed that promise through. I really hope he can recover from this episode, it must have been deeply painful for him personally. 

As for Fergie, well Mr Bosch has said everything there needs to be said about him - he's a master baiter (hurr hurr) and he knew he was going to escalate the issue with those comments. Having said that, we can learn from him. When ManU have faced controversy like this he was *brilliant* at creating a siege mentality amongst the players. They won countless games because they went out with a ""fuck everyone"" attitude. If we can bring a bit of that into Anfield it'll create a steely edge that we could really use right now. Who knows, Downing might even try to get a cross off the floor for once.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"What the Labour Party needs to do is tell Blair that much as he may feel his three-term winning means he knows what he's on about, he was at the helm of a Labour administration which has been blamed (rather amazingly) for a global recession in the eyes of most voters.

His views on where Labour needs to go should be discredited. His approach left the Labour Party divided between him and Brown, and the plethora of authoritarian-themed legislation could be looked at in a very bad light.

Drawing the party into the banks might look popular for the funding and heart of the party in the long run, but the key point to remember is that the Labour Party did not replace the Liberal Party by being Tory-lite. They had a clear ideological platform that had an agenda with the people who would vote for it. It might not be as applicable today as it once was, but the issues with the NHS and unions at present are almost certainly going to cause people to look back at the origins of the NHS and Labour, and they will find the party today lacking the spirit that used to drive it.

Advice is advice, and it might be useful, but to let Blair lead the party down old roads again and on to more New Labour stuff will end up dividing the party again as there are plenty of people who seem to want a clear break from the Blair years.

Selling a player because he won't shake hands? Stupid. Suarez isn't paid to shake hands, so why does it matter? And as Evra made clear to everyone during the game, he's a complete asshole. So why shake his hand when he's the sole reason for this fiasco? Maybe next time we play United we should just skip the whole handshake in the first place, it's just a charade anyways. If we skip it, it will let United know how we really feel about them. Furthermore, to call this a ""race row"" is ridiculous. Yes, Suarez said something slightly insensitive not thinking it would be offensive, but in return Evra acted like he had been stabbed the word wounded him so badly. And his reports of not even liking to say ""the word""? Go to youtube and you can find a video of him saying something like ""Motherfucking niggas"" on a hotel room balcony. If you're so hurt by the word, you wouldn't be saying it, even as a joke. So calling this ordeal a ""race row"" is bullshit. If you have to call it something, call it what it really is Suarez v Evra.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"Right so 30hrs @ Minimum Wage = £182.40. Over the course of a month, that's £729.60.

If you divide the £589 benefits money, by the same number of hours - i.e. 30hours per week, over the course of a month?

**£4.91 per hour.**

**Conclusion:**

For every hour this person spends on the work programme, they're being ""paid"" £1.17 **less** than minimum wage, if you take into consideration all their benefits, and divide it by the number of hours they're on the work programme. 

That's £35.10 per week, or £140.40 per month, less than someone who gets minimum wage.

Now at this point you'll likely argue that's an unfair calculation, as the person on minimum wage pays tax &amp; National Insurance? That's true, but only once they reach a certain tax threshold.

But if you want that calculation - hell, why not, let's compare ""apples to oranges"" as it were.

**Person working 30hrs Per Week; 120hrs Per Month**

Gross Pay: £729.60
Deductions: £36.61
**Take Home: £692.99**

That works out to £5.33 per hour, after deductions. Which as I pointed out in my last post, means that a person ""being paid"" in the form of benefits, still earns less than minimum wage, after the applicable rate of tax on minimum wage. [£12.30 per month]

Speaking of comparing Apples and Oranges - my understanding is that you're still required to jobsearch, whilst on this work programme, is that not correct? If you fail to meet that requirement, you'll receive a sanction.

Such a condition doesn't apply to someone working, earning the minimum wage.

Let's assume you're required to jobsearch for 2.5hrs per week. It's probably more, but we'll opt for that. That works out to 10hrs per month.

So if you ""add"" those ten hours, onto the 120hrs someone on the work programme will be working, as part of their placement?

£589 benefits / 130hrs Work Placement + Jobsearch = **£4.53 per hour.**",0,1329155032,null,0,false,0,c3qt1ly,t3_pjvq8,t1_c3qt1ly,t1_c3qqjor,null,1428346521,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In order to succeed in Scotland the pro-unionist campaign needs to make itself about the advantages of Scotland remaining in the union, not the disadvantages of it leaving. Negative campaigning doesn't work well in Scotland. It doesn't help the unionist cause that Labour and the Lib Dems are on the status quo/unionist side either, especially when they've campaigned in Scotland and filled their literature with stuff in favour of a maximum devolution option. In most if not all of Scotland, Conservatives = bad so being on their side doesn't help things. Ruth Davidson (leader of Scottish Labour) the presumed face of the campaign is unlikable also. All this helps to create an underdog dynamic where it's three against one which appeals to a lot of people. They need to stop talking about it being illegal or unconstitutional, that's not helping and just bolsterer support for the independence campaign. Certain newspapers are hurting the cause, but I don't think anything can be done by the unionist campaign about them.

In theory we'd be entitled to 8.4% of the armed forces and equipment though that proportion is subject to change based on negotiations. Stuff like share of any debt, whether we let the trident submarines remain in Scotland for the next ten years etc. So Scotland may relinquish our claim to some embassies in exchange for lower debt or whatever. The current plan is to keep the Queen/Windsor family as the heads of state. As for currency I'm sure most would like to join the Euro it's just bad luck that it's in a bad state right now, there's an argument to be made that Scotland helped create pound and keep it strong so should be allowed to continue using it but failing that there are lots of countries that use USD that have no support from the US and buy the currency from other countries. It's all very complicated and will probably take a good 5 to 10 years to sort out assuming a 'Yes' result.

Alec Salmond is perceived as a good debater and a canny politician by most people in Scotland and his government has done well. Every time some MP, Lord or media pundit compares him to a dictator or throws out personal insults they're just helping him and the SNP. There's a bit of the backlash against the UK media in Scotland right now actually because of stuff like this.

true,Lady_Jane_Grey,silence,Silence,"Here's what I did, and what you probably should not do: I watched ""An Unearthly Child"" and ""The Daleks,"" the 1st and 2nd episodes ever. Then, because it was near Christmas, I watched a small documentary about the show (where I became familiar with the Ponds). Then I watched some compilation videos on YouTube. Then I watched the Series 6 finale and the Christmas special, which was interesting because I had no idea what the fuck was going on. Then I started with Series 5 and went through Series 6 again, reading the massive amount of Wikipedia information as I went - because again, I had no idea what the fuck was going on. Then I made a U-turn back to Series 1 and now I'm almost done with Series 3. Most of my knowledge of the show comes from the revival and from Wikipedia. I think when I get done with Series 4, I'll either a) re-watch 5 and 6, b) pick up where I left off with William Hartnell, or c) start with Tom Baker. 

So yeah. Don't do what I did. 

But here's the moral to the story: I probably took the worst possible route possible (aside from maybe starting with the last season of the original show), but in the couple of months since I discovered the show, I've become an absolute die-hard Whovian. I think that wherever you start, as long as you're not afraid to utilize the Internet for filling in holes, you will absolutely love it. I don't know anyone who hasn't. Good luck (and don't blink).

Yeah, the aliens are silly, but ""Harriet Jones, Flydale North"" is worth the price of admission. :) The best is coming up after that.

It's certainly possible - many, many characters have been re-introduced from the classic series, and new fans have been all over them. Susan would be a bit different, though. Since ""Rose"" (the episode), we've been told time and time again that the Doctor is a loner, he's got no one else, this, that, the other. Bringing his granddaughter, his offspring, his flesh and blood back into the picture would require some very careful storytelling. It could be done well, though.

We're presented with two options really.  She really was his granddaughter in a biological sense, or she was just a human that he picked up and she called him grandfather.

If it's option one then yes in theory she could come back played by a different actress, however she also can't because any and all time lords were done away with in the time war.  We know there are absolutely none left because as the Doctor says ""he would know"".  Now there have been two ways around that we've seen.  Chameleon arc yourself so that you weren't technically a time lord at the time, or hide in the bubble universe sticking to the bigger universe (not really, but if it helps) from the doctor's wife.

We've already done the whole bubble universe thing so I don't see them going back to that.  Same with the Chameleon arc.  It would also bring up a whole ton of issues such as are they going to try and repopulate the species, and if so isn't that incest?  It would get ugly to say the least.

Now, if she wasn't a time lord we get more interesting.  You could have her played by the same actress.  The Doctor now young going back to see her as a grandmother.  Role reversal and all that.  But I don't see this as likely for two reasons.  

1) she certainly seems to be a time lord to me.  She's got the knowledge, she can describe the planet by heart, and so on.  Hell she named the TARDIS for the whole species apparently.

2) We kinda did this with Sarah Jane.  Yeah it was cool, but do you really want to go back to that well?  Why not Ian and Barbara then?  Why not all the old companions?

The problem comes from the term ""time-lord"".  It's used both to describe the species that lived on Gallifrey and to describe this ""higher class"", and we never really get a very accurate distinction.  Collectively the humanoids of Gallifrey were the ""time lords"" as we are ""humans"".  

My take is the entire species is gone completely.  The planet, every last genetic trace other than the Doctor and those who avoided the fall based on the two situations I've mentioned before.

The implication that the original series can't create fans is not only asinine, but patently false on the face of it. Fandom endured for sixteen years with but a single new episode; in many ways it *grew* during that period, with new fans discovering the classics.

Now let's put your straw man to the side for a moment, because I said nothing about starting with Hartnell. I just pointed out it had great writing, and people with attention spans could easily become fans. Right now on AICN there's a weekly installment of a new fan working his way through the Hartnell era, and he's enjoying it. Personally I would advise starting with series five of the current show, because there's a high cheese factor during the RTD period (which I love anyway).

&gt;Is this some sort of Doctor Who fandom elitism or something? Even Eccleston starts off fairly cheesy and can be a hard sell to new people.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

And even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor.

There's nothing *offensive* about only watching one Doctor.

Rights.  His 'rights' trump everything. If I was taking someone shopping and they wanted to blow their entire budget on chocolate ice cream - I could advise against it, but I couldn't actually stop them since it would be against their 'rights'

Similarly with this guy - his carers can advise that 8 hotdogs for breakfast and 2 roast dinners probably isn't what his dietician want him to eat, but at the end of the day as a carer they can't dictate what he can/can't eat because it would be (believe it or not) classed as abuse if they dicated his meals.

Even when I worked in forensic Mental health, there was a limit to what we could dicate a patient could/couldn't do.  We couldn't even stop a patient with diabetes from eating too much chocolate because that would have been abusing his 'rights'. (fucked up I know).  All we could do was 'advise' him not to - ultimately fucking useless if they don't want to listen.

We had a patient who was a convicted pedophile, who used to sit in his room and whack off while watching kids TV... and there was fuck all we could do about it - masturbating was a human right, and technically nothing illegal was  happening.

School is school, I can't really compare them because I don't really know anything about the US schooling system. We have 'Years' of school, Year 1 starts at age 6, and year 11 is age 16.

The US has the first amendment, we have an established church. 26 bishops sit in the House of Lords, and collective worship is mandatory in state schools. We are also one of the most secular countries in the EU. Forced prayer may have something to do with this. Like a smallpox vaccine, it seems a little dose given to us as children stops us catching the real thing as adults.
If there is one thing that really makes us stand out, it's the way we go on and on about the bloody weather. And we love to complain. About anything. And everything. And then move on and find something else to whinge about.

No, I am *clarifying* their fandom. Let me give you another example, since you don't like the two you've already gotten. I like Dennis Farina, so when he was on Law &amp; Order I tuned in every week. I watch those episodes when I catch them on repeats. During that season, I would sometimes casually describe myself as a fan of Law &amp; Order.

But in reality I wasn't a fan of Law &amp; Order. I was a fan of Dennis Farina *on* Law &amp; Order, and that's a different thing. I didn't watch Law &amp; Order before he joined, and I didn't watch it after he left. I wasn't a fan of **the show itself.**

Now let's bring this closer to home. My wife's mom loves David Tennant. She's watched his Doctor Who episodes three or four times each. She doesn't give a damn about Christopher Eccleston or Matt Smith. She won't watch their episodes. And the original series? Forget about it. So she isn't really a fan of Doctor Who; she's a fan of David Tennant *in* Doctor Who. That's a different thing.

Where you trip up is ascribing a value judgment to these two different positions.

Also, what are the major parties like in the government? Since i'm studying government now, this interests me greatly, and i wonder how different it is from our two party system.

Cameron and Blair are ideologically a lot closer than their traditional party positions would make it appear. Cameron is somewhat towards the left of a largely right wing party, while Blair was very much to the right of a traditionally left wing party, both occupy the center ground, while sometimes being more left wing or right wing than the other depending on the issue at question.

As for the guy in the OP's story - my solution would be to first give the guy a chance.  Dietician to come up with a realistic diet for him that he must stick to - I know you can't just suddenly drop his intake to a couple of salads as that would be dangerous but a realistic but strict gradual drop in calories, he must also sign a contract stating as such (promising no takeaway deliveries etc).

If he doesn't stick to it, or refuses to even try in the first place - then for his own good I would say he should be sectioned under the Mental Health act as he is unable to look after himself mentally &amp; physically.  Strict diet in a mental hospital would probably require a special court order but not impossible - in a hospital exercise in a pool would be good too since he could start earlier than normal exercise with the water supporting some of his weight, even if he's sitting in a hoist and just moving his legs around.

At the moment the guy is at the lowest he has ever been, he's crippled, lonely, depressed, most likely doesn't care if he lives or dies,  and probably not more than 5-10 years at most from death.

If your in hospital for lung cancer or some other medical issue that is a direct result of smoking then I would say that is the point to take the fags away. And if you discharge yourself to smoke then there is an argument for no longer providing treatment for the cancer (etc), and simply having your care restricted to pain management. Also, if your smoking somewhere it is illegal to smoke then that's a good time as well.

When the master dies, his old wounds from the time war are ripped open again and you can see how he recoils in season 4, and learning that martha loved him didn't do him any good. Donna helps him to come back to his social life and begin to accept his larger role in the universe. Its at right about this time that river shows up, and introduces the seed that begins his change from an old man who survived the time war to a young man with hope for the future. When he gets his whole entourage together to drag the earth back we see in a lot of ways how much the doctor has healed since he first met rose. But that he loses Donna makes it a bitter sweet conclusion. It all comes to a head when he sends gallifrey back into the timelock, repeating the act that broke him so long ago. At this point he can accept that he did the right thing and he can finally begin to really move on, and that is where 11 picks up.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Wow, that's a lot of questions! I'll do my best:  

* In my area (the south east, outside of London) we don't see many tourists. The American tourists I have seen have generally been ok, although they can be a little loud and aren't too considerate of the people who live where they are visiting.  

*  Most people tend to like the President, although very few think we should change our system so we have one too.  

*  As for American culture, people here don't seem to see America as a very cultured place. You have spray-on cheese, for Christ's sake. And as for Christ, people I think see America as an extremely religious place.  
 
*  We are fairly ethnically diverse, but just like America it depends where you go. The issue of immigration is hotly discussed, and whilst on TV and in papers it isn't common for this view to be shown, I think most people are anti-immigration and anti-immigrant.  

*  You are by no means unique in how diverse you are. Some primary (age 5-11) schools in London have over 100 languages spoken by students, which is one of the reasons people are anti-immigration - they see a great deal of immigrants come in, make no effort to learn English or integrate, and they end up ""taking over"" entire areas.  

*  Whilst the  between races in cities are far less common here, we do here about racially-motivated attacks. We also here about ""honour killings"" by traditionally Muslim families when their westernised children marry other races.  

*  [At this point, it probably makes sense for you to read up on our political system a bit.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_Kingdom)  

*  For most of the 20^th century, Labour were the traditional Leftist party in the UK, as it was formed by the unions and other groups organising themselves together into a party. The Conservatives (or ""Tories"") have always been the traditional right-wing party, representing the middle and, particularly, upper classes. However, when Blair became leader of the Labour party (in the 1990's) he moved the party towards the centre hoping to gain more votes, particularly from the middle classes. This worked well, and Blair's so-called ""New Labour"" (the name given to his modernised version of the party) won two landslide victories in the 1997 and 2001 elections.  

*  In response to this, when David Cameron was made leader of the Conservative party in 2005, he moved his party towards the centre, to a lesser extent. He also tried to modernise his party, in an attempt to win the young vote.  

*  In the 2010 election, Cameron's Conservatives won the election. This means they won the most constituencies - this is kind of like the electoral college system in the US, except each area (constituency) votes for a representative of a party. Then, this representative becomes a Member of Parliament (MP). The party with the most seats (MPs sitting in Parliament) becomes the ruling party, and that party's leader becomes Prime Minister.  

*  However, a very unusual result happened in 2010. There are 650 seats, and the Conservatives won 306. Whilst this is bigger than Labour's 242, it is not a majority. This means that it is far more difficult for them to pass legislation, and rule in general. So they formed a coalition with the third biggest party - the Liberal Democrats (57 seats). The LibDem's leader, Nick Clegg, became deputy Prime Minister, and they pooled their seats together to have a majority.  

*  Due to being in a coalition, Cameron cannot fully implement his policies. This means that those who supported him now are annoyed with his lack of impact, and those who opposed him still don't like what he has managed to do. Meanwhile, Labour have appointed a leader (who becomes Leader of the Opposition - the biggest party not in power) who many see as weak and I personally find hilarious - Ed Milliband. It's his job to generally argue with the Coalition's policies and try to stop them winning votes in the House of Commons (our version of the senate, kind of).

true,impablomations,northumberland,Northumberland,"&gt;There's no ""90 days notice"" of going into administration. If a company is failing, it won't finally fall apart in three months.

Wrong.  When an employer proposes to dismiss as redundant 20 or more staff within 90 days they are under a duty to consult with them or their representatives. They cannot get round this even if the insolvency is very sudden. If they don’t consult, the employer will be liable to pay each affected employee compensation of up to 90 days’ pay.

If there is a recognised union at the workplace, then the employer also has to consult with the trade union. If they don’t, then the union can bring a claim for a protective award. Once an award has been made, the individual employee has to lodge a tribunal claim in their own name in order to enforce it. Payment can then be claimed through the RPO and the insolvency arrangements.

true,theclaaaaaaw,uk,The King in the North,"British politics is very similar to US politics in several ways. Firstly, American politics is partly based on the old British political system.

The President is similar to how the King/Queen used to be and the Speaker of the house is the same as our Prime Minister. We don't quite have a two party system. Although we have only 2 parties that are actually likely to be elected to government, we currently have 10 parties represented in Parliament. 

This is mainly because Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland all have their own parties that represent only them. These parties then get elected to Parliament. However, some smaller parties, most notably since 2010 the Green party, also have seats. 


In terms of ideology, far right wing views in British politics tend to sit at about the centre right point in US politics. Abortion, evolution in schools,  and the death penalty are all non issues here. Instead, the biggest issues the concern people are actually similar to other US problems. Immigration and Healthcare. David Cameron is right wing by our standards, but by American standards, he isn't much further right than Obama. In fact, on some issues, Obama is probably more right wing. 

In terms of government parties, the two electable parties I mentioned earlier are Labour, the main left wing party and the Conservative party, the main right wing party. Both parties are more or less competent. However, both have toxic images that they can't shake off. Labour were in power when the global recession began and people blame them for the problems that have resulted. The Conservatives cannot shake off the idea that they are a party of rich elites who don't care about the poor. This problem sticks around because of the love of Margaret Thatcher, who was a Conservative Prime Minister and very unpopular among many people, by many members of the party. These problems led to the 2010 election, where no party won more than 50% of the vote. Therefore, the Conservatives, who won the most seats, were forced to form a coalition Government with the Liberal Democratic party, a left wing party that is pretty much a party that people just vote for when they don't like Labour or the Conservatives. Coalitions are a new thing here, so there have been lots of problems and people generally see the Liberal Democrats as having been neutered by the Conservatives. Policies that the Lib Dems oppose have been passed because the Lib Dems have been forced into agreeing to support them.

____

&gt;Are you fond of American tourists?

No but I am not fond of any tourists, why would I be?. The money is great for the economy though

&gt;What do you think of our president...


I always felt Obama was Anti-British, I also think his is a coward who never did what he said he was going to do. Specifically breaking his word at times.

&gt;How ethnically diverse is it?

It is quite diverse. South-Asians are the biggest minority. Although Mixed Race will overtake them soon.

&gt;Do you deal with any racism?


As much as any other developed nation really. I would put us lower on the scale than most of Continental Europe though. 

The UK holds multiculturalism to the highest order and while Racism exists within the fabric of individual groups and communities: it is not tolerated.

&gt;What is politics like in the UK? 


Participation is a bit low. The Party Whip is arguably too strong. Still, the UK has a good set of varied politics.

David Cameron is Right-Wing but to be honest, the UK is generally  Moderate and in the Middle of the Political Spectrum. David Cameron will probably be christened a Socialist by American Standards.


&gt;What is school like?


Britain was once a world leader in education. It has declined a lot but is still relatively good. It has had a lot of troubles recently and will probably need to be reformed to get back on track.

School is mandatory between the ages of 4 - 16. After that you can choose to continue on for an additional two years or go off and do other forms of education. You must stay in education until 18 (although this is a recent law).


Schools are held to a National Curriculum and Britain is heavily Exam Focused.

I honestly don't believe your two party system is a very democratic system and that the multiple parties of the U.K. gives much more freedom to the public.

* Education: Every comment I've read so far mentioning education has failed to point out that Northern Ireland and Scotland have separate education systems from England and Wales. I know nothing of N.I.'s education system but I'm currently in Scotland's (out of compulsory education though) and from what I've heard from teachers and in the news the Scottish education system is much better than the English/Welsh. In Scotland you can go to nursery (kindergarten) from any age - about 5 or 6. You then go into primary education for 7 years (each year is known as P1, P2, P3, etc.) which teaches you basic skills like addition, multiplication, division, poetry, story writing, typing, drama etc. you then go on to secondary school. Here you must do 4 years of education (or 5 if you haven't turned 16 by the time 5th year starts) and you can then do an additional 2 if you so wish. In the first 4 years you're studying for exams called Standard Grades (or Intermediates as they seem to be getting changed to) which are roughly equivalent to the English/Welsh GCSE. If you chose to do a 5th year generally you're doing it to gain Highers which are between the English GCSE and A-Level and then if you chose to do the 6th year you usually either do Advanced Highers (English A-Level) or more Highers.
 
After secondary education you can either go on to college or university (very separate things, unlike in America). College is generally a more vocational based learning environment where as university can be vocational but is often not. University is harder to get into than college but many colleges are linked to universities and do schemes like if you do 2 years at the college you can automatically gain entry into the 3rd year of a university course (what I'm currently in the process of doing).

true,[deleted],null,null,"Most of your questions have been answered, but I thought I'd chime-in too -- not wanting to be left out.

**Are you fond of American tourists?**
I often find American tourists to be friendly, but ignorant. They also have an expectation of customer service which just doesn't exist in most of the UK. Although that's getting better (read: more Americanised, ""Have a nice day!!"").

**What do you think of our president **
Of the office: a rallying point for Americans to claim bragging rights, with a lot of influence and patronage (people who owe him their jobs), but no real day-to-day power. Of the man: Obama seems to be sincere in his efforts to make America a fairer society. I think he's an intellectual, and probably the best man to be president in the next term.

**or our culture?**
American culture is so pervasive, it's almost difficult to tell where it ends and our own begins; especially since we have a shared history. American history is basically British history too, although we don't really teach it as such. From what I've seen, a lot of Americans take themselves very seriously which is at odds with the British (and especially Scottish) tenancy to be self-deprecating. Religion isn't nearly as important in the UK also, even among the religious.

**How ethnically diverse is it? **
By the last census count the entire UK had around 8% non-white, and Scotland had around 5% non-whites. Mainly based in larger cities. This will have surely increased by now, but we won't know until the 2011 census results are published. 

**What's the politics like?**
We have a Bi-cameral legislature. The lower chamber is the elected House of Commons and the upper chamber is the appointed House of Lords. The Commons has 650 Members of Parliament (MPs), who are elected to represent their constituencies. The Prime Minister and most of his cabinet reside in the Commons.  The Lords contains 800+ members who are selected by the government of the day (in the Commons) for their expertise and experience, they can serve on government but do not in great numbers as they do not have democratic accountability.

The UK also has 3 devolved parliaments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. One for England was suggested, but ultimately rejected as it would represent 85% of the UK's population and therefore be a challenger to the UK Parliament. The main issue in Scotland right now is independence -- whether to succeed from the 300 year old union with England. A referendum is planned for 2015.

**What are the major parties like in the government?**
The general rule is that Labour should be trusted with schools and hospitals. And The Conservatives with policing and defence. The Lib Dems (3rd party) will promise anything to get votes as they have never - until now - been in government and had to actually implement any promises. Right now we have a coalition government between the Conservatives and the Lib Dems, although this is a novelty. The First Past the Post voting system usually produces a clear majority.

**What is school like?**
School is a devolved issue so it is different in each part of the UK. In Scotland, Primary School age is 4/5yrs-12yrs. Secondary 12/13yrs - 18yrs. University education is free to all Scottish people (and people within the EU), which is a bone of contention with our southern neighbours as they have fee rises incoming at the moment, and do not get free education in Scotland due to a legal anomaly. 

**One more thing**
One thing I would say. American people are cool, I - on the whole - like them. But our governments are not friends. We certainly do not have the ""special relationship"" that Churchill wanted so badly. It is, at best, a relationship of convenience.

She was then appointed to be Shadow Minister for Community Cohesion (a position she was the first person to occupy), then made a life peer etc.

So it seems she sits pontificating and generally being angry with the UK as it becomes less and less religious, from a position of authority I'm not entirely sure she deserves. At least she doesn't deserve to be so frickin' vocal, particularly not when she's talking bollocks.

This sort of survey and result make me wonder why such leaders, in particular, feel the need to contradict the general feeling and often state quite the reverse, but still attribute it to everyone else too. My only guess is that any shift towards a more tolerant, equal society - such as it seems that most people are in favour of - is being resisted as it would eventually lead to their acknowledging that their religion/faith isn't that important or relevant to many people. Follow the twisty road of thought and we can conclude that that sort of acknowledgment could in turn eventually lead us to the disestablishment of the CoE.

The reason that faiths other than the CoE rally round them is because, I think, of the adage: ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"".

3rd party security firms are already doing a lot of custodial work including finger printing, photographing &amp; videoing.

They don't have the power to search and can only proceed with the detainee's permission.

A police custody sergeant is required to be present in the custody suite at all times and anyone making a half reasonable request to speak to him/her is allowed to so do.

If someone is arrested then it's the job of the arresting officer to ensure that the detainee is processed... i.e. if the detainee is being a dick and refusing to be searched, the arresting officer will have to stay and assist the security guys.

While I'm certainly not saying this is a Good Thing, the last time I was in the custody block (recently, as an appropriate adult) I saw around 50/50 police/security mix and found them all to be pleasant, respectful, patient and polite... and with a good sense of humour too.

So long as we don't give the security guys the same powers as the police officers I don't see much of a problem here.

true,Feint1,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,"&gt;our two countries are strong political allies and friends

You wouldn't think so with some remarks made by Obama.

&gt;Are you fond of American tourists?

I don't see tourists unless I am one myself. But I definitely have a prejudiced against Americans compared to other groups. They're quit arrogant and loud.

&gt;What do you think of... our culture?

I don't like it.

&gt;How ethnically diverse is it?

Depends, if you go to a rural area it's all white British. If you go to Birmingham you will think you're in the Punjab.

&gt;Do you deal with any racism?

No, I don't witness any, but it does exist.

&gt;My country is unique in the fact that we have so many different races

America isn't unique in the slightest. The United Kingdom has a grand colonial history, making it one of the most diverse places on earth.

Luckily there has been a greater effort to stop immigration compared to countries like France, which have major problems stemming from immigration.

&gt;What is politics like in the UK?

Shite

&gt;know David Cameron has only become the PM recently, and has a more conservative or republican view than say Tony Blair, but i wondered if Cameron would seem very left leaning compared to the extreme views that some Americans can have.

The United Kingdom is a monarchy. Republican doesn't mean what you think it means.

I wouldn't say Cameron was particularly left-wing. There is much more than right or left politics, Americans seem to get too tied up in whether you are socially liberal or socially conservative. Hence why you have people accusing Obama of being a Muslim and an Atheist for simply being more socially liberal than most Americans. The concept of individual opinions are completely lost on these people.

&gt;Also, what are the major parties like in the government? Since i'm studying government now, this interests me greatly, and i wonder how different it is from our two party system.

Conservatives: Attempt to be different to Labour with a slight pro-rich undertone.

Labour: I don't even know any more, old Labour was about the working man.

Liberal Democrats: A party for university students and web designers. Only got seats because of tactical voting.

UKIP: Want to keep Britain British

Greens: People who like to recycle their faeces

BNP: Racists and old people

SNP: Sottish nationalists

DUP: Northern Irish unionists

&gt;What is school like?

You wear a posh uniform and get into punch ups for fun. Other than that it's the same as everywhere else.

&gt;When do kids get off, or when do they go to school?

9:00-3:30, Monday to Friday

&gt;What is required in school?

-I apologize for our disrespectful tourists. I agree, Americans can be quite loud and obnoxious =(

-A lot of people like the president here too, however I feel that there a probably more people in Europe in general who would look more fondly on him than here in the US because we have very extreme right winged views on politics, some i agree with, and some that are completely ridiculous.

-You are probably right that we are not that cultured, but I did mention in a previous post that most people hold on to culture from the country they came from originally. Also, in regards to religion, I believe that it really depends on where you live in the US. There ARE incredibly religious people, but in the northeast where I live, it is much more left leaning, and religion is not very prevalent.

-The immigration ideas surprise me. I had no idea that the UK was mostly anti-immigration. This is probably one of our biggest differences, since both parties are strongly for immigration in the United States, as long as it's legal.

-We sort of have a similar situation with Latino communities, however, most Americans look fondly on them where I am from and they do learn English and integrate into the US. There are of course groups who oppose immigrants too and believe they cause crime and things like that, which i personally think is hypocritical since most Americans were originally immigrants anyway :/

-We also have racially motivated actions, especially in the south. Unfortunately, racism is still quite prevalent in some parts here.

-I will definitely read up so I don't embarrass myself and look ignorant in the future =)

-This topic is one of the most interesting to me, because it's interesting to see how having more than 2 parties creates completely different conflicts.  The labor party and the conservatives do sound quite similar to our democrat and republican parties though. but i'm sure our conservatives are MUCH more extreme than yours ;)

-I didn't realize that David Cameron wasn't actually elected seperately! Shows how ignorant I am, i apologize :/. But we also have  ""Constituency"" system of sorts. The people are considered constituents, and we have elections every 2 years in small local areas for house of representative members, and state elections for senators. Unlike the UK however, our president is not always reflective of the majority of our congress, which can cause gridlock, which we have now. Hopefully I'm not being annoying by explaining something you already knew, just wanted to be able to put input in as well =)

I've helped a confused, dottering old lady when it was a cold night back to her house when I was a teenager. She didn't know where she lived and was walking up and down a street close to my home. Everyone who I was with didn't seem to care, so I went over and talked to her. We walked further up the street and I asked her who she was, where she lived, who she lived with, what day she thought it was, etc. She was clearly demented, and it broke my heart. Luckily she eventually pointed out a house she thought was her home, we knocked on and it turned out she did live there, so not too bad of a result.

In October I stopped a kid from getting jumped. This one was even fucking worse. Seriously. Some poor kid on a paper round was being chased by three other kids, ther were all about 14. Anyway, this was on a dual carriageway, a packed dual carriageway. Cars were nose to arse and there was easily over 50 people who could see what was going on. They caught him, knocked him down and started booting the poor little fucker in the head. I run down the road, across the street yelling at these little shits to get off him. They scatter when I get close. Anyway, this little kids lying there bumps and cuts all over his face, busted lip, busted nose crying his fucking eyes out saying 'thank you, thank you'. I try to calm him down, take him to the shop where he does his paper round and explain the situation to his employer and leave. Aint seen the kid since but I hope if he clocks me he'll come over and say hello, I'd like to see him with a smile on his face.

Adam ahead of Spearing is ridiculous. Spearing is the only player we have that resembles a CDM. Would you prefer to waste Gerrard in that role for the sake of Adam? You cray. 

Furthermore, Spearing has played excellent defense since Lucas' injury. Even in the Spurs game where he struggled in the offensive phase, he played excellent ahead of Skrtel and Agger.

But Spearing did have a bad game. It was a big stage, perhaps the pressure got to him. Also, the way Giggs and Rooney set up on either side of him made his job very difficult (see the zonal marking article on this).

Funny enough, the real mistake was not starting Carroll against De Gea/Evans/Ferdinand.

For me, assuming Bellers didn't get the start because he needed to rest those knees, I would have gone 4-3-3:

Gerrard(RAM) Spearing(CDM) Hendo(LAM)

In terms of placebo, it's possible that prayer could help, particularly - or should I say only - on a personally basis.

true,widgetas,null,null,"When it comes to ""God bless America"" and more often the chants of ""USA! USA! USA!"", particularly at sporting events, I think to myself ""Who are you talking to?"" I've heard it said in numerous places that America is very ""young"". That's not to be patronising, but consider a young man's attempts to make himself big and important. He has to *tell* everyone how frickin' awesome he is, flexing his muscles and strutting about.

I can't think of many other countries in the world which posture so much. I'm not sure of many other nations that have inhabitants who say ""This is *the* greatest country in the world!"" While they might think it, or prefer their country to others (particularly if they've actually been abroad) I'm not sure there are that many people who would say it outright and so categorically. (There are likely some, but I can't think of one straight away).

The same applies to flags on many buildings and especially outside people's homes. For whatever reason it seems that quite often Americans aren't that well travelled (and I don't mean inter-state) so it makes absolutely no sense to me that someone will love and adore their country so much that they will hang the cloth outside all the time. Again - who are you talking to/showing?

However, it's perfectly possibly that much of the patriotism is Americans being *told* they love their country. I see a similar thing here - Consider how much time has been spent recently on the jubilee. A special occasion, granted, but it's not unusual *anyway* for the royals to be spoken of in deferential tones by the media (I'm looking at you, BBC) and again I find I'm often being told how important the royals are to us all.

Further on the subject of patriotism, speaking directly to OP (as much of the above is too), I don't know about anyone else here, but I think they'll agree: Getting your children to mindlessly drone the pledge of allegiance to a flag every morning is... creepy and rather disturbing. It's no different to *insert evil foreign religious dictatorship here* and the way they indoctrinate their kids.

I do see positives to the US, of course, and will probably expand upon them a bit later on. Apols for appearing so negative :D

He's the one who seems most natural in the role. His episodes may drag a bit in comparison to the newer series, however it certainly gives characters more time to develop.

Plus you have the Whomobile ""Bessie"", his outfits, and Venusian Aikido.

All the Doctors I've seen suffer from their fair share of bad episodes though. 

Nine suffered from the Siltheen episodes.

Ten suffered from some pretty shoddy writing at times. Love &amp; Monsters (not even ELO could save that) and Fear Her come to mind. 

I'm not sure what to fully think about Eleven yet considering his run isn't over. However, the paradoxes can only be written off for so long as ""wibbly wobbly timey wimey."" Plus the writing hasn't always been that great. I'm also not a huge fan of River Song (bit of a Mary Sue IMO).

Overall though, I enjoy watching all four of them go around saving the universe. All four of them feel like they certain belong in the role. However, I'm not going to just simply say ""The Doctor"" which is a popular answer.

And by dark Time Lord power, I mean that during the seventh Doctor's reign you got the feeling that while the seventh seems like a goofy dusty professor on the outside, sometimes you can tell there's an undercurrent of something. This something is alien, it's terrifying, and it's dangerous.

However, it's different from the godlike awe I get from the tenth Doctor. This is where it gets hard to explain. The tenth Doctor's godlike-ness, in my opinion, relates to his vanity. Both are very unique to the tenth Doctor unlike the shallow narcissism of the sixth or fourth.

Whereas the tenth Doctor makes you think that he is some kind of lonely god high above us who lives in another plane, the seventh Doctor feels more like a pervasive sense of otherness. Dark otherness. It's not above or below us, it's just *other*. Unknown.

Also, it's not Dr. Who, (sorry had to say it, as it kills me when people put Dr.) it is Doctor Who. Just a friendly heads up.

true,redem,null,null,"I'm from Northern Ireland, part of the UK but not... eh details aren't so important, it should suffice to say some things are different here from the rest of the UK.

&gt; Are you fond of American tourists?

They're alright. Mostly you only ever hear the loud and annoying tourists, and those seem invariably American. Probably some significant degree of confirmation bias combined with the culture shock many Americans seem to experience here, though. Something European tourists don't have to deal with.

&gt; What do you think of our president or our culture? 

Obama was by far the best candidate, and certainly he was the only one that seemed at all competent. Pity he inherited a recession, really. I do not envy him that.

Culture, eh, no comment.

&gt; How ethnically diverse is it? I've never left my country, but still, even leaving my state of New Jersey and going to someplace else like Texas has HUGE differences and opinions.

Texas isn't hugely ethnically different from NJ to my knowledge. Regardless, the UK is quite ethnically diverse. The wages of the Empire, immigrants from all over the former colonies came to the UK as well as the UK itself being a combination of a number of different countries. That remains to this day as a commonwealth visa is relatively easy to obtain (compared to other sorts) so that people from commonwealth countries often emigrate to the UK (and vice versa), and we're in the EU so we get a great many people coming to and from the continent.

It is impossible to think of the UK as any sort of homogeneous cultural of ethnic group. The movements against this multiculturalist society are generally disregarded, people like the BNP. Scummy bastards that they are.

&gt; Do you deal with any racism? I've always wondered what people in different countries feel about different races.

Ehm, I won't speak of the UK as a whole, as for NI. It's a pretty significant issue but limited to between the communities that see themselves as Irish and British. Fun times. :)

&gt; What is politics like in the UK? I know David Cameron has only become the PM recently, and has a more conservative or republican view than say Tony Blair, but i wondered if Cameron would seem very left leaning compared to the extreme views that some Americans can have. Also, what are the major parties like in the government? Since i'm studying government now, this interests me greatly, and i wonder how different it is from our two party system.

In NI, our politics is very much tribal. People vote for the parties that further the interests of their ""community"", which boils down to either Unionist or Republican (completely unrelated to what the term means in US politics) parties. As such there is very little in the way of interesting political arguments going on, it's all tribal bullshit.

The UK as a whole, there are far fewer elections. People vote for their local MPs, and that's about it. The party with the majority of these in parliament forms the government and the prime-minister is appointed by them. There are two major parties, one minor party that plays a non-trivial role, and a host of random local parties that no one cares about unless they hold the swing vote. So, not a two party system like the US, but something that's pretty close.

&gt; What is school like? I've always wondered this, but I am completely ignorant to how your school system works. I'm sure it is much similar (and probably better) than the US, but how exactly does it work? When do kids get off, or when do they go to school? What is required in school? etc... Please feel free to tell me anything else you love or hate about the UK if it doesn't trouble you, i would be very interested to hear about anything you have to say! I'll also answer any question regarding the United States if you're curious as well :D. Thanks!

Ehm, I have little to base a comparison on. School is mandatory from age 5 to age 16, the majority of kids go on for another 2 years at least in various training or education programs and I think about half go on to university or some other form tertiary education. Quality wise, we're something like middle of the pack among wealthy nations depending on how you want to measure that. It's a complex issue, so I don't think you can really make simplistic judgements without signficant caveats. The US doesn't do too badly by many measures, either.

The [NAO](http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0203/international_education_compar.aspx) reports compare many facets, but of course there are many more ways to measure such things.

Hmmmm.... Lots of Western countries are equally, or more multicultural than the USA - eg. Australia. Turns out according to [this study](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-11-17/australia-second-most-multicultural-country/2339884), Luxembourg is the most multicultural country! 

In answer to some of your questions.... David Cameron is probably similar in politics to Obama - probably more left on some issues, in fact. For example, both parties in the UK support the current system of civil partnerships for gay couples and Cameron wants to introduce gay marriage. Whilst you guys have 2 major parties, I wouldn't characterise either of them as left-wing - just super-right wing and centre-right. 

There is a coalition govt here at the moment - neither Labor nor the Conservatives won a majority at the last election. The Liberal Democrats, though sharing much more politically with Labour than the Conservatives, formed a coalition with the conservatives. I think this is mostly because although the Conservatives didn't win the election, Labour definitely lost it, and the Lib Dems didn't want to prop up Gordon Brown who was wildly unpopular. Anyway, the Lib Dems sided with Cameron and won some policy concessions... but annoyed their cote constituency by backtracking on a number of key issues such as raising university fees (now amongst the highest in the world). 
Cameron and co have been doing a range of things to education - some OK, some terrible. His education minister Michael Gove holds the current system in contempt and has been making very rapid changes. For example, we had a limited number of academies here - kindof like charter schools. These were generally failed schools in very poor areas which were closed down, given masses of extra funding to rebuild and start again, and then hotspots for innovation and massively improved outcomes for students who needed it the most. Gove expanded this programme and allowed all schools with excellent ratings to convert to academy status (and thus, gain all sorts of freedoms such as not having to pay teachers properly, being able to use untrained teachers with little restriction, and the right to teach creationism!!). Instead of being sensible and a bit slower in order to expand the academy system well, it has gone a bit crazy here now. Gove has also implemented changes in the way that schools are externally ranked in league tables, and massively increased the value of taking the subjects he likes (history, latin, french, etc) whilst simultaneously devaluing newer subjects (technology, media studies, etc). Gove also decided it was necessary to spend public money on sending every school in the UK a bible - with a foreword by him, no less! Apparently this is because the Bible is a significant historical text useful for the study of literature... however every school receives numerous free bibles yearly already, and you can't actually study the bible readily in a lesson without a class set of them. So expensive, ideologically unsound and useless... and the foreword is just patronising. 
Here in schools, students 'graduate' at the end of Year 11, when they earn a certain number of GCSEs - certificates in the subjects they've taken. Then, they can either go to college and complete more vocational studies and apprenticeships, or they can go to a 6th form and complete A Level studies - more like first year uni. Some schools (comprehensives) are combined secondary and A Level schools. In 6th form, students only take 3 or 4 subjects and come and go from the campus in between lessons, or study privately. The idea is that students become more independent and self-sufficient before embarking on university studies.

The Republicans do nothing but lie about every single issue ever, and people buy into their religiously fueled hatred and bullshit. You have cops in your schools! Guns everywhere, more prisoners than the Soviet gulags, a high chance of becoming bankrupt or dying because of lack of healthcare. 

It terrifies me because the UK is often America's lap dog, and the Tories in power love to copy the worst ideas from the US, and that is why they are currently trying to sabotage our health service as well. But even having said that, the tories aren't quite as right wing as your politicians. Actually Cameron is probably around the same area as Obama. And I think Cameron is dangerously right wing. Any time someone calls Obama left wing I laugh. 

Religion is an interesting difference in our cultures. If a politician here claims to be talking to God we get very worried that he or she might be an insane person. The majority of people here are atheist or sort of nominally Christian. People say 'Oh I'm Christian' because they like the tradition and tradition is a big part of British identity. But if you press them they will often admit that they would never go to church and find a lot of the ideas in the bible outdated and hilarious. 

A lot of people don't even really think about god or religion at all, and you would certainly be very wary of bringing religion up as a topic of conversation.  I think American tourists are viewed as very sociable and gregarious because you will talk to anyone, but slightly rude because you don't know the British unspoken rules of what is polite to talk about and what isn't.  Safe topics to converse with strangers about are weather, how bad the buses/trains are, prices of things in shops going up, or local geography. And talking about the weather can actually be interesting, since our weather is very varied and unpredictable. But an American will come up to someone and tell them what they do for a living and what their kids names are, and to a Brit this seems like very unseemly boasting. 

You may be interested to know that America is barely mentioned in our schools. Our history lessons cover Ancient Rome, the Norman invasion of 1066, medieval knights, the Tudors and Stuarts, the British civil war, the agricultural and industrial revolutions, and then world war 1 and 2. The things I know about american history were solely from tv and reading on the internet. We don't give a shit about you or your civil war or your slaves, and we're a bit embarrassed about our own murderous colonial history, so we don't talk about that either. 

Hmm what else. Oh! Americans are REALLY missing out because of your lack of meat pies! There is nothing more delicious than a pie filled with chicken or steak and gravy. 

If you are really interested, I once read a fantastic book called [watching the english](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Watching-English-Hidden-Rules-Behaviour/dp/0340818867/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329210493&amp;sr=8-3) which is all about British culture and peculiarities.

Although UK debt is worryingly high, and higher as a % of GDP than Germany or France, it has the advantage that most of the bonds issued doesn't need to be refinanced this year.

Almost all the government borrowing this year is to fund running costs - not to repay old debt. Other countries are forced to not just borrow for 2012 costs, but also to repay debt incurred in previous years.

Therefore a ratings watch is looking ahead to 2013 when the UK needs to start repaying debt and that is when the bond markets will be most twitchy about the long term trends for the UK economy.

In the UK, schools are classified as ""state"" or ""independent"". State schools are funded by the state (taxation) and must follow certain curricula, meet certain standards etc, whereas independent schools are funded by fees and donations. These schools are broadly independent of government influence excluding welfare considerations etc.

However, independent schools may be referred to both as ""private"" or ""public"" schools. ""Public"" schools are so called as they were originally founded to educate members of the public, but they are still independent. There is also a certain poorly defined hierarchy in the independent sector whereby the quality and prestige of the school relates to whether it is referred to as independent, private, or public.

Public schools are a ""select group of about 10% of the independent schools in the country, which are in general older, traditional and members of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference."" [[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_school_%28United_Kingdom%29)] and include schools such as Eton, Winchester, St. Paul's, Harrow etc. These schools essentially provide the elite of society.

I don't know if the extent of our multiculturalism has anything to do with it either. So many people come from different walks of life so could be proud of their 'home' nation. Although I've heard the argument that American pride and God obsession have formed due to multiculturalism with the immigrants feeling they need to follow these two things to belong in society.

Also the people that really represent nationalism in our country aren't very nice people, so others don't like to look like they could be remotely associated with them.

true,drekthar,null,null,"&gt; How ethnically diverse is it?

I'd say very, but you're more likely to see it in larger cities and towns than in smaller towns and villages. I imagine there is some racism, because racism exists all over the world - however the general consensus is to live and let live and mind your own business. As a socially and politically ignorant person this is my take on the makeup of our ethnic groups: We have lots of people from India or with Indian roots since we used to colonise that country and it's part of the Commonwealth. We have lots of people from the Middle East, namely from Pakistan since that is or was also part of the Commonwealth. We've also got a large number of migrants from Eastern Europe, such as Poland. Then we have people from everywhere else in the world too, but likely in smaller numbers. I wouldn't be surprised to see a Maori person walking down the street, since we *are* a very ethnically diverse country.

Another way to put it is that when I went to university, white people were actually the *minority*. There was no majority though, we had mixings of everything.

It's commonly accepted that most rural areas in England are inhabited by old white people, however.

Our Conservative party is probably about the same as the US Democrat party, I'd brand the Conservative party as center-right. The tories aren't very popular because they've made some major cuts to public spending, hiked tuition fees and are trying to meddle with the National Health Service (NHS). We're kinda the opposite of America in that sense. ""Don't you touch our socialised healthcare, dang nabit!"" Religion doesn't tend to play a major role in our politics. For example, suggesting that we criminalise abortion would get a politician laughed out of the room.

Like the US we've traditionally had a 2 party system (Labour and Conservative) but the Liberal Democrats are the third largest. We recently had a ""hung parliament"" situation due to one party getting enough votes to form its own government, so now we have a coalition between the Lib Dems and the Conservatives. Labour grew very unpopular for a few reasons, such as going to war in Iraq and trying to turn the UK into a ""nanny state"" (e.g. the smoking ban where landlords cannot decide to allow patrons to smoke on their premises or not). They're also accused of nurturing a benefits culture where people who don't work live off of handouts from the government. People here do feel the need for a safety net if you're down on your luck which is why we have benefits, but they don't take kindly to people taking advantage of the system or ""sponging"" from the government. Basically, socialism but within reason.

&gt; What do you think of our president?

Personally I think Obama's okay. I don't like the fact that there are still Britons being held without charge in Guantanamo Bay. I'm also feeling a bit bitter towards the extradition treaty we hold with the US due to the fact that it's being used to possibly extradite a university student named Richard O'Dwyer for hosting TVshack which linked to copyrighted content, but overall I don't dislike America. I just don't like its government much. Americans as people are lovely.

&gt; What is school like?

When I went to school classes started at 8:35 and finished at 4:05. I went to an unusual school and other schools started at 9:00am and finished around 3:00pm to my knowledge. I took the bus to school but we had to pay a fee for it annually. At my school we didn't have things like detention and homework was optional, but again I think most British schools do have detention and homework.

&gt; Are you fond of American tourists?

I like Americans, they always seem so upbeat and cheerful. We don't get a lot of tourists around here since I live in a relatively small town that's far away from major tourist attractions like London, but we still have a few roaming around and I've never had an unpleasant experience talking to an American.

A few notable things about the UK are that we get whipped up into a frenzy during the world cup. The flags come out, the pubs overflow and there's a lot of drinking and singing. Football (soccer) is the absolute most popular sport here and most towns here will have a football club/stadium.

We also have a bit of a binge drinking epidemic going on. For example our town center has a portable ambulance parked between a cluster of pubs because inevitably, it will be needed. The streets are always patrolled by perhaps a hundred policemen because when you have hordes of drunk people going from pub to pub, it's likely that something's going to kick off. That's business as usual for every weekend. British people are renowned for being party animals, we have a reputation for it even abroad in places like Ibiza and Greece. It's common to see a headline in a newspaper stating that endemic alcohol usage has cost the NHS X amount of money this year. We like to drink.

As an ending point, some fun facts:

* Yes, fish and chip shops are everywhere. 
* We freak out and shut down everything if we get even 2 inches of snow.
* Trains are ludicrously expensive. Mention trains to any British person and expect a 2 hour tirade about how appalling it is.
* Most people are indifferent to the monarchy here, though I personally think the Queen seems like a nice old lady. I don't agree with her getting a £60 million yacht for her Diamond Jubilee, but hey.
* People who are on Jobseekers' Allowance can refer to it as being ""on the dole"", so if you ever hear that phrase, that's what it means. It's a small amount of living money given to you fortnightly by the gov't when you're currently seeking employment.
* British humour is undeniably the best in the world. Check out shows like Red Dwarf, Father Ted and Black Books. Also the IT Crowd. Another one I personally like (which is VERY British) is Keeping Up Appearances.
* Coca-Cola is the most popular drink in the UK, except in Scotland, where Irn Bru is the most popular. Scotland is the entire world's exception to the rule.
* We love to queue. Even when the riots took place, people queued up to loot the shops.

There are many bits of Wales where Welsh is spoken routinely. Gaelic is much rarer, and only has about 50,000 speakers in the Western Isles. Northern Ireland either looks pleasant if you travel through it, or worrying if you start decoding what all those pretty flags and murals are saying. Even in England, accents can be so strong as to be mutually unintelligible, e.g. Geordie and older Gloucestershire speaker.

American tourists: I tend to avoid London and Stratford, so I either meet Americans through work or in more out of the way places like the north of Scotland.

Religious adherence has been waning in the UK for decades and we've now got to the point where the non-religious are, at a conservative estimate, equal to the number of religious people. However, given the data I posted it would seem that 'proper' religious people - I think we can all agree (but I can guess at some who won't) that the majority of Christians in the UK are in no way religious in any real sense of the word - are now outnumbered greatly by non-religious and very non-practicing religious people.

However, the way in which the government has dealt with religious issues in the last decade or so tells an entirely different story. Of course since Blair left Number 10 we've come to understand the extent of exactly how much he relied on his faith and that it seems Alistair Campbell had to work quite hard to keep a lid on how much Blair really did ""do God"". It should be perfectly clear where Cameron stands on the issue: his recent claim that ""Britain is a Christian country"" as well as his policy towards faith schools etc. shouldn't leave anyone in any doubt as to his (and numerous people in his government) disregard for actual public feeling on the matter of how important (they think) religion is.

As a reference I'll cite Baroness Warsi: One annoying aspect of Warsi's bullshit that has been/will be spouted today is that many of her claims are utterly false in the first place, even if there was such a thing as ""militant secularism"" (to be compared with ""sleeping furiously"").

I'll quote the BHA Chief Exec. Andrew Copson here, as he's already said it very well today:

&gt; [""With government proposing to hand ever more schools and other public services to religious groups with only limited protections for the rights of staff and service users of the ""wrong"" or no religion, the need for an inclusive and secular approach to our public institutions has never been greater. At such a time it is surreal to hear secularism being condemned as intolerant - it is not secular schools that select pupils according to their parents' beliefs, it is not secular agencies that reserve employment opportunities for staff according to their beliefs, and it is not secular organisations which lobby to maintain privilege and have exemption from laws - like equality laws - that should affect everyone equally.""](http://www.humanism.org.uk/news/view/987)

In many ways he was right. There was a problem with language and integration. It still exists, but it's nowhere near as marked as it was. 

The problem for Honeyford was trying to start a public debate. He unleashed something that swallowed him and his argument whole. If he was to make any kind of productive argument about the issues he was trying to raise then it must be a nuanced one if it is not to be outright racist, and that's inevitably something that was lost here. 

I don't think he was outright racist, I think he was a serious educator with concerns for what he was able to offer some of his kids. He's ultimately talking about the way culture has an effect on education, particularly as it relates to the family. This is something that fails kids from all walks of life, whether they were born to 3rd-generation chavvy parents with little in the way of ambition or whether they were born to recent immigrants from a village in Kashmir who have come from a place where kids past a certain age are normally put to work. (I felt Honeyford-esque writing that last sentence. I'm trusting you to see the larger point here). It's hard enough in the former case, but in the latter there are extra barriers placed in the way by our desire to be culturally sensitive. 

The first unfortunate thing for his argument was that it was conducted in public, which meant that it was going to be hijacked by those prone to hyperventilation almost immediately.
