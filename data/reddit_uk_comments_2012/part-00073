true,ClampingNomads,null,null,"Just take the sports day example, not enough people question this sort of shit, which is a shame because it's really interesting!

We know that some people can run faster than others. If they couldn't, sports day would be fairly dull. We also know that while training and motivation and diet and effort and expensive trainers certainly *help*, there's a large and complicated genetic component to one's running ability. (For a simple demonstration of this, ask someone who was born with one leg...)

If that is true, by what stretch of the imagination is it even *possible* to make a running race *fair*? Unless we acknowledge that genetic variance is our common inheritance - pun intended - and allow our concept of *fairness* to be big enough to allow factors which are outside of an individual's control. Which, implicitly, is what we do, all the time. 

In fact if you want a competition to be absolutely fair on the basis of physiology, you'd have to have an Identical Twins Olympics. Which I'd certainly watch, it'd be absolutely fascinating. (I'd love to see a sports drink manufacturer who'd dare to sponsor one twin over another one drinking water.)

As for the British: what we value is the work ethic. We don't care if we win, so long as we've put up a damn good *struggle*. Which is actually pretty egalitarian, after all anyone can struggle painfully against the odds, in fact the disadvantaged paradoxically have the advantage of having greater odds to struggle against.

Hard work is of course identified with ""self-respect"" and all manner of noble ideas in this country, although (curse my poor memory) I can't recall ever hearing a credible explanation of that, at least by anyone who'd spent more than two minutes thinking about it. In less enlightened cultures self-respect is more likely to be associated with *achievement* of something, or perhaps even *working towards* attaining some noble principle or other. We prefer to identify with the *toil itself*, as if that has some value. Which it does, if the person toiling owns the product of their activity, which rules out most of us but that's another rant for another day.

This is worth emphasising. It is difficult to convey just how incredibly hard this university can be, academically but also in terms of the unusual environment you find yourself in. You would be sure to have a great experience BUT it might also be an extremely unpleasant one at times.

My advice is to spend a lot of time thinking about what you want to get out of your student experience. This is not a party town, although we have plenty of fun. But you need to figure out whether sacrificing nights out in London or Manchester is worth it for lectures on postmodernism or experimental psychology. And you should try and avoid anyone else influencing your answer, because they aren't the one who will have to make the application and do the course!

Incidentally, these are things I completely failed to think of when I applied and got in, a mistake in retrospect because I arrived pretty oblivious to the realities of the place. Again, Cambridge is REALLY FUCKING HARD WORK, almost certainly beyond anything you have gone through so far. But there are many upsides, the main one being the absolutely fascinating people you meet here and the research communities you have access to, but also the chance to measure your abilities against some of the most intelligent and hardest working people on the planet. 

Good luck, and do take the chance to at least look around the place during the open days. It gets rid of many of the tired stereotypes. ",0,1339712399,null,0,false,0,c50pepb,t3_v1t1q,t1_c50pepb,t1_c50jy4f,null,1429145005,6,false,cambridge_uni,t5_2s17x,6

true,Peritract,null,null,"The second part of your question has a very wide remit - we are an incredibly prolific nation, artistically speaking. It is difficult to distill that vast corpus down to a short list. It is even harder to define the quintessentially British - at different times, in different places, our ideals have been different ideals and our dreams different dreams.

However, I will say that Shakespeare should appear on any such list, because his shadow falls rather long over British culture. As for authors who express 'Britishness', I would suggest, amongst others (these are just four that spring to mind - I could list authors for years and still have more to go), Chesterton, Conan Doyle, Fleming, and Kipling - all either caught the public imagination or encapsulate an attitude. As Chesterton is likely to be least familiar, I submit a small sample of his work:

&gt;The Rolling English Road 

&gt;Before the Roman came to Rye or out to Severn strode, 
The rolling English drunkard made the rolling English road. 
A reeling road, a rolling road, that rambles round the shire, 
And after him the parson ran, the sexton and the squire; 
A merry road, a mazy road, and such as we did tread
The night we went to Birmingham by way of Beachy Head. 

&gt;I knew no harm of Bonaparte and plenty of the Squire, 
And for to fight the Frenchman I did not much desire; 
But I did bash their baggonets because they came arrayed 
To straighten out the crooked road an English drunkard made,
Where you and I went down the lane with ale-mugs in our hands, 
The night we went to Glastonbury by way of Goodwin Sands. 

&gt;His sins they were forgiven him; or why do flowers run 
Behind him; and the hedges all strengthening in the sun? 
The wild thing went from left to right and knew not which was which,
But the wild rose was above him when they found him in the ditch. 
God pardon us, nor harden us; we did not see so clear 
The night we went to Bannockburn by way of Brighton Pier. 

&gt;My friends, we will not go again or ape an ancient rage, 
Or stretch the folly of our youth to be the shame of age,
But walk with clearer eyes and ears this path that wandereth, 
And see undrugged in evening light the decent inn of death; 
For there is good news yet to hear and fine things to be seen, 
Before we go to Paradise by way of Kensal Green.  ",0,1339720463,null,0,false,0,c50r6o7,t3_v2ffy,t1_c50r6o7,t3_v2ffy,null,1429145970,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That is enough information for any parcel to be delivered. Extra information is always helpful.

The best way to organise the form is to have ask for:

I mean, the quote is said at a point in the episode where Amy is just heartbroken that Van Gogh *still* committed suicide, even after all they'd been through. She thought she had saved him. While the Doctor and Amy defeated Vincent's monster, they never really defeated what the monster was a metaphor for: his depression. The Doctor's telling her that just because they didn't, doesn't make what they did unimportant. Likewise, it doesn't mean that they didn't improve Van Gogh's life, and at least make his final years a bit happier than they would have been.

The line has neither cliche, bad joke, or insincerity. So, honestly, in what way is it cheesy? You may disagree with it, but that's how the Doctor views the world. If he believe anything else, why would his character go around helping people in fleeting moments of desperation? Why leave after the climactic sequence.

I would argue that the Doctor is being very serious about this, and we get a lot of insight into his psychology and outlook through this episode. So while you may not agree with it, I'm not sure on what grounds you can call it cheesy (other than it gets repeated far too often, like many other quotes).

&gt;People with with more than one child are bad parents? Have a quiet word with yourself son.

Nope.  I didn't say that somebody with more than one child is a bad parent.  

I said that any scheme won't work for a bad parent and inferred that if a parent that chooses to have more children than they can financially manage for themselves, then they don't get to use the excuse of childcare being too high.  That if you have more children than you can support (personal unforeseen financial horizons exempted -  but then the excuse of childcare costs doesn't imply rather the unforeseen financial event) you're dysfunctional and a bad parent.  That may sound harsh but if you willingly and knowingly have a child you aren't personally capable of supporting yourself, then, as PC incorrect as it might sound, you are a bad parent.   If you unwillingly or unknowingly have a child that you can't support, that you otherwise could have prevented, with exception on that it was imposed against your will, then you are dysfunctional at best.(and then you don't get to blame childcare costs on your dysfunction either).

If some hypothetical person that knows they can walk into a £50k job, are we seriously going to listen as an indictment of the state when they say they can't afford childcare, having known the cost of childcare, when they have their 5th child?  Of course not - it's preposterous. It's not a problem with childcare costs, it's that they've chosen to have x amount of children.

You wanna play the bold game?

**You just implied that people otherwise under the average wage aren't suitable to look after someone else's child!!!  Ipso facto by default, you've said that people that happen to earn less are bad parents.  Shame on you.**

See how that works?  Why would anybody judge somebody on their ability to love and care for a child on how much they can earn?  You beast.

&gt;Jesus. ""if your pregnancy resulted in more than 2 arms and legs""? That's the most fucked up way of describing a multiple birth in history. Well done you.

Hardly pertinent though is it?

You could have accepted my concession that if someone planning for only one child but got more than one, then that then places them in a different financial quandary, and an exception.  But no...excuses abound.

&gt;Your business model has gone from 10 kids, to the legally mandated 3 kids,

No it hasn't you mathematical and business incompetent.  You can have 2 kids other than your own and still use it as a template.  If you're financially viable with 2  people's other children at a younger age you're financially viable with more at a later age with experience and a spreadsheet.  I worked it out with 2 additional children.  3 in total.


&gt;where they pay you to raise your child in their house, and now the earnings magically jump from 10K to 25K.

Illiteracy again.  I said that if a woman can justify going to work and paying £30 a day childcare, which some clearly can because they're still earning thousands more than if they didn't and that's what the market on average is charging, at a £25k a year job then somebody charging £30 as the going rate to mind 2 children is immediately comparable.  Which it is when you account for what they have to pay in tax compared to the other person and for what they can claim back without paying the £7k annual childcare costs.

&gt;Fucking hell, please please please send me the video when you present this business model to your bank manager. Popcorn's on me.

It's already happening.  I don't know how you find this difficult.  The tax burden has already been raised.  The first $9k is tax free, they can get grants for qualifications which they can do at the weekends over a matter of months.  They get to claim tax reductions they could otherwise never claim.  The working parent has to pay 20% beyond their immediate pay allowance, NI, their fuel bills (and no way can managing 1 perpetual kid for 40hrs a week professionally increase your gas and electricity bill by 30% which is what you get back in tax), can't claim back on the numerous tax expenses at 20%, doesn't get to claim back on the annual investment allowance...

Add it up.  If it makes sense for a parent going back to work with a single child to a job that pays £25k but doesn't get any of the extra tax relief, has to pay full tax, and £7k on child minding, and that it is still profitable for them to do so, then someone staying at home, with all the deductibles and earning £15k are in the same comparable position at the end of the year except the child minder now has extra CV experience of a future business model.yea


It's not even a question of if presenting it to a bank manager.

**PEOPLE ARE ALREADY DOING IT.**

It's as simple as this: an adult charging £30 to look after two children other than their own for 40hrs a week is substantially better off than an adult staying at home saying they can't afford to go to work for around a £20k+ year job.  If you're a parent of more than one child who is your first born knowing the cost of childcare on conception (because it hasn't changed that much in which it took to go full term + whatever maternity leave left over) you don't get to use the cost of childcare as an excuse for not returning back to work.  You either choose to stay at home (which is fair enough) knowing that either you, your partner, or the state is paying for it.  In the case of the state you don't get to complain about the state's ills in this regard by claiming you can't afford to go back to work.  You can't afford to go back to work because you chose to keep having children and being a full time parent, not because of the cost of childcare.  **Christ, you could have someone that has a £50k a year job waiting for them complaining they can't go to work due to childcare costs because they have 5 kids, one after the other, at £36k a year to pay before tax in child minding.  It's ludicrous.**...and if they happen to have a partner that can more than afford the whole lot, they still don't get to use the excuse because they chose to not go to work to have several children and it's hardly to be used as an indictment of society's, or the market's, ills.

I'm likin' the bold.



...but tell me again that lower paid/skilled people are incapable of looking after children safely.  Do it.

I think their spending spree at the beginning of last season (Gervinho, Park, Arteta) plus the purchase of Podolski and Giroud will finish up most of the Fabregas and Silva money. 

United just bought Kagawa, and I actually think that is enough investment for them. There **are** rumours of them buying Lewandowski, though the Dortmund chairman might block it, so they might end up going for Huntelaar instead, but I think the major incentive for getting Lewandowski is the connection with Kagawa, and Huntelaar doesn't have that advantage. With Kagawa, Rooney can go back to playing as a striker, so having Rooney, Welbeck and Chicharito should be good enough for them. Ferguson isn't stupid, if he can't get Lewandowski, he would be better off getting a replacement for Carrick than having a 4th striker. 

Juventus has always been big admirers of Huntelaar, but his poor performance in the Serie A with AC Milan might deter them from making a move. If they do go in with a bid, I expect them to get him. Juve needs a consistent striker, and Huntelaar will thrive on the passes from Pirlo. 

Spurs are lacking a manager, I think we can forget about any transfers from them until they have that part wrapped up. 

Realistic or not, Liverpool needs to be looking at every player around. I have it on good authority that contrary to popular belief, the owners are preparing a cool 100 million pound transfer kitty for Rodgers for the next 2 seasons, but with very strict instructions on how the money should be spent, and requirements that redundant wage-earners should be sold before any spending.

To be honest, you probably won't need any form of public transport.

A bike makes things even easier.  Heck, even if you're working at Addenbrookes Hospital, the furthest point from the centre that I can think a student would want to go, it's still bikeable.  

As for trains, the only real 'passes' are a young person's railcard.  These are valid for a year, give you a third off train travel, and cost 24GBP.  However, it's probably not worth it for 6 weeks unless you decided to go up to Glasgow for a weekend or something.

true,sinjax,hampshire,Hampshire,"Classic words used throughout. Classic bullshit. Privacy as a ""fear of surveillance"", ""why are you trying to keep your actions secret if you haven't done anything wrong"" thing. 

The truth is that privacy is a complicated issue with many facets. [This excellent article in the chronicle](http://chronicle.com/article/Why-Privacy-Matters-Even-if/127461/) highlights other aspects of privacy including the bureaucratic ones like indifference, error, abuse, frustration and lack of transparency. 

Ignoring ""nothing to hide"" what if my government makes casual correlations between arbitrary activities and says that I'm a terrorist based on some half baked maths. What if when they do this I have no real way of telling that they have done this, until I try to book a flight, or leave the country.

What if I can't find out about the decisions made about me, and in fact I am actively prevented from doing so, either by policy, or by the incompetence/indifference of individuals who can easily avoid the public eye and continue ""doing their job""

Privacy is about more than ""well, if you aren't doing anything wrong..."" because it is exactly about someone else's definition of wrong. Further it is about the nitty gritty details which we so often sidestep. 

* Who controls the database? 
* Who gets access? 
* How will the data be analysed? - this is a **big** one. I analyse big data as my job. Who will be in charge of making sense of these massive datasets? Is their work going to be public? Do their algorithms suck? Or are going to be happy with a keyword search analysis with a linear model ham fisted in there being used to infer human behavior. Flag the terrorists. Well if you have nothing to hide you should be happy with an algorithm I wrote last night in the pub being used to decided whether you're a pedophile.  
* How long will the data be kept? 
* When it isn't kept any more what will happen to the data? Will it be sold? To whom, for what purpose? blah blah blah.

Bottom line: I have no trust whatsoever in my government to look after *anything*, let alone vast amounts of my personnel information. It is not about what I've done or what I plan to do, but rather about what officials can be trusted to understand, deal with or analyse with anything like a fair perspective.

As the article I linked above puts so brilliantly. Privacy concerns are not about the Orwellian problems, they are about the Kafkaesque problems.

true,Sanderf90,null,null,"I think when it comes to Doctor Who hating the new Doctor because you loved the old is in fact pretty much a wrong attitude. If the show didn't change it would have ended before the 70's and we should be happy for the changes it brings. Even when the changes aren't popular. Tennant to Smith came at a time when the stories were running dry for Russell T. Davies. Tennant didn't have to leave but considering new writer, a new Doctor could give Moffat the chance to really put to the show to his hand.

In character, the ""I don't want to go"" was because this Doctor had been avoiding his death ever since ""Your song is ending"" in Planet of the Ood. He had time to think about it and prepare for it and just when he thought he was out of the clear a new woman appears telling him the same thing. So the next time we see him he's having fun as himself because he doesn't want to die and yet where he ends up, on mars, isn't a fun place.

At this point he has to deal with his predestined death. And it is perfectly paralelled with the predestined death of Adelaide and her crew. So when he saves them and tells them he is the timelord victorious, he isn't doing it because he wants to save them. He's doing it because he can. And because this means he can save himself. The Ood at the end of the episode represents that he cannot avoid it.

When he finally ends up on the Oodplanet he did so when he had enough fun. He is a timetraveller he could have sat it out another hundred years or so but he deciced to go there knowing it would be his death. Because he knew he had no choice.

But he is still afraid. He has lived so long as this Doctor that he doesn't want to change anymore. When he survives both the Timelords and the Master he can't believe his luck. And Wilf's knocking shatters it into tiny pieces. This time he is given a simple choice. Wilf even tells him it is okay to do so. He can survive, he can still be 10 and live for another century or so.But he realizes that would be wrong. He doesn't want to go but he has to go. ""Sometimes I think a Timelord lives too long."". The entire episode is about Timelords fighting to survive. The Master in his dying body, Rassilon and the Timelocked Timelords on Gallifrey. All of them go so far to survive. The Doctor realizes that what makes him different is because he will do the right thing no matter the cost, even his life.

The second he sees Wilf he knows he'll do it. He hates himself. He hates what he has become: a man that cannot walk away. But because he is the Doctor and not just another timelord. Because even if the laws of time obey him, he chooses to obey them, he steps into the booth gladly.

After that he knows it is over. He is given ""his reward"". He goes back and visits all those important to him. And his final words: I don't want to go. 
Sum up his final fight so well. He doesn't want to go. He has to go.

As for the Smith v Tennant debate:

David Tennant is the best actor. Matt Smith is the best Doctor. 
In interviews with David Tennant I see a splendid man with a scottish accent but he isn't the Doctor. 

When I see Matt Smith being interviewed I see an actor with the attitude of what his Doctor is. I think that is why we see more interaction with young children when it comes to Smith.

Easy.  It's only current working policy that I'm reciting that many people are already putting into practice.

I care to note you're not actually bringing any facts or policies to the argument; only uninformed argument like I can't do it with 2 children (people do), and you'd have to pay business rates (you don't), or that tuition/registration costs (grant subsidised and very small).

&gt;Parents who can't afford Childcare are not sponging off the state. 

Some are.  Some aren't.

&gt;In general one parent remains in work while the other stays home with the kids.

And if they choose and plan that then they're hardly invoking the excuse 'I can't go to work because childcare is too expensive'.

&gt;What your rant about them being bad parents because of this comes from I don't know.

Didn't I just say no to that.

&gt;You really have no understanding of the subject at all, and your last couple of posts were more than a little incoherent and scary.

Apparently I brought some facts and figures to the table that leaves you left with calling names and nothing else.

&gt;You have some growing up to do son.

See, you're overusing the line of 'son' to try and strike a reaction because I said earlier that it is an insult for me to be considered your son and because your argument falters. For a son you've already accepted that I have more business acumen and knowhow.

Let's keep to the economic facts:  a parent that can't quite afford to go to work to pay £30 in childcare costs can either approach a similar parent without the same employment potential, or for themselves to accept it unto themselves, and allow both to earn more, plus another, and for the state to be better off too.  They don't have to be above average earners or skilled for most people to think they're not beneath looking after a child.    

Where's the problem with that?

It's like the guys you see from time to time where they're joking constantly about ""Girls should be in the kitchen, hur dur"" then the next thing is ""Why cant I get a girlfriend?"" Why the fuck do you think, genius?!

You make a good point about people's money management. I definitely see the same thing here in the UK... I've been living off about £4,500 this year (before rent and bills) to pay for my education and don't think that I live too badly, although I have no money for luxuries. 

The point I'm trying to make though is more to do with safety nets (I'd argue that peace of mind is more valuable than differences in material wealth). From what I understand the poorest get basic medical insurance in most states, but if you fall ill without insurance it can be devastating. The cost of even basic medical care is unaffordable for those barely making ends meet. Similarly, the fact that in many states employers can get rid of staff with no notice without needing to give a reason is horrific (I've heard many on Reddit saying that taking your full holiday allocation is taboo for fear of losing their job, which is disgusting). Not to mention that higher education is prohibitively expensive for many, without a system like in the UK where the loan is paid back only when you earn over a certain figure.

The simply problem in the USA is that if you're near the bottom and something bad happens that might not even be your fault (losing your job, getting ill, whatever) you could very easily find yourself screwed.

Legally, there's not much difference these days, but women still face discrimination in practical terms; they are less likely to be accepted for a job in IT, for example.  I work in IT and my female colleagues all have horror stories.

I myself have noticed the trend when interviewing; a female candidate is more likely to underrate her abilities, not negotiate so hard on salary, but (at my job) is more likely to be hired.  Not for the salary, but when we get women applying for roles, they are just more likely to underrate themselves and therefore be better at interview for the role they are applying for: they tend to score higher in the standard tests.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;It's hard to deal with some one who has selective blindness

Indeed, but I'm hoping that if I keep highlighting when you do this, you'll address the gaps with something other than lame insults.

&gt;little command of rational discourse

By that I guess that (going by your replies) you mean your opinion is fact unless others can provide enough evidence to prove you wrong to your satisfaction. Not how it works. It has already been shown that your blanket statements are incorrect, so now it's your turn to show that this is more than just your opinion. So, what have you done? Insults instead of evidence. Again. Go on, dance some more, I'm sure attrition is just as good as facts. In your mind, at least.

&gt;who thinks if you keep 'dancing' long enough no matter what incoherent babble is produced you 'win' the argument

Otherwise known as 'waiting for you to produce evidence that directly contradicts mine'. Shall we compare dancing lists? Oh look, you win. By a mile. One of us gave up when asked for proof, and that's who's been dancing. And is dancing still, it would seem.

&gt;and uses arguments on the level of 'little girls find royalty seductive therefore tourism'.

Odd that you fail to address this point until this stage, and then think it's actually adding to your argument instead of highlighting *another* point you failed to address - but feel free to do it now by providing your own evidence showing that tourists don't find the royals appealing. Throw all the insults you like, it's not going to make any difference. Your opinion has been revealed to be just that, and nothing more.

&gt;It makes sense though if you are speaking from experience.

Logic, really. Or are you also ignorant of the popularity of Disney princesses with little girls? Feel free to illustrate how none of that group would be interested in a *real* princess, or Queen (etc.) - but you're only demonstrating your incapacity to comprehend anything outside of your opinions.

&gt;I imagine your daughter could well have a far more coherent view of the world than yourself

Sure, because she's *completely different* to all the other little girls, right? Exaggerate all you like - it's just another line of text that features *no links*.

&gt;so I would too defer all important family decisions like holiday destinations, investment opportunities and the like.

You're so desperate to attack, your comprehension has gone out of the window. Are you now suggesting that this appeal is limited to little girls, and not grown-up ones?

&gt;Let's hope the apple fell a good distance from the tree.

Yeah, this isn't a common thing amongst *most* girls in any way at all - you only have the opinions of a few million *other* little girls (and a large number of grown-up ones) to dismiss to have any kind of point. You *really* don't consider how dumb these statements make you look, and once again you demonstrate your incapacity to comprehend anything outside your own ideas.

&gt;Your smugness is really preventing insight into your ignorance

Really? Keep dancing, insulting, anything than provide evidence and you'll get to see how sarcastic I can be and not much more - were you expecting another outcome with your amazingly inaccurate insight? Coming from someone that doesn't even realise that the royals are popular with tourists, and refuses to acknowledge facts that go against their, er, ignorance, that accusation will cause no end of lost sleep. Please, define ignorance some more - you've already demonstrated what happens when you rely on that and nothing else.

&gt;but that isn't surprising because it is an all too common British desease

Ah, so now we're down to xenophobia - do let all the commonwealth countries (that also like the royals) know this as well. Someone expecting you to provide facts to back up your assumptions really is inconvenient for you, isn't it? Look how far you're prepared to go with no facts while still under the assumption that a casual reader would agree with you automatically (just like you do with tourists). But hey, throw some more insults - it's really making up for your *demonstrated* ignorance. 

&gt;the combination of arrogance and ignorance,

Yes, it is quite arrogant to assert the conversation is over and then carry on...oh sorry, you've already done that. Or that your pre-determined opinion couldn't possibly be incorrect. Only one of us has laid out our opinions based on what we 'believe' instead of *know* - and it wasn't me.

&gt;one precludes knowledge of the other.

And there we have it. You have failed to provide any evidence to support your opinion, fail to pick apart the evidence that does the opposite, used the same website yourself after proclaiming it 'trash' (such *consistency*!), then go on and on about ignorance under the apparent assumption that your *entire output* in this thread hasn't been backed up by a single piece of, er, knowledge (and that nobody would notice this).

You wont need to use buses inside the city. You can walk from one side of Cambridge to the other in an hour. You can walk from one side of the centre to the other in 10 minutes.

&gt; Is the megarider a pass for free travel or a pass that discounts my travel?

It is a ticket which allows unlimited travel for a fixed period at no extra cost.

&gt; Also, is the megarider only good for the local area?

['good'... ah... Americanisms :)] It depends what you mean by 'local'. It only covers the immediate Cambridge area. The megarider plus covers the entire of Cambridgeshire but is more expensive. I doubt there is enough to see in Cambridgeshire to justify the additional expense when compared to just buying a ticket on the bus for any journeys outside of Cambridge.

Also, and I realise this might be patronising but I'm telling you this from experience of American visitors, London is not the local area for Cambridge. In the UK, the local area stops at a radius of around five miles, not the 100 miles that the US seems to use :).

Things such as boys jobs Fireman, policeman, train driver and girls jobs teacher, nurse etc. I think through the toys we give our children, the media we provide them with (cartoons, magazines etc) and the current state of perceived gender roles. We limit the acceptability or desire to follow particular career routes. I would say for example I would say men/boys would be discouraged from entering nursing and women/girls from saying becoming a police men. I think both genders are guilty I have seen men sneer at the idea of being a nurse and women say horrible things about friend of mine who was a stay at home dad (while his wife went out to work). The other problem is I am not sure how to fix this issue. More information in school would be a good start and maybe ensuring on carer day that for each role possible both a man and a women come to talk to the children. I know gender should not matter but when your young I think you look at others like you and what they do and your gender is a big part of that.

It's to stop people coming in and out of the venue, which apparently was becoming a big problem. 

Example, 5 People would go in with 5 tickets, one friend would go out with the 5 (now used/registered) with the scanners and go and get 4 other friends. A lot of tickets won't have the names on them just 1xAdult and a those ticket scanners are notoriously unreliable. 

'So just stop those guys!' I'd agree but 90% of the people working at these concerts and events don't have something called an S.I.A. license. What this means is they have no legal grounds to physically touch you. So if there are X-thousand people walking in and out the venue, if you catch someone trying the scam their way in and they just say 'Fuck you' and walk off or insist you're in the right, that worker has to get SIA staff to bring you to the ticket office or chase you down.

But really, it's a decision that's weighed up two factors: firstly the convenience for security (which is pretty big) against the number of people who actually want to keep their ticket (which I always found surprisingly low).

Personally I hated telling someone that they can't keep their ticket, especially because I like going to gigs myself. If you ask someone collecting the tickets to hold on to yours for when you egress, if they're not working flat out and you're polite, 9/10 they'll stuff it in their pocket and keep it for you.

It is not simply a case of 36 years v. 2000 years, in this respect, numbers actually mean very little. Firstly, Amy is left behind through no choice or fault of her own. In comparison, Rory chose to wait as a penance for killing Amy, he wanted to protect her, yes, but when you consider the Pandorica is meant to hold the Doctor, it’s probably pretty secure.

Amy is left in isolation for those 36 years with no human or alien contact, with daily battles to stay alive. She changed enormously during those years, how many times must she have had depressive moments in which she considers giving up and letting the handbots put her to sleep? But no, every day she fought to live – 13140 days of fighting.

In comparison, yes, Rory fought to protect the Pandorica. But it was not every day, he was not under constant threat for his life. He was able to protect the Pandorica simply by being there as a presence and even just persuading people to leave it alone. Furthermore, during his time he was able to socialise with other people, he travelled the world, he fought alongside historical figures, he had a *life* that did not revolve around just staying alive.

Rory knew what would happen at the end of his waiting – he’d already seen the Doctor in his fez, he knew Amy survived, heck, in a way he even knew he would survive. Amy however didn’t, she was stuck waiting for the Doctor who has already continually abandoned her (and abandonment as a child is a difficult thing to forget). She didn’t know what would happen and whether she would ever see Rory again. When Young Amy sees Future Amy, you can see the memories start to form, Time is rarely circular in the Whoniverse, and we cannot assume that Future Amy actually previously experienced that conversation.

Ageing: Amy aged. She grew old without the husband she loves and is suddenly confronted him in his young glory. The embarrassment, shame and anger she must be feeling towards the Doctor depriving them of the best years of her life. And she is angry at the Doctor – not Rory – because he hides away in his TARDIS and doesn’t face what has happened.

Rory however didn’t age. Yes, there was a threat of death and not healing, but the passage of time was never an issue. He knew he would be physically young when Amy awoke, and in a sense it didn’t matter because his goal was the future, it was to waste time.

Furthermore, the fact that these posts suggest that Rory would say such a thing to Amy is abhorrently out of character for him. He would *never* revel in Amy’s misery, or try to compete in a “who suffered the most” competition. If you don’t like Amy, fine, whatever, but using this episode to accuse her of being a “bitch” is, in my opinion, woefully ignorant of both their experiences.",0,1339760086,null,0,false,0,c50xlmd,t3_v2twl,t1_c50xlmd,t3_v2twl,null,1429148993,17,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,17

I was meaning more in *how* you drive and people's attitudes, not specifically having a car bought for you makes you a dickhead, hell my mum decided to cover my insurance for my 21st, so I can't exactly talk about that.

I never said every young person can afford it, that's my point.

If you *can't* afford it, then simply put, you shouldn't have one. 

There's far too many people who see car's as an entitlement and don't realise that they should have to work for it, and because they see it as something that should be given to them, a lot then have egocentric attitudes when driving - which causes higher premiums for everyone in that age group because of reckless driving.

If a women earns more than her husband (not exactly uncommon in this day and age) and cheated on him for example, he should not have to pay child support. 

Property is a different matter entirely, but again, economic circumstances should be taken in to account, it makes no sense to force someone on minimum wage out of their home if the other person could afford to buy a property out right. 

Custody, if it can't be settled out of court, should be dependant on the quality of life the child would recieve (if the child isn't old enough to make the decision themselves), so if the mother lives in a council estate in the middle of bradford, and the father lives in a £300k property in the richer area's of leeds, then the father should get custody.

""**Statement on school meals from Argyll and Bute Council**

**Published Date:**  15 Jun 2012 - 10:53

Argyll and Bute Council wholly refutes the unwarranted attacks on its schools catering service which culminated in national press headlines which have led catering staff to fear for their jobs. The Council has directly avoided any criticism of anyone involved in the ‘never seconds’ blog for obvious reasons despite a strongly held view that the information presented in it misrepresented the options and choices available to pupils however this escalation means we had to act to protect staff from the distress and harm it was causing. In particular, the photographic images uploaded appear to only represent a fraction of the choices available to pupils, so a decision has been made by the council to stop photos being taken in the school canteen.

There have been discussions between senior council staff and Martha’s father however, despite an acknowledgement that the media coverage has produced these unwarranted attacks, he intimated that he would continue with the blog.

The council has had no complaints for the last two years about the quality of school meals other than one from the Payne family received on 6 June and there have been no changes to the service on offer since the introduction of the blog.

Pupils have a daily choice of two meals from a menu which is designed with pupils, parents and teachers. Our summer menu is about to be launched and includes main course choices like meat or vegetarian lasagne served with carrots and garlic bread or chicken pie with puff pastry, mashed potato and mixed vegetables.

Pupils can choose from at least two meals every day. They pay £2 for two courses and this could be a starter and a main or a main and a desert. Each meal comes with milk or water. Pupils can have as much salad and bread as they want. Salad, vegetables, fruit, yoghurt and cheese options are available every day. These are standing options and are not a result of any changes in response to the blog site.

As part of the curriculum for excellence, pupils in all our schools are regularly taught about healthy eating and at lunch breaks staff encourage pupils to make good choices from what is on offer. We use a system called ‘Nutmeg’ to make sure everything is nutritionally balanced. Our staff also get nutrition awareness training so they know how to provide a good healthy meal. There is portion sized guidance which we adhere to and it is matched to the age of the child so they get the right amount of food. Second portions would mean too many calories for pupils.

In Lochgilphead Primary School we are piloting a new pre-ordering scheme which is designed to encourage class discussion around meal choices and also improves the accuracy of meal choices. The pupils use a touch screen to select their lunch option and the data is downloaded in the kitchen so they know how many portions of each meal are required. As they place their order, the pupils are given a coloured band which relates to their meal choice that day. They wear it during the morning, and at lunchtime they hand it to the catering assistant, who will give them the corresponding meal.

The council’s focus is now on supporting the school in the education of young people in Argyll and Bute.""",0,1339764513,null,0,false,0,c50y509,t3_v39mm,t1_c50y509,t3_v39mm,null,1429149247,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

&gt; Statement from Cllr Roddy McCuish, Leader of Argyll and Bute Council

&gt; ""There is no place for censorship in this Council and never will be whilst I am leader.   I  have advised senior officers that this Administration intends to clarify the Council's policy position in regard to taking photos in schools. I have therefore requested senior officials to consider immediately withdrawing the ban on pictures from the school dining hall until a report can be considered by Elected Members. This will allow the continuation of the ""Neverseconds"" blog written by an enterprising and imaginative pupil, Martha Payne which has also raised lots of money for charity. 

&gt; But we all must also accept that there is absolutely no place for the type of inaccurate and abusive attack on our catering and dining hall staff, such as we saw in one newspaper yesterday which considerably inflamed the situation.  That, of course, was not the fault of the blog, but of the paper.

&gt; We need to find a united way forward so I am going to bring together our catering staff, the pupils, councillors and council officials - to ensure that the council continues to provide  healthy, nutrious and attractive school meals.  That ""School Meals Summit"" will take place later this summer.

&gt; I will also meet Martha and her father as soon as I can, along with our lead councillor on Education, Michael Breslin to seek her continued engagement, along with lots of other pupils, in helping the council to get this issue right.   By so doing Martha Payne and her friends  will have had a strong and lasting influence not just on school meals, but on the whole of Argyll &amp; Bute.""

i think his problem in the Chelsea locker room was dealing with the egos......Terry is widely regarded as a cunt, Cole is an ass as well, Lampard isn't exactly a gem either. Torres is a prima dona and despite his mostly saintly actions off the field Drogba is also a prima dona and all of them excluding Torres are around the same age as AVB and have had complete run of the locker room for several seasons....makes it tough to control a team when the players more or less know that just have to wait out the manager who is likely to get fired.

Compare that to the Spurs locker room, The RAF Captain, Dawson, Benny, Friedel, Younes, Huddlestone, Gallas are all fairly humble guys who do what is asked of them.  Hell, VDV, Defoe and Lennon are the closest thing we have to prima donas and all of them have at times have dealt with coming off the bench and not being happy with substitution practices yet in the end all have shown they are willing to toe the line and do as asked when they are needed.  Despite what his agent seems to be trying to do Bale is one of the most low key ""superstar"" players i have ever seen. Even Modders who wanted out (and still may want to) didn't throw a tantrum when he wasn't moved.

Spurs have different personalities than the Chelsea team and look a better fit for AVB to be accepted. On top of that, if I were Levy i would sign Ledley up as part of the coachinng staff to ensure that AVB's message and tactics are being related to the players.

I was very happy with my most recent hire, and whoever has been turning her down for jobs was just plain stupid.  

We hire only the top 10-20% in terms of ability; to get in, you have to pass some hardcore tests and then harder one-on-one grillings.  The women we hire tend to come from lower-paid jobs with fewer opportunities.  Their previous employers are literally throwing away their resources.

5 years is a long time in a job these days, so to not hire a talented woman because she *might* have a baby is a policy which harms that company.

More than you do, it would appear.

&gt;Notice where Windows doesn't have control of the hardware Windows doesn't often get installed:

What do you mean by 'control'?

&gt;servers

You're suggesting there's another OS that gets installed on servers more often? That the likes of linux servers account outnumber the corp-side Windows ones? And you're lumping servers in with devices, now - you appear to be confusing yourself.

&gt;I find it odd though how out of no where really in a conversation about tourism you twice chose to interleave a dig at linux

It's not a dig. It's fact. Whether you take it as a dig usually depends on how much of a linux fan you are.

&gt;into you incoherent babble about postcards.

You mean surveys of 25,000? Oh, sorry, carry on with your reductionism. It's worked so well each time you've done it before.

Or maybe I just expect to see evidence in return.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Child support is for the benefit of the children and ensuring their hardship from the divorce is minimised. The reason for the split shouldn't affect this. 

Alimony is a separate issue. Even if the poorer spouse cheated, if the sacrifices they made for their marriage limited their future earning potential, alimony might be quite justifiable. I think it should be a case by case basis, of course. I don't think that cheating is this capital crime that it's made out to be. If the relationship was breaking down - usually the fault of both people - but they had many good years before, well that's very different to someone cheating after six months. 

In terms of quality of life for kids, there is more to it than living in a posh house in a rich area. If the wealthier parent is working all of the time it's going to take away from any advantage gained. Perhaps it would be better for the child to spend most time with their other parent, and for the wealthier parent to provide awesome holidays/weekends and some cash to keep them out of poverty. You shouldn't penalise people or their children for having or not having money.

It's also worth considering that the reason the mother is poor and the father rich *might* be because she gave up or compromised in her career to be wife/mommy and support the husband in his. Turning around and penalising her for that would be unjust. A lot of people who end up very wealthy do so with a lot of support from people at home. Even if the home making spouse cheated, it doesn't necessarily undo all the good they did. They have arguably worked toward that high wage, just less directly. 

Oh and sure you'll say 'well it was her choice' except it's not so cut and dry. Where one person gives up or otherwise compromises a career, it's generally done to benefit the whole family and the career of their spouse. In many cases there is no real choice because their earnings aren't enough to make it worth the childcare, social pressures come in and/or the other person can't or won't be so flexible. Being 'primary carer' for children means you are the one taking time off work if one is sick or whatever, working less hours, being less flexible. It can be limiting for a career.

Considering the hype Huntelaar is experiencing now, he will be expecting nothing less than an assured first-team place. This is extra pertinent to him due to the ups-and-downs he went through in Milan and Madrid. 

While Carroll still has room for improvement, he isn't young anymore. Whatever improvement he can make won't be on the training pitch, it will be gained from regular football. With Huntelaar coming in, what do you expect the situation to be? If one gets regular precedence over the other, then the one out in the cold will want to leave for first team football.

The case about Andy Carroll is that he has a giant elephant on his shoulder. The price tag of 35 million is a huge one. I seriously doubt the owners are enthusiastic about having to sell him for 12 million in 3 years time without him giving us any significant ROI. This is a guy that we NEED to succeed. 

We need a backup for the striker position, but it doesn't have to be someone as highly rated as Huntelaar. Although I don't support the rumour, Luuk de Jong would be a better option than Huntelaar, because not only will he be joining us from a smaller club, he is also not the top scorer in the Bundesliga.

Russia used women in many different battles during WWII and saw great things with the all female unites. The problem was not about the female unites though. The problem was with the male unites around the female unites had the lowest morale out of all the unites. Seeing women injured or killed made many unites lose complete control.After the war women were banned from being in combat with males. female soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces have been officially prohibited from serving in close combat military operations since 1948 (in 2001, subsequent to publication, women began serving in IDF combat units on an experimental basis). The reason for removing female soldiers from the front lines is no reflection on the performance of female soldiers, but that of the male infantrymen after witnessing a woman wounded. The IDF saw a complete loss of control over soldiers who apparently experienced an uncontrollable, protective, instinctual aggression.

To get current sooner rather than later, start with Series (Season) 5, Episode 1 ""The Eleventh Hour."" This introduces the Eleventh Doctor, a new companion, and is almost like a new start for the show. Watch through to present, then you'll be ready for the new episodes of Series 7 beginning later this year.

The second method is to start with the 2005 reboot, in Series 1, Episode 1, ""Rose."" this was where the show was intended to reintroduce the Doctor and the show to a new generation of viewers, then watch through to present. Even if you take the previous option of starting in Series 5, I'd advise you do this after catching up to the present.

After you are current on New Who, then you might consider watching some Classic Who, 1963-1989. The episodes from the 1970's &amp;amp; 1980's are more approachable for modern viewers. Also don't forget the 1996 Doctor Who movie, with the Eighth Doctor.

They say they have cracked https, have they also cracked tor/ssh/etc? Proper criminals will be able to hide or atleast make it so that it would require a server farm to decrypt a single session. The FBI have admitted it can't track people on the onion net unless they are stupid enough to post personal info. They are talking about a network rife with black markets where you can buy drugs, passports and guns etc and is also filled with child porn.

I cannot accept that this will actually catch anyone except a few idiots who fail to properly encrypt their communications when doing some illegal things and the costs and privacy invasions outweigh the benefits by far.

true,e_d_a_m,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottm.,"&gt; Is obeying a speed limit really that much of a hardship?

You are hugely oversimplifying the situation.

I don't know about you, but I don't particularly want to live in a world where I constantly have to work to petty limitations that exist because some git somewhere has decided that I am not able to drive responsibly; where I constantly have to be concerned, whilst driving, about being fined or prevented from driving for exceeding one the many, *many* limits when I should be concentrating on the road.

And the fact that a conflict of interests exists and that *money is being earned* by increasing the likelihood of these trivial misdemeanours occuring just makes the situation ten times as bad. There are countless cases where such limits don't make sense, or are obviously designed to catch out the unwitting driver: new, short 30 sections--and an accompanying camera--being put in the middle of long, open 40 roads; 50 limits on well-lit, 3-lane, straight sections of dual carriageway that even operate at night when there are virtually no cars on the road; temporary excessive limits (e.g., 60 to 30) where roadworks are taking place; the list goes on.

What this comes down to is that I have no particular problem with speed limits whatsoever. What I have a problem with is the way that they are being overused/abused and enforced. It used to be that you would get pulled over for speeding and would have the opportunity to speak to a human being about it. Nowadays, it is an automated system that creates a revenue for the government. It made £114.6m in 2005/6 fiscal year.

&gt; All the more reason not to speed.

picture this a small business maximises its potential profits in a small rental space, refuses to move on from said premises due to high rental prices.

This may happen but in a growth market, and you oly have to look at the new TV deal to see that football EPL in particular is still growing it makes good business sense to try to maximise that growth potential, take the hit  in the short term and have your business develop in the long term.

Say for instance that football as a whole had a severe downturn in a couple of years, Arsenal Man U etc can have flexibility in their business model to reduce ticket prices to keep attendances high and fall back on corporate revenue.

Liverpool will have to maximise their foreign growth potential to grow, all the other top sides can grow domestically aswell as abroad.

Meaning they are perfectly possible of deciding that you defaulted on the scheme, and refusing to let you use it in future. 

If you think this is stupid pity my mother. She bought a licence and put down her address exactly as normally does - the house number followed by the letter A indicating the flat ""##a"". However TV licensing have the address as ""Flat A ##"". Her version matches the official Royal Mail address, theirs doesn't. You'd think anyone would be able to work out the 2 are the same thing, not TV licensing. They sent threatening letters for months and eventually an inspector visited when she was at home. Standing at the door and looking at the 2 doors for the building they still wouldn't accept it until she showed them the physical license. 

Incidentally I have never seen anyone who was fined who didn't open the door to the inspectors. They talk a lot about their detector vans etc. but in reality the prosecutions and fines always seem to be based on statements taken at the door. (Which it would appear are sometimes made up if the person doesn't speak English). 

Does anyone know of anyone who was fined without that ? Also whether you can now legally have a TV if you don't have a digital decoder instead of having to have them modified ?

I have never had a license. It is a last step to being an adult I have refused to take, but for the last 5 years or so I haven't had a TV. I'm happy with the internet.

There are also periphery clubs like Wimbledon Brentford Watford etc. So really when you look at the population of London say 10million, the population increases in the summer due to tourism which I wont count because they arnt native and theres no football to see there is not such a huge difference. Liverpools population is roughly 500, 000 more if you count the greater met area like we are doing with london and divide it by two for everton. You actually get a suprisingly even figure in terms of numbers of people.

Football support in Liverpool is also fanatical massive amounts of Londoners are exclusively into rugby and take no interest in football.

So yeah I concede you can charge more for sporting event tickets in London, but even this is a bit of a grey area as the demand for liverpool tickets is usually high and we could foreseeably equal the prices at somewhere like white hart lane.

Henry vastly overstates the potential earning power of london, having sat in a half empty stadium across from putney bridge watching fulhams adventures in europe I can attest to this.

Your point about executive boxes is perhaps valid but if you compare something like the turnout for boxes at a one off sporting event such as the grand national just 20mins from anfield I thnk i could make a business case for a healthy allocation of executive boxes at Anfield.

When I did own a television I avoided them by cunningly not opening the door. 

I have a real problem with TV licensing. Firstly it really annoys me that they assume you are breaking the law until they find out otherwise. I get regular notices insisting I fill in forms etc. to say I don't have a television - but as someone without a television I don't owe them anything. Then it ends up being a system that criminalises the poor. They actually enforce based on density of homes without TV licensing, meaning they disproportionally enforce against high density low income housing. They also prosecute without considering whether it is in the public interest, unlike criminal offences dealt with by the police and CPS (the other major offender is Transport for London, who give people criminal records for ridiculously things).

true,TheEpicMuffinMan,troughton,Troughton,"To me, it's like the combination of Star Trek and The Big Bang Theory. A spacey show full of wisdom, and inspirational moments; while having the same aspect of a cheeky, comedic, and nerdy show. 

The Doctor is always an interesting character, showing that fear must be replaced with wonder. He acts like an energetic child, while still having the mind of the universe. Sometimes he shows such admiration for his human companions, while sometimes he strokes his TARDIS in total love.

Every minor character sees him in his wise state, but the major ones sees him only in his perky state. I love his character, and the show. 

I remember watching the original shows as a child, but it wasn't a very vivid memory, only a couple of clips. When a friend of mine, a ""Whovian"", reminded me of it; I started watching the show again, starting from 2005's Series 1 ""Rose"". I fell in love with it again. The reappearances of the Daleks, and the Cybermen gave me the happy memories of my childhood again. 

I soon started my marathon, buying Doctor Who antiques, trying various cosplays, and showing friends my obsession. Me and my friends now have amazing inside jokes from Doctor Who too. Those occasional ""Hey, is that from Doctor Who?"" moments from other strangers are always fun too. ;D

If you're going to start watching Doctor Who, I really recommend it. 

But for now, Allons-y! 

BTW: The Doctor you saw was the Ninth (Christopher Eccleston), accompanied by Rose (Billie Piper).

true,charonthemoon,mccoy,McCoy,"What's so great about Doctor Who? It's for everyone. Doctor Who is a sci-fi adventure series, but it also has comedy, tragedy, drama, romance, action, horror, fantasy, and mystery. It's loved by nostalgic adults, geeky teens, and children. Throughout it's many, many seasons, it has maintained the same *feel*, yet it is always changing. Individual episodes take place in all different times and places, with different enemies. The Doctor's companions change every few seasons - and so does The Doctor himself. If you don't like something about the show, it will change soon enough. And once you get into the show, you can learn about its utterly fascinating history.

Just like the Doctor himself, the show has so many faces, but all at once. Watch it for the characters, or for the time-travel. Watch it for the historical figures, or the alien invasions. Watch it because it is fun, exciting, and a bit silly, or because it is deep, dark, and emotional. Doctor Who is a show that everyone can love, all in different ways. 

If you've only watched one or two episodes, you've only seen a bit of what it has to offer, and you were probably just trying to keep track of all of the things you were learning about the show. Keep watching. Personally, I think that episode was a bit slower compared to the later ones, so don't give up yet!

true,_sik,null,null,"This is true. St. John's also has a legendary May Ball, for which it's hard to get tickets as a non-member of the college. Other colleges opt for less grand affairs or only organise the Ball biannually. I'd think that socially the atmosphere is pretty similar everywhere (all-female/all-postgrad colleges might be an exception), although most colleges maintain that theirs is the best in this regard. Some colleges have stereotypes associated with them and this might create a slight amount of self-selection, but it's nothing too noticeable. Some **stereotypes** I've heard: King's = left-wing/activist, Peterhouse = Conservative, Jesus = Welsh. Colleges also have famous alumni, which might attract some fans of the respective famous person if they're marginally undecided between a few colleges.


The university also keeps saying that it's equally hard to get admitted to all colleges, but I think this is only partially true: Colleges that are less popular for one reason or another get fewer direct applicants or sometimes just many low-quality applicants. As a result of this they take more applicants that other colleges barely rejected (these are called *pooled applicants*). Popular colleges effectively get the first pick of students while less popular colleges fight over the remainder. If all the best applicants choose popular colleges, there should be a clear difference in average admission standards. A difference in minimum admission standards arises if the verbal/written parts of the application are weighted differently for a direct vs pooled applicant. E.g. someone with amazing interview skills might be better off applying to a college they think they'll get in directly than aiming too high and then getting into the pool. And yes, some pooled applicants are interviewed again, but this still doesn't mean that admission standards are uniform: now a mysterious subset of pooled applicants get offered a second chance, so someone who might be nervous the first time around would be better of hoping to get pooled and that they fit the unknown re-interview criteria... 


There is also a middle-ground of self-sufficient colleges, that don't have to rely on the pool too much, but that also don't pool too many students themselves. This adds some further shades of grey to the analysis above. Note however that the popular/middle-ground/un-popular status of a college doesn't directly translate into academic performance, as colleges aren't perfect in predicting who'd make a good student. A promising applicant might just choose to focus more on extracurriculars, internships etc and slightly neglect their studies as a result. E.g. John's can afford to be more selective with their applicants, but they didn't place very well in the Tompkins table (= ranking of colleges based on tripos results) last year.

Lastly, some colleges also admit a relatively large number of students in certain subjects: Caius = Medicine, Churchill = Engineering/Sciences, Downing = Law, Trinity = Mathematics and this might also influence one's college choice. I'm not sure if any college is particularly renowned for Land Economy/PPS, but some colleges only choose 0-1 students in those subjects per year so that's something to consider if you'd like to have someone else doing the subject at your college.",0,1339782161,null,0,false,0,c5121m5,t3_v1t1q,t1_c5121m5,t1_c50pvlm,null,1429151155,1,false,cambridge_uni,t5_2s17x,1

Which they've been doing for years, nay decades. ECHELON is very real. 

&gt; So the direct initial cost of it would be the standard administrative costs of passing new laws. 

No. The proposal is for ISPs to collect and store data. As it stands now they have watch lists that they collate data from. Now they want the whole lot available for retroactive searching. 


&gt; It's hard to estimate how much they would save the taxpayer by putting people who would otherwise cause very expensive criminal damage behind bars. 

Nonsense. Every media pirates know how to to get around these measures, it's utterly trivial. It will only catch the clueless and the false positives, neither of whom are doing any notable damage to anything. 

&gt; is also the point that though they may be given the power to do it, the security services do not have an appropriate budget to do it on a any scale except very selective. 

Again wrong. Recently the US twitter/facebook watch list [was forced to be revealed](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2150281/REVEALED-Hundreds-words-avoid-using-online-dont-want-government-spying-you.html), as was [the web one](http://boingboing.net/2012/01/11/homeland-security-internet-wat.html). They are far from selective. Trigger enough keywords and you'll be flagged for some form of investigation. 

&gt; This won't be like Orwellian 1984. 

No, it will be far worse. At least Winston could step out of the telescreens field of view. He didn't conduct any of his communication electronically. 

I'd say it would be more like ""Brazil"". People will get their lives ruined by baseless investigations. See [Operation Ore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_ore) for example, a bunch of people were accused of child abuse because seemingly cast-iron data was completely misinterpreted.

true,geekchic,null,null,"&gt; As quietly as possible, BBC world news editor Jon Williams has admitted that the coverage of last month’s Houla massacre in Syria by the world’s media and his own employers was a compendium of lies.

By ""as quietly as possible"", he means on the BBC website itself in the highly read Editors blog which garnered 39 comments on that one posting alone?

http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2012/06/reporting_conflict_in_syria.html

&gt; By implication, Williams also suggests strongly that such allegations are the product of the propaganda department of the Sunni insurgents seeking to overthrow Bashar al-Assad.

Suggests strongly being a single sentence in the entire blog post, pointing out simply that the opposition has a very good propaganda department?

&gt; The BBC again acted as a vehicle for such propaganda, despite knowing that the photo had been supplied by an “activist” and that it could not be independently verified.

Which is why BBC reports always state that such footage/photos has not been independently verified. It's standard practice for the BBC.

Here are some episodes I recommend watching

Season 2 episode 5 - The Girl in the Fireplace
Season 3 episode 1 - The Runaway Bride
Season 3 episode 11 - Blink (if you want to understand how time works)

A two part adventure that really helps explain how the doctor thinks, it breaks my fucking heart every time.
Season 3 episodes 9 and 10 - Human Nature and The Family of Blood

If you liked 'The Runaway Bride' than you will like this one too
Season 4 episode 2 - Partners in Crime

Actually season 4 is my favorite season so I would recommend all of them to you. I really hope you give the Doctor another try and let us know what you think after you watch some better episodes.

Ivanovic is a pure CB, through and through...despite being played at RB. Last season, the /r/chelseafc frontpage was consistantly littered with angry sentiments and the shit talking of Bosingwa. The reason we had him, and played him was due to him having the pace of keeping up with the likes of Ribery etc, as well storming forward on counters.

Bosingwa wasn't played because he was better than Ivanovic...but because he was a RB. I think Ivanovic could easily play RB next season, but if we have the means and ability to buy a true RB...we should not be content. As for Maicon...he's rather old for such an ageing squad, but could easily get the job done.

Edit: It's rather insulting to be downvoted into oblivion by people that have no knowledge of football..but just slap on a jersey and call themselves 'hardcore'.

I absolutely agree. I have a motorcycle (and car) licence, so I know this only too well. But this doesn't alter the fact that it is still *my responsibly* to drive safely. Speed cameras, and red light cameras for that matter, don't help me do this. They distract me, if anything.

&gt; lower speeds reduce injury.

So does banning driving altogether, but we're trying to establish a reasonable compromise here. And my quibble is with speed limits that are also unreasonable and a system that benefits from creating more and more them. (For clarity, I'd like to point out that I'm not against speed limits in general.)

&gt; And not speeding does solve several problems.

You keep talking about ""speeding"". I'm curious: are you talking about breaking the speed limit (a legal distinction), or driving at a dangerous speed?

&gt; [not speeding] stops you from getting points on your license,

There's that circular logic again! The problem isn't that I get points on my licence. The problem is that we have a system that *benefits* from putting points on my licence and, as a result, tries to make it more and more difficult for me drive and *not* break its rules.

&gt; it helps to ensure that you won't get blamed in an accident that otherwise wasn't your fault and it helps keep your insurance costs down

true,ghostridethewhip,null,null,"The thing that bothers me about the RB market right now is some of the names being tossed about (Van Der Wiel, Azpilicueta, Piszczek) are just average players in a position extremely short on talent. There are really only three world class talents at RB, and those players are Maicon, Lahm, and Dani Alves.

There are others who are alright or who could potentially be good in the future (names like Kyle Walker, Micah Richards, and Danilo come to mind). The problem is that the prices for RBs are going to be majorly inflated because the pool of players to choose from is so relatively limited. If you have a world class team and you want a world class RB to play on that team, you are going to have to pay some crazy money for them because there are 8-10 teams in for three or four great players. As such, some of the elite teams are going to settle for the next highest rung of talent and still probably pay big money for them.

I think it is totally ridiculous to be tossing around a figure like 12m for a player like Azpilicueta or Van Der Wiel. Watch a few of the Marseille/Lille matches from last season to see how Azpilicueta handled defending a player of Hazard's caliber (protip- he got his ass handed to him). Just because he is a young RB does not mean he is a good RB or that we should sign him.

In my opinion, we should keep Ivanovic on the right side and sign a few young, top RB talents from a lower league English team on the cheap to back him up and ease into the squad. I'm talking 3-4mil max. People may not like Ivanovic at RB, but he was an integral part of our run in the Champs League last season (see: Napoli second leg). He is great going forward, scores some wonderful goals at important times, provides the forwards with great service when overlapping on the wing, and most importantly, he is an excellent defender who is adept at using his strength to negate the pace of opposing wingers.

TL;DR- People want to sign RBs with average talent for outrageous, inflated prices. Sign a few backups on the cheap and leave Ivanovic be.",0,1339787425,null,0,false,0,c513d4m,t3_v3dif,t1_c513d4m,t3_v3dif,null,1429151776,9,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,9

""Nonsense. Every media pirates know how to to get around these measures, it's utterly trivial. It will only catch the clueless and the false positives, neither of whom are doing any notable damage to anything.""

- Media pirates will certainly get around it. However, I wasn't talking about media pirates. If they can identify a few person or persons conspiring to commit terrorism - realistic target like [bombing the London Stock Exchange](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16833032) then that would save us billions. Even if they find ways around it, man is always prone to making mistakes. I'm not saying this would be common - it would only need to be once. 


""Again wrong. Recently the US twitter/facebook watch list was forced to be revealed, as was the web one. They are far from selective. Trigger enough keywords and you'll be flagged for some form of investigation.""

- Come on, the US defence budget is $851 billion. The UK has £37.5 billion. The amount of manpower and budget the UK could realistically give to this is simple not comparable to the US. 


""The complexity has zero bearing on the morality.""

-The question of the thread is on cost, not morality. 

What is actually likely is that this will get either overturned or limited to the point of impotence by the Courts - either ours or Brussels. It will also bitterly divide Parliament and will very likely cause irrecoverable damage to the Coalition agreements.

You mean those who have been convinced or paid to join a fake plan concocted by the intelligence services? You do know they are doing this, approaching as many easily influenced idiots and cajoling them into involvement? Almost every single high-profile ""plot"" in the UK and USA since 2001 has been this way. Some Muslims have made formal complaints because they are sick of being approached by these people trying to turn them into ""terrorists""! The one you link was just like that, as was the ""fertilser bomb"" guys arrested a few years back.

The actual threat is pretty small and those capable of doing it without undercover agents providing them with absolutely everything are not going to be using Facebook or Twitter.

The two groups work closely together and always have regarding electronic surveillance. The yanks run a huge facility at Menworth Hill that taps into the UKs satellite communications and they give the brits the ""take""  from it. Both groups also use it for industrial espionage, giving stolen company secrets to favoured companies or ones they themselves own, that alone justifies the US expense on it. But I'm sure that won't be a problem with the new system...it's not like we have a government or police service with a history of selling secrets!

While you are probably likely to win if you are reasonably articulate and actively fight the advise has previously been to detune or modify the equipment to prevent prosecution. I'd assume that changed with the digital switch over for non-digital sets though. 

The television is very clearly a television and not a monitor (being considerably larger than 23 inch). Otherwise I have similar equipment to you (non Apple phone aside). I do all my television watching online. 

DAB radio is fantastic - and legitimately free. 

(The other weird thing about free access to BBC services is the business with the license being needed to watch things online at the time they are broadcast but not afterwards.

&gt;The law states that you need to be covered by a TV Licence if you watch or record television programmes, on any device, as they're being shown on TV. This includes TVs, computers, mobile phones, games consoles, digital boxes and Blu-ray/DVD/VHS recorders.

&gt;**You don't need a licence if you don't use any of these devices to watch or record television programmes as they're being shown on TV - for example, if you use your TV only to watch DVDs or play video games, or you only watch ‘catch up’ services like BBC iPlayer or 4oD.**

Given the above, given that TVL have no legal authority to enter your property without the permission of a court - something that's pretty difficult to achieve, and given that the so-called ""Detector Vans"" don't work with digital transmissions [and their validity / ability to detect analogue signals was questionable] ""inferring use"" is only really viable if you live in a house / ground floor apartment, and have your TV viewable from the window.

&gt;The television is very clearly a television and not a monitor (being considerably larger than 23 inch). Otherwise I have similar equipment to you (non Apple phone aside). I do all my television watching online.

You can have an apartment full of 40"" TVs if you want - the legislation, as outlined clearly states that it's only when those TVs are hooked upto an input - i.e aerial, digital receiver etc, etc, that you need a licence to own 'em.

It doesn't take much to get rid of TVL - a quick email / letter sent via recorded delivery outlining the reason[s] why you don't need a licence, and if applicable, requesting a refund on unused quarters of your licence.

Depending on how TVL feel, that's usually good enough for 2 - 5 years.  I started receiving letters from 'em a few weeks ago, after a gap of numerous years - I simply typed up a statement confirming my situation, had it witnessed, and sent it through to them. Received a letter saying that they ""might send an officer round"", which is unlikely, but if they were to do so, on principal I'd refuse to allow the person to enter the property unless they consented to being recorded.

However, the following paid maternity leave may only be taken by the mother. What if the father is to be the 'stay at home carer'? Those 'maternity' rights are non-transferrable. This is an injustice on both parties.

true,[deleted],null,null,"(None of the following is directed at you, just so you know ;) )

I couldn't care a less what people think. Making my leg ""in your face so you can't ignore it"" is the same as hiding it. Its still just living my life based on what others think of me. 

To be honest, I think that it is mostly non-amputees who think about the ""existential aspects of being an amputee"". I just don't think about it much any more. Its not the center of my daily existence. It is seriously in my mind the same as wearing glasses. Do glasses wearers try to hide their glasses? No. Do they try to deck them out so that they ""tell the world"" that they aren't ashamed of wearing glasses? Sometimes. But most people just put them on in the morning and forget they have them on. When their glasses do something that makes it so they can't forget they have them on, it is as annoying as fuck.

You know what the worst part about being an amputee. Way worse than the disability itself. Its that every time I wear shorts the whole world thinks that the one thing I want to do at that moment is talk to them about being an amputee. God forbid I want to just go on a bike ride. No, if I ride my bike with shorts then going on a bike ride means answering every question of every idiot that sees my leg and thinks he is being so progressive in asking me questions. 

I mean perfect strangers just walk up to me and start asking me all sorts of personal questions like they have some license to know about my life experience. Think about it this way...how would you feel if every time someone saw your glasses they walked up to you and said. ""Hey man, can you tell me about your glasses? How did your eyes get bad? Is it hard living with glasses? Do you care about what other people think about your glasses? Man if I had glasses then I would totally get some funky ones that let out steam and shit just to show the world I don't care that I have glasses."" Seriously, the only reason people ask the questions is because the ""glasses"" freak them the hell out and they want to make their freaked out brain just a little more comfortable with the glasses by showing ""look how unafraid I am, I am asking questions and making jokes!"" 

The hardest part is being polite in these situations. I just want to tell them to buzz of most of the times...but then they will tell me I am a big jerk who should be thankful that they didn't stare. The worst is when people tell their kids to come talk to me and ask me questions. Now I am stuck being a jerk to a kid just because some adult thinks that my personal life is his kids business.

You wouldn't believe how hard it is to not isolate myself, not because I care what others think, but rather because any time I try to do anything...ride my bike, ski, go on a walk, whatever...it all becomes about my disability with other people. People treat me completely differently when they find out I have a fake leg. I always joke that I could walk down the street swearing, picking my nose, and rubbing my crotch and no one would notice if I was wearing shorts. 

If you want to learn more about life as a disabled person, rent a wheel chair and live in it for a month. Seriously, try it, you really should...it will be eye opening. Then after the first month look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself how you would feel if you had to re-experience every question, every interested person, every person just trying to be nice, just trying to ""understand your situation"" over and over and over and over and over again for the rest of your life. Having a disability isn't hard. Having to deal with people dealing with your disability is very hard. My own personal hell.

The worst is when I am having a ""bad leg day"" and need to use the disabled parking. People can't see I have a fake leg and razz me out for using the disabled spot. Seriously...I just want to tell people to fuck off so often. Fucking vultures.

The first series isn't that great because they were still sort of searching how to handle the reboot.

You have an incredibly interesting and mysterious main character, who's an *alien*, I mean come on, this alone is captivating.

He can travel through all of space of time instantly in his ship. (endless potential) 

He admires humans even though he can sometimes get a bit mad or disappointed in them too. 

He travels with companions, so there's always the human connection.

Explores interesting themes, a lot of them deal with identity and what makes a person a person (a human a human)

Because of the timetravel mentioned earlier, they can go into the past and into the future, which is awesome on itself. Visiting other planets and seeing different species also pretty awesome.

Great stories. There are some episodes with weaker episodes, but most have pretty great stories. Some WILL draw a tear out of you. 

Storyarcs. This is rather new to the reboot, but each series has a story arc. Which means you can start looking for little clues in earlier episodes and try to puzzle it all together before it even happens. 

Sci-fi. There's quite a bit of sci-fi in there too, don't worry! That said, there's fantasy in there too, best of both worlds combined.

The ancient and forever struggle of good versus evil. 

The show attempts to show what being human is all about, which is very interesting because we're allowed a sort of outside perspective on it all thanks to the Doctor. It mostly tries to show the good, but there's some less good stuff in there too!

There really isn't any debate, Kirchner thinks there is but I've not heard any support for her nonsense from anyone who matters and those who do matter universally recognise that the Falklands are British.  It's also well known that the offer of revenue sharing was proposed by the UK some time ago (since this presumably all comes down to Argentina wanting a share of the profits generated by the oil and gas offshore of the Falklands) but was quickly rejected.  The UK has done the decent thing and now doesn't have to pay any attention.

As much as I dislike Cameron, he is taking the correct stance on this issue.  There shall be no negotiation now Argentina have chosen to pursue such pettiness.

All she's achieving is riling up a bit of anti-UK sentiment amongst likeminded idiots and is in no way furthering her wacky goal of retaking the islands.  She doesn't have the best PR team I suspect because the more she complains the less legitimate she seems as a leader to the rest of the world.

true,OhWhyBother,null,null,"I don't agree with the post but the 'Ivanovic at RB' saga is a little more complicated that meets the eye.

Ivanovic has stated on multiple occasions that he prefers playing CB but is happy to play at RB for Chelsea because he is needed there. He has always put in a good shift in the RB position but that's about it. Moreover, we have only been able to compare him with Bosingwa and Paulo - not great comparison, you'll agree? 

Here's where things start getting tricky.

* Buying a **proper RB** like Azpilicueta or Debuchy would mean reduced playing time for Ivanovic at CB - he's clearly fourth in the CB pecking order after JT, Luiz and Cahill. Moreover, he'd also drop to second-choice at RB. 

    For someone who has been a fuckin' tank for Chelsea in the 2011-12 UCL run, this would be a heart-breaking demotion. :(
* Buying a **budding RB** like VdW or such would mean Ivanovic gets to play regularly at least BUT as an RB - not his first-choice position, which is CB. Add to that, our defensive woes at the position won't be alleviated much by buying young untested talent either.

Chelsea &amp; Ivanovic are in a precarious position:

Areas that are good to live in/not so good:  I would avoid Granton and Leith personally, as for where's good I will defer to my more experienced bretheren.  West End is lovely, but will be hellishly expensive.  

Cable/ISP/Telephone - I would recommend Virgin for at least the first two if your area is fibre optic cabled, but you might need to check that.  I'm with O2 at the moment and they seem to be pretty solid - £17 for unlimited downloads and a phone line however this was a special offer we got when we joined up.  

Banks:  Bank of Scotland.  My better half works for them. I've been with them for 12 years and they are absolute gentlemen and ladies when it comes to customer service.  Any problems you encounter with them can usually be fixed with a brief phone call and they have excellent and helpful staff in branch too.  I would personally avoid Royal Bank of Scotland, as my better half also worked there and was a customer for a while until they messed him about one too many times.

The other topics I will leave to people who are more knowledgeable about certain areas.  For the landlord one though - just make sure you don't go with Grant Management.

Which area you want to live in depends on what you're looking for. Are you looking for somewhere central? Tenement buildings such as in Tollcross will generally be cheaper but noisier, beautiful stone buildings such as those in New Town will be quieter but more expensive. Know that Edinburgh is a student city and some areas will have a very large % of drunk students roaming around at all time of the night. 

Decent areas: New Town, Morningside, Polwarth, 

Decent but quite a high % of students: Bruntsfield, Marchmont, Newington

Decent but a bit further out: Merchiston, Bonnington/Broughton/Warriston

You know, really Edinburgh is pretty great place to live and there are lots of good neighbourhoods. Just stay out of Niddrie, Wester Hailes, Sighthill/Stenhouse/Saughton and you'll be doing ok.

Leith has a bad reputation but it has some great spots in it so don't be put off, especially around the top of Leith walk. If you want to go even further out I bet you could find great value in places like Portobello, but I was always fairly central and spent the last 5 years in Tollcross.

true,Vordreller,null,null,"It's just a theory of mine, based on how the show has been using self-creating events and crossing of timelines in reverse order.

The Multiform mocked the doctor for not knowing where the cracks in the skin of the universe came from, implying that it did know where they came from, slash, how they were created. It was also the first creature to ever say the words ""silence will fall"". The next time we heard these words was during ""The Pandorica Opens"", when River was stuck in the TARDIS. And then it became the theme of the ending of the next season.

I'm thinking this might be something similar to how River is meeting the Doctor in the wrong order. Her future is his past and vice versa. The Multiform could very well be a creature that has seen it all happen before, in its personal timestream. It is then surprised The Doctor doesn't know what's going on and mocks him for it. Expecting him to understand but he does not. Expecting it, because maybe the Multiform has seen the Doctor find out or maybe just heard about the Doctor solving the problem of the cracks. But not this Doctor. An older Doctor.

It would be a nice paradox: The greatest threat the doctor ever faced, the revealing of ""the secret"".

Drogba was 26 when we signed him, and he got a hell of a lot better in the following 5-6 seasons before slowing down last year. Lamps/Terry/Malouda all had their best seasons in their late 20s/early 30s as well.

Maybe Maicon wasn't considered ""world class"" in his early 20s, but Dani Alves was a world beater with Sevilla at 20 years old and certainly showed more potential than any of the players listed above. I would say the only young RB anybody is talking about that has the potential to be a true world class talent in the future is Danilo of Porto (just signed him, €50M release clause) and maaayyyybe Kyle Walker (no chance Tottenham would sell him to their crosstown rivals). Just my opinion of course.

I'm concerned because watching a decent amount of Azpilicueta has shown me that he is not a good enough player for Chelsea, and Van Der Wiel seems more like a default option and an average talent than a great signing. Like I said before, just because a player is young does not mean they are good. If there isn't a good enough RB for Chelsea on the market (and I'd argue that there is not, unless we're gunning for Lahm or Alves), I think it would be dumb to sign anybody other than a very young, very cheap prospect to backup Ivanovic.",0,1339812749,null,0,false,0,c518q4p,t3_v3dif,t1_c518q4p,t1_c515kjw,null,1429154368,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

**Favorite Doctor:** Tennant** 
**Favorite Companion:** Amy 
**Favorite Episode:** 
**Favorite Season:** 6th (The latest season)
**Favorite Writer:** Moffat
**Favorite Villain:** The Master, he is just silly and great
**Favorite Guest:** Captain Jack here at your service

**Least Favorite Doctor:** out of the three, then the 9th, but I love him as well just wish he was in more episodes with better budget and all. All three are great.
**Least Favorite Companion:** Martha (before the season 3 finale) She just reminded me of another Rose who loved the Doctor, but the Doctor just didn't care. After the Master and her combat training I thought she was a bit better. 
**Least Favorite Episode:** Theres a handful, the T.V. Episode in season 2. The bee episode with Agatha Christie in season 4. 
**Least Favorite Season:** Again the first season, though I don't hate it, it was just the lowest budget and the worse writting out of them all. I still liked it though.
**Least Favorite Writer:** not sure, don't feel like looking back to find out
**Least Favorite Villain:** The mother fucking Slitheen, I almost considered stopping the show just because of how lame that was.

It should be beaten into every Liverpool fans mind right now, that Rodgers system will take at LEAST 6 months to show any results. This is a Barca-esque system, it will take a long time to bed in between the under agers and the reserves. Some of our more illustrious players will probably struggle with it (Looking at you Mr. Hollywood pass Gerrard).

Finally, we know these players are quality, the fact that they haven't performed in one season collectively is unfortunate, but happens. One of the players I'm excited to see under Rodgers is Henderson, he seems like he has the skills to succeed. I think, as an Irish fan I'll live by my mantra that's served me well for 10 years of seriously watching and analysing football.

true,michael_ellis_day,null,null,"What happened in ""Father's Day"" wasn't a fixed point in time.  The problem was that Rose, having personally witnessed something happen (the death of her father) then went back in time and made it not happen. It was her having been present there that made it part of her personal timeline, and looping back and unmaking it created a logical paradox.  This caused space-time to break down and the Reapers could come into our dimension.

""Waters of Mars"" was a whole other situation. If the Doctor had been there, seen how things turned out, left everybody dead...and then went back in time and did different stuff to change his own past so that everyone lived, then it would have been the same thing as ""Father's Day"" and it would have created a logical paradox.  

At the end of ""Father's Day"" things have been restored with a very slight change of events -- Pete Tyler didn't die alone -- and the rest of history flowed around that very minor change, so that Rose as a little girl was now told something different by her mother and, so far as Rose as an adult is concerned, things were always that way.

The amount needed before moving does need to be looked at in more detail. And it will vary dependent on the locations cost of living.

Also, with regards to applying for jobs in other towns. How do folk go about this? Is it a case of holding interviews via skype/telephone. Or do you travel to them and have a face to face interview.

I can imagine it being wise to try and line up a few interviews in the same day and travel in to go through them all. But in the current climate being so choosy about interview dates would make it impossible.

You raise some very good points. It is very hard indeed to construct a survey that is completely free of bias, and I greatly appreciate your criticisms. I will reiterate some of them in my final paper, in a list of possible biases to my research.

Your proposed system of having a grid of social networks seems like an excellent idea. The problem for me is the matter of feasibility; for this research I only have the time and means to survey one network, it being reddit.

Also, I did try to make it as neutral as possible, by both asking ""On reddit, I find it *harder*..."" and ""On reddit, I find it *easier*..."". However, as you rightly point out, that does not suffice to get rid of any possible bias, since it is clear to any bright respondent what my paper is about and what I'm trying to research.

Thank you for your time and criticisms!",0,1339833715,null,0,false,0,c51c0q8,t3_v3rqu,t1_c51c0q8,t1_c51bmqt,null,1429155923,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,geekchic,null,null,"&gt; I don't think it matters where they operate from. What should happen is, any money made in any country by a company, should be taxable at that country's tax rate.

As it happens, that is exactly what does happen.

However, thanks to your elected politicians wanting to write ever more complex tax laws to favour their preferred electors/unions/companies, they have ended up with a system that makes it surprisingly complex to decide where money is made now.

For example, if I buy something in the UK via the internet from a company based in Luxembourg, where is that taxed?

Obviously I pay VAT here in the UK, but should the company pay corporation tax in the UK or in Luxembourg? It is a Luxembourg company, so it should pay tax where *it* made the money, which from its perspective is in Luxembourg.

You might argue that as the sale occurred in the UK that it made the money in the UK so should pay taxes here on that one sale, but it is essentially impossible to split out corporate profit/loss on a per transaction basis.

In fact, the only way a company could be taxed entirely at the point of sale and not at the point where it operates from is to abolish corporation tax entirely, and massively hike VAT instead.

Somehow I doubt that would be appreciated.

So, the point is that taxation is very complex - in part because we the electorate put people into power who design the tax code that way, and in part because it is always going to be impossible to break group corporation tax down to per-transaction level.",0,1339833744,null,0,false,0,c51c0uc,t3_v38v4,t1_c51c0uc,t1_c515ryz,null,1429155924,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

How about a job in Munich via an agency? If you've got a UK passport you can even go there, stay with friends and look for a job since you don't need a residence/work permit. The other option is to go there and study German. It's a good place, though you will tend to find your friends are 90% other foreigners rather than Germans. Though I know people who have worked in Berlin and they said that people are much more friendly there.

Also I liked Stockholm a lot. The people are much nicer than the people in Munich.

I'd avoid smaller Swedish cities because they are stultifying, though the idea of working in Åre has a certain appeal.

&gt; What areas are good to live in and what areas should we avoid?

Where you live really depends on your income, and there are a lot of areas in Edinburgh, far too many to list comprehensively here. As a general rule, the way to tell whether an area is affluent (which is usually synonymous with safe and good) or not is to use Google Maps and StreetView, and look out for the people:cars ratio. For example, Cables Wynd houses about a thousand people in a singular giant apartment block, and has a carpark with spaces for about ten cars. It is a shithole. Meanwhile, Ravelston Dykes weighs in with roughly a 1:1 ratio, and that's with luxury vehicles, too. It is lovely, but very expensive.

Still, rules are only a guide. You're welcome to keep coming back and asking us questions.



&gt;    Recommendations on great cable/ISP/telephone providers (already have mobile accounts with Vodaphone from when we were in London on an extended holiday).

O2 (or Be - same company, same network, but slightly different pricing between the two) offer excellent service in our city. Edinburgh actually ranks as the city with the highest average internet speeds in all of the UK, and O2/Be do seem to do their bit to bring up the numbers. 

As a note, whether you opt for Virgin or O2 (or any other provider) depends slightly on how far you'll be from your local exchange. With Virgin, distance isn't an issue, but with other providers, it can be. Most ISPs offer connection speed estimates if you can give them the post code of your building, and it's worth checking that out before you commit to a contract. Some parts of town can be a fair distance from their exchanges, and suffer relatively slow internet as a result. 




&gt;    Where to find good doctors/dentists/vets (bringing our 2 kitties)?

For Doctors, I would say the Stockbridge PCT. I've had nothing but good from them, although my doctor has since retired. Dentists and vets, I've no idea.


&gt;    What's preferrable, letting agents or private landlords?

It's debatable.



&gt;    What bank do you prefer?

I have accounts with RBoS, Natwest, Nationwide, Britannia, Santander, and Bank Of Scotland, and I would rate Bank Of Scotland the best. I've never had a problem with them, their interest rates are reasonable, their online banking system works well and effectively, their branches are numerous and staff are usually efficient and friendly, and they've gone the extra to help me out when I've been in a jam, like recently when I found myself stuck in Dunfermline, with no money to get home, and nothing apart from my work's ID badge to show who I was. 

The other banks have all offended me in some way. RBoS, Natwest, Nationwide have lousy interest rates, or accounts that will happily lapse into 0% interest after a certain amount of time, and Santander are just the most disorganised, idiotic collection of mentally defective sub-human  masses of congealed shit known to man. Not only should you avoid this bank, but if you ever meet anyone claiming to work for them, you should set them on fire, and run extremely fast.

You will want to live somewhere fairly close to the centre of town if you wish to take full advantage of nightlife restaurants etc. Good areas to look at include Newington, Tollcross, Morningside, Marchmont. The New Town is very expensive for rent. Leith has a more ""colourful"" reputation than most other central areas but should be cheaper rent wise. I lived in Leith for 10+ years and have to say I loved it.
    Bruntsfield, Baberton, Juniper Green, Currie, Balerno are pretty much in suburbs, great if you want a quiet life but obviously makes things a bit more tricky if you want nightlife etc.

You will have stacks of options for ISPs, personally use Virgin myself but is not available in all areas. Look for the best start up deal.

There will be a number of GP surgeries in most areas. Have a look at a few and decide, you can always transfer to another if you don't like.
Dentists can be tricky to register for as a NHS patient, you may wish to get some private dental insurance. I would recommend [this vet.
](http://www.braidvet.co.uk/) Not the cheapest but are excellent.

Long time since if had to deal with letting agencies or landlords, I will let others offer their opinions.

If you're living and working in the centre of town a car is probably more trouble than it's worth. We have a good public transport system which will probably get you to your destination as quick, and hell of a lot less stressed, than a car. Parking in Edinburgh can be a headache/expensive or both. There are also car share schemes/clubs available. If you do decide to go for the public transport option get a [bus pass.](http://www.lothianbuses.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1014)Very good value for money, especially when you consider that petrol costs about £1.35 per LITER!!
Also if you're of a sporty persuasion [look here.](http://www.edinburghleisure.co.uk/detail-70)

You'll have no trouble finding coffee shops, pubs, restaurants, delis, that you like, there are certainly enough to try. As you are probably aware pubs play a big part in Scottish social life, finding a good one is important :-), when you have settled on an area post and I'm sure you'll have many suggestions (and offers of pints.)

Most of all enjoy it, Edinburgh really is a wonderful cosmopolitan city, you will meet people from all over the world here, and even some of the natives are cool:-)

true,expatrat,null,null,"American who has been living in the UK many years here. A lot of smugness on this thread. I agree Britain is a great place to live for many reasons, and in its own way very tolerant. But this is not a diverse country at all. 

Look up the stats, UK is more than 90% white, and when Brits criticise Americans for talking about being ""Irish"" or whatever, they betray a huge misunderstanding of what it means to be American. 

Virtually everyone I know (or knew) in America had strong ethnic ties to another country. My own parents for example, are from another country. 

Mocking them for ""I'm Irish, that must be why I like potatoes"" when they've never been to Ireland may seem like a clever thing to do, but it's actually incredibly ignorant. 

Yes- America is an idea. More so than virtually any other country. It doesn't mean I think America is perfect, or has no racism. It does mean something though. 

For example, being born on American soil means you are an American citizen. That is not true in the UK (although many mistakenly believe it to be so). 

Another example, there are nearly as many Americans of Hispanic/Latino origin as there are Britons.  That means that there are more than 50 million Americans who speak Spanish and identify with another country/culture while still feeling American. 

To be American means to be of multiple cultures, and virtually every single American understands this, and it is nearly impossible to explain to non-Americans who are wrapped up in hundreds or thousands of years of identity politics of a different sort entirely.

Don't mention the trams). So from that point of view, if you are staying in the city there isn't much need for a car unless you work in the outskirts, such as Sighthill. However for a good Driving instructor, 'Driving's Cool' use really nice Minis to drive and you can request a female instructor.
As for TV/Internet providers I've found there isn't much difference between them. You can use moneysupermarket.com to compare prices, though I have heard Virgin/Sky are not th greatest.
Good doctors? Thanks to the NHS there isn't much difference between them but the Conan Doyle Medical centre caters to Newington and they are slightly unusual in the sense it is always very easy to get an appointment. For vets I would recommend Braid vets as they have a 24 hour centre in case there are any emergencies.
Letting agents tend to be a lot safer, though don't go for the ones that are TOO big as they can be very impersonal and take a while to fix things. I would recommend Capital Lettings, a little family owned company where one of the sons is a handyman so stuff gets sorted very quickly.

Having a car isn't essential for day to day life in the city. It's pretty easy to get around by bus and walking. In the centre of the city it's probably easier not to have a car (congestion and lack of parking). However there are really beautiful places to see outside of Edinburgh that are a lot easier to get to by car.

I can't recommend a driving school, haven't tried to learn to drive on the opposite side of the road (or a manual) yet.  
There are a lot of great places to grab tea/coffee. I'm still exploring them. I'm more of a tea person, so I can't vouch for their coffee but I like Eteaket and Anteaques.

&gt; Armando Iannucci, Facts and Fancies, 1997
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  The world is composed of many examples of the faintly ludicrous, but for the most part we turn a blind eye to the incongruities.  Sport, the Vatican, a Geneva Convention on the recognised rules of way, hula hoops, ties, and the hats middle-aged ladies wear at weddings, are all faintly absurd concepts, but when viewed through squinted eyes just about get away with making some sort of sense.  So we grant them the benefit of the doubt and decide just to get stuck in and enjoy them.  This used to be what we did to the Windsors, we made them regal and then asked them to perform.  But now, something indefinable has happened which has ruthlessly forced us to stare down at them with wider and more unbelieving eyes.  **And deep down, I think more of us know that it now doesn't matter which way the succession passes.  Whoever succeeds the Queen will have had a weird education, a weird voice, a weird marriage, weird hobbies and a weird walk.  And more and more of us will find it deeply unlikely that we could ever curtsey or bow to him without quietly but continuously laughing in his face.**

true,blueocean43,null,null,"Ok, lets do this point by point:

1) Owning a car: Check the[ lothian bus route map](http://lothianbuses.com/find-your-bus/route-maps.html). If you have two or more busses going to the area you will be living, no, you don't need a car. There is nowhere to park it anyway.

2)Best place for coffee: Depends what you like in a coffee shop. For tea, I like Anteaques, which is a cross between an antiques shop and a tea shop and only open 3 days a week. For coffee, there red coffee stands that are scattered near the university are generally good. The Elephant house is nice offpeak, but I'm not entirely sure its possible to go in without a macbook and a novel to loudly tell strangers about how you will totally get round to writing it soon. There is a milkshake place on george IVth bridge that's quite good, but better for milkshakes than coffee. Tea Tree Tea on Bread Street is nice, and occasionalyl has randoms wandering and playing guitar.

3) Driving school: Not the foggiest. Don't really need to drive unless you live outside the bus route anyway.

4)Good areas to live: Well, depends how much you want to pay, and where he's working. If he's working in South Gyle (there is a huge buisness park there, everyone seems to work there) then Corstorphine is not too bad, and a bit cheaper than the city centre. If you are loaded, morningside is lovely, as are some of the roads near queen street and carlton hill road. The next step down would be Marchmont, Tollcross, Newington, Bruntsfield, and some of the most southern areas of leith (the new houses, not the old). Further out, there are nice areas in Rosyln, Newhaven or Crammond. Areas to avoid like the plauge are Muirhouse, the Inch, up near the docks, by the hospital, Wester Hailes, and Oxgang. A quick look on google streetview will probably tell you what you need to know about an area, if there are tower blocks or everything is pale grey, run down concrete, stay away.

5) Internet: [BE](https://www.bethere.co.uk/web/beportal/homepage) are good, but don't forget to unclude the cost of a BT landline. Virgin Media are piles of steaming shite who oversell so badly, the internet doesn't work between about 7 and 10pm. 

6) Doctor: Depends where you are living, but Meadows Medical Practice have been brilliant for me. Vets: I've never yet found a bad one. I can recommend the West End Vetinary Partnership.

7) Letting agents v.s. private: We have gone an odd route of a letting agent owned by the landlord, which works really well for us (Zoltie Estates). Ryden Lettings take ages to fix anything (3 months to fix the boiler), lied about the oven being new (was badly refurbished second hand and broken), and didn't return most of our deposit despite no damage to the flat (apparently it was a £200 bill for cleaning the skirting boards and outsides of the windows). From what i've heard, this still makes them better than Grant Management. So basically, as a general rule, go private. You may get a bad apple, but it's usually better.

8) RBS branches are never fucking open (9am till 5pm weekdays, and a few hours early saturday morning), Halifax you never know if they are open as the website keeps breaking (along with the online banking). In fact, the branch finder is broken right now. There are no good banks. Lloyds gave me champage just for walking into their lovely, marble floored central branch once though.

true,veronicacrank,null,null,"&gt;Where you live really depends on your income, and there are a lot of areas in Edinburgh, far too many to list comprehensively here.

Last night I started panicking because of the cost of rent/council tax/utilities.  How much does the average household bring in before taxes?  My husband has a job already, making between £50-60,000 per year (can't remember the exact number at the moment) and in looking at rent + council tax + utilities, I'm starting to feel like it's not enough.  Am I crazy?  I am going to look for a job when I get there and am settled but I know I won't bring in anything close to what he will be making and I don't know how long it will take to find a job.

He told me last night that he doesn't want to have to take a bus to get to and from work (but for some reason a train from Glasgow vs a 20 minute bus ride is preferrable...He was a little high but I think my husband is fucked) so we are going to have to find something near Haymarket/Dalry/Gorgie or Old Town so that he can walk to work or ride his bike.  Are those areas ok?  When I was there in April/May, I took a walk down Gorgie Road (my grandmother was born on and grew up on Wardlaw Street and she wanted me to get her a picture of it) and some places looked nice but I felt it was a little rough around the edges.  I liked Old Town but it might be a bit too touristy for our liking.  I loved Stockbridge and Bonnington but I think they are going to too far away from his office and possibly too expensive.  I love the idea of Leith (I've always lived within viewing distance of the ocean) but I know that's too far for his liking.

With the council tax, which is similar to our property taxes, in Canada, the owners of the property pay it or adjust the rent accordingly to cover at least some of the costs.  Is it normal for the tenants to pay the council tax?  With water/electricity/heat, are these things that are normally included in the rent or is the tenant required to pay these as well?  Right now, we just pay for hydro (electricity) but our water and heat is included, which is pretty standard.  I know that in London, from a friend of my husband, you are required to pay the water and electricity for the entire year, is this the same in Edinburgh?  What is the average cost per month for water/electricity/heat?

I am so sorry for all these questions.  I had a real panic attack about all this last night.  Almost to the point of thinking that it might not work out at all for us.  I'm ok with trying it and then coming back home if it doesn't work, life's an adventure right?, but it not working out before we can even try it would be devastating.",0,1339862733,null,0,false,0,c51eyp9,t3_v47bn,t1_c51eyp9,t1_c51cbux,null,1429157372,1,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,1

true,Atomicide,num22,,"Everyone points this out, and this is a quote from the article, and it is wrong. I will explain why this is wrong. 

**""With the score at 1-1, Rednapp made a change. But instead of the extra striker that was needed to grab a vital winner, he threw on Scott Parker and played for the draw.""**

Redknapp was not playing for a draw, if he wanted to play for a draw he would have made the substitution much earlier. If he really felt the need to defend the draw he would have subbed Parker on as soon as possible after we scored. Instead he waited 28 minutes to ""defend the draw"" and used **ONE** defensive player. If you are down to 10 and want to protect what you have you throw on an extra defender and/or a defensive midfielder.

Redknapp was also not playing to win. If he had wanted to win, he would have made an attacking substitution in a match we were dominating with 10 men. By bringing on a fresh forward, and even shoring us up safely with the Scott Parker sub he could have had the best of both worlds. Fresh legs for a 10 man team is a big difference.

Redknapp didn't want to lose the game because that just doesn't make sense. However his substitution was worthless, not because it was the wrong sub, but because it was made when the match was effectively over. You can't factor what ifs and fluke circumstances (say Parker miraculously being on the line to make a goal-line clearance in the 95th minute).

The cold hard facts are 1 sub played 6 minutes. Instead of 2 subs playing 20+ minutes and one sub playing about 6 minutes.

Redknapp didn't try to win or draw the match. He wouldn't try to lose the match either. Therefore the conclusion is that Redknapp bottled it and had no idea what the fuck to do. He literally made no impact on the game at all.

Interestingly I think the same holds for other brilliant radio 4 comedies transferred to TV (Mitchell &amp; Webb, Genius, I've Never Seen Star Wars etc).

Oh god, please not this guy.

EDIT:
&gt;Tom McRae semi-joked about being the next showrunner just recently. MacRae brought back the Cybermen in 2006’s The Rise of the Cybermen/The Age of Steel, a villain which became hugely popular in later series. 2011’s The Girl Who Waited was also a huge success and was one of the most popular episodes of Doctor Who to date.

I liked The Girl Who Waited but I think this guy would need to do a few more episodes before I can really get behind him. His episodes have been good but he hasn't really hit it out the park like Moffat did previously.



&gt;An outside chance. Despite the fact Gaiman has only written one episode for the revived series, The Doctor’s Wife has received near constant praise from fans, viewers and TV critics. Neil Gaiman is also a hugely popular sci-fi writer and carries many important traits. It is likely that he would be very capable of holding a complex plot together and tying up loose ends. His books have also been very popular. However, the biggest problem is the fact Gaiman has a busy schedule and currently lives in the United States.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I know an amazing driving instructor if you're interested, he's super super patient and nice, and he works for himself so you don't get landed with the stupid extra fees that you'll get if you go with a company like BSM. Shoot me a message if you're interested :) but you definitely don't need a car to live in Edinburgh. If you live and work in the city center, it might actually be more hassle to own one - buses are great and regular. There's a City Car Club with cars everywhere, where you can rent cars by the hour if you need it. Also Edinburgh is a fantastic city to live in, you'll absolutely love it, no question! It's a great size, you can walk most places and the bus service is brilliant. People are nice, food is great, the festival is fun, what's not to love?

Be are great for internet - really fast, super customer service, no caps etc.

For coffee, go to Artisan Roast, no question!! They are superb, they actually supply loads of little gourmet places in Edinburgh with coffee. They have cafes on Bruntsfield Place and Broughton St.

If you're going to be working in Haymarket, then areas along Corstorphine Rd might be good to look at living in, but you can also get there pretty easily from nice areas like Bruntsfield, Viewforth and Polwarth. The West End and Dean Bridge might also be worth looking at. Or a bit further, Marchmont, Newington, Stockbridge, all these are nice and central, with great flats (although marchmont and Newington are pretty studenty). All these are nice areas with some awesome old tenement flats (which is what make up the majority of the housing in the centre of Edinburgh. I've lived in tenements the whole time I've been in Edinburgh - 6 years). As far as letting agents, I;m with EPM and they're fine. Private landlords are generally the way to go, although I've heard that DJ Alexander and Umega are pretty good.

I'm with Bank of Scotland, they are GREAT, branches everywhere, great customer service and really friendly. Never had a problem with them and I've banked with them all my life.
 
Based near Haymarket you're really close to the West End, Tollcross etc which are lively areas with lots of restaurants, cafes and pubs. Loudons is a really nice cafe on Fountainbridge which does good food, coffee and tea and has a little bakery of its own downstairs. Lebowskis is a cool bar, the Blue Blazer is a good local pub in Tollcross, and personally I love Under the Stairs, which is an amazing pub/bar with great food in a basement off Candlemaker Row (bit past Tollcross). You will find that pubs play a big part in Edinburgh life! Ooh and definitely try the Mosque Kitchen at some point, it's basic, kinda like a canteen, and cheap but you get great food. It's owned by the city mosque I think, and is really friendly and great. It's an institution in Edinburgh life! Kebab Mahal across the square is also really good. Hmm what else, I love the Brass Monkey on Drummond St as a pub, it has a huge back room with biiig sofas that are more like huge beds, really relaxed and fun atmosphere. 

If you are into second hand books, then take a walk along West Port past the Pubic Triangle (there are a few strip clubs/sex shops but it's fine to walk past), there is a rreally funny mix of amazing book shops right next to strip clubs. But I could spend all day browsing there :)

true,[deleted],null,null,"The peak age varies wildly by position. Center halves usually peak at around 30, strikers often peak as young as 24. Basically your game intelligence goes up as you get older and your physical attributes tend to decline. Terry and Lampard peaked later because neither depend on athleticism to any great degree, and both benefit hugely from game intelligence. Malouda just managed to keep his pace for a surprisingly long time, but looks poor now that he has lost it (only about 2 or 3 years later).

Its quite difficult to pinpoint the peak age for a fullback, largely because the position is played in different ways. Maldini (the greatest fullback ever and I will not hear any arguments to the contrary) peaked later in his career because his game was all about positioning and intelligence. He was never known for physical attributes. Contrast that with a player like Patrice Evra, who peaked far earlier due to his reliance on his pace.

What this is all building to is basically that I think we are essentially in agreement. I don't rate Danilo quite like you do, but I think of the players that have been mentioned, only Walker is a sensible purchase, and even that is borderline. I would rather see us do exactly what you described and buy a prospect for pocket change, and complement that with maybe one semi-established player (a cheap one) just for a little depth because Ivanovic always seems to get suspended.

true,[deleted],null,null,"glasgow - expensive where it's nice, shocking where it's really cheap. there's a happy medium in the west (partick/broomhill).. lots of colleges, lots of engineering/manufacturing employers and a really good subway system.

---
bristol - i've only lived in filton and that was really cheap but about 45 minutes walk from the centre. more intimate feel than glasgow, lots of aerospace manufacturing and some office jobs. massive culture thing going on with stokes croft and annual festivals.

---
newcastle - awesome town. from where you are, it's definitely an interesting call - check out sunderland etc if you're looking for work, bundles of big factories. busloads of lads come from the other three i've mentioned for stag nights - that should tell you something about the nightlife.

---
cardiff - cheap for what you get, nice crowd down there, mainly banking/insurance jobs popping up with manufacturing stuff further out in to the valleys. public transport isn't as good as newcastle or glasgow but you can walk just about anywhere in half an hour tops.

---
 advice - get a room in a shared house. paying for an entire flat for yourself is a mug's game and will cost you roughly twice as much, and good flatmates will introduce you to the town and keep you company. view at least two flats and pick the one with the best atmosphere, even if it costs you more. i move around a lot and use easyroommate.

there's absolutely nothing wrong with living with a landlord if they're young-ish and chilled out - if your boiler breaks, his boiler is broken too. this is the way i do everything now, and it tends to work out cheaper.

also, check out apprenticeships. the pay works out roughly the same, you get a decent qualification, work experience and pretty much a guaranteed job.
