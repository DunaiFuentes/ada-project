true,tobbern,null,null,"It took me a while to compose my thoughts and facts on this simply. Again, the show was never written in a logical structure. No show is. But, if we want to assume the facts can be constructed as such, then this is how I would explain it. 

It is both biological and social-scientific.

A Time Lord can, in theory, regenerate infinite times, or let's just assume 500 times because that is a nice big number. A Gallifreyan can't. This assumption is important because I think that, upon entering the Academy, the lords of the High Council impose the limit on the children. They gain the enlightenment or whatever in form of an education about the fabric of time. By attuning themselves to the rift in time, and by drawing upon the supernova Omega created, there is theoretically an infinite amount of energy to fuel all of Time Lord society and, I would conjecture, their very powers. That being said, their bodies cannot handle all that power. The 9th could not absorb the entire Time Vortex, so there is a physical restriction, and I would bet that it is a sheer limit of skin as matter cannot contain pure energy, especially energy that is multi-dimensional.

The High Council can place 'blocks' in Time Lord's minds. They can enforce policies on them as well. We know this because 

* 1. Time Lords are sworn to non-interventionism and,
* 2. Time Lords do not develop military technology that uses Time Lord science until the Last Time War

which means that 

* A. A militant Time Lord like the Master has no chance of fighting the entire Time Lord society because they have designed the system against him, and
* B. A pacifist Time Lord like the Doctor can be allowed to act as a rogue because we can assume he is rational enough to not start a lot of trouble as long as Time Lord society remains a sufficient deterrent

However, given a sufficient threat to Time Lord society, the High Council may break their own rules, as they did by offering the Master a new round of regeneration. This implies they had the power to do this (we assume they aren't lying) and that they could give him this power - suggesting it was not biological in the first place. It is already suggested that great founders of Time Lord society lived far longer than the Doctor did, and they must have had more regenerations than he did. This adds up so far.

How then can I argue that the High Council do this by using a mental block? Simple, because they have used it several times on him and the Master already. In the classical series, the 3rd Doctor was exiled to Earth and the High Council removed his knowledge needed to fix the Chameleon Circuit. This, they theorized, would confine him to Earth since he would no longer be able to move the TARDIS in a non-suspect fashion to other planets. The CC serves as camouflage after all, so this the first example of a Time Lord mental block.

The second is the new series' explanation of the Master's madness. The Time Lord council mentally altered the Master to become the soldier they needed to fight the Last Time War. He was revived, suggesting again the Council's power over regeneration limits, by retrieving him from Oblivion. The President of the Council, Rassilon, places the sound of drums in his head. This drives the Master mad. It is a block that prevents him from being focused and calm and kept him in the ""survival state"" they needed him to be, so that he could be manipulated for war. It also made him prioritize himself when the war went to shit. 

I think that all of this proves Time Lords, at least the Council, had power enough to severely alter the minds of fellow Time Lords, to give them new life, grant knowledge and in some cases, either close it or remove it entirely. The block could be psychic or knowledge-based. After all, Time Lords are said to be able to sense one another (9th says he knows 'in here' tapping on his head, and the Master makes similar comments when speaking to the 10th). If they had a collective consciousness or repository of knowledge, the Doctor lost access to knowledge about the Chameleon Circuit. Alternatively, the knowledge has just been locked away in part of his mind.

On a completely unrelated note, I believe the Doctor's mind was also altered to block the memory of finding and rebuilding the Key to Time, which would be the only tool in the universe able to open the Time Lock and allow the Doctor to change the destiny of the Time Lords. I am currently wrapping up my theory on why the new show writers chose to cut off the Time Lords and how they might undo it should the topic be considered hot enough to approach with the new audience.",0,1350742161,null,0,false,0,c6p8y9w,t3_11qx8i,t1_c6p8y9w,t1_c6ovrrg,null,1430196040,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

&gt;You have probably never heard of him.  Tom Ogle invented a vapor-fuel intake system, in 1977, for all automobiles.  His system could be affixed to any existing car engine, and would enable the car to travel 100 miles on one gallon of gas.  He claimed that the emissions were clean enough that you could dry your hair with the exhaust.  He astounded the auto industry with his invention, and was, in fact, approached in 1978 by a representative of Shell Oil, who offered him $20 million, on the spot, for the patent and plans to his invention.  He refused, stating flatly that Shell would simply shelve the idea and it would never see the light of day.

&gt;Tom Ogle was found dead from an apparent overdose of Darvon and alcohol poisoning on 19, August, 1981.  He had been known to drink, but never so heavily that he had to go to the hospital.  The Darvon is the weakest link to the report that his death was an accidental suicide: Darvon is an opioid painkiller.  It does nothing else, and Ogle had no history of using it. He also had no immediate history of pain requiring an opioid analgesic.  

&gt;The theory states that he was murdered by a Shell-hired assassin, who made it look like a suicide.  He actually got his fuel system patented, on 11 December, 1979, with patent number 4,177,179.  He was shot and wounded outside an El Paso, TX, bar earlier in the summer of 1981.  He claimed that people were after him for his patent.  
&gt;Three months after his death, his original schematics and blueprints went missing from the Patent Office in Washington, DC.  Some of his schematics have turned up on the Internet, but not enough have surfaced to actually build his device.

Definitely a spooky read but who knows how true it is.

Public transportation is cheaper in London, generally I agree. However the distances are much shorter on the tube than the distances I travel in Newcastle and Northumberland on the bus. Taxis however, are much cheaper via Blueline than black cabs or anything in Guildford/London.

Commodity items are likely the same in supermarkets, yes.

However the main component of cost of living is house prices and council tax. Both of which are significantly less in the North per sq meter. You can't just discount that from the argument.

Pints I have noticed are definitely cheaper in Newcastle. But that may just be because I don't just drink in the airport and the train station but all over the place.

true,Mr_Wolfgang_Beard,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Sorry I meant the other ""bullshit"" - untrue, lies, false, incorrect. Bullshit as in ""The statement that 2+2=3 is bullshit!"" I'll rephrase it:  
&gt;So what if a guy came up to us and said ""What are your religous beliefs?""  
You would say ""I don't have any."" and I would say ""I think religions are all completely wrong."" Am I not a gnostic atheist then?

I think the latter describes atheism pretty clearly. The first one could imply undecided or a vague faith in a deity.
&gt;Would you agree with me if I then suggested your *lack* of belief in my left big toenail was itself a belief *about* nailism

Yeah I would. My belief that your toenail is not divine is a belief about your toenail. It would be a belief about nailism. It's not a belief about christianity, or a political candidate, or the morality of tax evasion - it's a belief about nailism. It's not a belief *in* nailism, but it is a belief.  
If you don't think it's a belief about nailism then what do you think it is?

&gt;â equivalent to *my* belief in its divinity?

I don't understand why you keep bringing up equivalence of beliefs. Why does it matter how strong beliefs are relative to eachother. On the list of things I am absolutely certain about in this life, ""Antagony's toenail is not divine"" is a pretty fixed one. I firmly beleive that your toenail is utterly normal and not godly or worthy of worship. You may or may not have equally strong opposing beliefs. Why does that matter?

&gt;Opinions are not beliefs (in the religious sense) unless they are used as rules to live ones life by and/or to dictate to others how they should live theirs.

I would say that beliefs are strong opinions. I am strongly of the opinion that murder is immoral. I believe murder is immoral. What's the difference?

A team finally punished us fully for our little defensive mistakes that we've been getting away with. Chelsea are really impressive it has to be said. 

I'm more concerned with the injury to Mousa. If it's long term we are pretty well fucked because we have no one with the stamina or mobility to even come close to replicating his play. 

I've made my feelings about Lloris very clear. I'm not sure he would have saved any of those goals today but I think juggling keepers within the same competition is fucking stupid. Lloris had 4 consecutive games counting international duty and should have continued.

But really Chelsea have looked by a mile the best team in the league this season and we gave them a good game. I'm just very afraid of teams like City and Arsenal shredding our defense.

Del Bosque's squad is filled with Barca and Madrid players who - in spite of their differences - follow a somewhat similar, tiki-taka-ish style of football. The Spanish NT focus is on retaining possession for as long as possible and then hoping the opposition will evacuate space for someone to run on to - very much like Barca.

Mata insists on creating spaces and releasing 'krakens' almost as soon as he gets the ball.

I think the question of whether it is murder has to be considered under the legal realities of the time, and the concept of what an illegal war is. If an international body considers a war illegal but a country with engaged armed forces doesn't, then the soldiers cannot really be considered murderers as they are acting under the law of their own country. We could go all Godwin on this point quite easily, but that's my opinion.

true,bad-at-Reddit,null,null,"Because In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.

An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.

My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.

I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).

I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.

Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.

I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.

I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.

I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.

I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.

I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.

I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.

The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them.

I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit ""women are crazy"" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.

That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).

I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).

I uh also think Dempsey should be non-excludable from every squad in the world because he is American and it is his freedom. No coach can do that to him.

I am waiting for your replying.

I was explaining why you can't play Gylfi that deep (because he doesn't play there), also Falque played on the wings for us last year, as well as a more centered attacking midfielder.  Obviously, we lacked personnel today... so Dempsey had to start wider than we would like (making our left side play too narrow, unbalanced).  

By your logic, Livermore-Huddlestone would be a more balanced option than Sandro-Livermore (assuming a 4231).  Livermore cannot possibly be the blame for poor defensive play.  When you sit in the two of a 4231, you're probably going to have to play defense... I'm saying Huddlestone did OK, but he also made mistakes (just like the rest of the team).  I don't know if I even start Livermore over Hudd, but he's a different option.  Jake came in to an uphill struggle, its hard to judge the nature of a player's fit in a formation when the team is losing grip.  

RE: Livermore/Falque - I was merely comparing the merits of two youngsters based on their play styles (you can have a conservative winger and a flashy CDM).

This has got to be better than claiming electricity is more efficient, when the battery longevity and production is still an issue, not to mention the additional energy cost in creating electric vehicles in the first place to replace all those already manufactured petrol engines, and replace existing petrol stations with electric charging stations.

Dempsey is out of place, that much is obvious. He has one job to do and he doesn't even do that very well. 

Gylfi rarely gets passed to, but he still makes a good job with the balls he gets. He had a few great passes into the box and pretty good distribution to the center and out right to Lennon. Dempsey did, what, pass to Lennon every time he got the ball? 

I'll attribute Dempsey's terrible performance to jet lag and a long trip, which is entirely rational, but I think the starting spot is Gylfi's to lose. 

Dempsey didn't come back and play well on defense, while Gylfi was all over that left wing.

I know this is gonna be downvoted by the hive, that's the thing it's DESTROYING Reddit, but here it goes, Just about every time I see someone I stop. I kind of got out of the habit in the last couple of years, moved to a big city and all that, my girlfriend wasn't too stoked on the practice. Then some shit happened to me that changed me and I am back to offering rides habitually. If you would indulge me, it is long story and has almost nothing to do with hitch hiking other than happening on a road. This past year I have had 3 instances of car trouble. A blow out on a freeway, a bunch of blown fuses and an out of gas situation. All of them were while driving other people's cars which, for some reason, makes it worse on an emotional level. It makes it worse on a practical level as well, what with the fact that I carry things like a jack and extra fuses in my car, and know enough not to park, facing downhill, on a steep incline with less than a gallon of fuel. Anyway, each of these times this shit happened I was DISGUSTED with how people would not bother to help me. I spent hours on the side of the freeway waiting, watching roadside assistance vehicles blow past me, for AAA to show. The 4 gas stations I asked for a gas can at told me that they couldn't loan them out ""for my safety"" but I could buy a really shitty 1-gallon one with no cap for $15. It was enough, each time, to make you say shit like ""this country is going to hell in a handbasket."" But you know who came to my rescue all three times? Immigrants. Mexican immigrants. None of them spoke a lick of the language. But one of those dudes had a profound affect on me. He was the guy that stopped to help me with a blow out with his whole family of 6 in tow. I was on the side of the road for close to 4 hours. Big jeep, blown rear tire, had a spare but no jack. I had signs in the windows of the car, big signs that said NEED A JACK and offered money. No dice. Right as I am about to give up and just hitch out there a van pulls over and dude bounds out. He sizes the situation up and calls for his youngest daughter who speaks english. He conveys through her that he has a jack but it is too small for the Jeep so we will need to brace it. He produces a saw from the van and cuts a log out of a downed tree on the side of the road. We rolled it over, put his jack on top, and bam, in business. I start taking the wheel off and, if you can believe it, I broke his tire iron. It was one of those collapsible ones and I wasn't careful and I snapped the head I needed clean off. Fuck. No worries, he runs to the van, gives it to his wife and she is gone in a flash, down the road to buy a tire iron. She is back in 15 minutes, we finish the job with a little sweat and cussing (stupid log was starting to give), and I am a very happy man. We are both filthy and sweaty. The wife produces a large water jug for us to wash our hands in. I tried to put a 20 in the man's hand but he wouldn't take it so I instead gave it to his wife as quietly as I could. I thanked them up one side and down the other. I asked the little girl where they lived, thinking maybe I could send them a gift for being so awesome. She says they live in Mexico. They are here so mommy and daddy can pick peaches for the next few weeks. After that they are going to pick cherries then go back home. She asks if I have had lunch and when I told her no she gave me a tamale from their cooler, the best fucking tamale I have ever had. So, to clarify, a family that is undoubtedly poorer than you, me, and just about everyone else on that stretch of road, working on a seasonal basis where time is money, took an hour or two out of their day to help some strange dude on the side of the road when people in tow trucks were just passing me by. Wow... But we aren't done yet. I thank them again and walk back to my car and open the foil on the tamale cause I am starving at this point and what do I find inside? My fucking $20 bill! I whirl around and run up to the van and the guy rolls his window down. He sees the $20 in my hand and just shaking his head no like he won't take it. All I can think to say is ""Por Favor, Por Favor, Por Favor"" with my hands out. Dude just smiles, shakes his head and, with what looked like great concentration, tried his hardest to speak to me in English: ""Today you.... tomorrow me."" Rolled up his window, drove away, his daughter waving to me in the rear view. I sat in my car eating the best fucking tamale of all time and I just cried. Like a little girl. It has been a rough year and nothing has broke my way. This was so out of left field I just couldn't deal. In the 5 months since I have changed a couple of tires, given a few rides to gas stations and, once, went 50 miles out of my way to get a girl to an airport. I won't accept money. Every time I tell them the same thing when we are through: ""Today you.... tomorrow me."" tl;dr: long rambling story about how the kindness of strangers, particularly folks from south of the border, forced me to be more helpful on the road and in life in general.

true,tobbern,null,null,"Like a close friend of mine, I found Tate really annoying at first. Then, when assessing the power balance of their relationship, I realized why she had the best lines in conversation with the Doctor. She is not once, not ever, hopelessly in love with him. She has the best day of her life ruined by a bitchy alien spider queen and demands compensation from the Doctor. The hilarity of the situation allows for her, as a comedy actor, to slide perfectly into the world of Who. 

Following Rose and Martha who both loved the 10th, Donna appears as ""only a mate"" in the eyes of the Doctor, and she never lets down an opportunity to take the piss with him since there is after all one way she can interpret that as a pervert's slip of the tongue. He, the Doctor, is so lonely at this point that he puts up with it, and it makes for a comedic abusive friendship that gives him lots of laughs. Just what he needs. The horrible end where she loses everything and returns to her ordinary life is, in my opinion, the most cruel fate of all*. When she has to leave his life, you can see the beginning of the 10th losing the will to live, and the emergence of his desperate and tragic side. Because this is such powerful acting, this is the level that I and other fans will always hold Matt Smith up to as a bar of comparison. I dont know how the 11th will handle his most recent loss, but we expect it to cause a change in personality because that is how the show works.

* Dont get me wrong, Rose certainly deserves to be happy, but she gets her half-human Tennant to love even though she loses the original. Martha quits while she is still at it and comes out stronger from it, arguably the only companion IMO who comes out better both in absolute and relative terms. Amy and Rory both have each other in the end, even though they have a horribly messed up timeline and lose key experience raising their daughter. Donna however gets nothing. Her contributions to the universe are however immense. In terms of scale, I think she has made the greatest contribution, certainly as far as the universe is aware of it.

Suso was fairly peripheral, Sahin made some great runs but lacked end product (as did Suarez, but we're getting used to that). Sterling was damn impressive, though; lots of lovely crosses and cut-backs that should have been met with better finishes.

Gerrard had some lovely tackles and passes; he's looking more and more at ease in Rodgers' system. Wisdom fit right in again, and it was good to see Enrique come on and play well (and interesting to see Rodgers push Johnson into the front 3).

Honestly, at this point, Rodgers needs to have a word with Suarez. It was great to see the crowd supporting him the way they did, but if we develop a reputation of being a difficult place to referee then that won't be in our favour. I know he can't control the crowd, and he's missing out on some decisions he should get, but today he was sarcastically praising the ref when he finally did give him a decision, and that's unnecessary, as is the exaggerations when he falls.

This game really highlighted our inability to put the ball in the net. The entire game we were pushing and pushing against Reading's defense, but we couldn't get that final touch to get the goal. We should have at least three goals in this game. 

Also, our defense could have been a little better. We weren't terrible, but if we had been playing a better side today, we would have lost 3-1. Jones saved us in a couple situations, mainly in the second half. 

All in all, good win, but we still need to improve. Suarez needs to stay on his feet, Sterling needs to work on maintaining possession and becoming a better passer, Allen needs to work on making a few key passes, our defense needs to become a unit instead of four individual good players. 

We're on the right track. A striker would help immensely.

You can go through life not taking any risks and thus not making many mistakes but successful people will make mistakes, they will just make many more good moves.

Friedel doesn't come off his line when he needs to, so he doesn't miss a cross or drop a ball but at the same time he doesn't prevent the goals that he would have had he done so.

true,bad-at-Reddit,null,null,"Because In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.

An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.

My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.

I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).

I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.

Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.

I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.

I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.

I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.

I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.

I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.

I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.

The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them.

I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit ""women are crazy"" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.

That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).

I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).

I uh also think Dempsey should be non-excludable from every squad in the world because he is American and it is his freedom. No coach can do that to him.

I am waiting for your replying.

The costs of production, installation, and maintenance can be averaged out over the life of renewable generation methods in the same way as fossil fuel and nuclear plants.

The issues surrounding portability and peak generation of renewable energy are solved if you build a facility that outputs petrol rather than electricity, but at the cost of efficiency. This requires you to build more wind turbines or solar panels than if you used electricity directly. 

I raised the difference in efficiencies to explain why the costs quickly mount, such that renewable petrol doesn't have a cost advantage over mineral petrol, and we shouldn't expect our worries about fuel prices to disappear.

Whether electric cars are cheaper than petrol cars wasn't an issue I meant to approach. At present, they clearly aren't as convenient, and I think the cost of batteries means they're not actually any cheaper.

true,noiserr,null,null,"Dzeko is a big name in the Bosnian squad, there is no doubt about that. But this is exactly why everyone marks him. He actually gets less room when he plays for the Bosnian squad, then he does when he plays for City. Because City has bigger names. 

This is why your statement that every play and every shot when he plays for Bosnia is his, is simply not true. Also somehow I find it hard to believe that you would watch Bosnia's qualifying matches. With all the matches happening at the same time, why would you chose Bosnia to watch?

Anyways my point is simply that he doesn't suck as a starter. He may not be as effective as he is as a sub, but he just doesn't suck as a starter. Now keep him benched for a long time and he will get very little play time, which is very bad for a confidence striker like Dzeko.

Both organisations are run by individuals whose moral compass is fucked seventeen ways to Narnia. And said message generally appeals to a group of people who're already *somewhat* inclined to be receptive to these kinds of messages - seriously, go watch Yaxley-Lennon or Nick Griffin speak; Unless you're already somewhat pre-disposed to their cause, they're hardly going to win you over.

So assuming their message is peaceful in its delivery? They should be not only allowed to espouse it, but actively encouraged. I'd perfectly fine with Nick Griffin calling me a bullying fag in front of 10M Tv viewers?

Why? Because as already stated those already pre-disposed to follow the message[s] these organisations put out, would likely already think it anyway.

But more importantly, it exposes said organisations to the masses - and exposes the idiocracy of their arguments / positions / beliefs.

That's why I personally would love it if representatives from the EDL and BNP were regularly given air time. Because it'd rapidly expose their political positions for what they are - the ravings of mad men.

You put Yaxley-Lennon or Nick Griffin on Question Time every week, and, contrary to what some might suggest, they're not going to benefit from a massive boost in the polls.

The last article I read stated that the EDL have a membership - that's membership, not the number of people who go on their ""marches"" of, at maximum, 35,000. If every single one of those members was located in one constituency, and they **all** united behind one parliamentary candidate? That candidate would still likely not get elected.

Thirty five thousand members out of a population of what, around sixty three million? That amounts to approximately 0.055% of the population, based on my beer mat maths.

Even if you take the number of supporters the organisation themselves claim to have - 100,000 that still only amounts to 0.16% of the population.

9.91 million people watched *Strictly Come Dancing* this time last week. That's over 99x more people than even the EDL themselves claim will likely vote for them.

They have no elected members of any form of Government, local or national. They have no representatives on any elected council, body, or any political gathering, of any significance, in the country.

Whenever Yaxley-Lennon appears on TV he's routinely torn to shreds by even the least skilled reporters / interviewers. Kay Burley can dismantle the validity of his arguments FFS - Paxman? you could load him up with more illegal drugs than exist in the country, ply him with enough alcohol to keep Lindsey Lohan happy, and he could still point out all the glaringly obvious flaws in the EDLs political views.

Chief among them? The EDL claim to despise Islam, the Islamification of Society, and Al-Qaeda. This girl should be a fucking idol to them, given how she stood up to those who would choose to pervert Islam for their own ends.

&gt;Scratch beneath the surface of many government politicians and millions of voters you'll find agreement with EDL principals.

If that were true, as alluded to above, then the EDL / BNP and any similar organisation would have elected representatives in Government. Be it on local council bodies, local MPs or actually in the heart of Government.

They don't. The BNP ~~have~~ had two Euro MPs, one of whom resigned a few days ago, the other one who has been routinely savaged in even the right-leaning newspapers, for his little Twitter spat the other day.

I think you are wrong not to indulge in wilder conspiracy arguments. Even though they sound cuckoo, there is a ""knowing"" about them that is worthy of taking seriously (in an unserious way). I am rather fond of David Icke and think he's a genuine bloke who has communicated with some imaginal force and that his narrative, although I don't feel inclined to take it literally, is a fantastic poetic telling of the world we live in. 

The conspiracy view, even the fascistic versions of it, have truths in them that we shouldn't close our minds to if we are willing to step beyond the enforced consensus and liberate ourselves from the oppressive yoke of capitalism.

true,Bioluminescence,tardis,TARDIS,"Imagine rebooting an exceptionally long running series, and wanting to ensure that it can appeal to anyone - not just the 'well educated', middle class, nerdy loners that it was being held in the hearts of during its hiatus.

To appeal to the more pseudo-intellectuals, they have The Doctor - the intellectuals intellectual.  Barmy, brilliant, lonesome and wise - he is everything a young nerd wants to grow into.  

But what about the other portion of the audience?  The portion that has never really gotten into sci-fi (because its for nerds) and hates all that Star Wars stuff with Captain Kirk?  Who do they have to empathize with?  Sure - you could have Madame du Pompadour being witty and upper class and foreign and exciting - but you've already covered those qualities with The Doctor.

Instead, there's an 'everyman' - someone who's so common, so everyday, so generally utterly ignorable, un-heroic and unworthy - that they have little to dream of, nor any reason to do so.  Decades of their life looms before them - working a retail job, going to Majorca on their hols, getting drunk every Friday and watching reality TV every night.

How amazing, then, to show that even the people that (honestly) we look down on so often, the people who believe they have so little to look forwards to and who think they can make nothing of themselves, that it is within them to become heroes themselves.  They can be brave - they can do the right thing when everyone else is ready to do the wrong one - they can protect the weak and the oppressed and they can save the bloody world.

When he tries to reach that level of fright with his adult sensibilities, he ends up with something that goes way farther.

And yeah, like the other replies say, the gradual increase in horror happened alongside an increase in viewers, so they decided they could push things farther than they originally thought they could.

Then Gerrard kicked into gear but Allen faded away. is there a way for them both to get going at the same time, or would they need to be spread out more? Happy for Sterling, may he score many more. Liked Enrique when he came on, played with energy  and creativity. 

loved the possession game we were playing first half. the defense looked strong, we were winning back a lot of balls at midfield. I wish they hadn't gone to a more desperate play style, liverpool were still getting chances in the first half after the first ten minutes or so, with out giving up the counterattacks. 

next two games against Anzi and Everton have me nervous/ excited. we shall see.

true,Tailend22,cnty-england,Berkshire!,"Yes, drone strikes are an alternative. 

Put simply - The PAF, the Pakistani Air Force, are certainly not the best trained of pilots. They don't have the best equipment. Hell, until 2009 they were using Google Earth for recon information on the Swat Valley, leading up to the offensive. They had to beg to the US for IR equipment that could map the area effectively.

Now then:

The PAF, prior to US involvement, were using dumb (unguided) bombs launched from Soviet and Chinese jets. Dumb munitions have several key downsides.

- Inaccurate. The method of launching is to let loose, and hope it hits the target.

- Able to be dropped into something like a compound, due to the nature of the trajectory.

- Increased chance of the munition not going off, meaning a child etc could stumble upon it and set it off.

- Reduced ability to stay onstation, due to a jet's high fuel consumption.

Guided munitions, such as a hellfire missile fired from a drone, allow for several things.

- The ability to guide in the missile to the exact position you want

- The ability to stay on station after firing the missile(combined with a drone's massively increased flight times due to lessened fuel consumption etc.). This means that the people on the ground are able to confirm exactly what the missile hit, what the damage is, how many deaths occurred etc. All of this information, the guncam footage and so on, will be stored. This ensures that whatever happens, after a certain period of time it will all have to be released to the public, allowing for a certain level of transparency.

- From the moment you get eyes on the target to the moment the missile strikes it (and beyond that), you will have a camera trained on the position.

Furthermore, the addition of the US or UK ensures we have another element in the mix, as well - Coverage. If the struggle against the Taliban/Al-Qaeda in the Swat valley and surrounding areas was to be dealt with by Pakistan on its own, you can guarantee that the issue would receive nowhere near the attention it does now. Indeed, the level of information/articles on strikes before US involvement is disappointingly scarce. This means US/UK forces are subject to an extra level of scrutiny, which *does* improve the situation. The US have improved the standards by which they operate thanks to this close scrutiny, both in Pakistan and in Afghanistan as well.

**In conclusion:**

Yes, the Drone strikes are certainly the lesser of two evils. They have the consent of Pakistan, they result in a lower level of casualties, and they ensure documentation. The thought of what might be going on had the US not been involved to me is horrifying.

I am proud to live in a country which will offer these services to someone who stands up for what she beleives in and is an example to others, whatever colour her skin is, whatever religion she follows and wherever she was born.

However, I am ashamed to be the same nationality as these cruel and heartless people who would refuse life saving medical treatment to a child because of where she was born, or which religion she follows, or the colour of her skin.

It's *really* fucking complicated. I've been involved in energy research and energy policy for a just under a decade and I've barely scratched the surface. 

Just making our electricity clean would be a *staggering achievement* let alone supplying our transport and heating requirements. You're talking several hundred GW of clean electricity, you'd need a nuclear power station every 40km around the whole of the UK. You can forget about renewables, we don't have the land area. We could just about do it if we were prepared to transport the electricity from thousands of miles away, but the engineering and geopolitics around this are likely to be prohibitive.  

I'm no Tory lover, but it won't happen under any government. Humanity is just not ready for that level of sacrifice, and even if we were, it would take decades to get assemble the expertise and gear up manufacturing. 

The public's lack of understanding around energy is mind blowing.

The Doctor takes them out of their own element and into unfamiliar worlds and eras. I feel like Rose and Martha filled the pupil role fairly well in learning as they go, starting off in shades of wide-eyed wonder and amazement, but slowly becoming fairly confident by the end (Rose's speech to the Sycorax leader was a funny take on how confident she'd become while still knowing so little). Amy and Rory are ok with it, but tend to blend into the scenery a bit too much for my liking. With Donna it was just non-stop loud, bitchy, &amp; obnoxious without bringing much else to the table. Comedy's great and all, but the show's strength is in narrative not comedy.

Thoughts? I'd be interested in rewatching her episodes to see if I might revise my opinion, but I just don't think I can bring myself to do it.

She's still better than River, though. Any day.

Uther knew of times when merlin saved Arther and the realm.

He pardoned Gaius and he became the court healer so he has the power to accept magic users to some degree.

true,dragonfire882,tardis,TARDIS,"So far, this season is good, not great. In general, I'm finding Moffat is a fantastic episodic writer, but he isn't consistent with running a series. When Davies was running the show, every single thing made sense and ended up having a connection somehow. Moffat relies too heavily on shock value, gimmick, and ""oh why not, just because."" So far, this season's episodes had the potential to be better than what they were. The seeds of greatness were there, but were not fully realized. For example, the opening episode involved the Doctor having to *save* the Daleks; knowing the Doctor's history with the Daleks, that kind of premise carries a great moral dilemma. There was an opportunity to deepen the Doctor's character and it was pushed aside for the sake of playing up the drama between Rory and Amy, which was so contrived and unnecessary. I guess it was supposed to make their love and dedication in ""The Angels Take Manhattan"" feel more impactful, but it didn't for me. 

Likewise, this episode had the potential to be great, but it wasn't handled well. I think it would've been a great season opener or a season finale, not a mid-season finale. Amy and Rory forged such a special bond with the Doctor, the stakes should've been higher. The Doctor can't see them again - tragic, but so what? It's been done before. The angels are awesome enemies, but they're really a one-trick pony. Moffat always seems to bring them back when he needs a guaranteed thrill. Oh, and River shows up, again, how convenient. I realize her and the Doctor are intertwined and that's part of her mystique, but she needed more of a reason for being there other than being River. Overall, it wasn't an awful episode, but it could've been better. It was more of what's already been done, just in a slightly altered package. With all that said, I am glad Amy and Rory had long lives together. I only wish the show had told us more about how they lived.

Our deficit went from Â£36bn in 2007 to Â£156bn in 2009. It's since gone down to Â£121bn in 2011 but it's still ridiculously higher than it should be. 

The fact that we were in a deficit even in the boom years shows just how misguided Labours spending was. It simply can not be retained, and that's why we now have the Tories sorting everything out again and being the bad guys.

I'm only familiar with the reboot, so I'm a ""newer"" fan (not oldschool). I actually saw the episode ""Blink"" first (right when it came out) and was blown away by it, so then went back and started watching from the beginning of the reboot.

Personally, I like Ten best, though Eleven is pretty awesome, too. I love Captain Jack and Donna.

As for favorite episodes, ""Human Nature""/""Family of Blood"" is definitely up there. Of course ""Blink,"" as well. ""The God Complex"" has stuck with me quite a bit, musing about what my room would be.

* **[2006 FA cup final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsApNfJ06eI&amp;feature=related)**

* **[2012 Carling Cup Final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng_rwREnAw0)**

**The Manager:**

* [Brendan Rodgers or 'BR':](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Rodgers)
Our current Manager is in his first season in charge of LFC. He is a very tactical manager and a creative manager, know for his use of the ['Tiki-Taka'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiki-taka) style of play (Lots of quick short passing, with the main intention of keeping high possession)  

**Important Key Players:**

* [**(C)Steven Gerrard**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gerrard): Steven was born and raised in Liverpool and brought into the first team through the youth academy. He is both Captain of LFC and England, he is also highly regarded as one of the best Midfielders in the world and one of the best ever English players. He is a Midfielder, who can play on the right wing and also as an attacking midfielder, he is famous for his loyalty to LFC, his never say die attitude, his very impressive  passing/crossing/vision and thunderous shooting power. 

 **He is widely accepted as LFC best all time player, no words or videos can truly justify his brilliance** [Goals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D9RRML2As) 

* **[Luis Suarez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su%C3%A1rez)**: Luis is a Uruguayan Forward/Left Attacking winger who came to LFC in 2011. He is the former Captain of Ajax and is the current Captain of Uruguay. In his short time here he has established himself as one of the most creative players not only in the prem or Europe but the world. Near Impossible for defenders to stop this man has single handedly engaged and beaten some of the best [defences/defenders in the world.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM4O4Da4sDI) Famous for his [nutmegs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEtC-QOfWWQ) (taking the ball through a players legs) he's one of the few players in the world that can both set up themselves and others while facing overwhelming oppositional pressure aswell as well as being able to [score some incredible goals.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gffOsZCMCoI&amp;feature=related) 

 **He is currently our most valuable player.** 

* **[Pepe Reina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Reina):** Pepe is a Spanish Goal keeper. Having been here since 2005, he is one of our most senior players and is 3rd captain (behind Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher). Reina is one of the best keepers in the premier league making him one of the best keepers in the world, having won the Premier leagues golden gloves (best keeper award/ most clean sheets) a record **[3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League_Golden_Glove)** times. Its widely believed he would be held higher up the world ranking list (where he's currently 7th) if he was Spain's number 1 keeper choice, unfortunately the worlds Number 1 currently holds that position. Known for his [super man saves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFa8oZQwaLE&amp;feature=related) and his outstanding penalty saving record few, this man has saved us more times than he has been given credit for. 

 **He is currently our number 1 choice goal keeper and arguably one of our, if not the best goal keeper we've ever had.**

----------------------------

**Important Players:**

* **[Martin Skrtel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_%C5%A0krtel)/[Daniel Agger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Agger)**: Referred to as ['The Great Wall of Anfield'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRKUTQc5bic) Skrtel and Agger (captain of the Danish National Team) make up our central defence. Last season they were statistically the most efficient central defenders in the league (this of course led to offers for them both ranging between 20-25 million EACH which were rejected) the 6 foot plus brick walls could be argued as perhaps our best ever back 2 [because not much passes them on their watch.](http://www3.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Martin+Skrtel+Daniel+Agger+Liverpool+v+Fiorentina+3rys-L5nGlqx.jpg) They also from time to time score making them multi useful players.

 **Known also for: [Both have sleeve tattoos and look scary as fuck](http://www.sabotagetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/Agger-and-Skrtel.jpg)**

* **[Glen Johnson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Johnson_(English_footballer)/[Jose Enrique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Enrique_S%C3%A1nchez):** Jose is a Left Full back and Glen is a Right Full back (play on the side of the central defenders). Glen may be a full back but is an Attacking full back which means he get much higher up the pitch then you'd expect other defenders to get, he's also racked up a number of goals! As of lately, BR has been playing Glen on the left in Jose position and seems to be looking at putting Enrique on the left wing in midfield but this may not last.

 **Known also for: [Glen: Englands strongest Right FB and his attacking](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFgJa4jHG08&amp;feature=related), Jose: Is the current [Celebrity FIFA 13 champion](http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/c27.0.403.403/p403x403/543206_434512316584237_1057578081_n.jpg)**

* **[Lucas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Leiva):** Lucas is a Defensive midfielder from Brazil. Tipped to be the next LFC captain, this player in the early stages of his LFC career came under criticism about his ability and first team suitability but he fought back and has since become one of the strongest, most consistent high level performing players in the current LFC squad.  

 **Known for: [His vision, high work rate, passing and tackling](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebGxngMOZI4)**

* **[Nuri Sahin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuri_%C5%9Eahin)**: Nuri is a Turkish Midfielder currently here on loan from Real Madrid where he is a 3rd/4th choice sub. In only 5 appearances he has managed to score an impressive 3 goals and provide 4 assists, with many Liverpool fans calling for him to be made a permanent member of the LFC squad. 

 **Known for:** His great vision and passing abilities, if a player has an inch of space Nuri is capable of getting it to them, known for splitting defences in half. [Compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcFDZBEe19M)

* **(cC)[Jamie Carragher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher):** Born and raised in Liverpool and like Gerrard came into the first team through the academy, recently celebrated his **700th** appearance and is currently the co-captain. One of best all time defenders and tacklers LFC has ever seen, Jamie is not only the heart, but one of the most fearless leaders in LFC history. Jamie is currently slowly being phased out of the first team, soon he'll retire and take up coaching but this man will forever be the heart of this team. (I apologise for putting him so far down the list but as your a new fan you honestly wont be seeing much of him in the future)

 **Also Known For:** [Having the strongest scouse accent in history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDaTTVR2JXY&amp;feature=related)

-----------------------------------------

**New/Up and coming Players:**

* **[Jonjo Shelvey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonjo_Shelvey):** Only 20 years old but is already tipped to take the reigns from Gerrard, hard working and always driving forward with a powerful shot and tackle, BR is already trying to work him into the first team. [Widely expected to be a future star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRUrHTOkr1c).

* **[Raheem Sterling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raheem_Sterling):** The wonder boy may only be 17 years old but this season he's established himself as regular first team player. Since a young teenager he has been labelled as a great prospect for the future and this year he's really shown why, taking his current position away from an England regular that cost the club more than 20 million. Scored his first league goal, TODAY! He has a perfect sync of speed, agility and balance and has become a nightmare for defenders with his endless supply of energy and dribbling. He is perhaps the best player to come through the academy since Gerrard. [Compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_AojzNeEg0)

* **[Jordan Henderson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Henderson):** Only 22 and is the current U21 England Captain. Suffered a bit in his first season with LFC but has since visibly grown as a player and has grown and developed into a much more well rounded player. Known for his quick precise passing and movement, BR's style of play is ideally suited to Henderson who some claim to be [underrated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Henderson). 

* **[Joe Allen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Allen_(footballer_born_1990):** 22 year old Welshmen was brought to the club by BR and has immediately made a name for himself for his incredibly high pass completion rate and great vision.

* **[SebastiÃ¡n Coates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebasti%C3%A1n_Coates):** 22 year old Uruguayan, is already a fan favourite and his first team career is just starting. In his LFC debut, Coates [scored a goal of the season contender](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rlEg_GOyiA) and since been consistently impressive at the back with his perfectly timed tackles, solid in the air, breaking down of attacks, but also his equally impressive headers while attacking has brought him praise. Expected to be a regular in the first team soon and some fans are already saying he could be on his way to becoming one of our best ever defenders.

* **[Oussama Assaidi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oussama_Assaidi):** 24, Moroccan player bought by BR for Â£4 million, he was a shock buy as very few fans had heard of him and has only played in a few games but has been VERY impressive with his work rate, his crossing and his ability to pass through defenders. Most fans agree at 4 mil, he's looking like a steal. 

* **[Andre Wisdom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Wisdom):** 19 years old and a surprise to many. A lot of fans were asking questions when BR placed Wisdom a virtually unknown Academy player in at right back during a Europa league game (European tournament) but impressively Wisdom held his own and broke down attack after attack and help to keep the ball in the other half of the pitch by pressing forward well. Even more impressively was when he came out of nowhere and [scored a brilliant header in his debut](http://www.bing.com/videos/watch/video/liverpool-takes-the-lead-with-a-wisdom-header/12an1s5l?cc=in&amp;cpkey=90674bd8-ddc1-4a40-b7e8-4c13c4ee2296%7C%7C%7C%7C) since then Wisdom has started to feature more and more into the first team and at his current rate looks to be set in staying there.

* **Suso**: at just 18, Suso is another player to come through the youth academy at LFC as a hot prospect for the future. He recently signed a new contract with the club, the young Spaniard turned down offers from Barcelona and Real Madrid (2 of the best teams in the world today) to come to Liverpool. Known for his left foot, great turn of pace, vision and passing, Suso has been tipped to become LFC's home grown version of [Xabi Alonso](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso) (Former LFC player, regarded as a LFC legend and is one of the best passing players in the world/all time)

An update to it: Brendan Rodgers is the new manager of Liverpool. He's a young manager who has a philosophy of fluid football that allows us to keep the ball. He's had a difficult start with injuries, but he's the first manager we've had in a while who trusts in the youth at the club, and a lot of us would say that it's been working for him.


We currently have two legends playing for the team - Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard. Carragher is a central defender who is in the end of his career. Though he is now declining in ability because he is 34, he still has a fantastic mind for the game. He has played the most games in all competitions of any Liverpool player save Ian Callaghan.

Many would argue that Steven Gerrard is one of the best midfielders to play the game. He is currently the captain of Liverpool and the English national team. He has inspired numerous improbable feats, most notably the 2005 Champions League Final win, in which Liverpool came back from 3-0.

The club is currently in a rebuilding stage after some disastrous financial managing by our previous owners. We've hit speed bumps along the way, and our current position is not pretty, but the way the team is being built now gives us much hope for the future. Liverpool currently have the youngest squad in the Barclay's Premier League.

A little about myself: I started watching football during the 2006 World Cup, but only caught an occasional game until the late part of the 07-08 season, when Liverpool started growing on me. I became a fan in 08-09, which was the best Liverpool season in the league since 01-02. I've followed the team ever since.

[Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx8tMiaNawI) a great goal by John Arne Riise against Man Utd.

Liverpool vs Newcastle in 1996 is often regarded as the best premiership game ever. [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4ezBOXQYkI) is the winning goal. 

Liverpool were almost eliminated in the early stages of the Champions League in 2005.

true,pieandkimche,null,null,"I mean the one which was negotiated in 76 and issued in 77 before the winter of discontent in 78-79 and Thatchers election in 79.

Forgive me for being naive but whilst providing a safety net, the IMF does not just lend money out willy nilly for no benefit of its own.

Two years is an incredibly short period of time in debt terms and knowing that the UK could instantly devalue itself out of its obligations, it would be naive to believe that there was no conditionality attached to any loan. 

Even if the loan is repaid 5 minutes after being borrowed, conditionality still applies as part of the T&amp;C's and looking at the state of the UK between 77-79, please correct me if I am mistaken, but I don't think any structural reform or expenditure cuts were successfully implemented. Infact, quite the opposite was true.

Also, another factor worth considering... after watching the Unions wilfully and gleefully cannibalise their own political wing, the Labour Party, for selfish short term gain, WHY WOULDN'T Thatcher go to war with them. They were a direct threat to the democratic process in Britain. Remember this radical Union action came against a Cold War backdrop as the US even went so far to boycott the Moscow Olympics in 1980.

TL:DR I think a lot of younger protestors dont get this but much of what they claim to despise and oppose is the direct consequence of the selfish behaviour of their ringmasters. The behaviour of the Thatcher Government was both a direct and indirect consequence of Union behaviour... direct in IMF conditionality, indirect in political necessity.

Whilst not a tory buff myself, and despite any indications my post may give, I fully understand why the Thatcher is hated and loved equally. By some she is seen as evil for having smashed the left in the UK, by others she saved democracy.

When they move and hense when they are not being observed they are not supposed to be stone statues. We don't know what they are then but that was always part of the mystery. What really killed it was when they just butchered the whole reason blinking was a bad thing (ie being a long enough time for them to get you) to being some integral part of how they actually get you. Amy blinks at the angel while it is still clearly being observed by the Doctor and River and it doesn't move but somehow sends amy back in time without touching her. Originally It was never the actual blinking that let them get you but the incredible speed of them when not being observed. Also river gets physically touched by one and it doesn't send her back at all because she didn't blink. Its like there is now a difference between the lights going out and blinking. One act makes them move, the other gives them time travelling attack. In blink these where all one in the same. It was a part of their physiology that they cannot help but turn to stone when being observed. It was simple. That's what made them terrifying.now they have all these rules like they remain stone if you walk like you can see and they can send you back in time if you blink even if being observed.

I completely agree with you. Especially since the Doctor makes a point of trying to make everyone feel special and important. He sees value in people that goes beyond the superficial and helps that person bring it out in themselves. 

Rose's lack of ambition stems from her mother, who instead of encouraging her daughter to go back to school tells her that she has to go out and get a job right after the explosion because *she* doesn't want to support her. She's merely a product of her situation, in a sense. 

Rose's character was crucial for the Doctor as she helped him through the anger and guilt he felt over the Time War. She gave him unconditional love and friendship at a time when he was vulnerable and help to humanize him. She helped to show him that what he was doing was wrong, like most companions.

 Another thing, an ""investment bank"" will struggle to survive if it's not connected to a high street savings bank, if people dont save any money in the bank they have very little money to work with, and if banks can't trade loans anymore either they are not going to be able to get the money needed to invest in the first place, so they don't give out loans, don't make profit, and don't survive.
  The only plausible solution is if you have two types of bank, one for safe savings, with no interest at all, and no loans, so basically a safety deposit box, and high interest trading banks, however if this occurred people will again decide to put their money in bonds with decent yields and high security, or foerign less regulated banks. Meaning both ""types"" of banks will shrink and die out, while our entire financial sector dies, mass unemployment, no money = Greece.

You are correct that there are billions of unpaid taxes from corps which would help out, but I suspect not as much as we all would like to believe.

My view is that by attending this circus ringmaster protests lead by Labour and the Unions, folk are falling into a collective Stockholm Syndrome type daydream listening to the guys who previously almost destroyed British democracy for personal gain in the 70s and others who went to town with financial deregulation, leading to much of Wall Streets dirty work of the past decade being done in London offices with disastrous results.

The Tories are pricks, all three partys are same same wankers, but in my humble opinion they are not as dangerous as these guys organising these marches. 

I have been lucky to have spent equal time in both Spain, the UK and Korea this year, so its quite interesting to see the complete contrast in approaches and results... obviously you cant make definitive comparisons but you have one union dominated nation in free fall with rampant unemployment, a left/right stalemate with close of 0% growth and a low tax, corporate dominated, socially protectionist nation who is pissed off with 2-4% growth.

The Doctor has always been male, and has always loved female companions.

There's so much to adjust he becomes female. If the Doctor becomes female, then they would have to take on a male companion as a main, to retain balance and make sure the regular audience isn't alienated. But this wouldn't make sense with the Doctor's core personality. Maybe you could pull off a male *and* female companion, but then that's repeating Amy and Rory. 

And of course there's my personal fear that the Doctor will suddenly become sexual, much like River is, because that is what Television does to female characters. I want the Doctor to remain brotherly and protective, and I know a proper female actor can do that but only with a proper and ready crew, which I don't think can happen right now.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"&gt;but you can't change too much or it is no longer what people loved

I wholly disagree here. Doctor Who is the show that is all about change. It's barely recognizable as the show it started out to be in the 60s. The only thing that's stayed the same is the TARDIS and technically...that has changed too. Nobody said the Doctor has always loved female companions. He's flirted with males (like Jack) and I'm pretty sure he had a relationship with a guy named Fitz in EU.

There's so much to adjust if he becomes female? No... you just switch the companion's gender too. Which isn't really a requirement either considering the Doctor has had male companions before. You're acting like it's the Doctor's core personality to keep around female companions because he likes girls. Which is wholly wrong. He was considered asexual all the way up to 1989. Now he's considered bisexual...or maybe pan considering he flirted with a tree.

The gender of the Doctor would not change much of anything. We all have a personal fear that the Doctor would become sexual if he changed genders but then we all have a personal fear that the next Doctor won't be as good as the previous.

&gt;I know a proper female actor can do that but only with a proper and ready crew, which I don't think can happen now

This attitude...it's not good. You're saying that you don't trust the current ""crew"" to handle a gender swap properly. What crew is this? You're saying that a female actor could only pull it off if she had help from a ""crew"".

You can be afraid that a gender bend would ruin the show, but to say you wouldn't even watch it on the *possibility* that they screw it up...well.

I think your idea of what females are like/supposed to be are just a little bit more rigid than mine...But like I said in the above post, when it comes to the Doctor, all bets are off. Change body and personality, but same person. But change gender and suddenly it wouldn't be the same? I disagree. I think your gender roles are showing.

Seriously. Besides being overly sexualized (and the Doctor *has* gotten more sexual over the years) and changing the companion's gender (not required) what would -maybe- change?",0,1350784484,null,0,1350785091,0,c6phrnd,t3_11t9jf,t1_c6phrnd,t1_c6phnid,null,1430200269,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2
true,ShinInuko,tennant,Tennant,"I'm kinda seeing this PTSD style character development that I'm really enjoying. 9 was just back from the war, so he was bitter and a quite viscious. During 10, the Doctor seemed to be trying to put it all behind him, trying to be a good man again, although he's got his moments where he snaps. However, in 11, he's starting to realize the psychological and emotional wounds he's suffered from his double-genocide will never heal, and he's starts to succumb to the bitterness and rage whenever his friends aren't there to help him maintain his humanity. He no longer has any kind of illusions about being a good man again, and every adventure just seems like a struggle between solving things the quick and easy (violent) way, or doing things the hard, non-violent way. I mean, come on, in A Town Called Mercy, the Doctor of all people was seconds away from putting a bullet in the guy's face, as opposed to 10, who was so damn pacifistic that he still abhorred guns even when he was John Smith.

Of course, we can't forget A Good Man Goes To War, where the Doctor blew up half the fleet of Cybermen. 11 is a portrayal of the Hero becoming the Anti-hero, the antithesis of the evolution from 9-10 going anti- to true-hero.

His plan was done a bit and worked, too; economic growth was at 1.2% when the Coalition came in to power in the second quarter of 2010. At that rate it would've cleared 2% and would've given us ample room for austerity to balance the budget without throwing us back in to recession - unfortunately, Osborne's plan cut right from the off and has declined the economy since.",0,1350788626,null,0,false,0,c6pimru,t3_11snbh,t1_c6pimru,t3_11snbh,null,1430200687,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

But, contrary to what some commenting say, series 1 does not start of slowly, I instantly was taken in by the cheesyness, actually, and random silly scenes. Such as The Doctor shouting at a tabloid ""Well, *that's* not going to work, because *he's gay* and *she's an alien*!"" Or Mickey being awkward because [spoiler](#s ""he got turned plastic."").

 It's mostly the adventures and struggles Merlin and Arthur goes through that makes this such a good show. Plus, Merlin will now be a servant and a nanny too?

No mention of financial deregulation in my post above but I take your point. Also I was summarising about some of the typical action the IMF approach.

In the UK's case, the IMF episode had the effect of starting the ball rolling towards a further clash between Gov and Unions over how to run Britain. In the end things got to the point where a militant Union presence could not be tolerated in British Industry anymore and privatisation became the de facto solution.

From that initial clash, over her terms in office the policy became more mainstream leading to the evil Tory stereotype which is not necessarily untrue.

My default point on any of these issues is that without accepting the Unions and Labour's key role in moulding policies of the Thatcher years, criticising Tory's from Union/Labour view point is a pointless exercise. Going on marches organised by the same organisations who moulded the culture they are protesting seems like a pretty futile exercise in my opinion.

A bit like going on a Mayonnaise diet

be. Also, with him, I think we could finish in the top four putting us into champions league for next season. I great a lot of respect for him as a person more then as a player the second he went to Athletico Madrid over going to other clubs for money after his great season at Porto. I think if he chose to come to Liverpool it could be a smart move on his part as well. It would give him at least a season where he could get used to English football before we possibly got into champions league where he would really work his magic. 

On top of everything else, we are a few players away from really thriving and getting even closer to the success I think our team is capable of. If he came to us, I don't think we would need to buy another player in January to be successful this season. 

Personally, I would ask the owners to give Falcao whatever he wants in January.

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying they flat out shouldn't, but it's something that would be a bit of a gamble: they would likely lose fans, probably pick up some more among the female demographic, the companion would likely be different in one way or another.

I noticed a lot of people keep saying ""the Doctor isn't sexual"", and that fears of a female Doctor becoming sexual are unbiased, but let's take a look at the New Who companions:

Rose: not necessarily sexual, but in love with the Doctor.
Martha: same as Rose.
Donna: a break from the norm, neither sexual nor in love with the Doctor.
Amy: became more sexualized, attracted to the Doctor in some episodes.
River: I think this is where a lot of people's fears stem from. She began as this mysterious future companion, and turned into a hyper-sexualized companion. Don't get me wrong, I love River, but I think people are afraid this is what a female Doctor would turn in to.

I, personally, think that's where the appeal of her character lies. She's *human*. She's very human, flawed, and vulnerable. Yes, I hated how she treated Mickey. And how she fawned over the Doctor. Guess what, she's 19. People forget that. She's a kid. 

And before people start saying ""well *I'm* that age too and it's unfair to judge someone by age*"". I'm 20 (and a girl), so I think I can speak from the age aspect. And you can't really ignore that aspect. She is young and acts like a teenager. Because she is one. Also, she fell in love with the Doctor.

People complain that she's selfish because she acts like she's so important and get jealous when she sees the Doctor with other companions. You can't help who you fall in love with. And for Rose, it was the Doctor. Of course she's going to be upset when she realizes she can never be with him (well, up until the episode where she gets the meta-crisis Doctor). 

TL;DR - She's human, flawed, and is practically a kid. That's why I find her appealing as a companion because I find her realistic and relatable.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I completely agree. Tennant, and even Eccleston had a certain zest, excitement, one that I can only compare to Tom Baker era, whereas the Moffat variations seem very kid-oriented, stories that seem to be the same, with miniscule changes and alterations. Amy and Rory are not my favorite and the show does seem to meander. Even episodes I enjoyed to an extent, such as the return of the Silurians, were only good to a point. By the time they come close to a conclusion, they turn into overly sappy, uninteresting, ""all about the kids"" show. 

In many ways, the Sarah Jane show had more adult and serious problems to contend with than the most recent incarnation of the Doctor.

There seems to be no really cool new creatures, no appreciation for alien life-forms, and the attachment to Amy and Rory has transcended any relationship that the Doctor had with any of his companions thus far. 

The Doctor previously had companions that were from different backgrounds, different eras, even aliens, thus making them an interesting lens for a change in perspective. Amy and Rory are just the same old, or perhaps more accurately, a hyper-hipster version of Rose and Martha. Amy is a supermodel couched in youth-appeal with no regard for the history, relevance or reality of what it means to be a companion.

I am still reeling from the ridiculous notion of how Song was born - just Amy and Rory having sex on Tardis - apparently this makes River Song a half-timelord. But if this were the case, a) Rose would have acquired some major super-powers because if I'm not mistaken, she literally served as Tardis vessel; and b) the Doctor, desperate for a timelord, being the last of his kind, would have propagated an entire race of half-Timelords by simply being romantically involved in a Tardis. 

In other words, Moffat chose to ignore a great deal of Doctor Who history in order to create this more inane, and in my opinion, less interesting version of the Doctor. 

Most importantly, the excitement for all things living, earthly as well as alien, that were so wonderfully embodied in Tom Baker, Eccleston, and Tennant, are simply absent from Smith's/Moffat variant.

also. It is supposed to go like this in order of most mature to least: Torchwood being most mature, Doctor Who being the middle ground, and Sarah Jane as most ""kiddish"". not Torchwood, Sarah Jane, Doctor Who. So I am right there with you on that one.

You could argue that despite the cost, they're still travelling in first class whereas many of their constituents don't get that luxury from their own employers. I worked for a very affluent multinational and even if I could prove the standard class ticket was more expensive, they won't reimburse for first class travel.

It must be a source of embarrassment because even the great leader, Ed Miliband, feels the need to rip the antimacassars off the seats just in case any cameras snap him in first class. http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/04/14/article-1377051-0BA1CB4700000578-925_468x286.jpg

As for whether MPs get first class travel I think it should depend on what everyone else gets. How many employers willingly pay for first class travel (and especially even where it's cheaper than standard)? It's not like MPs are on a pittance of a wage.

true,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"I can give some answers here:

First thing that should not have been cut was the 50 rate of tax. It was raising money, they admitted it raised at least Â£200million when they cut it as they replaced it with other taxes. If they had kept it and kept until they had a good idea of what effect it had (bearing in mind they didn't even have a full years worth of figures on it when it was cut), and cracked down on tax avoidance then it could have raised a lot more.

Secondly they shouldn't have spent billions re-organising the NHS to bring in more private sector involvement. Even if it would improve the NHS (it wouldn't) and it was popular and the government had a mandate to do it (it isn't and the government promised no top down re-organisation of the NHS) then it cost money in the short term rather than saving money, which was the governments justification.

Thirdly no one wants or needs this internet snooping plan, cut that and save billions. 

Fourthly raising tuition fees saved no money in the short term, the government just went from paying for tuition up front to loaning it to students to pay for it. In the long term the government will get more money back but by that point hopefully we won't have a large deficit.

Fifthly they can't cut any more form the welfare budget. Reducing housing benefit saved billions and did make sense. Cutting it entirely for under 25s does not make sense. Paying Atos, a private company, to go through and deny people access to disability benefits and ESA also does not make sense. People who are genuinely disabled are losing out, while Atos are making a profit from taxpayers money.

Sixthly introduce a mansion tax, raise corporation tax back up to 30% (it was 28% but has been cut to 24%), and make capital gains tax progressive rather than a flat rate of 18% to discourage people using it to avoid tax. 

Then employ more tax collectors, as each tax collector employed actually raises more money than they cost to employ. So far the government has sacked 3,300 tax collectors, the treasury accounts committee estimates this has actually cost them Â£1.1 billion in lost tax revenue. Their should be a real clamp down on tax avoidance (the governments clamp down will have no effect) - 30-70 billion is lost to avoidance and evasion each year, depending on whose estimate you believe, and actually collecting this tax would take a huge chunk out of the deficit.

Finally yes some departments would still need to make cuts but smaller ones, which hopefully could be achieved by increasing efficiency as yes it probably is true that not everything in the public sector is run as efficiently as it could be.",0,1350814864,null,0,false,0,c6pmfb6,t3_11snbh,t1_c6pmfb6,t1_c6pg5fw,null,1430202464,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

* Â£125k = 0.22%
* Â£175k = 0.56%
* Â£250k = 0.92%

It was gash-y all the way up to the ceremony (Which was awesome). I have nothing wrong with the Olympics themselves and its great seeing all countries under one roof and NO guns.

Just the stigma that went with it killed it completely for me as an individual. Not wearing branded Ts with the wrong logo, big corporations sponsoring that aren't in anyway doing 'great for the country, let alone the world'. I mean having the biggest McDonalds in London. Yeah great... Fat kids.

Also, I'm not sure how educated the r/UK are with how very 'British' this Olympics was. Apart from the opening ceremony, not a lot of it was very British at all. I mean where do I begin; the logo was created by a British Graphic Design Agency who is an umbrella of an American group. The park/stadium designed by an american. Most of the sponsorship, not British. The Shopping centre and athlete flats are partly, if not mostly owned by the Qatari's (Along with the chelsea barracks, the shard, harrods,  27% stake in Songbird Estates, the majority owner of Canary Wharf. And as above owning the Olympic Village!)

Worth the TAX PAYERS money - No
Very British - No
Help us recover from economic turmoil - No.
So the actual Olympics themselves. - Amazing

The episodes aren't out of order.

Repeat after me: They're not out of order.

If they were out of order, why would he go back and encourage them to keep travelling with him? 

Plus, we know because of the souvenirs that the Power of Three takes place after Asylum of the Daleks and Dinosaurs on a Spaceship. A town called Mercy takes place during the Power of Three (as we know from their clothing and final dialogue of that episode)

Furthermore, the Doctor couldn't visit them in those days anymore. It wasn't established as fixed. (their whole lives have become fixed due to those events in Angels take Manhatten) 

The Doctor could only visit Amelia on the night she waited. Because that's what was what already happened. (as you can notice in the Eleventh Hour)

It's still true though.

I don't have an axe to grind, except that I think you're wrong and I wanted to point that out. You seem to think that you deserve better from your previous employer, but my view is that that has nothing to do with the subject of MPs travel expenses. Nothing. Not a thing. It's anecdotal.

&gt; It does have everything to do with MPs - it is comparing the pay, perks and expenses of two employers, regardless of where the money comes from.

And that comparison in a vacuum does nothing. Your job had a less generous expense policy than an MPs, perhaps. Again that is a completely valueless comparison to everyone except you.

One thing you haven't done is mention what role you had at this organization. That will be the largest determinant on what your company's expense policy would be for your travel. It still doesn't matter though. It's still anecdotal.

&gt; The money taken from my pay is my money, it's not yours. Combined with everyone else's it is ours, sure, but that wasn't my point.

true,Dossena,null,null,"ElevenReds has covered pretty much our entire current team, so I'd like to cover some important people and events from our past:

* [Bill Shankly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shankly): Basically built this club. Manager from 1959 to 1974. Responsible from dragging the club up from the second division and turning them into a major force in football. Won 3 top flight titles, 2 FA cups, 4 Charity Shields and a UEFA Cup with the team. Honoured at Anfield by The Shankly Gates and a bronze statue. 

* [Bob Paisley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Paisley):  Liverpool player from 1939 to 1954 and then Manager from 1974 to 1983. One of the greatest managers ever. During his time managing the team we won; 6 top flight titles, 3 League cups, 6 Charity shields, 1 UEFA cup, 1 UEFA Super cup  and 3 European cups.  After his death in 1996 The Paisley Gates were opened at one of the entrances to Anfield. 

* [Joe Fagan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Fagan): Manager from 1983 to 1985. During this time he won us the treble; The league, league cup and European cup all in the one season. 

* [Kenny Dalglish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Dalglish): Liverpool Legend. AKA King Kenny. Played for us from 1977 to 1990. Spent two spells managing us; 1985-1991 and more recently 2011-2012. During his first spell as manager we won; 3 league titles, 2 FA cups and 4 Charity shields. During his second spell he lead us to League Cup victory. The clubs first trophy for 6 years. Came in to steady the ship after Roy Hodgson left, but was let go after we finished 8th. Some feel he was hard done by - he got the team playing well again but wasn't getting the results. Had to deal with not having Lucas for the majority of the season and Gerrard + Suarez missing quite a few games through injuries and bans. Didn't help his cause that some of his buys were a bit iffy. 

* [Rafa Benitez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafa_Benitez): Manager from 2004 to 2010. Lead us to 1 FA Cup win, a Community shield win, a UEFA Super Cup win and the 2005 Champions League win. Also got us finishing 2nd in the league during 2008-09 season. Played a big part in developing the club's youth development; starting to see it pay off in the likes of Suso who said: ""I was going to sign for Real Madrid but one day before it the phone rang and Rafael Benitez spoke to me. He convinced me that Liverpool was the club for me and after that I had to change my plans. I was going to come to Liverpool."" 

* [Robbie Fowler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Fowler): AKA God. Fan favourite. Played for us from 1993 to 2001 and then again from 2006 to 2007. Scoring 183 goals in total for the club. 

* [Ian Rush](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Rush): LFC's top goal scorer with 346 for the club in all competitions. Played for us from 1980 to 1996 (minus the one year he was at Juventus for) 

* [Michael Owen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Owen) Wonder kid star striker turned snidey money-grabbing Judas. Played for us from 1996 to 2004. An incredibly talented and important player for us during his time at the club. Then decided to run his contract down, get sold on the cheap to Real Madrid, ignore us for Newcastle (and more money) then join the enemies Man United just to top it off. Currently found warming Stoke City's bench. 

* [Fernando Torres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Torres): AKA El NiÃ±o. Played for us from 2007 to 2011. Was a fan favourite during this time and one of the greatest strikers in the league. Then decided break all our hearts by jumping ship on the last day of the January transfer window to rivals Chelsea. Leaving the club scrambling to find a replacement (and therefore spending over the odds on Carroll). Currently being a bit of a passenger at Chelsea, getting the odd easy goal while Hazard and Mata do all the work. Still, we took Chelsea for Â£50million for him. 

* [Xabi Alonso](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso): AKA The Beard/Red Beard. Ex-Liverpool midfield maestro (2004â2009) and still a big fan of the club based on tweets and interviews. Currently at Real Madrid. 

* [Sami Hyypia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sami_Hyypia): Former Reds defender (1999â2009). A rock at the back with a knack for scoring. Current manager of Bayer Leverkusen. 

* [Andrea Dossena](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Dossena): AKA Bossena. AKA The Dossenator. AKA The Boss Senator. An all time Liverpool legend. Scorer of wonder goals against Real Madrid AND Manchester United. In the same week. 


* [Hillsborough Disaster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster) : One of the worlds worst football disasters. 15 April 1989 at the Hillsborough Stadium (home to Sheffield Wednesday). During an FA Cup Semi Final between us and Nottingham Forrest a human crush (due to too many people being directed into the one area) resulted in the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans. Worst of all was the way the disaster was covered up by the local police to make it look as if it was the Liverpool fans (including those who died) that were responsible for the disaster. British ""newspaper"" The Sun ran a bullshit story; ""The Truth"" (far from it) detailing how the Liverpool fans were drunk and responsible for it and a whole load of other lies giving them a bad name. Leading to the families and fans campaigning for Justice and for the actual truth to come out. Recently a major victory was had when the police files from then were released proving there was a major cover up. A huge step towards getting justice for those who lost their lives that day. 

* [Luis Suarez Racism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su%C3%A1rez#Racial_abuse_incident): During a game between us and Man United, the Man United defender Patrice Evra claimed afterwards that our player Suarez had racially abused him (up to 10 times). No actual proof (in the form of video evidence) was found to back this up so it lead to a Evra's word vs Suarez's word argument. The FA (famous for being shit at everything) decided to believe Evra because Suarez was deemed unreliable in that he changed his story several times. What was said, and how it was meant, exactly is unknown. Either way Suarez received an 8 game ban and a lifetime of boos  from opposing fans because of it.

I have used Premier who were ridiculous on checks on keeping the place clean. We are not massively messy but they were basically bringing around a white glove and checking for mess. They ended up taking money off our deposit for minor things. When we moved in the house was in a state so we were not happy about them taking money off for mess. That being said they were idiots and gave us double the initial deposit back so we actually made money!

We then used Beehive ltd I would stay aways from these guys as they seem like back alley sort of people who are looking to get as much money off you as possible. The owner seemed very dodgy I would not be surprised if they were investigated some dirt would come up. On the surface they seemed really good, poor lack of judgement on our part for using them. The house on the surface looked good but after a few weeks of living in it everything started to fall apart. Chairs all broke, sofa collapsed, etc.. We were not doing anything wild the most wild thing that happened to the chairs is they were sat on......which is what I think a chair should handle. The house was a mess when we moved in as well. I had condom wrappers left in my room for example, not exactly nice. They obviously took money off for the ""broken"" furniture which I thought they charged too much for but you are the one bent over in that situation so not much you can really do.

We are now with Hutton &amp; Parker who I would say are the best out of an interesting bunch they just seem to take a long time to get things sorted. One of our showers was leaking for ages and it took them ages to fix it. They sometimes do turn up unannounced which is a little annoying but we are still with them. Agents true colours only really come out once deposit money is involved as this is where they make a majority of their money!

true,RobertTheSpruce,null,null,"Well, Labour have said to union leaders, that their cuts in Fire would be less. Should we believe them? They are politicians, so probably not.

The 02-03 strikes were mainly about pay. Firefighter salaries had been frozen at a minimal amount for years, and so the FBU decided to ask for a whopping great 40%ish pay hike. No government would ever just say yes to that. So they of course said no, and counteroffered 10%. After much negotiation, they settled on 16% and and better pension scheme, which raised the retirement age to 55 if 30 years have been served, and an *option* to continue to 60, and retirement age protection at age 55 for those joining before 2006. So 60 if you came into the job late, which of course was shit. Importantly those strikes also allowed retained (on-call) firefighters equal pay and pensions with wholetime (full-time) firefighters who did the same job. They also gave us additional responserbility, ensuring fire takes charge of conventional/chemical/biological/nuclear/radiological attacks and incidents, which involved them buying a metric fuckton of cool new equipment.

Some of that was good, other bits were shit.

This year we asked for a 5% increase in pay. To bring us back up to inflation. The police had it. We did not. We got 1%. Not grea, but it puts us to exactly Â£13 an hour. Reasonable to me, but I'm in the minority on that one.

Pension contributions have already increased significantly, making more and more pull out of the already expensive scheme. Since it is a PAYG scheme rather than an invested scheme, that risks it collapsing. But we took that too. The reason being we would get close to zero public support since everyone is being raped by this government.

The straw that is breaking the camels back is the retirement age. They want to hike it to 60 for everybody and take the option of early retirement off the table. No matter how long you have completed in the job. Once you have completed your 30 years (I will be 52) of pension contributions and maxxed it out, you will continue paying into it until 60, for no additional benefit... This is the way I understand it at least. I do not claim to be a pension/financial expert.

If you join the job late, then you accept these conditions, to work until 60, because you are told them. You don't have to take the job, but for those of us already in the thick of it, are being royally screwed. tests have told us that the most difficult job a firefighter can do, it fight a compartment fire. To achieve this you need a VO2 max (fitness) level of 35. Because Fire Services love to have a margin for error, they set it to 42. Between the ages of 50 and 59, if your VO2 level 45 or above, then you are considered to be He-Man. This will cause people to be sacked on medical grounds. Dismissal on the grounds of lack of fitness, will be a a probability for 3 out of 4 firefighter. I'd hate to see what percentage of female firefighter are able to achieve that.

There are more strikes coming, unless the Tories change their stance significantly. There are already sporadic strikes in some counties. Worth noting, that now, all the ""Green Goddesses"" have been scrapped, and brigades are resorting to giving desk jockeys and pencil pushers a days training, to throw water at fire. Training usually takes 16 weeks, and then a further year on on the job training to achieve full competence. I'm sure everyone will be fine with that...

TL;DR? All governments in my lifetime have been shit. On the face of it, the last one was slightly better than the current one in my opinion, but they do have time to change it, by being fair.

edit: I accidentally used the female average VO2 max levels. Which are naturally, not as high. Changed now. Still looks bad.

We should be able to argue from an honest position but as the corporations involved are fundamentally dishonest in reporting their profits to reduce their tax liabilty (through a variety of practices whether its asset swaps, shell companies in tax havens or whatever) we need a figure to place the amount they actually paid into perspective, since the profit figure is so horribly distorted.

Regarding the tax rate, [here](www.hmrc.gov.uk/budget2012/excheq-income-tax-2042.pdf) is an interesting report from HMRC that anticipated the reduction in the rate. You're right, insofar as they only had a full financial year to look back on regarding the tax, and the two years before in order to see how people anticipated it and adjusted their behaviour to minimise their exposure to it. However there is also a significant amount of data to draw on from the US and Europe, and the OECD, to suggest that the increased tax rate was damaging the economy. The report linked cites the substitution effect, where productivity in the labour market is reduced as people no longer see the payoff for additional work. It also cites the mobility of capital and individuals, and a reduction in foreign direct investment, as actual and potential side effects of the tax, noting that if the tax remained for a significant period it could account for up to 2.5% of GDP. Also remember that corporation tax hikes are often considered the most damaging for economic growth. The OECD recommend a wider corporate tax base with reduced rates both to encourage more honesty in disclosure and to attract outside business. [This report](http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/taxation/tax-policy-reform-and-economic-growth_9789264091085-en) (it's only a preview that I could find but it is all accessible in the browser window) has some interesting stuff on tax planning. p.96/97 has an interesting discussion on the difficulties in weighing up corp. tax strategies, and the tables at the end of the report show interesting data.

What you said about capital gains is interesting, and you're bang on about tax avoidance. The problem is, when big companies avoid tax the government is so over a barrel, as on one hand they want the money and don't want to appear a soft touch and establish a bad precedent, but on the other hand (let's use Starbucks as an example) companies can and do use their size and importance in local economies to get what they want out of governments. 8,500 jobs is a shitload of leverage, and omnishambles wouldn't even begin to describe the backlash if major companies took the nuclear option. Aon recently abandoned the US (for the UK in fact) due to tax issues, taking a shitload of jobs with them. They're fuckers, and it's like governments are riding monsters that they daren't dismount.

I must admit I don't know the rationale or the numbers behind NHS reform, which is kind of embarrassing as I did work in it as a desk drone for a while! I'm sure you're right though. And yeah, the internet snooping plan should feckin die.

Much of this is devil's advocate, but thanks for your response, as I don't want to sound dickly but most (not all!) of the people I've spoken to about the 'sod the cuts' business never did the legwork and aren't interested in whether it was right or wrong, but instead are just 'playing 1980's' and giving the Tories a kicking because they were brought up being told the Tories were bad.

Though, I couldn't help but wonder if there would be some crazy bit of misfortune and Reading sneaks in the equalizer. Thankfully that didn't happen.

I agree with many of the thoughts that have been posted. Just to add some quick observations:

* Sterling's talent is obvious but I feel as if his maturity on the pitch relative to his age is what sets him apart. For the most part, he is calm and collected. 

* I really liked the brief work that Enrique and Johnson did together. Also, to me, I feel as if we're very lucky to have two players that are as versatile as them.

* I feel as if many are clamoring for a striker but - as much as I love transfer speculation (it's a maddeningly guilty pleasure) - I am attempting to bite my tongue about any of this sort of stuff until we sort out what we have. We have about twelve League matches until the end of the year plus our Europa and League Cup matches. That's *a lot* of time for someone to emerge as a regular goal-scorer (alongside Suarez, of course): Sterling? Suso? Jonjo? Assaidi? We have lots of options and I, for one, would like to see which player emerges as a goal-scorer.

6. "". . . the U.S. is unique. And just as we have the world's most advanced economy, military, and technology, we also have its most advanced oligarchy.

    In a primitive political system, power is transmitted through violence, or the threat of violence: military coups, private militias, and so on. In a less primitive system more typical of emerging markets, power is transmitted via money: bribes, kickbacks, and offshore bank accounts. Although lobbying and campaign contributions certainly play major roles in the American political system, old-fashioned corruption--envelopes stuffed with $100 bills--is probably a sideshow today, Jack Abramoff notwithstanding.

    Instead, the American financial industry gained political power by amassing a kind of cultural capital--a belief system. Once, perhaps, what was good for General Motors was good for the country. Over the past decade, the attitude took hold that what was good for Wall Street was good for the country. The banking-and-securities industry has become one of the top contributors to political campaigns, but at the peak of its influence, it did not have to buy favors the way, for example, the tobacco companies or military contractors might have to. Instead, it benefited from the fact that Washington insiders already believed that large financial institutions and free-flowing capital markets were crucial to America's position in the world. . . .""

true,Tven0,english,Warwickshire,"*According to the Sunday Times, eBay had sales of Â£789m during 2010 in the UK at its four British subsidiaries. Using its worldwide profit margin of 23%, it would have made a profit in the UK of Â£181m, leading to corporation tax owed of Â£51m. Instead, it paid Â£1.2m.*

It is unethical. It has four British subsidiary companies and the reporters calculated that the companies made Â£181m of PROFIT (not revenue, profit) in the UK between them. If that profit was taxed at the current rate of corporation tax the four businesses would owe Â£51m in total. Instead they paid Â£1.2m between them with a deferred tax bill of only Â£700k. So how did they pull it off? I shall explain.

**What they are doing is an indicator of unethical behaviour.** Executives at the top of the company would have had to knowingly make this decision as it involves 'splitting' the business into sister companies or subsidiaries. So they knew the purpose of this and therefore are acting unethically by using a loophole to reduce their tax.

eBay are doing the same thing Starbucks is doing. They have 'subsidiary' companies based in the UK. These sister companies have to pay an intellectual property royalty fee back to the main business. **This fee is the same as the profit.** So any profit earned in the UK, through a loophole in tax law, counts as not being profit but a royalty fee. HMRC allows companies to deduct intellectual property fees from taxable income. If those fees are the same as the profit, then the business can record a loss in the UK and therefore pay little to no tax. Meanwhile all the profit earned in the UK gets siphoned off to the US for example in the form of a fee. Again, it won't get taxed in America because it is a royalty fee paid by their sister company for 'renting' the intellectual property of eBay/Starbucks. It doesn't count as profit or taxable income earned by the 'main' business. They are essentially running eBay UK or Starbucks UK at a loss.

If that isn't morally questionable I don't know what is. They are cheating their own home nation as well as any countries they work in. They are acting within the confines of the law but are making it bend over backwards for them.

true,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"&gt;There's a lot of evidence that taxes above a certain level actually reduce the total tax take, due to a range of factors like economic disincentives, capital flight and 'crowding out' (the fact that Hollande is so quickly and aggressively having to backtrack on his French election promises when faced with the 'real world' is a classic example).

I agree that above a certain level taxes will reduce the total tax take, but I don't agree that that the taxes we have in the UK are at the optimum level. The top rate of income tax in the UK was 60% up until 1988, and since it has been cut the tax taken as a percentage of GDP has never recovered to pre-1988 levels. This is why I don't believe the argument that a top rate of tax of 50% was too high - assuming we are aiming to raise as much tax as possible. 

By 'crowding out' do you mean the public sector crowding out the private sector, taking employees etc that the private sector would have used? Because this is what the government said was happening before they started cutting spending but it has been proved false - the private sector didn't take up the slack and grow to replace the shrinking public sector too - this is why we are now in recession.

As for Hollande I haven't been following what has been going on in France that closely but I know he has just introduced a top rate of tax of 75% as he promised, what has he backtracked on?

&gt;We can all hope for a more prosperous future, but we might just have to live with the fact that we can't all be rich at humanity's current level of technological advancement, and be thankful that our 'poor' are still very wealthy by world standards.

Well yeah I agree our poor by our rich by world standards, we are the 7th largest economy in the world (we were the 6th largest before the latest austerity caused recession). My worry is how long this will continue, given that the rich are benefiting the most in the boom times and the poor are suffering the most in recessions. For example we currently have record youth unemployment coupled with a government that wants to eliminate housing benefits for under 25s. If we are such a prosperous nation, and the rich have undoubtedly gained so much from the boom up until 2008, surely it would be right for the rich to pay more so that some young people are not left jobless, homeless and hopeless.",0,1350844600,null,0,false,0,c6pr6ee,t3_11snbh,t1_c6pr6ee,t1_c6pmvb1,null,1430204783,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Its not a calculation its an assumption.

&gt;What they are doing is an indicator of unethical behaviour. Executives at the top of the company would have had to knowingly make this decision as it involves 'splitting' the business into sister companies or subsidiaries. So they knew the purpose of this and therefore are acting unethically by using a loophole to reduce their tax.

No again, YOU assume its an indicator of unethical behaviour but it might not be, this is why they're being investigated. If there was any concrete evidence of what you say then the BBC(or someone else) would be reporting it.

I'm not supporting starbucks or ebay. I'm simply pointing out that there's very little proof either way. All these figures could easily be explained by ethical and legal activities.

true,tonystardis,tardis,TARDIS,"1)Fantasy is a genre of fiction that commonly uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in imaginary worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genre of science fiction by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific themes, though there is a great deal of overlap between the two, both of which are sub genres of speculative fiction.
2) Science fiction is a genre of fiction dealing with imaginary but more or less plausible (or at least non-supernatural) content such as future settings, futuristic science and technology, space travel, parallel universes, aliens, and paranormal abilities. Exploring the consequences of scientific innovations is one purpose of science fiction, making it a ""literature of ideas"". 3)  ""science fantasy"" is either a science fiction story that has drifted far enough from reality to ""feel"" like a fantasy, or a fantasy story that is attempting to be science fiction.

&gt;I'm not supporting starbucks or ebay. I'm simply pointing out that there's very little proof either way. All these figures could easily be explained by ethical and legal activities.

Well, lets take a look at this. Heres a guardian infographic from a few days ago comparing the corporation tax from a few large internationals. 

http://i.imgur.com/Ks90B.jpg

Lets take a look at Starbucks. According to this data they lose 7.5p for every pound spent in their store, and have paid no corporation tax whatsoever.

If I was running a store, or chain of stores, where my costs are more than my revenue, I would be out of business in pretty short order. And yet (so wikipedia tells me) Starbucks have got 790 stores in the UK. 

So theyve losing money hand over fist, but are still opening new stores - so it doesnt take a genius to see that they are blatantly misrepresenting their finances in the UK to entirely avoid paying tax instead of merely being content to minimise their obligation.

&gt;R/Uk'S anti-business stance is hugely frustrating. I run my own business and could quite easily skew my corporation tax for a given year in what ever direction I so fancied. It couldn't be taken as an indication of anything by anyone but my accountant.

I hardly think we can be called ""anti-business"" if corporation tax is only paid on profits - we largely object to money being funnelled out of the country before minimal corporation tax is paid on the profits that have magically appeared on the balance sheet in a different country to where the revenue was generated.

Indeed, as a small business owner, shouldnt you be pissed off about this as well? These large multinationals are de facto more competitive than you precisely because they can structure their tax affairs like this while you (depending on size) might find it doesnt pay to have a similar structure so you have to eat the cost of doing business ""legitimately"" (where ""legitimately"" means not blatantly taking the piss like starbucks are doing, for example"").",0,1350847806,null,0,false,0,c6ps0a2,t3_11ufhq,t1_c6ps0a2,t1_c6prb4u,null,1435676600,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Well they did, but he had already done them. And if he hadn't, then he wouldn't have. 

There is 0 indications anywhere that those events had taken place after they were gone. 

Besides, since when have episodes been out of order in perspective of the Doctor? They're always perfectly in order. It's our line, our point of reference. It wouldn't make any sense to screw around with it and then not make it clear at all. 

&gt;Why would he say that he has swings to swing on

Because it's in the script and Moffat is a giant troll. Why else would he put Coleman in the show before the new companion is actually there? Why else would he troll with the flickering lights and christmas references? It's just what he does, he likes to mess with people. Did you know how many 'clues' people have found in every episode/series? A lot more than were ever actually used/meant anything. 

Besides, it's just an expression really. He just sillyfied it, very much in character indeed.

true,bad-at-Reddit,null,null,"Mate, this is the kind of picture Facebook footie pages share. On an intelligent forum you should be explaining both sides of the story and not just a one sided view like that in the picture.

Both of these events are really not that comparable because when AVB left Chelsea went on to win the Champions League and F.A cup while Mancini even after those matches ended the season on a low.

So Chelsea had the players to do a lot more than what AVB achieved with the same squad, in fact it was so bad that even before the investments Chelsea did not have that bad of a season for more than a decade. Di Matteo also didn't even bother playing a single player who was going to play in the champions league final for two matches and benched so many other regulars just to make sure their focus was on the CL and still he got better results in the league than AVB.

Lampard has slowly been benched at Chelsea by Di Matteo too, even against Spurs he came on with less than 5-10 minutes go and he didn't even get that in some of the last couple of games. Does he cry and whine? He has not said a word. In fact he has said these things (summarized quotes) which are related to him being benched :

* Before my mother died she asked me not to leave Chelsea, I want to end my career here.

* Sitting on the bench is not easy but the club comes before you and as long as we are going in the right direction I'm happy.

* I will earn my place in the squad and RDM has the final decision.

Honestly if you cannot ""man manage"" Frank Lampard who is one of the most intelligent and level headed professionals in todays game then you really do need to work on your peoples skill which lets face it, we all know AVB seriously lacks. Lampard never had a problem with a single manger in his long career and stood by every one of them. He even wished AVB the best for the future and all his managers speak of him in high praise. Even if AVB is a tactical genius he still has this skill to learn which on its own is what keeps you at your club and motivates your player.

Right now Spurs are doing pretty decent but the real truth about AVB's skill will come out when the chips are down and he gets into serious trouble.",0,1350849758,null,0,false,0,c6psj1t,t3_11uabu,t1_c6psj1t,t1_c6po5fq,null,1430205417,-2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,-2

On the one hand I want to blow raspberries. I should ask you why would you bother saving if the sky if falling in and you should be making clothes out of tires and growing a Mohican

However I would prefer to call bullshit and say that you can always save (unless you have debts to clear, always do that first). A deposit for a house is a great idea, but if you don't have an emergency fund (3 months salary is a fair figure) you risk ending up in debt due to some unforeseen event.

http://www.bridlingtonfreepress.co.uk/news/local/bollards-to-beat-travellers-1-2725583

&gt;  Published on Monday 13 September 2010 14:26

&gt;  STEPS are being taken to put an end to an **annual invasion** of playing fields by travellers.

&gt;  After complaints by local residents and pressure from their councillor, East Riding of Yorkshire Council has agreed to install a range of concrete filled steel bollards down the edge of Bridlington Sports Centre's playing fields off Well Lane By-pass.

&gt;  In the past travellers have torn down wire mesh fencing, **and during the latest incident at the end of July this year, removed a fence post, to get vehicles and caravans on to the sports field.**

&gt;  Coun Richard Burton, of Old Town and Central Ward, said: ""I have had a lot of complaints over the past three years from people living in Gypsey Road and in Wayside Crescent which overlooks the field.

&gt;  ""It takes up to 20 days to remove the travellers, who are there illegally and there is always a lot of clearing up to do. Now the council has taken the decision to put these posts in to prevent access from Well Lane, or at least slow them up at this very visible location, so action can be taken before they get on to the land.""


That'll be the same fence post I posted a link to on Google Streetview. http://goo.gl/maps/6vuzO

My reasoning was that King Charles I was able to rally a Royalist cause against Parliament, and that the consensus that grew up post-restoration was to limit the Monarch's public influence in politics to avoid a repeat power struggle.

I've never had a problem with the idea that a monarch (or other royals) can converse with and influence government in secret, because the government's actions are subject to public scrutiny, and indeed this is the role of parliament, as well as the electorate. 

If it's understood that the Monarch doesn't speak publicly on political matters then government ministers have no fear in ignoring their views, because they're not going to risk the wrath of public opinion for doing so.

If you have a problem with government policy you can take it up with government ministers, and your MP. You can start a petition that will make its way to the Back Bench Business committee and Parliament.

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"Sometimes goals and assists are not everything and I understand when people make that point (Who understand this statement) but what Arsenal fans are doing is taking this clichÃ© statement and applying it to defend their every argument.

Only a handful of them watch other teams play apart from Arsenal, heck I'd bet my salary that they didn't even learn anything about Mata/Hazard even when we emptied their stadium a couple of weeks back. Where was Cazorla that day? In Mikel's back pocket. He looked average and was not even their best player. Why not show up and be the messiah you are hailed as when you are needed?

He had an absolute shitter of a game and their defense for that is that ""he is playing a deeper role"". They say that for practically every single match he plays at average and when you are contesting with Mata and Hazard then average is just not good enough.

A deeper role as in what? Was he playing the Mikel role? Because I certainly saw Hazard providing more defensive cover and stealing the ball more than him. 

Was he playing the deep lying play maker? Because I certainly saw Mata doing that twice as good as him throughout the season in that position. 

I have watched this guy play before he was at Arsenal and there was absolutely nothing about him that should have made all the Arsenal fans predict him as the best player in the Premiership who was going to be much better than Hazard/Mata. Their basic point was that he was the best player outside of the top two in the Spanish league, the idiots forgot that Mata was that player before he left only after which point did Cazorla start getting the nods. The fact that they predicted all these things before Cazorla played a single match says it all.

Another point they make is the money to value bull crap. What are they seriously smoking? One is a young player who was being persuaded by one top club from every top league and the other was an older guy who no one even bothered to get into a genuine bidding war for. Now the Arsenal fans who slag Wenger after every bad result are saying that Wenger was a genius who saw this amazing talent when in reality Wenger himself said in a statement that Hazard was out of their reach. So they basically got a knock off while we got the real thing. Do they even understand basic demand and supply? That market value alone makes Hazard worth more than Cazorla even ignoring all the extra talent and age advantage he has.

And then their best and last point which is ""stats are not everything"". Sure, whatever helps you sleep at night. The fact of the matter is that Mata and Hazard are better players and have been playing better both on stats and in flesh. I watch more than 90% of Arsenal matches because I am expecting them to lose all the time. They play in such a fragile way that it just makes me very happy to watch them play like a mediocre side which makes so many mistakes. This is why I ask my friends fixture timings of Arsenal games by saying ""What time are Arsenal losing today"" instead of ""What time is the Arsenal game on"". The same thing happened yesterday with Norwich, I was watching the entire match from minute 1, heck I watched it again in the back ground on TV - while Redditing to relive the moment and laugh at those fucker.

If you watched Cazorla play then you would laugh at his fluke shots. He literally hits the ball like he has masturbated 3 times pre-game and has no power left in his foot. His shot crawls to the keeper slower than Luiz's back passes to Cech or is horribly off target. That is why that one long range goal from him got like 1,000 upvotes from Arsenal fans on /r/Soccer because he wasted 1,000 easy opportunities to get that good goal. Another one of his goal was beating the keeper on his near post where the keeper nearly stopped the ball. The guy missed tap ins and Arsenal fans completely forget it!. If Hazard/Mata were given half as easy chances as those tap ins then they would have buried them because even if you are some sort of magical deep lying play maker, a player with skill and vision has enough ability to at least put in the tap ins from 5 yard outs.

Hazard/Mata either blast the ball with power or sidefoot/lace curl it, Cazorla puts in all his power and then his end result is equivalent to the side foot by our players plus it has less accuracy. Make a Semi-Bias Arsenal fan read these last couple of lines and he will tell you how right I am. This isn't even anything new, He has always been like this as long as I have seen him play. I bet all the Arsenal fans started liking him after he joined them and they searched for him on Youtube. It took them 15 minutes after that to hail him as the future of the Premiership.

Bottom line, Arsenal fans have this void left inside of them after Fabregas. They are trying to make Cazorla their new and improved Fabregas when in reality Cesc was/is still much better. They overlook every single mistake of Cazorla and they are sure no one is taking him away since Madrid/Barca passed on him already. On paper and in flesh both our mids are much better than him. When they play the sit back role they are still much better than him and when they want to carry the team and take on the entire back line they completely decimate him. 

I would cry myself to sleep every single night of my life if we exchanged this guy+15m+Theo-one-way-lane-Walcott for either Hazard/Mata. Give Arsenal fans the same choice and just see how quickly they will change their opinion on Cazorla and Mata/Hazard.

Not sure about traditional martial arts as they simply don't interest me but there are a some good MMA clubs about. Particularly

http://www.gym01.com/facilities/ 

IIRC is one some friends go to and really rate it, both the coaching and facilities. It seems to have basically the best reputation on the south coast, they have a bunch of pro and semi-pro fighters training out of there and they do regular BJJ only sessions if you aren't interested in stand up fighting at all. I recommend giving some stand up MMA/ Muay Thai a go. It is really good stuff.


I'll also put in a plug for crossfit brittania which is a great place to train, cheap (for a crossfit gym and what it is) and are just about to move to a bi  new premises by the sainsbury's in farlington as soon as planning permission comes through in the next few weeks.  They are in a room in Fort Purbrook now which has become too small for the busier sessions.

Crossfit more than most things has a direct transfer over to martial arts as well because it is high intensity functional movements, a lot of use of explosive power and strength etc and a lot of places particularly in the US where it is much bigger either use crossfit, a particular adaptation of it or apply a similar methodology to the fitness aspects of their martial arts training.

Yet when they're not in the position to do either, they're making runs off of the ball so that someone else can make/take chances.

I am not saying that Smith is the worst Doctor of all. But I do have to argue that he just doesn't have the qualities I loved in other doctors such as Troughton, Tom Baker, Eccleston and Tennant. These qualities are not really about Smith, as much as they are about a directorial direction and writing.

As I explained earlier, the thing I loved about Doctor(s) is their ability to get genuinely excited about everything, and see beauty of life even in potentially dangerous and villainous characters. Remember Eccleston's approach to encountering Autons - he quotes the peace proclamations in order to offer the alien life-form a last chance at a peaceful resolution before he decides to combat them for the sake of Earth.

Or how about Torchwood - Tennant decidedly goes against the Prime Minister at some point, destroying her career, because she carelessly ignored his advice and destroyed an alien ship even though he ensured the ship will not attack Earth. He destroyed her career with a single sentence, not by ordering her shot by a platoon of goons.

Moffat's direction does something quite different. For one, in Dinosaurs on the Spaceship, he KILLS a man. That is actually a huge delineation from the traditional Doctor, who, unless you account for some psychotic moments in Colin Baker era, generally refrains from killing.

Smith is quick-paced, neurotic, obsessed with fuzzy feelings and loves children. That alone does not appeal to me as much as what Davis accomplished with his revival of Doctor Who - a Timelord who genuinely loves the universe, aliens, humans, and nurtures all intelligent life wherever it may hail from. And is genuinely excited by all of it. And Smith severely lacks that quality. 

For example, in the 2011 Christmas special, the Doctor, The Widow and The Wardrobe - by all means a deliciously rich production - the Doctor's response to the woody aliens who are trying to literally escape with their lives and save their entire species/civilization from being destroyed is to treat them like enemies. He doesn't actually show concern for their survival, or understand their predicament. Mostly, he is just babysitting, and badly. 

In order to accommodate the madness, Moffat has changed some of the best villains into, well...changed them as much as the Borg changed over the years in ST, but faster.

Daleks, we learned in the Asylum of the Daleks, now have a parliament - WTF?! (Amy, we found out, is also impervious to nanites that changed everyone into Daleks - not sure why or how)

And Cybermen, who are incredibly frightening,  can apparently be defeated by a chubby, dull James Corden, who only has to click his magic heels to stop the conversion process in order to save his crying child.

I am missing a lot, in Smith's performance, in choice of companions, in writing, in direction of the entire show.

**Dempsey:**

2011/2012 season Clint scored 23 goals in 45 appearances (.51 goals/match) for Fulham, with 6 game-winning strikes and two goals in two matches against Chelsea to enable two 1-1 draws. 

2012/2013 season Clint has had a pass completion percentage of 80.7% in nine appearances for Spurs (26.2 passing attempts/match).

2012/2013 season Clint has averaged a game rating of 6.74 according to whoscored.com

2012/2013 has been dispossessed 5 times, given away 4 turnovers, and earned 1.6 fouls/game. 

2012/2013 has averaged 1 tackle/match.

**Sigurdsson:** 

2011/2012 season Gylfi scored 8 goals in 37 appearances (.22 goals/match)

2012/2013 season Gylfi has had a pass completion percentage of 73.6% in nine appearances for Spurs (10.2 passing attempts/match).

2012/2013 season Gylfi has averaged a game rating of 6.25 according to whoscored.com

2012/2013 has been dispossessed 5 times, given away 9 turnovers, and earned 0.8 fouls/game..

2012/2013 has averaged 0.8 tackle/match.

**Overall:**

2011/2012 Clint averaged 2.36 times Gylfi's goal/match ratio.

2012/2013 Clint averaged 1.10 times Gylfi's pass completion percentage (in 2.57 times more attempts/match).

2012/2013 season Clint has averaged a game rating 1.08 times that of Gylfi according to whoscored.com

2012/2013 Clint has given away 5 fewer turnovers, and earned twice as many fouls/game.

2012/2013 Clint has averaged 1.25 times as many defensive tackles/match.

2012/2013 Clint has scored 3 more International goals than Gylfi.


**Conclusion:**

I may be American, but the stats don't really paint the picture everyone claims of Gylfi &gt;&gt; Clint. Sure neither has played well and there have been few games on which to judge, but I fail to see how Clint gets such a resounding call for benching. Is his play sometimes at odds with AVB's system? sure. Has he proven himself as a goal scorer? yes. Should he be given the opportunity to expand moving forward in his role for the club before we all jump ship? perhaps.

I'm 22 years old and all I've known is Labour. You know what that means to me? Large student debt and no jobs, and no money safeguarded when the times were good. 

My parents asked for pretty much nothing from the gov't when I was growing up and we had just enough to have a holiday once a year, and if I asked for something for Christmas I'd get it (sometimes it was also a Bday present). I was raised to work hard for everything I get. So I've no interest in supporting Labours welfare culture and no interest in voting for a gov't who left the current one with a letter at the treasury saying (roughly): ""It's all gone, good luck!""

I have no idea what a Tory gov't is, because from what I can see any gov't that has had to deal with the conditions of the last 3 years would have had just as hard decisions and would just be as unpopular, and the Lib Dems have shown that even with a record number of voters they have no real power. Therefore my only logical vote is for Tory. When I see how they deal with a similar situation to what Labour had in the 90s and 00s then I can make a decision as to which is better.

I didn't grow up angry at Margaret Thatcher. I've grown up wondering why the fuck we spent so much during the 90s and sold our gold at possibly the worst possible time. 

And I'm being asked to look up to a guy like Ed Miliband as our potential leader?

Dempsey needs to be cut some slack. He isn't doing well but he is genuinely trying. I think the biggest problem people have with him is that he is not moutinho. He does seem to be a bit of a misfit in regards to the team, but I think he can come good.

I ripped at Gallas after the match because he was poor. I feel less aggrieved now, but he needs to get his head in the game. Same goes for Walker.

true,FaggotCaterpillar,BR,brazil,"That video does not do justice to the fucking incredible MIRACLE we managed to pull off last season! Everything that could have ever gone wrong went wrong, and yet somehow we managed to fucking scrape through ever so slightly to become FUCKING CHAMPIONS OF EUROPE!

Napoli: first game Cavani (who's playing extremely well at the moment) and the rest of them beat us 3-1, our manager gets sacked, our form is so shitty we're in like 7th or something in the premier league. Then with an interim manager taking over we win 3-1, then go into overtime and find an extra goal to pull through!

Benfica: Both games relatively easy compared to the rest, but still faced a lot of pressure at the very end, until Raul Meirelles scores a beautiful goal to our relief!

Barcemotherfuckinglona: Playing at home to what many many many assumed to be the best team in the world by miles, having a teeny tiny 20% possession and yet we still deny messi and co a goal and ramires passes it to Drogba to score from his left! The bridge is our home bitches! Then away from home, camp nou, versus motherfucking barcelona, couple minutes in and one of our centerbacks gets injured and goes off, then we concede a goal. Then our other centerback and captain gets sent off and they get another goal. We are waaaaaaaaaaay beyond fucked at this moment. They get a penalty, cech's twin brother (mr crossbar) denies messi, and then ramires scores a fucking beauty of a goal while simultaneously telling messi ""here, this is how you do it"" and during all of this we still only have like 20% possession. Then after enduring tons and tons of attempts and shots and pressure fernando torres scores a pretty weird goal in my opinion. Barcelona were so hellbent on scoring they left torres MILES of space. 2-2 and we go to the fucking finals baby!

Bayern: playing against bayern, in munich, in their stadium, without our captain, without ramires, with bertrand having his debut (in the fucking final of all times). Nothing for most of the game, just pure pressure by bayern. Then they score at the very very very end, things look grim, chelsea fans everywhere getting out cyanide pills. They had like 20 corners during the entire match, we had none.....until like the 87th minute. Despite everything going against us, mata crosses to drogba to fucking jam that ball in neur's top corner (if ya know what i mean). 

Extra time starts and our hero and savior from the ivory coast gives up a penalty. Again, everything going against us. Then Cech shows us why the fuck he's petr fucking cech and saves it! Holy shit im pretty sure I cried at this point. Then penalties come and AGAIN we get fucking shat on. Mata misses his, things look bad, we are a penalty down, cyanide pills standing by (figuratively of course). Then cech saves one! Then cech's twin saves another! Holy shit we're in the lead! ONE MORE FUCKING PENA---DIDIER MOTHERFUCKING DROGBA SCORES!!!! He cried, cech cried, abramovich cried, i cried, babies cried, even bayern cried, they must have been really happy.

sorry for the wall of text, but every time i think about the adversity they faced, and how they somehow managed to overcome it. Holy shit its inspirational!

Tuckers power comes from the fact he isn't a public face, he acts as a go between from the MP's to the press, and the fact the public (who decide on MP's fates) get all their infomation about them from the press.  So long as Tucker holds the right friends he controls who dies and survives from the public.  

Essentially, every MP wants to be on the good side of Tucker, as he can ""Bring on a tuckersized shitstorm"" so he's protected politically, and the press don't write a huge amount about him because when tucker brings his shitstorm to a MP, being on tuckers bad side means you don't get the story (usually a scandal or fuckup) and you loose revenue.

I've never been a huge fan of Walcott.  He seems to have an okay skill set and fantastic pace.  Give it one more injury or the ravages of time, and he'll only have an okay level of skill.  
Sturridge seems a bit whiny and doesn't seem to have the work rate I want in a player (but again, highlights only).

true,garyelofant,null,null,"ok you may not mean it, but i'm not liking the hostility im perceiving on your end.  i didn't think a response to my response merited this level of hostility so let me explain myself. 

see it didn't seem like the doctor was all that interested/in love until after the fact that she was gone.  during series 2 i never really got anything from him about how much he cared about her.  it honestly felt like the writers tried to pull this whole great love story out of some shitty plot they never really properly dealt with before in series 1 and 2 and used it during series 3 to add tension with the new companion.  and i just hate stuff like that.  i feel like it violates that rule everyone has about showing and not telling.  i felt like i was told to believe xyz out of a subpar plot point. 

I definitely felt rose's feelings for the doctor were blatant from the beginning. it was evident that she loved the doctor from 9 to 10.  i thought i got a glimpse of the doctor reciprocating during the end of series 1, but series 2 it never felt like it really except on maybe sort of on 1 or 2 occasions.  so not in my mind not really a well developed romance at all, especially since we are focusing on rose/10.  

series 1 it did feel like rose ""used"" some of the men she found along the way to make the doctor jealous.  it's not that she was completely trying to make him jealous, but it felt like she couldn't help but think of the idea.  i didn't think it was her end goal, but a part of what she tried to do with each guy.  whereas contrast with the doctor, it felt like he was attracted  to others and completely disregarded his feelings for rose if he ever really had any, whereas she didn't disregard her feelings for him.  to me it seemed one-sided on roses for the most part and thus why it seemed like she tried to make him jealous given the fact that she was also completely and utterly devoted to him.  

and yeah rose treated mickey like dirt.  sorry that's room for me to judge you badly in my book.   i can chalk that up to her immaturity and relative youth.  mickey and rose were definitely not right together, but that doesn't give her or the doctor an excuse for being jerks to mickey. if she didn't have any problem treating mickey like dirt, then i doubt she would have had any problem ""using"" guys to make the doctor jealous considering how often she would use mickey.  

all in all i thought the rose/10 romance was VERY poorly developed and was used rather badly later on for some added tension.  so it always seemed a little random and unbelievable to me that 10 mourned so much over rose because he was in love with her given what i saw in the past series.  i could believe he mourned so much for her because he loved her as a companion, but i thought he mourned madame de pompadour more because he loved her despite knowing her for 5 maybe 6 hours at most.

Out:

* 4m for Spearing

* 7m for Downing (sigh)

Funds: 53m

In: 

* Sahin, 14m
* Walcott, 12m (not a huge fan, but seems a bit more realistic than Schurrle)
* Heung-Min Sow, 6m - this one is just a gut feeling. We've been linked, but not seriously. Still, his desire, youth, relatively low pricing (I would assume, I kind of made up the 6m), and adaptability make him possible. I also think that the higher ups really want an Asian player to help in that market. 
* Cristian Tello, 10m (has he been settled this year? I kind of thought not but could be wrong)

That leaves 11m left over, which I think we would invest in youth or probably save for wages and the like. I like Brad Jones, I don't think we need to buy a backup keeper just yet. Same with Enrique/Robinson and LB. I also think we'll take a look at Zaha, but with Palace saying he's worth 20m, I don't see it happening.

Ade should start with Dempsey when we need to match up against the likes on Stoke and other tall squads. Dempsey could benefit from having Ade creating space and knocking balls down. I also thought Huddlestone looked like a decent replacement for Dembele, and Caulker is quickly looking like this year's Kaboul. I think striker is not really an urgent need in January; our most urgent need is a winger. With Bale's loss, we looked stagnant when attempting to attack through Dempsey. Lennon was clearly the most critical component against Chelsea. We have zero depth behind Bale and Lennon. AVB can't keep shoehorning players into trying to replicate what Bale and Lennon have. Someone with raw speed is critical to maintaining our attacking shape. We can make do with rotating JD and Ade, but neither will be able to perform well without having natural wingers on the wings.

Gylfi also takes all free chances so the key passes statistic may be skewed here (though I love his ability to place a free kick). Keep in mind Dempsey is just getting in to match form and has been under heavy work load at the international level. 

And I agree stats don't make the game. But a comparison of numerous statistics is also a more convincing argument than the passive observation of showing more ""effort."" Unfortunately the results, especially the goal scoring column, (though Dempsey is not the attacking center-piece of the team, his ability to find the back of the net can not be forgotten), is what matters at the end of the day. 

Also I have not stated that I believe one player should have preference over the other. Their role's and the way they approach the game is markedly different, and for each circumstance I believe they each must be considered.

They do a gear hire on the foot of the mountain which if I remember correctly is very reasonably priced.

Accommodation wise, I can't really help you with specifics, but there are plenty of youth hostels and bed and breakfasts either in the town itself or in one of the outer villages.

Defense we have Enrique/Robinson/Criscito, Skrtel/Agger/Coates/Kelly and Johnson/Wisdom/Flanno, GK with Reina/Jones/Gulasci.

Mbia is not just skillful, he scares the crap out of the opposition. I saw him with the ball being approach by an Everton player 3mts away; Mbia faked a lunge forwards with a scarey face. The Evertonian flinched and Mbia switched to his left in space. Quality stuff.

Thought our defence looked much better, still an occasional minor panic, but overall much improved.

Lots of good performances apart from our 2 strikers.
I thought Zamora mostly had a stinker of a game. If he's going to have the task of holding up the ball he'll need to win it in the air more and successfully pass it to our players. 

What we lack is a striker. Cisse is off his game still, lost his mojo. Because these 2 aren't scoring we're struggling.

Everton went down to 10 men with 30 mins to go. We should have won the game; it was a great opportunity.

Looks like our goals are going to have to come from mid-field. Back to the tactics of the end of last season when Cisse was banned a lot.

Hughes still does requests. The crowd calling for Cisse meant he came on instead of Mackie, who I heard Hughes was warming up.

true,Variola13,null,null,"&gt;Paying exorborant prices only serves to prolong their existence of such prices. If everybody in the world refused to pay such prices then there's a good chance that the drugs will fall in price to a more sensible price.

Unlikely, the cost of producing the drugs is still the same, and the cost is astronomical. Not only are you covering the cost of that drug in the price, but also of the alternative drugs researched to work in the same way but have failed. And it could have failed in at any point in the process, research on the bench is expensive enough, but when you start to get into clinical trials the costs escalate dramatically. 

&gt;Also, this is likely a monopoly market in terms of effectiveness. There are likely less expensive but effective drugs that do show significant imrpovements in sufferers. The reason they ask so much is because there's no other drug that is quite as good, yet.

Less expensive how? The overall price less expensive? If there is a drug discovered that is cheaper to actually produce, and has the same effect, then the R&amp;D costs will still be the same, you still have to go through the same process like you do any other drug. The cost to the drug company will till be the same, and this will be passed onto the consumer, in this case either the NHS or private health companies. 

&gt;It's a sad state of affairs, but that's just the world of greed and medicine.

Drug companies are not charities, they are businesses just like anything else. They employ clever people lots of money to make sure they stay in business and make money, money that is then put back into research as well as pleasing their shareholders. Why people have this attitude that drug companies should make a loss or even just break even on their products is beyond me, it's just not feasible that any company would do that.

true,ianjm,english,England,"Well, for starters, even the most ambitious timetable for Scottish independence would be to have the referendum in 2014. There would likely be several years of negotiations between our governments (there are huge issues to resolve such as oil rights and national debt). I can't see actual independence happening until 2018 at the earliest, although some ambitious people are saying 2016.

Also let's be clear - at the moment, as the opinion polls stand, Alex Salmond will not be getting a 'yes' vote.

Next, in the (reasonably unlikely) event that independence does get a yes and it does go ahead, the last thing either government will want to do is affect cross-border business. There are millions of Scots living in England and probably a million English people living in Scotland. Many businesses do trade across what would become the border, so it's in the interest of both economies not to screw anyone over. Treaties will be signed for freedom of movement, etc.

It's likely both countries will be part of the European Union - which is a common market guaranteeing freedom of movement for workers, freedom to do business, etc. 

If Scotland does leave the UK, it's possible there will be a majority of people in England who wish to secede from the EU in a possible referendum in a few years; if this happens it may make things slightly more complex but it's still very unlikely there will be any practical effect on business that spans the border, except for a potentially tragic increase in bureaucracy.

Scotland very much wants to remain part of the EU, and an independent Scotland may adopt the Euro before England, but I can't see this happening before the end of the decade given the issues with the economic crisis right now.

Basically, it won't make any difference in the short term.

Over a longer term, Scotland might end up with the Euro and more aligned with Europe than England does. But I would not expect any practical difference, apart from ultimately perhaps having to declare if your Visa is for Scotland or for England (but it's likely it'll work in both for many, many years).",0,1350890191,null,0,false,0,c6q1msn,t3_11vvg1,t1_c6q1msn,t3_11vvg1,null,1430209764,21,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,21

This is not about boosting profits at the customer's expense - the problem they are seeking to fix is a lack of profits.

Patents yes, but you are still ignoring the huge cost of researching and developing the drug, and getting it through clinical trials, all of which can take 10 years or more. Do you really think any company would risk all that money without a guarantee that for 10 years at least, some other company won't pinch their work and just produce the drug? 

&gt;Drug patents kill people and should be abolished.

No diseases kill people, a drug patent is a piece of paper. Being sensationalist doesn't help anything. If you abolish patents then you risk many more lives because no drug company will risk that amount of money on a drug and will not invest in the research. Also some drug companies contribute to charities than then fund academic research into diseases, that would be reduced too.

Perhaps then the solution would be to introduce an import duty on IP royalties.

If a foreign company has to pay import duty on physical products that they sell in the UK (typically 20%, but it varies, e.g. 48.5% if you're importing bicycles from China, [apparently](http://www.dutycalculator.com/help_center/Import-duty-taxes-when-importing-into-the-United-Kingdom/)) then foreign companies selling IP licensing ""products"" in the UK should pay something similar.

If starbucks are following a plan of aggressive expansion then spending all profits on opening new stores would not be unusual. Starbucks is known for predatory pricing(which isn't very nice but its not the point here) which involves stores running at a loss. 

&gt;If I was running a store, or chain of stores, where my costs are more than my revenue, I would be out of business in pretty short order. And yet (so wikipedia tells me) Starbucks have got 790 stores in the UK.

&gt;So theyve losing money hand over fist, but are still opening new stores - so it doesnt take a genius to see that they are blatantly misrepresenting their finances in the UK to entirely avoid paying tax instead of merely being content to minimise their obligation.

I think you've just demonstrated a complete misunderstanding of whats going on here. The profitability of individual stores is not in question. Its what happens to those profits that is being contended here.

&gt;we largely object to money being funnelled out of the country before minimal corporation tax is paid on the profits that have magically appeared on the balance sheet in a different country to where the revenue was generated.

So do I but I can't object to that until I see any conclusive evidence, I know from my own experience that all this ""evidence"" that's being sited can be explained by normal businesses practise.

If the BBC knew about it then so did everyone else in the media, including all the tabloids and rival news organisations that are being so quick to point the finger at the BBC.  Were they covering it up too?  No, they're just using any excuse to have a pop at the BBC.

The fact of the matter is that many people in the BBC were suspicious of his activities, along with people working in other media organisations, hospitals, children's homes, charities, and so on.  But despite all the suspicion, there was no proof and no victims had come forward to make any complaints.

This short report also ignores some pretty important factors, dividends are becoming more tax efficient as corporation tax is reduced (further reductions were promised in the previous budget too). This means there's more money to pay out and its increasingly better to pay out dividend rather than salary.

Also just before the 50% tax rate(which has an equivalent dividend rate) was introduced many company directors cleared all spare cash out of their companies with huge dividends. So I would imagine that in the year following the 50% rate we saw a huge reduction in dividend payouts and we could now be seeing a return to previous levels after that money has now been spent.

It is different for them. No more different than it is for many other organisations, but different than it is for the papers.

I don't want to appear to be defending Savile in any way, but technically speaking he probably wasn't a paedophile.  By definition a paedophile is someone who gains sexual gratification from *pre-*pubescent children.  My limited understanding based on the reports from his victims is that Savile was interested in young, but *post-*pubescent girls.  In one case a victim said something like ""He was more interested in my friend because I wasn't very well developed at the time"".  

Needless to say, child abuse is still child abuse, regardless of what other labels a clinical psychologist might use to describe him.

Yes, fair point.  If there were managers who explicitly gave their permission, or even turned a blind eye to this kind of behaviour happening ""at work"" then they are guilty of conspiracy to commit the crime.  However, it's important to draw the line between individuals who do wrong while working for the BBC, and the board of directors of the BBC sanctioning that kind of behaviour, i.e. individual vs corporate responsibility.

Even if there was a culture of turning a blind eye to the sexual antics of celebrities (something that was very much a sign of the times what with the 60s and 70s, free love, groupies, etc) it's hard to believe that the BBC would ever knowingly allow minors to be sexually abused by its staff. It's one thing for the BBC board of directors to know about and implicitly condone a bit of legal over-age hanky panky backstage (and I agree with those that say they *must* have known, if only because everyone was doing it), but a completely different thing for them to sanction criminal behaviour.",0,1350902018,null,0,false,0,c6q2svy,t3_11vyad,t1_c6q2svy,t1_c6q2lpa,null,1430210385,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

One thing i will say is Reina needs to re discover his form or we should look for a long term replacement. We've lost a lot of goals due to his mistakes and it has become a regular thing in the last year.

The thing is. We have good players and are playing well but not all these players are accustomed to a passing game. Rodgers will add add add passing technical players to the team and it will only get better from there. He's pretty much using the squad he inherited, with Allen his main signing for his philosophy and look at his performances. He's fantastic. Keeps possession, good passer, good interceptor.

What's the problem with this? It is open to the blatant manipulation of evidence in order to sell a product.

Setting aside what sort of head of state you have... it is generally accepted that the head of the government and the head of state should not be the same person.

The USA only sort of gets away with it thanks to being a federation of states with strong local powers which limits the authority of the Federal government.

In most other centralised governments, there has to be an independent power that can sack the head of the elected government in times of crisis.

There is also a diplomatic benefit in separating the work of governing from the ceremonial roles of State Visits.

I feel sorry for people in Scotland because without the answers to those questions, they really have no information to base their vote on.  Cameron and others play the same game of course, but are a little more subtle about it.

Really this whole thing should have started with Scotland, the rest of the UK, the EU and maybe even the UN sitting down and agreeing what an independent Scotland and it's people would get re:

UK national debt

Oil in the North Sea

Fishing rights

EU membership

Access to the rest of the UK for work and education (only partly covered by EU membership)

Rights and Obligations in treaty organisations (can Scotland be in Nato and if so how much would it need to contribute?, same for WTO, IMF, UN though this should be simple).

Continuation of rest of UK military presence - Do Scots want the British Armed forces to use bases and employ people in Scotland?  its a double edged sword...

If the numbers do include lots of individuals, they too could be said to be applying for lots of minor permissions that bump the stats up that were always likely to succeed (e.g. doing stuff to existing homes). Again, they aren't like to chance many wishful applications.

Finally, there does appear to be travellers out there that make a really good living buying cheap land with no chance of permission and then flogging on parcels of it to other travellers. Perhaps they are the ones that should be investigated?

true,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"&gt;Regarding the tax rate, [here](www.hmrc.gov.uk/budget2012/excheq-income-tax-2042.pdf) is an interesting report from HMRC that anticipated the reduction in the rate. You're right, insofar as they only had a full financial year to look back on regarding the tax, and the two years before in order to see how people anticipated it and adjusted their behaviour to minimise their exposure to it. However there is also a significant amount of data to draw on from the US and Europe, and the OECD, to suggest that the increased tax rate was damaging the economy. The report linked cites the substitution effect, where productivity in the labour market is reduced as people no longer see the payoff for additional work. It also cites the mobility of capital and individuals, and a reduction in foreign direct investment, as actual and potential side effects of the tax, noting that if the tax remained for a significant period it could account for up to 2.5% of GDP.

That report makes interesting reading, a few things that stood out for me were:
It makes no firm estimates of how much was raised; only saying it could be less than Â£1 billion
It points out that around Â£16 billion to Â£18 billion of income is estimated to have been brought forward to 2009-10 to avoid the introduction of the additional rate of tax. However this can only happen once. The report also points that there have been behaviourally responses due to the fact the tax is seen as temporary, which could have been different if it were seen as permanent.

Also I didn't realise this but according to the report a higher rate of capital gains tax of 28% was introduced at the same time as the 50% income tax rate was brought in. This makes sense as otherwise it would have encouraged people to shift their earnings to capital gains to avoid the tax. However this report tries to strip out the effect of this in order to estimate the yield of the top rate of tax in isolation. This seems a flawed idea, it should estimate the yield in reality not the yield that there might have been had capital gains tax not also been increased.

Compare it with [this report from the TUC]( http://www.tuc.org.uk/tucfiles/243/50percenttax.pdf). It also came out in March 2012 and uses the treasuries own figures to estimate that the take from the 50% tax rate could be up to Â£6 billion. Now you might say that the TUC is a left wing organisation so of course they are going to argue for a higher rate of tax. I would say that the represent public sector workers, so it is in their interest that the tax take is as high as possible. They would not want the tax rate to be higher if it did not result in a higher tax yield.

So what about the government â what do they want? They claim they want to raise as much tax as possible but I have another theory. What we have is a right wing government that inherited a high top rate of tax. If the higher top rate of tax was proved successful, it would be a disaster for the right. It would prove that the optimum rate of tax was higher than 40%, and that Maggie Thatcher as wrong to drop the top rate of tax from 60 to 40%. This is why I believe they were so keen to kill it. And they have succeeded â the first year the tax will have been largely avoided by people bringing their incomes forward by a year. The next year they just need to defer their incomes by a year. The tax will probably therefore raise little extra money and be used by those on the right to justify tax cuts for the rich for decades to come. Sorry if that makes me sound like a conspiracy theorist but you have to admit the Tories were always going to be politically opposed to the 50% tax rate regardless of the economics of it, and I donât think itâs inconceivable that the put pressure on the treasury to produce a report advocate a cut in the tax rate, which they had already decided they were going to do anyway.

As for corporation taxes I must admit I haven't had time to read that report so can't comment on it. The only thing I would say is that I would advocate a Europe wide, or even worldwide, minimum corporation tax rate. Otherwise yes corporations, being multinational, will try to outmanoeuvre national governments to avoid corporation tax and a race to the bottom will ensue. I would also point out that of course companies don't decide where to conduct business purely on the level of corporation tax in a country it is just one factor, they aren't going to miss out on a lucrative market due to the tax rate. Finally if corporation tax rates do have such a large effect on the economy, I would like to see evidence of how the current governments tax cuts have benefited our economy, which given that we are still in recession doesn't seem to have happened.

&gt;What you said about capital gains is interesting, and you're bang on about tax avoidance. The problem is, when big companies avoid tax the government is so over a barrel, as on one hand they want the money and don't want to appear a soft touch and establish a bad precedent, but on the other hand (let's use Starbucks as an example) companies can and do use their size and importance in local economies to get what they want out of governments. 8,500 jobs is a shitload of leverage, and omnishambles wouldn't even begin to describe the backlash if major companies took the nuclear option. Aon recently abandoned the US (for the UK in fact) due to tax issues, taking a shitload of jobs with them. They're fuckers, and it's like governments are riding monsters that they daren't dismount.

When companies threaten to leave because the government tries to force them to pay the tax they owe they are just empty threats. Yes they could pull out of the UK, but then they would lose all the profits they make in the UK. Alternatively they could stay in the UK and pay a percentage of their profits in tax. Clearly the latter is the better move; multinational companies are not going to cut off their nose to spite their face. They will of course use threats, lobbying, tax havens etc. to try to reduce the amount of tax they have to pay, but if we had a government with the courage to force them to pay the tax they owed they would have no choice but to fall in line.",0,1350905088,null,0,1350905405,0,c6q33m0,t3_11snbh,t1_c6q33m0,t1_c6poobz,null,1430210526,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

UK national debt is something that would have to be negotiated with Westminster, the only ""answer"" the SNP can provide is what they assume would be the case, unless Westminster also come out with something. 

Oil *should* be a settled question according to International law so that isn't really a question either, although I guess they could set it out in detail.

They need to set out something for EU membership in terms of continuation (into which fishing falls) but again that's not something that Scotland can decide unilaterally, it would need some input from the Commission. Personally it is enough for me that they have said they would pursue EU membership though, even if we didn't have it automatically (although as I have said above I have complete confidence we would be de facto members regardless, and negotiate from that position).

Schengen is similar and again would require input from others. It is probably the most problematic area unless Scotland can secure an opt-out or the rest of the UK also joins.

There isn't any questions with regards to international organisations, you'd have to look up the answers but criteria for membership and contributions are all set out for each of them.

There's no question that Scotland *can* use Sterling, the question is just whether it would have any say in monetary policy, or if they can set out a convincing case that it doesn't matter (I have heard several people say that such is the similarity between Scotland's economy and the rest of the UK that there aren't going to be any radical differences in needs for monetary policy a la the Euro for the foreseeable future anyway). That would again require Westminster input.

Armed forces is a policy decision isn't it? It's not really something independence is contingent on? As such I'd imagine the SNP would set out their position in their White Paper.

As for whether you can answer the question without ""knowing"" the answers to these - there's no way of ""knowing"" them for sure in the main, for me all I require is a sufficiently convincing argument, based in reality. Do we need to ""know"" if the UK will be in the EU by 2020 as well? Or the make up of the UK armed forces 20 years in the future?

Cesar - Solid, top top keeper, unfortunate for the OG. Some people complain he flaps or punches too much but that's just his style and he generally gets good distance on the ball. 7/10

Nelsen - Once again proving to be a great addition and just a shame he isn't 10 years younger, commanding and what he lacks in pace he makes up for in positional sense. Felt he could have done better with the header in the first half though, should have scored. 7/10

Mbia - I reckon once he settles in to the rhythm of the league he'll be an absolute weapon. Great composure, good on the ball, does like to go forwards alot (I realise he prefers to play as CDM) but was assured at the back, I'd like to see him do a bit better in the air too. 8/10

Bosingwa - Again, a reasonable performance, did well in keeping Baines and Pienaar reasonably quiet. Felt his crossing was poor this game though and communication with other defenders was an issue at times but that's a whole defense more than just a Bosingwa issue. 6/10

Traore - Hopefully he can get his fitness back because he makes such a difference than when we've had to put Hill at LB. His pace is such an asset and he links up so well with Taraabt down the left side. Arguably our best crosser of the ball too, just needs to work on positional play a bit more. 7/10

Park - Did a job this game without being spectacular, I think he does a lot of grunt work that people don't give him credit for and had some great sliding tackles but too many misplaced passes and spent too long on the ball a couple of times. 6/10

Granero - What a player this guy is, so assured on the ball and links up brilliantly with the rest of the midfield and the attack, his ability to turn with the ball in a tight area to get away from his man is incredible. Controlled the midfield and has a decent set piece on him, once settled he could be our best player this season and for me, joint man of the match 9/10

Diakite - Quiet first half, didn't really get involved much but changed it all around in the second. He has raw talent in abundance, the ability to glide past players is a beauty to watch just needs to lock down some consistency. Still he scares the bejeebus out of me everytime he goes in for a tackle, it's either a brilliant tackle or attempted murder. If he can keep that second half performance up he'll be a superstar. 7/10

Taarabt - Again, undoubted talent in this guy and was shown in the first half, everytime he gets the ball he is so unpredictable, long pass, short pass, trick, shot, you never know what he'll do. His link up play has improved by worlds and him and Traore had a fantastic understanding down the left side this game. Was fairly anonymous in the second half though, again, needs to get involved a bit more. 8/10

Zamora - A workhorse performance albeit a slightly disappointing one. Defensively he was absolutely woeful and at fault for the goal conceded. For me he didn't win enough in the air either. Everton looked to have 2 people on him at most times which made it difficult for him but he should be doing a bit better. Couple of poor decisions and some of his passing needs to be a bit crisper but I'd keep him in the team to try and bully Arsenal's defense next week. 6/10

Hoilett - Hasn't been given enough of a chance this year for me but proved his worth this game. He was just all energy, running forward, tracking back. Great ability to cut inside players and shoot and was only denied a couple more goals from some great saves from Howard, I like him in that front roll working off Zamora and if he can keep the same energy levels and work on his final product a bit will score a hatful this year.

My reasoning behind reducing the width of the lanes for *cars* is to reduce the maximum comfortable navigable speed. If you look at a motorway lane, it's about 2.5x the width of a standard car, as roads slow down, lanes become narrower. 

By narrowing the lanes, it allows rights of way to be constructed on the verge of the road for cicylists. In an ideal world, I'd like to to see the mentality shift to pavements increasing in width, and then modifying a part of them for cyclists, rather than have cyclist on the road proper, with their own painted lane. This means kerb delineated where possible, followed by raised chevrons, followed by tighty-packed cats-eyes, followed by paint, followed by the open road in the worst case.

As for (shallow) chicanes, they are more for the comfort of pedestrians. Motorist will tend to speed up on straight roads, which is both loud and unsafe.

&gt;Long term profit vs short term profit. Drug companies report to their investors quarterly, meaning they are no longer in it to save/improve lives but to appease the will of the rich

How to you make that assumption then? Reporting to investors on a quarterly basis is usual practice for a big business, as I understand it. You are implying that a big business should be doing things on a moral basis only. Not every single person that works in that pharma company will be there because they want to save/improve lives, just like not everyone who works in a bank wants to save their customers money. 

&gt;Even taking the hypothetical stance that a drug might cost Â£3billion in failed projects to create, they aren't attempting to earn that Â£3b back over 30-40 years of the NHS. They're trying to get that back in a single year from global usage.

I am not sure I follow that line of thinking, they need to maximise profits from the sale of their drug, this is to cover the costs of research and manufacture and to bring in a steady turnover that goes back into the investors and back into the company for more research. That is how businesses work.

&gt;Once they break even, do they slash the prices out of goodwill? I very much doubt it, next year they will try and earn another Â£3billion.

I am still not sure where you get this idea of a year from, but going with what you said why on earth should they do it out of goodwill? You are making assumptions that big business should run on morals, it just isn't how it works. The sooner people realise this, and regard pharmas like any other business, the sooner we can get rid of the 'pharmas are eveil' mantra that filters through the net.

They are ensconced. Just like it was scouting for (only) boys. Just like it was scouting for (mostly) Christians. Just like so many other aspects that have had to alter and change over the century. This is no different. 

And it is about numbers. I was a leader of a beaver unit that shut down because there simply were not enough kids to maintain it. Everything about scouting and the potential success of any given group is fundamentally about how many members it has. To think anything else is naive.

He is getting beaten on by the media because they loved Harry, who lived in the media and who's actions with the media was demonstrated last season when the team took 3 months off because Harry was playing maybe/maybe not over the England job.

Fact is we are 8 games into the season so it is very early....Arsenal is in 9th, Newcastle is in 11th....both of them have enough talent to be much higher and by the end of the season they will be.  Everton, Ham, and Brom are off to good starts...Everton will fade as usual because defense is great but at some point you have to score goals, Brom will slide because as good a coach as Steve Clarke looks to be they just don't have the talent for a long season, same can be said for Ham.  Aresenal will move up, Newcastle will move up, Fulham, Stoke, Swansea, Liverpool will all settle in the 7-12 range.

There are **30** more games this season, that is a hell of alot of season left to go....remember last year around this time people were saying Stoke could compete for a CL slot because they got off to a good start, they ended up in 14th....24 points behind us.

We have some issues....Gallas being too far gone, the defense in general, but we can stabalize and climb the table as the rest of the teams start to fade just like we have the past 3 seasons.

[*Edit:* I am a member of staff at the University but not directly involved with admissions. The comments below are a personal opinion based on previous experience and personal discussion with colleagues in admissions and should not be taken as gospel.]

Your chances are based on your ability, aptitude and possessing the prerequisite knowledge for the course. Forcing yourself to do Further Maths affects none of the first two. Looking at http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/economics/ it would appear that Further Mathematics is not a requirement and so dropping it should not affect the prerequisite knowledge you will be expected to have.

The admissions process at Cambridge is one of the most open and fair ones that I know of with extraordinary effort being expended to make sure that each applicant is evaluated on their individual merits.

Undoubtedly the best way to address your worries is to have a representative from a Cambridge college come to your school. See, e.g., http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/teachers/wp.html for the University-wide page on this. If you have a particular college in mind, Googling ""Schools Liaison Officer"" plus that college will give you the contact detail for the person at that college whose job it is to go to schools and give them information on admissions and answer questions such as you have.

SLOs have an informal 'catchment area' system as well for some schools and so even if the SLO for your college of choice cannot come to your school they should be able to direct you to the SLO who has informal responsibility for your area.

A SLO visit is free to the school and is not directed primarily at applicants for a particular college.

&gt; Also, on a side note, what are you tips/advice in general?

[**Edit:** I forgot the most important bit of advice: apply. The chief problem with Oxbridge is that applications are biased away from people who have decided *by themselves* that they have no chance with no evidence beyond hearsay and prejudice. The best way to find out is to apply. It costs nothing apart from time.]

Studying an academic subject at university level is done primarily for the love of the subject itself. Or, at least, this is the axiom which I suggest you adopt for Cambridge. You will get nothing out of Cambridge unless you have a genuine enthusiasm for your chosen subject.

My advice would be to explain to someone else why you love Economics. What fascinates you about it? What is your favourite aspect? Take that aspect and teach someone else about it. If you have a passion for a subject, that should come across when you talk about it.

My 'tip' is therefore to find someone you can talk to about why you want to be an Economist. That person should challenge your viewpoint, ask for clarification if they don't understand and require basic Economic facts/principles explained to them. If you can make them understand why you love Economics, you're prepared.

Also note that 'enthusiasm for...' is not the same as 'encyclopÃ¦dic knowledge of...'. You're coming to the University to learn, not to lecture. Your interviewer does not care beyond a certain level about what you know or what you can do.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I don't think dropping Further Maths is necessarily a killer, but you would definitely need to be ready if they ask you why you didn't continue with it.

I'm with /u/digable-me about the number of A-levels - unless it's compulsory at your school, you should probably drop Critical Thinking, as it will be absolutely no use to you in application. Physics is probably the least relevant to Economics, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

Really the best advice I can give you about which A-levels to drop is that you should consider what kind of workload you can support - many if not most people at Cambridge only did three A-levels. If you want to do more, great, but be sure that you can get a good mark in all of them - there's no point in doing six A-levels and getting all Bs, or even doing four and getting 3 A*s and a C.

To be honest, your subject choices probably matter less than you think they do - you're doing Economics already, so as long as you're not doing things like Drama or Media Studies, the university will be interested. You need to show that you can think on your own - they don't really care about _what you know_, much more about _how you approach unfamiliar problems_. Take it from me - you'll be approaching a lot more unfamiliar problems at Cambridge than you will be reciting facts.

As far as the interview goes - don't try and rely on stock answers, don't be afraid to think out loud, and don't say things you don't understand.

true,pikeybastard,null,null,"Oh definitely, the government had to kill 50% this year either way, whether it was damaging the economy or not merely to kill the idea. And you're right, too, about there being no long term data as to the effects; both hmrc's and the tuc's claims are built upon projections that are hostage to fortune. I'm not sure about their report being subject to  'pressure' as it is a non-ministerial department, and their estimates are derived from the experience of other countries who instigated such taxes. But then, as you note, they weren't clear in their picture of how behaviour would change were this an acknowledged permanent feature in the tax landscape. What this seems to all show is that the last government shot blind when introducing it, and the current government has shot blind in getting rid of it, and it is pure politics. 

The corporation tax thing again I am in complete agreement with you. What currently happens is pure game theory between states as they try to gain an incremental advantage and attract business and foreign direct investors. The solution would be a concerted approach, but the problem here is that anybody outside of that group would instantly gain a killer advantage. If the eu were to do this then companies would move to outside the eu, etc. it's a bugger!

When companies threaten to up sticks it isn't always an empty threat, however of course often it is. Yes, of course Starbucks will want to carry on making money in the uk, however that being said it isn't always a choice between leaving totally or not at all. For example, look at all the companies operating in the uk who are actually based in Ireland. They have some people working in this country, but many of the jobs that were here, or could have been here, are in Dublin instead. But yes, particularly with service jobs you are right, much of it is bluff, as its within starbuck's interests to keep selling coffee!

That being said, just as it was too soon to judge much of the impact of the 24% tax rate, it's too early to judge whether the changes instigated are helping or hindering the economy. The next two quarters will give a better indication. Also, and I don't like parroting the government's line here as it is a great way of absolving responsibility, it's hard to see how anybody could have avoided a double dip when the euro zone has shrunk again and the US, our second biggest trading partner and largest foreign investor, is currently thought to have dipped in. So again, it's a bit early to tell whether it was our beloved  gideon's budget or events strangling recovery. My own take is that both sides are hyping up the effectiveness of their respective strategies over the economy, and don't want to admit that they're far less in control of any recovery than they'd want us to know.

Interesting chat btw, a pleasure, the tuc report was good. If you get the chance the OECD is dry as hell but is good for a big- picture view!
