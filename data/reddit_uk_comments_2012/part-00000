true,czerniana,eccleston,Eccleston,"Well, to be fair i only lived in Florida about a year total.  Germany was the big thing.  I lived in the country for eight years or so, just in different places.  And not N.Florida no.  It was Homestead.  What my mom calls 'the little Cuba south of Miami'  xD  

yes, it is hard on relationships and friendships.  I am basically a social retard.  I have had one best friend my whole life, and she tore my heart out of my chest and ate it for dinner.  Not exactly looking to fill that position anytime soon.  I have problems letting people in, but i have bigger problems meeting people in the first place.   I was married, which is how i ended up in california and nebraska, and then when i got divorced i had to move in with my mom who had moved to s.carolina.  I don't plan on staying here no.  I'm thinking of moving to the Chicago area, though i'm not sure.  I have friends that i met at a convention that live up there and it would be great to move somewhere i know people.   Either way, i don't have anything keeping me here.   

Thank the gods for Reddit.

Where's your mom from?  While i agree that some things are... i dunno what the word is... more abundant here, i just don't think quality of life will sustain much longer.  And frankly, i don't like having to break my back at a job i hate for a meager living.  Not retail at least.  If i had my own farm, okay, i could see it.  But there is zero satisfaction in going home at the end of a long day of selling cheap sweat shop made shit.  I might can fool myself sometimes like today, but it was because i actually did something at work and not because i handled customers.  (re-organized some shit that needed it badly)  I dunno.  I am frustrated.  I want a simpler life is all, and you can't achieve that here.  Or it is very difficult and usually requires waiting till retirement.

In addition she has saved Rory's life a few times such as in the Wedding of River Song and Vampires in Venice. As for Amy treating Rory poorly I think its excusable given the circumstances, she obviously has issues from her childhood since she had no parents and the doctor abandoned her, and then the Doctor, who she has romanticized though out her life, comes back the night before her wedding offering her all of time and space, this mixed with the typical hesitation people get before getting married I think justifies Amy's actions. In contrast Rose left her boyfriend (although she was in a less serious relationship) after meeting the doctor a few days earlier and being told and shown that being around him is dangerous, in addition the Doctor is kind of a jerk to her at first. I also don't think River is a Mary Sue but I could see why some one may see it that way but I think she does have legitimate flaws and its not like shes constantly being praised by everyone (in fact considering the main cast consists of her lover and her parents I would expect that they would be more supportive/focused on her). I can see why you might be bothered by how flirtatious River is with the Doctor but I think that just comes down to how sexual you think the doctor should be and how explicit the doctors sexuality should be.

But where I was coming from was trying to put myself in the writers' (read: show runner's) place: first, based on the role the regular companions seemed to fulfill to me in the first six years and, second, how I don't see that formula changing because it helps the show appeal to a broader audience. 

When you say we don't need them to be an audience surrogate anymore, that's coming from someone who has been watching this whole time. To me, that's a more involved fan. But a show stays popular by keeping the more casual fan involved. And with Doctor Who, I think one way to keep itself accessible is to continue to have an audience surrogate. It's kind of like wish fulfillment--give the audience someway to picture itself as part of the story, and it will keep coming back for more. 

As much as I really enjoyed The Lodger and Closing Time, I can't help but think how many of the typical male Doctor Who fans saw a bit of themselves in Craig. That's like blatant wish fulfillment. The regular companions are generally female because they need to fulfill more than just the male audience surrogate role, but that feeling is still important to address in order to maintain broad appeal. I think the biggest change of pace you're going to get as a companion these days is another Donna.

It was this sort of thinking that lead to the big debate surrounding whether Susan was really the Doctor's biological granddaughter, which eventually worked its way into causing scripting problems for *The Five Doctors*. It was a pointless debate then, and it is a pointless debate now.

I'll be on record as saying that I was very uncomfortable with the Doctor/Rose romance through Series 2, but that had a great deal more to do with the 'cute and insular' nature of the relationship than the sexual connotations. I never truly understood what made Rose so special in the Doctor's eyes, especially given the sheer number of very similar companions he has had over his lifetime. The fact that we spent 4 seasons covering the impact Rose had on the Doctor made it all the more intolerable, especially since it effectively prevented Martha from being anything but a rebound from the 'Amazing Rose'. It was as if I was being *told* what a wonderful character Rose was, but what I was seeing was a very average companion being given unwarranted special treatment by a man who has dealt with these sorts of things in the past. The fact that they had to completely retcon Sarah-Jane's character to drive the point home made it all the more irritating.

I think the difference between the Ten/Rose and the Eleven/River romances is the manner in which they developed. With Ten/Rose, up until Series 2 I had always taken the Doctor to be more of a paternal figure for Rose, who had grown up without a father. However, with *The Parting of the Ways* onwards, the relationship took a sharp turn into 'cute couple' territory, with little period of adjustment. Whether it was just the way Tennant played the Doctor, or how it was written, the dynamic of the two leads was considerably changed from the Nine/Rose partnership. *The Girl in the Fireplace* feels very out-of-place for this exact reason, as Moffat was still working under the dynamic set up in Series 1, which resulted in the bizarre sequence of the Doctor flirting with another women that wouldn't be seen again until Series 5. With River, the backwards-nature of the relationship saw a distinct period of adjustment for the Doctor. We see how the Doctor gradually comes to trust River over the course of Series 5, after having witnessed her death in Series 4. By the time we get to Series 6, the Doctor is openly flirting in a manner that we hadn't seen since Series 1/2.03. River herself has gone through a very unusual period of character development, as the wibbly-wobbly nature of her life means that her development was quite literally all over the place. However, as the *First/Last Night* shorts demonstrate, she does have a linear character growth (with flaws that aren't directly related to the Silence tampering) and for once it *doesn't* revolve around her being involved in a plot device unrelated to her character development that makes her 'The Most Important Person EVAR!!!!' that we've been forced to sit through for the previous 4 companions. 

The problem with having every companion being 'The Most Important Person EVAR!!!!' is that the nature of what made them important is hardly ever linked to the development of the character over the season. With Rose, what made her important in Series 1 was not that she had developed as a person through having travelled the Doctor, but that she became MagicGod!Rose through staring at a plot device. Martha's 'travelling the earth' was even less believable, given that her character had been so poorly characterised and overshadowed throughout the series that her ability to spread the word of the Doctor became just another irrelevant aspect of a character that had no defining features, save for occasionally moaning about how the Doctor doesn't 'wuv' her. Donna's 'important' moment was equally pointless, as the whole stupid 'DoctorDonna' moment on the Crucible focused not on how much she has grown as a person, but on how much cleverer she is now she has the Doctor's brain thanks to whatever mindless technobabble RTD decided would justify the plot device. Despite all the pointless foreshadowing about how Donna is the most 'important woman in all creation', the heartbreaking moment is sad *not* because of her brief stint as the DoctorDonna, but how she had become a better person after travelling with the Doctor. Likewise with Amy, Moffat fell into the trap that RTD had set up, and thus made Amy another pointless 'Universe Saviour' through something that was once again almost entirely irrelevant to her development as a character. There seemed to be an attempt at having the plot device (her time-crack altered mind) actually affect her character growth through it absorbing her loved ones (Parents, Rory, etc.) but it still came across as rather pointless and contrived. Whoever takes over after the Ponds, I really hope we can have a season without all the 'Most Important Person EVAR!!!!' business being used as a substitute for real character development.

With Jenny, I don't think Moffat specifically asked for her to survive, but simply pointed out that having the beautiful blonde girl sacrifice herself to save the day was silly and overdone; having her magically survive and fly off into the sky was probably not what he had in mind. But yes, her character was awful and I sincerely hope she never appears again.

Vet techs see animals under a lot of stress the majority of the time i'd say, so it's fairly common to not see the actual personality of the pet.  It depends on the facility as to how stressed the animal is or not.   some facilities are more inviting than others, and some things stress out animals that we have no control over.  Just the facts of life =P

yeah, I could not do your moms job. I would be so disheartened with the system when i came home that i just wouldn't be able to take it.  I thought about volunteering at the literacy council for a while there, but i just don't know if i can do it.  More because i can't understand about a fourth of the people here due to either their mumble or their inability to enunciate their words.  I literally had a lady in to work yesterday that had such a thick mumbly southern hicky accent i think i only recognized one word per sentence.  I had to just laugh when it seemed it was appropriate, and get her through the line.  I was shocked.

My cat is vicious at the vet. One place put her in a push cage and it broke my heart. She doesn't have front claws and the only time she bites is when she's hungry, she nibbles my toes. But even if someone gets too close to her she won't bite. Any facility. All of them. I've taken her to a few different places (since I was moving) and she acts like that every time. Poor little kitty.

Volunteering with literacy sounds like something I would love. I just took my first teaching reading course. It was great. Really, really hard, but great. But people need to learn how to read and write, even simple things. I cannot figure out why these last chance schools don't have programs that will help these kids in day to day life. Like how to properly write a resume, or fill out an application. These are things that people need to get by in life. If they can't do it, how are they supposed to contribute to society?

Personally, i want to think that the rapidly declining education system in the US will someday cripple our society and facilitate change.  The reality is however that that change will likely come not for education but for other things.  The Occupy Movement is fighting for government change, but even if the government were changed today to cut out all corporate problems there will be no changes in the education system.  People shout calls for education reform, but the system doesn't need to be reformed it needs thrown out the window and replaced with a completely different and completely sparkly new system.  Nothing seems to work right now.  There have always been uneducated people, those that just don't get it.  I think the problem is now that there are lot of undereducated people that could get it.  As that number grows up their frustrations will continue to boil until it breaks.  It frightens me for my future.  It may be a very cynical way to think of it, but i don't see how this country will continue to govern itself the way that it has been for many generations longer.  Change may not occur in my lifetime, but eventually this government will have to either change, or separate into smaller more manageable areas to govern.

THANK YOU. This has bothered me during the entire season. It's so shitty and unrealistic. Amy wasn't my least favorite companion by far, but I agree that her and Rory have had their stories told. (Well, actually, Rory can stay. I'm just sick of Amy.)

true,Lopretni,eccleston,Eccleston,"I've always thought, based on The Three Doctors, that Time Lords have their own time stream, totally separate from everything else, both in relation to the rest of the universe and how exactly their time streams function. In essence, they have a truly linear time stream, whereas everything else in the universe is totally chaotic. This explains the idea of them being 'guardians' of time. They are immune to its most adverse effects. This leads to a level of responsibility, as they cannot alter their past, and the past of those who they interact with, once set in stone.

The Fifth Doctor, in the Five Doctors, is the latest Doctor in existence due to how Time Lord time streams work, and is only working off knowledge in his time stream. When he interferes with the past, he is in essence creating a new time stream of himself that now knows things. But the current Doctor remains the dominant force, so nothing is really changed. If the Eleventh Doctor, say, wanted to go back in time and prevent Rose from her eventual fate for whatever reason, he couldn't. Because his timestream would remain the same, and so would that entire event because his own time stream ""locks"" everything about that event in place. 

dfjldkjdflafjdalfdja

It's really confusing but it makes sense in my head. The general idea is that Time Lords themselves are immune to paradoxes and things and wherever they go, time remains set in stone based purely upon their own actions. This doesn't mean that if, say, the Master went back in time to ensure that Hitler won WWII another Time Lord couldn't go and change it themselves. It just means that if the previous three incarnations did it, the Simms/modern Master couldn't change it because his time stream is set in stone, and he cannot alter his own past. 

Which in a way contradicts my previous idea that a Time Lord's intervention locks a stream in place. It could be something of a window of time where the time stream for that event is still malleable and vulnerable. But once he leaves, that's it. Again, Time Lords working off completely different time streams. The beginning and the end of the universe have already happened, and yet, the Eleventh Doctor still has yet to regenerate. Which means it took some incredible trickery for the Valeyard to get where he did during the Sixth Doctor's era.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"Firstly, I think one of the major problems has been the way forensic investigation and evidence has been increasingly presented in crime programmes on television, which set up unrealistic expectations in juries which can in certain circumstances tip the balance in either direction, almost regardless of the quality of the prosecution evidence - i.e., in some circumstances they may lead to a jury feeling the evidence isn't as whizz bang definitive as Bones or CSI led them to expect so they perceive a case as weaker than it is, alternatively, they may have unreasonable faith in the superhuman lab geeks they hero-worship every week on TV.

Forensic science is a wide and diverse field and not all elements of it are equally reliable or valid.  Some were clearly not as reliable/valid as they were alleged to be at the time that they resulted in convictions (a few good examples of this would be in the field of [arson/fire investigation in the US](http://www.thetruthaboutforensicscience.com/fire-whisperes-the-story-of-bad-arson-investigation/), psychological/offender profiling and ESDA tests in the UK which missed crucial falsification of confessions in the Cardiff 3 case initially).  But even [fingerprints and DNA are far from foolproof](http://www.fdu.edu/newspubs/magazine/10ws/forensics.html).  [Popular Mechanics also has an interesting article on some of the issues](http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/forensics/4325774).

There's also the key issue of how forensic evidence has historically been handled in court in an adversarial system with prosecution and defence calling contradictory testimony from expert witnesses, one of whom may approach things from a sensibly scientific probabilistic point of view, whilst the other may introduce evidence as if he were 100% certain of it which can carry undue weight with a jury.

true,Faustyna,river,River,"That is dying. Dying and becoming an entirely new person. 10 had the unique experience of almost being too close to his companions. He regenerated from 9 into a man that Rose could love- and he loved her as well. Enough that a perfect duplicate of him stayed in another universe with her. With Martha he missed Rose, and Donna was a good friend to help him move through being love-sick.

As a 'human' falling in love and knowing what his life could be in The Family of Blood, and then returning to being The Doctor- I would imagine it would bring back an ache for Rose and knowledge that it's highly likely his alternate-universe self is doing exactly that. Being able to live a 'stable' life, married to Rose and have a family. While, side-canonically, traveling about with an alternate TARDIS as well.

So in his last moments, when this personality and being that was at it's heart made for Rose, is dying... he doesn't want to go. He was made from love of another, for love of another. Even with Rose gone his essence is still that of a man who wants to protect and shield and do good. He fights as any husband and father might for whatever wife or children he has- the universe and the humans of earth who he loves.

But he dies. And regenerates as a new man- a man that knows love, but more as an observer than someone who feels it. An admirer from afar. So by all means he is affectionate and lovely and amazing- he makes a best friend very quickly. But he's confused by great affection, awkward around it, more often depicted as casually cruel (his comment about Angel Bob being dead, his speech in the WWII Dalek episode was one of pain and not joy).

He knows humans love, and that love can bring about many a great things (Stormageddon and his dad, Rory the Centurion) but he has to trust himself to love again. Because he is The Doctor, and those great things that men do for love may turn into dark and terrible things when in the hands of a Time Lord.

Over the course of the last two seasons, culminating in the Christmas Special, he's fallen back into a pattern of love- but still one that's fatherly and a step to the side. Amusingly of course, because he's fatherly to his mother-in-law.

EDIT: The above is written out with the help of reading r/doctorwho too much, learning about other's theories (what mainly comes to mind is that 10 was made 'for Rose' as something I believe I read here) and applying some of my own thought.

I think all these answers are valid. By it's very nature, the Time War is literally incredible. I suspect whole timelines and alternate universes were the kinds of things they fought over. Whole civilizations made and unmade and remade in the course of one battle, whole worlds ripped apart, made into weapons. And as Doctor Who has frequently shown, there was 'magic' as well. Beings and weapons made of pure willpower (See: Omega), concepts, ideas and fiction coming to life (See: The Land of Fiction and the Weeping Angels). Total annihilation of space and time itself at stake (See: The Reality Bomb, the ""heat death"" of Logopolis, etc.). And it was bad enough that, according to RTD, the Eternals (the Guardians etc. from the Fourth/Fifth Doctor era) chose to 'leave this reality' altogether.

And the Doctor stopped it. The core mystery of the question ""Doctor Who?"", and things like the Cartmel Masterplan, are about his beginnings. But this is something equally mysterious.. the Doctor destroyed the Time Lords. Not only destroyed them, but completely removed them, forever. That probably makes him the most powerful being in the Doctor Who universe (which is of course by definition true, since it's.. his universe.. The Doctor, in the end, is the single character that this show cares about and everything only 'exists' because of him in a weird meta kind of way).

I like to think that somehow, the Doctor also created the Time Lords. He was there (or will be there?) at the beginning, and he was or will be there at the end. He might not even know it himself (yet? or he has just 'forgotten'), but in my view, he's not just a renegade Time Lord, but the alpha and omega of the universe. And also a bit like Tom Bombadil perhaps, out of place and unknowable.

Which is why Moffat's First Question must not and cannot ever be answered. The answer to ""Doctor Who"" would end the show, and therefore the whole DW universe.",0,1325419090,null,0,false,0,c3cxyc8,t3_nygt5,t1_c3cxyc8,t3_nygt5,null,1428106476,24,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,24

1. Time Lords start existing and learn to control time.

3. Daleks and Time Lords fight through space and time.
4. The final battle takes both species, removes them from all time and space and locks them in a bubble.

Despite them being removed from time and space at a certain point (which because of time travel could've been at any time and all time), the people who were alive still remember the events that happened before the time lock. Even if those events no longer happened in the current timeline.

So people remember that there once were Time Lords and Daleks, who from their perspective one day suddenly didn't exist anymore. Their stories where then spread as legends and myths. The time war was fought across all time and therefore pretty much everyone at anytime can remember parts of it. It was  a war that affected and threatened to destroy the whole of time and space after all.

What would an experienced interviewer draw from me saying no comment? What use is his opinion? He can't put 'exhibit A' tags on it. 

If I was guilty, I might make a statement after talking with my brief but I am not a serial killer, I'm not guilty and I'd say nothing. They'd need evidence to charge me so I'd be walking out of there, I'll leave it to others to play truth or dare with a a lie detector voodoo doctor!

I'll link a video here. The first half is a US law professor explaining why talking to the police is bad at all times and the second is an investigator agreeing with him. Innocent people get themselves charged all the time due to what they say. I changed my mind by 180 degrees when I first saw it.

Ironically, the nearest I ever got to having a disagreement over NI politics occurred not there or in the Republic, but on the Isle of Man – where I was working alongside a bunch of contractors from Ballymena. I neither knew nor cared which side of the NI community they were from… that is until the day I made the mistake of casually referring to them as ""you Irish boys"". They let me know, in a very angry manner reminiscent of Ian Paisley, that they were **BRITISH!** Of course, being the argumentative idiot that I am, I had to ask whether they might not consider themselves as both; pointing out that, regardless of politics, they were *geographically* from part of the island of Ireland. For some reason this seemed to outrage them even more – one of them in particular was almost apoplectic! :&amp;#94;o – so I quickly backed down promising never to refer to them as Irish again.

no

Long answer:
Lets think about his numbers for a second.  He's 27, so he definitely isn't that young, although he probably has a few more good seasons in him.  That being said, I feel like he is probably reaching (roughly) the peak of his playing career.  He relies on his speed and mobility to score.  Aging is going to reduce the effectiveness of both of these attributes.  These play a large role in his ability to position himself to score since he isn't a big, physical striker a la Heskey.

Yes, he has consistently been in the top 5 or 6 top goal scorers in the prem for the past few few seasons, but I still don't think a 24 mil price tag can be justified when there are similar rumors about Arsenal making a 10 mil bid for a player like Podolski.  Even someone like Clint Dempsey could be had for significantly less and also provide a bit more utility in terms of positions he could play while still scoring consistently.

I think part of what I don't like about this is our obsession with ""buying British,"" so that may be making me a bit biased.  Don't get me wrong, I agree with all of our pick ups in the summer and think we have built up a solid spine of (young) British talent, but I don't think we should constantly shell out the premium for British players, especially for ones that aren't particularly young.

Honestly, Kuyt was alright as a right forward player in Rafa's 4-2-3-1. But Kenny's desire to play him as a right mid in a 4-4-2 means that his positioning and other skills are wasted, all we get to see of him is his ""work rate"", and it has been showing in performances much worse than last year when he partnered Suarez atop a 3-5-2.",0,1325437851,null,0,false,0,c3cz5l7,t3_nyk1z,t1_c3cz5l7,t1_c3cye2k,null,1428107118,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

He reckoned women are attractive to heterosexual men regardless of whether they're witty or not, but men have so little else in their arsenal to appeal to women that we [men] have *had* to develop to be more funny than they are. Perhaps, if there is a grain of truth in this – and I'm not saying there is – it is instinctively considered a man's role to be funny, so women who are funny are seen as too male-like?

true,FTR,null,null,"Actually, that statement was contradictory.  Suarez and Liverpool staff said it in different ways, so the statement itself that you have highlighted was, in itself, contradictory.  Also, ""South American"" is not an offensive term anywhere.  Negro is, and specifically, in England.  As the report states, by acting as if Suarez is responding to the term ""South American,"" it undermines Suarez's comments that Negro was not used offensively.  

Total failure on Liverpool's part.

&gt;Dalglish told the referee that Suarez responded with “you are black” having first been taunted with “you are South American”. Comolli is not recorded as using the word “taunted”, but said that Evra said “you are South American” to Suarez who responded with “Tues negro” which translates “you are Black”. There is no suggestion here that Evra had said “Don’t touch me”, yet this seems now to be an essential part of Suarez’s evidence. We were not given any explanation as to why the referee was not told that Evra had said “Don’t touch me, South American”, as opposed to “you are South American”. Secondly, at least as expressly reported by Dalglish, Suarez’s remark was a riposte to being taunted by Evra. If that is correct, it would suggest that Dalglish understood Mr Suarez’s comment to be in the nature of retaliation for having been called “South American”. But that would suggest that the riposte “You are black” was used in a derogatory sense, which is contrary to Suarez’s case. In fact, Suarez told us that he did not consider being described as South American to be derogatory, so it is difficult to understand why this was referred to as a “taunt”.

If possible, if she will let you, go onto the Dr's room with her, just as back up, so if you feel she isn't being listened to you can step in and redivert the conversation, especially if she gets upset, bless her.  Get her to write a list of things down that are bothering her, including a chronological order of how they started. It is important the Doctor knows all of her symptoms, even if they appear minor because they can help her be diagnosed. 

Is she needle phobic at all? Because the doctor may well want her to book another appointment for a blood test, it is better to be prepare for something like that than to be confronted with it. 

The most important thing to get through to her, and show her this thread if it helps is that she is **important**, and what she is going through is not her imagination, it is real and needs to be investigated.

If I were to analyse the comment, I would say I intended it primarily as a remark about the repetitive nature of posts on Reddit, and the depressing picture painted by their popularity. I imagined the reference to 'female redditors' to include the unknown number who read, liked, were influenced by, or upvoted the article. I think that attributing the reference only to the poster is an unusually narrow interpretation. 

The comment probably implicitly hinted at a general distaste for this type of article. This was not really the intention - indeed I think it was only the word 'endless' that implied it - but since I'm explaining myself I'll come clean and say that I do indeed tend to dislike this type of article. I think it's lazy, pageview-generation journalism, and I don't think they ever did anybody in the world any good. And as such I dislike this type of article increasing its reach (in this case by flipping the genders). 

As is common on Reddit, if one spots a limitation or flaw in an article, one comments on it. I wished to suggest that this piece a mere equivalent (i.e. was no more valid than) the women-dislike-[x]-guys posts so commonly seen, and should be regarded as such. It seemed like a reasonable thing to say. Clearly, Reddit disagrees.

I have a friend who would never hit anyone, and people see it and so on nights out he's always having strangers fuck with him eg. steal his food, spit on him, push him, randomly go up to him and punch him, steal his phone (he had 8 stolen in a year).

My daughter, who is a radiographer, had said they will send you for a scan. They didn't.  Literally hundreds of antibiotics later (they were costing me £30 a week for at least a month and doing nothing), and still fobbing me off.    
  
My leg was like an upside down bowling skittle.  I could no longer walk properly and STILL this young woman dosed out more anti-biotics.  I took matters into my own hands and went to the hospital.  By then my leg was so huge and I was in excrutiating pain but they couldn't see anything on a scan it was so swollen.  So I self-prescribed total bed rest to get the swelling down, turned up at the hospital for a scan while it was less swollen.  Ultra-sound, instant diagnosis, blood clot.  I walked around with that for around 8 weeks because they put my life in the hands of unqualified medical personnel.  I'm actually lucky to be alive.  I ended up having to inject myself in the stomach on a daily basis and then attend a Warfarin (don't go there, they all think it's a day out) Clinic.

Yes, there was a second opinion.  The doctor giving the second opinion, however, never actually bothered to examine me.  That was my only experience with my GP in six years.  I would trust their diagnosis like I would trust David Cameron.  
  
Also, had I trusted my Doctor, my son, who was a babe in arms at the time, would not be alive today.  This doctor was old at the time.  My son is now 21.  I recently found out this Doctor is still practicing as a locum.   This is worrying.  
 
GPs are not infallible.  In fact they can be bloody minded luddites.  I would get a second opinion asap.  A good way of doing this is to call the practice and ask what days the doctor you don't want to see is available.  They will list the days, and also says which days they don't work.  Ring back ten minutes later and ask for an appointment on the day they don't work.

Three points to remember:

1) Doctor Who is television. Most things you see on television, including/especially news and reality shows, are not supposed to be factually/scientifically accurate. 

2) Doctor Who is science fiction. With notable exceptions, science fiction inherently bends/breaks the rules more than most other mediums, with realistic science added only where it aids the story telling. So in most sci-fi, time travel and faster than light travel are possible and ordinary, but gravity is only an issue when it suits a plot device, like black holes and spacewalks. 

3) Doctor Who is written for younger audiences. Yes, it's a kids show. No need for exquisite detail. It's more realistic than ""iCarly"" and ""Power Rangers"" but generally, the bar is pretty low. 

Doctor Who is a children's science fiction television show. Combining all above factors, you get the second lowest standard of realism in any medium. The only thing that should be less realistic by design is cartoons and puppet shows. Oh, and porn.

true,Variola13,null,null,"&gt;I have to say I found this reply extremely defensive. My comment was offhand and not worthy of analysis. However, I have lots of spare time today so will follow it up.

As pointless and unhelpful as I found your comment? 

The fact you have to say you feel you have to justify following it up is telling. 

&gt;If I were to analyse the comment, I would say I intended it primarily as a remark about the repetitive nature of posts on Reddit, and the depressing picture painted by their popularity. I imagined the reference to 'female redditors' to include the unknown number who read, liked, were influenced by, or upvoted the article. I think that attributing the reference only to the poster is an unusually narrow interpretation.

This is Reddit, a picture of a cute dog will get more upvotes than a well constructed blog about politics or society in general. The perceived 'worthiness' of an article does not have a causal relationship with popularity, its just how it is on here. *shrugs*.

&gt;The comment probably implicitly hinted at a general distaste for this type of article. This was not really the intention - indeed I think it was only the word 'endless' that implied it - but since I'm explaining myself I'll come clean and say that I do indeed tend to dislike this type of article. I think it's lazy, pageview-generation journalism, and I don't think they ever did anybody in the world any good. And as such I dislike this type of article increasing its reach (in this case by flipping the genders).

I actually think it generated some good discussion, the article itself raised a few interesting points regarding how men view female jokers. It wasn't quite as simplistic as 'men don't like women because of blah blah'. Your comments implying female redditors would somehow be pleased/justified that there was an alternative article to even the balance of the never-ending spew of girls don't like good guys comments, when in fact it has nothing to do with that, my reason for posting it was not because I am lumped into some imaginary category you have created. 

&gt;As is common on Reddit, if one spots a limitation or flaw in an article, one comments on it. I wished to suggest that this piece a mere equivalent (i.e. was no more valid than) the women-dislike-[x]-guys posts so commonly seen, and should be regarded as such. It seemed like a reasonable thing to say.

And it would have been had you actually said that, instead you chose to make a fatuous comment about the gender of the redditor that would like that sort of article, and the respective karma it would get in other reddits, implying that was the most important reason for posting that article. 

&gt;Clearly, Reddit disagrees. At the time of writing this follow-up my original comment has a score of -3, a score normally attributed to borderline racism and outright trolling. Luckily, like you, I don't pay particular attention to my cumulative karma.

Minus 3 is usually borderline racism or trolling? Seriously? Well you learn something new everyday. I have had a minus 6 before I think, because i disagreed on a professional point on AskScience. Meh. 

Well you say you don't care about karma or points yet you have mentioned it several times, and take the time to point out that you have been downvoted. Yet you still like to take the view your comment was fine and the only reason you  have been downvoted is because I disagreed with you. I don't think it is quite that simplistic somehow, not all reddit is a hive mentality. I find this UK reddit to be much better in that respect than most. It could just be that other people disagreed with your comment too.

true,rablenkov,uk,Southend-on-Sea,"Based on what you've already got, I'd suggest making a big batch of pasta sauce.  Buy a couple of onions.  Brown the cheap sausages in a pan. Set aside.  Chop the Spanish sausage, garlic and onions, then saute them off.  Add chopped tomatoes and a squirt of tomato puree if you have it.  Slice the cooled sausages into thirds and chuck those in.  Simmer.  Add some dried herbs if you have them along with salt and pepper.  Also, chuck in a large pinch of sugar to offset the acidity of the tomatoes, but don't do that until the end of cooking because it can make the sauce stick to the pan.  Eat some, freeze some.  You can get a fair few meals out of that.

Alternatively, get some onions and a bag of frozen peas.  Chop up Spanish sausage, onion, garlic.  Saute.  Throw in rice.  Mix around.  Add some stock.  Let it simmer for 20 minutes.  Throw in frozen peas, mix around, then simmer for another 5 minutes.  Bingo, you have a cheap and cheerful paella.  Fuck it, throw some chopped up cooked sausages too to bulk it out if you want.

Both of those recipes will use what you've already got, and you'll still have most of your £20.

EDIT: In my experience, I've found that the cheapest way to eat is, oddly, to spend a bit of extra money on some really powerful tasting ingredients that you can use a little of to go a long way.  A chorizo, for instance.  Also, to use up some of those cheap sausages, try this recipe from [Rick Stein](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SfNILAbHG4).  Really cheap, really tasty.

It's not *terrible* , by any stretch, but the framing device for the ""Imma visit my past selves"" vignettes didn't make any coherant sense, and the selected segments from the previous Doctors' segments relied on a much higher than average familiarity with the history of the series.

It also introduced Samantha Jones, although whether this is a plus or a minus is itself up for debate. In many ways, Sam brought with her a lot of the most annoying traits of Rose (emotionally clingy blonde everygirl) and Ace (childhood traumas, tendancy to get moody and pensive at the drop of a hat), but her arc later in the EDAs was greatly improved.

Bottom line: *The Eight Doctors* seems almost intentionally written to be enjoyed by lifelong fans (That's the show's life, not the fans' lives). To people within that group, it was mostly average, neither good nor bad. To anyone else, it was impenetrably dull.

I have, however, read all the Eighth Doctor Adventures, so here's my advice on them.

* Avoid *Longest Day* when you get to it, and just take it as read that the Doctor and Sam got separated. No, there wasn't a good reason for it. Truth be told, there wasn't a good reason for *anything* in that book.

* Similarly, you're not going to get much of an enjoyable story out of *Autumn Mist*, unless you're a gun nut.

* When you get to *Unnatural History*, remind yourself that there is no such thing as Doctor Who Canon. Otherwise, this story will seriously make you angry (Although possibly not as much as the *Interference* duology)

* Fitz is not a stand-in for the average fan, nor is his portrayal meant to be insulting to fans. If you think he's annoying early on, you will feel like a jerk later.

* *History 101* and *The Adventuress of Henrietta Street* are pretty hit-and-miss with fans, for different reasons: The former juggles an entirely too large cast in a historical setting unfamiliar to most readers, while the latter takes the tone and structure of a historical document pieced together from separate sources. If you find you can't stomach them, read their [wiki pages](http://tardis.wikia.com).

* Do not attempt to make any rational sense out of *War of the Daleks*. It is to Who-continuity what *Finnegan's Wake* was to the English language.

* If you have trouble making it through *The Eight Doctors,* the only thing of any importance that it mentions is the introduction of Samantha Jones. *Vampire Science* is *much* better.",0,1325469596,null,0,false,0,c3d3mxb,t3_nyted,t1_c3d3mxb,t3_nyted,null,1428109221,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"And you're putting words in my mouth and ignoring what I'm saying.  

Yes, I am generally talking about the - to use your description - ""Daily Mail lazy layabout dole scrounger,"" because these are the people this plan is designed to limit. I don't know how many houses are paid for by housing benefit, but 800,000 is probably a fairly small proportion of this total, and almost all of these 800,000 will be luxury houses which shouldn't really go to benefit claimants. I absolutely do not think that people should be made homeless, nor that people should be driven out of their whole city, but how can it be right that people can live at the taxpayers' expense in multi-million pound homes in Kensington? Perhaps the way this cap will be structured isn't the best, but the idea is right.  

Also, of course Mr ""Daily Mail Dole Scrounger"" benefits from picking a luxury home in Kensington for him and his family to live in at our expense. Perhaps some landlords do gain from this system, but only because the system lets them. My father is a landlord, and barely breaks even from the flats he has (he has to manage them on top of his day job.) The rents he, and every other landlord I know, charge are practically the same as the mortgages. In fact, the council tenants actually often live in nicer places and houses than my Dad and my family, as they can choose wherever they like. How is this fair?  

So, I think the conclusion is a compromise: the Government has obviously implemented this policy to try to avoid the luxury council tenants continuing to milk the system as they do. However, they may have been too heavy handed, and should probably give the duty of trying to cut unfair council tenancies the the local councils themselves, so that the caps are more relevant to their respective areas. But this policy is a step in the right direction, away from Labour's ""hey, sure, you can have a lovely house at everyone else's expense"" ways.",0,1325469647,null,0,false,0,c3d3n8k,t3_nyxd4,t1_c3d3n8k,t1_c3d39m2,null,1428109225,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

If you mean FE college/sixth form - what it will be like depends on your area of study.

If you're less academically able and more practical, there are a variety of vocational courses that make it easier to find work in this difficult economy (NVQs, BTEC etc). There is also the odd rare apprenticeship still floating around these days, so maybe you should keep an eye out for those.

I left college a long time ago - but when I was doing my A-Levels, I enjoyed it very much. I wasn't particularly social and so I didn't make that many friends, but I didn't care, I enjoyed my work and the people that I did meet were lovely.

If you don't have Netflix (and I suggest you get it, it's very much worth it), there's not really a fully LEGAL way to watch it other than perhaps going to your local video store and hoping they have it. Of course, there are always ways to obtain episodes... and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_who_episodes#Ninth_Doctor) is a list of episodes in chronological order.

And there is only one Doctor, but since the show's beginning in 1963 there have been 11 total incarnations of the Doctor, each played by a different actor (it will make sense once you watch the first series/season of the show).

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Okay, first off: Doctor Who is a british sci-fi fantasy tv show about a 900 year old alien called the Doctor, who travels through time and space in a ship that looks like a police telephone box. It's called the TARDIS, it's bigger on the inside. I know this sounds weird. He travels to anytime and anyplace having adventures.

The Doctor is able to regenerate or reincarnate his body whenever he is dying/dead/near death. New body, new personality, and then off for more adventures! So to date, we have 11 incarnations of the Doctor. Current is Matt Smith portraying #11. This might help you understand the premise: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf6H4gkErt4 And now...

Doctor Who ran from 1963-1989 then rebooted in 2005. By no means do I suggest you start at 1963. You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here
Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor. The ninth only has one series with some questionable writing, but he's a fantastic Doctor as well, and shines when given the chance.

true,kevLAXpro,lfc68,,"He is the best at what he does. Spanish (or just Barcelona) football is different. It is much more oriented to quick passing and Xavi excels at that. Not saying Stevie can't hang with him in passing, but its just a different game so the statistics are different. 
From what I've gathered, Gerrard has one of the best long shots in history. He is amazing with free kicks and if a rebound is going up the center of the field...its going in the back of the net. Gerrard (like Xavi) has an excellent ability to create the play and utilize the right players. In Gerrards case this tends to be more of a long pass from the middle 3rd of the field, where Xavi gets more into the box.

Some keep up with the literature, some don't. Some are better at some things, worse at others. See them at the end of the day and they are more likely to be stupidly tired instead of just quite a bit tired.

Personally I have found that I need to do my own research and push and prod a little in what I say. A lot of symptoms can be very vague and difficult to figure out. So often they will try something but if you still have problems you have to go back. And no they won't remember you so you have to say 'tried that, doesn't work' and be firm the next time you go. 

It is true that trying to fit a bunch of things into one appointment isn't a great idea but if they are all related it could be important, so it might be worth mentioning them to the doctor and asking them what seems related, what can we focus on this time, what can we save for next time.

If it were me I'd do some research, especially with the thyroid thing as that does run in families. Your wife might find that she notices things that she hadn't considered before that stack up, you see. OR she might find that she can definitely rule out some things and set her mind at ease. 

I am not advocating self diagnosis by any means but unless you're seeing a consultant specialist it seems to me that you need to educate yourself a little, with regard to your experience and body, so that you know what to tell the doctor, what to be firm about (this is purely my personal experience here).

The great thing about Doctor Who is that it's very diverse. It's been comedic, horror, suspense, fantasy, magical, heartbreaking, adventure filled, mystery and any other genre you can think of. If you don't like the first Doctor or you don't like the tenth, there is always a Doctor, an episode, in all 783 that you will undoubtedly adore.

tomato, onion and bacon pasta:  
Ingredients: can of chopped tomatoes, an onion, cooking bacon, mushrooms (optional). Cost: about £1  

Tescos sells cooking bacon for 80p a pack. Throw some of that in with a can of chopped tomatoes and simmer down for 20-30 minutes. Also fry up an onion and some mushrooms if you like them (you can get a huge family pack for 50p). Add a metric fuckton of herbs and some pepper to the simmering tomatoes (you can get a small shaker of value mixed herbs for 20p, just add them to everything you cook). Boil up some pasta and throw everything together and voila.  
  
Next: mussel risotto. If you don't like mussels substitute with prawns (a bit more expensive) or bacon. You can get a pack of mussels that serves two for about a quid and they taste great in this dish.
  
Ingredients: mussels, an onion, rice, mushrooms, soy sauce, vegetable stock, peas (optional). Cost: about £1.60
  
You can either go with the vegetable stock or the soy sauce, or both. Value stock cubes are about 20p, a bottle of soy sauce is 60p but you can add it to loads of stuff for extra flavour.  
  
Chop up the onion and fry it for a few minutes until it starts sweating. Then add some chopped mushrooms and fry for a few more minutes. Fry the mussels for one minute before throwing in 2/3 of a cup of rice into your wok or frying pan. Cover with a metric fuckton of mixed herbs, and pepper. Add either boiling water or boiling vegetable stock to the frying pan until the rice is covered. Add half a cup of peas (if you don't have any peas you can get a tin for under 20p). Keep adding soy sauce according to taste whilst the water gets absorbed by the rice. Keep adding water/stock until the rice has a texture and consistency you like (usually takes 20-30 minutes). Serves 2.  
  
If you're cooking for yourself just throw half of whatever you're making in a bowl/box and put it in the fridge.  
  
Sausages and mash is a quick and easy meal too. Add herbs and pepper into the mash for extra flavour. Fry up some onions and mushrooms and boil some peas on the side. You could also make a sausage pasta/risotto. Make sure to prick the sausages with a fork if you're frying them.

Can't say I condone this kind of thing... but _many_ of these are long out of print and really shouldn't be - so that is my own rationalization for snagging the opportunity.

For reading recommendations - check out the sidebar in the [DoctorWhoBooks](http://www.reddit.com/r/DoctorWhoBooks/) subreddit.  Doesn't seem to be listed in this sidebar - hmm, used to be, I think.  Somebody should remedy that - the novels are an enormous resource and well of fantastic original stories with strong editorial oversight.  Some people don't even know that the 8th Doctor had a run of 70+ novels that ran from '96-'04 or thereabouts.  

Anyway - there are links to novel rankings, ratings and general information - so check it out.

I'd suggest starting with Alien Bodies by Lawrence Miles.  An early 8th Doctor novel and always a chart topper in popularity.  Also - Lungbarrow, of course.  Notoriously hard to get a hard copy of.  Other favorites include Relative Dimentias, Camera Obscura, Festival of Death, The Witch Hunters, The Also People...

true,JB_UK,null,null,"First it's instructive to know how GPs are paid. They have a basic salary, but a significant extra proportion comes from bonuses, for treating lots of patients, and for diagnosing and treating about 15-20 of the most common illnesses (see [QOF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_Management_and_Analysis_System)). This means that they are sometimes not that interested in patients presenting with mysterious and/or uncommon diseases. In these cases, whether they admit it or not, many GPs just want you to go away, because of the money, and because to follow things up would require admitting they're uncertain, while also eating into their practice's budget (which is admittedly only a target). In those cases GPs often tell you to come back again if the problem gets worse, in the knowledge that most people won't return quickly, either because they let the problem drift, or because it clears up on its own. You may also be accused, implicitly or directly, of hypochondria. Then, most GP practices are private companies, with their own distinct cultures and attitudes, with most of the GPs either partners themselves, or people angling to become partners. So the strategies are, i) to make sure to go back if the problem remains, rather than letting it drift on, ii) to try a different GP at the same practice, iii) to try a different practice (in theory you should always be able to move, although not always in practice). If you want to do the latter, or indeed complain formally, the local Primary Care Trust is the organization you should probably go through.

If these tactics fail, or if you're particularly worried, it is quite common for people to do tests through private healthcare, and then go back to the NHS if further treatment is required. A sibling of mine had to do that, after two years of being fobbed off by our local GP practice, and then having surgery on the NHS shortly after.

Doctor Who has been going on (on and off) since 1963. The Doctor gets a new body every once in a while, this has happened 11 times. He went through 7 of them up to 1989, then there was a very long break. In 1996 there was a movie to try and restart it (8th Doctor) that failed. It was successfully restarted in 2005 with the 9th Doctor and the series numbers restarted (what was supposed to be season 27 was named series 1, any google search for season one will bring up this one, the original first season was lost to time).


Good jump in points

-The very beginning, with Doctor #1 in the original, this means there are over 200 stories to watch in over 400 episodes. Almost no new Who fans have seen any of this at all.

-New season 1, This point was designed for new viewers and absolutely no knowledge of the previous series is needed. There are then 6 seasons to watch to catch up.

-Season 5, a new cast begins here, so it's easy to jump in. This gives you 2 seasons to watch to catch up.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"I actually think this is an interesting article, and for me Dawkins has come close to explaining why I find new atheism dislikeable.

&gt; With theologians, the problem is that they don't mind being misunderstood as talking literally. Maybe they actively want it, maybe – and this is what really alarms me about them – maybe they really don't understand the difference between literal truth and poetry; or literal truth and metaphor. Maybe they don't think literal truth is even important. And this is where I would take issue with them, because for me a question like ""Does God exist?"" is not just a matter of poetry or metaphor. It has an answer, true or false (which is not to say the answer is easy to discover: it may even be impossible).

I think for Dawkins poetry is something which you 'like', essentially a piece of entertainment, or at most something with illustrative power, describing more concisely a concept which could be otherwise defined. But he does not understand that poetry may have a value and a truth in and of itself, a truth which does not arise from logic or science. Now, I actually agree that science can say that God doesn't exist, or at least sky fairy interventionist God doesn't exist. But there are limits to scientific knowledge, and beyond that point some truth, even if it is subjective, remains available. And that is where the all-but-atheist Anglican church comes in. 

When you tell your child a story, of a famous myth, something like Odysseus and the Cyclops, is it important whether those events actually happened? The 'truth' in the story does not arise from whether the events are factual or not, but from the insight you achieve. If you're telling that to your kid, and I pop up every now and again, to say 'you know this didn't happen', it is not only boorish, but irrelevant. In so doing you have attempted to apply scientific principles beyond their point of relevance. You might as well challenge someone logically on whether they prefer their garden to be kept wild or immaculately tidy, or whether they prefer romantic or modernist painting. Atheists have to push religion back, out of the realms of science, but they should not reach beyond their domain, and attempt to found all thought on scientific foundations. Rowan Atkinson believes in evolution, he believes in the scientific principle for exploring the material world, he has modern ideas on tolerance, he essentially doesn't believe in an interventionist god, or in miracles. Fundamentally, he does not extend his authority beyond his domain, and the scientific community should behave with the same good sense.

I agree about Amy, especially where it's Amy holding Rory back. The whole thing with Amy seemed so unreal that, all the way up until the end of S6 we were expecting to find out that it had all happened in Amy's private fantasy universe built from the crack in her wall. 

Also about Jenny, I just don't get why people even talk about her. She was in ONE EPISODE. She was never intended to be used again, because little miss Moffet was just getting her 15 minutes of fame.

The canon that was established in the new series is a bit different to the canon of the very old seasons of the show, where the issue of regeneration hasn't really been fleshed out.

The biggest losers in this LHA change are single adults under 35. The difficulty in expecting people to share accommodation with strangers are

1) The upheaval in moving, for what could just be a short stint of unemployment

2) Having to split bills with people who are likely employment, and enjoying luxuries such as high speed broadband and satellite. You can't *not* pay those bills while sharing, but your budget won't allow for it.

3) The on-going tragedy that is the administrative back-end of LHA. If you lose your job, you want your social security entitlements to be available yesterday. In reality, your claim can take weeks, if not months, in which time you've entered a vortex of financial difficulties. If you're sharing, this can be an even bigger ball-ache because you've got to somehow extract your accommodation component from your rent, which may or may not include some utilities, and your landlord may or may not be in the country.

Everyone is missing the point that LHA is a cluster fuck now, it was a cluster fuck then, and it shall remain a wart on the eyeball of the poor until it is replaced with a negative income tax, and let that be that. /rant",0,1325508821,null,0,false,0,c3d80zl,t3_nzp8r,t1_c3d80zl,t3_nzp8r,null,1428111374,35,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,35

true,OptioMkIX,null,null,"I think its worth pointing out that housing benefit is largely what allows most minimum wage workers in london to stay close to their jobs and stay working, and effectively subsidise low wages.

£250 a week is £1000 a month. Your minimum wage worker earns £6.08 per hour before tax, so about £243 before tax and maybe £200 after it.(assuming of course they get their full earnings, and that dick managers or company policies dont take some of it away.)

A lot of people will simply say ""They shouldnt live somewhere they cant afford, and they'll have to move."" OK. Where should they move to? The suburbs? Alright.

So now their rent is slightly cheaper. They now have transport costs. At peak times (Eg, just before and after your average 9-5 workday) it costs me about £5 each way to get into london and back, before counting the tube. Ten pounds a day. Fifty pounds a week. Two hundred a month. Those wages that were previously subsidised (or in fact doubled) are now severely depleted. Surely this would lead to a knock-on effect in reducing demand for goods as people have to make do with what money they have and as we are all painfully aware with utility and other bills rising at an excruciating rate, money just doesnt go as far as it used to.

If this goes through then there has to be a corresponding relief mechanism for areas with very high living costs (like london) or a substantial step change in the NMW.

The point is not that this move will make polygraphs admissable in court - it's that it'll contribute to people trusting them and believing they have objective scientific merit, and gradually, over time that public perception means they're more likely to end up eventually being permitted in court.

People are not generally well-educated in scientific matters, and can easily be persuaded d to support almost any old bullshit as long as it looks and sounds vaguely plausible.  This is why we throw away millions each year on homoeopathic NHS hospitals. :-/

&gt; The idea is that the polygraph suggests possible lines of enquiry which are then properly followed up

The trouble is, there's a hefty amount of doubt whether polygraphed actually give *any* meaningful results at all, or whether they're more misleading than actually helpful.

Your whole argument is predicated on the idea they're at least minimally trustworthy, but the whole objection of the scientific consensus against polygraphs is *they're not*.

And adding in an investigative technique that potentially throws up more false leads isn't a cost-free action - it wastes police time and resources, means other leads aren't followed up, and in extreme cases can contribute to wrongful convictions.

And they may be correct.

A negative income tax, for those of you who are interested in dreaming of a better future, is a system where your get paid when your income is below a certain threshold, in the same way you get money taken off you when it goes above a threshold.

For example, let it be that £5,000/year is what it is decided is needed for a person to pay for rent and buy food and get a bus pass, etc. (all the things that are meant to be covered by LHA, JSA, Income Support, Working Tax Credits and other bolocks). The income tax system in this example starts at £10,000, and you are taxed at 50% above that. If you are unemployed and earn £0, you are entitled to 50% of the difference between £0 and £10,000; £5,000. If you manage to wrangle a job for a few hours a week pulling pints, your earnings go up to £1,000, and since this is bellow £10,000, you receive 50% of the difference; £4,500 from the government, and £1,000 from your boss.

Under a negative income tax you are always better off working, not just because of the arithmetic of it all, but because you don't have to dick around with the Department of Work and Pensions, or the Job Centre, or whatever stupid office you need to interface with these days.

I'm pretty sure that there's an IOC requirement for chauffeured vehicles as part of the games, so they can't just tell VIPs to get public transport, because by entering a bid they agreed to abide by the rules of the IOC.

The ideal solution would be to have a fleet of electric vehicles commissioned especially for the games, but I'm sure people would have baulked at the cost, suggesting it's a big white elephant, wasting tax payers money, blah blah blah.

So then you look at something like the volt/ampera, and see if you could get GM to be an official sponsor of the games, but GM has only sold a few thousand of these vehicles, and also probably wouldn't want to risk any high profile exposure if its new vehicle fails to come up to scratch so early in its life.

Sonar cant detect anything close to the ground. Sonar works (as you probably know) by sending out ""waves"" that are then reflected back at the antenna that reads the position.

However on the ground the sonar/radar system would be disrupted by the interference from buildings, trees, rocks, animals, and general terrain formations. This is why it wouldnt work for detecting angels on the ground :)

Here's a good extract from the Robert Mochrie case.  
http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2002/jul/13/weekend.kevintoolis  


&gt;""With a crisis such as debt or divorce, most of us would find some way of coping,"" says Harris. ""But to those prone to delusions, their belief system could grow until they believed that the only way out was for everyone to die.""

&gt;Robert Mochrie conforms to what American criminologists now define as a new sub-category of killer, the ""family annihilator"". According to Professor Jack Levin, director of the Brudnick Centre on Conflict and Violence at Northeastern university in Boston, ""The family annihilator is a middle-aged white man, a good father, a good husband, a responsible provider, who suffers a catastrophic loss, usually financial, but sometimes sexual, in terms of divorce. They become despondent, hopeless about the future and usually blame everyone else apart from themselves. They feel themselves to be victims. But they love their children.""  

&gt;Family annihilators have no prior criminal record. Many, in fact, are model citizens - but they share one key characteristic: like Robert, they tend to be introverted. ""They are loners,"" says Levin. ""These killers don't share responsibility. They have the mental attitude that they are 'commander-in-chief', and that it's lonely at the top. They cannot share their problems with the foot soldiers.""

&gt;Family annihilators go to great lengths to plan their crimes; they do not kill in the heat of the moment, or in a fit of rage. ""They are very methodical,"" says Levin. ""They plan it out for a long time. They are careful to minimise the pain and suffering of the children - who most likely never knew what hit them. This is methodical, selective murder by a rational, loving father. That's why it is so terrifying.""

I'll make a few comments:

My reading of the British Social Attitudes survey released last month, which Oborne mentions, gives the numbers as being slightly different:

[50% - No religion.    
Of those who say they are religious, 56% never attend religious services.](http://ir2.flife.de/data/natcen-social-research/igb_html/pdf/chapters/BSA28_12Religion.pdf)

i.e. Less than 25% of the population ever go to a religious worship of any kind or religion.

His attendance figures, ignoring the larger evangelical movements, are pitiful! The numbers involved are nothing fancy at all, and certainly not enough to cause a song and dance. Even he makes it clear several times, though he doesn't admit it, that immigration is playing a large factor. Hence why the increase in worship etc. is positive in London and negative *everywhere else*!

&gt; Over the last 12 months, attendance at the main Sunday service at the church (where my wife Martine is curate) has risen by nearly 20 per cent, from around 95 to 115. 

**20%**! Come on... This like saying ""The murder rate has increased 100% on last year: 2 people were killed instead of 1. When there's a change in tiny numbers, the fraction increase/decrease is large. He would have done better not to give us the actual figures.

Also, having a look at the CoE's own data, their numbers aren't growing at all! The best they've got is a tiny decline. However I have no doubt that that figure is larger (greater decline), not because it's in my interest for it to be declining, but because it's not in the churches interest for it to be doing so.

In recent years they've moved from counting Sunday attendance, to weekly and now to monthly. Meanwhile the numbers keep going down. [This entry from Church Mouse](http://churchmousepublishing.blogspot.com/2011/02/church-of-england-attendance-statistics.html), which is a religious based blog, gives a little look at the 2009 figures that were released recently.

I don't know where Oborne is getting his numbers from:

&gt;  More than 1.7 million attend Church of England services in the average month.

According to the CoE's own data;

&gt;  [...average monthly attendance at 1,651,000...](http://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2011/02/provisional-attendance-figures-for-2009-released-attending-a-local-cofe-church-continues-to-be-part-of-a-typical-week-for-11-million-people.aspx)

I can forgive the rounding up, but it's not ""more than"" by a long shot. In any case, I've questioned their ""average monthly"" numbers before now. [These numbers (PDF) are from 2007.](http://www.churchofengland.org/media/37495/2007provisionalattendance.pdf) Note the numbers of page 2:

Average Sunday Attendance/Average Weekly Attendance, including ""Weekly highest, weekly lowest"". For the children, this number goes (in 2007) from weekly lowest 99k to weekly highest 424k, with Sunday being lowest 79k and highest 252k.

That's a *huge* difference, much more of a change than the adults, which leads me to think that the CoE are counting things like Church parade for Scouts, Guides, Brownies and St John's Ambulance etc. and possibly even meetings of said groups.

That's the only reason I can come up with for such a change in the numbers, which leads me to question the motives of their counting. Also consider that they've changed from Sunday, to weekly to monthly counting in the last few years, and that they are doing things like this:

&gt; [The CofE has started focusing on ‘All-Age Attendance’ – i.e. these two figures combined, which increases the number of growing dioceses from 4 to 7 over the period.](http://churchmousepublishing.blogspot.com/2011/02/church-of-england-attendance-statistics.html)

(point 1 from General Comments and Qualifiers, near the bottom of the page)

I went slightly off topic, but the question is basically this: Why you gotta lie about it?

I don't know who Mr Oborne is trying to convince. It's quite clear from his vested interests and language: 

&gt; Despondent churchmen judged that there were just too many alternative attractions — Sunday shopping, sports fixtures and the relentless **secularism** of modern Britain.

that he has an agenda. Funnily enough the CoE is no longer the majority religion in this country - certainly not when it comes to active members. Given that secularism actually protects minority religions and ensures they are free to practice without being ordered around by other faiths, you'd think he'd have more sense and find out what secularism actually involves before talking crap.

Also I question his comments on football:

&gt; This figure could be larger, but it is still enormous, far more than the number who attend football matches, often assumed to be Britain’s favourite weekend activity. 

[In 2009 9.9m fans attended UK championship matches](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/may/21/football-league-attendance). That is FAR higher than the number of people who went to church, even when you factor in people going to Christmas services. Of course Oborne is saying that monthly more people attend, but it's going to be pretty much the same people going to church each month. There's no way that 1.7m *different* people go to church every month. Also consider how many people couldn't get to a stadium to see a match and how many people watch it on the tele - there's far more interest in football than religion. Using the BSA survey (and including children), with a population of 62million people, only ~13.6million people ever attend a religious function. 31million people have no religion and ~17.3million are religious but never attend ceremonies.

Of course these numbers should be much lower, because children should not be counted either way.

The church is no way as popular as football and to claim otherwise is misguided. Which would be why Mr Oborne didn't include any numbers, I think.

Sorry about that. I had a miny rant.

go to website, if content is missing, right click the noscript icon in your addon bar. (if you can't see your addon bar, tap alt - go to view -toolbars- addonbar)

starting from the TLD (the .com or .org of the site you are visiting) allow or temporarily allow if you are unsure as you can always make temp permissions permanent. Untill the content you want is displayed/useable

use the temp permissions to feel out what you want showing on the site.

do this and after a while every site you visit is stripped of the crap you don't want/need and browsing to a new site takes a few seconds to set up your allow list.

also i recommend getting chrome installed if you ever have someone else using your computer and they need a browser, it is MUCH easier to hand them a browser that does not need you to faf with an allow list when they want to look at something.

Taught: The general stuff, though public schools don't have to follow the national curriculum. I believe (I am open to correction) they are subject to Ofsted, but Ofsted judge the school on its own standards. Within reason.

Methods: Can't comment, but I would have thought similar to everywhere else? Perhaps more relaxed to a certain degree.

Doctorates: No, I don't believe so. A friend of mine teaches at one of the major public schools in England but doesn't have one.

Leaders: It varies, I think. Some of ""Who you know, not what you know"", but also coming from families that are well connected, established and have a historical background in politics helps. How many kids from Eton have people in government in some way? I think a child from such a background is much more likely to fall into that field in the same way that the child of a doctor is likely to think that doctoring is the field for them. Not all the time, of course, but the opportunity and training is given from a very young age at public schools. One of the reasons children from public schools do so well at getting to Oxbridge is, to a certain degree, because they have been instructed in the art of debate etc. as well as being more likely to have been told 'they're worth it' from a very young age.

I can be, because these developments are likely to lead to further developments which will make humanities lot better as a whole. After all, it was one sided technological developments in the west that lead to the global eradication of small pox, which was a net benefit to the species. The same can be said of programs to eradicate malaria, cancer etc, or programs to develop renewable power rather than continue to burn fossil fuels or wood. If you try to suppress things because you see it as unfair that not everyone can benefit from it, you will dramatically slow the rate of technological progression and you will be doing so at a time when it is needed most. 

&gt; Instead the majority have been sold an ideology of competition and one-upmanship and these things have taken us to the brink of disaster.

 * Lights: About £15 for a set of lights which I replace every 1-2 years.
 * Gloves: £30 One off purchase. 5 - 10 years. I used to use old socks.
 * Water proof trousers: £30 One off purchase. I used to get wet, and change.
 * ~~Puncher~~ Puncture resistant tyres: £30 One off purchase.

Maintenance:

 * Tool kit: £35 One off purchase, I used to borrow tools from friends.
 * Grease/Oil/Cleaner: £10/year
 * Chains: £10 every 2-3 years
 * Gears etc: £30 every 2-3 years.
 * Brake pads, £10 every 2-3 years.
 * Inner tubes: £2 in repairs every year (I've only had 3 puncture in the last few years)

External Costs - being generous.

 * Extra food: ~£40. If you bought 2.5 Boosts bars a week to replace the energy you used.
 * Extra washing: ~£20. 52 extra washes.
 * Extra shower gel: ~£10

Time: 10-20 hours a year.

~£250 on your first year if you bought everything straight away, which I doubt would happen.

I would say that I do a fair amount of extra weekend riding which adds a lot to wear and tear costs. 

Riding a bike is so much cheaper than any other form of transport in London, even if you only do it in the summer months (which is even cheaper because you don't need anything extra) it will save you money hand over fist.

We have a good amount of transfer money, but not the wage budget to compete with teams like Real Madrid.  Probably would have to break our wage structure to sign Higuain (I'm assuming here, I don't exactly know how much he makes).  We have little pull for top talent right now and we have to accept that.  Not OP, but when some fans are expecting bids for players like Eden Hazard, I want to smack them.  They think one of the top 3 best prospects in the entire world will come to us?

I'm not saying we'll never sign world class talent, but it really shouldn't be expected right now.  It'll take shrewd moves like what we did for Suarez.  Took a bit of a risk on a tricky player abroad, he fit right into our league and left all the other top teams wondering why the hell they didn't move for him.  Doesn't seem like a risk now given how much he surpassed our expectations of him, but no one knew how good he would be for us at the time.

As opposed to risks, I think we took a lot of safe options over the summer with people who've performed well in the PL.  Not a bad idea to build a spine for the team, but I look forward to players we take a chance on.  I don't really think January is the right time for that, the market is generally inflated and no time to work the player in through training.  But if Comolli and his scout team find someone I hope they'd take it.

Basically, I'm expecting limited activity and maybe a not so captivating signing, like Bent.  I'm not too thrilled on Bent either, I don't think he's automatic goals as is often claimed.

I think we made a mistake not giving McEachran more minutes early in the season. He could have taken some of the creative pressure off Mata.

Another thing I think we can definitely agree on is that lack of finishing is costing us points. Torres was great today at everything but finishing. Drogba is hot and cold.

Usual stuff, everyone does GCSE in a few core subjects and then you get to choose from pretty much the same options that they have at any other school.


&gt; What are the teaching methods?

Teaching method depends on the teacher; some stick rigidly to the syllabus, others like to encourage a general interest in the material. The work is very competitive. Classes at Eton (pre-GCSE anyway) were arranged in kind of a league table format, and you get class rankings at the end of term.


&gt; Do all the teachers hold doctorates?

No way, although the quality of teaching is generally very good.


&gt; What is it about Eton, Harrow, Westminster etc that produces so many leaders in their field? Or does it have nothing to do with the schools, is it just that the students there probably already come from rich and well connected families?

There are plenty of privileged kids who are only at Eton and who succeed in life with little effort purely because they are born into wealthy and well connected families, most people however are there because they're very intelligent and worked their asses off to get into the school, and they succeed for those reasons. Either way you spend five long years living with these people day in day out, which makes for good connections in life.

I can see how that level of sheer blatant mirroring real-life events (even when you pretend not to) could be seen as perhaps slightly unfunny/unsatirical although I must admit that didn't stop me from finding it rather amusing. ;-)

My only real gripe with this was that at times, it felt a bit rushed. Still, Claire Foy as Rebecca Brooks was really good to watch.

Trivial comment I noticed on the Guardian: Lisa Greenwood plays the same role in *Hacks* as Zoe as she did in BBC2's *The Hour*

The only question now is how far it will go....550, 650.....1000ppm? 

Right around the time we start to experience the really serious effects of climate change, we'll bump straight into a giant energy crunch, probably causing us to shift increasingly to dirtier forms of energy (oil sands, shale gas, more coal), exacerbating the problem beyond belief.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor.

While I was still in the planning phase, I toyed with the idea of doing a model with a working light and speaker. I decided to go the lighter route though, as a friend of mine who's a smoker had a birthday coming up. That, and the lighter was going to be *so* much easier. If I wind up making more, I might try making one with the integrated electronics to play the TARDIS sound and flash the appropriate lights. I would certainly enjoy designing and building the circuit. I have some reservations with making a model of that type though.

My biggest problem with doing just a straight repro that looks, sounds, and blinks like the TARDIS, is just the fact that very similar items are already available for sale. Sure, the handmade aspect adds some element of character, but so far as I'm aware, nobody has ever made a TARDIS table lighter before. Second, if I start making more to sell, the table lighter could arguably be considered a replica of a generic police call box. Add the lights and sound though, and it becomes undeniably TARDIS. I don't know much about intellectual property law, but from my understanding, it could be considered copyright infringement. Granted, I'll probably never make enough of these for this to be of any real concern; by the same token I'll never make enough from these to justify taking any sort of such risk.

Same with fruit and veg - find a good produce stall at your market/shop in local area and become a regular customer.

The biggest lie supermarkets have sold us is that we don't have time to cook properly in our hyper busy super frenetic modern lives. Learn how to make five or six dishes - from there you will naturally extend your repetoire as confidence grows and you become accustomed to cooking.

Also, by going to your nearest supermarket near closing you will find bargains in the ""reduced/peasant shopper"" shelf.

Nonsense.  Science cannot prove such a negative, see Russells teapot.  Even Dawkins would call you an idiot for thinking that ""science says God doesn't exist"".

&gt;But there are limits to scientific knowledge, and beyond that point some truth, even if it is subjective

Science is an ever expanding pocket of knowledge and 'God' is an ever receding pocket﻿ of scientific ignorance.  What does ""*beyond science*"" even mean?  To be beyond science is to be beyond reality.
 
&gt;The 'truth' in the story does not arise from whether the events are factual or not, but from the insight you achieve.

And despite Rowan **Williams** knowing that there never was an Adam and thus no original sin for Jesus to atone for will he come out and say as much to the ignorant members of his church that believe as such?  Or will he dress it up in metaphor and skirt around the edges of the hard truth that the only reason they are in a church at all is because of a politically cunning Roman emperor and the fact that Saul of Tarsus was never diagnosed as being mentally ill?

There's nothing wrong with a good story and making use of good metaphors to illustrate a moral.  But the charge of fundamental dishonesty at Williams more than just.

&gt;If you're telling that to your kid, and I pop up every now and again, to say 'you know this didn't happen', it is not only boorish, but irrelevant.

""Science is like a blabbermouth who ruins the movie by telling you how it ends. Well, I say there are some things we don't want to know. Important things!""

Tell me that again after you have to explain to your child that she can't fly like Peter Pan and she has to come in off the window ledge and close the window.  Perhaps instead you would tell her that ""what's actually real"" isn't important?

There is a lengthy discussion in the opinion about the awkwardness of the phrase, and my understanding was that the panel concluded that it was possible because Suarez had played with and interacted with a number of different types of Spanish and Portuguese speakers, and in the course of doing so might have acquired a sort of in-between, slang language for certain purposes.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; Nonsense. Science cannot prove such a negative, see Russells teapot. Even Dawkins would call you an idiot for thinking that ""science says God doesn't exist"".

The disproof of an interventionist God proceeds in much the same way as a proof for evolution. i.e. by accretion of evidence one way or another, rather than by any dramatic logical swoop. In a strictly logical sense we cannot disprove anything, but in reality the scientific community is constantly accepting and rejecting proposals on the basis of the evidence which has been unearthed.

&gt; Science is an ever expanding pocket of knowledge and 'God' is an ever receding pocket﻿ of scientific ignorance. What does ""beyond science"" even mean? To be beyond science is to be beyond reality.

So let me make this clear, you believe there is no limit to scientific knowledge? You believe that science can rule on the validity of art, and morality, and subjective individual experiences? It may well be the case that all things can be described within the construct of the material, physical world. That appreciation of art is dyes reflecting photons absorbed by retinoids, creating electrons in a pattern, passed through synapses. 

That doesn't mean that the world is deterministic, or predictable, or capable of being meaningfully expressed through the language of science, or, even so, within reach of modern science. For whatever reason, our experience of the world at present cannot be explained through science, and we have to use other, subjective sources of wisdom to make decisions- do I like this painting?, or more broadly, how should I live my life? So you can either say that science should not extend beyond its fundamental domain, or certainly, it should not extend beyond its level of competence.

true,hauntedchippy,null,null,"&gt;The disproof of an interventionist God proceeds in much the same way as a proof for evolution.

i.e. proof by induction.  Which is never *proof* in the absolute sense which only exists in mathematics.  You cannot disprove a god, only infer that her existence is unlikely because she has never been observed despite very intense and unceasing experiment.  This wiggle room is enough for most religious believers but it does leave them with a very impotent deistic type of god.  Certainly the type of god that Williams probably believes in but is being deliberately obfuscatory about it to maintain his church, hence Dawkins' charge of dishonesty.

&gt;So let me make this clear, you believe there is no limit to scientific knowledge? You believe that science can rule on the validity of art, and morality, and subjective individual experiences? 

You are being rather callous with your definition of knowledge if you include opinions on art to be knowledge.  Besides, subjective individual experiences aren't as off limits as you imagine; we are reading thoughts with fMRI scanners these days, even recording them before you are aware of them.

&gt;That doesn't mean that the world is deterministic, or predictable, or capable of being meaningfully expressed through the language of science, or, even so, within reach of modern science.

No of course it doesn't, but that doesn't therefore imply the opposite.  Proof by induction again, show me a system to gain knowledge of the real world that doesn't work by measurement, observation, experiment or logical conjecture (i.e. science).

&gt;or whatever reason, our experience of the world at present cannot be explained through science, and we have to use other, subjective sources of wisdom to make decisions- do I like this painting?

Doesn't it now?  When you 'like' something a very specific set of neurons are activated.

&gt;or more broadly, how should I live my life?

Now this is where I will agree with you.  Science is not a tool for telling you what you ought to do.  It can (theoretically) tell you what actions would make you happy, but that doesn't mean you *should* do them.

It can only tell you what you *should* do if you already know what you want the outcome to be.  Indeed, nothing can tell you what you ought to do.

&gt;Either way, at present there remains space for non-scientific voices in public and private discourse.

.........................Reina..........................

Johnson.....Skrtel.........Agger.........Enrique

...................Spearing............................

..........................Adam/Henderson..........

Downing.........................................Maxi

.....................Carroll......Suarez.............


Super Subs: Gerrard for Adam/Hendo, Bellamy for Maxi/Carroll/Suarez, Shelvey (put Gerrard out wide for Downing)

What I like about this lineup;

Our back 4 is a lock... nothing new here. Using Spearing as a CDM who has been looking like a great wrecker... just needs to make sure his tackles are smart and clean (don't leave any option for the official to make another bullshit red). I would usually be happy with Adam playing ahead/alongside Spearing, but he has been in poor form... so toss up for me between Adam/Hendo as it largely depends on who is going to actually show up and play. Maxi has played very well off of Suarez so positioning them as such is beneficial and as we all know Downing pairs much better with Johnson overlapping than Enrique. Carroll also likes to float to the back post so when the ball is outside with Downing that should work with crosses in... if Downing could just start actually pinging quality crosses (see Gerrard). 

Planned substitutions (if things are going to plan or are needed) would likely be Gerrard in for Adam/Hendo at 60-65 minutes and Bellamy for Maxi. Gerrard links great with Carroll and the more time they are on the pitch together the better. Bellamy (if his knees are still good to go) will give us some fresh legs and nice added speed down that left wing. We could also bring Shelvey on for Adam/Hendo and put Gerrard out wide for Downing... let him knock some crosses into Carroll which I also really like.

I do have a few questions if you've the time - these are just for my own curiosity, I won't use any of this stuff as part of my research (if not, no worries):

I read lots of accounts by unionists/Orange Order/etc. that accused the Garvaghy Road community of ""bussing people in"" to make the nationalist protest look bigger than it was (this was a complaint almost every year) - do you think this was the case? Or were most nationalists who were protesting Garvaghy residents? Things are so often a he-said-she-said in NI!

I also spoke with many protesters to the banning who were on the Hill with the Orangemen who said that (prior to 1998 and the deaths of the Quinn brothers) the standoff was actually quite good craic each July - it was like a summer campout sort of thing. Do you think nationalists ever had the same sense, or were things always 100% serious on that side?

Do you know whether the IRA/Real IRA/and/or/etc were ever involved? I often wonder if they offered to become involved, seeing as the loyalist paramilitaries were so very present.

I attempted to do interviews with people who still live in Portadown and experienced Drumcree as locals and most people did NOT want to talk about it, particularly local nationalists. I was surprised when I first arrived, as the Norn Irish are generally so talkative, but I got the impression that it still might not be ""okay"" for people to go on record with their opinions.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"That’s more or less what I’m talking about. When confronted by emotion the rationalist mind-set demands direct causality and assumes that the resulting chemical changes in our brain from feeling must in turn be the cause; it’s the same approach many scientists take to free will. That’s entirely the problem; it’s the only approach rationalism can take to the issue, and so they diminish these experiences in order to fit them neatly within their world view.

For example; say you are deeply in love with some one I’ve not met. You could describe and justify your feels for them to me; why you are attracted to them, what you appreciate about their personality and habits (etc.), and then I could meet this person and also appreciate these very same qualities and be attracted to them in the way nature demands. But despite that I probably wouldn’t be in love with them. I wouldn’t feel what you feel.

How can rationalism describe emotions? It can’t; it can only reduce them to chemical reactions or evolutionary responses. But love is plainly more then that; there is a fairly vast body of documented human experience to support this.

The point is that rationalism, and by extension science, can’t hope to explain every part of human experience without discarding some essential part of humanity along the way.

true,hauntedchippy,null,null,"&gt;that the resulting chemical changes in our brain from feeling must in turn be the cause

Not the cause but the feeling itself.  When we talk of neurons forming memories, no one says ""this particular pattern *causes* memory x"", that pattern *is* the memory.

&gt;and so they diminish these experiences in order to fit them neatly within their world view.

Completely unjustified.  In what way is something diminished by understanding it? Is it not enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it to? 

Do you believe that Newton 'destroyed the rainbow' when he explained it's physical origins?

&gt;ou could describe and justify your feels for them to me; why you are attracted to them, what you appreciate about their personality and habits (etc.), and then I could meet this person and also appreciate these very same qualities and be attracted to them in the way nature demands.

A false dichotomy and a bad one at that.  Nature demands?  What on earth do you mean?  All those experiences you list in the first part have physical origins and manifestations which doesn't make them any less real (rather the opposite).

&gt;But despite that I probably wouldn’t be in love with them. I wouldn’t feel what you feel.

You mean two people are not identical?  Shocker.  Nature doesn't demand you love someone (especially if you don't actually love them).  If you do love someone then that does manifest itself physically whether you want to admit that or not.

&gt;How can rationalism describe emotions? It can’t; it can only reduce them to chemical reactions or evolutionary responses.

Not as true as you would like to imagine.  You know that horrible sick feeling you sometimes get when you hear or read about something morally despicable?  Would it surprise you to learn that the *exact same* area of the brain is activated when you are *actually* physically sick? It's not *like* you are feeling ill, you *are* feeling ill (and in measurable way if I put you in a fMRI.  Does it bother you that I could describe *your* feelings to you (perhaps before you were even aware of them?).

Genes have selected themselves over time to produce a reward/incentive program for you to protect your immediate family (i.e. your genes) and the brain didn't need to create a new reward system to do this, it just co-opted existing ones.

It would be nice if the BBC actually countered the obvious PR bullshit and spurious logic for once in a while.

What on earth does that say for the system's faith in punishment as a deterrent? These low level criminals receiving legal aid is too much an expensive not to mention 'housing' costs. Better to have them quietly slink away.

It's amazing how the 'rioters' can be fast tracked through the legalistic malaise when it suits with unusually harsh penalties. Of course, it is done to 'send a signal' and these people have no leverage. Why then isn't a similar signal sent to these officers?

Personally speaking, I know that my figures of speech can alter dramatically over time, and based on context and my emotional state etc.  My point was that, unlike the implication in this article, the Commission's report did address the issue of the formulation of the phrase (albeit not in a comprehensive manner) and concluded that although it was abnormal, it was not impossible that Suarez could have said it.  That information combined with the facts that Evra's version of the story almost never changed from his reaction at the time, immediately after the match, and at the trial; that Suarez's testimony had a number of inconsistencies, including changing what he remembered saying, and when the exchange happened; that Evra's account was plausible given the video evidence (while Suarez's was less so because his account didn't really seem to give enough talking for the time they had); that Evra's account appeared balanced because he admitted (without prompting or even corroboration from Suarez) that he initiated the angry conversation and swore at Suarez; and that some aspects of Suarez's final testimony appeared to have been given based on other reports that had come out, and were unconvincing at providing a reasonable explanation all lend the Commission's decision credibility.

As I've said before, I don't agree with the severity of the punishment, or completely with the amount of weight given to Evra's testimony.

There are plenty of people who wouldn't do it without the bonus, and plenty more people (myself included) who wouldn't pursue the career for love nor money.

Sure, it goes without saying, although it's worth noting most of the people earning six-figure salaries right now will have entered the profession before the recent recession.

Regarding support staff, as far as I'm aware their work is far from comparable to that of the bankers themselves. 

&gt; The base salaries are hardly meagre compared to the rest of the country (and London salaries) but they're far from what we see printed in the media. You're right about them relying on the bonus, but there are plenty of other people who would be willing to do that job for less, given the chance. The banks know this and use it to their advantage.

I'm sure there are some people who could and would be willing to perform the same job for less. The graduate recruitment market in particularly is *extremely* competitive at the moment. Unfortunately this talent is lost in a sea of people who *think* they could do the job, but would simply fall flat on their face, lose the company a bunch of money and get sacked in no time. 

Then again, no PLC is in the habit of paying their employees unnecessarily large salaries. If a banker is being paid £250k, it goes without saying they will have earned the company more than that over the course of the year.

Edit: For anyone interested, there was a brilliant three-part BBC documentary series called [Million Dollar Traders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_Dollar_Traders) that aired back in January 2009. 12 people from various backgrounds (soldier, shopkeeper, student, environmentalist, day trader, etc.) were given $1 million between them to trade for 2 months. 

There were tears, tantrums, the lot. One contestant, a car trader, quit on the first day. Many others walked out throughout the course of the programme. Between the 12 of them, over the course of two months, the best they could do was lose £12,000.

I'd thoroughly recommend anyone watch the series before casting aspersions about whether City salaries are reasonable or justified.",0,1325598649,null,0,true,0,c3diuzx,t3_o0x3b,t1_c3diuzx,t1_c3direi,null,1428116544,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"&gt; Sure, it goes without saying, although it's worth noting most of the people earning six-figure salaries right now will have entered the profession before the recent recession.

True, but you could've said the same about miners in the 1980s.

&gt; Regarding support staff, as far as I'm aware their work is far from comparable to that of the bankers themselves.

Regarding support staff, the bankers wouldn't be able to do their jobs without them. From the people that write and run the software that gives the bankers the information to make the deals down to the people who sign off on them, the people who make the trades wouldn't be able to function. This is not as clear cut as say a sales/delivery split for retail.

&gt; I'm sure there are some people who could and would be willing to perform the same job for less. The graduate recruitment market in particularly is extremely competitive at the moment. Unfortunately this talent is lost in a sea of people who think they could do the job, but would simply fall flat on their face, lose the company a bunch of money and get sacked in no time.

I concur, as do most banks, which is why most graduates go through back office before becoming traders themselves, and the quants work on the systems for algorithmic trading before being allowed to become traders. Banks will not stick random guys from the streets in a position of trading, no matter what you've read about Jerome Kerviel or Nick Leeson.

I've seen the first two episodes of the series you mentioned. They were no more likely to succeed than hairdressers at rewiring and replumbing a house.

What I can tell you is that in the current climate that bonuses for bankers on a pre-crash scale are unsustainable. The banks aren't capitalised enough to support it, and the markets won't bear it. The bankers of old are screaming blue murder about it, particularly in places that took no government money who want the party to carry on. The guys in the back office are getting squeezed, but for the contractors it's mostly business as usual. There are too many people within the banks and those who've been out of work from places like lehmans and so on floating around to keep justifying the bonuses and the banks use this to scare the bankers. Some will sue, although those that do probably won't last more than 12 months in their job and will be quickly replaced by unemployed bankers.",0,1325601399,null,0,false,0,c3dj4y0,t3_o0x3b,t1_c3dj4y0,t1_c3diuzx,null,1428116733,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

He has shown a lot of hunger and desire which some of his team-mates are unfortunately missing. Take Sturridge for example. He has been playing out wide this season and has played brilliantly, scored a lot of goals. But his passes/crosses from out wide have been really terrible, resulting in very few opportunities for Torres.

My sister, as a result of family difficulties (nasty divorce ect), is currently studying in a state school in England. 

I guess the main things are a restrictive national curriculum, less after school activities, fewer facilities ect.

Her first primary school in Bolton was a bit rough and tumble, not much in the ways of facilities and the kids weren't the sharpest tools in the shed. The two schools in Christchurch seem to be of good quality and  she appears to be doing well there.

If she was in the private school in sg, she would probably speak basic mandarin, briefly learnt an instrument, take part yearly in a school wide culture and dance evening, performed in one of the many plays, take part in community services, raised funds for charities , go on exciting field trips abroad ect. There is just so much more that private schools can offer.

true,petenu,cnty-uk,Rdg,"&gt; Are you getting 4OD and iPlayer fine? I was thinking I'd go with something a bit mental like Gentoo and a cheap nVidia card (8400GS?) with HDMI out.

The processor is a Intel Core i3 2100T (Sandy Bridge) and the motherboard is a Asus P8H61-M PRO. No dedicated graphics card (I wanted it to be a low-power, low-heat HTPC, not a gaming rig). Haven't tried 4OD but I've had no problems with iPlayer in high-def.

&gt; I am interested in the keyboard you're using and the components I know nothing about (TV Tuner and Bluetooth receiver). Are you using a micro case and mobo and is it silent?

The keyboard I'm using at the moment is a Keysonic ACK-450BT but I'd hesitate to recommend it. I was getting absolutely appalling range, but admittedly it's improved since I moved the receiver dongle from the USB port on the front of the case to the end of a USB extender cable. I got the RF version for Xmas (as it was on my Amazon wishlist) which might be better, but I haven't tried it yet.

The case is a Silverstone GD05B - it blends in nicely with the rest of my hi-fi equipment (same width, same depth, and only slightly taller than my amp). It does have 3 12mm case fans which are fairly loud, but it wouldn't be hard (or expensive) to swap these for some 4-pin quiet fans. For me, the standard ones are tolerable for the time being.

From the people that write and run the software that gives the bankers the information to make the deals down to the people who sign off on them, the people who make the trades wouldn't be able to function. This is not as clear cut as say a sales/delivery split for retail.

They perform an essential role, but the employment of particular individuals is not essential to the success of the business. It's important not to conflate the two concepts. Generally speaking, people with the necessary skills and qualifications to perform back office duties are a dime a dozen.

As an example, an investment bank could fire half their IT or HR departments today, and within a week could have each and every one of those individuals replaced with others, with matching qualifications and experience, being paid the same salary.

Talented investment bankers are scarce, and highly mobile. This is why they command such high salaries. If you have a banker who has netted £500k for your company this year, and is being headhunted by every other major investment bank, would you give him a £150k bonus to retain him, or tell him to get stuffed?

If you consistently told your highest-grossing bankers to get stuffed when they come looking for bonuses, do you think you're going to attract and retain the best talent?

&gt; I've seen the first two episodes of the series you mentioned. They were no more likely to succeed than hairdressers at rewiring and replumbing a house.

Not really a fair comparison. Not only were they given all the necessary tools (a fancy City office, $1m capital, Bloomberg terminals, brokers, etc.) and taught how to use them, but they were also personally trained by Lex van Dam, and had access to his knowledge and expertise throughout the experiment. 

The programme actually attempted to portray their £12k loss as a *success*, and van Dam has sought to use the show as ""proof"" that his trading method works. 

More interesting than how much money they lost, however, is how they adapted (or rather, failed to adapt) to the life of an investment banker. It's not pretty. They don't sit in their offices sipping champagne all day. Most don't have a healthy work-life balance.

To reiterate, when it comes to PLCs, there's not a chance in hell they would be paying their employees any more than they *have* to in order to protect the interests of the business.",0,1325604673,null,0,false,0,c3djixz,t3_o0x3b,t1_c3djixz,t1_c3dj4y0,null,1428116914,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Most traders are not prop traders (working with the banks money) but instead respond to the direct needs / wants of a client. The sales teams help materialise this want / need.

A client is not necessarily an individual, but might be another financial institution or branch of government even. A trader who deals in FX, for example, is mandated to trade with clients for certain currency pairs and at certain values. 

A riskier client may get a worse rate on their FX deal than one with great credit history - but the risk appetite for the FX desk would not be set by the trader themselves.

But it does take a certain amount of fluency to understand the nuances of what negro means to native speakers. This entire situation is predicated on Evra's understanding of the world Negro. He obviously understands it as an insult, and not just any insult, a racist insult.

Yet I am adding to the chorus of native speakers that say that the world ""negro"" is merely descriptive, even if it is followed by an insult. The English speaking world is constantly thrown off by the way Spanish speakers use physical, racial and national descriptors in ways that would be considered unecessary, borderline offensive or flat racist if used in exactly the same way in English.

For example, in Spanish it is very common to describe somebody by their place of origin. So you might hear something like ""Eto'o scored in the match, the African is playing well"". Mentioning that he's African might sound a bit strange in english, even gratuitous, but in Spanish it's completely normal and we do the same thing with physical characteristics. Calling somebody skinny or fat, or referring to them by their hair color, or even skin color is considered simply descriptive. Like in English you might say ""take it easy, kid"" or even ""fuck you, kid"" we would just as easily say ""tranquilo, negro"" or even ""a tomar por culo, negro"", in both cases the negro part is just a neutral description, not part of an insult.

It's hard to explain, and it's obvious to me that most native English speakers simply unable or unwilling to see the difference, but while I don't know how Luis Suarez feels about black people, I strongly believe that simply calling Evra black is not a racist insult in Spanish.",0,1325618780,null,0,false,0,c3dltxr,t3_o08zf,t1_c3dltxr,t3_o08zf,null,1428118010,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

On the other hand I respect the club for just letting it go. No doubt the appeal would have failed, due to the FA wanting to make a point about not accepting (alleged) racism and showing up UEFA and FIFA. So it would have just resulted in a longer ban no doubt. 

Suarez will have to deal with being tarnished as a racist now from those too stupid to not understand the ins and outs of what happened. Which no player deserves. 

I hope this doesn't effect him or make him want to leave the league (I wouldn't blame him tbh). Lets hope the time out is good for him and when he returns he's better than ever.

In summary, I understand that you are saying that:
&gt;since they [trains]  were privatized, the service is better, but this seems to be heavily dependent on what lines your using and when.

based on your going to Birmingham on holiday as a child. 

As a regular train user for the last 20 years, my personal experiance is that trains now on many lines as are delapidated as they were 20 years ago (its sometimes even the same rolling stock... so its 20 years more delapidated...), there is less diversity of service as small stations have been closed as they are not profitable for the tender holder, prices have rocketed as the built in price escalator (part of the tender agreement) kicks in year on year, and the infrastructure continues to suffer from horrendous underfunding as its 'not the problem' of the tender owners - its Network Rail's problem, who get their after the tendees have paid out their investors, and then been subsidised by central governement. 

Paying out the investors? yeah, that 11% per year (I could be wrong - I recall its around that amount) that gets taken out of the pot (both ticket revenue, and tax based contributions to support public services) to pay the investors, (who simply 'risked' their money on fronting up enough cash to buy the fucking trains from the public from that witch Thatcher, not really building / investing much other than transferable pots of cash) could be going on infrastructure, more trains, and less of an obsession with fudging punctuality figures and endless excuses for broken/limping trains. Fuck every single thing about PPP, PFI or whatever name they want to hide the great public resrouces swindle of the past few decades under today.  

I'm ranting I know, but I wanted to demonstrate that there is scant few indicators one can use to demonstrate that privatisation has been a good a thing the general public wrt to train travel. Even the punctuality figures talk to the post privatisation period, comparing what was initially diabolical perfomance with the marginaly improved (as long as its not snowing, or too hot, or too windy, or a bank holiday, or anytime I needed to be on time...)

Personally my parents used to repair watches and most were sold online to the US via ebay, which I assume would go if SOPA was around since plenty of illegitimate things can be sold there. If SOPA had rolled out its idiocy back then they wouldn't have been able to sell many at all. The sales they made were taxed, and the money they spent was also subject to the usual taxes, so they were putting money into the economy that wouldn't have gone in otherwise.

Similarly we could hypothesise that the UK government would follow suit with a similar law, along with others in the EU.

&gt; 
&gt; In summary, I understand that you are saying that:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; since they [trains] were privatized, the service is better, but this seems to be heavily dependent on what lines your using and when.
&gt;
&gt; based on your going to Birmingham on holiday as a child. 

No, this isn't the case. I've used the train on a regular basis my entire life, especially as my mother (who cannot drive) remarried (to a man who cannot drive), and promptly moved 200 miles from our nearest family. So we had to use to train to go any distance, and often went on vacations/day trips all over the country in addition to visiting family members. I've never bothered to learn to drive, all every job I've had (barring McJobs as a youth) I've had to commute to via train (often involving multiple trains). So I would say I've used the train quite heavily for 30ish years now. And for the record, I've never set foot in Birmingham beyond the limits of the taxi taxi rank while smoking.

So when I say that cost is a big issue, something that has definitely got worse over the years to the far side of ridicule I don't think we disagree.

However, when it comes to the quality of the service that is highly variable depending on the location. For instance around Manchester the trains are terrible, mostly seeming to be converted buses on bogies. And from what I gather they were supposed to be a quick fix decades ago and I have no idea why they are still in service. Around the Midlands, especially the Derby/Crewe line the trains are always being canceled or running late, and are always filthy. The Reading/Gatwick line is the same, and always seems to be filled to the point of being dangerous, especially as there are apparently no restrictions on bikes which leads to 5-6 people trying to bring full sized mountain bikes on peak hour trains. The only upside is the reaction to not having a ticket appears to be being ignored by the guard so you can travel for free on much of this line (pro-tip, if you arrive at Reading without a ticket, claim you boarded at Reading West, and the machine wouldn't accept your card, the ticket is less than £2). 

But the Virgin cross country service is far better than the similar services of my youth. The trains are clean, quiet, comfortable and I've not had many issues with delays on that line, which I used quite often to travel from the vicinity of Reading up to Crewe/Manchester where my GF used to live). They can get overcrowded on the weekends, but if your careful with timing you can avoid this and more often than not First Class has free seats. And the Waterloo/Southampton line I use on a near daily basis to get to work never seems to have issues either. Which is different from what I remember as a youth on the same line under BR, with the slam door trains which always seemed to have issues every time I went up to London. The rolling stock is relatively new, clean, comfortable and the service is very regular meaning that I can get a train every 20mins or so. The only problem with that line is that Brockenhurst seemed to cause constant problems a few winters back. 

So in my experience, the quality of service you get from the trains does vary considerably depending on the line in question. I've done many a journey up to the Manchester area via London and Reading which have been flawless, even when it involves the tube. And as much as I hate to admit this, even changing at New Street isn't that bad these days. The only real problem I've had on that journey was being stuck at Stafford for 2 hours late at night due to a suicide. 

I'm not saying it's perfect, it has a lot of problems that privatization has either caused or exacerbated, but I do honestly think that simply nationalizing the rail network isn't going to be a magic bullet. Most of the issues seems to be a direct result of the traditional British approach to regulation, which seems to have angry letters and 50p fines as the harshest measures it can impose. And I'm damn sure that if we gave the regulators the ability to take the gloves off when required things could dramatically improve under the current system, and if the firms don't like it we can simply take back the ownership of the services when their contracts expire rather than actively taking them away.

true,Womjack,null,null,"hmmmm - the only reason the trial isn't ""fair"" is because of police incompetence at the time leading to no trial at the time in spite of heavy evidence against them. Also - the defendants attitude throughout. I say again - the defendants disgusting attitude throughout the 18 years. This meant that while all the evidence points towards them being guilty it was a matter of bad procedure etc that they weren't imprisoned before. The ""fairness"" is relative to the past events and the result of past trials etc.

You could say that after 18 years if there was a lot of compelling evidence to suggest they were innocent then there has been plenty of time for it to come out. If that had been the case then this trial could have been seen as unfair because they would have been biased towards aquittal.

I guess what I'm saying is that in the face of 18 years of this - the bias maybe represents the facts and the frustration over the length of time for justice.

If we drew a parallel with a wrongfully imprisoned person -- say they have been in prison for 18 years - and the appeal trial is not ""fair"" but biased towards their pardon - maybe this is representative of considered public opinion and facts rather than the knee-jerk reaction often implied by an ""unfair"" trial.

If the CoE *itself* was not in decline then they would be shouting about it from the rooftops.

I can well believe that evangelical churches are on the rise - but they're not the CoE and nor does it mean overall that religious adherence is on the rise. It's not and various polls and studies have been showing that for years. Consider the BSA statistics: 50% say ""No religion"" and bearing in mind the general confusing over whether one is a cultural and practicing religious person, I would say that non-religious (by which I mean they are religious only in a cultural sense) are now in the majority in the UK.

In the last decade or so you might have noticed that many different religious groups are 'coming together' and calling on the government etc. to pay more attention to faith and what not. Inter-faith committees and what not, telling us all how important we (ought to) think religion is. The idea is that 'some faith' is better than no faith, which is why these groups are also rather grumpy towards secularism in very much a ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" type way. If secularism wins out, then all religions lose their automatic power. Guaranteed if there weren't such apathy towards religion in general or most people were religious, then these groups would not be so chummy.

Smaller or less influential religions such as Islam bolster the position of the CoE in government because it is in their interest to have *some* religious influence in parliament rather than none.

I completely agree that re-nationalisation is no magic bullet - even as was (pre-privatiations) there are pro/cons for public usage (cost, regularity, cleanliness, service coverage etc), however, I strongly feel that the pendulum has swung far to faw away from a public services that must encounter lossy lines because its a public service, towards the horribly selfish and amoral private business it has become. And its time to start swinging that pendulum back towards the consumer. 

Seat prices are worked out not at actual cost plus some defensable profit for upgrade, but by comparing the cost to travel by car, and charging marginally less. This significantly reduces the proposed orginal benefit of cheap mass transit. Its means that mass transit is considered to be in competion with cars, not being delivered with a public benefit centric ethos. This is a false paradigm, as trains are not cars, cities have reduced capacity for car management (flow, parking etc) and so to compare the two is somewhat skewing in favour of raised seat prices. 

I also agree that some cross country services are improved. But that was a one of thing by virgin when they took over the franchise, and it was a built in part of the tender. Since those improvements have been made to thier rolling stock how much extra investment have seen in stock levels and carriage re-fits?

Private eye magazine has the most indepth analysis of trains in the UK I have read, they keep a constant eye on the grubby wheelings and dealings of the private operators. And rightly so. My previous operator are one of the worst offenders for shirking out of contractual obligations, offering guff and bluster as a justification for crappy service and blatently lying about train cancelations where its cheaper for them to do so. 

And finally I completely agree with the regulator being the missing link in all this mess. We had an imperfect system that was replaced with another imperfect systems, whose imperfections simple lever public money and ticket money out of the system. If we had regulators that even occasionally growled, let alone barked at or bit the operators we might have the benefits that where sold to the public at the time of privatisation.

true,redem,,Ballymena,"&gt; I read lots of accounts by unionists/Orange Order/etc. that accused the Garvaghy Road community of ""bussing people in"" to make the nationalist protest look bigger than it was (this was a complaint almost every year) - do you think this was the case? Or were most nationalists who were protesting Garvaghy residents? Things are so often a he-said-she-said in NI!

Why is this even a complaint? Every damn one of the orangemen was ""bussed in"", yet they complain if the residents have any support from outside the area? Yeeesh, hypocrisy much?

&gt; I also spoke with many protesters to the banning who were on the Hill with the Orangemen who said that (prior to 1998 and the deaths of the Quinn brothers) the standoff was actually quite good craic each July - it was like a summer campout sort of thing. Do you think nationalists ever had the same sense, or were things always 100% serious on that side?

I have no direct knowledge of this, but I suspect it was tolerated fatalistically prior to these events. In a ""couldn't change it if I wanted to"" sort of way. That attitude seemed prevalent in many nationalist areas.

And secondly much of our rail network was actually built by private sector firms, competing with each other for every customer.

I saw the game and it wasnt horrific it wasnt a 6-1 defeat.

Plus they also got rights for nearly same day (as UK) broadcasting. Before this, new Who was only on Syfy in US or in repeats on BBCA. Syfy didn't bother to promote the show. Before BBCA picked it up again, I think most of us watched new eps on-line or caught up on DVD's. When BBCA got their broadcast rights, they also got their highest ratings ever (until S5 premiere) with the End of Time, and realized the existing fanbase they could cultivate in the US now that they actually had something to promote. so between the end of Tennant's era and ""The 11th Hour"" they pulled out all the media and promotional stops and have been pushing it heavily ever since. not a surprise of course, they want the ratings, but i think i know how you feel. it does often feel like BBCA purposely ignores everything that came before the Moffat era. hence we get specials like ""Best of Doctor Who: the monsters"" and then discover the whole hour is only Matt Smith's era.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Alright, Doctor Who ran from 1963-1989 then rebooted in 2005. By no means do I suggest you start at 1963. You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor.

I was surprised that the full-backs and the wingers didn't overlap more, especially during the final 30 when Downing was on the right. That really allowed the center backs to collapse on Carroll, who did fairly well given the circumstances around him. 

Agree that 4-3-3 doesn't work. Who would like to see a return of th e3-5-2? Having Carragher back to organize the defense might be useful and allow Enrique, Agger and Johnson to get forward more.
