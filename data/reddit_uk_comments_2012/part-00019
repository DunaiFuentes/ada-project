true,pikeybastard,null,null,"This is all part of why the current political process stinks, but it isn't just confined to Cameron. On the day that he called the General Election Gordon Brown visited the town where I live (Gillingham/Rainham in Kent), and my friends and I thought it would be interesting to see the PM, even if only from a distance, as he was stopping off at a house on the road next to my friend's. We went down and after a 20 minute wait he arrived at the house that he was meant to be 'visiting' of an average joe voter, who just so happened to be a member of the local labour party.

There were about 40 people there most of whom booed when he got out the car, as unemployment had skyrocketed in parts of the area in the previous year. A man from ITV (I overheard him saying that he was from ITN anyway, which produces much of their news), accompanying the cameraman and soundman told the soundman to 'turn the sound off'. Several taxis pulled up and out popped labour supporters not from the local area. Brown got out of the car again, the guy who I guess was a producer or something said 'turn the sound back on' and they (the ferried in supporters) all cheered. In the meantime, a man who had shouted 'unemployed' when Gordon asked the watching people how they were was told 'to leave before we call the police or we move you on' by a couple of intimidating men in suits. Brown went into the house 'for lunch', came out 4 or 5 minutes later, spoke to 'the locals' who had got out of the taxis or private cars (not sure), some of whom were carrying labour placards and clapping, he was filmed by several news crews talking to a 'local young family', and flatly ignored all questions put to him by actual local people, apart from one question over stamp duty to which he responded 'Tory question' and that was it.

The guys with the camera came over a bit later and asked us to say a few things about the visit and whether we'd be voting for Labour in the election. When my friend said no, as they had introduced tuition fees and would likely raise them again when the Browne report was in, and would vote Lib Dem (irony eh? :p) the guy with the clipboard laughed, said 'students', told the cameraman to stop rolling and to 'junk it'. Brown drove off, followed by the media cacophony and party apparatchiks, one of whom asked their friend what the next 'stop' was, leaving behind a couple of dozen remaining very pissed off people. On the news that night the way that the visit was shown bore no relation to anything at all that I or my friends had seen that day.

I think we have a real systemic problem in this country regarding the media's relationship with politicians, the attitude that politicians take to the general public, and with the lack of access that the public has to it's political actors.

Sorry if this was long and boring, thought it would be of interest within the context of Cameron's behaviour!

Here are a couple of phone pics from the day- couldn't take more than 2 as I and a few people around me were asked to stop snapping or filming for 'security reasons', which may or may not be BS, who knows.  I hope the quality is alright:

Right now, there's a strong religious belief in incentives. Of course there are problems with some of the incentives in our society - there always will be because no finite set of comprehensible rules will ever reflect the complexity the human condition. But in some circles, repeating naive dogma about incentives is a key social norm. If you don't advocate incentives as the magic solution for everything, or you show any signs of doubt, you can't be one of them.

Consider the novel *Lungbarrow* (which I've never read), but is notable for making startling revelations about the Doctor's origins, his history and his past. It's highly unlikely that the TV show will ever go into that level of backstory (for fear of simply giving away the character), but Steven Moffat seems to have his own *Lungbarrow* idea (""Doctor *who*?""). 

I'd imagine that *if* Moffat makes some revelations about who the Doctor really is, and *if* they contradict what was set out in *Lungbarrow*, then whatever the actual episode itself presents would take precedence over what *Lungbarrow* claimed were the Doctor's origins.

&gt; They should give me the evidence as requested as I am not going to court without it.

I'm not a lawyer and this does not constitute legal advice. Your best bet is a lawyer specialising in this kind of case.

If you don't heed this advice then, assuming you're in magistrates court, I would suggest just asking for the evidence when you attend court.

I have tended to wear blue collar (i.e. clean denim, conservative jeans and top) rather than a shirt and tie. I think this presents a more ""down to earth"" and ""less pretentious"" image.

I would then ask, at the earliest opportunity, to see the evidence. Magistrates seem to be very accommodating of those who are unrepresented but who present themselves as wanting to be straight-forward and understand what's going on. So if I were asked ""how do you plead?"", for example, I would respond, ""I don't know, I have some questions about the evidence, please"". This immediately places the defendant into the role of *someone who needs help* - the help of navigating the legal system, in the first instance. 

I would explain that I obviously can't remember a specific occasion weeks or months ago, and that it's possible I might have crept over the speed limit on a time or two (the question ""who hasn't?"" is left implied), but that I would never knowingly speed as much as 30mph over. I would explain that *this* is why I want to see the evidence, and this is why I want to ask about calibration. I would expect the court to be able to adjourn (for some weeks or months) so that you can then consider this evidence.

I think calibration is a really interesting defence, and I think it's a *very* long way from having been fully explored in British law. When I got stopped by two plod with a radar gun I specifically asked about this sort of thing (availability of source code, in fact) and for the make, model and serial number of the radar gun equipment. I never received a ticket or summons for this incident. On another occasion the local council backed down over evidence of having sent me council tax bills, rather than pursue me for court costs, even whilst maintaining that they didn't need proof of postage or delivery (that they claim to have put the letter in the mail is supposedly evidence enough).

I *think* the correct way to get calibration information is to file a freedom of information request. I think you should probably initiate this ASAP.",0,1329677800,null,0,false,0,c3stu8q,t3_pw9v5,t1_c3stu8q,t1_c3ssiwu,null,1428382723,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Paul McGann is official, in that he's definitely the Eighth Doctor. But if you want to ignore the half-human bit, go for it. If you want to ignore the entire movie's existence, go for it. If you love it, then great.

One of the comics (""The Forgotten"") states that he used a Chameleon Arch to fake being half-human to trick the Doctor. Some of the books state he has simply absorbed some human DNA by regenerating around them all the time, and some simply say he's got a human mum who was biffed by a Time Lord.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"You might get stung on VAT, but to be honest if you're not making a lot from it then you probably won't need to register. I've been thinking about this and I think it's an absolutely stonking idea for rural communities with elderly populations. It's the type of social enterprise that really is needed too. The type of services I've come up with so far:

* Delivering the last mile of food shopping
* Handling postage
* Reselling phone and internet connectivity (for those that want it)
* Offering to take groups of people (social transport) to and from town several days a week
* Helping people switch utilities (you'd get a kickback on the switching site, they'd get cheaper utility costs)
* Helping people book train tickets, bus tickets etc.

Of the above I'd say the only one you couldn't do straight away would be the social transport. If you get something like Amazon Prime you can act as an Amazon distribution point as well with free next day postage.

I know a lot of elderly people in my mum's village struggle with things like travel, so having someone to help arrange train and bus tickets, and transfers to and from the station would really help their mobility. I think if you can set up a few different revenue streams, especially via kickbacks then there's an opportunity to really help people while getting paid for it.

Now to answer you question - depending on what you do you might need (or want) to register as a company, but I wouldn't do that until you're at the point where you're making enough money to do this full time. You might want to get a separate bank account set up to run everything through just so it's nice and clean compared to your personal stuff and then your statements should give you good enough records of what's going in and out.

I'd seriously consider the Amazon prime thing - just charge £2 per item and take it round locally.

Yes, he gave away some passes, but he was playing quite deep and while he executed a lot of hopeful, low-percentage passes, when they did connect, they made a huge impact. Perhaps he could be a bit more economical in his passing, but considering how Spearing has struggled to pass in anything resembling forward direction, I hope we start Adam in the Carling Cup final. 

Another problem that Adam had in the first half was that Henderson was often horribly out of position (something else Spearing struggles with). This often left Adam surrounded by 5 opposing players with no outlet, as Henderson was nowhere to be found.

&gt;  It seemed to be an emotionally based decision and was rather unprofessional.

I see your point, but I think if you look at it as a singular match and ignore the rest of the season (hard to do, I admit), his performance warranted a chance for a goal, especially given the scoreline. I'm sure he spent most of the week in the shit with the management, so I think it was good we gave him that. I could be wrong, though.

In an ideal world, let's say we buy Hazard and keep the other two at the club instead of sending them on loan again. We now have 3 wingers, 1 senior and 2 still learning their trade to a certain extent. Add to that a certain Lucas Piazon, who will probably stay at the club. 4 Wingers, even though there may be a bias towards the left, we had the same situation in the glory days of Robben and Duff and frankly, watching them switch flanks and cut in on their stronger foot and defences simply couldn't cope. I want to see that again, and I think we can do it

This moves Mata into the advanced central midfield role, with Sturridge moving in to the centre forward position. Assuming Didier goes that leaves us with Torres, Lukaku and Sturridge

Midfield is a huge concern to me, as is RB. I don't think anyone we have is world class. Ramires is a grafter but he is not technical enough. Clearing out some midfield deadweight and spending money here would be wise. As for RB, we have Iva as cover and a starting RB should be purchased

Ins: Hazard, Sneijder (one can dream), a RB, Kakuta and De Bruyne from loan

Leaves us with a pretty good looking squad, but crucially one that has variation and creativity and pace.

In a way I'm also concerned that a single presenter runs the risk of doing what Mock the Week has - I'm a fan of all of the current permanent Mock stars (and most of the often repeating guests) - but the last series or two has felt very samey - and the few new guests doing the show barely seem to get a word in. It's funny still, but I can predict where a lot of it might go and it can all seem very familiar week after week.

I'm not quite sure HIGNFY would get stuck quite the same - it's always involved the team guests more, and it worked brilliantly when Deayton was regular host - but I'm not sure they've got anyone like Deayton (or could replace him) yet. Most of the best candidates for permanent host are comedians who often seem to get a little too involved in the banter parts and/or struggle to keep control. Armstrong always delivers a strong show but not always the most exciting, and in many ways I feel you need more of a straight man then complete comedian. (Some of the actors hosting have been very good IMO).

Andy had a really good game, but I'd like to see him fight for the ball a little more. In the first half he started to go down pretty easily after some calls did not go his way. I'd rather see him giving away fouls in the opposition's box than sitting on the ground with his hands up. He also needs to take his chances a little better, should've hit the target when he headed Gerrard's cross. One thing I loved though, after Gerrard fluffed that counter, Andy came sprinting back full speed and won the ball back with a tackle.

Some people had enough insight as far back as the 60's and 70's about how things were going with industrial civilisation. Even back at the beginning of the 1900's I think some people could see that getting so besotted with oil was going to lead to trouble. 

Thinking that changing the way energy is provided by moving to renewables will be our salvation is a pipe dream either way seeing as the species does nothing so well as denial. 

I guess you've seen this - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOMWzjrRiBg

If humans assume they can somehow continue with business as usual and just switch to waves and sun and wind, we will get nowhere. Or at least we are flirting with disaster. How exactly are we going to replace infrastructure that has been built since the Industrial Revolution in the space of a decade or two with technology that doesn't really exist? 

If you are still here, I don't think there is any rational process here. No one in a position to make a change is going to do it because the truths they would have to be aware of are too difficult for them to realise and too unpalatable to speak. 

Technology is peripheral. In a rational world, if they built a wave power generator in the 60's we would have a better one now but in this world OPEC would have killed it (or actually, it was BNFL IIRC) for reasons of greed. 

When we destroy we become destroyed.

The real problem though is that if they dropped the limit to 60, there was probably a reason like road-works, and they really don't like you speeding near workmen. So work out where you were stopped - were you near the roadworks, or just in the half mile or more where they are trying to get traffic to slow down?

This will all happen in our lifetime, and it won't be pretty. Because the solutions are things no one wants to hear - lower population; local, (rather than mass) manufacture and farming, no throwaway goods, no fashion industry, no pensions, no NHS, no dole, no drug industry (including contraception), no mass personalised transport. The Americans, in particular, are completely screwed.

There will be war and suffering the likes of which no one has ever seen, as everyone tries to grab an ever decreasing slice of the pie, but there will be an end to it in the long run. If we invest in a grid, and renewables, now, the collapse wont take as as far down the technological ladder as it otherwise will. Plastics can be made from cellulose, paper can be made from hemp. Other options exist that the video doesn't explore, but then again, they only had 30 minutes.

true,Podwangler,null,null,"Anyway, let's poke the holes in your argument. Firstly, you clearly don't understand the way that private landlords work in London. They don't use mortgages. most of them already have enough liquid capital to buy properties cash, which instantly makes the property an asset without interest. They divide the property into small but expensive single room bedsits, studios and single bedroom flats to maximise profits and then make a killing, often making back the purchase price within the first few years. Your argument about setting prices to pay mortgages only holds for small scale landlords making an initial or secondary investment, most of whom (unless they already hold private fortuunes) don't have the liquid capital to even start to move into London to buy properties.

And I'm sorry if you don't like the idea that the greed of a few rancorous individuals is destroying everything that used to be good about britain. If those companies want to leave the UK, then my words are ""Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out."" As if companies would cut off billions in profit just to spite the UK for taxing them or capping rents. People like you predicted the end of the world as we know it with practical armaggeddon for small and medium sized businesses if the Labour govt brought in a minimum wage. They did, and it didn't.

[*Shepherd Neame is the local big brewery and owns 50%+ of the pubs in Canterbury. Annoyingly its ales are pretty fucking awful (excepting Whitstable Bay in the summer) and it loves the lager Oranjeboom which is appalling.*]


**The Dolphin** (I work here, so bias beware) - Big, good food portions and good collection of ales, also the best pub garden in Canterbury: £££££

**The Parrot** - Used to be amazing as Simple Simons, Shepherd Neame have cocked it up a fair bit but still has a nice outdoor section and a lot of character. Mediocre food and drinks: ££££

**The City Arms** - Normally overlooked as it's next to the busy pub Caseys but has great food and a lot of charm. Expensive though: £££££

**The Millers Arms** - Standard pub, popular but I never really see why. Great room with a fire: ££££

**Bramleys** - *Hispter* is a vague term, but this is the closest Canterbury comes to the idea. Cocktail deals on thursday (?) are always worth it though &amp; good pool table. Lots of character, good staff: £££££

**The White Hart** - Great pub garden for the summer and good pub food. Horribly expensive for a Neame pub though: £££££

**The Foundry** - Used to work the bar here a long time ago, now it's run by an exciting group of guys who've set up a microbrewery on the ground-floor. Unfortunately overshadowed by The Cherry Tree up the road, their in-house brews are awesome and they do great pies: ££££

**The Cherry Tree** - Crazy pub does the infamous drink *'The Pig Fucker'*. All sorts of people in Canterbury end up there at some point and eventually get thrown out. Good laugh though: £££

**The Bell &amp; Crown** - Walk past here in the afternoon to see Canterbury's selection of middle-aged alcoholics. Really traditional landlord and good staff, beers and grub. Spills out on to Palace Street which these days isn't too bad a thing: £££

**The Thomas Becket** - Good pub for a board game and a beer. If my pubs full I always direct people their way: ££££

**The Canterbury Tales** - Late license, tend to see other pubhands here for a drink after work. Tatty and run-down, the landlord is a great character and the crowd is always good; £££

**The Lady Luck** - Never been here, but I hear it's good for the alternative crowd: £?

**The Black Griffin** - Used to be the Hobgoblin but recently renovated, does some gigs. Haven't been there enough for a solid opinion: ££££

**Top/Bottom Wetherspoons** - One at either end of town, full of all the scum and students you expect to see. If you enjoy a cheap pint of Stella in a sea of sweat, piss and sick, you know where to go: £

**The Penny Theatre** - It's a Scream Bar and with a yellow card you can get £1 pints (one day of the week I can't remember). Used to be an institution and put on gigs but those days are long gone. Always rammed: £

Trophies are great and it's what every player dreams of, but in order for this club to go forward in to the future, we must have Champions League football. The income it provides, the calibre of player it attracts, the global exposure it gives the club. These things are critical. 

I think it will be very tough, but it's certainly possible. Brighton is a mid-table Championship team, so I'm not going overboard in my praise, but we must start to show that level of dominance and control against weaker teams. Tottenham (lacks depth at key positions), Arsenal (concedes too many goals), Newcastle and Chelsea (both seem to have lost the plot) all have vulnerabilities. We simply cannot drop points to those weaker sides.

 I would rather lose 1-5 to a strong team than see us play Wigan to a 0-0 draw. We've got to get stronger and play with some purpose. 

We were horribly outplayed against United last weekend. Our midfield was absolutely woeful and the scoreline was really kind to us, we were that bad.

true,NameOnTheInterwebs,present,Ricardo Carvalho,"This.  There was a sudden change from the team's spirit and confidence.  Most of our central players like Drogba, Essien, and Lamps have not had the same fire displayed in certain occasions.  The sentiment that we used to bare our teeth until the final whistle somehow no longer applies.

I remember our Stoke City game last season when we had to go back from a 1-0 score to win *in stoppage time*.  I remember the two Liverpool CL games.  This is the Chelsea that we love.

Somehow, I find it easy to blame Scolari for breaking up the team.  Everyone else that followed had to worry about controlling the dressing room more than focusing on tactics to win important games.

But more than anything else, I am utterly dismayed by the support we provide the lads in The Shed End.  The cries and booing directed either at the team or the manager *in Stamford Bridge* is something I will never ever understand.  This is home.  This is where we should be getting nothing but support 110% **all the time**.

Mind you, it's interesting to note that the areas that we could imagine bending towards racism and sexism are also the groups who are homophobic. Maybe I'm straw-manning - someone let me know.

With regards to ""unnatural"": That's something to always make sure is clear when you're talking to an apparent homophobe btw: Very often people think ""homosexuality"" = ""having sex with someone of the same gender"". That seems to be a common thought, that homosexuality is *all* about gay sex. Watch any debate or discussion on the issue where the opposition call it unnatural or base, and consider that they're *simply* talking about sex acts. That would be one of the main reasons particular groups are against gay marriage. In their mind marriage gives the OK for sexual relations (yeah...) and as such ""gay marriage"" = ""OK to gay sex"", which is something they can't bring themselves to allow.

That's by the by and the ""unnatural"" argument is so easily dismissed (~1,500 species exhibit gay tendencies) that I'm yet to see a decent retort.

Ninety-eight per cent of young gay people hear the phrases ""that's so gay"" or ""you're so gay"" in school – and anecdotal evidence suggests the terminology is used as freely in workplaces around the country.

I had a conversation on facebook recently (with a now ex-'friend') about his comment after a football match, along the lines of ""Have that you hammer gays!... note: gay is not used in an offensive way.""

I replied with a quote from Simon Amstell:

&gt; [Katy Perry also recorded the song ""You're so gay"". It sounds homophobic, but of course she's using the other, fashionable meaning of the word meaning 'anything generally bad'. And anyone who thinks that's offensive should just Jew off. And stop being so bloody black about it.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjmhhpkmPig)

and asked him what meaning he meant exactly.

What followed was infuriating, with numerous people dropping by to tell me I should ""take my PC agenda elsewhere"". I said I wasn't ""offended"" by their remarks, in an effort to steer the conversation away from ""You're just looking to get upset about something!"" (I think the O word is overdone and it's far too subjective to be useful in any way) trying to get them to acknowledge that it's insulting to a whole demographic to use the label for their sexuality as a derogatory term.

They couldn't understand that why I'd have a problem with it: ""How is it hurting anyone?"". It wasn't aimed at gay people directly, he wasn't trying to offend gay people: If he wasn't being expressly homophobic in the first place then what's the problem? To try and make these guys understand that they are using a word that is synonymous with ""homosexual"" to mean ""bad"" - What if they were to replace it with ""black""? ""But that'd be racist! That's not the same at all!"". 

Do you ever get the impression people don't want to think too hard? To state that ""it doesn't mean ""homosexual"" anymore!"" ... Brick wall. Utter incomprehension on the part of the 'middle' class straight men. (Oh which I am one.)

By no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv). You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

And even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor.

While I do agree that Carroll will be coming into form soon, him being in the team changes us from a quick passing  through the middle team to a pass to the wing to cross it into the box team. I feel like the team we used to be was more reliable in terms of goals. If Carroll is having a bad day, goals will be hard to come by.

Edit: If we do happen to get Podolski, I expect a 4-3-3.

He didn't score but he did play a part. 

The second goal, where Suarez wonderfully controlled the ball, do you remember the chaos in the box that allowed him the space? Watch it again and see who is sitting on top of two Brighton defenders in the box. Carroll.

The 3rd goal was fantastic, created by Downing, but the finish was anything but straightforward, Carroll clipping it in, reminsicent of Rush.

He had nothing to do with the 4th or 5th Liverpool goals, but it was his header back across the box that set up Suarezz for the 6th.

Above all else, what Carroll brings is a huge distraction for opposition defenders and keepers in the box. It is often this that allows others to score. 

I haven't even mentioned how useful he is in the air defensively. Brighton are a decent side, playing in a very physical league, and Carroll tortured them all day long. Did you see the amount of grabbing, hugging and shoving that they had to resort to to try to stop him?

16 Feb 2012 : Column 1016

Lord James of Blackheath: My Lords, I hope the minute that that has taken has not come off my time. I do not wish noble Lords to get too encouraged when I start with my conclusions but I will not sit down when I have made them. I will then give the evidence to support them and, I hope, present the reasons why I want support for an official inquiry into the mischief I shall unfold this afternoon. I have been engaged in pursuit of this issue for nearly two years and I am no further forward in getting to the truth.

There are three possible conclusions which may come from it. First, there may have been a massive piece of money-laundering committed by a major Government who should know better. Effectively, it undermined the integrity of a British bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland, in doing so. The second possibility is that a major American department has an agency which has gone rogue on it because it has been wound up and has created a structure out of which it is seeking to get at least €50 billion as a pay-off. The third possibility is that this is an extraordinarily elaborate fraud, which has not been carried out, but which has been prepared to provide a threat to one Government or more if they do not make a pay-off. These three possibilities need an urgent review.

In April and May 2009, the situation started with the alleged transfer of $5 trillion to HSBC in the United Kingdom. Seven days later, another $5 trillion came to HSBC and three weeks later another $5 trillion. A total of $15 trillion is alleged to have been passed into the hands of HSBC for onward transit to the Royal Bank of Scotland. We need to look to where this came from and the history of this money. I have been trying to sort out the sequence by which this money has been created and where it has come from for a long time.

It starts off apparently as the property of Yohannes Riyadi, who has some claims to be considered the richest man in the world. He would be if all the money that was owed to him was paid but I have seen some accounts of his showing that he owns $36 trillion in a bank. It is a ridiculous sum of money. However, $36 trillion would be consistent with the dynasty from which he comes and the fact that it had been effectively the emperors of Indo-China in times gone by. A lot of that money has been taken away from him, with his consent, by the American Treasury over the years for the specific purpose of helping to support the dollar.

Mr Riyadi has sent me a remarkable document dated February 2006 in which the American Government have called him to a meeting with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which is neither the Federal Reserve nor a bank. It is a bit like “Celebrity Big Brother”. It has three names to describe it and none of them is true. This astonishing document purports to have been a meeting, which was witnessed by Mr Alan Greenspan, who signed for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York of which he was chairman, as well as chairman of the real Federal Reserve in Washington. It is signed by Mr Timothy Geithner as a witness on behalf of the International Monetary Fund. The IMF sent two witnesses, the other being Mr Yusuke Horiguchi. These gentlemen have signed as witnesses to the effect

16 Feb 2012 : Column 1017

that this deal is a proper deal. There are a lot of other signatures on the document. I do not have a photocopy; I have an original version of the contract.

Under the contract, the American Treasury has apparently got the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to offer to buy out the bonds issued to Mr Riyadi to replace the cash which has been taken from him over the previous 10 years. It is giving him $500 million as a cash payment to buy out worthless bonds. That is all in the agreement and it is very remarkable. Establishing whether I have a correct piece of paper is just two phone calls away-one to Mr Geithner and one to Mr Greenspan, both of whom still prosper and live. They could easily confirm whether they signed it. Mr Riyadi, by passing these bonds over, has also put at the disposal of the US Treasury the entire asset backing which he was alleged to have for the $15 trillion. I have a letter from the Bank of Indonesia which says that the whole thing was a pack of lies. He did not have the 750,000 tonnes of gold which was supposed to be backing it; he had only 700 tonnes. This is a piece of complete fabrication.

 

Finally, I have a letter from Mr Riyadi himself, who tells me that he was put up to do this, that none of it is true, and that he has been robbed of all his money. I am quite prepared to recognise that one of the possibilities is that Mr Riyadi is himself putting this together as a forgery in order to try to win some recovery. But it gets more complicated than that because each of the $5 trillion payments that came in has been acknowledged and receipted by senior executives at HSBC and again receipted by senior executives at the Royal Bank of Scotland. I have a set of receipts for all of this money. Why would any bank want to file $5 trillion-worth-$15 trillion in total-of receipts if the money did not exist? The money was first said to have come from the Riyadi account to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and from there it was passed to JP MorganChase in New York for onward transit to London. The means of sending it was a SWIFT note which, if it was genuine, ought to have been registered with the Bank of England.

When this came about, I took it to my noble friend Lord Strathclyde and asked what we should do with it. He said, “Give it to Lord Sassoon. He is the Treasury”. So I did, and my noble friend Lord Sassoon looked at it and said immediately, “This is rubbish. It is far too much money. It would stick out like a sore thumb and you cannot see it in the Royal Bank of Scotland accounts”. He went on to say, “The gold backing it is ridiculous. Only 1,507 tonnes of gold has been mined in the history of the world, so you cannot have 750,000 tonnes”. That is true. The third thing he said was, “It is a scam”, and I agree with him. The problem is that at that point we stopped looking, but we should have asked what the scam was instead of just nodding it off.

We have never resolved it. Today, I have this quite frightening piece of paper, which is my justification for bringing it into this meeting. It is available on the internet and I am astonished that it has not already been unearthed by the Treasury because every alarm bell in the land should be ringing if it has. It is from the general audit office of the Federal Reserve in Washington-the real Federal Reserve-and its audit

16 Feb 2012 : Column 1018

review to the end of July 2010 on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It has on it some 20 banks listed to which $16.115 trillion is outstanding in loans. That is the sore thumb that was being looked for by my noble friend Lord Sassoon. But more particularly there are two other interesting things. The first is that Barclays Bank has $868 billion of loan, and the Royal Bank of Scotland has $541 billion, in which case one has to ask a question, because they could have earned back in three weeks their entire indebtedness and could pay off the taxpayers of Britain. Why have they not done so and could we please ask them to put a cheque in the post tonight for the whole $46 billion?

The next thing that is wrong with it is that every bank on this list, without exception, is an MTN-registered bank, which means that they are registered to use medium-term notes to move funds between themselves with an agreed profit-share formula, in which case these banks are investing this money and, most extraordinarily, not a penny of interest does the Federal Bank of New York want paid on that vast amount, $16 trillion. Anyone who knows what the IMF rules are will immediately smell a rat. The IMF has very strict rules for validating dodgy money. There are two ways of doing it. You either pass it through a major central bank like the Bank of England, which apparently refused to touch this, or you put it through an MTN-trading bank, which is then able to use the funds on the overnight European MTN trading market where they can earn between 1 per cent and 2.5 per cent profit per night. The compound interest on that sum is huge. If it is genuine, a vast profit is being made on this money somewhere.

I believe that this is now such an important issue that I have put everything that I have got on the subject on to a 104-megabyte memory thumb. I want the Government to take it all, put it to some suitable investigative bureau and find out the truth of what is going on here, because something is very seriously wrong. Either we have a huge amount of tax uncollected on profits made or we have a vast amount of money festering away in the European banking system which is not real money, in which case we need to take it back. I ask for an investigation and for noble Lords to support my plea.",0,1329736203,null,0,false,0,c3t1uav,t3_pxnw6,t1_c3t1uav,t3_pxnw6,null,1428386560,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

He avoided it, but everyone he knew who got into it is now either dead, mentally fucked to the point of no recovery or in Prison.

His cousin is now inside doing life for murder, over a crack deal that went tits up.

I'm sure this goes on, but *this* particular story seems like journalists interested in mirroring the writers of The Wire and trying their hand at gritty urban slang that came off as contrived and insincere. At points they're actually trying too hard to use slang where it probably wouldn't be used.

Right now I'm reading Pigeon English, which is a fictional tale about a Ghanaian immigrant child of 10 living on an estate who tries to find out who killed a classmate. It's loosely based on the Damilola Taylor case, and is written by Stephen Kelman, a 36 year old university educated white man who grew up in Luton. The whole thing was hailed as ""authentic"" and ""realistic"" by people who seem to draw their view of reality from pieces like this. The book was mainly hyped, not surprisingly, by the Guardian.

Maybe it's because I'm reading that book that I'm so in tune to this right now. I mentor kids and do regular talks with them. They just don't sound like the kids these journalists and novelist keep apparently talking to. Maybe I'm lucky and I grew up in the ""nice"" parts of Deptford and New Cross. Maybe my living in Lewisham I'm far removed from the lives of these kids that journalists based in the home counties who commute into London seem to run into with alarming regularity.

I've never touched the stuff, not because I'm anti-drugs or I was scared of the effect but for ethical reasons; look at the underclass in London it creates, look at the victims of trafficking, the slave labour, the murders in Mexico happening every day, the destruction of natural environments in Colombia.

Some of the people I knew that took cocaine were vegans, vegetarians, donated money to charity, took part in charity events, went to ""people and planet"" events or only bought locally produced organic food.

We get through to the cup final, as do Liverpool. Wembley is buzzing, and we all bear witness to one of the most fantastic displays of football ever seen. It starts off with a spectacular bicycle kick goal from Denis, cementing his place as an Everton cult hero. However, that smarmy little fucker Suarez sneaks in an equaliser just before half time. Not to worry though, as in the 75th minute Cahill scores with his head. Tears of joy roll down his cheeks as he punches the corner flag, and we can all see what it means to him. Wembley is bouncing, we're just about to clinch it... The thing is, Clattenburg is officiating the match as the FA have still not realised that he is directly employed by Liverpool Football Club. This oversight by the FA leads to an 86th minute penalty, unfortunately converted by Kuyt (of course). 

Now, there are 3 added minutes. With about 45 seconds to go, a small figure bombs up from the right. He takes it past three Liverpool players, and cuts into the box. Everyone is on their feet, mouths wide open. You can cut the tension in Wembley with a knife. There is a brief moment of silence as Tony Hibbert rolls the ball onto his left foot and strikes it towards goal. Time goes in slow motion as the ball curls around Pepe Reina's outstretched fingers, and into the back of the net. Wembley erupts. Screams of ""riot!"" come from every corner of Wembley, and Evertonians around the world are driven insane with joy as they witness something they never though they'd see in their lifetime. 

A white aura surrounds Tony Hibbert seconds after scoring his first career goal for Everton. He knows his job is done, he does not need to stay any longer. Angels descend from heaven, blasting Z-cars on their divine trumpets. They carry him up to heaven, where he will wait for 33 years until he will return to combine with Denis Stracqualursi (who as we all know is part god) and usher in one thousand years of peace for mankind. Unfortunately, Evertonians are first subjected to 33 years of misery, as the departure of Hibbo has guaranteed Phil Neville a first team spot until he is 68 years old.

I was attending the A4e center in woolwich in the spring/summer of last year for 13 weeks.

My experience was to be shoved into a room for thirteen weeks with thirty other people and six working computers and just told to get on with searching for jobs, with virtually no other assistance other than maybe once or twice a week stopping the pandemonium for a minute and shouting ""high street retailer wants guys to work sixteen hours a week for your benefit money"". Most popular were argos and HMV at the time.

 If you didnt get a computer, well, tough shit. You just had to sit and bullshit with other people, play around on your phones, read a book, or play cards for eight hours a day. Every once in a while, you'd be handed a fucking wordsearch to entertain you, with a prize of a box of malteasers if you were first or second. 

If you bunked off for any reason (in my case I could get more time searching for jobs at my local library each day booking 6 hours of computer time with both mine and a family members library card) your benefits would be docked for that week.

I counted myself lucky. Over on the other side of the building theres a room/group with people who have english as their second language, or come from countries with an agricultural background. Instead of receiving some help with CVs or getting set up with email addresses, their ""advisor"" just left them quite literally to sit in a room for month. 

They all spoke different languages or rather poor english so effectively it was them being left to amuse themselves. They got one wordsearch* per week* and then to add insult to injury theyd get the same wordsearch week on week. Eventually the volunteer counsellors at this place (many out of work themselves) took on the job of the absent A4e employee and helped these guys out with making CVs or setting up email addresses. 

As I left I heard that the counsellors had banded together to form a charity doing the same thing, but effectively getting paid as they could bid for contracts in a similar manner.

Anyway, the point was that although the company had been awarded a fatass contract, you could tell the money wasnt appearing and was being skimmed off elsewhere. The buildings were terrible, old and decrepit and everything was plainly done as cheaply as possible.

This kind of fraud investigation is long overdue and I personally can only hope a number of people in high positions of this company are imprisoned for fraud since they kept the money for themselves that should have been spent actively helping people find work instead of effectively imprisoning them for eight hours a day with inferior resources to find work than those they could have had outside.",0,1329743381,null,0,false,0,c3t29pv,t3_pxmya,t1_c3t29pv,t3_pxmya,null,1428386762,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

I do admit that Arsenal has a much greater recent history than us. and, so what? 

Were a club that has massive potential, and well keep getting better every year. Weve tasted champions league success, and we are hungry for more.  The Arses fans are the only ones who are hungry. You are a big club that has been getting worse and worse in the last few years. Your transfers in the last 6 years have been embarrassing, and there is no indication that will change any time soon.  

So yes, keep obsessing on your glorious past.

Well look to the future.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;To quote Morgan Freeman when asked ""How do we get rid of racism?"":
""Stop talking about it.""

Bullshit cop out and people need to stop going to it. 

First lets get the obvious out of the way, I have no idea what's going on in this story. From an outside look it seems an aggrieved mother ran straight to the press making another mother run straight to the press. It was blown up by the press and the school.

Now on to your quote, mostly trotted out annually as our American cousins embark on Black History Month. It's become quite the predictable tradition here on Reddit. Now, first lets assume Morgan Freeman isn't the president of black people. That way we can avoid the odd situation of adding more weight to his words than is totally necessary. People only repeat it because they conveniently agree with it, it's not at all that insightful or well thought out. It's basically the ""ignore him and he'll stop"" advice tired mothers give their youngest children being bulled by an older sibling. As in that case it's a convenient way of not dealing with the issue.

Looking through the history of racial clashes I'm finding it hard to identify when this advice draws it's precedent. Was it the 400 years of slavery or the near 700 years of British Colonialism that informs this opinion? As I read it most slaves simply went about their business, mostly unaware themselves of the injustice they were actually living. In other words, they didn't talk about it. It didn't go away all on it's own funnily enough.

Lets take race relations in the UK and US over the last 50 years. Again, simply sitting back taking shitty jobs and accepting ""sorry, no blacks or Asians"" with a head nod and hat tip didn't make situations any better either. Actual civil rights movements , protests, rioting and landmark equality legislation went into getting us from there to here. 

So, excuse me when I struggle to understand where this nonsensical ""lets ignore it, it'll go away"" viewpoint came from and why people love it so. It's lazy, ignorant of history and fairly insensitive to boot. Stop it.",0,1329749772,null,0,false,0,c3t2vkw,t3_pxmdj,t1_c3t2vkw,t1_c3t1q04,null,1428387048,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Think of it this way though, if we manage to pick up a speedster in the summer and keep the current front line we'll be in perfect shape - craft from Suarez, aerial power and hold-up play from Carroll and pace from A.N.Other.

Or of course, there is what I believe the even worse situation of having big pharma get in. Imagine being able to buy crack and other substances from the chemists- how much money and power these big pharmaceuticals would accumulate- all legally. And imagine what political power they would wield, with thousands of addicts now relying on them to give them their fix. What would they do to ensure the drugs keep flowing. Would they vote for who they're told to? Big pharmacy already has massive power globally. I don't think they should be given this on a platter. 

People seem to think that if drugs are legalised their local neighbourhood cannabis dealer would be popping round, and it would all be smiles and rainbows.

I don't know if you're actually searching for accommodation yet or whether just looking for potential housemates at the moment? Have you considered lodging?

Obviously supply/demand for accommodation/housemates is going to be massively effected by your area so maybe housemates/lodgings are just difficult to come by where you are? I was fortunate (as a landlord) that in my area demand for lodging accommodation far outstripped supply.

If I had it my way everyone would approach these racial accusations logically and not let crazy emotions in every which direction get in the way of things. Of course that is tricky because it can be very emotional for some people.

I wouldn't presume to know even what the percentages of cases between different ethnicities is, but I do know that cases can go too far in pretty much every direction all too easily.

I have loads of anecdotes of things that have happened to people I know that should have been handled differently by any logical thinking police, but it's not fair to assume anything is biased in any direction from that as I know way more white people. And I've heard plenty of stories from non-white friends of actually being victimised by police too so it's not like the police are some ethnic-minority protecting force. From what I've seen they are quite conservative about calling anything racism (probably makes too much extra paperwork for them, to be a cynic... :P).

It just annoys me when people seem incapable of just using some common sense on a case by case basis, take some context and intent into account and it's usually obvious if someone is actually being racist or not.

Regarding your other common in here re: ""not talking about racism"" - I agree with most of that but the situation is always relevant. Eg. it's good to ""talk about it"" as long as there's actually relevance, ie. any sort of discrimination happening, as it is absolutely important to actively fight against that.

But in this situation for example, the boys comments and everything after that could have been handled without bringing the word ""racist"" into it at all, and without any such accusations or anything.

It seems to happen automatically simply because there are different coloured children and comments regarding colour involved. If the kid was actually being harassed then sure there could have been some racial motivation, but otherwise it's a ridiculous assumption when you're talking about a question asked by a 7 year old.

Probably not the best analogy - but imagine if we started calling a 7 year old kid a bigot for asking a girl if she has a barbie doll because she's a girl. And imagine calling someone a thief or a rapist or something without having any real indication of guilt - it seems like people manage to call people racist far too easily without any risk of libel or anything - it appears to be a very socially acceptable accusaion that people often get away with claiming without reasonable grounds.

Spurs fans are the happiest they've been with the team in recent history, despite being ""only third in the Premier League and out of Europe."" We went down 4-0 at the San Siro, down to 10 men, and we still had a player come up with brilliant plays to cut it down to 4-3, meanwhile our fans just wouldn't shut up, and we went back and beat Milan on their own turf. We get a negative result against Stevenage or an underwhelming performance, as there have been many this year, and we live and let live, shit happens sometimes, but there can always be improvements.

Meanwhile, Arsenal have the most fickle bunch of jackasses for ""fans"". One negative results and some of you people start calling for Wenger's head despite the fact that, despite having your worst season in the Wenger era, you're still in 4th place.

I'd also like to interject here, learn your own fucking history, you delusional, knee-jerk, glory-hunting twat. Arsenal had their worst Premier League season ever that season, when they sacked George Graham (you know, only the most successful manager Arsenal had until Wenger), and then next season they saw an exodus of players, fought relegation most of the season, and finally finished 12th. But I doubt you knew that, since anything before 2002 is old news and irrelevant, right?

Stop acting like you're entitled to greatness. You're not, and that sort of mindset is what's infecting Arsenal at the player and fan's level. The players get discouraged when anything goes against them because when they were younger, Arsenal was the greatest team in England and since they're playing for Arsenal now, they must surely be the greatest, right? Your fans have the same mentality, that's why the Emirates has the most shit atmosphere in the Premier League and your ""fans"" turn on the players and manager on a whim. One day they destroy Blackburn 7-1 and are the greatest team since Capello's Milan, then a week later they're surely relegation fodder and the board are the worst group of people in the world and Wenger is past it and Ramsey is worse than Bin Laden and everyone needs to go because no one is good enough.

We're the happiest we've ever been with out team, and meanwhile, one place down on the table, you lot look like you could use some anti-depressants.

Usually people are making a point that it would have a positive societal impact to stop segregating rights of minorities into separate organizations; to stop holding awards ceremonies for people of a particular color; to stop segregating non-white culture and history.

No-one's saying that that will solve the problem of racism. You can only solve that through education which is very deep-seated and takes generations. But if you're segregating non-white culture and history, then you're not making a very good start with the education, are you?

DST is just one problem, the orbit of the earth isn't subject to our arbitrary time measurements so every now and then we have ""leap seconds"" to get things back in sync. If you are doing historic data you need to account for the switch from Julian to Gregorian calendars and missing days that never existed. It's a mess. 

If the coders do it right there's no need to deal with the number of hours in each day because the date library does it for them. A good one is maintained with updates of timezone changes (which happen more often than you'd think), so that when a country changes it's switch-over date it's simply deals with it for you via the libraries localisation. A user in Chile sees the date switch at 10pm while someone in Brazil sees it switch at midnight.

Why should it be called anything else? The first *ever* MOBO award went to Tim Westwood...a white DJ! Saying ""why segregate"" seems to suggest there was some hope this side of the entertainment industry was going to be recognised anyway and people in black music slapped the hand away.

Perhaps you should stop thinking about Travellers as one entity, and consider the fact that there are children who are suffering because they are being placed between two cultures, neither of which they have any choice in; one which does not share the values of the law, and one which does not respect their parents way of life.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"Last I checked, the Defence of the Realm Act wasn't necessarily about stopping us from drinking, and I would say that's really trying to read between the lines to find some evidence of a history of boozing.

If you want to stop this binge-drinking, if it's so problematic that 18+ year olds go out into town and get hammered so often, try providing and subsidising alternatives rather than the top-down ""Mummy says no"" approach that seems to be so popular. I'm 26, for the last 8 years of my life, I'd say that while drinking isn't a huge issue for me, whenever it comes to finding other things to do with friends, there's really jack all to do. The cost of cinemas, meals and everything else outstrips most people's sensible disposable income and it's only really getting worse because we live in a culture of exploitation for profits, where everything reinforces that the world we live in is founded on milking what we can for what we can get.

I would say that the youth of today are disillusioned and fed up. I see it in the people my age I talk to, I see it in those younger than me and it's certainly in those older than me. It's obviously worse now with the post-recession world, but I don't think there's many people who want or appreciate being told that they can't do what they want, precisely because it's this which I think makes drinking appealing in the first place - it's cheaper and easier in some cases than the alternatives.

Of course, these are just my musings. I can't say for certain that everyone feels this way, and I'd be interested in hearing anything anyone else has to say on alternative nights out on a budget.

However, you cannot state that abuse, bullying and discrimination is partly the fault of the travellers by saying that *it's got to come from both sides*.

This is essentially saying that ginger people need to dye their hair in order to stop anti-ginger jokes. *it's got to come from both sides*.

Ignorance and hate have to stop, and that comes down to people's attitudes; not council/state policies, and certainly not anyone's cultural heritage.

People who are being forced by rents to use housing benefit despite having a full-time job are in the position iof being screwed over. They can't leave to live somewhere cheaper without losing their job, but they can't stay in London because of the rents when their benefit gets capped. So here's a thing. Any landlords who accept housing benefit claimants get their rents capped at a figure deemed to be appropriate for the property and its actual value. The landlord can always say he or she doesn't want to do that, but then they can't accept housing benefit claimants and may only accept private tenants. 

Ergo, shades of grey.

On top of that, people are already told by the government what to do with their own property. If you have a car it has to be taxed, MoT'd, you can't speed in it or ram raid shops or run down pedestrians. Similarly, landlords have to adhere to strict rules concerning health and safety in their properties. This is merely one more regulation to add.

&gt;Well, yes, they generally go out to white artists. But that's part of the problem, no?

No, it's not. If a mostly white audience doesn't like ""urban"" music, then why would anyone expect those artists to receive awards? The black music award shows are intended for the specific audience and fans of black music to see their artists awarded for that type of music.

&gt;Saying ""It's called the Brits"" sounds like a depressingly defeatist attitude to take, by implying that the major awards are and always will be for white people.

I'll ask, what can be done? I'll put it this way. Over the last few years there has been an emergence in the UK of the white female RnB singer. While black artists have been putting out this music for years, no one in the mainstream has really taken notice of the UK artists...but, as soon as the likes of Amy Winehouse, Duffy and Adele start singing the same types of song, white audiences who one didn't like that music flocked to buy it. Now, black artists can sit there with their hands folded like god little children waiting on recognition, but that would get them nowhere...they could call out the double standard, but that would only get them accused of being race baiters and overly sensitive, there's no way to prove someone bought a record of one artist over another for any other reason than they just liked this song better than that song.

My view on the wages is that we could *maybe* afford Mourinho's salary (seems to be about €10m/year atm, including bonuses), because I think we could reasonably back ourselves to finish higher in the league and go far in the Champion's League with him.

Where I think we would struggle is affording the transfer and wage budgets that he has come to expect.  His transfer policy has been pretty much the opposite of Levy's.

Where I think we might benefit is that Financial Fair Play means that all clubs will struggle to pay exorbitant fees and salaries in the near future, and we may have the advantage seeing as our budget is so much more balanced than most English clubs.",0,1329769342,null,0,false,0,c3t675t,t3_py2mt,t1_c3t675t,t1_c3t5xyl,null,1428388617,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

As for your attack on my concept of unity, has it ever occurred to you that the feelings I hold at the moment are *gasp* reactionary? If you honestly think I hate Scotland because I hate Scotland then you're neither as smart as you think you are, nor smart enough to lecture me on my opinions. Ignoring for a second that secession on Scotland's part would do a disservice to the country since they want to be free of our restrictions but still get whatever they, or rather, Salmond wants to get whatever he can get his grubby mitts on with the Devolution Max plan. Not to mention the political disservice. I don't recall if you were the one to show disdain for the Tories or not and frankly I can't be arsed to go back and look, but Labour seems to have quite a power base in Scotland through the SLP. A power base that would disappear if Scotland were to seceed since they would no longer have any part in British elections. 

Which means the opposition government suffers a blow to its electability while not necessarily able to do anything about it. Hell, Cameron might secretly be egging Salmond on for that reason alone. Lord knows he's short-sighted enough. 

Then we come to the oil question, arguably the biggest toss-up that's gonna happen should Scotland decide to push ahead with this. Controlling so much domestic oil is a boon for Scotland and yet today's papers stated that Iran was ""banning"" the UK and France from buying any of its oil. Now while we always have Saudi Arabia amongst other countries, Oil is expensive enough as it is. Does it not do a disservice to the country to seceed during a time when the most prominently used natural resource in the area is in such high demand?

Additionally, one could question the impact on trade. Obviously it's cheaper to trade across land than across oceans, but the companies themselves will need to be seperate, you can't trade with just yourself after all. 

Lastly we must consider the diplomatic fallout. A military alliance with Scotland would be a sign of good faith and no hard feelings, assuredly, and it would be easier to support Scotland in the event of its invasion than any other ally. However, what could we expect in return? If Scotland is fine with the notion of leaving us then how can we be sure it will uphold its end of such an alliance? Should England be invaded, what guarantee would we have that Scotland would respond appropriately?

I can promise you now that the disservice Salmond is proposing to put England through is far greater than any disservice to Scotland that I can do from my desk chair. Besides which, if they do seceed, then I have to question whether or not they truly are my countrymen.

He's only 23, and as Kenny said when he was bought, he's been bought for where he'll be in 5 years time, not necessarily this or next year. I can't see him being sold either.

I do, however, think there's room for another striking option, a different type of striker, to play alongside Luis. 
I hope I'm wrong (and I know he scored goals by the bucket in Holland) but I see Suarez as a 15 goals a season guy, but someone who creates a lot more. I think we need to get a more selfish finisher who can get 25 a season, more like an Owen or Fowler. 

Who though? That's the question. 

I could see 2 of these 3 playing up front (as part of a 4-4-2) giving us options, dependant on who we're playing, plus working as cover for injuries. Maybe one of the academy players could step up?

But he was found ""guilty"" on a basis of probability, judged by one man's word, who had been given access to evidence that we were, inexplicably, denied. I'm not condoning the decision to not shake Evra's hand - I can understand why he didn't want to, but if he told Dalglish he would do it, then that's poor form from him.

But regardless of all of that, can't anyone just realise that dragging this whole thing on doesn't achieve anything? If anti-racism groups continue to criticise the club months after the incident, what good does that do or achieve? I agree it might be a bit rich of us to want the whole thing to 'go away' now, but does keeping the debate active achieve anything constructive?

It's disappointing that the media and anyone and everyone with a voice of authority has portrayed this whole saga as being ""for or against racism"", when it's really a bit more complex than that. I wonder whether these leaders who criticise us for wanting to appeal the report actually read it thoroughly? Things like this, plus the PM's ""racism summit"", honestly just look like opportunistic bandwagoning, from people who just want to get their two cents in to show that they are against racism, rather than actually grappling with the faulty FA process that got us here. This doesn't help fight racism - it just creates a bigger siege mentality around the club.

Note: I don't know whether Suarez racially abused Evra. I don't think anyone but the two of them know; for the rest of us, despite our loyalties and what we think one way or another, it's probably a 50-50 chance he did.

true,Flany,lfc99,,"I'd like to see us go to a pass and move like Swansea and Gladbach have used to shoot up their respective league tables.  Both teams were irrelevant and are now having fantastic seasons with the latter even challenging for the Bundesliga title. 

Quick, technical players who are comfortable playing 1 touch, and who are impossible to mark because you never know where they'll be.  

Joe Allen from Swansea would be great and help with quotas and such...he could cover Lucas, but not just rot on the bench when Lucas plays, as he could play alongside him as well in a 4-3-3.  I'd prefer Javi Martinez, but I don't think we could afford him.  One of those 2 to cover the midfield would be awesome. 

A striker who can play on the back line of defenders and finish some of the chances we create.  Gonzalo Higuain is my dream signing, and if Madrid move for a striker, he will be available albeit for a hefty price.  

A right winger who could play pass and move, and beat a man and get to the end line.  Hazard is the dream, but I'd love Marko Marin who is available for about 10 million Euros if the media is to be believed (which they're not I know)

A trequartista.  Someone to play that role off of a striker, and chip in with goals, because Stevie needs a long term successor, and he hasn't been that great for us when you remove the red glasses.  Kevin Prince Boateng is a dream modern footballer because he combines ability with incredible athleticism...though he won't be available surely.  Someone young who could pull the strings like a Sergio Canales if he recovers from his injury, or any of the super Germans in Kroos, Muller and Gotze. I'd also fancy Erikson from Ajax.  

Jan Vertonghen with only a year and a half left on his contract may be worth it as well.  One of the only CBs out there comparable to Agger who can also play in the midfield.  Great player and available for relatively cheap. 

My dream 11 to start next year: 

-------------Reina 

Johnson--Skrtel--Agger--Enrique 

---------Lucas-Martinez/Allen 

Suarez----Gerrard/Erikson-----Marin 

--------------Higuain

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; I know some christians who despair of this kind of gay-bashing, because the lunatic fringe of their religion is the one with the loudest voice, and those who aren't total pricks get tarred with the same brush. 

If you accept the Ipsos MORI poll from the other day:

&gt; [Homosexuals should have the same legal rights in all aspects of their lives as heterosexuals](http://richarddawkins.net/articles/644942-rdfrs-uk-ipsos-mori-poll-2-uk-christians-oppose-special-influence-for-religion-in-public-policy) (Q41, page 10)

* Agree (both strongly + tend to combined) - 61%
* Disagree (both strongly + tend to combined) - 21%
* Don't know + prefer to not say + neither agree nor disagree - 18%

So... The fraction of Christians in the country who ('openly') disapprove of gay marriage is 21%. That would be 21% of 54% (people who identify as Christian) -&gt; ~11%, so 1 in 10 of the overall population (not including people who are not religious but disapprove for other reasons). It's interesting to note that when compared to other questions about 'how' Christian they really are (i.e. Do you believe Jesus was the son of god etc.), the fraction of people who believe in the teachings of Christianity and who go to church every week is within only a few percentage points (~20% of the 54%). I wonder if that's just a coincidence!

To sum up my over-long comment: Yes, most people - and as such most Christians - don't have a problem with full equality for gays. The only people with (they think) something to lose and get upset about it end up being the most vocal - such is the way of the world.

The fact Brighton got away with it all, and he still managed to get an assist and a goal is pretty impressive if you ask me.

Edit: Just want to expand a bit here - players like Dzeko and Drogba are the same height/build as Carroll, how often do you see them winning those types aerial battles? Hardly ever. It's not Carroll's fault, it's the players around him. In all honesty I'd say only Gerrard, Adam and Enrique look like creating chances for him, we've got Henderson on the right (who I don't think I've ever seen complete a cross) and Downing on the left, who has been very poor for us this season.

All we needed to avoid this whole mess was the right people to mediate prior to the FA ruling and some coaching for Suarez so that he properly defended himself (that Evra clearly had).  This has become a stick to beat us with and because of the moral high ground is one that won't go away. I honestly can't see how this is going to be resolved for the better without the owners stepping in and taking some drastic action, which could only be one of a few things 1) legal action against the FA to challenge their handling of the matter and their findings 2) a full and frank apology which could include the sale of Suarez or 3) a new manager to draw a line under it all. If anyone can think of a 4 or 5 I'm all ears.

Do I think Suarez is guilty? Possibly. Do I think that Evra and Man Utd have used this as an opportunity to gain an unfair advantage over the club and unsettle our star player? Defintely. Do I think that the FA wanted to make an example of Suarez to score points against Blatter? Defintely. Do I think the FAs handling of the John Terry incident and subsequent attitude towards Chelsea is inconsistent with that of their approach to this and our club? Defintely.

1.) The book builds up the ending for us, providing both more content behind the Comedians break down and aiding in thematics at specific points, mirroring what is happening in the core story. It also provides a lot more foreshadowing.

2.) Dr. Manhattan is godlike but defined and known. Further, he is now perceived as a petty and angry entity who willingly destroyed countless lives over some emotional turmoil. In a story about the differences in philosophical beliefs and how people use them, the movie leaves most of humanity as fearful of God. The book leaves them as fearful of the unknown, which at least I find to be a stronger ending and is certainly more in line with Moore's intent -- that people use these philosophies to grapple with the unknown world at large.

I just want to specify that I enjoy the movie despite thinking it really missed the point.

true,lightsaberon,null,null,"&gt;Or BT, a successful profitable company which mostly provides a reasonable service (it's not the best but compared to month long waiting lines on ancient equipment that was the case pre-privatisation, it's heaven)? My phone line isn't hellishly expensive, neither is my broadband, and if I don't like it I can get it from someone else.

So, what's the probability?  A 30% chance that we'll all still be applicable for some healthcare under a privatised system?  It's all ok as long as healthcare is just expensive and not hellishly so?

BT was forced by the government to update it's services, especially its broadband infrastructure.  There are still many people in Britain who are waiting for broadband, yes in 2012.

Also, an emergency service is hardly the same as broadband.  No ones going to suffer serious illness if BT fucks with them.  There are plenty of disputes, BT cutting people off, making it difficult for people to move homes, incorrect billing, etc.  It's one thing to deal with hassle like this when you're young and healthy, another when you're seriously ill and your health depends on getting it sorted out as quick as possible.

&gt;It's very easy to pick examples of privatisation that did work or didn't work depending on your viewpoint. Some were good, some were bad.

Almost like we shouldn't jump to privatisation at all. 

&gt;If you assume that what is happening is truly ""privatising"" the NHS, that is. It seems like a very poor summary of a much larger and more complex issue. Probably because it's convenient and provides maximum hyperbole. 

Or maybe people remember the exact same bullshit story being fed to them back in the 80s?  Many didn't believe it then, why should they today?

Trust isn't something that politicians should demand as a right, it has to be earned.  The same ideologically driven process has produced bad results, perhaps Britons aren't willing to gamble their health, their children's health, grandchildren's health on the chance that this will be one of the times it goes right.

My understanding is that they play a 3-4-3 which would leave more open room in the corners for him to maneuver.

**edit** just to clarify my comments before I get downvoted to hell.

I'm not for this law, but I think something needs to be done. I doubt anyone loses sleep over the thought of squatters taking over some big house that has been left empty for a year. What people care about are the cases where people leave their property unoccupied for a short period of time to find some gang has broken in, changed the locks and moved in a family. 

Unfortunately it's hard to prove that they have broken in as the damage would be repaired by the time you get there and then the owners have to spend their time and money going through civil courts to remove them. So perhaps we need a law to criminalise squatting in properties that have only been unoccupied for a short period of time.

Salmond and the SNP are right. Scotland has no voice, no representation in the world. 

NZ is nowhere near as rich as Scotland, yet they have taken the chance to promote this small nation far better than Scotland has, they even positioned themselves economically once the UK joined the EU and NZ lost it's biggest export market overnight.

The fact that NZ has a seat at the UN and is a member of other international organisations is a great thing.

Ironically, sometime they debate here in NZ if they should not be a part of Australia in a sort of Australasian Union. But no one ever seriously wants that and it's laughed away. 

Scotland needs independence, not because the English are evil, but because English people should run England and Scottish people should run Scotland. 

Scotland needs independence because we are viewed as a cute attachment to England 
[How Scotland is seen](http://www.muzzerino.com/2011/08/englands-exports-vs-scotland-exports.html)

I love Canadians, but I don't want them to run Scotland either. There is nothing Anti-English about this whole process.

There are however, a variety of things that upset me as a Scot, that could be deemed Anti-Scottish, or mis-directed rage, perhaps you guys can decide. 

*Scot's are Subsidy Junkies.
*Scot's get free tuition fees, England doesn't.
*Scotland doesn't contribute anything to the UK
*We get shitty Scottish Prime Ministers
*Aircraft carriers are being built in Scotland with English money, that's not fair. 
*Scot's can vote on English matters but not vice versa (which is not entirely true)

Then of course we have David Camerons [real respect agenda for Scotland](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=PE4zad27dT0)

I actually don't go in to museums very much - you can find better museums in big cities like London, NYC, Paris etc. What you want to show is the stuff that you just won't find elsewhere very easily.

This the hardcore tour for pretty fit people:    
**a**) Start near Lady Margaret Hall. Walk south through University Parks, making sure to tour around the small lake in the NE corner (you get a good feel for LMHs back garden too, setting the tone). You can point out the science area without having to go too close to it.     

**b**) Exit the park near Linacre and you come out in the middle of massive sports grounds in the middle of a very expensive city. Follow the walls of Magdalen making sure you point out that it's a fucking college that used to protect itself from the riffraff roaming about outside. This is quite mind blowing to most people from outside 'old Europe' who aren't used to Universities having this type of problems.   
   
**c**) Enter Magdalen. Very cool for everyone, especially as the HUGE contrast in volume level between High Street and being inside. It's like entering a completely different world. The deer are just ridiculous and add to the otherworldliness of it all.      

**d**) Leave Magdalen and walk down to Christ Church meadow. If the people are fit, walk all the way to the rowing area for some of the best views of Oxford skyline.      

**e**) Enter Christ Church, though because of the density of tourists I typically end up running through the place quite quickly. Still, a nice place to show.    

**f**) Exit Christ Church in the back. Now you have a choice of which way to go. I typically follow Merton street and go through University College to High Street after explaining the old colleges along Merton street.     

**g**) Go up Queen's lane and sneak in to New College, showing the quad used in Harry Potter (which looks damn gorgeous in any case, worth a visit). It's the one right next to the exit from Queen's lane with the monstrous tree in the middle of it.      

**h**) Go eat at the Turf - people will be hungry (if they're older or in bad shape, they got hungry earlier and you could have hit, say, Head of the River).      

**i**) From Turf walk to Blackwells and point out how far Oxford goes to protect its image while catering to an extremely sophisticated group of customers (IE the underground area).      

**j**) Come past Sheldonian and through Divinity School to take a stroll around Radcliffe Camera, showing All Souls (pretty!) and then showing the doorway that inspired the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (its a Brasenose door, in the small gap between St Mary's and Brasenose)       

**k**) Follow High Street until you reach the Covered Market and dive in. Exit it on the other side and go to the Oxford Union. Good for a pint or two if you're so inclined.      

**l**) Head to the Randolph and point out Ashmolean (if you're super eager, go in) and then head to Worcester. This is a question of preference, but I find outsiders find the Worcester grounds absolutely amazing... walking around the lake, checking out the cricket grounds etc.     

**m**) Typically we retire at this point, and hit Port Meadow + the Trout for dinner, but I've done this true hardcore mode too and hit the Oxford Retreat for a pint or two at this point.    

**n**) (Optional) Exit the Oxford Retreat and walk up to Port Meadow along the river.    


This tour really hits a lot of the hot spots in a single day, and definitely grinds in to most people how special Oxford is compared to so many other places.

The next day I'd hit Pitt Rivers perhaps, have lunch at the Perch (if the weather is good) and have dinner at Jamie's and enjoying something at the theatre right outside.

I suppose any justification behind my opinion is simply the fact of my family history. With both my grandfather and great grandfather being CoE vicars, being of middle class background, I can't deny that religion has never been in my life. After all, I'm studying it for my A levels at the moment, possibly studying it at university this year.

I'm not a Christian, never been baptised, worship, but wouldn't say I'm atheist, but agnostic.

I suppose me reiterating my idea that the definition of marriage should stay as it is, with civil partnership giving them the same rights, is me refusing to budge.

I have no hatred towards same sex couples, I suppose that's due to the fact I was born in the 90s, so the era I've grown up in has been more accepting of them compared to my elders.

I suppose from what I've said, it sounds off that I agree that they should be treated the same, considering I've said that I believe a marriage is male and female, not same sex which civil partnerships are, and as someone said they're essentially the same thing so why have different names.

I suppose this all relates to my thinking of religion, which I suppose is my only justification behind this matter. I can't think of anything else to add, but I need to head off now otherwise I'll be late for my lesson.

If you reply, I'll check it when I return around half one.

P.S. I've enjoyed seeing my comment karma fluctuate up and down xD
P.S. Can't think where to add this, but I'll add it here. Perhaps a marriage in the aspect of the law, can be any couple, whereas the religion sense (i.e. Christian) should only stay to male-female relationships. I've been meaning to say that but haven't thought of where, suppose I sort of said it in a previous reply about not batting an eyelid should this happen.

I don't think Christianity should have to move away from its belief for the past couple thousand years, as it's effectively saying that they're wrong I guess.

&gt;Do you have any reliable source for this claim ? Or are you just basing this on the majority's opinion ?

You're suggesting it's not the case? The fact that you think it's a 'claim' speaks volumes. Do you have any reasoning as to why travellers/ gypsies are banned from pubs and the like, for example? It's made apparent in the previous series, and is common knowledge, so it's up to you to prove that this is somehow not the case.

&gt;Do you think that those people behavior is based on a thorough and deep analysis of the behavioral trait of this population ? Or is it more likely that they just follow majority's opinion ? 

No, it's due to their exprience that you think is a 'claim' - in short, because their bars get smashed up, or they don't get paid. Or both.

&gt;So you provided one alleged example, and you think that its enough to say that its ""not uncommon"" ? 

Yes. I'm not here to do your research for you or give you a dozen other examples simply because you have no apparent experience.

Lukaku had played 2 games for Anderlecht before joining Chelsea, which meant that he could only be loaned back to Anderlecht - if he were to be loaned back at all.

The real reason, he hasn't been loaned out, I'm guessing is because of the UEFA homegrown rule - it states that a player has to have played/trained at least 3 whole seasons at a club BEFORE he turns 21 to be considered Home-Grown at club. A squad needs to have 4 such players, minimum. The rule was enforced to ensure that local talent was adequately tracked, developed &amp; groomed. This is also why Bamford, Chalobah, Boga, Piazon won't be going out on loan. This is also why AVB was reluctant to let Josh go out on loan - he filled one of our HG (club) slots. 

At eighteen years of age, Lukaku is on the threshold for qualifying as a HG (club) - always a plus, considering JT (and now Bertrand) is the only first-team who qualifies as HG (club).

There was quite a lot of that kind of thing for a while with the various art groups that were based at the sadly defunct Priestley Centre. (Mostly moved up to GH Road if anyone is wondering where that lot went). Still no movement yet, but I think they're supposed to be picking up work on the site this year. I'll believe it when I see it. 

As for the new park I'm a big fan. I was against it initially, and I'm still unsure on whether I think it was worth all the airport money that was ploughed into it, but I think the final result is something pretty special. I work at the university and walk past it at least twice a day and several times already I've stopped and lingered just to be in the space for a while. 

What the article doesn't really make clear is what a multi purpose space it is. The fountains are great, but honestly it's a bit of shot in the dark wandering past at this time of year as to whether there'll be in any water in it or not. Presumably this is because they don't want ice bursting the pipes, or a big ice rink there. 

What it does make clear though is how easily it can be drained and turned into a very large extension to the already large public square. There are all kinds of opportunities for events there from markets to even concerts if they fancied that kind of event management responsibility. I suspect they do, because I don't see how they're going to make a penny from it directly without that and making money from it is a stated intention.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;So you are saying that majority's opinion is based on anecdotal evidence.

Nope - the police and courts could give you examples too.

&gt;If so do you think that anecdotal evidence is a reliable way to analysis and understand a phenomena ? 

See above. And Gypsies are not a 'phenomena'.

&gt;I dont understand your question and I dont see how relevant it is to the initial questioning which was ""what make you think that majority's opinion cary any value ?""

Opinion, no. Experience, yes. Opinion based on that experience, yes. As well as official police/ court/ NHS records.

&gt;I am not suggesting anything

Yes, you are.

&gt;I am asking you if you have a source to provide or if you are basing this on ""majority's opinion"". 

There are plenty of sources, people and such as listed previously, and official sources too. The series in question gives good examples of some of them - those pubs/ clubs/ events don't refuse Gyspsies just because it'll somehow make good TV.

&gt;Well by usual definition of the word, one instance of an event is not enough to define this event as ""not uncommon"".

Which is why I said there are lots. This is what I meant by 'yes, you are' - you've had the opportunity to google and haven't - at this point, it's up to you to start illustrating how my 'claims' are not true.

&gt;So you are unable to bring anything consistent to back your claims ?

See above. You haven't brought anything *full stop*.

&gt; And again I dont understand why you are making the assumption that I have no experience on those matters.

If someone asked what the difference was betwen OSX and Windows 7, would you surmise that they had no knowledge of OS's? Now apply that to your questions, and lack of infomation or knowledge to the cotrary of what I've been saying.

&gt;Sorry but I dont understand what you mean 

So....I make a comment about a thousand armchair experts not having the key information you can get from a single person with experience (of which there are a huge number), list how there are several examples on this page, including yours, give one example of someone who had an open mind that was change by experience (which again, is common), and you don't understand? Righto.

&gt;and it don't seems to answer my question about the source that would support the idea that ""majority's opinion"" tend to be more valuable than ""expert's"" opinions, care to elaborate ?

This page is an example. Lots of well-meaning but ignorant people defending those that they've never had to personally deal with. To anyone that has, the former means you don't have to confirm the latter.

&gt;So using carefully chosen word to accurately describe the state of our discussion tend to make you assume that i disagree with you ?

When you proceed from a point of 'examples?' and one is given, then proceed from 'well that's just one' as if it wasn't being presented as something that's common (as was stated), what do you expect? You haven't given any personal or experience examples to the contary, and using words like 'claims' and 'alleged' betray you.

My full manifesto is [here](http://vote4enzo.tumblr.com/Manifesto) but I´ll give you the **TL;DR** (which is pretty long, so bear with me!):

**Software**:
All computers will have Open Source software available,and if there is an open source alternative, lecturers will have to talk about it and recommend the alternatives. Informed decision making! Plus you save money.

**Feedback**:

When your work is graded and ready to be picked up, you will be notified by e-mail or sms. (because going to pick up work, and it not being there yet sucks). You will be able to pick up work as soon as it is ready, without having to wait to certain times and dates. Exam feedback will also be available.

**Better units, more transparency**:

You know those feedback forms we fill in? **they will become public domain**, and everyone will have access to them for each subject. That way teachers will have to make a bigger effort, and units wil be better. Because they will be public, before choosing an optional unit, you cjust check the feedback and decide! It will be together with the unit descriptions.

Lecturers will have to provide examples of marked work! no exceptions.

Online student council and online petitions. because we are all interested in what happens at the union, but not everyone has time to be around for every little thing!

So you say that individual experience are not anecdotal evidence ? I dont understand why you are talking about police and courts, are you inferring that the majority of people went through police and court reports to form their opinions ?

&gt;See above. And Gypsies are not a 'phenomena'.

Gypsies criminality is an (alleged) phenomena.

&gt;Opinion, no. Experience, yes. Opinion based on that experience, yes. As well as official police/ court/ NHS records.

Why do you now start referring to official police/court/nhs report ? Did you access those ? Did you make some analysis of those ? 

&gt; Yes, you are.

No i am not, was any part of my wording unclear to you ? I don't understand why you are confused...

&gt; Which is why I said there are lots. This is what I meant by 'yes, you are' - you've had the opportunity to google and haven't - at this point, it's up to you to start illustrating how my 'claims' are not true.

I did not claim anything, I am just questioning your claim. You are making those claims, it seems natural to ask you how you came to it ? The burden of proof is on the person making the claims, that's how a discussion work.

&gt; See above. You haven't brought anything full stop.

I haven't claimed anything (I did not even contradict your claims). You have claimed a lot of thing and it seems to me that despite multiple request you have yet to be able to provide anything to back those.

So you are saying that people who disagree with you are less educated than you (you said ignorant) ? And you are thinking that a personal experience as an individual (which would usually be labeled as an anecdotal evidence) carry more weight than a logical reasoning ?

&gt; When you proceed from a point of 'examples?' and one is given, then proceed from 'well that's just one' 

So you think that one undocumented example is a strong and reliable statistical fact and should be relied on to forge an opinion ?

&gt; You haven't given any personal or experience examples to the contary, and using words like 'claims' and 'alleged' betray you.

If i were to provide an example of someone having had bad opinion of gypsies who went to change it in a positive way, would that carry more weight than your opposite example ? Would that carry more weight than your opinion ? Would that carry more weight than the majority's opinion ?

&gt;I don't think Christianity should have to move away from its belief for the past couple thousand years, as it's effectively saying that they're wrong I guess.

Religion(s) do this all the time as ideas get unpopular... Divorce is now commonplace (50%?) but you can remarry... many ""dark ages"" thoughts (most old testament stuff, fire brimstone, Sin, etc.) have gone as science &amp; education has improved and such ideas have become a little outdated. 

My opinion on the subject in question though, marriage, is that it is an institution owned (if you like) by society as a whole, and not the property of any one church. So basically it's society who get to say who can belong in the club, not the church. Marriage in one form or another has been around before Christianity (ancient Greece?), and I view it as Society acknowledging a couple (of any gender) not God or a Church.

1,Tesco et al are benefiting from free labor, if they have the work for a work placement they could be employing someone to do it.

They are never going to run out of 'candidates' for free work if people have to take part.

Not only do Tesco benefit from free labour the tax payer (us) is paying for Tesco's free labour (because we pay for the benefits through tax)

2, Working in a supermarket/other type of job will only teach so much, soft skills such a time keeping etc many people already have these basic skills

Other skills, the type that are usually on job specs e.g 2 years experience of ................. needed will more likely than not not be gained stacking shelves.

Mandatory work placement should be more targeted so that they benefit  the claimant.

Plenty of charities could benefit form more volunteers, the work is potentially more varied and beneficial than stacking shelves etc

3, A job isn't guaranteed at the end of the schemes at the moment


A decent weel thought out work placement shcmee would 

1, Actually allow people on the shceme to learn skills thus becomign more employable.

2, Not be a source of free about thus being a disincentive for large firms to create jobs.

I actually dont think there is anything too wrong in expecting people to work for there benefits, there is apparently people who have no desire to work and are happy to solely exist on benefits.

Reading some other comments around here (I'm somewhat late to the party) I think I know where the 'problem' lies: I think you're arguing that marriage is (or has been for centuries), in this country, an entirely religious affair or was religiously motivated. As such ""marriage"" (being the term that religious people have used for centuries) does not or should not be applied to anything that the religious (Christians) do not like or want it to be or accept.

&gt; [Perhaps a marriage in the aspect of the law, can be any couple, whereas the religion sense (i.e. Christian) should only stay to male-female relationships.](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/py0xg/christian_coalition_petitions_to_stop_gay/c3tdxje)

You (and the people who set up this campaign) are saying that (correct me if I'm wrong): ""Marriage is a religious institution. It has been for centuries/it is divinely given, holy matrimony and the state does not have the right to change that."" Correct? I think I am, but feel free to tweak it if I'm wrong and tell me.     
It was tricky, but I worked out where you were coming from *then* found that last quote, including this: ""I don't think Christianity should have to move away from its belief for the past couple thousand years, as it's effectively saying that they're wrong I guess.""

I realise many people have said this already, but you'll forgive me if I perhaps reiterate some of their points as I go along.

Well... I think the main reason you've not been welcomed here is because you, along with the people who are setting up this campaign, are missing the point slightly (not trying to sound rude, honest) and aren't really addressing all the issues. (Mind you, some redditors like to click the down button because they don't like what they read. These people are effectively putting their fingers in their own ears, as well as everyone else's, and going ""lalala!"" They are also known as morons. Anyway.)

I'm not sure if you know much about the history of marriage in England/Wales - personally I know only a tiny amount which I looked up specifically due to this issue, a while ago - but in terms of ""It's a Christian thing"" it's quite clear that actually no, it's not, or it wasn't always and it's somewhat spurious/irrelevant to make the claim. At some point in the distant past, it came to be pass (heh) that a marriage *had* to be carried out by an Anglican clergyman (~1540?) Before that you'll agree that there must have been a time when it was a local affair to some degree and of course c.7-9th Century and before there would have been Pagan ceremonies or similar. But the [Marriage Act in 1753](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act_1753) laid out that there must be a specific formal ceremony, as previously (~1540? onward?) the only stipulation had been ""has to be done by an Anglican clergyman"".

Blah blah blah, this that and the other then we come to the [Marriage Act in 1836](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act_1836) which frees marriage from being an entirely Anglican affair (though previously Jews &amp; Quakers were exempt from *having* to marry in a CofE church). Now people could get married in other places of worship (i.e. Muslim Temple) *and* state buildings (registry offices), so long as there was a licence - parliament recognised even then that many people were not religious and so a Christian ceremony was irrelevant to them. This was particularly useful for Catholics as it meant that their own ceremony was recognised and they no longer had to have *another* service in a CofE church. Quite right, fair and proper I think you'll agree!

This is the Act I looked into recently as I wanted to know what 'the church' said at the time. As you can imagine, they weren't happy. In fact just before the Act was passed the then Bishop of Exeter succeeded (it was removed a couple of days later) in submitting an amendment which would have rendered the Act pointless - He got references to ""The Almighty"" inserted. The above Wiki link contains a quote from him, which should give you an indication as to why the Church resisted the Act, as effectively: ""It wouldn't be entirely Christian any more.""

Summary of the above: Marriage was only a 'purely Christian' institution -in law only (we don't know peoples' own feelings) - (and not even entirely so then!) for the hundred years or so from the mid 18th to mid 19th centuries. Since then it has been religious for those who want it to be religious and irreligious/secular for those who want it to be irreligious/secular - we'll leave aside the issue of divorce for the moment! If marriage was an entirely religious affair then there would never have been the secular option: Who would want it or why would it be needed?

But all through this the religious people/Christians could say: ""At least it was still a man and a woman, which is what the book says it should be"". Right? Nope. Leaving the UK for a time, over in the US there was massive religious resistance to mixed race marriages. How so? Because the book says so. There are biblical passages that make it clear you 'shouldn't marry outside your tribe'. Disgusting that the were used in the racist way they were, but very telling. My point here is that Christians do not, or did not, agree on what marriage *actually* was: It has not always been ""between one man and one woman"", at least not as we'd now recognise it (black men/women were not considered to actually be men/women the same as white men/women were).

Back to the UK and gay marriage: We are now at the stage where Christians, taken as a whole, do not entirely agree among themselves anyway! The majority of Christians are 'OK' with gay marriage ([see the Dawkins Ipsos MORI poll](http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=dawkins%20ipsos%20mori&amp;source=web&amp;cd=7&amp;ved=0CFAQFjAG&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fricharddawkins.net%2Farticles%2F644942-rdfrs-uk-ipsos-mori-poll-2-uk-christians-oppose-special-influence-for-religion-in-public-policy&amp;ei=kKZDT7eCDJSP8gOoi8n-Bw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFe3QZFJe1aEIAuDbSF5tD6Rf6jfQ)) and there are many groups who even want to perform gay marriage in their churches ([100 London Clergy call for religious gay marriage](http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/clergy-rebellion-over-gay-church-weddings)). This would be because overall people are fundamentally decent! It is a very vocal *minority* who want to keep marriage both straight and, if they can't manage that then, not in church if gay marriage is legalised.

Something that I see mentioned *very* rarely is that there *are* Christians in this country who are gay and who want to get married in their church (and no doubt with a congregation that supports them). So effectively we have one group of Christians who are denying another group of Christians, not that that is anything new. Who is to say that either side is 'right', particularly when we recall other instances when minority groups were denied equality?

With recent polls and examination of various attitudes in the UK in the last few years, we can conclude that coming up on 50% of people are not religious and, of those that are, most are not very religious at all - at least not in the sense that the vocal religious people are. It's only a minority that assume they are in the right because their book says so. Most people - no matter what religion/non-religion - are much more reasonable than the religious right think. The Lords, the Bishops, the spokespeople - they speak for *very few* people.

To sum up and again without the intention to be rude: I really think you've not thought about this enough at the moment. Your reasoning seems to be somewhat sheltered, in so far as you've listened to the religious groups who claim ""marriage"" and similar for themselves and are acting as though people are trying to take it away from them. It's not theirs and never was, not exclusively. Even among those they count as their own, there is a huge divide with, I think, more people opposing them than agreeing. It just so happens that many with a degree of power (the Lords Spiritual) generally oppose the move.

When it comes to 'forcing' religious institutions to hold gay marriages, well... that's a slightly different issue. But again I will bring up mixed marriages: Imagine a church using the bible to justify their opposition to a marriage between a white man and a black woman. It's entirely the same thing, for who is to say which bit of the book is more important than another?

My own solution to that problem is: Legalise gay marriage for anyone and everyone who wants to hold it. For those that do not want to carry out a particular type of marriage (i.e. homosexual marriage), revoke their marriage licence entirely. That way, they won't have to get into trouble. They won't like it, but I don't see why we should cater to the intolerant any more. If we, as a society, agree that are people are equal, then there's no justification behind denying two people the same right that we grant two other people. The argument that ""marriage"" is the same as ""civil partnership"" is indefensible, as if they were then we would could it the same name without any problem and there would be no argument in the first place.

ps and entirely aside:

I have to wonder why so much air-time is given to groups who either don't pay attention to national feeling, or are too focused in their ideas to accept reality.

&gt; Lynne Featherstone, the Equalities Minister, told The Independent: ""This Government is promoting a fair society where people respect each other... We are not...requiring religious groups to go against their traditions.""

This policy is a step in the right direction, but those two statements are inconsistent and I wonder how long it will be before those groups die out or transform into groups that are 'OK' with gay marriage. As an analogy: Consider a church that takes the biblical passages that talk of ""not marrying outside your tribe"" and apply it to the notion that inter-race marriages are wrong. That's traditional in some quarters, after all, when you consider the history of black people being mistreated (particularly in the US). Since when did 'tradition' mean it was acceptable to discriminate?

My solution - which I welcome criticism of as I want to know why it could be wrong - is to legalise gay marriage and if any licensed venue doesn't want to conduct a ceremony for gays, then remove their licence to perform any marriage. That way we neither allow a group to be discriminatory, nor do we force them to go against their 'traditional' beliefs.

1) People are lazy and Brighton is a fucking mess when it comes to cycling. There are barely any cycle lanes, cars treat them as places to park (or just don't give a shit about them), pedestrians walk down them all the time.

2) Car drivers are fucking crazy and drive like idiots to try and beat each and every traffic light, of which there are a *lot*. This scares the shit out of cyclists, who often cut corners trying to get to where they are going by going on pedestrian paths.

3) Brighton's one way systems are confusing as fuck and retarded is an understatement. I try my hardest to stick to traffic rules, but there is a turning in the North Laine (opposite the Office pub) where I am fucked if I am going to cycle around for an extra 5 minutes fighting with cars to try and get down the The Skiff - that road is practically dead (no-one knows how to get up it I suspect) as you have to go down and back up the Steine. Not to mention that Brighton is so hilly that cars barely struggle to get up some hills, so you can imagine what its like for a cyclist - you build up some momentum, then its stop start stop start. Especially as cars don't seem to actually keep some sort of horizontal consistency, some cars are so wide they take up the entire road, some cars are narrow but they keep far to the left and don't give space for cyclists.

And don't even talk to me about delivery vans etc. They have a valid (and respected) job to do, but they park in the most inopportune places, and the traffic all has to fight to get around it-that street leading down under the station is particularly bad, all sorts of vans just ""stop"" in the middle of the street.",0,1329836151,null,0,false,0,c3tfeih,t3_pz9zr,t1_c3tfeih,t3_pz9zr,null,1428393084,10,false,brighton,t5_2qprp,10

1) entirely optional

It's down to the age old: I cant get employed because I have no experience, I cant get experience because I have no job. 

Tesco has also just announced today that it will offer those 1,500 they took from the scheme the opportunity to either:

-continue with the scheme unpaid and continue taking their benefits

or

-take a 4 week paid work experience placement with the guarantee of a job at the end if things go well (I presume this means forfeiting your benefits).

I think this is highly admirable of tesco, and it will hopefully provide some evidence as to whether those on the scheme would rather sit on benefits at home or go out and take the job. Then perhaps either middle class guardian readers or daily mail retards will shut up about their percieved stereotypes of benefit claimants, hopefully both.

Personally I don't see the problem with unpaid work experience, provided it is only for the very short term, as this is.

Sadly, short of provided a state subsidised non-job for every single unemployed person you will never please these fools.

I suppose the first main point about what marriage is in reply to the first quote is near enough what I'm saying, just that I don't want to associate myself with what that group are saying. I've never seen myself one of those people who are completely against the whole concept of a 'gay marriage', however I just think it's best left where it is [Edit: Probably said this too many times, sounding like I'm stubborn in my ways]. I find it interesting that Christopher Biggins, who was on Loose Women yesterday actually said himself that he's against gay marriage.

I suppose I""ve come to agree with what you're saying, the last point though before the p.s., are you talking about Anglican clergymen, or others in a registry office?

Were it to pass (same sex marriage), I'm sure I'd still feel that if a vicar refuses to marry a same sex couple in his church, then that should be allowed and not bothered to be looked at. Whilst it may disappoint I suppose I just feel that to be correct, being held at a religious place of worship. Whereas, were it to be done in a registry office, should they refuse to (which I doubt they would) then that would be different, surely? That is a more secular way.

Also, in regards to the Atheism/Agnostic bit, I honestly don't know if my answer is yes or no.

true,OhWhyBother,null,null,"Erm, kinda. Here's how it works

* If you train with the club from **15 to 18 years**, you can go out on loan for the rest of your career and still be considered ""**home-grown at club**"".
* If you train with the club for **36 months** (three seasons) between **15 to 21** (e.g. 15 to 16, half season between 17-18, half-season between 18-19 and 20-21 - a total of 36 months) while spending the rest of your time on loan at other clubs (either English or European) you still qualify as ""**home-grown at club**""
* If you train with the club for, say, **two years** between **15 to 21** but spend at least **one year** with another *English* club - bringing the total time spent with *English* clubs to a total of three seasons (i.e 36 months) in the same duration, you qualify as ""**home-grown in nation**"".

Logic dictates that ""**home-grown at club**"" players are a subset of ""**home-grown in nation**"" players. The FA &amp; UEFA rules differ, however, with the **number** of ""homegrown"" players. Read the next part VERY carefully.

* The FA rules state that squad must have at least EIGHT ""homegrown in nation"" players - it could be 6 HG^nation + 2 HG^club or 8 HG^nation or 8 HG^club
* The UEFA rules are stricter - they state that the squad must have NO LESS than FOUR of each - HG^club AND HG^nation.

Any deficit in the mandatory number becomes a deficit in the total playing squad. In other words, a team is allowed a **maximum of 17 non-homegrown players** under both FA &amp; UEFA regulations.

Both the FA &amp; UEFA rules allow an unlimited number of Under-21 players. However, each differs on the definition of an Under-21 player.

* The FA rules state that ALL players under the age of 21 - irrespective of nationality and time spent at other clubs - automatically qualify as U21 players for the team.
* The UEFA states that players who are under the age of 21 need to have spent at least two seasons training at the club before they can be included in ""List B"". 

Thus, Lukaku, Piazon, &amp; Bamford do not qualify as Under-21 players under the UEFA rules but they are considered Under-21 players under the FA rules.

Also, nowhere in the rules does it say that you cannot include a player who's less than 21 years old in the squad of 25 instead of the Under-21 list. Thus, Josh would have qualified as an Under-21 and as a HG^club for both FA &amp; UEFA, but for pragmatic reasons he gets slotted in as an Under-21.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think we will bring Kakuta back as a direct Malouda replacement. He's homegrown as you said though so that means he'll only be taking up empty space (right?) I think De Bruyne has a 50/50 chance of coming back to the squad depending on what deals we can strike bringing players in. If he goes on loan he's already stated he has been in contact with Twente which could work out because they are pushing for a CL spot this season. 

The president of Santos stated that he tried to sign Willian in January but couldn't because Willian had a preagreement to join Chelsea in the summer. If this is to be believed that means we are effectively bringing in at least two wingers who can also play CAM if something happened to Mata.

It seems like Chelsea are also keen on Lucas Moura (two bids made supposedly) and I think he would be a great addition. If he comes in De Bruyne will likely go on loan. That would be 3 wingers/AM coming in. 1 homegrown. 

Sturridge can then move to the middle so we won't need to worry about splurging on another striker. 

Josh will come back, he's homegrown, but we still need a proper replacement for Lampard. If it were me I see two options...1: See what bright creative midfielders there are for a reasonable price in the 22-24 age range. 2: Breed De Bruyne as Lampard's replacement. He has an unbelievable long range shot with both feet, he's a clinical finisher from outside the box, is long range passing is strong, and his overall passing game is very good. He's not the fastest winger but makes his living through intelligence, vision, and consistent quality. Sounds just like a young Lampard. But he just might be too inexperienced to fill that void for us next season, so option 1 is probably better.

Then the next two other signing will have to be a CB and RB as you say.  I don't know who is available but I assume they would both be internationals if we are going to find the direct replacement quality we need. Although I think Bruma could actually fair pretty decently at RB for Chelsea. 

So all in all that is

3-4 wingers/AM (2 returning from loan)
2 CM's (1 returning from loan)
1 CB
1 RB

At least 2 of those would be homegrown, possibly 3. 2 of those being U21 (McEachran and Bruma). Kakuta's birthday is in June so I don't know if he will still be U21

Anyone, anywhere. The same way the state wouldn't tolerate a racist registrar. [Ever heard of Lillian Ladele](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8557966.stm)?

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","What we spend the borrowed money on matters; it's important to spend on the right things. This is, of course, not simple.

Broadly speaking, remembering that the devil is in the details, spending borrowed money on projects such that future tax take is increased is a good idea, as long as the increase in future tax take is higher than the cost of borrowing that money. If the borrowing costs more than the resulting increase in tax take, it's a bad idea.

The (very large) grey area is risky projects, where there's no guarantee that they will increase tax take beyond the cost of borrowing.

Note that this applies to individual borrowing as well - if you're currently paid £10,000/year, and could move to a job paying £40,000/year if only you could afford £5,000 in moving expenses (say moving from Bishop Auckland to Birmingham), borrowing that £5,000 makes sense in the long run. On the other hand, borrowing that same £5,000 to pay for a blowout doesn't make sense - you will not make enough extra money by having a blowout to repay the debt.

Analysing government borrowing is made difficult by the fact that (like any other long-lasting institution), they *can* roll over their borrowing indefinitely, with the cost of borrowing changing each time they roll it over (partly based on what they've done with previous borrowed money - the bond markets tend to be happier lending to governments that have spent the money wisely and are seeing returns on investment than ones that have wasted it).

So yes, as long as you're spending the borrowed money on things that increase GDP, you can just borrow more - if you can ensure that GDP doubles given the things you've spent the borrowed money on, you are fine if the cost of maintaining that borrowing also doubles.",0,1329842713,null,0,true,0,c3tgikb,t3_pz6q6,t1_c3tgikb,t1_c3te9mc,null,1428393614,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Since I'm an old fart I can remember the [net book agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Book_Agreement) which created minimum prices for books in a bid to stop binge reading.

Err, not quite. Back in the day, the minimum prices were spun as being to the advantage of the reader. Without minimum prices, the small local bookshop would be out of business. The reader could either catch the bus to the big, central cheap bookseller (perhaps a supermarket also selling food) or do without. See how important minimum prices were! Without them, young people would be deprived of books and not catch the reading habit.

The economic analysis is not identical. Alcohol is less fungible that books. Nevertheless, it is a challenge to trace the fine details of the economics to see why this matters. It is a challenge I'm ducking.

3) ""Cycle path"" up as you turn from from london road, past preston park. Goes from nothing, into a weird ""pedestrian cycle path"" (because the road gets really narrow) and its confusing when I am cycling, am I supposed to stop in case some car just decides to turn left across the road I am cycling? It isn't a pedestrian path, and it isn't a proper cycle path. Plus halfway through, theres' a huge tree right in the middle of the path.

Some other weird ones... like the ""cycle path down under the bridge"". What is that there for? Pedestrians just walk up it, there is not point it being there, and why is it down the right instead of the left? Anyone would think we could cycle *up* a vertical hill like that.

I definitely understand why it wasn't tolerated and fully agree with it, however if it's a religious leader giving a marriage service in a religious building, under religious grounds, I'm sure that's definitely different than being a religious man, but doing a secular job which doesn't have religion intervened into it.

In regards to the last bit where you mention fairies, I must say that the idea of an all powerful being creating the universe, possibly interacting is slightly different than the belief of fairies.

The first point was probably in response to what I've heard from Christopher Biggins, who said himself that even as a gay man in a civil partnership, he is against gay marriage. (I can't think what else to add to that at the moment, but should I shall reply accordingly)

The point about your racism analogy, I must say I can't fully explain how it is different to gays. I'm sure it won't surprise you that I agree with your analogy under the idea that a white man marrying a coloured woman should be allowed, but I'm since lost for words on how it's different for gay couples, since I'm s ure it was you who said that the Bible claims about marrying from within your tribe.

The debate concerns what is and isn't risk free, and will take away offers that newbies would trip up on. The argument would be if they are a too complicated, they are not risk free as you can mess it up if you don't know what you're doing.

&gt;if it's been a lot and if it's worth your time?

Yes, easily over 4 grand in my career, a new starter who hasn't done all the sign up bonuses could clear 500 in a month with no problem. The time it takes depends, you can squeeze the most out of the offers, taking hours to find the best matches between the bookie and exchange (going for 95% of the free bet), or just go for an easy one and do it in 3 mins (50-80%).

&gt;This thread makes absolutely no sense to somebody that wasn't previously a member of the MSE forums

Sorry about that, was sort of hoping to find some MSE'ers on here and get together to start a new forum.

&gt;It all looks like a scam if I'm honest

Not at all. You can get scammed by putting money into a dodgy bookmaker, but that would either be your own fault for not doing the research on the bookie (using sportsbook review and other review sites), or not reading the terms properly.

&gt;The only time I've done online gambling to get money (without gambling for fun) was the TeamLiquid SC2 TSL3 which was sponsored and you got $50 if you signed up. I got the $50 bonus, played enough games to cash out and then did so

Sounds like a casino or poker offer, I avoid both these days, as there is no value in them anymore. There was once a time when you could clear 5 grand in a month with BJ offers, not any more. I am only talking about sports betting.

&gt;Still wasn't worth my time, took something like 20 hours of playing to get enough ""thingy points"" that were required to cash out

You can get bots to play perfect strategy for you on BJ and video poker (casibot), that area is pretty much dead now. It sounds a lot like you had a bad experience with a poker offer, no value in those unless you already play a profitable game.

&gt;can you explain a little more how you've made money

OK, this is a very simple example, and just gives you an idea of the process you use to make risk free cash from Sportsbook offers.

(I've not checked t+c's, and this is all from memory with made up odds to use as an example).

BET365 have an offer at the moment, deposit 200, get a 200 bonus. So you have a balance of 400, 200 bonus funds.

You deposit some funds into Betfair (an exchange, not a bookmaker, meaning you can lay the bet. Laying is the opposite of backing (so when you back Chelsea at Ladbrokes, Ladbrokes have layed your back bet)).

You read the terms in case of min odds, probably 2 (evens). The vast majority of people who have problems with this (matched betting) don't read the terms and jump right in, this will lose you money.

You back Chelsea to win at odds of 2.5, stake of 400 (remember 200 is yours, 200 is bonus funds that won't be released until you bet it a certain number of times, in this case 3, more on that in a sec).

You then lay chelsea to win on Betfair (an exchange) at odds of 2.6 (because normally the exchange will have higher odds than the bookies) against a stake of 311.89, risking about 500 to lay it.

Whatever the outcome of the match, you will have a net balance (adding up the Betfair and BET365 profits and losses) of 300.97. So you just took BET365 for a risk free £100.

It gets more complicated when you consider when the bookie pays your bonus, whether the bonus stake is returned to you, how many times you need to roll it over before withdrawing etc. 


It does make money, it is not a scam, the only downsides are that it can tie up a large amount of cash in your float (it doesn't have too, but it's best to bet at higher odds to squeeze the most profit out of the offer), and it can be addicting (I would rather trawl through a list of 100 bookies to find £20 offer I haven't done than spend the same time on mturk for $5).


So I guess the point of this post was to see if any like minded redditors wanted to team up.

I'm more than happy to assist any newbies, but the GIOL forum on MSE would do a much better job.

&gt; Christopher Biggins, who said himself that even as a gay man in a civil partnership, he is against gay marriage

I forgot to address this: Although it may sound dismissive, I don't care that there's a gay man who doesn't mind or is against the idea of gay marriage. He's entitled to his opinion and of course it's worth taking on board what he says, but I've thought about it enough and I don't think he's 'right'. There are many gay people who don't like the idea, for various reasons. But in any case he'd be offset by the one gay person who *does* want gay marriage. In an ideal world, civil partnerships shouldn't have existed in the first place. Of course, Biggins is welcome to not have a gay marriage if he doesn't want one.

&gt; however if it's a religious leader giving a marriage service in a religious building, under religious grounds...

I realise you come to the racist question later (but dismiss it somewhat) but I'm going to ask again, as I've not yet got any reasoning: Why is it different or why should it be 'tolerated'? As I said before: that vicar might well have Christians in his congregation that *do* want to get married. The gay couple in question, for a start. The vicar has some authority, yes, but what if *all* his congregation want to allow gay marriage? Incidentally that's very similar to the reality of the CofE hierarchy versus the general (nominally religious) populace, I think.

&gt;  Although, were that to be in the old testament, as far as I'm aware that's mainly used for Jewish beliefs, whereas the new testament is for Christianity; realistically should be irrelevant if that's the case.

No! No no no no no. A THOUSAND TIMES NO! ""Old versus New Testament"" is not a valid excuse to dismiss my racism analogy. It wasn't reasoned that way by the Christians who used the bible to be racist: if *they* didn't think so, then why do you think it can be done now!? In any case, they used both Old and New Testament verses. [There are people who still do.](http://www.saveyourheritage.com/defending_gods_word_on_interracial_marriage.htm) (Scroll down to ""Answering the Critics - New Testament) Call them misguided and ridiculous (I would), but we have to acknowledge they exist.

That line of dismissal is not allowed and is undermined by the fact that Christians - ALL Christians - pick and choose bits they like and bits they don't from the whole book. Plus some think the OT stands (*some* bits of it) and others don't. If they can't agree among themselves... Have you ever heard the phrase ""God created Adam &amp; Eve, not Adam &amp; Steve!""? What does that build on, if not the OT?

Do you know how many times Jesus explicitly mentions gay people in the NT as being 'wrong', as such (according to some people)? None. Not one single word definitively says anything negative about homosexuals themselves. He does perhaps mention them though, [see here](http://www.wouldjesusdiscriminate.org/biblical_evidence/born_gay.html). The verse that is often cited to say ""Gays are bad"" is 1 Corinthians 6:9-10. Translations vary, but [this is a good critique (imo)](http://www.otkenyer.hu/halsall/lgbh-cortim.html) - First section.

Something to consider in all of this is that Jesus was rather clear about the subject of divorce...!

&gt; but I'm since lost for words on how it's different for gay couples

Indeed, I personally think that's because there is no decent argument against it. I really do advise having a think on this, looking for answers to the questions I posed earlier:

&gt; 'Best' for whom? What would be 'lost' if we level the playing field? Alternatively, do you acknowledge what would be gained?

I have no doubt that the next generation will be bemused that so many people had a problem with the idea now. In my own lifetime I've seen what social stigma associated with interracial marriage/relationships, that existed when I was young, all but disappear and I'm only about a decade older than you.

&gt; I must say that the idea of an all powerful being creating the universe, possibly interacting is slightly different than the belief of fairies.

Well there's no 'decent' analogy I can make - the 'supreme being' question being (mostly) out on its own. However, I could just have equally invoked [Russell's Teapot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell\'\s_teapot), but the content of the analogy doesn't matter really: It was the issue of belief/non-belief that's important.

I didn't hear anything about a preagreement for Willian, just that we bid the highest. I would look for better players first though. He might have juts been a panic buy.

Lucas Moura would be an interesting buy, and the Lampard replacement you were talking about - I think he's mostly a CAM, not a winger.

Another CB? Depending on Terry's recovery, maybe. But Luiz, Cahill, Ivanovic should be good enough. Who would we go after? Bruma is out of the question for next season as he'll still be on loan. Has he been playing RB? I know he's naturally CB.

And while yes, all governments borrow it would be foolish of us to get in a situation like Greece or Italy - or Japan were borrowing is over 100% of GDP. In this day and age with the resources available I think governements should forgo debt (i.e. no net debt) and create wealth funds rather than use taxes to pay interest.

It would be interesting to see which creates more wealth for a country, a sovereign wealth fund or spending via debt.

Also, during the early labour government of '97 and all through the subsequent economic boom the governement had ample opportunity to pay down debt and store wealth for the future, it largely pissed it against the wall instead.

I don't think that gypsies are criminals, at least 50% of Romani's are fully settled (last time I checked), and most people don't even realise that they probably work, live and get a long with this diverse ethnic group. I don't prescribe to the view that people in England seem to have regarding the idea that, somehow, thievery is in Romani DNA. 

The stigma against gypsies has existed for at least 500 years in Britain alone; I don't think it will be solved over night but until we accept that *all* people are victims of their situation and not responsible for it we'll *all* be better off. This, by no means, excuses individuals or groups of criminals for their actions, but you're right; it isn't fair to judge 300,000 people in the UK on the actions of a few.

This comment will inevitably bring the response ""but they choose to be the way they are""; to that I say over 50% have chosen to settle, we can punish criminals but it is completely unreasonable to expect people to change to our way of life just because we say so.

If they don't take the work placements then they actually do just lose their JSA (not sure about housing benefits or anything like that) and most of the workers there have only been out of work for a short while (less than 6 months)

One of them even used to work at a charity shop for 15 hours a week (if he worked any more than that he'd lose his job seekers allowance for some reason) and he had to give that up to come work here for 4 weeks, which i thought was fucking stupid.

If they make fewer of these trips because they would have to pay say £4 a time each, then yes, the paid economy may appear to grow. More money is paid to care homes and nurseries, but the young parents will be spending less of their money in other directions -- that is no growth at all -- and the care home fees will come out of the taxpayer's pocket -- not an increase they wish to see.

Why were we so successful against City?  As soon as Balo scored, we battened down the hatches and played counter attack.  City had one more chance and that was it.  We closed the game up and didn't leave ourselves open to the play that constantly kills us.

Have we repeated that performance?  Absolutely not.  In fact, given AVB's squad selections and just from watching the matches, we are laying attack minded players where we shouldn't be (Meireles is a goddam waste), and fucking with our fullbacks (if Cole isn't fit, Betrand plays LB.  Who knows what could have happened if Bosingwa didn't pull up with an injury).

We are leaving ourselves exposed time and again.  We race up the field, stop 20 yards out, and look for a cross that we never get on the end of.  And our midfield is chosen in such a manner that there is not cover for the back line.  So when we inevitably lose the ball, we are getting eaten alive.  We were lucky against Newcastle in December, we were lucky this past weekend.  Valencia was the best performance of the season, but it was a one off.

I used to run a small website (few hundred k per year), &amp; now I run a slightly larger website (few million a year).  
I've seen an awful lot of fraud &amp; got very good at spotting it &amp; stopping it.  
I discovered fairly early on that if no-one has actually lost anything (i.e. I spotted the fraud before despatching the goods), then the police don't care - in there eyes, no crime has been committed.  
I then discovered that the card issuer doesn't care - because they just take the funds back from the merchant - in this case you - so they haven't lost out.  
  
There were a couple of times where I presented the police with a huge amount of evidence - IP Addresses (that could be tied down to a specific location), email addresses &amp; phone numbers that had been used multiple times, &amp; addresses. It was all tied together really neatly &amp; I could guarantee that someone involved with the fraud would be at this particular address at a particular time - the police officer I was dealing with didn't even understand the basic principles of the internet &amp; had no clue what an IP Address was. Nothing useful happened in either case.  
  
""*we have their full name and a delivery address, we also have a working home number*""  

It's worth bearing in mind that you have ***a*** full name - it may match the one on the card or it may not - but it won't be the name of the person defrauding you.
You also may have a delivery address, but it's likely to be an empty property with a shared lobby (if it's an apartment or flat) that the scumbags have access to, it will not be the scumbags actual address.  

You may also have what you think is a home number - but it's not, it may look like a landline with a normal (maybe even relevant) geographic dialling code, but it's a VOIP line - &amp; unrelated to any useful address.  
  
Wow - sorry for the wall of text - **tl;dr** : they're a bunch of scumbags that you have almost no chance of bringing to justice.  
  
**Ninja Edit** : your best bet is to implement Payer Authentication (3DSECURE) - this removes the liability from you &amp; puts it onto the card company - &amp; may also help you negotiate your (probably) exhorbitant rates down a bit.",0,1329864291,null,0,false,0,c3tkvi4,t3_pzgn4,t1_c3tkvi4,t3_pzgn4,null,1428395664,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"What do we need to do? Well we need to collect all examples of official/concept evidence of the Gallifrey language and compile it into in image album, including the non-circular classic stuff. Then we need to speculate on the 'history' of the language- why did it change into the circular (my theory is that they learned about the complexity of time and their language was no longer sufficient).

The main problem I have with fan made Gallifreyan is that they all have this notion of shoving circles into smaller circles to form multiple words or linking the circles together with lines. But if you look at examples, that is not how it's been done on the show. EDIT: Well not in the way this fan has done it. I stand partially corrected.

I assume that one circle is one sentence/idea/""chunk"" and that the angles of the lines, size and placement of the circles, length of the lines, etc. determines meaning. But also, as there are few examples and languages are vast (especially the TL language), we would also need to take creative liberties that also stayed true to the original design but added a layer of cultural depth (deliberately creating grammar irregularities).

More about my grammar speculation here: http://Langue-Skulptur.deviantart.com/journal/The-Gallifreyan-Language-265677389 But I'm pretty much going to say it all here....

We need to figure out by what structure the language will be based: sentence order, any etymology?, verb conjugation, prepositional phrases, and possibly their own made-up grammar constructs. Plus, how will we do this visually? Again back to my idea about the length, placement, angle of lines/circles. But again again- more creative liberties.

There needs to be a system for converting from Gallifreyan to English- do we make a corresponding a= this and b=that language or do we start to create our own dictionary full of words? Do we create an alphabet on which these words are based? If so, we should put in some etymology. Do we do multiple alphabets like the Chinese?

Based on TL societies high-and-mighty mannerisms, there are also going to be different tiers of respect/formality like the Japanese or ""du vs Sie"" like Germans have.

The tenses would also be a lot tougher. English has 16 (sort of), so imagine what a time travelling race could do?

I think that the number six and hexagons will be very important (the TARDIS has a hexagonal console!).

We should add grammatical flairs- capitalization of certain things (germans capitalize nouns), word order should NOT be like English (I'd model it on German or something, probably influenced by honorifics), does this language have genders or a case system (again, tenses could become cases for our time travelling TLs).

And perhaps this Gallifreyan should have it's own ""romanji"". An way of converting the Gallifreyan to the Roman alphabet. But if we do that we cannot just use random crap words with Xs and Qs and apostrophes. Szylek ak telos delap. Or whatever. It should also have an internal coherence... Oh gawd I'm making terms up now. I wish I was Marc Okrand. You get the idea?

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Yup, the Dalek language can be seen on the show. Each Dalek has a sort of ""ID tag"" under it's dome cowl. Each one is different, and it looks kickass. I've got a mockup font that types in the bar-code like stuff. The BBC website has concept art of Dalek DNA that has Dalek writing on it. I saved that to my computer too. :)

So I've got most of the Gallifreyan from the show saved up already. The first thing we should really do before thinking of grammar touches and what not is the stylistic approach. How we draw these things and how the drawing corresponds to words. 

So obviously we've got a bunch of overlapping circles. Is each circle a sentence? Or are they concepts that interact with each other?  Yes! Maybe that's it. Each circle/shape (dented or not) could be a concept. Perhaps depending upon its angle in relation to the largest circle or another circle, determines it's case (nominative, accusative, etc.) or maybe it's tense.

Concept as in ""in the dark"" or ""he goes (swiftly)"". So each circle would be like a sentence fragment. But I'm starting to get the feeling that there aren't really *sentences* in Gallifreyan, just clusters of these circle-concepts. Each cluster could tell us the amount of info in a sentence or perhaps an entire paragraph. I guess it would depend on how much you pack in there.

Still not sure on the placement of the circles in relation to each other though. I'm starting to think about math. Math should definitely be in here. As a joke, concepts/designs related to time should be influenced by the visual representation of things like the golden ratio (1+sqrt5/2). Anyways- maybe the placement of circles in relation to each other could be based off of angle- like unit circles in trigonometry. 30 degrees 180 degrees. It could indicate case/tense.

true,Aesir81,present,Fernando Torres,"I initially predicted that we would get raped by Napoli in a 3-0 loss.  Sadly, my predictions were not far off. 

Save for a lone and highly unprofessional mistake at the back by Napoli, we were entirely devoid of threatening chances.  We did a decent job at keeping offensive possession but only managed a few negligible shots against a side that should have been punished more than once.

Player review:

Cech - Good.  Did what he could and made solid decisions.  Dependable as usual.

Bosingwa - Terrible.  Was I the only one who was halfway excited when he got injured?  At least now AVB can't continue to start one of the worst players on the team.

Ashley Cole - good performance.

Cahill - also a good performance.

Ivanovic - Atrocious.  Save for a lack of goals, he single-handedly lost the game for us by allowing his marker 5-10 yards of space to score two of the three goals against us.

David Luiz - Good performance today.  Make great some great stops in the back, despite one bad clearance that led to a goal.

Miereles - Bad.  Exhibited poor midfield distribution and gave up the other goal against us by giving his marker 10+ yards at the top of the box.

Essien - Decent.  Helped the offensive tempo and possession after coming on.

Lampard - Same as Essien.

Malouda - Average performance, I'd say.  Didn't seem to be able to produce anything offensively, but also did very little losing of possession.  

Drogba - pretty terrible.  Offensively, delivered what I've come to expect from Torres, minus the decent playmaking aspect.

Sturridge - Mostly selfish play that didn't yield much.  While he did participate in a few build-ups, like Drogba, had very few looks at goal.

Mata - Probably the best performance of any player today, despite being once again cast as a winger instead of being able to dictate the tempo of the game from midfield.  Was able to capitalize on the gift from Napoli, so that's always a nice plus.

Based on today, and matches previous, I expect us to be eliminated from the Champion's League in the 2nd leg.",0,1329872595,null,0,true,0,c3tmfr9,t3_pzw65,t1_c3tmfr9,t3_pzw65,null,1428396466,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

He really should only playing around 60 percent of games and preparing to become a starter next year, but due to injuries and lack of quality players he's been thrown into the deep end a little early.

Realistically, in two years, out of the players that played today, the only one's I expect to still be at CFC are:

Luiz

Mata

Torres (He likes it in London, AVB seems to like him, and I don't think anyone will pay anywhere near our asking price for him)

Ramires

Cahill

Sturridge (Although I could see him moving on if we continue like this)

Ivanovic (Maybe)

But I've been doing some testing. I'm thinking that you start with a circle (the main subject). Verbs of the main subject will be smaller and overlap with the main circle half-way through the smaller circle. The location of the verb will determine it's tense (which I just read up on- there are 17 different tenses in english).

Somewhere, I don't know where, maybe inside the circle or scattered across the entire cluster itself will be some kind of pattern of circles and lines that indicate from whose point of view the tense is. From your own personal timeline, from the person you're speaking to, from a historical POV, from someone else's, etc.

So main subject, verb, and tense is at least kind of figured out. How does it sound? Or am I making sense.

I also think that direct object/indirect object should be represented in a circle directly *above* (so 90 degrees) the main circle. Indirect objects will be to the *right* of the main circle (180) degrees. And here's where it gets fun. If *you* are the direct object to something else (whilst also having a direct object of your own) then there will be a circle directly *below* the main circle (270 degrees).

And if there is a direct object of a direct object or a prepositional phrase or whatever they can link onto these direct/indirect objects that are attached to the main circle. This way they'll keep branching outwards from the central circle to form a huge cluster. So besides using the center circle to keep things coherent, there is no specific order in which you read these. It's all about the locations in relation to each other, not the individual symbols (like sheet music- music is like math).

In every regeneration, the cause of it was something immediate and potentially fatal ... the Doctor had no prior warning and only had very little time to rattle off a quick explanation to his companions.

We never had chance to consider the outgoing Doctor's feelings on the matter, just oops, something bad happened, new face, off we go again ...

And since the reboot, I found 9 a ludicrous way to end things ... Rose absorbs the time vortex, flies the TARDIS, kills all the Daleks and faints. The Doctor on the other hand absorbs the vortex for less time before restoring it to the TARDIS, and suddenly ""every cell in my body is dying"" ... I thought Time Lords were made of stronger stuff.

10 was the first one where we actually got to see some depth to the character ... his soul being revealed by Dalek Khan and then being forewarned of his death (rather than it being an accident he had no control over) - remember he even had the choice to leave Wilf where he was in the end.

""Even if I change it still feels like dying. Everything I am dies. Some new man goes sauntering away... and I'm dead.""

That was moving in the extreme, as you get to experience the emotions leading up to a regeneration ... and likewise his final comment ""I don't want to go"".

Supporting a team doesn't mean supporting every decision that they make. You want the best for your team, and if that's not happening it's upsetting, especially when it feels like it doesn't need to be that way.

The reason I personally have a problem with AVB is he makes (what I would consider) crazy decisions and gives no reason why. I know he doesn't have to answer to anyone but Roman, but if AVB is going to keep playing a system that clearly isn't working and giving no reason why, I can't help but be upset. There is little to no transparency.

I know if his crazy decisions worked, he would be hailed as a genius, but they aren't and he looks foolish. I get the feeling that he is stubborn and is trying to force his tactics to work, and would rather see the team fail than admit he was wrong or that he was in over his head.

I see no reason to support him, if I don't think he has the clubs best interests at heart. Maybe it's because he's young and wants to make a name for himself, but I think he is going to try to force HIS system to work until it kills us in hopes that he will get some type of pep guardiola type of acclaim for revolutionizing football.

In the end this is all speculation I have made based on what I have seen of his personality, but I have no reason to believe otherwise because of a lack of transparency in his decisions. All I want to see is him saying, I played X Player because of Y Reason, and if that statement had any sort of sound logic to it I would be happy. If I knew he was doing the best thing for the club I would support him whole-heartedly, but I have my doubts.

I dont really know how I feel about him. Last weekend I would have loved to see him gone, after today I'm 50/50. In my mind the system he played mostly made sense and he made good tactical subs and changes, and it was the players who messed up.",0,1329877149,null,0,true,0,c3tnajo,t3_q07sh,t1_c3tnajo,t3_q07sh,null,1428396869,13,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,13

1. how to indicate if something is a direct/indirect object. What I said before about the 90/180/etc. degrees wouldn't work for the same reason number 2 is a problem:

2. how to indicate prepositions and conjunctions. Just like 1, I shouldn't do it by location of the symbols (30/60/90) because I wanted this to be a cluster right? Well if it's a cluster and all these different circles are overlapping each other, I need to know which circles are actually *interacting* with each other in the sentence and not just coincidentally interlocking for no reason.

So saying that a direct object is right above the main circle wouldn't work because what if there was randomly another circle nearby it?

true,Vexatious,tennant,Tennant,"this comes down to a manner of philosophy. I see the point you're making and I understand completely your reasoning, but the problem lies with when his consciousness breaks.

If you don't mind me getting a little off topic...

Imagine you are cloned like 10 was. They are two separate people, but have the exact same memories. If the original died, is that clone still our Doctor? No, he's his own man with the memories of the original. The original's life ended and his train of thought came to an end.

Now this is similar to teleportation to me. The idea behind teleporters is that it disassembles you, copies your genetic signature, and then rebuilds a new you. There's a lot of controversy over this as to whether or not the person who steps out of the teleporter is you or just a clone of you. The memories are there, but the original person might as well have died.

Now we know regenerations take every cell in his body, including brain cells, and jumble them up to rebuild him and stave off death. If we look at it like teleportation (and that's where ultimately your opinion matters, whether or not you feel its you or a clone of you that comes out) then (from my opinion) the Doctor is no longer himself. He has become just as much a clone of the original as the meta-doctor (that's what he's called right?) is a clone of the real doctor.

So I guess it comes down to your opinion on that, and since it's philosophy and all you're as right as I am. I just feel he dies because it's a clone of him that comes out of the cycle (yes meaning the first doctor was the only ever real one)",0,1329878701,null,0,false,0,c3tnldu,t3_pzk01,t1_c3tnldu,t1_c3tl762,null,1428397011,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The emotions are a part of yourself and to cry is completely fine. You are quite normal, its too bad your parents kicked you out, but I am certain that life will turn around for you. 

The doctor is probably one of the best role models there is because of his emotions and because it shows he is a flawed individual, which we all are, but that's what makes us, us so embrace it. :)
