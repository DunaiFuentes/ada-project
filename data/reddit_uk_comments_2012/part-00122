There was a lot of ""feminist writing"" in the sense of Hunter Dude going ""Women are weak"" and Amy/Nefertiti going ""Nuh-uh"" and that kind of being it. Nefertiti didn't do anything except talk about how she was so kewl and get kidnapped. Brian Williams was a cool idea, but they didn't do enough with it. There was a little conflict with Rory and Brian set up at the beginning, but it didn't go anywhere. 

Also: WHY were the Silurians exiled from Earth in the first place? Did the humans kick them out? Why did no one mention that? Are there any Silurians left?

And yet you feel entitled to have an opinion on what is the finest comedy ever. Astounding.

The office was groundbreaking. It done something that no british comedy had ever done before, it was frankly a masterpiece. On the surface it might look just like a regular sitcom, but when you start looking in to the nuances, what makes the characters tick and realise how utterly flawlessly it was cast it will stand out way ahead of anything else.

The jokes stood or fell sometimes on something as subtle as a change in direction of a characters gaze, which is an incredibly brave and confident thing for a comedy writer to rely on.

The other side of the West Lothian Question is the Sewel Convention - where English MPs are allowed to vote on issues that were actually devolved to the Scottish parliament.

I believe the SNP's Westminster MPs abstain from votes that would fall under the West Lothian Question; the Scottish MPS that do vote on English matters are predominantly Labour (70%) - you should perhaps direct your ire at the Labour Party, since that's their policy.

There is a commission due to report in April 2013 on how best to resolve this issue, although I suspect they may just say ""let's wait until 2014 and see if it resolves itself via the referendum"".

Steam your face well. Try to shave straight after, or even still in, the shower or bath.

Keep a jug of boiling water next to you for rinsing the razor in. The hotter the water, the more easily it washes off the grease and oil that's holding your hair to the blade.

Before each stroke, make a few reverse strokes elsewhere on your body (I go for my inside arm). This smooths out any irregularities on the blade in the same way as sharpening a meat knife on leather does.

After shaving wash the razor in boiling water and pat it dry with a towel, this keeps the blade from rusting.

Grow a beard, you'll never need a razor again.

true,COUNTBLANK,null,null,"My advice is this. 

1) Do your CBT on a hired bike.

2) Start looking for a 125cc geared bike. Buy any one of the well respected Japanese manufacturers (Honda, Yamaha etc). Don’t get anything that looks like a sports bike with all the decals and fairing, they are strictly for chavs. Don’t buy new or nearly new (it won't hold it's value as well). Don't buy Chinese rip-offs. If you can, get someone that knows about bikes to go with you to look potential purchases. Scooters are strictly for enthusiasts, they are a dead end in terms of progression on to bigger and better (plus no one looks good riding a scooter, again - leave them to the chavs/elderly) 

3) Insure the bike 3rd party only. This will be very cheap even without a no claims etc. You ought to get it for less than £200. Why 3rd party only? Anything else is not cost effective – your bike isn’t going to get stolen if you’re careful (see below). Crashing it will be costlier - but when considering the excess that insurance would charge + loss of no claims bonus, you’re better off dealing with damage to a bike under £1000 without getting them involved. 

4) Buy a decent lock and always use it. Disc locks are good because they are easy to carry with you. If you bike isn’t some sporty looking chav-magnet then it ought not to attract anything more than opportunist thieves. The lock should put them off. If you have to park the bike in a risky area for any length of time buy a cover for it.

5) Gear wise, if you’re on a budget, look for a good textile jacked 2nd hand. Textiles are best (opposed to leather) in my opinion because they can be worn in all weathers. Buy the best gloves that you can afford – warm, well protected hands are paramount in importance. I wear army surplus boots – they’re fairly waterproof,  very tough and far cheaper than specialist motorcycle boots. You can wear them off the bike too.

6) Realise biking is awesome, pass your tests, buy something bigger and better. Attract a large amount of respect from your peers and attention from your preferred gender of sexual partner.

There is none - we assume that economic growth will continue, that we won't be subject to invasion, that the major powers (US/EU/China) will move up and down a bit but not hugely so, etc. You can plan for different circumstances, but you do have to assume that the future will be roughly similar to the past.

But supposing Scotland can not sustain itself. We would be faced with the same situation as any other small nation - we would either need to turn to someone larger for help (the EU), or become a failed state while our population starves to death and resorts to cannibalism.

The latter seems a little dramatic, and not very likely. We essentially create as much money as we spend, there is every reason to think we could continue to do so, and very few concrete reasons why we could not.

There are lots of unknowns. If we use the BoE's interest rates, and they increase them to 15%, would we survive? (but if our economy will probably be roughly similar to the rUK in terms of growth, how likely is that?) If the rUK decides to withdraw from the EU, how would that affect us? If the rUK decides to participate in a war in Iran, how would that affect us?

There are issues over separation that would need to be worked out, but so far I have not heard anything insurmountable: it is in nobody's interest (EU, rUK, Scotland) for an independent Scotland to be ""punished"" for wanting to go it alone, so I am sure something mutually beneficial can be worked out.

London is something of a special case in the UK: it generates a lot, but it also consumes a lot. I know some pro-independence people do come to the subject from the POV that the balance of power in the UK is distorted by the south-east (but you can find similar attitudes almost everywhere but the south-east).

Personally I am less interested in how the rUK organises itself than I am in how Scotland organises itself.

We have long-standing issues with infrastructure and public health which have not been resolved by operating within the UK. I believe being independent would force us to face up to those issues, and do so more effectively than we've done to date.

There are lots of other western democracies within the EU with similar populations (Denmark, Slovenia, Finland, Ireland, Slovakia). What is their backup plan? Should they accept accession by a larger country ""just in case""?

On the subject of monthly payments, I think it might make budgeting easier, because as terahurts says it's much easier to see when the money is coming in, and in what quantity. Not only might you have payments coming in at random times, but also outlays. It's pretty difficult to match up a random selection of weekly, fortnightly and monthly incomes with weekly, monthly and quarterly payments, especially when they all occur on different days. In any case, most people with regular income (even if it is benefits) can get access to overdrafts or credit cards to smoothe out small errors in budgeting.

I can also say from personal experience that the present system is a mess from a budgeting perspective. I had variable work, but below the income threshold, so that I could access Housing Benefit and JSA. Every time my income changed, I had to declare it to the local council, who would then halt housing benefit payments for months at a time while they processed the data. Then, after a bit of chasing up, I would get a lump sum making up the payments which had been missed in the meantime. I would also declare the income to the Job Centre, who would take all the money I'd earned off a future JSA payment, lagged by something like 4-6 weeks. That means that you got no extra money for working, and it was a serious accounting exercise to work out how the JSA payments were going to vary week to week. In other words, the consequence of earning a small amount was no extra money and a lot of budgeting hassle. In comparison, monthly payments which responded immediately to changes in income, and which left you with a percentage of the money you'd earned, would have been absolutely wonderful.

If you were renting privately, and you were unable to afford a two, or even a one bedroom place on your own, you would live with someone else. Regardless of 'the lack of one bedroom flats' you would do what countless others do, i.e. house sharing.

You have to appreciate that people who are working  often don't get this luxury of choosing their house.  For example, you live with others in big house shares,  I've even had friends share bedrooms in houseshares with partners to cut costs. Personally, we moved out of London and commute to avoid inflated housing costs.

I do appreciate you trying to be a good dad, that's a great thing, but wanting an extra bedroom for your kids who you do not have custody of, is not the job of the state.

In our case, it's not as if we're going to treat the Scottish as strangers from that point on, but that's also why I wonder about the ramifications (even going begging to the EU would still mean us partly-bailing them out).

It's interesting that you conclude with Ireland - while I'm sure they 100% wouldn't want a union, try asking the Irish how many of them are still currently driving across the border to N. Ireland to buy stuff cheaper; it wasn't long ago that Irish shops were having to guarantee a £1 - €1 exchange rate to try and stop this from happening, and it's *that* sort of situation that worries me.",0,1347280600,null,0,1347282936,0,c663gcn,t3_zlrht,t1_c663gcn,t1_c6631cr,null,1429862935,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

My bet is that they are all on pay-as-you-go, which right now is a rip off system designed to target the poorest amongst us. Get a contract phone, not only do you get a free brand new handset, but for £10 a MONTH on tesco, you get more minutes and texts than most people could reasonably use.

true,epemberton,yorkshire,People's Republic of South Yorkshire,"As much as it sticks in my craw to defend Jeremy Hunt, I don't think he has ever stated that he believes that homoeopathy works through the mechanisms its supporters claim.  If you read the early day motion that he (and several other MPs) signed, it states that it supports homoeopathy for
&gt;chronic difficult to treat conditions such as musculoskeletal and other chronic pain, eczema, depression, anxiety and insomnia, allergy, chronic fatigue and irritable bowel syndrome

The above are all the types of condition for which we often have no alternative medication and which can soak up the resources of GPs as people return time and again to seek a cure which isn't there.  In such situations, it could be argued that they could be fobbed off to a homoeopath at a lower cost (debatable, but worth investigation).  Whilst there is no scientific proof that homoeopathy works better than a placebo, the nature of the homoeopathic approach (long consultations, 'bespoke' remedies etc.) is pretty much fine tuned to maximise the analgesic effect of placebo itself.  For chronic conditions where there are no alternatives, it is possible to argue that homoeopathy has a place in the NHS regardless of its effectiveness through the processes it claims.

I completely understand that this is anathema to some people and I think it has severe ethical issues with regards to the NHS being seen to promote 'alternative' therapies (i.e. if someone were later to take homoeopathic malaria tablets, for example).  But if people have issues with placebos being prescribed under the auspices of the NHS, I would suggest that the handing out of SSRIs is more damaging, given their terrible side effects and the increasing amount of meta data which is pointing towards their medically insignificant benefit above placebo.  Or doctors shooing away troublesome patients with a viral infection by giving them a course of antibiotics just because they want a quiet life.

As far as I can see, Jeremy Hunts support of homoeopathy is not based on his poor understanding of science, but of a fundamental attachment to 'patient choice' being at the heart of healthcare.  It is this ideology that colours all Tory healthcare policy, from widening private sector influence to pursuing the entirely boneheaded concept of GP led commissioning.  It is for these beliefs that he should be attacked and not for whatever stance he may or may not hold when it comes to homoeopathy.

Apologies for the rant, but I get frustrated when issues get muddied by people so keen to oppose the government that they don't look beyond the headlines.

Want to buy new trains? The government gets involved, and after many years Hitachi might start building some any time soon.

Makes you wonder how the freight train operators get on with things, they don't have anywhere near the same government micromanagement.

Seriously? Have you seen how amazing Mikel has been playing the latter part of last season and this season? IMO there's not a better player in the prem at touching and turning, and holding the ball in tight situations surrounded by multiple opposition players. [Here's a video from 2010/11. He's doing things like this and better every single time he gets the ball this season so far](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T-7T2rza3k).  I enjoy watching a player do things like that more-so than watching Messi or Ronaldo prancing about.  It's football at it's purest. I forgot what the exact stat was, but in one of our previous game he went something like 60 minutes without giving away possession once, and having 30 odd consecutive completed passes. 99 percent of the time this guy will make the right choice in pass, turn, or whatnot..and that is a damn important thing for our team to have. That is simply amazing. I've only ever seen a handful, maybe even less than 5, of players in the last 10 or so years who can do what he does on the ball in the position he plays; Viera, Makelele, Pirlo. What's more is that those 3 players have something in common. They didn't peak until the end of their careers. The 'makelele' role relies a lot on experience. More so than probably most other positions on the pitch. For him to show the quality he's shown for us already, at the age of 25, is amazing. That means he's playing at a level only just below the most reveared DM's, and still has a good 4 years until he is at his best; hopefully.


[Compare that video of Mikel to this one of Makelele. While Makelele obviously has more speed, experience, and better marking...you can see that their style is almost identical, and Mikel isn't far off.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaB6OsC2qdI)",0,1347285352,null,0,1347286331,0,c6647a7,t3_zk44d,t1_c6647a7,t1_c65h5xl,null,1429863288,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Don't disagree with you there, but while I had access pre-completion there was no substantial building works going on, mostly final touches and decorating. Nothing that really needed PPE. The bit that makes it worse is that while the project was signed off, there was still plenty of last minute work going on - the only difference is that no one was wearing PPE.
 
It's not like I'm trying to say that I shouldn't need PPE while the ceiling is going in or people are using cranes to put AC on the roof - just that I thought that for the work that was going on while I was on site I don't think a hat, jacket and steel toe-cap boots are going to protect me.

 Hate comes so easily to him, and love so hard- he's almost content to ditch his companions or use stupid excuses to get rid of them when he's tired of them. Look at Donna, that was a HUGE plot hole. 
But the thing about the Doctor is that he looks for approval- as OP said. He tries to make the people around him smile and think he's amazing. And since he uses good people as his lens for the universe, he takes on that goodness. 
The doctor knows the difference between good and evil, but finds it almost impossible to tread the line without help- and that's why the Doctor, traveling alone, is the scariest concept in the DW universe.
For instance: Waters of Mars. Donna for a while had mellowed the doctor, holding him back and telling him 'you can stop now.' But after Donna was gone, the Doctor unhinged. When he saw a situation he didn't like, KNOWING it was a fixed point and he could potentially screw up the entire universe, the Doctor got a bug in his arse and decided the rules didn't apply to him. 
Of course, he got handed that idea back on a platter of Time Lords being scared dickheads.
Then he died regretting his pride- causing his next regeneration to be really, really insecure. But this new Doctor also has the potential to be the most dangerous.

Thing is, I've lived on beans &amp; rice. And if I was unemployed I could raise my kids on the same. But it's not as easy as you and others are claiming.

Simply because you managed it for a few months while being a student, doesn't mean it is that straight forward to do the same for growing children.  

Don't forget to take into consideration insane food inflation. When I was broke loaves were practically given away in supermarkets, now, they cost £1.40 on average. Same price jump with beans, same with tinned tomatoes.   £2.14 doesn't go very far at all.


As for jobs to get out of the poverty trap, well I've just hired a graduate for a minimum wage post. The locals who quit school at 16, don't stand much of chance against that sort of competition.

I have no horse in this race, I don't think we can afford to give people more at the moment, but I take exception to people claiming it's easy to raise a growing child on 2 quid a day.",0,1347286211,null,0,false,0,c664cvd,t3_zliex,t1_c664cvd,t1_c66440w,null,1429863359,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Mischieftess,tardis,TARDIS,"I really like the start to this episode – the alarm clock, tousled Rose, the “everyday London” snapshots (reminds me a bit of the Sherlock BBC opening in places). It sets up her relationship with her mother, her somewhat lighthearted, simple relationship with simple, lighthearted Mickey (snrk), and her situation when the Doctor appears. She’s got a job and makes money, but it isn’t fulfilling. Let’s face it – in a situation where something out of this world enters into your life, would any of us refuse the lure to do something (and be something) far beyond what we’ve experienced so far?

One thing that I’ve always appreciated about Rose is that she reacts to abnormal situations like a real person. She experiences and expresses shock, fear, and confusion and combats them with an underlying determination and drive to somehow, anyhow, make it right or escape. She doesn’t sit around after meeting the Doctor and escaping the mannequins – she goes and looks for answers from Clive. 

Yet, she obviously wants to like the Doctor. There’s no way around this – he doesn’t try to win her over, he’s scary old/freaky, and he’s dangerous; but these factors don’t shake Rose from her interest. From even this early point, it’s made clear that she sees something in him that draws her to him. His playfulness, enthusiasm, and wonderful arrogance do much to combat his darker aspects. 

I’d forgotten how fun the 9th Doctor can be. He’s really sold the “brilliant egocentric wandering alien” so quickly in this episode. 

Oh dear, Mickey and the shuffling sticky man-eating trashcan. This episode sure teaches you to fear the unexplained. I also like that plastic!Mickey doesn’t understand why Mickey’s brain would use loving endearments, which is why it messes up so badly when talking to Rose. Nice detail, RTD.

I love it when a companion points out the obvious to a Doctor, as we see here with Rose and the Eye of London. I feel like all of the Doctors “ask” for help in this way: 

Doctor: “mutter mutter [PROBLEM] (muttered complicated reasoning)” 

Companion: “What, you mean something like that?”

Doctor: “Yes! Exactly! You’re brilliant! I’m brilliant!”

Companion: “Oh dear off he goes again.”

This really plays to our egotism as humans. “Well, the Doctor is brilliant, but look the companion has common sense!” Again, RTD makes a good play on our predispositions.

RTD has the reins to restart Doctor Who, but this episode isn’t about the Doctor. It isn’t about the Nestine Consciousness. The name of this episode is Rose, and Rose is the central figure kicking off this story. And it makes sense – Rose is our liason to the universe of the Doctor and RTD is the hidden narrator that puts our focus on her again and again. It’s a good thing I like her!

Also of note: someone got [jealous](http://i.imgur.com/TqRe2.jpg) while I was watching. Poor kitty. She came and sat on me later, so all is forgiven (I hope).

Payday loan companies offer a service that, for many people who use it, they aren't able to get anywhere else (without going to loan sharks). To ban them would be asinine.

The atronomical APR is a red herring, as loans are typically repaid after one or two days, with a maximum of 30. Secondly, the astronomical APR is also due to these being unsecured personal loans for people who do not have a good credit score (due to being unemployed, or simply not being very good at paying back debts). This kind of lending is probably the riskiest kind that a lender could make short of sending it to Nigerian princes, and with default rates at around 10-20%, high APR is their only option in order to stay in business.

Arguments promoting legislation against these companies are incredibly short sighted.

EDITED TO ADD: I think there's also an element of what happens to The Doctor when he isn't traveling with someone. In The Runaway Bride, Donna tells him that she can't stay with him, but that he needs to find someone to keep him in check because of the recent events I mentioned.

We all remember what happened to Ten when he wasn't traveling with someone between series 4 and 5. The whole ""Time Lord Victorious"" I-can-change-whatever-I-want-and-damn-the-consequences Doctor. 

In one of the ""Inside the TARDIS"" specials on the series 5 set, he tells Amy that the reason he travels with someone is because he alone can't see the wonder of things. Paraphrased, ""when you have all of time and space as your backyard, that's all you have: a back yard. But you, you can see it.""

And he has been traveling alone for a while now, just dropping in to grab Amy and Rory (or in the case of Asylum, getting captured with them). He hasn't seen the wonder for a while now.

So, on top of his already violent history, he's likely to become more violent.

Even if he had been traveling with someone all this time, I don't think killing Solomon was out of character, but when you add his loneliness to the equation, it's practically expected. It has been shown to be a major part of the Doctor's character that he becomes more violent and less caring, more megalomaniacal, when traveling alone.",0,1347288799,null,0,1347291670,0,c664vn8,t3_zn3wl,t1_c664vn8,t1_c664t9i,null,1429863613,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

RyanAir *do* have a reputation for being the lowest-price in many instances. They also *do* have a reputation for being nit-picking and catching out unsuspecting travellers (particularly non-EU passengers who almost always end up paying for another flight the first time they travel - see [RyanAir's special conditions for non-EU passengers](http://www.ryanair.com/en/questions/non-eu-eea-passengers-document-check-requirements-for-online-check-in) and a [string of non-EU customers that were refused onto an aircraft and had to buy a new ticket](http://www.ihateryanair.org/ryanair-visa-check-scam/)).

I, personally, will choose EasyJet over RyanAir whenever possible. I very much look forward to [EasyJet's proposed allocated seating policy](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19486460). I almost prefer their Flexi-fares to Standard-fares because once you sum up all the extras that you get for free with the Flexi-fare it can sometimes work out to be a good deal - without penalties for changing dates.

Same argument could be offered to support any number of activities.

The reason it applies to everything is because it totally ignores the problems created and looks at it purely from the perspective of supply and demand.

No, the APR goes on well past the maximum limit. That is the problem, because through no fault of their own some people can't make the repayment in time, and a £100 advance turns into thousands of pounds of debt.

So actually the onus is to prove something safe rather than dangerous. Furthermore, the I doubt the process was to think, ""Right, corner shops, how can we legislate them?"" Rather, various activities have risks, and any place of employment that carries out those activities has to ensure they are carried out safely. Worth noting that safety doesn't just cover falling/tripping/drowning, but also long term issues from long periods of working in a single job - e.g. RSI, back issues, joint damage.

So, sitting a person at a till or desk has risks. Moving boxes, unpacking etc, installing electrical equipment, butcher's counters (half my local corner shops have those now) etc all have risks. These have been well established and evaluated. So the questions are: Have these activities been proven safe (well no ...)? Are they specifically safe in a corner shop context (no evidence given)? What is the actual cost of H&amp;S burden on these corner shops (no evidence given ...)?

Maybe the report will cover some of this info, though I doubt any of it will reach the media. OTOH most of the government reports I've glanced at have been pretty depressingly poor with regards the research/evidence/modelling side.

I don't argue that the H&amp;S system is perfect. I'm sure there are many inefficiencies, as happens with a system that has been jerry rigged over time and suffers from mission creep. But I'd like to hear evidence if people's lives are going to be put at risk.

The *problem* is that some people look down on those with disabilities, but instead of tackling the problem at its source (or just acknowledging that some people will always view a lack of ability as something uncomplimentary), well-meaning people frequently try to fix that by changing the *name* that we give to people with disabilities.  However, that's putting a linguistic sticking-plaster over the real problem - it solves nothing, and after a small amount of time the intolerance and prejudice leaks through, and then people try to stick *another* temporary sticking plaster over it again.  Changing the word does nothing to tackle the bigotry at the core of the problem.

""Moron"" was a value-neutral medical term, but it became an insult so doctors started using ""retarded"" (meaning ""developmentally retarded"" - ""held-back in development"") instead.  Then that became pejorative, so they moved to ""educationally subnormal""... or ""developmentally delayed""... and then ""special needs""... and then just ""special"".  Now even *that's* an insult amongst kids.

I haven't seen a new euphemism arise by consensus yet, but when it does you can be sure it'll only be a few months (if that) before kids and offensive people start using it to insult each other.

Much of this process is driven by people (both members and non-members of the described group) trying to avoid people giving offence, but it's simply impossible and likely unsustainable - the list of offensive words only grows larger as time goes on, and attention must be paid/considerable offence is given *unintentionally* when each new ""offensive"" word is replaced by its (for now) inoffensive euphemism and various people don't get the memo in time.

The urge to retreat from newly pejorative terms into ever-more-ridiculous euphemisms is understandable, but I think the approach taken by (to pick an example at random) gay culture is better - push back, reclaim offensive words (""queer"", ""fag"", etc) as their own, largely agree on what are ""offensive"" and what are ""allowed"" terms, and call people who persistently use the offensive ones shitheads and bigots.",0,1347292040,null,0,1359043368,0,c665ln9,t3_zna16,t1_c665ln9,t1_c663x89,null,1429863947,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

""Do you understand what I mean when I say 'we grant words the power that they have'?

I could take a word at random, lets say 'reddit'. Now I could go up to a disabled person and call them 'a reddit!' in an offensive manner.

On it's own that means pretty much nothing, but if other people hear this and join in, the concept of the word being offensive gains traction... society has just granted a word power. People like yourself will start to shout down anyone who uses the word, people will feel emotional distress when they hear it etc.

But why? It can be stopped by having the strength as a community to ignore its offensive power.

It can, although a normal loan you would normally secure something against it, so if you can't pay it back then that is the thing that is repossessed.  It's easier knowing the risks that way.

Maybe some solutions to the problem would be a progressive APR (or the opposite of progressive - ie 15% on month 1, 10% on month 2, etc) where the amount that it accrues does not spiral out of control.  This would limit the liability for the customer whilst securing the profit for the company.

People in both of those places may keep you appraised of the metal scene here. You may also wish to hang out at The Hatchet, but the clientèle seem less 'alternative' these days.

As far as boisterous Goths / rivetheads go, you'll find a few of us about. Alas, the scene regularly implodes due to drama (amazing, I know) so sometimes you'll see the various aforementioned pubs full of us and sometimes there is ne'er a badly-dyed black hair (or day-glo dreadlock) in sight.

Well if someone is intentionally using words they know are hurtful, then it's tautological to say that they're not interested  in a deep and meaningful heart-to-heart about how their choice of language causes upset to the group in question.

What is more meaningful and productive is to get to the core of why they want to hurt said group, not waste your time and theirs by asking them if they realize they're being hurtful.

You seem to be content with ensuring that people with hateful and bigoted views simply keep their views to themselves in polite company.   ""Let them say niggers and fags all they want, just not around gays and blacks"" is what I'm getting from you.  Personally I'm  much more interested in trying to get people to not hate than I am in simply getting them to keep hateful thoughts to themselves.

true,Engineer_Ninja,tennant,Tennant,"Honestly, I was not at all surprised by The Doctor's actions in DoaS. Everyone assumes that The Doctor is a paragon of perfection, but from a non-emotional, non-subjective standpoint, he's more like a big ball of wibly-wobly, rage-y wage-y, stuff, especially when angered. To use his own words, ""Sweet? Maybe. Passionate? I suppose. But don't ever mistake that for nice."" This was said while letting the Absorbaloff thing die, and for killing far fewer people than Space Filch.

But back to my original point about how I wasn't surprised, The Doctor's M.O. (besides being fired at a planet and fixing it) has always been to give the bad guys a chance to do the right thing (""I'm not here to kill it. I'm here to give it a chance."" -""Rose"", Series 1 Ep. 1, moments before killing the Nestene consciousness). In DoaS, he gave Space Walder Frey ample opportunity to do the right thing and help save the ship, and even fixed his legs. And what does Solomon do? He takes Nefertiti hostage (and suggests he'll rape her) and kills Tricy, amongst other things (committing genocide on the Silurians ought to be listed high amongst his other charges, but I'm focusing on his post-meeting-The-Doctor actions). He had invoked the fury of the Time Lord, and I knew that he would inevitably meet the same fate as those who had come before.

Now, I was *slightly* disappointed that The Doctor killed him via nuclear missiles. I would've preferred maybe something along the lines of taking him to the Silurians from ""Then Hungry Earth"" for trial (and inevitable execution). But this wasn't the first time The Doctor kind of skipped past the established judicial system, and honestly a quick death is probably preferable to an eternity of torture, a la ""The Family of Blood.""",0,1347295003,null,0,false,0,c666b6h,t3_zn3wl,t1_c666b6h,t3_zn3wl,null,1429864347,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

Our play last year was based around the counter-attack a lot, lead by Ade bringing the wingers (Bale/Lennon) into play. With this different system of 4-3-3, certain players won't fit the formation as well as others. The 4-3-3 works on a defensive based player (Sandro/Parker), a deep lying playmaker (Dembele), and an offensive midfielder (Sig). The front three are made up of a target man (Ade), an out-and-out winger on the left (Bale, or Mata/Valera when AVB applied the formation at Chelsea/Porto) and a support striker who plays on the right and comes inside to support the main striker (Dempsey/Sturridge/Hulk). As the support striker moves inside during an attack, this enables Sigurdsson to move forward in the right channel (where he had most of his success at Swansea).

The problems come when people take them out:

1. for stupid shit they don't need
2. when they don't know whether or not they can pay them back
3. when they can't actually pay them back at all and know this
4. to paper over the fact they spend more money than they earn and that this is unsustainable

It should be noted that all of these are equally applicable to many other lines of credit that are available.

There is a good reason that mainstream banks do not offer them or a product like them.

Each has a small set of frequencies it can operate on, and for each frequency a limited set of channels. Adding more frequencies in a metro area is *hard* because they must be assigned in such a way neighboring cells (which in metro areas are much lower power and far greater in quantity) minimize crosstalk on each others' frequencies (for nerds, its the [graph colouring problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_colouring_problem)).

Also in an environment like this, introducing a new cell has a domino effect on neighbouring cells, I don't know quite to what extent, but I imagine even adding a small transmitter inside e.g. an airport terminal might result in frequency reconfiguration in neighbouring cells propagating across the rest of the island.

The end result is a hard physical limit on the amount of bandwidth a company can cram in a small area without investing shittonnes (like, billions) on extra licenses (which may not even exist) to get access to enough spectrum to produce more channels.

And no wonder these agents push the sales so hard--their wages are docked if they don't keep up with their quota. I would not be surprised if much of the paperwork they have is simply forged in order to inflate their performance figures.

Why?  The principles are the same - you don't pay up and the company comes around and collects its debt.  If it is secured then they'll collect what you secured it against (house, boat, car, etc) if it is unsecured they'll come round and collect stuff they can sell for the value of the loan.

Fake Mickey is scary - he's the doppelganger, which is historically a really common terrifying trope.

I did like the glimpse into his potential acting ability there, and Rose's distrustful, confused anger at the Doctor for yanking plastic!Mickey's head off and wiring it into the Tardis made sense in the context of her personality.

You're right about there not being much of an introduction of the Doctor. Maybe they assumed that people watching would be familiar with the concept and just take him in stride.

&gt;So, it appears to me as if their target audiences do not overlap as you claim.

That doesn't mean anything. You can still get denied payday loans. The people who go to loan sharks don't only go because they don't like the look of Wonga.com. The target audiences absolutely do overlap, I don't see how you can claim they do not. Both avenues offer cash advances, and they both target people who need cash advances.

&gt;Again, the problem is not how APR affects the original loan within the lending time, it is how it affects it after getting compounded after that.

*This is how loans work*. Short term loans are meant to be short term, and applying 'normal' interest rates to them means the interest charged will be miniscule and nowhere near cost-effective for the lender. If you start lengthening loans over longer periods then the obvious result is dramatic rises in charges. It's the nature of the beast. How do you get around high charges incurred if payments are continually not met? Well, you could either just stick to your credit agreement in the first place, or possibly have the lenders implement some kind of progressive interest system (it was mentioned elsewhere in the thread).

true,atra0,mcgann,McGann,"Okay, this is how i have been interpreting this....nuance of a sequence:

* During The Impossible Astronaut, 1,103 year old version of The Doctor is shot by the River in the suit. He begins to regenerate. She shoots him again, and more or less kills him there. 
* They all meet up in the soda shop with the 909 year old version of The Doctor and continue on to 1969. 
* During this time period The Doctor meets up with the Justice Department in their fancy shape-shifting ship the Teselecta.
* Also during this time he pieces together exactly why everyone is mad at him when they first meet him in the soda shop. 

~~This is where my theory comes in:

* The Doctor now knowing all of what is going on in his future, and their past, heads to Lake Silencio ahead of his future self, inside of the Teselecta, or at least a similar vehicle.
* In The Wedding of River Song, a version of River that knows about the Fixed Point of The Doctors Death, somehow obtains the space suit, and re-wires it for her control. 
* This River drains the weapons system, plunging all of time and space into perpetual 5:02 in the afternoon. 
* The Doctor suit is taken into this alternate time(less) line along with everyone else. 
* While it is 5:02, They go up to the top of Area 52, where River shows The Doctor the distress beacon she's been embarrassing him with.
* The Doctor inside of The Doctor suit, ""marries"" River Song, and time starts to advance. We see flashes back to the original event, where The Doctor is killed, as all the necessary elements for the fixed point have been met. 

Provided that i am correct in my interpretations the reason for his ""regeneration"" is that The Doctor was actually there, but in more of an ""echoed"" form, from how the events were meant to take place. The Doctor ""suit"" wasn't actually at Lake Silencio, it was at Area 52. Further, the River at Area 52 was not in the space suit. Since the TARDIS is clearly seen behind him inside of the suit's eye, him escaping the alternate timeline during the transition between the two universes would more or less be a piece of cake. Leaving his echoed body to be burned on the lake, and hypothetically being capable of even returning the Justice Department's vehicle at the same time, to remove any amount of evidence of his escape.

They are merely sold as 'short term'. yet the loan continues indefinitely. They are in fact long term loans, with astronomical interest rates, that you can optionally decide to pay off in the short-term.

Firstly, the nickname ""Predator"" was new to the Doctor too, he hadn't even heard it. It could've even come about since the Paradigm Daleks left Earth.

Why would the Daleks not remembering be ridiculous? The reason for it makes sense.

The title of *Dinosaurs on a Spaceship* doesn't even appear until after the Doctor **explicitly says those exact words** and we see two coming *straight towards them*. How this ruins the surprise I'm not sure.

The Doctor was in Egypt with Nefertiti before everything started. She insisted on coming, but he was trying to convince her not to. As for Riddell, he's just someone he knows that we haven't seen before. No problem with that.

Amy's interaction with the computer was mostly guessing that happened to work.

Of course, it could also be argued he was making a small sacrifice to conquer a larger threat. I think it was a bit dark, because even if he could have destroyed those daleks, there would still be quite a few left who could exterminate whatever they pleased (with no Doctor to stop them, potentially).

true,Memoriae,eng-Cambridgeshire,Cambridgeshire,"The principles may appear the same to you, however they are quite different.

A secured loan is secured against the retail value of an item. Doesn't matter what item it is, but it generally needs to have a value deemed as ""acceptable"" by that business as something they can issue a loan again.

Unsecured loans are inherently riskier, as there is nothing of a particular value guaranteed to be in the debtor's possession that will cover the loan if they default, especially in the cases of home improvement loans, or holiday loans (which are massively frowned upon). Because there's no guarantee that the debtor will have anything to cover the loan, the increase in APR is justified by the increased risk, and the largely decreased (in the case of secured vs unsecured loans) timescales for repayment. This same model scales all the way down to payday loan companies.


About the wording on mortgages, this is legally required, as somehow there's a misconception that a defaulted mortgage is handled the same way as a defaulted loan.

The processes from the creditor's side are the same. They pass the account to a 3rd party (in the case of mortgages, this will be a legal team) who will either work with the debtor and come to an agreement for both sides, or will issue legal proceedings to allow them to repossess items to cover the loan. Secured loans are (I believe) restricted to the item they are secured against, whereas unsecured loans will cover items that when sold with reasonable expectations, will repay the loan in full.  
If you're looking at the face of them, the unsecured loan is actually harsher when defaulted than the secured loan, because of the scopes.

A tin of tomatoes is still 30p, and let's not forget that child benefit is a *supplement*, and there's other benefits at play.

I'm not saying it is living the high life, by any means, but let's keep it in context.  We're talking about kids not getting enough food here.  Granted even that I'm going back a couple of years to when I did it, there's been students here that have spoken up to say that they can do the same thing, on the same budget now, and still eat interesting healthy food. 

 Someone else has added that they have family in the same situation and they laugh at the idea that they're going hungry.  Bad outlook? Yes.  More should be done?  Yes.   Kids going hungry or having to be dirty?  No.

Nobody is saying it is going to be easy, as in stress free, but putting food in a kid's belly kinda is.

I'm not being flippant about it.  I know that I spend more on Whiskey than their kid's weekly budget is - and I'm by no means tanking it away or fit for AA.    I know McD's and F&amp;C's are out of the question from a shop, and every kid should have them once in a while.  It's part of being a kid.  It remains that if you're being slapped by life then your children still have the money to put food in them.  Enough to keep them healthy if spent right. 

As for hiring people, I used to hire people too.  What I do know is that a non-graduate makes for a better employee, in general, for a ~minimum wage spot.  More so if they're on working credit. I wouldn't underrate the less qualified by any means, especially if the task doesn't require a graduate.  I'd even go as far to recognise that over-qualification plays a part here.

I don't think it's easy raising a kid full stop.  What I do think is possible is for a parent to feed a kid on the extra money they are given, and from the article to keep them clean.  If they said they were having trouble paying electricity bills after they had cleaned their kids and fed them, a priority, then I'd have more arguments to defend them.

It's astounding how many people attempt or complete suicide.

I am currently placed in a small district hospital to give an idea of scale.

I just want to offer a little extra something to anyone reading this who has lost someone by suicide, which sadly will be many people.

It's important to keep in mind that there aren't always warning signs, and there isn't always anything you can do to stop someone even if you know they are suicidal. It's easy to say get help but in a realistic situation that can actually be very difficult.

I'm not saying don't try, but don't feel it is a failure on your part if you don't manage to help them.

If someone close to you does complete suicide and ends their life, it is important not to play the blame game and torment yourself with these signs, or possibilities. Suicide is preventable, but for some people, they will make it their only goal and die regardless.

true,tusksrus,cnty-uk,Manchester,"&gt;The ‘Anti-Pornography’ Filter
 ISPs might be demanded to block pornographic content by default, unless their customers have opted out. Unless it was somehow limited only to X-rated sites, pornography is subject to interpretation, as is any rating system that applies – it could include textbook illustrations, cartoons, keywords, etc. Imagine if the average school library filter was applied to the wider Internet.
 But this isn’t the reason I’m concerned about this idea. I suspect the true motive is the regulation of what gets communicated over the Internet, and the capability to block other content at short notice.

Besides the fact the government has no such plans...

http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/slippery-slope.html

&gt;The Slippery Slope is a fallacy in which a person asserts that some event must inevitably follow from another without any argument for the inevitability of the event in question. In most cases, there are a series of steps or gradations between one event and the one in question and no reason is given as to why the intervening steps or gradations will simply be bypassed. This ""argument"" has the following form: 

&gt;Event X has occurred (or will or might occur). 
Therefore event Y will inevitably happen. 

&gt;This sort of ""reasoning"" is fallacious because there is no reason to believe that one event must inevitably follow from another without an argument for such a claim. This is especially clear in cases in which there is a significant number of steps or gradations between one event and another.
&gt;[...]
&gt;""We've got to stop them from banning pornography. Once they start banning one form of literature, they will never stop. Next thing you know, they will be burning all the books!""

It's the same argument some people use against gay marriage.

&gt;As I pointed out before, people are more likely to use a VPN or proxy than put their names on a pornography list, and we could expect to see this countermeasure becoming standard. Tim Loughton, who was until recently a head of the UK Council for Child Internet Safety (UCCIS), was quoted in The Register as saying:
‘There is a cottage industry of people, mostly operating outside the UK, continually creating and proliferating proxy websites that provide links to adult and harmful content.’
 A comment that’s factually and demonstrably incorrect. Those of us who operate proxies aren’t running any ‘cottage industry’, and neither have I encountered any such service that provides links to ‘adult and harmful content’.

So, no, I'm not shopping in the wrong places - food costs have risen significantly in the past few years, while benefits have frozen or reduced.

&gt;Someone else has added that they have family in the same situation and they laugh at the idea that they're going hungry

He has a car. Shopping is cheap with a car. Without one you rely on the local shop or supermarkets that deliver, for a 1 or 2 days food charge. A market may be a lot cheaper, but then there's bus fare there and back - nearly a fiver in Leeds, or two days food...

&gt;  If they said they were having trouble paying electricity bills after they had cleaned their kids and fed them, a priority, then I'd have more arguments to defend them.

That's the other point -[ fuel poverty](http://timetric.com/index/uk_cpi_electricity_gas_+_misc_energy/) will lead to actual food poverty. When you're on a paypoint meter card you don't get a chance to run up a debt, you pay as you use, and you pay more per unit than we do paying by debit.  

When you look at the real cost of living in the UK, with inflation busting food, energy and transport cost rises and ever reducing benefits, I can sympathise with the POV that £15 isn't enough to feed a kid. You can't, despite spending more on Whiskey than they do on food.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;We don't need the google car to reduce the number of drivers on the road.

Why do we need to reduce the number of drivers on the road? The main problem with lots of drivers on the road is that humans suck at driving.

&gt;Think of all the metal, tech, petrol and infrastructure

* Iron is the [most abundant element on the planet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements#Abundance_of_elements_in_the_Earth) so we don't need to worry about that.
* Tech in cars is fairly trivial and easy to replace compared to other systems.
* Petrol (or fuel in general) is going to be problem no matter what method of transport you are using. Improvements in renewable energy sources will eventually (soon?) make this irrelevant.
* Infrastructure for cars already exists whereas infrastructure for other transport methods needs to be built.

&gt;along with the external costs of insurance, tax, 20k road deaths and injuries

* If the cars, which are statistically ""better"" at driving than humans are driving themselves then insurance will be extremely cheap.
* Tax is used for the maintainence of the infrastructure. If public transport was the main method of transport then this tax would need to be replaced with another tax.
* Road deaths/injuries would be greatly lessened by automated driving systems which have already been proven to be statistically better at driving than humans.

&gt;Quite often we find miles long queues of combustion engines three lanes wide. 

Which is almost always because humans are terrible at driving. 

&gt;Something like 30 billion is spent on new cars each year.

Then don't buy a new car if you can't afford one? There are *tons* of perfectly good second hand cars on the market.

&gt;The Department of Transport has a budget of 12 billion.

Last time I checked, the DoT manage public transport as well.

---

I'm all for a better public transport system but it just can't replace the task that current private transport does. We should be working on improving both systems.

I just don't buy it. Besides blatantly crossing over his own time stream, I don't know what the doctor expected to happen.

Secondly, I find Rose more aggravating then usual in this episode. How brazenly she ignores the Doctor's guidance. I understand it was her father, but I still think she acted childish and obnoxious the whole episode.

You mean the cars which Google have driving around on **pre-existing roads right now** in the US don't exist? As for it not being available right now, we're talking about future development. Improving the public transport system in the future will *also* cost billions, the only difference is that improvement of public transport requires planning and a ton of bureaucracy. Have you seen all of the problems with extending airports? That is *exactly* what will happen if we need to extend any other form of public transport.

&gt;The running cost of mass public transport is far less, which is one reason why local authorities in combination with oil companies had the tracks ripped up.

Ignoring your conspiracy bullshit, it may be cheaper if you live in a major city but who's going to send a train out to a random village that only has a few residents?

&gt;I'll make the point as explicitly as I can: there is enough money, production and technology to have mass public transit. It is a total possibility, just without the political will nor public mindset.

Public transport can *not* replace the current system with enough efficiency to replace all of the conveniences of the current system.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; You mean the cars which Google have driving around on pre-existing roads right now in the US don't exist?

Again point missed. 30 million people would have to buy automated cars. The 30m automated cars don't exist yet. Trams would also utilise roads. That shows that the argument ""we can't have public transport because the infrastructure isn't practical or affordable"" can at least be contested, but is definitely short sighted.

&gt; Have you seen all of the problems with extending airports? That is exactly what will happen if we need to extend any other form of public transport.

This is a false equivalence and one of the poorest arguments. Airports benefit the rich most. People would get behind something like the tram if executed correctly.

&gt; Ignoring your conspiracy bullshit

Go pick up a history book (or start with [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy)). It happened, and the same pressures were at play [in the uk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeQt6ozmpkc&amp;feature=gv). (Currently researching other sources.)

&gt; send a train out to a random village that only has a few residents?

There is such a thing as light rail, but my guess would be the same people that pay for roads to be built. The difference between a road and a tram system is about 40cm of steel.

&gt; Public transport can not replace the current system with enough efficiency to replace all of the conveniences of the current system.

Yes it can. One prolonged oil crisis would be enough, but practically it certainly could compete. Just think of all the subsidies that are afforded to the car: car parks, the suburbs, out of town shopping malls, motorway services, petrol stations, police, etc, etc. The car is awfully inefficient, and I contest it is even convenient when the average urban speed is barely reaching 15mph at some times of the day. Cars are not convenient, they are expensive, hard to store, expensive to insure, expensive to maintain, expensive to park, difficult to learn,  expensive to learn, and so on.

&gt; Public transport needs to be cost efficient for the population as a whole whereas private transport only needs to be cost efficient for the owner of the method of transport.

And that is the trick industrialists play. There was a time that the street car functioned perfectly fine for a mode of mass transport. It was only the rich that had access to the first cars, but of course the first roads where already filled with trams which posed a considerable obstacle, both physically and also economically to the burgeoning oil/car manufacturing. The most egregious example of a deliberate crippling of public transport I have come across are pointless low bridges that were built to deny bus access to some suburban areas (in the US). The self centred consumer had to be fabricated over a number of decades after WW2.

APR is a terrible way of analysing the cost of these loans. Typically, the true interest cost over the loan period (28 days ish) is 25%.

true,rtuck99,null,null,"The problem with public transport is that it's much much slower than cars. My journey to work takes about 3x longer if I use public transport.
The reason for this is that public transport using fixed routes, ie buses trams and trains, can't provide point to point journeys.

Google car solves this. A network of google cars means I don't have to own a car, I can car pool effectively because I can just request a journey immediately using my phone and the nearest available car will pick me up.
Higher occupancy means less traffic, fewer vehicles, electric vehicles (centralised charging), therefore emissions free, cheaper (because no drivers), more productive (I can work in my car), 
Google can predict traffic and use the road more effectively and safely, so fewer jams and accidents.
There's no worries about missing the last train or bus because it's driverless, and there are no unions to go on strike. Oh, and I can put all my shopping in the boot.
Since cars only last about 10 or 15 years, this can be deployed in that timeframe once the tech is available.

If you can't see how driverless cars are superior and will totally revolutionise transport, then you simply haven't thought about it hard enough.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;30 million people would have to buy automated cars.

New cars are introduced and old ones are scrapped all the time. There would be a transitional period where some people are using automated vehicles and some people are using non-automated vehicles. It would probably be an even faster transitional period than current car lifecycles as driverless cars have already been proven as safer than human drivers which means that insurance would cost less which lowers the barrier to entry.

&gt;Trams would also utilise roads. That shows that the argument ""we can't have public transport because the infrastructure isn't practical or affordable"" can at least be contested, but is definitely short sighted.

I'll be able to get a tram from my door all the way to work? Somehow I doubt that such a system would be affordable.

&gt;This is a false equivalence and one of the poorest arguments. Airports benefit the rich most. People would get behind something like the tram if executed correctly.

You completely missed my point. The fact is if you want to build new infrastructure it has to go *somewhere*. The problems with extending airports have been about people who have been forced to move due to their land being needed to build on. This problem would also exist if you wanted to build more rail systems (for example).

&gt;There is such a thing as light rail, but my guess would be the same people that pay for roads to be built. The difference between a road and a tram system is about 40cm of steel.

I live on the edge of town. Some of the roads here could be pretty much described as dirt tracks. A car can tolerate such a surface &amp;mdash; a vehicle which runs on rails would be able to tolerate it less.

&gt;One prolonged oil crisis would be enough, but practically it certainly could compete.

Electric cars are a thing. In Scotland 31% of energy is generated by renewable sources and they have projected that by 2020 this will reach 100%.

&gt;Just think of all the subsidies that are afforded to the car: car parks, the suburbs, out of town shopping malls, motorway services, petrol stations, police, etc, etc.

What about the train stations, bus stops and other services that public transport needs?

&gt;The car is awfully inefficient, and I contest it is even convenient when the average urban speed is barely reaching 15mph at some times of the day.

Which is mainly due to safety reasons of driving fast when there are people walking about.

&gt;Cars are not convenient

I can walk out of my house and drive anywhere I want whenever I want. Could public transport ever match this?

&gt;they are expensive, hard to store, expensive to insure, expensive to maintain, expensive to park, difficult to learn, expensive to learn, and so on.

* Storage is a problem for people in densely populated areas only. This is where public transport does shine.
* Insurance is high because humans are shitty drivers.
* Maintainence is hard because of planned obsolescence, not an inherent problem of cars.
* Parking is hard because humans are shitty drivers.
* Parking in populated areas a problem where public transport is useful. Park and ride systems are awesome.
* Despite learning to drive not being hard for people who aren't morons, a driverless system would solve this problem.",0,1347314932,null,0,false,0,c66bgg6,t3_znlcc,t1_c66bgg6,t1_c66avzm,null,1429866772,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Food inflation is real, and it's been statistically and practically significant over the past few years, while benefits have been frozen or reduced.

&gt; If only we weren't living in isolation of one another and there weren't another mother/father/friend in the same situation...

Your mother is 200 miles away, and guess what? You're not a special snowflake. People don't live near relatives as often anymore, and when you're in poverty you don't get to choose your accommodation, which means you often live in houses, tower blocks and bedsits away from friends.

Your idiotic point was that fuel poverty didn't affect the poor as they can't afford cars. I pointed out fuel poverty for the poor directly impacts bus fares (outside of London), and you mention ""tommies"" as some kind of response.  I stand by my original assessment, you're a fool.

I was actually a bit relieved at seeing at how good these two episodes were compared to the last Christmas Special, which I considered to be one of the worst and most disappointing episodes I've seen.

I did think the Rory and Amy divorce was a bit forced, but learning the reason why helped assuage that for me, it wasn't just them falling out of love or fighting. It may have been a way to introduce a way for the Doctor to send her off with a ""parting gift"" later on in the season, by somehow restoring her.

I do think the Doctor just happening to pick up a big game hunter before going onto a ship that just happened to have big game on it was a bit of a coincidence, unless he had some sort of prior knowledge that we are unaware of yet. 

My biggest complaint about the portrayal of Daleks in this season is that they appear much more submissive and vulnerable, which dampens their viability as a future threat. This is made worse by having them even forget who the Doctor is. I wouldn't worry to much about the ""Predator"" nickname... they don't call him that anymore. :) 

One thing that I thought was odd was the way that Oswin's data wipe also effected Solomon's database. It doesn't seem likely that Solomon's buyers and the Daleks would be into sharing data.

I haven't had any major issues with the portrayal of Amy, I like seeing the ponds being independent and the trio working as a team rather than just doing as the Doctor says.

Businesses would gravitate towards transport end points. Also see bike and short walks. I say most should live where they work. 40 minute average commutes are ridiculous.

&gt; You completely missed my point. The fact is if you want to build new infrastructure it has to go somewhere. The problems with extending airports have been about people who have been forced to move due to their land being needed to build on. This problem would also exist if you wanted to build more rail systems (for example).

It's an irrelevant point because it applies to motorways, bypasses, car parks, etc. An airport isn't like a mass daily transport system and to make very hard comparisons is unfair, especially when the problems aren't unique to rail based public transport systems.

&gt; I live on the edge of town. Some of the roads here could be pretty much described as dirt tracks. A car can tolerate such a surface — a vehicle which runs on rails would be able to tolerate it less.

I'm not saying cars have no purpose, I'm saying as a candidate for mass transport it is a political decision with poor economics. It is also disempowering to the consumer, inflating running costs, and de-unionising the transport system. Also most people don't live in the middle of nowhere.

&gt; Electric cars are a thing.

Good luck with the lithium.

&gt; Which is mainly due to safety reasons of driving fast when there are people walking about.

Wrong. It is mainly due to congestion and traffic lights. No amount of electric cars are going to have significant effect. One needs to increase passenger density or reduce travel.

&gt; What about the train stations, bus stops and other services that public transport needs?

My point was not to prove that public transport has no affordances, but to highlight the many externalities that creates an illusion of efficiency for the car. This is superstition born out of years of marketing and deliberate crippling of public transport from WW2 onwards.

&gt; Cars are not convenient.

Cars are not a mass convenience. They are a mass contrivance and hinderance. You just think it convenient because you haven't known or can't imagine anything else. How many lost days occur because of break downs or taking a car for repair?

&gt; Insurance is high because humans are shitty drivers.

Please, I'm not being hostile to you, nor do I mean to be.   

When you say 'cardboard bread', it's still bread, and there's plenty to take instead of bread - although I've toasted my own share of *that* bread.

&gt;Food inflation is real

Yes, and I keep consistently saying it is.  I am not attacking neither that point or you.

&gt;Your mother is 200 miles away, and guess what? You're not a special snowflake. People don't live near relatives as often anymore, and when you're in poverty you don't get to choose your accommodation, which means you often live in houses, tower blocks and bedsits away from friends.

No but please accept that people are people, and people are in the same circumstances.  So saying if someone needs to get to a supermarket without a toddler in tow I'm just saying you do what you need to do.  There's a roof.  There's healthcare.  There's education.  There's food money.   The child's food money is given to the guardian.   Guardian go get food, and find out how to get to the shop.

&gt;Sigh, you brought up energy bills first. I've just been responding to your point.

I can assure you I didn''t.  If someone else in the direct thread did, or if you want to ration it into energy costs, I've only responded.  Please check.

&gt;Your idiotic point was that fuel poverty didn't affect the poor as they can't afford cars.

I didn't say that because I was using end term prices of food.  I had no need to.  I never even took transport into consideration because Child Support is a supplement to the already available adult supplement.

&gt; I stand by my original assessment, you're a fool. 

I'm going to let that pass because I know I've rankled you somehow and I didn't mean to.

&gt;I'll change my opinion when 30p ""tommies"" come wyith a free five quid bus pass. Until then I'll leave you to have the last word.

If you can't walk 5 miles out of disability and necessity, and back,  I'll be the first to argue disability benefit for you.  This isn't that argument however.  As it goes a child's disability allowance isn't for parental travel which the parent should be doing anyway.

First, it clearly is a member of the Order Hemiptera, the ""true"" bugs.

The next thing that looks to be the case is that it is a juvenile form, which lacks wings. These are called nymphs in this Order, as they pretty much resemble the adults, but lack wings.

Now, that is as far as I feel comfortable in my identification. Hemiptera is a big and complex order.  If I had to guess on a family, I'd throw out Reduviidae, the Assassin Bugs:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin_bug

Although the wiki doesn't show any like yours, many assassin bug nymphs are reddish and tiny. Here's an image search for ""assassin bug nymph"" that will illustrate my point:

I'm suggesting that the car still has a place but the dominant method of transportation should be something else. You should read my other comments.

&gt; I can car pool effectively because I can just request a journey immediately using my phone and the nearest available car will pick me up.

That isn't really car pooling. It would still be one person one car unless you want your journey times to be longer. You haven't thought this through well.

&gt; Higher occupancy means less traffic,

Except it doesn't if we have bespoke journeys, especially at peak time. There needs to be one unit of transport for peak usage. Rail based mass transport can be regulated on frequency and carriage tweaking.

&gt; fewer vehicles,

Probably not.

&gt; electric vehicles (centralised charging)

The benefit of rail and light rail is that it doesn't need charging. That means no bulky stores of electricity. It also doesn't waste driving time during recharge, or wasted energy as it travels to find a charge point.

&gt; therefore emissions free

Same advantage can be found in rail.

&gt; cheaper (because no drivers)

Cheaper than what? Rail can be cheaper. It also has fewer drivers. It also doesn't require the total surveillance networks and distributed charge points.

&gt; more productive (I can work in my car),

Trains and trams have this benefit also.

&gt; Google can predict traffic

Who pays for this? Rail seems to be the most easily to predict.

&gt; and use the road more effectively and safely, so fewer jams and accidents.

So can rail. However, at peak times you will still have a problem of saturation for a road.

&gt; If you can't see how driverless cars are superior and will totally revolutionise transport, then you simply haven't thought about it hard enough.

And you have changed the debate. You have described public transport based an the auto-mobile (see what I did there?). The contention was public transport versus private car. I think you are being very naive regarding the efficacy and costs: unit, running and the inevitable externalities. Most importantly for me I don't even trust my laptop to not get hacked. I've thought it through, as well as the politics of it all but you haven't even presented a coherent hypothetical logic yet. Nationalising and the ability to strike can a good thing.

Nutritionally it's not, not for a growing kid. It's salt and hydrogented fat, which essentially is veg oil in solid form if you don't know.

&gt;  So saying if someone needs to get to a supermarket without a toddler in tow I'm just saying you do what you need to do.

You are put in a tower block or bedsit because that's where the council put you as everywhere else is full. You don't know your neighbours, and you certainly don't ask them (strangers) to take of your child while you pop to the shops. It's irresponsible unfortunately in this paranoid world.

Walk a 10 mile round trip with a toddler, carry a weeks shopping for half the journey,  let me know how you get on.


&gt; I can assure you I didn''t. If someone else in the direct thread did, or if you want to ration it into energy costs, I've only responded. Please check.

[Yes you did ""if they said they were having trouble paying electricity bills after they had cleaned their kids and fed them, a priority, then I'd have more arguments to defend them."".](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/zliex/our_children_go_hungry_for_want_of_tory/c6689po)

&gt; I didn't say that because I was using end term prices of food. I had no need to. I never even took transport into consideration because Child Support is a supplement to the already available adult supplement.

You started from the point that 15 quid is enough to live on, as you did it once when you were a student. But it isn't - a third of that goes on a single return bus fare anywhere outside London. So you don't use a bus, you use the local shop at higher prices.

That was my point - 15 quid is fine short term. Long term you have to take everything into account, and that includes how you get your cheap food home.


The adult supplement? Well that's going on rent - remember that housing benefit doesn't match actual rent anymore, and it's getting worse.

It's going on gas and electric, usually via pay point meters which charge more per unit than we ever would be prepared to pay.

It's going on clothes, it's going to Brighthouse at 200% APR for a washing machine because the cheap community loans you used to be able to get for white goods on benefits have been cut back.

Other essentials arguably include a landline and internet and a PC. Most services from council and DSS to bargain shopping all use the net, and libraries are closing [rapidly](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/sep/05/library-closures-ed-vaizey).

As my original post said, I don't think you will starve in the UK, but I do have some sympathy for people trying to support kids on benefits. It's gotten hard and will increasingly be more difficult.

A little more awareness of the situation, and a little less Panglossian fantasy about your student days wouldn't go amiss.

The tragedy of the world is, the richer you are, the cheaper everything is, both in terms of percentages of income, and the actual price you pay for things. The poor in the UK pay more for basics such as food and energy than we do, and that's worth remembering next time you buy your whiskey.",0,1347318869,null,0,1347319161,0,c66cdu7,t3_zliex,t1_c66cdu7,t1_c66bxmm,null,1429867217,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This would automatically reduce the number of required vehicles. It would also reduce it by means of freeing up cars which are currently wasted by being parked.

Mass transit can't even compete with cars today, despite subsidies and despite car usage being taxed at a rate which self funds several times over. What makes you think that trains will become any more efficient than they are now.

Driverless cars will be cheaper than existing cars due to better economies of scale and more efficient use of resources.

In reality the only valid objections are

1. cost effectiveness, but you haven't said how the alternative will be cheaper, and it needs to be much cheaper than it is now.
2.  time wasted in traffic, which will be less with driverless cars than with mass transit, as well.as lower volumes.
3. safety. driverless cars will be safer than driven cars. They might not br safer than mass transit, but people already.accept the risk from driven cars so this is not an issue.
4. emissions. Emissions might be higher than mass transit, but will be lower than for cars. In any case it will ultimately be electric for all forms of transport anyway by necessity. You can choose your pick of zero carbon generation. Also we will need significant load balancing for intermittent generation anyway, and car batteries connected via smart grid are a way of achieving this.

Think of it as the doctors timeline.

Lets say he dies for good in his 11th regeneration.

everyone in his personal timeline have still been defeated, no changing that.

But We will use the Daleks from this new season for example.

If the doctor had died in the previous season, he would not have been captured and sent to the Daleks Asylum right? He would not encounter those Daleks and any Scheme they took to destroy everyone would go unopposed because there is no new doctor.

the old doctor's never encountered these specific Daleks before, so the old doctors could not stop them, because he never meets them.

so Now lets take these new Daleks and put them one year after the 9th doctor defeats  the one's you are talking about. 

These NEW Daleks go to the year 200,101. There is no doctor there. 1-10 never go to the year 200,101. So he can't oppose these NEW Daleks.

Now if 11 were alive in this instance. 11 COULD go to the year 200,101 and stop them. BUT if he were dead, this would be impossible.

Get it?

By what criterion? It wins on terms of cost, convenience and transit time. 

&gt; You should note that the automated car doesn't exist yet, so that is billions and billions that would need to be spent on ""new infrastructure"".

The additional amount of infrastructure for Google cars is zero. No changes are required to infrastructure, only the purchase of cars which happens anyway. The only difference is that Google will buy them and we will hire them like taxis, and there will be fewer of them. So net change in infrastructure could even be said to be negative.

&gt; The running cost of mass public transport is far less.

Citation needed. I put it to you that public transport is far more expensive than current road expenditure, let alone driverless car expenditure.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; then car pooling can be allocated on thr fly without requirng any user to plan for it

I got your point. That's why I said you cannot have both those things; the shortest of journeys and the fullest of cars.

&gt; Mass transit can't even compete with cars today, despite subsidies and despite car usage being taxed at a rate which self funds several times over. What makes you think that trains will become any more efficient than they are now.

Mass transit has no where near the subsidies that the car has. Stop thinking in terms of government versus private, and look at the total expenditure. Roads, road markings, lights, (expensive) cheap oil (wars), the consumer buys the god damn car, pays for his own training, etc!

&gt; What makes you think that trains will become any more efficient than they are now.

Because friction, number of persons per vessel. Trains were deliberately crippled after WW2, stations closed. This wasn't because they didn't have the will of the people, nor that it was inefficient but because industrialists wanted to denationalise the transport systems while increasing profits.

&gt; cost effectiveness, but you haven't said how the alternative will be cheaper, and it needs to be much cheaper than it is now.

Neither have you said why auto-mobiles would be cheaper than rail. Cheaper is the wrong word anyway, you should be thinking in terms of energy in and useful energy out, along with any social or political ramifications.

&gt; time wasted in traffic, which will be less with driverless cars than with mass transit, as well.as lower volumes.

This is again a baseless assertion, one which I'm going to call a false predicate. Why should mass transit where you can have multiple decker vessels be beaten by small carriages that seat 2 to 4 people? Traveller density is always going to be lower for car-like vessels. You are going to say how auto-mobiles can be peered like snakes and driven in concert. Great. But it still gets no where near the density of a tram-like conveyance - call it PPSI (person per square inch).

You've internalised speculation and myth as truths. You are discounting PMT because of indoctrination.

The other thing to say is that you've still got lumps of metal whizzing round interacting with pedestrians and cyclists. You still need a world of tarmac, and I don't feel people will be happy wearing Google shoes or pedals.

You've not really addressed the possibility for mischief. Such a system you describe requires mass wifi (which I think we should have anyway backed up by fibre trunk ""roads""), and that means every car has to be following the same protocol, which means a totalitarian state of affairs, which means a nightmare regarding software and hardware. It also means one spiteful soul can easily mess things up by introducing plain old interference, but even without a general over-saturation of network channels is possible if you have tens of cars occupying the same location along with mobile phones and other internet devices.

You need to rule in PMT as a viable option because there isn't much to know either way. We can both agree that the car as we know it shouldn't be allowed to exist, but it is suffered because industry gets a mobile workforce that pays for its own transportation. That's the same reason why the current power centres won't let you have PPT (public private transport) based on the car. They want private transport reducing communities to individuals.

The other thing to think about is the socio-political ramifications. In a totally surveilled, totally automatic system with facial recognition, the ability to deny access to certain people for certain areas is a total possibility.

He couldn't just let Solomon go, not after all that had happened. He shouldn't take him back to the original Silurians that sent the ark ship, otherwise it might interfere with the established timeline.

So that left just a few options if a fair trial were desired: 

* 1) Send him to the Silurians after they've re-awoken (I want to say around the year 3020-ish IIRC, after waiting another thousand years from ""The Hungry Earth). For evidence, they'd have The Doctor's testimony, plus he'd also deliver the ark's records (and possibly the ark itself, what else was he planning to do with it? Send it back 65 million years to face the extinction it was trying to avoid?). Since Solomon's genocide was committed against the Silurians, they'd probably be most eager to try him.

* 2) Send him to the Shadow Proclamation. Actually, I just thought of this while typing this comment, it might make the most sense. I wish I'd thought of it before. They are supposed to be an interstellar court of sorts.

Indeed we see this played out in most facets of news reporting that include personal statistics - approval ratings, or exit polls, for example are simply the combination of a few hundred pieces of anecdotal data.

Moreover, IMO you've got to be singularly ignorant to dismiss such data out of hand - ""I was exposed to HIV and didn't develop AIDS"", sure, great story. Except if true (and of course we now know of such cases) then this anecdote provides vital data on which to begin a study, a study which will probably proceed initially by gathering similar anecdotal data.

Now, it seems probable - coming back to the matter at hand - that the number of people on benefits that are living relatively well-off compared with the lifestyle of those who're working [poor] is small. But I can't be certain of this. Like the parent my [limited] experience has people on benefits being substantially better off financially than I am through working.

true,GappyHilmore,IT,italy,"Nothing against Oscar I can see him there in the future. I think Josh is a more complete midfielder for the double-pivot now given his familiarity to the English game. Oscar is better when he's attacking but he's so talented that once he bulks up and and works on the physical side of his game he can be amazing when played back. 

After watching him for Brazil he is magnificent when played behind the striker.(1 goal and 3 assists against China tonight) Him and Lucas Moura were interchanging on the left and in the middle while Hulk stayed wide right. If Chelsea play Mata, Hazard and Oscar I think they may not stay wide enough to stretch the defense because they are so young and all want to be the #10. They will need the discipline if they are to going to play together. That's why I think fitting him into the starting line-up right now will be difficult. I would like to see Sturridge/Moses get the RW spot for now until RDM finds the right mixture of players. 

As for Ramires he played great at CM tonight. He linked well with Luiz behind him and Oscar in-front of him creating offense. I would rather see a Ramires-Mikel partnership than Lampard-Mikel. But not completely phase out Frank; he's far to important.

Sorry for the rant I just like sharing my opinions; since I moved to the US it's been hard finding people to talk football with haha

I haven't seen enough of either player to really evaluate them for the CM role. Josh did look good in flashes but he really needs a long series of starts. Oscar hasn't fit into our starting eleven yet so no point in trying to judge him right now. But I absolutely agree that playing him alongside Mata and Hazard would leave us way too thin, we need the natural width on one side of the pitch.

Ramires has looked good at CM but keep in mind his CM role for Brazil is pretty different than the one he'd play for us. I think there's a fairly large difference between a 4-2-3-1 midfielder and a 4-3-3 midfielder.

2 big reasons:

* They absolutely *do not* want you to default entirely and for them to have to pursue you through the courts because that's incredibly expensive for them.

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"In my experience it's very case-by-case. For one, it's far more common than most people think to experience suicidal thoughts... In fact a great many people I work with have them on a very regular bases but this does not preclude the act itself. The off-the-cuff procedure I've always used when assessing suicide risk is as follows:

1. Ask if they are thinking of killing themselves.

2. Have they thought about it how they are going to do it?

3. Is there anything stopping them?

If you get to number three and it's a negative response, then it's blue flashing lights time.

Most people are really afraid to ask questions like this because a) no-one really likes talking about this stuff, b) you will be shitting yourself whilst asking (I've done this for over 10 years but it still occasionally freaks me out) and c) there's always this thought that asking these questions will make things worse. Actually, it won't and you'll find that most people are very frank when you ask them.

Anyway, back to the point: If you get people in contact with the emergency or mental health services after question number 3, you may well have stopped a tragedy. Sure, it won't be a nice process as the person in question may end up on a section, but still, that's a small price to pay in the scheme of things. 

However, the really dangerous scenarios are when people who you know are in the danger zone suddenly become very calm and quiet. This is really hard to pick up on but it usually points to them having crossed that mental Rubicon and are at peace with their decision. This tends to happen with men more and the really worrying thing is that men are much better at committing suicide than women. Women *attempt* suicide more frequently than men but men tend to choose more violent methods (hanging, jumping, shooting) so tend to actually *commit* suicide far more (for want of a better word) 'successfully'.

The reason I'm bringing this up is because these are the hardest ones to catch because the signs are hard to pick up and they will actively avoid intervention. So the moral of this story? Don't be afraid to talk about suicide if you are worried for someone. It will feel weird and uncomfortable but it may well stop someone getting into a position that they can't back down from.",0,1347351841,null,0,false,0,c66j2dt,t3_zntus,t1_c66j2dt,t1_c66cpeq,null,1429870424,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

2. If it's something you want to be doing. Then do it. Ignore anything else to the contrary. Everything has a niche somewhere, and eventually you will find it. 
3. Extend your talents as far as you can. Never stop learning and trying new things in your art form. If you stagnate, you lose out on what could be a masterpiece. 
4. Embrace the noise and errors. If you find that you can ""edit"" out what you see as errors, find a way to make them work with your piece. That static could be the epic lead-in to a fantastic back beat you never saw coming.

3. It creates division in society rather than cohesion, by pushing out dissenters. Clever social policy, by contrast, incorporates diverse viewpoints in pursuit of the common good.

4. It impoverishes society economically by taking away jobs from capable people (e.g. teachers) and pushing them into forms of work that might not fully use their talents - if they can find work at all.

5. It empowers the state to a level that allows it to intrude onto matters of personal conviction and conscience. Do we want to give the state this much power?

true,ZeldenGM,eng-yorkshire,Graduate amongst ducks,"As someone who has been hospitalized following serious suicide attempts twice, I don't tip my hat to any support lines. When you're in the mindset of actually killing yourself, reaching out to anyone is not possible.

The best way is to try and perceive suicide risk by any signs someone might be exhibiting. Note there are clear difference between a suicide attempt and para-suicide. Para-suicide is a cry for help which will involve an ineffective non-fatal way of 'attempting' suicide, such as small overdoses or attempting in a position where they will be easily discovered. Pre-cursors to this are often the person being noticeably withdrawn, visibly upset, slow in movements, etc

On the flipside, the more dangerous suicide attempts can be harder to look out for. Behaviors may include visiting friends/family they haven't seen in a while, tying up loose ends within their lives, writing a will, and conversely; seeming suddenly much 'happier' and more care-free. Someone who was previously clearly depressed in their physicality may appear more upbeat and outgoing in the few days before they attempt.

Hopefully this first-hand experience will prove useful to some of you, the best thing to do if you are concerned to keep close eyes on someone, and try and keep them in your company.

I don't see the problem here, you are free to hold your views as long as they don't get in the way of your job, the same as any other job. When you stop doing your job-for what ever reason- then you could face losing your job. If you don't like what your job commands you to do then you are free to leave and get another job, or leave the country if you don't like the laws or the society.

Look at America. Religious people want creationism ""taught"" in school science classes because they know it's a way to ensure the next generation will also be backwards christian nutjobs.

Furthermore, how could this possibly not become a disaster for us?  Either the footage is heavily edited by Liverpool management or Brendan Rodgers to make us seem great, in which case it's pointless propaganda.  Or the club is not allowed editorial control, in which case there is a great risk of exposing and exploding internal conflicts.

I'm sure we'll see arguments and situations where players are behaving like idiots.  I'm equally sure that those kind of things happen everywhere.  How is showing that off to the world positive for us?  How many new barbs and chants is this going to fuel opposition fans to create?

Obviously just a dream (that I've had ever since Harry used it last year), but tell me that lineup wouldn't finish some fucking chances.  Yeah, it's overly attacking, but we should be trying to score at least 5 goals against Reading.  I feel that with how far Walker and BAE have been pushing up, they crowd the areas where Bale and Lennon operate.   Switching to a single wide player on each side would provide more depth at each position. I don't think stamina would be an issue, as BAE and Walker play end-to-end all game long already. Also, teams wouldn't be able to double team Bale, because if they send both the RM and RB at Bale, either Sigurdsson or Defoe will be unmarked in the box.   Parker starts in Dembele's spot when healthy, moving Dembele into rotation with Sigurdsson at AMC.

&gt;""Being Liverpool""

&gt;The six-part series, due to be aired in the United States later this month, documents the arrival of manager Brendan Rodgers and sheds light on his methods. 

&gt;They include the manager talking about the importance of developing players as people as well as footballers.

&gt;The meditation class is a technique used by the Boston Red Sox, and Liverpool players were put through their paces by ‘exercise physiologist’ Molly Kim, who works for the baseball club, during the Anfield side's pre-season tour of the USA.

&gt;But the introduction of the class, which was a one-off, appears to bemuse the players, who can be seen struggling to keep straight faces and at times burst into laughter - apparently at the absurdity of what they are being asked to do.

&gt;Jamie Carragher, one of the club’s most senior players, appears frequently on the verge of laughter as he carries out the meditation exercises to the sound of calming music.

&gt;During one exercise called ‘the cat’ one unseen player sends the rest of the squad into hysterics by making a quiet ‘miaow’ noise.

&gt;In the documentary, Being Liverpool, Rodgers also talks about his footballing philosophy, telling the cameras he does not believe in “training” players, rather he hopes he is “educating” them.

&gt;""You train dogs,” he says.

&gt;“Every player I see as my own son,” he said. “I want to do the very best for them. I want to be able to push them in their lives so they can do it for their children. We do everything in life for our kids. I don’t want to ever miss the chance of letting players understand that this is why we do it.”

&gt;The documentary, filmed by Fox Sports, includes a remarkable level of behind the scenes access. In one scene, filmed inside Rodgers’ home, it can be seen that the manager has on the wall a prominent painting of himself, which was a gift from a charity he had helped in Swansea.

The part about Rodgers having a painting of himself in his house is practically a chant already. However, I think this can help Liverpool economically, especially in the US market, which is obviously good for the financial side of things. And my personal interest overshadows any negative aspect of it, really - I'm really interested to have a peek inside of a football club like that.",0,1347371590,null,0,false,0,c66l7kw,t3_zpbh0,t1_c66l7kw,t1_c66l3yq,null,1429871435,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

true,daveduckman,null,null,"Henderson was put forward in a player plus funds swap deal for Clint Demspey, the day before the Hearts 2nd leg. Fulham agreed terms and Henderson rejected a move to Fulham outright. He was probably our best on field before being subbed off when he played against Hearts the next day. 

I admire Henderson's determination to stay put. At the same time, no event of the past couple of months has made me doubt FSG's 'plan' or Rodger's judgement as much as their desire to sell Henderson on, one year after a big big money move, some promising performances and an England call up. 

Having seen him play a dozen times at Anfield now, I'm incredibly confident that he will be a star. He's one of those players that is just much more impressive in person than on TV. He is built like an athelete, he has the workrate of a Liverpool midfielder, and he is incredibly neat on the ball - good first touch, good movement, good passing. What most struck me about Henderson, is that he looked really intelligent playing without the ball - he'd make good interceptions in midfield, and he'd get himself into good positions for the man on the ball to find him.

I sincerely hope that that was the last time Henderson's place would be placed under question. I would love to see Henderson prove his worth to the manager and prove his attacking nous this season, maybe providing us some more wide options for our threadbare attack or even pushing Gerrard for his place in the CM.

We play 5 games in 14-odd days after the international break. Henderson can no doubt expect to be playing several games in this period. I'm eager to see what he can offer when Rodgers is compelled to give him a chance.

I made a 9 inch high model out of balsa and bass wood.  I just copied some drawings and some pictures off reddit.  Didn't make this one, but I cloned mine from his pics and drawings, I'd follow one of the above plans or find another schematic, cause winging it was painful to say the least.  
http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/q7r9j/my_new_stash_box_is_bigger_on_the_inside/

Use a saw, or your lines will be crazy uneven.  I handcut everything, thank God for good glue.  I'll upload pics when I get me girl to help finish the signage.  I wanted to give her a chance to have a part in the madness.  A million coats of paint later and it don't look half bad, I'll admit.  A bit worn for wear like the real Tardis.  I'll admit, his looks nicer, but mine looks like it's been thru a Time-War.  :)  I'll update with pics of my own soon.  :)

I think if Chelsea were to go back to a 4-3-3(don't see it happening) obviously Torres would be ineffective and Mata would leave Cole exposed at the back like so many times  last season.  

Chelsea really just need to find a rhythm with  a certain group I players and stick with it so they can control possession  and get a familiarity with each other.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"&gt;1) Is this normal? Do these people genuinely need help or is it some sort of scam? I feel like a country girl, lost, in a big city but I'm not a complete simpleton I hope!

The bigger the city, the bigger the number of people without a guaranteed roof over their head. You can expect this situation to get progressively worse over the coming years, as the Coalition of the Inept continue to inflict their idea of ""Progressive policies"" on those most vulnerable in our society.

&gt;2) I've always heard that its best not to give them money but how else can they be helped?

Most big cities have homeless teams who go round and will do their best to help people sleeping rough - I've been with them on a few outings in the past, and they're worth their weight in gold. Generally speaking there is help out there for people who're sleeping rough - the problem is that there isn't *enough* help. Again you can blame feckless idiots who dictate the amount of money these organisations have in their budget.

As for your personal interaction with them? Remember at the end of the day they're still individuals, with their own story and background. Most won't take offence to you ignoring them, through a combination of staggeringly low self-worth, and the fact hundreds of people do it on a daily basis. My advice would be a simple ""*Sorry, I haven't got any change*"" and leave it at that.

&gt;3) Should I be worried? As a girl I often feel unsafe but I'm not sure if they are usually fairly harmless or not.

No. Homeless people are at far, far higher risk of being attacked themselves, than you are of being attacked by one of them.

If it's any reassurance - you're usually ""caught"" on CCTV upto 70 times a day in a major metropolitan area, so there's that.

Secondly, those who are unfortunately homeless are usually too caught up in their own issues to bother anyone else.",0,1347379386,null,0,false,0,c66n4ni,t3_zoa87,t1_c66n4ni,t3_zoa87,null,1429872405,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Menelgor,null,null,"Bulgarian here - the gypsies are a real problem in here and in Romania, and ruin the fun for all. It seems that they manage to do so in the Uk too. The problem is that their culture is totally incompatible with the ideas of integration and stuff... In my country the vast majority of gypsies makes their living from crime, drugs and social helps for having children like there is no tomorrow. Nearly all projects dedicated to integrating them into society, to educating them usually fail - even when not met with outright hostility by their community. . Even the mormons and evangelical missionaries have given up. 
Yes, there are people that are honest, there are those who get education, or get jobs, but they are a minority, and usually are shunned by their own. Another problem, as far as I'm aware, is that the EU is not very familiar with their cultural characterstics and does not understand that the standard model in the case is not only not working, but being exploited ruthlessly. And often there's nothing that can be done, because the gypsies can be very vocal and they are very able at exploiting the gullible. 
Now this is mostly a sociological and cultural problem, that unfortunately, would take many generations to be settled. 
The bigger problem is that the gypsies also ruin the fun for ethnic Bulgarians(and Romanians I think) - ever since we were accepted in the EU, the massive waves of gypsies have basically ruined the (not so good) image of the country, and have made it difficult for someone to find a proper job outside of the country. For example, we and Romania are the only EU countries that still need work permits and visas for the UK, because of them. Bulgarians and Romanians are viewed as suspicious in Netherlands, France, Germany, The UK and others mostly because on the passports of many of the picpocketeers, drug smugglers and others have a BG or RO in their passports. 

**tl;dr:**
These gypsies are probably there only for the benefits and have no intention of integrating in the society and it sucks that the British authorities have fallen for their tricks.  ",0,1347380098,null,0,false,0,c66nbhi,t3_zpau9,t1_c66nbhi,t3_zpau9,null,1429872496,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

What you see on Mucklow Hill now though are aggressive drivers.   Most people are going straight on when they eventually get to the island on there way to the City Centre, and they need to be in the left lane for that.  I need to go right at the island so I use the left lane, as I always have.  The problem is that when it comes time to move over for the single lane section, a lot of the drivers take umbrage because they think everyone in that lane is jumping the queue.  They are probably right in some cases, but people in the right lane in front of me do tend to be turning right at the island.  They then proceed to either block the entire lane by driving up the middle, or get so close to the car in front you cant merge.  

It just seems madness.  Before this mess there was hardly any queuing.  There were queues for sure, but they were very short relative to what we get now.  These days we get queues in both lanes and on some days it can stretch right down to the bottom of the hill (the large island, not the small one half way up).  Where is the sense?  It seems like they've penalized everyone that uses that road in the morning to assist the very few drivers that want to turn right into the trading estate (although I'm betting that whoever asked for this is regretting it now).

It's the exact same with the NHS. They don't check that patients are UK residents because the systems to do this would cost considerably more than the losses. The impact of them would only slowdown legitimate users of the system. It's a no-brainer decision until such a point that fraud is unmaintainable.

No one is saying that. However, the focus on it should be proportional to the scale of the problem, not the scale of the tabloid press coverage.

If every village has an idiot no village elects their idiot to represent it in parliament.   With PR the idiots get a representative - but they're still a village idiot and the average reading age passing legislation drops.  Nobody is better off, not even the idiots.

With AV it becomes 'anything but' voting and a polarising party, like the Conservatives, a party that sometimes shows that it is willing to make the tough, unpopular decisions, becomes distinctly less electable even though they might be the most popular.

The economy was linked to a rising oil price that didnt fall between 1971 and the mid 1980s, it was a 14 year recession in the west. Just as the world is linked economically now, it was also back then. But this isnt what she told the nation, she convinced them that it was Labour's fault that lines were growing at dole offices and the unions were holding us back and what was needed were flexible employment policies and to do that she had to smash the unions. That is what she did. The same attacks on the workers werent happening across Europe, they went through the same economic downturn, they saw the same growth patterns in the 1980s.  

She played a mindtrick on the British people and unfortunately it was swallowed because the media didnt tell the truth that other countries in Europe were suffering the same problems and the same growth. They backed Thatcher to the hilt. They supported her shortsighted sell-off of utilities companies, the grand sale of public housing, the clamp down on union rights.

She set out to destroy those elements of British society that she saw as a threat to her view of British people as individuals, corporations in their own right. In doing so she changed British society, we became selfish and competitive. We lost what moulded us together. There is no such thing as society she said.

&gt;“I don’t think people should be allowed to marry inside my religion, because that’s what my holy book says”

People aren't saying that though, they're saying people shouldn't be able to marry full stop. It is *entirely* analogous to discussions about interracial marriage in the 50s in the US. They believed their holy book had authority to dictate the lives of others too.

&gt;Marriage has no effect on life

Well that's completely untrue, it's also irrelevant. Same-sex couples wish to be married, there's no rational reason to prevent them from being so. As others have said, I don't think there are many that feel we should force churches to marry couples they don't approve of, just that marriage in general should be available to same sex couples.

&gt;If it was up to me religious marriage wouldn’t be recognised by the state at all.

Well that's fine, and that's an internally consistent viewpoint at least. Nevertheless, marriage **is** recognised by the state and as such should be available to same sex couples as well. 

It has been demonstrated that marriage does not belong to Christianity. That the UK was traditionally a Christian country is not relevant as we're predominantly secular now. If Christians want to exclude same sex couples from marrying in their institution that's fine, but so long as a straight, atheist couple can get ***married*** in a registry office, a same sex couple should be able to also.",0,1347388455,null,0,false,0,c66pk31,t3_zps67,t1_c66pk31,t1_c66peip,null,1429873551,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Although it is certainly apparent that there do need to be spending cuts, the risk is that too much austerity will seriously damage growth. I think the main problem is that no party or people have yet discovered the most efficient balance between spending to stimulate growth, and cutting to eliminate the deficit.

The risk of a general strike is that it could considerably reduce the publics perception of the Unions, and thus harm their position more than enhancing it. However the Unions must be realise that cuts are essential if the UK is going to reduce its debt, which sadly affects everyone.

And yet I've seen your comments, so clearly it hasn't been censored. downvotes put your post lower down or get marked as below threshold - people can choose to view them if they wish. If they don't want to see controversial opinions then that's their prerogative. 

&gt;They are saying that. Other than a few retard’s, I’ve not seen anyone openly say they hate gay people and that’s why their opposed to gay marriage.

That's not what I said, nor is it what I implied. People against same-sex marriage for religious reasons are not, by and large, suggesting that gay people shouldn't be allowed to marry in their religious institution as no one is suggesting that be enforced. Same sex couples want the right to marry just as straight couples have the right to marry. I'm a straight guy and if I decided I wanted to marry a woman in a particular church I couldn't do anything if they decided not to perform the marriage. No one is arguing for forced religious marriage. I have the right to *marry* a woman despite the fact that I'm atheist, if and when I get married it will not be a religious marriage and yet I'm still allowed. Gay people should have the same right.

&gt;Again, it’s not up to me to dictate what Christian people think, I’m not saying they are correct or incorrect, just that they have the right to express an opinion without everyone just throwing around petty insults, have an adult discussion or keep out of it.

They absolutely have the right to expose their views, however they don't have the right to have their views aired without criticism. Accusing them of bigotry is one aspect of that and it's not a petty insult, it's an entirely justified attack on their position. Just because they find it offensive does not make it an invalid point. I've no doubt that going back, people against interracial marriage, people against women's suffrage would have also felt insulted to be called a bigot. 

Additionally, I've yet to see an argument as to *why* being against gay marriage isn't bigotry? The only counter to this I've seen is that it's their religious belief and we should respect religious beliefs. Well I'm sorry but why is that adequate justification? If someone's religion claims that black people are an inferior people (as Mormons used to believe, as far as I'm aware) does that suddenly make it not a bigoted position?",0,1347391192,null,0,false,0,c66qbhl,t3_zps67,t1_c66qbhl,t1_c66pw7g,null,1429873913,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I wasn't particularly sympathetic to the miners growing up, I'm from an unremarkable, middle class family of Tory voters. Arthur Scargill was like someone from an alien land where people had tin baths, outside toilets and unfamiliar vowel sounds. 

I have a vivid memory of going to a really shitty part of the Midlands when I was a kid and there was desperation and litter everywhere, people panhandling, everything was grim and run down. My mother - hardcore Tory voter - told me that's because it was a Labour run council. 

Gradually, the way people learn that electricity is not magic - I learned the tricks that Thatcher and the Tories played on working people, people who work hard and pay taxes. Taxation being a key factor, as well as selling off social housing, economic warfare against communities, destroying manufacturing etc. 

Somewhere like Digbeth wasn't shit because of Labour but because the people who lived there were poor, and the disinterest of the haves in anything other than individual enrichment at the expense of others, which is the defining feature of Thatcherism. Oh yes, family - well, claiming you're not quintessentially selfish because you have relatives (an alcoholic zombie husband, a playboy Walter Mitty son, a racist hanger-on moron daughter) doesn't cut it.

Even on something I would like to agree with Thatcher on, there is nothing for me to admire or even remain neutral. Major can take some credit for the progress of the Irish peace process, Thatcher can take none. In the midst of internment, assassinations (i.e. of republicans), the petty and counter productive sadism that is a defining trait of Thatcherites, the Tories were secretly, grudgingly in dialogue with the IRA while maintaining the stiff-cocked bluster of which Thatcher was so resoundingly fond. The missed opportunities, seemingly to satisfy one woman's insane fantasies of glory (how she must have delighted at the attack on the Sir Galahad, I bet the image of crowds at the Cenotaph flashed before her eyes when she heard) are heartbreaking.

House: ""Fear me. I have killed hundreds of Time Lords""

The Doctor: ""Fear me. I have killed all of them.""

In ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" the Seventh Doctor causes an artifact called The Hand of Omega to be used to cause a sun to go nova, destroying an entire Dalek home world and a solar system as well. Slightly genocidal action there . . . 

In addition, the Doctor does resort to personal violence. Here's a link to a YouTube compilation of the classic Doctors using such personal violence to achieve their ends, it's called ""The Doctor is gonna bust a cap in yo ass"":

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzmnPs64K74&amp;amp;amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player

I will concede that the Doctor doesn't use violence or kill people lightly. He does so as a last resort, and usually offers the parties a way out before he is forced to do so.

true,LyttonDays,null,null,"See, I appreciate that towns that were left with no local industry remain bitter but I look at the industry and it was already in a death spiral and taking the country with it.  There's 12 deep coal mines still open today.  So I look at one town that has a mine, and then I look at the other town where the mine was closed down and I ask the question - *What's the difference between their mine and this mine.*  Why did one mine manage to stay open when another had to close -and there is a difference.  

If it was viable it either stayed open or a private company would take it over.  The miners could even form a consortium and buy it themselves, and in some places that's exactly what they did, but if an entire village is dependent on one industry it's inevitable that sooner or later the finite resource is going to run out and mines which can't turn a profit are only going to be kept open by those that still are.  Now factor in that Britain was facing 3 day working weeks, routine power cuts, and a small band of union reps were holding the entire country to ransom, driving prices up, and the economy down by standing on the nation's energy hosepipe.  The inevitable day was just brought a little forward, one might even argue that it'd been pushed back for too longer.  The industry was on the wane.   People had central heating instead of coal fires, nuclear was on the scene and promised to provide electricity for ten thousand years, and gas was cleaner.  It wasn't the Conservatives that killed the mining town.  The people fell out of love with the one product they were selling.  They played their card and lost.  They'd pushed too hard in '74 and that couldn't happen again.  The town always knew it was going to happen, Thatcher was simply the messenger they like to shoot.

As for unravelling social fabric and 'I' and 'me' taking over, that's only one way to look through the window.  On the other side is to look at it as the government is getting out of your way and leaving people and business to its own devices.  If people became dog-eat-dog it wasn't because the government ordered them to, it's that they stepped back and that's what people did.  Interestingly enough though they did recognise that government had a role.  It had to provide a money system, and they brought inflation down.  It had to provide certain services and contrary to what people seem to think happened NHS spending went up every year.  [It was less than £40bn when they came into office with inflation, it was over £80bn when they left!](http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/47717000/gif/_47717500_nhs_spending2_466.gif)   UK spending as whole went [up](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/zpo1e/anger_at_thatcher_death_tshirts_on_sale_at_tuc/c66o3ld) too.

As for the poll tax.  Council tax.  We all pay it.  Successive governments have all kept it.  It's the same thing but with a different ribbon on it, and again that's central government getting out of the way if you look at it as empowering local government with their own revenue stream.

I'm very sad to not be going back this October. Still need to start my job search, i've basically had a 3 month holiday. Sigh. 

Oh man; it just hit me this moment that I'm not going back - so many memories, so many things i never got round to doing.

If I can offer you one piece of advice its this: a degree is a degree, but this is kind-of the start of your life so choose who you want to be as a man/woman, create memories by doing lots of different things and dont worry too much about your first years work - despite what everyone says/thinks it doesn't matter in the long term. Your 3rd and 4th year marks do, and your 1st/2nd year marks matter for internships only, but you can easily social engineer yourself a good one.

Churchill was like no other college in that it felt so free and social. the fields were huge so you could mess around and have fun, and everyone was so down-to-earth; few pretentious snobs which the other colleges can sometimes have. Its a big college and everyone lives there rather than being dotted around town, creating a huge social dynamic like no other college.

Look after Dongfang, Chicks, Bracewell for me. I used to DJ pav - keep the party going for me. 

If you meet any 3rd or 4th year engineers then ask them about ""166"", ""44"" and ""MikeD"".

Personally, I don't like him out on the wing, as his industriousness is less effective as compared to the center.  

Because he is better defensively than our attacking midfielders he may have to adapt to the double pivot with Mikel/Romeu.  But by doing this, you are probably limiting what may be his best attribute (his energy).  Basically what I am trying to say is, I have no idea where he should go but he has proven that he is versatile and is willing to play wherever needed (including defense).  This is the type of headache that I'm sure RDM loves to have.  A player who is good enough to be a starter and can fill many roles, but has no defined role.

true,roodammy44,cnty-expat,Norway,"&gt;Yep, and those private schools invariably produce better results than state schools.

I have friends who went to private school, and I know a teacher who worked at one. They start with the kids of rich people who quite clearly have an advantage to the deprived chav children. Another interesting point about the private schools, is that shortly before exams all the underachieving kids get thrown out for 'behavioural' reasons. Management at the schools is sometimes shambolic. I would trust a decent state school over a decent private school any day, it's just a shame they got rid of grammar schools.

&gt;No, things end up ""broken and late"" because governments keep changing the order.

Undoubtedly, that's part of it. But contractor overspend is so routine, it's practically expected these days. [I apologise for the source](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-206529/MoD-overspend-hits-3-billion.html) but there is an example.

I agree to an extent on social housing, although I am now a fan of the shared equity alternative.

When they sold social housing they sold to the poor and the poor made a killing.

There's a well known narrative but when you come to actually look at it you have to peel layer after layer before getting to the bedrock of the argument.

true,YummyMeatballs,uk,London,"&gt;what difference does it make whether the bit of paper says married or civil partnership?

The difference is that society is saying that gay partnerships are not equal to straight partnerships and that's simply not OK.

&gt;We might as well just make all none religious ‘marriages’ civil partnerships and leave it at that.

And were that to be the case, I'm sure everyone would be fine with it. Couple of problems - first, it's *not* the case and it's very unlikely that secular straight-marriage is ever going to be relegated to civil partnerships so it makes sense to bring gay marriage up to the same standard. Second, Christianity doesn't own or get to define marriage. They can define Christian marriage if they wish, they can exclude whoever they want from marrying in church, that doesn't mean they get to do the same outside of church. Marriage does not belong to Christianity.

&gt;It’s not really being a bigot though is it? There’s a genuine part of their religion that claims gay people shouldn’t be together, so defending that part of their religion is entirely justified.

Your point seems to imply that because it's a religiously held belief that it can't be bigoted. Why on earth is that the case. It *is* a genuine part of their religion and they can ""defend"" it to their heart's content, that doesn't mean it's not bigoted. It just means that their religion has aspects of it that are bigoted.

&gt;Just throwing around words like “bigot” isn’t giving a constructive opinion, it’s just belittling someone else and assuming your right.

I'm not throwing around the word bigot, I'm specifically choosing it because it applies in this situation. I'm also astounded at the audacity of this comment. The anti-same sex marriage position is belittling gay people and assuming *they're* right. I call that out as bigotry but that's not OK? How on earth do you reach the position that religious belief should be allowed to say whatever it likes, no matter how offensive and yet criticise it and that's not OK? That's insanity.

Religion deserves no special treatment and its ideas should not be sheltered from criticism just because its followers believe that their position is inspired by the divine.",0,1347396733,null,0,false,0,c66rw2u,t3_zps67,t1_c66rw2u,t1_c66qqr0,null,1429874651,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

At the mixer. Again, we see the humanity of Rose. The cinematography here is pretty key as well, giving me (as the viewer) a glimpse of her growing panic. The convo with blue girl is cute, as well. This episode says ""we're all people, with kindness and arrogance and evil and self-sacrifice just like the ones you know, we just are made of trees or very blue. Except for the machines, they are soulless."" 

This episode makes me think of spiders in my apartment. Uncomfortable, that.

Rose ripping Cassandra a new one (not that she has many, mind) about not even being able to call herself human is an interesting scene. It serves up Rose's mindset to the viewer, and it gives us a good starting point from which to watch her develop. Cassandra doesn't seem to question that Rose is fully human and thus (from her perspective) can't exist. Cassandra is such a shallow character.

Why is a civil partnership considered lower in your eyes then a marriage? Because it was assigned to gay people first? It seems incredibly homophobic in my eyes.

&gt;Your point seems to imply that because it's a religiously held belief that it can't be bigoted. Why on earth is that the case.

I’m in favour of all free speech. Bigot these days just seems to be the British left wing equivalent of ‘liberal’ to right wing Americans. Of course they should be criticized, you have every right to do so. 

&gt;I'm not throwing around the word bigot, I'm specifically choosing it because it applies in this situation. I'm also astounded at the audacity of this comment. The anti-same sex marriage position is belittling gay people and assuming they're right. I call that out as bigotry but that's not OK? How on earth do you reach the position that religious belief should be allowed to say whatever it likes, no matter how offensive and yet criticise it and that's not OK? That's insanity.

I agree that there are quite a few bigots on the against side, but just labelling every single person on the against side a bigot is beyond childish and only brings you down to the actual bigots level, assuming all religious people who are against gay marriage must be by default a bigot, is in fact pretty bigoted.

We on the left are our own worst enemies a lot of the time, just look at the amount of people commenting and hating on religious people, all of them being extremely bigoted, yet we don’t bother to challenge it because we view them as right wing. Yet will happily chuck the bigot label at anyone that disagrees with us, without even bothering to hear their opinion, completely hypocritical.

I read somewhere about the spectrum needing to be relinquished for something else, and something to do with Europe. I can't find where I read that, but it makes sense.

EDIT: http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/consultations/900-1800mhz-wireless-telegraphy/responses/Network_Rail.pdf

&gt; GSM-R must be operational across the south of Britain (below the Severn-Wash line) by the end of 2012 as Network Rail’s licence with Ofcom for Band 3 frequencies expires at this time (ie there will be no licence to use the existing legacy radio network, NRN). The entire rail network below this line will be operating on GSM-R (and interoperable European trains will be dependant on GSM-R too).

Doesn't appear to say why they're expiring though.

&gt; Yeah, the Cambrian line from Shrewsbury has had ERTMS fitted for a couple of years now. They managed to fit the GSM-R equipment cupboard in the trains without taking too many seats out, which is good. Thing is it's all essentially a beta test up here anyway.

You'd think technological progress would mean that GSM-R does not need an entire cupboard, but I'm not privy to what the rollout actually consists of. (especially if you rip out the old radio gear?)

&gt; I don't know what the criteria for actually switching over is - probably all trains fitted with equipment and staff trained on its use or something.

Would make sense. I'm guessing they're prioritising the routes and train companies that need to use it now. I'd assume it works quite a bit differently to what they use at the moment.

&gt; It would be nice if the mobile networks could work this quickly, I get crap reception on O2 in my workplace, literally half a mile out of town. Go into town and it's full 3G signal.

That just sounds like typical O2. They have poor 3G coverage anywhere that could be described as vaguely rural.

I'm incredibly interested in a proper discussion about these things, but I don't really feel qualified to offer an opening gambit. I personally love the BBC's output, and if Partridge was lost by political means and fear of reprimand, then I'm not entirely sure how the thick of it got commissioned!

Alan Partridge and Charlie Brooker's A touch of cloth were two massive hits SKY got and terrestrial BBC didn't and I'm sad about that, but I'm not particularly sure that they were denied for political rather than financial motives.

Then, what do I know, I'm not exactly privy to how the machinations of TV production operates.

I think the BBC, in it's televisual output, really does OK. I really like a lot of BBC4's stuff, but am not amiss to see something a little more wry or witty on that particular platform...That said, Only connect and 'Lilyhammer' that I'm currently viewing fill that gap.

I can only think it's for digital tv or mobile broadband. If it was something like radio comms for the Olympics the deadline would have been something like January this year.

&gt;You'd think technological progress would mean that GSM-R does not need an entire cupboard, but I'm not privy to what the rollout actually consists of. (especially if you rip out the old radio gear?)

I'm going on what I read in railway magazines, and travelling on the trains a few times. I think it was probably one luggage rack at the end of the carriage that got sacrificed.

&gt;Would make sense. I'm guessing they're prioritising the routes and train companies that need to use it now. I'd assume it works quite a bit differently to what they use at the moment.

Yeah, I read on a railway forum that there were a few glitches with the initial roll outs. Like most new tech in any industry I guess.

&gt;That just sounds like typical O2. They have poor 3G coverage anywhere that could be described as vaguely rural. It's just as bad here for them (and Vodafone). 3/T-Mobile/Orange do a much better job, I've been in the middle of nowhere and still have 3G.

true,YummyMeatballs,uk,London,"&gt;Why is a civil partnership considered lower in your eyes then a marriage? Because it was assigned to gay people first? It seems incredibly homophobic in my eyes.

You're reaching there. Currently straight people can get a civil-union or get married. If we were to remove one option, then they would no longer have that option. That's what I meant by relegated, nothing more.

&gt;I agree that there are quite a few bigots on the against side, but just labelling every single person on the against side a bigot is beyond childish and only brings you down to the actual bigots level, assuming all religious people who are against gay marriage must be by default a bigot, is in fact pretty bigoted.

No, it's not and here's why: I'm not calling everyone who is against gay marriage a bigot without getting to know their position. I'm calling them a bigot because ALL YOU NEED TO QUALIFY is to be against gay marriage. Just as those who feel interracial marriage is wrong - that makes you a bigot. I'm sorry if they feel that their opinion is more valid than that but if you hold a bigoted position on something, you're a bigot. You're trying to use wordplay to make that not the case, it's nonsense.

&gt;Yet will happily chuck the bigot label at anyone that disagrees with us, without even bothering to hear their opinion, completely hypocritical.

I can't speak for everyone that uses the word 'bigot' so I don't know how much others chuck it around and their reasoning. I'll speak from my own position alone - I'm not calling someone a bigot because they disagree with my position, I call someone a bigot when they hold bigoted views. I tend to disagree with bigoted views so it coincides that the people I call bigots I disagree with. You're attempting to dismiss valid criticism by assuming that I use that word simply because I disagree with someone.",0,1347399786,null,0,false,0,c66sorg,t3_zps67,t1_c66sorg,t1_c66sdwo,null,1429875025,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

&gt;One whole generation of poor won the lottery

And sold out their co-workers, their neighbours and several generations to come in the process. They never stopped being poor, or inferior in the eyes of Conservatives - they became more accountable to the government. They were assimilated. Some people did point this out in the 80s, but faced with the bribe of a lifetime and the alternative being the infinite cruelty of Thatcher's contempt for the poor, was there a genuine choice?

Cherie Blair is one of the most brilliant QCs of her generation, a far more able legal mind than her husband. Perhaps I was harsh on Dennis, although his war record isn't anything more than you'd expect from someone with his privileges. He ran a paint firm that he inherited, again with a less than amazing record, and was on the board at Halfords for a while. He did oppose Maggie on her slavering zeal for the death penalty - so he deserves some credit.

I bought [a copy of this book from Amazon a couple of years ago](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Where-Theres-Greed-Margaret-Thatcher/dp/1851582339), I'm not sure where it is at the moment but it's an interesting read, even if its author failed to rectify most of the reckless damage she caused. The whole concept of her being the architect of prosperity, the rescuer of the economy, is a lie dwarfed only by the ignorance of how much the facts are in opposition to the perception. I think Ivashkin (mod on /r/ukpolitics) has read it too. 

Sometimes it's just memory, as that survives in things like [Paul Graham's photography](http://www.paulgrahamarchive.com/beyondcaring.html), writing, speeches like Kinnock's ""don't get old"" speech:

&gt;I warn you that you must not expect work - when many cannot spend, more will not be able to earn. When they don't earn, they don't spend. When they don't spend, work dies.

&gt;I warn you not to go into the streets alone after dark or into the streets in large crowds of protest in the light.

&gt;I warn you that you will be quiet - when the curfew of fear and the gibbet of unemployment make you obedient.

Third season, Nicola Murray (Labour) replaces Hugh Abbot as Secretary of State in a cabinet reshuffle (department is also renamed to ""DoSAC"" - the Department for Social Affairs and Citizenship). Ollie and Glenn stay on as her aides. The third season ends with the election being called by the Labour PM (based on Gordon Brown).

Fourth Season, Labour have lost the election and are now in opposition.

It takes power from the electorate to hold individual politicians accountable and empowers the old boy network.

It completely attacks an independent's ability to run and sends power to a more aloof government instead of local constituencies.  Gone is the representation of having a local MP.

As it stands it's more about the candidate with FPTP.  Put your name down, get more votes than everybody else and win a seat.  Most constituencies have around 60-70,000 people and turnout is generally around the two thirds mark.  There'll be several people running but most of the votes will be split between two major runners and then a smaller third.  You've essentially got 5 years to convince 20,000 people that you're the person for the job - just like Caroline Lucas and George Galloway did.  That's the protection we have to make sure politicians are capable, it's a bit of a shitty protection but it's better than nothing, put PR in place and it's gone and a hundred village idiots in a hundred villages suddenly get an idiot-chief to howl at the moon from the benches when parliament is in session.

&gt;So our party will be represented fairly rather than unfairly, do you have something against that?

How good are those roads? Our A-roads (no motorways in Cornwall) are mostly dual carriageway and partly not. Lots of bottlenecks.

&gt; Don't know what the line speeds are like for the train in comparison but Shrewsbury to Gobowen should be going up to 90mph soon. Whether the train can actually do that, being loco hauled, is another matter entirely.

Luxury! In Cornwall you struggle to do 70 (I guess the millions of viaducts and a very curvy track don't help), it's only when you go past Exeter going towards London that you break 100mph.",0,1347403350,null,0,false,0,c66tkhw,t3_znocv,t1_c66tkhw,t1_c66t4z8,null,1429875508,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

So those that are long term homeless are either not homeless and professional, chancers, addicts or choose to be homeless and don't want to be helped. The latter probably won't ask you for change.

Over 80,000 people in the UK are homeless from 2007 figures. Average numbers of rough sleepers - about 500, in the ENTIRETY of England. Half of those are London-based. 30% of the London based are Eastern European and can choose to go back at any time with help from the Government.

So that's why I don't generally give change to anybody. I'd rather buy a sandwich, or a phone card (I get the telephone one a lot, oddly).

Finally, a rant. Big Issue Sellers. The idea was to help support homeless people.

true,syntax,cnty-scotland,Stravaigin,"&gt; they have spent a fortune on a computer system,

Ah, now we enter the _really_ interesting territory.  The NHS _did not want_ the major IT flop, right back before the then Health Secretary forced it upon them.

So attributing blame for that is complicated.  However, even within that:

&gt; they have spent a fortune on consulting firms

The claim was not that they spend a lot; but that they are inefficent.  The NHS (collectively - it's not actually a monolithic organisation) would be the 5th largest employer in the world - that they spend a lot is not an indicator of inefficiency.

So you are accusing them of being inefficent, and have no numbers to back it up.  

You might be setting a target of 'perfect efficiency', and then arguing that they fail to meet that - but that can be applied to any organisation, so that's hardy a useful nor meaningful claim.

Looking in the aggregate (e.g. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10375877) the NHS delivers better results for less money than any other health provider in the world.
