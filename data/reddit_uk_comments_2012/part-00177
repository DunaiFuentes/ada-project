&gt;Tell that to the people of Boston, Lincs who have funding for services set at 2001 Census levels yet have seen a 12% increase in the number of migrants coming to the town since then. 

That's an issue of gov't funding allocation, brought on by immigration. That's not entirely the fault of immigration. It's bad management of immigration by the gov't. If the Boston economy saw an influx of immigrants, then revenue should be increasing. If the region is not seeing a return on that increased revenue, then that's just a piss take full stop. I'd like to see the figures before I made judgement, but if funding isn't being allocated to deal with an increased population, brought on by increased immigration, then clearly it's an issue in the region and I'd be an idiot to disagree.

The most famous application of the Panopticon design, is that of Prison Presidio Modelo, which whilst not perfect, achieved the central design goal - a series of prison cells, where prisoners were ruled over by one guard. The guard could monitor all the cells from one vantage point - the prisoners were unable to see if they were being watched or not.

Seems to me, if you want to ensure Welfare receipients are ""actively"" looking for work, particularly in the 21st century, there's not better way than making it mandatory for them to sign up to a website that will monitor their every digital movement and click, that will count how long they spent looking at each vacancy, how long the screen doesn't refresh etc.

true,HarryBlessKnapp,eng-GreaterLondon,South Weezey Mandem,"&gt;Any discussion about benefits is very difficult for a numerous of reasons. What counts as benefits?

Not to mention the biggest benefits expense for the treasury is benefits is people that are actually in work. So unemployment doesn't give the true reflection of strain as a result of benefits claims.

&gt;It really is not entirely accurate to say immigrants do not use services.

I didn't say that. I just said I don't think it's fair to say that they cause a greater strain on services than the economic boost they provide. It's a labyrinth of information. I honestly don't know how people draw conclusions on this. I mean have you got figures for all those ""anothers"" with demographic breakdown for each?

Again, for all those issues of you'd have to compare against the comparative issues presented by indigenous Britons to see if it really is a strain. I mean would policing costs be higher given that white brits are prone to binge drinking? Morally obviously one if more repugnant, but we're talking about strain on services.

The only recent stats I've seen suggest that migrants are less likely to claim benefits. You're saying that there are a number of reasons that this could be, relating to what is defined as benefits. I mean until I see stats supporting that claim, it would be very hard to judge and I'll probably make a conclusion based on the stats that I have seen.

The whole thing is a minefield. Have you got anything conclusive to say that immigrants do apply more of strain than the economic benefits they provide? Otherwise I'd be hesitant to make that claim. At the same time, what worries me is people presenting that claim as fact, especially in the tabloids, then this gets picked up by a lot of people, and builds resentment between communities, and that's not good for anyone. I think a lot of misinformation gets spread like this, and I think it really is damaging. That's my main concern, that the fear of immigration becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that will serve to create more tension.

To cut a long story short, humans have got an irrationally large fear of out groups, and if we don't keep it in check it really can cause problems that we don't need and don't want. And personally, given that the evidence is not conclusive, I'm concerned that a lot of people that are against immigration are failing victim to that irrational fear.",0,1355327572,null,0,1355328094,0,c7feyd2,t3_14nvgf,t1_c7feyd2,t1_c7feh1a,null,1430653394,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I originally felt we might need a new first-XI left back, but Enrique's in form again; long may it continue, but we'll get a better understanding of whether LB is an area that needs an upgrade at the end of the season, once we can get a feeling for exactly how consistent and reliable Enrique is over the course of a full season. 

As for backup defensive players, whoever we bring in has to be damn good to justify stalling the progress of younger players like Robinson, Wisdom, Kelly, and Coates (plus Flanagan, too).

This is an incident that was handled really poorly by the club, from beginning throughout. Not just the website article, but the way that was defended, and then the followup comments, etc.

It should never have gotten as far as a complaint being filed. While the tapping up rules are very strict, there is a non-enforcement agreement between most clubs. A bit like mutually-assured-descrution - where everybody has dirt on everybody else and you don't want to fire the first shot because it wouldn't only see everybody get rolled.

For Fulham to go as far as they did is an indication of how upset they really were. I think our management, particularly FSG, underestimated how important this is in English football and how other clubs perceive it. They likely didn't realize that a lot of these topics are handled one-on-one with gentlemans agreements between clubs rather than infront of EPL arbitration panels.

We never should have defended the website, BR shouldn't have said what he said and our team should have reached out and apologize within *hours* of the website mistake, not months later. 

Anyway, glad it is over - another learning experience for the new owners.

At Middlesbrough and Aston Villa, he was given every opportunity and every chance to succeed and work through rough patches, more of the offense was tailored to suit his style.

At Liverpool, he was frequently played out of position and - over time - he has received fewer chances to succeed here and there is increasing pressure to be good in a limited opportunity. So, there's all sorts of pressure on his shoulders that grows from week to week.

I must admit that I was excited when Downing was signed to the club, I thought he would be a great player. The talent seemed to be there, he's an England international, he could score some goals, provide some assists, maybe overpriced but surely he could prove his worth with solid play.

I have a hard time believing that Downing suddenly lost all of that talent that we saw before. I think it's a confidence issue and I think both LFC and Downing should amicably part ways and Downing can restart his career elsewhere rather than spending some of the prime years of his career on the bench.

What boggles my mind about the people fighting against this is that they are arguing that they since *might* in future be forced to marry gay couples when they don't want to (which seems silly looking at the actual plans) we *must* stop Churches who want to marry gay couples from being able to legally do so. A unlikely future threat to their freedom clearly is more important than the actual restriction of freedoms others are bound by *right now*.

I don't think it's obvious nor necessarily true. If you can show me recent stats for how this is the case, but going on the only recent stats I've seen I don't think I'll be changing my view. Not to mention, if wages are being topped up by the tax payer, that is partly the fault of business. We're subsidising businesses there, as much as we are subsidising the workers. Again, this is business causing additional strain, not simply immigration. Perhaps the gov't should stop these top ups.

Regardless of further legislation, the European Convention on Human Rights is clear, as is the practices of the ECHR and the UK has no power to change that. Nor does it have much power to prevent its change: if the ECHR becomes pro gay marriage to the extent of trampling on religious rights then the UK's law will be of no relevance on the issue.

To be clear again: no church has EVER been forced to violate its explicit doctrines regarding how it conducts its faith. This is not the thin end of the wedge. There is no wedge. The ECHR has never impacted on church freedom. It has not started a process that can be continued. We are in EXACTLY the same place we were in the 1950s regarding the likelihood of the ECHR to compell religions to act in this manner.

As I said elsewhere, they have never acted against bans on female clergy, despite DECADES of gender equality laws. Where is your wedge there?

On the flip side,allowing only civil gay marriage WOULD impinge on religious freedom, by not allowing pro gay marriage faiths to marry. Were the law to pass WITHOUT allowing these faiths to offer gay marriage that probably WOULD be struck down by the ECHR. It is THAT pro- religious freedom. 


The other issues aren't really relevant because they don't concern the argument about whether or not they are going to be forced to marry people against their will.

If they wish to make those as a point, then they have to make them as separate issues. The changing of  social normalcy, kids etc, has no bearing whatsoever on whether they are going to be forced legally to conduct certain marriages.

Those issues may be at play and be legitimate points, but they are issues distinct from the possibility of compulsion. Whether or not you feel your kid may be exposed to seeing gay people in a more positive light that you would like has literally no possible connection to the European Convention on Human Rights.",0,1355335049,null,0,1355335642,0,c7fh0a3,t3_14q2wo,t1_c7fh0a3,t1_c7fdyi6,null,1430654519,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

They can't. We went through this when the original incident happen. This is referred to as a 'Section K' violation, but it is now actually in Section T of the rules since the EPL have changed all the rules around.

Here are all the appropriate bits:

&gt; ## Section T

&gt; ### Approaches to Players

&gt; T.1. A Club shall be at liberty at any time to make an approach to a Player with a view to negotiating a contract with such a Player:

&gt; 1.1. if he is an Out of Contract Player; or

&gt; 1.2. in the case of a Contract Player, with the prior written consent of the Club (or club) to which he is contracted.

&gt; T.2. A Club shall be at liberty after the third Saturday in May in any year and before the 1st July next following to make such an approach to a Contract Player:

&gt; 2.1. who will become an Out of Contract Player on that 1st July; and T.2.2. who has received no offer from his Club under Rule V.17.1; or T.2.3. who has received but has declined such offer.

&gt; T.3. Any Club which by itself, by any of its Officials, by any of its Players, by its Agent, by any other Person on its behalf or by any other means whatsoever makes an approach either directly or indirectly to a Contract Player except as permitted by either Rule T.1.2 or Rule T.2 shall be in breach of these Rules and may be dealt with under the provisions of Section W of these Rules (Disciplinary).

&gt; T.4. For the purposes of Rules T.2 and T.3, “Contract Player” shall include a player who has entered into a written contract of employment with a Football League club.

&gt; ### Public Statements

&gt; T.8. **A statement made publicly by or on behalf of a Club expressing interest in acquiring the registration of a Contract Player or by a Contract Player expressing interest in transferring his registration to another Club (or club) shall in either case be treated as an indirect approach for the purposes of Rules T.3 and T.6.**

&gt; ## Appendix 6 - Code of Conduct for Managers

&gt; 6.2. A Manager shall not, either directly or indirectly **(including by making any statement to the media)**:

&gt; 6.2.1 make an approach to a Contract Player with a view to the Manager’s Club negotiating a contract
with such Player except as permitted by either Rule T.1 or Rule T.2; 

That is the rule Rodgers broke twice in his press conference after the website article mistake. 

Players are allowed to say things like ""I would love to play for Barcelona one day, it is a dream of mine"", but managers are not allowed to say ""we would be really interested in seeing Dempsey play for us"" without the written consent and approval from the club to begin negotiations with the player and even then only after a bid has been made. Approval is very rarely, almost never granted and it is simply a taboo topic amongst managers.

For the traditional managers like SAF and Wenger the worst thing a manager could do is talk about players. This was the big deal when Mourinho came to England and riled everyone up.

Manager comments are treated much more seriously than the actual tapping up by agents. There hasn't been a 'section K' complaint in the Premier League since the Ashely Cole case. That doesn't mean there hasn't been any tapping up, it just means that clubs have agreed to not pursuit each other over it since everybody does it. Manager comments, on the other hand, are seen as a much more serious infringement.

    to keep under review the situation in the United Kingdom with respect to drugs which are being or appear to them likely to be misused and of which the misuse is having or appears to them capable of having harmful effects sufficient to constitute a social problem, and to give to any one or more of the Ministers, where either Council consider it expedient to do so or they are consulted by the Minister or Ministers in question, advice on measures (whether or not involving alteration of the law) which in the opinion of the Council ought to be taken for preventing the misuse of such drugs or dealing with social problems connected with their misuse, and in particular on measures which in the opinion of the Council, ought to be taken

        a) for restricting the availability of such drugs or supervising the arrangements for their supply;
        b) for enabling persons affected by the misuse of such drugs to obtain proper advice, and for securing the provision of proper facilities and services for the treatment, rehabilitation and aftercare of such persons;
        c) for promoting co-operation between the various professional and community services which in the opinion of the Council have a part to play in dealing with social problems connected with the misuse of drugs;
        d) for educating the public (and in particular the young) in the dangers of misusing such drugs and for giving publicity to those dangers;
        e) for promoting research into, or otherwise obtaining information about, any matter which in the opinion of the Council is of relevance for the purpose of preventing the misuse of such drugs or dealing with any social problem connected with their misuse.

As far as evidence goes, its evidence is the only evidence that counts. Hence why when the chair Prof Nutt was forced out following his lecture on the relative harm of drugs (he pointed out, entirely correctly, that more people die per year from falling off horses than from taking ecstasy, and that in the ranking of danger of various drugs, alcohol and tobacco came in far higher than LSD, cannabis and ecstasy), seven members of the ACMD resigned, citing the pointlessness of continuing if their advice was ignored. 

If you ask the scientists who form the (unpaid) advisory body that is set up for the *sole purpose* of advising the govt on drugs, their use and the laws pertaining to this, to produce a complete analysis of the current situation, vis a vis usage and law, they deliver their recommendations and you then utterly ignore them and do what you want anyway, you look like a bunch of total knobs.",0,1355337627,null,0,false,0,c7fht3m,t3_14q1xp,t1_c7fht3m,t1_c7fglrr,null,1430654896,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Some welfare to work providers - some, not all - are already making claimants sign paperwork stating they'll actively look for work for thirty hours a week, it was certainly commonplace in a4e back a few years ago from what I've been told.

I originally come from a programming background. I haven't written a line of code for years at this point, but even to someone like me, far, far removed from a programming environment, I know it wouldn't be difficult to design a website that tracks *what* exactly you do when you login.

With that in mind, I'd imagine hitting the F5 key would be logged - along with all clicks on the site, amount of time spent looking at each environment etc. Hell a Kindle can, after about ten pages of reading, tell you not only how long it'll take to read the remainder of the chapter, but after about 20 - 30 pages it'll tell you how long it'll take to read the actual book.

May 7th 2015, unless the current Government collapses, or a vote of no confidence takes place.

&gt;This is fucking insane.

Speaking as a cold hearted cunt, Universal Jobmatch is a stroke of brilliance. It will allow them to wind down the number of JCP staff - and indeed buildings, monitor claimants in real time, issue and process sanctions significantly faster, and cut down on ""fraudulent activity""

But as I'm not a cold hearted cunt [at least, I like to think not] I'm inclined to agree. It's at the least a wee-bit ridiculous; at worst, a system put together by people who've never signed-on, yet alone dealt with long-term unemployment.

&gt;It take me no where near 35 hours to do a proper search and there is no way i'm wasting my time doing pointless job searches when I can condense the time and do more practical things like learn new skills.

Bear in mind I don't work for the JCP - the last time I went into one was to hand in paperwork for someone, after her paperwork had been ""lost"" four times, to ensure that it was actually processed. I also don't have a crystal ball that lets me see the inner machinations of our Government - the whole real time monitoring aspect is merely my personal feelings on what UJ and UC are being introduced for.

But I do completely agree with your point. The problem, however, is that a system whose very name starts with ""Universal"" isn't going to be tailored to individual needs - it's being rolled out as a ""one stop"" solution for every jobseekers / potential jobseeker in the country.

It's no different with welfare to work programmes - they're not, for the most part, designed with individuals, they're typically one approach fits all programmes. Almost any recruitment expert will tell you that 35 hours of unfocused job hunting is worse than 5 hours that are focused, but try telling that to the Government.",0,1355344228,null,0,false,0,c7fjwny,t3_14q1c4,t1_c7fjwny,t1_c7fjq2i,null,1430655886,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,intangible-tangerine,null,null,"British working class sitcoms have historically only worked well in the US when a black cast is used. One foot in the grave became the Cosby show, Steptoe and son became Sanford and son. White Americans are generally sold sitcoms on the basis of their being aspirational. The characters generally have good jobs, are good looking, live in nice houses etc... whereas black audiences are marketed sitcoms that emphasise social realism and just as the downtrodden working class hero struggling against an indifferent society is the centre of the British working class sitcom, the downtrodden black hero is the centre of the Black American sitcom. In America race=class at least in TV land. 

This held until the late 1980s. The two break through sitcoms which reversed this trend were the Fresh Prince of Bel Air and Married with Children. Married with Children should have taught the American networks that white America can accept portrayals of white people which aren't aspirational, but it didn't. *sigh*     ",0,1355346319,null,0,1355346659,0,c7fkkac,t3_14qd6y,t1_c7fkkac,t1_c7fg3vb,null,1430656194,1,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,1

28 goals in 72 apps for Internacional, 6 goals in 6 apps for Brazil U23 / Olympic squad (and Olympic Soccer Tournament top scorer) and 14 apps for Brazil with a couple of goals isn't that bad.

If you compare him to the other strikers we've been linked to I think he comes off quite favourably. Sturridge has never scored for the English senior team (with only 4 apps), and Wallcott has managed 34 goals in 181 senior apps.

Huntelaar is a different case - he's much older than those players and definitely comes under the 'proven' catagory, but I don't think he'll be able to keep up his current scoring rate for more than a couple of years.

You can have your favorite persona or companion, but the real thing we love is the world the Doctor gets to goto. We love the ideas,, the stories, the twists, we love that knowing look we can share with other Whovians we know. I am just as giddy for bumping into a random Whovian at a store or in the parking lot that can instantly know my feelings on the show than I would be meeting 10 or 11 or 3 or 4.
We can take solace in the fact that we have been exposed to bits of the culture from across the pond by simply watching a show about a man who may visit over there more often, but who in all of his incarnations talks about the goodness in us all. No matter what country you are in, the idea that humans are curious and wonderful creatures and a man from Gallifrey sees fit to pop in and make sure things are OK is something that anybody who can hum the tune or knows what a Sonic Screwdriver is can be very happy about.
Its fine that we don't get a chance to meet them over here.

I *believe* that orders are not accepted by BT Wholesale (the bit of BT that provides your internet connection) until you supply a MAC. So that's probably why the date slipped, as the order did not go through until you got a MAC. I am not with BT but my ISP was unable to proceed with the order until I got a MAC - *then* they gave me a date.

I ordered the equivalent of Infinity but with another ISP.

My ISP took my order, BT Wholesale accepted the order (we were unsure if the street cabinet was actually in service), on the scheduled day of installation at about 9am the engineer called and said everything would stop working while he repatched my line at the cabinet. At 9.15 he turned up, changed the master socket, plugged in the modem and it worked fine. 9.45 he left the house (there was a problem with the phone extension wiring; probably my fault, but since I'd already saved a lot of time by running network and power to where the modem needed to be he didn't mind fixing it)

I don't have a problem with BT. I wouldn't necessarily have them as my ISP but for the bits of the connection they do provide me they seem fine.

If it gets a second series I'm sure it will improve as the characters gel. This is a somewhat awkward first series with some misses, but the ingredients are there for greatness if the BBC sticks with it.  

Some of the criticisms I've seen on review sites are just laughable! 

Saying it's copied inbetweeners because it's set in a school, uh...St Trinian's anyone? Do these people really think comedy writers didn't think to use school settings until the inbetweeners? Really??? 

Saying they should have used younger actors to make it more realistic, yeah 'cus in the current climate the BBC is really gonna use 16 year olds in sex scenes... funny how this critique wasn't used against the inbetweeners.... 

Saying it's not 'edgy' enough - it's about a girl's football team in a London comprehensive school, not the Balkan wars. 

The only thing I really dislike about it is that the character of Viva's little brother has no depth. You could lose him without losing any of the funny and that would give more room to explore the dynamic between Viva and her dad. There are enough teenage boys in the story lines that you can fit in plenty of masturbation jokes without needing a special character for them.

true,EatYurSaladDave,,Belfast,"Hay, I don't go to UU but I go to the other main University in Belfast (Queens), so unfortunately I can't answer your 3rd question, sorry. I'm a final year student and I can tell you I love this place, I don't regret coming here at all. The student life is great, and really can cater for whatever you're into. If you like partying then there are plenty to places to go, no matter what music/scene you're into. E.g if you like alternative music, limelight will cater for you, if you like chart try the box or stiff kitten and there are plenty more.If you're not into that, this place has a wonderful history, the new titanic quarter I hear is a great place, and because the country is small, visiting the north coast is a must. Beautiful scenery and the giants causeway is are biggest tourist attraction (I think) and is def worth the trip. Although the recent news about this flag protest might give you a, 'stay the fuck away from here' opinion of N.I I can tell you these people are not everywhere, they can be easily avoided, and if you're in the student quarter you will almost never have to deal with them. I enjoy living here, most people are fantastic and always friendly, and I would really recommend you coming. As for travel, the international airport and the city airport provide very good routes to mainland UK and also most major cities in western Europe. If you want to know anything else, just ask.

We recently got a new ISP here, we got a fibre optic line all the way, even inside our house, right up to our new router, which they gave us. They also gave us a new phone to go with it, as they took out the phone line for the fibre cable. It's a pretty alright wireless phone, the router looks exactly like the BT ones, it is a Thomson one.

It cost us nothing for this, we rung up, and they installed it 3 days later. That is, we asked for it to be setup one afternoon, and at a similar time 3 days later (They gave us a time of I think between 2pm and 4pm) the guy came, stripped out the old cable, put the new one in, setup the router and phone - that he brought with him for us, and then he was gone, and it was working. He took about 60-90min to do all that, and on top of that, for the first 3 months, we get it half price. We get free calls to landlines 24/7 and free worldwide calls between 9pm-6am. The package we have is 30mb down and 3mb up, (we download files at 3.7megabytes per second) but we can upgrade to 100mb down 10mb up at any point with a phone call, but for an extra 10Euros, we didn't really see the need, it's 30Euros a month for all this, and as I say, it was half price for the first 3 months. With no additional fees.

And this is in Portugal. It makes BT look like a joke. Our previous ADSL provider kept having issues - most of it was with the copper cables, we got tired of every couple of months having to call them up to get someone to come and fix something, but again, it was 20mb ADSL, and we would get 17mb. The best I had in England was being less than a mile from the exchange, and getting 13mb down.

Correct. You are treated as a couple so his income is counted when calculating your entitlement to income based JSA

&gt;  This also meant that I was refused council tax benefit.

This isn't necessarily correct. You don't need to be getting JSA to get council tax benefit - it is based on your income.

Correct. Students have an exemption and you're not a student.

He purposefully announced the sale early, causing the price of gold to drop through the floor so it would be cheap for the US banks to buy.

One problem with having as many Doctors as possible is that you run the risk of the episode/story being a sheer clusterfuck. 

...actually, all of Steven Moffat's episodes are sheer clusterfucks, so maybe that's nothing new. 

But my original point was that, ideally, you'd still like for there to be a story amidst all the Doctors and references to characters and events from the classic series. Not an easy line to walk.

Let's face it, whatever happens, people are going to be disappointed with the 50th. Some will say that the classic Doctors weren't represented well enough. Some will say that there wasn't enough of their favorite Doctor. Some will say that the revival Doctors (or at least, you know who) got too much attention.

We're on a variable tracker, so we pay X amount over the base rate.

1. Student life seems to be pretty active and there's just about everything a person could want.   If you have specific questions, check to see if there is an email address for the Student Union and they'll guide you
1. You'll never be the same once you translate all the jokes you guys tell about New Zealanders and translate them into Northern Irish terms (in the town I went to high school in, we picked on a town called Rathfriland)  The N'orn Irish are generally some of the most friendly people you'll meet - we love outsiders, we just struggle to like each other (jk!)
1. got nuttin' on this.  I was a CivEng at Queen's, but I know the MechEng guys seemed to be much kinder to their UU counterparts than other degree programs.  If this has been arranged through your College/Uni you'll find that in the same way your program has strengths and weaknesses, so will any other school.
1. Travel is a cinch, but there are some things you'll need to do to make it easier/less expensive.  When you get your student ID, get a European Young People ID card - discounts on buses and trains.  Always ask for student discount and use the Student Union to look for cheap travel.  Easy Jet and Ryan Air are just 2 of the low budget airlines that have no frills, but will get you to the continent.  There are also some options like a euro-rail pass (used in conjunction with the euro-ID) that will get you discounted public travel in as many as 26 countries.  Best advice is to plan ahead, sleep in youth hostels, leave an outline of your travel with someone, and see the world.

On the installation date, engineer called and told me that he can't install it because there are faults on the line ( and yes there were) and he can't install it until its been fixed. 

They kept given me new appointments up until 14th of November, when finally it's been installed. 

I thought the ordeal was over, but I thought wrong... 

Last week for couple of days Openreach was doing some work at the cabinet we are connected to. While they were working we had intermittent Internet &amp; phone service and when they've completed their work, packed up gone, we lost both the Internet connection and the phone. No dial tone, no anything, not a peep.

They were suppose to fix 2 days ago. No engineer came, ringing customer service results only to reciting their same old script and ending it with a new date. 

Twitter team wasn't helpful either, they told me that they've contacted the engineering team and once they let them know what's happening they will call me within 2 hours.
No call came back not even a response through twitter nor email.

Society for being a bunch of lazy scroungers
Society for not providing enough opportunity.

Nobody is any more prepared than before the riots, in fact there are now fewer police officers than then thanks to the budget cuts.

There are no new tools to disperse rioters, no decisive decisions made on ways of tackling them. 
No agreements drawn up with the military either to compensate for all of the lost police officers as a result of the governmental dry-fisting their budgets have received.

Society is still equally disillusioned and fed up of ""the system"" and it's entirely plausible that it could happen again.

I hope you mean that in a general sense given that Britain has spend most of her history under a deficit. For instance, we've only had 6 years of a surplus from 1979 onwards (1988-1989 and 1998-2001), though I'm a Keynesian at heart so it's always irritated me that we never bother to do it.

true,lapin7,null,null,"I used to feel that, for Liverpool FC, all judgements should be deferred to the Hillsborough families on this matter but actually, that's not necessary and it's a bit degrading towards the whole HJC. We don't follow the justice campaign and argue passionately for it out of deference or any kind of blind loyalty, not even simply to support and empathise with the families and Liverpool supporters directly affected, but because it's right. What the HJC does is so right, so on the side of truth and justice, that I can't even imagine being in the position of awareness that I am in and not caring about it so much.

The only thing Margaret Aspinall has said here which I could even slightly agree with is the suggestion that the safe standing campaign might detract attention away from the HJC, or even worse, reduce the empathy towards the horror of 1989 by disassociating the Taylor Report with the present day. I even think this is unlikely - it's speculation either way, and I certainly think that both campaigns (of course very, very different in their importance and tone) can coexist. They aren't/shouldn't be seen as rivals or competitors for attention or anything like that - whether or not that happens is another matter but again, I find it unlikely.

&gt;She added: ""There were 96 dead at Hillsborough and it could have been a lot more. Standing should never, ever come back. I do not think there is anything safe about standing. I feel insulted that while people are trying to fight for justice for Hillsborough, that this campaign is growing now.""

I do feel bad for saying this, but she's a public figure now and has influence on LFC so I have to say she's so so wrong. 

She says she doesn't think there's anything safe about standing, how wrong is that? The point of safe standing is that large barriers between rows are erected through which it is impossible to move or fall over. [Image.](http://www.the92.net/news-blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF0125.jpg) People are not crammed in, people are not free to go and stand anywhere they like, there is no swaying tide of fans as seen in old videos from before Taylor - **this is not terracing, not even close.** 

In fact, it's a lot more than a compromise between the Taylor Report and those who pine for the days of a decent atmosphere. At virtually every Premier League match (and every LFC game apart from friendlies..I think) there are significant portions of the crowd who will stand throughout. Most away fans, and certain sections of the home fans. They just will, and them doing that as opposed to sitting isn't the issue here - it happens, this is the reality. And the reality is that this is actually dangerous. People do fall down the stands and get hurt, particularly away (Liverpool) fans when a goal is scored. It's not comfortable and it's pretty pointless that the seats are there where there is usually standing. I consider the safe standing proposals an evolution of safe stadia protocols, building on the past couple of decades, not a reversal or even a compromise. It's not called 'safe' standing as a trick or anything like that.

One other thing that struck me is that she seems to suggest a couple of things about terracing and standing being a significant cause of Hillsborough. This makes me very confused. If it was standing that caused it, why are we challenging the SYP and Thatcher government? Where's the injustice if it was a non-human accident caused by standing. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely know that Aspinall and others in her position are not stupid and they don't blame terraces for the event, but she's making this association which I can't get my head around. Every other saturday the Kop was crammed, far too crammed, but the crush didn't happen. Countless other stadia across Europe, the world, were the same. Yes, others occurred but the frequency is very low and doesn't suggest it was actually a cause. Hillsborough was not a disaster waiting to happen at any stadium in England with terracing, it was a combination of several terrible human mistakes in the organisation of a football match.

Basically, the suggestion that safe standing is an insult to Hillsborough seems to defy the impression of events which I've just given (my impression). I don't feel this is a good move by the families, invoking the tragedy for something which doesn't really fit. Please understand that I don't mean they are cheaply using it as a weapon, I do believe they are genuine and upset with the safe standing campaign. But that reaction is borne out of poor information and/or reasoning. Believe me, I'm glad we don't have terraces any more, despite the romanticism of it. My father has told me they were really unpleasant in his experience as a kid, frightening even. Without saying that the nature of terraces caused Hillsborough, it's certain that they were dangerous and unhealthy, of a different era - just go and watch that black and white Panorama video about the Kop. But it's just not terracing and it's unfair to associate safe standing with that. So that's what I reckon.

tl;dr it is safe, and I can't get the implied connection between what is being proposed, and the Hillsborough disaster.",0,1355378175,null,0,false,0,c7ftjq9,t3_14qc1e,t1_c7ftjq9,t3_14qc1e,null,1430660497,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

Tobacco doesn't lead to acquisitive crime and I'll be honest nor does cannabis. The mental health link in adults has never been proven, so why not legalise it with an age restriction of say 21?

Alcohol leads to disorder more than cocaine because of availability; legalising Coke would be like shooting yourself in the foot... You'd be making so much more work and mess for society to clean up.

Heroin and Crack ruin lives, plain and simple. They are the bobsleigh upon which many people have ridden the slippery slope to the bottom of society. A good many people have fallen from height due to these substances and they are illegal for very good reason indeed.

Remember the pass he made to Ramires in the home game against Barca last season?

Just saw Ramires behind him after he stole the ball from Messi, one point of the finger to tell him where the pass is going, Ramires makes the run, and the pass is right there, beating what's arguably the best defense in the world. There are plenty more passes but those two are just some really important and beautiful ones. 

He was also voted as the Player of the Decade in the EPL in '09.

While I can understand the need for the investigations and such, since it -is- the Police's job to do that, that's also my point. The Police are paid to do this, so why did they wait until he was dead?

Ok yes, Jimmy Saville probably personified the idea of the jolly old man to an entire generation of people, but that doesn't mean prosecuting him for crimes against people of that same generation is a bad thing, quite the opposite.

Given the apparant size of this investigation, there are a few questions that must be asked.

1:If his activities were known, why was he given free reign over a children's hospital?

2: If his activities were known, and he was considered untouchable, why were his partners in crime also considered as such?

3: What was he doing specifically to protect them?

I have an idea that this isn't about Jimmy at all. It's about someone who was close to him, who now has an enviable or prosperous position, and could see it coming back to bite him in the event of it being found out through the usual channels. Call me a conspiracy nut, but the sheer size of the investigation says to me that someone somewhere wants to wave a big piece of cardboard that says Look! Look! Look at all we're doing to help!""

true,nitrous2401,null,null,"Alright, so this is from the show Supernatural and whatever 'lore' is lying around about the end of days and shit. They say for Lucifer to rise up and destroy the world, there were [66 seals](http://www.supernaturalwiki.com/index.php?title=The_66_Seals) that needed to be broken. Once Lucifer's out, the four horsemen come out to fuck shit up ~~and party~~. So, by the transitive property, breaking the seals means the horsemen are released. 

Back to Misfits. We see Nadine and (presumably) the four horsemen arriving; my proposal is that the connection between her and them is that she could be related to one of these 'seals'. 

Now to the SCP side. /r/SCP will help you for a more detailed walkthrough, but basically the SCP (to ""Secure, Contain, and Protect"")  Universe is about a secret world in modern life where different organizations - the Foundation (the ""good guys""), the GoC, the Church of the Broken God, etc - rush to try and find and contain anomalous objects or creatures called SCPs. They use different methods, and for different reasons, ranging from trying to keep humanity safe to maximizing profits by selling the strange objects. There are multiple storylines to help cultivate the hundreds of different ideas people have about the universe.

Specifically, the whole Nadine/horsemen reminded me of [SCP-231](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-231) (be warned, it's kinda graphic in description - *most* of them aren't this bad) although I definitely have to say the connection is slim. I was just excited about a similarity between Misfits and SCP stuff, really. Anyways, this particular SCP is pretty much one of those seals that were talked about earlier. A young female who will give birth to some demon thing (transitively, the horsemen that come later) that will destroy the world. Nadine also seems to stop herself from doing anything with Rudy, and is also a nun, so I was thinking that if she goes to the dark side, if you will, she'll bring about the end of days.

true,YankshireRose,eng-durham,Durham,"Went through something remarkably similar back in October.  Had Infinity at old address.  Asked them to move it to new address (less than half a mile away from old address).  Was told the installation would need to be three weeks in the future and they'd charge us for the installation, giving some excuse about the exchange and the need to put in a special new line for us.  When I pointed out that we would likely be on the same exchange as before, they didn't charge for the installation.  


I didn't feel it was my responsibility as a customer to pay for them to build their infrastructure.  Isn't that why they charge a premium rate of £42 a month, including line rental?  To cover the cost of the cables?


Waited in for an engineer.  Guy shows up, discovers the phone outlet was right next to front door and would need to be moved to be useable.  Drills a hole in my wall to put in the new cable.  Then says that a second engineer is coming to finish off the job, as his job is only to put on the Infinity box.  Leaves.  No new guy comes.  Phone BT customer service to ask when second engineer will come.  Told he'll be there by six.  No engineer.  Phone again.  Told engineer will be there next day.  Repeat until 10 days later proper engineer shows up from BT and sorts out the mess.  Line was supposed to be 80Mb.  We're lucky if we get 25, thanks to throttling.  Don't download lots, but we do watch a certain amount of streaming video?


First, document - they can give you the first names of the people you speak with in the call centre, as well as the times of your previous calls.  I'm writing a whopping letter of complaint, but from what I hear from friends in the area who've been screwed by BT in the past year, it will likely go on the pile and not much will come of it.


Secondly, BT gave me £10 per missed appointment.  I also got them to give me a credit for the crap customer service I'd received.  It's nice to have almost three months free BT as a result of the credits, but I really would have preferred to not have had a hole in my wall for 10 days and to not have been lied to/placed on endless hold/told things were being escalated by every person I spoke to, etc.  Would have just been nicer to have, you know, the internet service we paid for without spending a total of 10 hrs on the phone with customer service.

The only reason they're impatient, sarcastic and rude is because they've taken a day off work hanging around for an engineer who never arrived.

==================

All in it together
---------------

TWENTY NHS trusts are running a consortium to opt out of national pay rates, creating lower levels of regional pay for hospital staff. However, the Eye has found that three of the trusts in the South West Pay Consortium have given significant pay increases to their chief executives and other board members.

The Northern Devon Healthcare NHS Trust saw the biggest rises. NHS trusts show top pay in bands, and chief exec Jac Kelly's annual pay jumped from the £125-£135k band to £140-£145k. Four other board members also saw increases.

Edward Colgan, chief executive of the Somerset Partnership NHS Trust, another of the West Country cartel, saw his salary increase from £120-£125k to £130-£135k.

Both trusts told the Eye board pay had gone up because the trusts had got much bigger. A spokesperson for Northern Devon said the ""salary increase was to reflect the additional responsibilities and accountabilities"" of taking over community health services, and Somerset said the same.

Somerset Partnership's annual report also says that board pay is determined by a ""principal benchmark"" of ""national public sector"" rates supplied by consultants Hay — ironic as the trust is looking to break away from national pay levels for its lower staff!

Another chief executive, Frank Harsent of Gloucester Hospitals Trust, had a pay rise from £185-£190k to £210-£215k. The trust said this was a ""one-off, non-pensionable, lump sum payment"", not a permanent rise, and was given to ""to buy out a performance-related pay element"" of his contract.

Health workers and local MPs have been campaigning hard against the consortium's lower pay plan, with some success. One trust, the Royal Bournemouth &amp; Christchurch, pulled out, and at the end of November health minister Dan Poulter called the scheme ""heavy-handed"", although he also claimed he could not stop the trusts trying to opt out of national NHS pay structures. 

Serco babble
------------

SERCO's plans to replace up to 140 community health staff in Suffolk with a call centre, computers and accountancy backup from India have hit stormy legal waters.

A local health pressure group, Sudbury Watch, has instructed lawyers to challenge Servo's ""new model of care"" (Eye 1327) because its says NHS Suffolk failed to consult the public over the significant changes as iris obliged to by law. Sudbury Watch has warned health chiefs that they will face judicial review proceedings if they don't stop Serco's proposed reforms and start meaningful public debate.

When fleece won the £.140m, three-year contract, which includes orange of specialist services including cardiac rehabilitation and neurological services, it promised that patients would not notice any change and would be able to access NHS services the same way as before. But within two months it was announcing a reduction in the number of community hospital and care beds and the axing of a number of frontline practitioners, such as community nurses, health visitors and therapists.

Its Serco-speak internal consultation documents passed lathe Eye claim its ""remote monitoring of patients"" and ""patient in the pocket technology"" will ""improve productivity of community nurses and therapists"".

""Building on existing Serco scheduling and rostering software and our knowledge of call centres and health call handling, the Care Co-ordination Centre will release mom time secure by improving clinical staff utilisation,"" the documents say. ""It is a model that Servo already successfully implements across a wide range of public services.""

And how will it reduce the need for hospital and care beds with a growing elderly population? It plans to get people out quicker by introducing ""five-day packages of care within community hospitals"". Patients will then be seen at home, where a ""case manager employs motivational interviewing to encourage optimal patient self-management"".

Serco has clearly teamed little from the criticism of the call-centre system it operates for its out-of-hours GP services in West Cornwall, where the company had falsified performance data and was found not to have employed enough ""qualified, stalled and experienced staff to meet people's needs"".

As Sudbury Watch chair Peter Clifford said, it all looks more like Serco seeking to boost its contract profits, rather than improving patient care: ""While we appreciate NHS Suffolk's financial difficulties, we believe that our elderly folk deserve quality care from experienced practitioners, not just being 'serviced' by Serco at the lowest cost possible using less qualified staff."" Indeed.

Pathological mire
-----------------

WHEN service giant Serco joined forces with Guy's and St Thomas' and King's in one of the biggest NHS clinical outsourcing ventures, it promised to ""enhance"" the hospitals' highly regarded pathology services. Four years on, ""loss-making"" laboratories at GSTS Pathology LLP are being cut and departments merged in an attempt to stem £5.9m losses.

Six senior scientists are to lose their jobs on Christmas Eve when St Thomas's 45-year-old medical toxicology lab is closed. The lab analyses samples from hospitals including Great Onnond Street and the Royal London for the treatment of severe brain injuries. It is also the only one in London — one of just eight in the country-providing specialist toxicology testing for substances like ethylene glycol, found in antifreeze.

Staff complain that closure will leave the south of England without a comprehensive clinical toxicology service and that the delay in sending samples to Cardiff or Birmingham could be critical. Other restructuring will mean a million blood tests a year, collected by local GPs and sent to St Thomas', will now have lobe couriered on to King's in south London, where they will be processed overnight. Concerns over the safety and feasibility of the move mounted when managers admitted last week that continuing problems with a new computer system meant plans to ""go live"" this month have been delayed.

Last year the Eye reported how GSTS's determination to win more business and boost profits had been accompanied by an increase in the ""numbers of clinical incidents"" and the fact that serious untoward incidents were ""not always handled appropriately"". Recently documents obtained by Corporate Watch under freedom of information detailed 400 such cases last year, including the loss or mislabelling of samples. At the same time Sr Thomas' and King's were bailing out GSTS with extra funding and losing £2m and £800,000 respectively.

Even before the latest changes, staff morale was low, with some senior scientists leaving and others protesting that its international service had been ""decimated"", and that there was a lack of investment in development of new tests.

But GSTS CEO Richard Jones told staff in October that they were eyeing up some ""potentially very attractive business opportunities"", including ""reconfiguring"" the laboratories in the bankrupt South London Healthcare Trust (Eyes passim), as well as expanding services across the East of England. The company has already taken over Bedford hospital's pathology labs. So that's all right, then.

1) She bought the house in 1997 for £54k. A £54k mortgage would have payments around £250 a month so she'd almost be able to pay it out of benefits 

2) The arrears are £9k. Even at the full £180k market value that is nearly a years mortgage payments on a repayment mortgage so it isn't like they've kicked her out for missing a few months as is implied at the bottom of the article and it suggests that she owes a shitload more than she would have done on a £54k 25 year mortgage she's remortgaged it quite considerably.

So in short, most of the reason she's in the shit she is in is because like many people she lived beyond her means using the increase in the value of her home to fund her unsustainable lifestyle and now it has come to bite her in the arse.

Nothing has changed and nothing will change from the public knowing this. It requires action by government which will not happen. Osborne has pumped a couple of million extra into HMRC to track down tax avoiders but it means nothing if the loopholes are actually legal.

It means less crime because of wealthier population and better policing, which means less crime-related losses and lower insurance premiums.

I don't do much for royalties, I prefer flat fee buyouts of my performing rights, but I do have some friends that do a lot for royalties, and losing income is just annoying.

I guess it's comparable to shoplifting in some ways.

Imagine if *everyone* was shoplifting from a supermarket. Do you believe that they would just accept that and *not* try to find methods of preventing theft? They are losing money, and just accepting it means that they continue to lose money, whereas fighting it makes a point to those considering doing so, discourages the practice and also means that they might be able to make a little more money.

Tesco a year or so before that.


Couldn't be happier - we spend £70-90/week for 2 adults and a cat. That includes food, toiletries (i.e. toothpaste, bog roll) and booze (usually two bottles of decent plonk and a bottle of spirits if necessary - also includes soft drinks.

Why do we use?

We started off when living in a flat in London without a car. Now we have a car and could easily walk to a supermarket, but I find our spending is 100% controlled and I know my share of groceries never goes over £200 a month. My bathrooms never run out of TP, there's always deodorant, shaving foam and toothpaste. If I need a new razor, it appears magically in the bathroom. Heavy soft drinks and clinking bottles are a thing of the past.

I think you'd have to be a mug to spend time and effort going around a supermarket these days. 


Edit: People are mentioning replacements. Ocado text you a few hours before they arrive to say if they've made any changes. 9/10 times it's 'none'.

Edit2: If you have o2 moments, grab a £25 off £75 and above shops that's going at the moment.

""Between 1999 and 2002 Brown sold 60% of the UK's gold reserves shortly before gold entered a protracted bull market, since nicknamed by dealers as Brown Bottom. The official reason for selling the gold reserves was to reduce the portfolio risk of the UK's reserves by diversifying away from gold. The UK eventually sold about 395 tons of gold over 17 auctions from July 1999 to March 2002, at an average price of about US$275 per ounce, raising approximately US$3.5 billion. By 2011, that quantity of gold would be worth over $19 billion, leading to Brown's decision to sell the gold being widely criticised.""

But finding an analogy helps to put my argument in terms that can be generally understood, and brings it out of the abstract to give people something to hold onto.

&gt;Comparatively the internet pirates are tanks and stopping them is practically impossible.

This attitude is one of the problems. Stopping or reducing the effects of piracy (or even just getting pirate websites to pay us royalties, which is where most of our problems come) isn't something that we *can* view as impossible. I completely agree that we will never completely stop piracy - especially whilst the copyright laws so broad that you're probably breaking the law just by ripping CDs to your computer - but I don't agree that we can't reduce piracy.

The same was done for public smoking, the use of illegal drugs and underage sex, all with some degree of success.

&gt;people would just go back to doing it with physical copies in person.

Once again, it's more about reduction than completely stopping it. Physical copies are potentially much more limited in scope, and the effect will probably be lesser. There is surprisingly little information about this that I can easily find though - presumably no one was looking too hard when this type of piracy was at it's height.

&gt;I haven't been able to afford music since I was 13

Potentially surprisingly, this is another problem that I completely agree with (and one that I personally bring up in passing with those that employ me for recordings). Music is getting increasingly expensive, and it was somewhat difficult to find legitimate methods of legally listening to music on the cheap.

With the rise of spotify and other similar free services - which all pay royalties to performers - there is now much *less* excuse to do it. Even spotify premium isn't *that* expensive if you want it without ads or limits.

However, at some point, you should pay money for an album. You talk about repaying them in the way of concerts etcetera, but what about session artists? What about recording studios and their staff?

I can't talk so much about the latter, but certainly the former - who get brought it to do one recording and receive royalties on the album if they want them (or can have their royalties bought out) - suffer if you are only supporting through concerts and band merchandise.

Those things do *not* support musicians who are neck deep into the field that I'm testing the waters of. We don't get paid every time an artist performs a song if we only did their album recording. We just get a couple of pennies every time you buy the track (quite literally, a couple of pennies. From the top of my head, I think my union suggests something like 5-15 pence/track/sale.

If you want to see the hobbit you have to make a choice:

- Do you want to see it in 48FPS or 24 FPS? Peter Jackson intended it to be seen in 48FPS. If you want this then make sure the cinema you're going to has the right format.

- Do you want to see it in IMAX? Then you need to get on a train and head to Glasgow. There is only one IMAX type screen in edinburgh and it is at the cineworld at fountain park. HOWEVER it is a lieMAX cinema! Basically it's a fake IMAX built out of converting a normal screen to imax style. It's smaller and doesn't have the full viewing angle of IMAX and is basically a waste of your money.

- Do you want the comfiest cinema? I suggest screen one at the Cameo cinema. A cameo cinema membership costs £30 and gives you 3 free tickets. (£20 for students). Once you have the membership tickets there are very cheap, especially if you go on a monday (£3.80 member tickets).

- Another good option is to go to the Dominion cinema on a wednesday using orange wednesdays. They have a really nice screen and you get sofas/really comfy arm chairs to sit in.

* Manchester has a 24 hour bus system I believe. You may be able to get student rates and it will be your best friend. You can either pay for each bus trip or look into cost effective week/month passes. You can also get anywhere in the UK pretty fast with the rail, 2.5 hours to London.

* It will more than likely be cheaper to buy things here, a trip to Ikea or any secondhand/charity store will sort you out for everything.

* Most people buy their food from supermarkets. They are all somewhere between Walmart/Target and Tom Thumb/Wholefoods in terms of quality and range. There are also lots of good convenience stores (think Kroger) that are often near student accommodation.

* VAT is tax applied to any luxury good (read most goods). VAT adds 20% to the price of products, but unlike America all prices are displayed with VAT already added, so what you see is what you pay. Remember that £10 = $16 so though things may look cheap to you, they may not be!

* Manchester climate? Expect rain and cold. I've yet to go there and not see rain. Bring your mittens.

true,ClutchHunter,english,North London,"&gt;But finding an analogy helps to put my argument in terms that can be generally understood, and brings it out of the abstract to give people something to hold onto.

I just didn't think it was an accurate one. 

&gt;This attitude is one of the problems. Stopping or reducing the effects of piracy (or even just getting pirate websites to pay us royalties, which is where most of our problems come) isn't something that we can view as impossible. I completely agree that we will never completely stop piracy - especially whilst the copyright laws so broad that you're probably breaking the law just by ripping CDs to your computer - but I don't agree that we can't reduce piracy.

You can reduce piracy, but only for those who aren't tech savvy. Anyone that is will get around any block you could even think of implementing. You can get to the non-tech savvy people without breaking the internet. I'd say my attitude is realistic. 

&gt;Once again, it's more about reduction than completely stopping it. Physical copies are potentially much more limited in scope, and the effect will probably be lesser. There is surprisingly little information about this that I can easily find though - presumably no one was looking too hard when this type of piracy was at it's height.

Indeed because it was kept quiet. I'd argue it's no more prevalent now than it was then, just easier. 

&gt;Potentially surprisingly, this is another problem that I completely agree with (and one that I personally bring up in passing with those that employ me for recordings). Music is getting increasingly expensive, and it was somewhat difficult to find legitimate methods of legally listening to music on the cheap.
With the rise of spotify and other similar free services - which all pay royalties to performers - there is now much less excuse to do it. Even spotify premium isn't that expensive if you want it without ads or limits.
However, at some point, you should pay money for an album. You talk about repaying them in the way of concerts etcetera, but what about session artists? What about recording studios and their staff?

I won't buy albums as long as labels are trying to censor the internet, an unlikely but potentially very damaging ideal. If I go to a concert then as far as I'm aware the label gets nothing, which I'm glad about. 

It's a shame about everyone who *isn't* involved with the labels, but I really despise them that much. ",0,1355416018,null,0,false,0,c7fzh4q,t3_14lq1t,t1_c7fzh4q,t1_c7fypdf,null,1430663355,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The Ego is the psychopath in him, without empathy, sympathy, or instinct, he's pure logic, always calm and collected. However, since he doesn't have empathy, sympathy, or carnal desires, he has to find other forms of entertainment. He resorts to violence and learning about the psyche of others for entertainment.

true,ClutchHunter,english,North London,"&gt;And this is where your input starts to become useful to the union - what things can we do to start reducing piracy? Having said that you think it's impossible, you've now said that you think it's possible and I would love to be able to suggest things to those people trying to come to some kind of conclusion.

I said it's impossible to stop it but possible to lower the rates of piracy among the non-tech savvy. In order to lower it you have to implement draconian legislation such as SOPA, PIPA, et cetera - which if you have any morality similar to my own you'd reject, and just put up with piracy. 

Ignoring legal stuff for a moment, I agree about pricing. I think you'd increase sales a lot if stuff was priced a lot cheaper, but I doubt that'll happen. This may just be my own ignorance talking but I tend to read that large media companies see each pirated copy as a lost sale and just assume that piracy is the sole problem, which is total nonsense. 

&gt;Except without statistical evidence of some kind to back it up, both of us are relying on what we expect which is sure to disagree.

Sure, but we can both agree it would have happened rather a lot in one form or another pre-internet, whether that's a large distribution of media or just recording a song off the radio. 

&gt;I don't understand how they're trying to censor the internet. You'll have to expand on how them defending their intellectual property is censorship.

Please stop saying 'defending their intellectual property' as if that automatically justifies anything they do. To me - what they're doing is akin to unnecessarily shooting a burglar because they were going to take a spare loaf of bread you had lying around. 

There are a few angles to approach the censorship thing from, but they all assume that the government(US, UK, whichever) is taking notes from the copyright industry. If you don't believe they are then we can go there too. 

Firstly, I'm sure you're aware of SOPA and similar bills. There are reasonably good reasons as to why they're bad pieces of legislation [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act). 

Secondly, I would *never* trust my government to take control of the internet, intellectual property enforcement or not. They show time and time again that they're not to be trusted and this vain attempt to stop piracy gives them the perfect opportunity to get their claws well and truly into it. Well, this and child porn, another thing that is equally futile fighting online(although the morality of it is vastly different). Sure, sure, call me paranoid, call me tin foil hat man, whatever. I just don't trust the government - anyone, even - with a creation that allows the free flow of information between every single human being on this planet.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;  For example, would it be cheaper for me to simply buy kitchen appliances there (pots, pans, etc.)? What about furniture (i.e. bed, chairs, etc)?

I would certainly expect so. Though most accommodation for rent will come part/fully furnished - that is you'll have things like a washing machine, bed, tv, dishes etc. 

&gt; I know cities in the UK are not exactly tailored for the use of cars as they are where I am from so would my primary form of transportation be walking and buses?

Why do you say that..? I guess we don't usually have the sort of grid-layout you see in the US, but most UK cities (well, every one apart from London is acceptable to drive in - they are all small) You can drive anywhere and everywhere if you want, but Manchester has a pretty decent public transport system which will be much cheaper than having your own car. The city centre in Manchester isn't that large, so you'll get a bus there form wherever you're living and walk wherever you need from there.  

&gt;  Are buses free or would I need to purchase a bus pass? 

There should be an option of getting a student bus pass. Once you have your student card issued from the university, go to a travel information centre (just ask someone in the uni) and you can buy a bus pass to cover the semester or the year. The bus pass will be unlimited, for use on any bus (almost, there are different companies - but usually one company dominates each area). 

&gt; Are farmer's markets popular in the UK?

We have farmers markets; Manchester will certainly have at least one. Most commonly they are held weekly or twice a week- usually in some public location like a park. They are usually fixed in that sense, so if you ask around you should find someone that will know where they are held. 

&gt; Any great areas to go running in Manchester that are generally not busy with people and have lots of trees?

I don't know Manchester really, but I'm certain there will be. [Here](http://www.manchester.gov.uk/directory/46/parks_and_open_spaces) is a link to a page with info about public parks. 

&gt;  I expect it to be very cold (at least for me) and should I bring mostly warm clothing?

What temperature are you used to? The UK is very moderate, we are not warm and not cold. [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_the_United_Kingdom#England) is a link to the wikipedia page with average temperatures. 


One other thing, the UK is relatively small and well-connected (particularly from somewhere like Manchester), so you'll definitely have the chance to travel to lots of other places should you want to.

That episode made me sad, but not at the same level as Tennant's departure in The End of Time. The difference is that Tennant's doctor went through a lot of emotional trauma and conflict, so the audience that stuck with it had reason to be attached to Tennant when he said ""I dont want to go.""

So far, Smith's doctor is still go-with-the-flow with just about every scenario. Think about how many times youves seen Tennant judge his own morality and ripped at the seams because of a connection with a companion; think about how many times youve seen 10 be brought to tears and emotional breakdown. Now think about how often 11 has done it. 


When things go bad, 11 just gets stern, serious, and grieving as if he is above human emotion. This says a lot about the conversion; 10 died and hated what he had seen, being so emotionally attached, and turned into a happy-go-lucky loon that knows how to disconnect himself. But, it gets boring after a while. The crazy stories arent all that makes Doctor Who what it is. It requires finesse, knowing when to make the doctor feel human and making him form meaningful bonds with other characters. 


11 wouldnt say ""I dont want to go"", he would say something more like ""I hope the next is better than me"" or something; anything that associates his role as a sort of god overlooking the universe. He doesnt have real connections with people, it seems pretty superficial thus far. The connections between characters made the show great. The crazy stories are a vehicle for the bonds between characters, they just keep it moving along in an entertaining way like any good story should.

I'm not saying you should donate, I'm not saying you shouldn't. I thought long and hard before donating a couple of quid - I live in a city and the idea of trusting a pub landlord with this is completely alien to me, however in a tight knit village with people who knew him for decades...I can sort of see it. Even his partner didn't know and, from the sounds of it, is a bit shell shocked.

Anyway, it's an interesting discussion point: should these schemes be better regulated (ARE they better regulated and this was 'off the books'?)? Should families be less trusting with their money?

Is it easier to get a working visa with a degree? Why do you say that it is better to get a PhD instead of an MSc? I ask because here in the US, usually those in my field of study who get PhDs end up at Universities and those with Masters degrees tend to work in the public and private sector.

I'm not much for sports but I would love to go to a football game! I'm generally interested in music, ecology, and community service type things. It'd be great to have the option of joining non-academia related clubs. 

What is student accommodation? Is that a University owned apartment? Or if I were to rent an apartment the University helps with furnishing it?
I guess all I should bring would be clothing and my computer. Oh, and another question is phone service. If I were to cancel my plan with my US provider and bring my iPhone, could I get a plan with a UK provider and keep my current phone? Or is there some sort of region restriction on most telephones. I would hate to have to buy a new telephone if I do not have to.

Oh I understand. Cars are basically an essential thing to have here (besides New York City, at least). The whole public transportation system is most likely going to blow my mind. I guess I will just have to figure out what routes I will be travelling the most frequently and see which companies operate on them. Is it possible for me to rent a car and legally drive it with a US driving license? I know some driving laws are different and the UK drives on the opposite side of the road. I wonder if it would be a good idea to drive a car when I were to first get there.

Ok, that's good to know. Thanks for giving me some names of stores. I wasn't sure if places similar to Wal-Mart or HEB were available there or not. 

Oh sorry for not including that bit of information. I am from Texas so I am used to hot springs and summers (upwards of 38-40 C) and mild winters (0 to 15 C). 20 C would seem chilly to me haha. Also, for my degree I had to learn the metric system and celsius, so no problem there :)

That gives us three capable central strikers - Suarez, Borini, Sturridge. We play 4-3-3 and our bsst player Suarez has thrived in this system i'd be very cautious about changing it. Besides, of two of these are fit we could always try 4-4-2 if we are desperate. I think we'd be covered in the middle, making a pure striker a luxury not worth pursuing.

On the other hand for the two wide positions we'd have Sterling, Sturridge, Ince, and maybe Cole, Downing, Enrique (I thought this was worth sticking with for longer but apparently he's a fullback again), or Shelvey as against Southampton. Of these Sterling can't play the whole season, Ince is also young and untried at this level, Cole and Downing aren't good enough, Enrique and Shelvey may be playing in other positions. Buying Walcott as well as Sturridge if we have the cash would be one option but both in the same team is too few brain cells for my liking. We could do with a clever, experienced but physically fit wide forward. Someone similar to Maxi.

I honestly just think our main problem is getting the backline familiar and comfortable with Lloris behind them, rather than Brad.

Anti-democratic, anti-western groups will only continue to rise in numbers as immigrant muslim communities continue to grow, as our immigration system and integration is not addressed.

true,Helzibah,null,null,"&gt; What is student accommodation? Is that a University owned apartment? Or if I were to rent an apartment the University helps with furnishing it? 

There are a couple of different definitions for 'student housing', usually either:

* housing provided by the university itself, usually in large blocks on or off campus.  My university (York) has a wide range of accommodation in large blocks, either shared kitchen/bathroom areas over huge floors of people or more cosy flat/house arrangements.  This can often be quite expensive for just the accommodation, but bills are (usually) included.  The downsides include living with people a lot younger than you (and with more flexible work schedules!) and often quite restricted places for non-first-years.  International students often get priority though.  Note that we almost never do 'shared rooms' in the UK, your room might be small (enough space for bed, desk, wardrobe, sink), but it'll be just yours.

* private accommodation marketed at students.  This is nominally the same as any other private rented accommodation, but specifically marketed towards groups of students.  That means that the letting periods will likely be 9 months or a year based around the standard term time in your area, and contracts are often signed and sorted somewhere around February/March.  Finding housemates is fine when you're on campus, but you'd have to look at the uni specifically to see if there are any online facilities for helping single students find a group to live with.  Student-marketed accommodation is almost always fully furnished, some houses will even give you microwave/kettle/toaster and spare kitchenware from previous years, but it should be cheap enough to pick stuff up if not.

&gt; Oh, and another question is phone service. If I were to cancel my plan with my US provider and bring my iPhone, could I get a plan with a UK provider and keep my current phone? Or is there some sort of region restriction on most telephones. I would hate to have to buy a new telephone if I do not have to.

As far as I understand it, you might be in trouble there; I think the US and the UK use different phone standards...  If your phone is compatible, I'd highly recommend [GiffGaff](http://giffgaff.com/) as a provider though; the cheapest you'll find for a SIM-only plan (because they have a very limited support staff, which may be a downside for you).  Don't forget that you don't need to pay to receive calls or texts in the UK, so you may need fewer included minutes or texts than you are used to.

&gt; Is it possible for me to rent a car and legally drive it with a US driving license? I know some driving laws are different and the UK drives on the opposite side of the road. I wonder if it would be a good idea to drive a car when I were to first get there.

[Direct.gov should have all the information you need](https://www.gov.uk/browse/driving) on the legality of it, but I'd highly recommend taking a quick driving lesson or something just to get used to the rules.  We have a lot of [roundabouts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundabout) in the UK for example, and particular lane etiquette (always stay left, never undertake) that you just won't be aware of unless you do a lot of reading.

Spycatcher is pretty much a crock-of-shit, It has been widely discredited, the only real reason the book was banned because it acknowledged there was the M.I.5 and M.I.6 in a time when they was considered to not exist.
Official historians are banned from saying any of the good stuff, and will be taking orders from the organization involved, just remember this when you read them.
There is a Lot of shit when it comes to any release regarding S.S, S.I.S, or GCHQ. 

You have to remember people are going to have a reason why they have released them, official historians are going to be the worst; but don't discredit them completely. It took 3 weeks of intense lecturing to learn when a piece is credible or not.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"&gt;As long as the economic downturn carries on the poundland-type stores will do roaring trade.

On a National level, I totally agree. I just wonder if it's viable to have multiple similar stores in the same area. There's literally a 99p store opposite Poundland in my home town [with said Poundland reducing all their prices to .95 to compete]. Around the corner there's a Home Bargains, with a B&amp;M just up the road.

&gt;One thing I've always been curious about - I was in one today and a DVD of My Best Friend's Wedding for £3. Who the hell buys those crappy DVDs?!

Can't speak to the DVDs, but Poundland do some surprisingly good books. Granted you have to find them among the Z-List ""Reality TV"" star biographies, but there are some gems - Hardcover copy of the book Boardwalk Empire is loosely based on, Tinnker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, The Colour Purple, etc. etc.",0,1355433321,null,0,false,0,c7g4u6i,t3_14swsj,t1_c7g4u6i,t1_c7g4pf9,null,1430665963,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Putting somebody up top with a more consistent boot might make sense in the long term, even if it requires an adjustment period. Also, moving Suarez to the left would allow him to cut in towards his preferred right. If it doesnt work, he could still be moved back to the right, but i really think that he is best away from the center forward position.

A few years ago I on a flight of whimsy ordered a nettop from PC World, to  use as a media centre - the plan was buy it, rip out the HDD, double the RAM and install XMBC. Reserved it online, printed out the confirmation slip, and went in to pick it up. As the one member of staff went out back to get it, another started the usual cross-selling.

As I didn't need Office, or Anti-Virus, or printers or any of that twaddle, I told the guy that he'd be best served trying to deal with another customer - I didn't need any of the stuff he was trying to get me to buy. He says OK, goes out back, and a few minutes later both he and his other colleague come out and tell me that they can't find the item I'd reserved, and could I try again tomorrow?

A few hours later, an elderly man went into the same store, with the same reservation slip. He listened attentively to the sales men, agreed to quite a few ""essential"" upgrades, and was promptly handed the nettop PC he'd ordered. At which point he promptly changed his mind on the cross-sale items, phoned his grandson who was waiting in the car outside, who went in and paid for the device.

So given that they fucked up the deal to sell Nooks, and have had to go beg Amazon to let them sell Kindles, I'd originally planned to buy my new Kindle from Waterstone's

I figured it'd work out well - same price for the device as it retails for on Amazon, and buying the Waterstone's version would allow me to read almost any book for I believe two hours, whilst using their wi-fi. So I figured sit in their restaurant area, read a book for a bit whilst having a cofee, and if I like the book, buy it.

It turns out Waterstone's have crippled their version of the Kindle Paperwhite. It has a bloody advert on it for the store - which the regular version doesn't, and you can't run the jailbreaks you can run on the regular version, to install custom firmware, custom fonts etc. etc.

So suffice to say my Kindle Paperwhite will be arriving from Amazon. And so not only have Waterstone's lost out on the sale of the device, they've lost out on the eBooks I'd have likely purchased using their wi-fi service in branch.",0,1355435929,null,0,false,0,c7g5ofs,t3_14swsj,t1_c7g5ofs,t1_c7g4u8r,null,1430666363,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

Just watched his scoring highlights from the last couple years, he would defo have to be a central striker with Suarez out wide. My only two worries are that he seems to take too many touches sometimes, and if he develops a habit of that it could kill his scoring form in the Prem...also his goal celebrations will get him in a ton of fucking trouble in this league. I don't know where we'd find room to put Holtby in the already crowded group of young midfielders we've got, don't really have an opinion on the rest, Okazaki and Dost are the only 2 names I even recognize. 

Edit: also just watched some Dost highlights. He's more direct than Bony it seems, but defo doesn't represent the same physical presence I don't think. He has a great knack for being in the right place at the right time and just fucking hitting the target as quick as he can. Other than that, I didn't see enough to really gauge how complete the rest of his game is, which would be important if he wanted to fit into our system. Also, a lot of his goals came from pens when he played for Heerenven, so factor that into his conversion rate.

Recently he seems to have settled into the fullback role, but I wouldn't mind seeing him play in a few of those other roles again. He's also gotten a lot better at moving the ball forward since he's stopped moving around as much, so if he brings that to the midfield, he actually could play a box to box role as well, though that might be a bit of a stretch.

I think putting him on the wing exposes his weaknesses: he isn't the best passer (although he is prone to the brilliant one every now and again), he's quick but not fast, and he doesn't really go around people as easily as it appears from his work in the box.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"&gt;Why are people saying things like Waterstones?

Because theyr'e a relic of a bye-gone era, run by an M.D who doesn't know what he's doing.

Waterstone's currently have a little under 300 physical branches. And a good number of those are in buildings that charge ludicrously high rates. Having killed off all the competition through a combination of buying power, and the dissolution of the net book agreement, they expanded to a position of utter market dominance. 

And then, from this dominant position, they signed their own death warrant. By agreeing to let Amazon be their online presence. 

Which is exactly what Borders did. And it killed them. Waterstone's only got control of their domain name this year - even once the contract they signed with Amazon expired, the website still wasn't theres. It was owned by HMV, and ownership didn't transfer over to them until long after HMV had dumped the company from their portfolio, in a desperate attempt to stave off the creditors.

So now you have an autonomous Waterstone's. And what do they do? They hire James Daunt - a man who runs a rather nice, but ooh so exclusive and upper-middle class, fleet of small bookstores.

Daunt hates the notion of selling books below R.R.P. He's on record as saying it cheapens the value of literature. That's a bit of a problem in a world where you can buy the latest Lee Child / James Patterson / Whomever from Tesco / Asda for £9. Their response is that they're no longer targeting ""that market"" - they're - and this was the ooh so condescending quote he used - targeting the ""Serious Reader"".

As someone who not only used to read Lee Child books - but has actually met the guy? That personally offends me.

But whatever - they're now targeting the ""serious reader"". The problem is, the serious reader has realised that they can buy two, sometimes three books from Amazon, for the price of one from Waterstone's. And unfortunately we're in the midst of a double / triple dip recession - every penny counts.

Then there's his constant flip-flopping on the subject of Digital. Initially when he was parachuted in Daunt openly admitted the need for Waterstone's to embrace digital. What followed was a series of gaffes - they failed to secure the rights to the Kobo eReader [Asda / WHSmith].

Then, whilst calling Amazon ""Evil"" and their CEO ""The Devil"" he attempted to broker a deal with Barnes &amp; Noble - the one company in the world who *can* compete with Amazon when it comes to eReaders, to licence their Nook devices.

He failed. Nook went independent.

So. After repeatedly calling Amazon and their CEO ""Evil"" and ""The Devil"", he looks into the feasability of building their own eReader. Then someone tells him Amazon spend more on R&amp;D than the Waterstone's operating budget.

*For five years.* Amazon spend more in twelve months, in one department, than Waterstone's do running ~300 stores, a central hub, and their website, in **five** years.

So what happens? Waterstone's end up selling Kindles. Only they've fucked that up as well.

If I buy a Kindle Paperwhite from Amazon I get exactly that. I can modify the device - custom firmware, screensavers, custom fonts etc. etc.

If I buy it from Waterstone's none of that. Because they've crippled the device, by making it ad. supported. It displays adds for Waterstone's.

Add onto that the mis-matched marketing campaign - one poster emphasises the virtue of physical bookstores; whilst the next one touts the benefits of using Kindles?

That's why people are saying they're potentially up shit creak.

&gt;They're nothing quite like wandering around a book shop. It's a pseudo-religious experience for me.

Waterstone's is a business. It's not a library. It doesn't have a God given right to exist, any more than Borders, Woolworths, Comet etc. had to exist.",0,1355441110,null,0,false,0,c7g77yt,t3_14swsj,t1_c7g77yt,t1_c7g6gvi,null,1430667085,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18
