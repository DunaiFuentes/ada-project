true,[deleted],null,null,"Just to be clear, I don't care, I actually rather like the mix because I get better curries and everything is open all the time.  When I lived in Exeter (immigrant population 6) there were no good curries, chinese food or tapas and if you went out after 4 on a Sunday there was nothing open but the pub.

But then that is *my* personal preference.  What I was trying to get at is the idea that some people might not like it and their reasons may be quite justified.  They liked things how they were and had a reasonable expectation that they would stay that way.  They don't hate Polish Chocolate for being Polish, they just prefer Cadburys.

Perhaps calling an area ""Little XXX"" is pejorative, but it is also descriptive.  This shows the issue in language itself as well as simply peoples view points.  I like living near Ilfordstan.  But calling Ilford, ""Ilfordstan"" in reference to the large number and percentage of Pakistani people living there is pretty racist right?  But I like it.  They are a better people to live among than the white working class Brits I lived among in Dagenham.  So can I call it Ilfordstan?  Is it ok for you to call it that?  If someone says something nice about Ilford and Multiculturalism they can use that term, but if someone wants to criticise the idea of multiculturalism then that word would make them a racist wouldn't it?

What on earth does this have to do with anything? Unless you're suggesting  that Dr. Goldsmith somehow identified peoples genetic make-up *prior to testing* then your point has no relevence whatsoever to a genetic survey.

&gt; But you're not making claims about the geographical spread of gene markers, you're making claims about the genetic make-up of the British population.

Nope, you're setting up strawmen - again. I am talking about the genetic make-up of the English as it is the English who are supposedly the 'mongrel nation'.

The subject of geographic spread is important because the findings on Celtic gene markers were a side-finding on a project that actually had different aims - but if you'd read the literature (as you claim to have done) then you'd know that.

Well, the only proof you've shown against my interpretation is your [30% figure](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/vfdnf/ed_miliband_being_worried_about_foreign_workers/c543ur2) - a figure which you pulled out of your backside - so forgive me if I don't bow to your superior reasoning.

&gt; Surveying on a geographical basis wildly skews the data, when you're interpreting it as representative of the population at large.

Why include do you feel the overwhelming need to include urban areas? The urban population in discussion is drawn from rural areas - mostly during the industrial revolution. I don't think we need to carry out a genetic survey to see that the post-war immigrant population carry significantly fewer Celtic phenotypes (even allowing for interbreeding).

&gt; The point I was making was geographical vs. representative, not English vs. British.

I disagree. To be honest, I think you're still just fixating on any reason for you to disbelieve it.

That doesn't alter the fact that exterminating the Taliban is a worthy act in it's own right.

&gt;genocide is against any group of people

Well you've just ruined the meaning of genocide then because any army is a group of people. This is not about what **afghans** are doing, it's about what Taliban are doing.  There is a difference.

Oh and just a friendly heads up, it's ""foment"" not ""ferment"".

Sometimes the acts of ""us"" are crimes, I agree. That is not the stated goal though. Those who commit crimes are breaking the rules, and are punished. Those who unintentionally hurt others in the process of hurting Taliban should not be punished. In war, civilians die. That does not make war always wrong.

Our mission isn't to go out there and behead teachers, to bury women up to their necks in sand and throw stones at their heads until they die. That's them. We kill them. That's our mission. People die in the process, and that's bad, I agree. Does that mean the process shouldn't be undertaken? No. Does that make the process itself immoral or unworthy of carrying out? No.

* At the bottom of the ramp take a left along the pedestrianised area past the small, glass Tourist Information Office.
* In the Distance you will see a large building with Roman Columns that resembles the Parthenon - on your right will eventually be the Town hall with a large Statue of a lady relaxing in a pool (This is affectionatly known as the ""Floozie in the Jacuzzi).
* Walk up the steps, past the Floozie and pass to the left of the Council House and with the Parthenon looking building on your left (That's the town hall), towards a circlular area infront of a building containing another McDonalds, a Pub and a few other small shops - I think there's a Nandos in there too - you can walk again up the small set of stairs and into this building
* Pass through to the other side which takes you to the War Memorial and following the boarded off area where they are constructing the new library and the Rep Theatre on your right.
* Follow the signs and enter the large building on the far side of the construction work, which is called the International Convention Centre &amp; Symphony hall.
* Walk straight down the middle of this building to the doors at the far end.
* Through the doors, back outside, there will be a bridge over the Canal infront of you - go over it and up the stairs on the far side and the Pitcher &amp; Piano will be on your left hand side!

 However, you have to accept the fact that this is where the series has turned. Personally Nine, Eccleston, is my favorite out of the modern Who's and Matt Smith's quirkiness is kinda rubbing me the wrong way as well. 

 11 Has survived way more then he should and while I could just say 'wibbly wobbly timey wimey' and move on I still find that I come back to this series. This is because, underneath all the different doctors and their personalities, it is still Doctor Who. There are still those really epic moments where you just want to say ""That's the doctor""

&gt; What happens to my broken wrist and uneducated children then ?

I don't know. You wait for it to heal and you get your kids a laptop?

You're juts focusing on some hypothetical problem and ignoring the non-hypothetical and very real FACT that the same group who is handing you out free education is also using tax money to MURDER PEOPLE IN THE TENS OF THOUSANDS.

It's up to you to decide if you think your hypothetical problems justify mass murder. Personally I don't think they do.

Also, your hypothetical is not a problem. I'm just accepting it for the sake of argument. In reality the market will solve all these things far more effectively than the government. The only erason I'm not making these arguments is because they are necessarily unprovable in advance but there is overwhelming evidence if you look for it that things would be much, much *better* absent the state. You'd be more likely to live longer, you'd be more likely to get good healthcare your child would be morel ikely to get incredible education. But all of this is up to you to look up. we could argue it forever. the important question is the one I asked above: how many deaths is fair price to pay for you to receive your favourite government hand outs?

Primarily, you pose a question in the title which is not addressed in the article itself. Also, considering the way Chelsea is usually referred to, the title of this submission is more correct than the title of the article itself


&gt;Physical presence, speed, trickery and a solid long range shot is what Givanildo de Souza, also known as Hulk, can bring to the right attacking side of Chelsea’s play. How badly does Chelsea need him?

Again, does or do? This opening paragraph in and of itself is a little simplistic and comes off slightly immature


&gt;Sturridge, Torres, Kalou and Mata were all used last season as right forwards. Out of the lot, Sturridge seemed the most effective with Mata looking a waste playing a right forward’s role as he performed much better playing in the hole behind the striker. Take a look at the four names mentioned, Sturridge and Torres both prefer central roles with Kalou being released by the club and Mata looking more effective playing behind the striker it seems as though our number one target should be a wing/forward.

This is quite messy and again lacks focus. Mata played a minimal amount of matches on the right, he was used initially wide left and then moved central. Frankly, the most impressive player in the right-forward position last season was Ramires, not Sturridge 

&gt;Hulk is capable of playing as a striker and a winger/wing forward. That versatility is what Chelsea lack in the attacking area of their game. Hulk would sit comfortably in the 4-3-3 which Chelsea are well accustomed to or could play on the wing if we go with a 4-4-2 or 4-2-3-1. This would give the likes of Sturridge and Torres to be played as strikers in which, quite frankly I believe, they would revel.

The first two sentences here are the only ones sticking to the brief you assigned the article. Chelsea may have been accustomed to a 4-3-3 in days gone by but we lack the personel for it at present so play the 4-2-3-1. We haven't seriously played 4-4-2 for a long time. The last sentence needs serious work, not only is it incredibly poorly written, your key point is that you feel 'two strikers played in the striker's position would revel'. Redundant, to say the least


&gt;Is Hulk worth his price tag? You would find few nodding their heads at that question. Porto as always are driving a hard bargain, it remains to be seen if Chelsea will oblige and slash the cash.

You're not really saying anything here. The first part is anecdotal and the second could be applied to any team Chelsea do business with


&gt;With Hazard and Marin added to the ranks, the midfield looks solid. The addition of Hulk would bring balance and versatility to a long season ahead of us.

In the context of a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3, Hazard and Marin are not midfielders. Our midfield looks shockingly weak in fact, with ageing players and a lack of a creative outlet

&gt;It remains to be seen whether the transfer will go through. The player and club both seem to be interested but the fee could ironically force Chelsea to drop out of the race. However, Chelsea need to sign a player of his versatility and quality to complete their attacking line up if they fail to sign Hulk himself. With that being said, how good a player Hulk is will only be revealed after he performs in a top league

All over the place. The epiphany here is that if Hulk can't be signed, the closest thing should be a plan B.

The title was a mistake when the post was published and I have corrected in everywhere, except the link itself. (For obvious reasons I cant change the link)

When I say right forward I mean right forward on top in a 4-3-3. If I'm not mistaken, Ramires played on the right side of the 4-2-3-1 formation, a more midfield territory role than the 4-3-3.

""You're not really saying anything here. The first part is anecdotal and the second could be applied to any team Chelsea do business with""
You have got to be kidding me with that comment. It is quite obvious Porto are driving a hard bargain with Hulk. We bought Hazard for 32 million and Hulk is worth around the 30 million mark or less, anything more is what Porto, in particular, are chasing after. I don't see anything wrong in stating that. If in saying that Porto are driving a hard bargain I am wrong, then I am assuming you must be having comments on most journalists covering this story because I am not the first to mention it.

In my opinion it is irony because Chelsea are known to spend large sums of money on players. City and United backed out of the Hazard race, Torres bought in for 50 million quid. It goes to show that Chelsea do not usually get prized out of a fee, if they want their man they get him. In this case it seems Chelsea aren't willing to play that game which in turn sounds out to be ironic given the history of transfers by Chelsea.

I appreciate criticism and I would definitely look into the valid points you have given about my article being all over the place and the weak opening. Apart from them, we are all entitled to our opinion, I work for Chelseafc-blues to share my opinion. You are more than welcome to share yours.

Chelsea won out because of chats he had with RDM, Abramovich, Joe Cole and the key role he was promised in the new-look Chelsea. We did not blow out bids by United and City

Lyon drive a much harder deal than Porto, as do Spurs to be honest. Porto do so much business with Chelsea the negotiations are fairly straightforward, for the most part. Hulk has a higher transfer fee because his club has not accepted his departure as a certainty, he has an astronomical release fee clause too. You can't use one transfer fee to estimate a 'correct value' for another. Hazard's deal has nothing to do with any potential Hulk deal. This is the ridiculous logic Liverpool fans use when they say Carroll cost £-15m since they sold Torres for so much, it doesn't change the fact the Carroll deal was vastly overpriced

Porto hold all the cards, trying to get a high price isn't 'driving a hard bargain', it's just common sense. Driving a hard bargain would have been more applicable if Lille kept raising the price of Hazard and initiated an international bidding war, even when they knew he desperately wanted out. Levy drives a hard bargain, Chelsea bid £40m for a Modric who wanted out and he said no, he thought he could get more than that and had no desire to sell for less than a ludicrous sum of money

I'm sorry about the Amy intro, there's nothing I can do about it. I'm American, I have to live with it too. Though I have the show on DVD and Netflix so I don't need to live through it.

Some points to refute though... Amy remembered Rory and the Doctor when others didn't because she grew up with a crack in her wall that affected her brain. And the crack didn't rewind everything that ever happened concerning the DOctor because the Doctor decided to step into the crack before we could see it all rewind. He even says ""I hate repeats"" referring to going back to his previous incarnations. 

Furthermore, Moffat didn't write The Girl Who Waited, Toby Whitehouse did. And creating a paradox? That's nothing to get your knickers in a twist over. Paradoxes happen and just plain exist all the time, even without the Doctor's interference. The universe is big and complicated and I'm sure tons of paradoxes exist. Same with River Song existing in series 5 finale.

Besides, the Doctor goes on about no guns and no violence and don't cross your timeline but he does all those things many many times. They're not ""rules of the universe"". They're more like guidelines.

true,animorph,null,null,"&gt;I didn't like his face for one. I didn't like the sexual tension with Amy Pond. I HATE the introduction to each show ""When I was a girl I had an imaginary friend""

It's a shame you included that paragraph, because the rest of the post is really interesting, but that one is just stupid. So what if you don't like Matt Smith? There is no ""sexual tension"" between Amy and the Doctor - just her unrequited urge to bone males, and the introduction thing is purely an American invention. Deal with it.

&gt;Despite living in what is essentially an alternate timeline where he never existed in the first place?

No, this is where it gets ridiculously complicated again. Rory *did* exist, but the memory of his existence is erased. As the Doctor says, ""half eaten plates of food you can't explain"", it's the idea that they leave and the memory of them is lost.

However, because Amy has lived next to a crack her whole life, and then travelled through Time with the Doctor, it gives her a special ability to remember things that were forgotten.

Rory comes back as an Auton because he is still in Amy's memory, and the Nestene Consciousness just used those Romans she remembered to turn into Autons. Rory got included in that because of the picture of him in fancy dress as a Centurion.

Similarly with the Doctor, becuse Amy remembered what was, she was able to bring everything back. Yeah, it's stupid, and it's not my favourite explanation, but I'm able to run with it.

&gt;River Song, a person who wouldn't have existed if the Doctor hadn't taken Amy and Rory traveling in the first place

Ok, bear with me. This bit is complicated. River is able to exist because she is conceived in the future - after the rebooting of the universe. A future where Rory is human and him and Amy are married on board the TARDIS. Despite in the Roman-present Rory being an Auton.

This is why, in my opinion, River genuinely doesn't recognise him in the Roman camp (and does call him ""that centurion"", because the memory of his existence has been erased, she doesn't remember her father. However, this doesn't change the future, i.e. her being conceived, because everything does return to the situation that allows her to exist. Which is also why she does not remain as Melody Pond.

&gt;is triggered by her being given a diary shaped like the TARDIS

I think this is why the TARDIS has been given so much more presence in series 5 and 6. She is THERE and she is a trigger for a powerful memory. The Doctor uses her to force Amy to remember her previous timeline with the Doctor (something old, new, borrowed and blue etc.). Again, it is the idea that time travelling alters the way you perceive the universe. It's why Rory wasn't the catalyst, he hadn't travelled with the Doctor much at that point.

Amy was able to recall the Doctor because she perceived the universe differently and was able to remember an alternate timeline.

&gt;Next, in The Girl Who Waited, Moffat again demonstrates his love for solutions that undo the problem ever having existed.

Eh, that wasn't Moffat's episode. Honestly, anything ""canon"" to do with paradoxes is not canon. It changes from episode to Doctor, depending upon the Almighty Plot.

&gt;Only now, we find out that the Doctor was never in danger of dying at all, thus making the drama of the entire season, well, undramatic.

Well we knew he wouldn't die. The show wasn't going to end. The mystery wasn't whether the Doctor would remain dead, but *how* he escaped death.

&gt;just 11 sucks, and I miss Tennant.

Seeing, the beginning's bad and the ending's bad (but the middle is good). There are eleven freakin' Doctors. Consider how *they* have messed with Time before launching into Eleven.

The bid was rejected because they did not want to sell at any price, not because Levy was negotiating or driving a hard bargain.

Someone who now realises I was fortunate enough to be born into a privileged background due to a random throw of the universal dice, someone who went to a public school in the UK and private school in the US, someone who sailed into Cambridge, someone in short who for much of my life was blithely unaware just how much of a winning hand I was dealt even before I started playing.

Someone who has never lived on a sink estate that is terrorized by a few scum bags. Someone who has never worked hard and seen people who refuse to work better off. Someone who is very unlikely to be the victim of crime, much less likely than someone from a poor background. Someone who reads The Guardian which studiously avoids covering up the failures of the benefits system or of social workers, whereas people on sink estates tend to read the Mail or the Sun which cover them in great detail. Plus they actually know people who are ripping off the system, unlike privileged types like you.

Do enlighten us with your insight into chavs, which I'm sure you'll confuse with 'the poor' because you've met neither.

I want a manager who speaks english naturally, which AVB does. This is not my only requirement, but this is a big concern because of how other Spurs managers where treated from the beginning because they didn't speak english well enough.

I have no idea how Blanc's english is. He did fine at Bordeaux but that was a smaller club in a lesser league. IIRC, he had trouble with Gourcuff personally, which raises a flag because he was their best player and you wonder how he'll do with 10ish big egos in our squad (especially if he doesn't speak the language).

I also think AVB got screwed a bit at Chelsea and can still be a fantastic manager. I'm not wedded to AVB and will have an open mind with whoever we bring in. It's not like we're choosing between Alan Curbishley and Fat Sam!

true,HPB,eng-durham,Durham,"Copy/pasted from a few sites or you could read the koran, go to a mosque or ask a muslim. It's common knowledge :

To muslims, islam is more than a religion - it is a guide to living your life. Both Quran and Sunnah (that make Sharia) guide Muslims:
- to the right path to Allah 
- to good morals,
- to good deeds for the benefit of humanity and environment
- to the way to perform ritual worships
- to learn lessons from old nations
- to the governing rules of marriage, divorce, contracting, borrowing &amp; lending money, etc of social relationships.

Muslims believe that all human beings will ultimately be judged by god for their beliefs and actions in their earthly lives. In judging human beings, god will be both merciful and just, and people will only be judged for what they were capable of. Suffice it to say that Islam teaches that life is a test, and that all human beings will be accountable before god.

With regard to martyrs :

It was reported in the hadeeth of al-Miqdaam ibn Ma’di Karb that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The martyr (shaheed) has seven blessings from Allaah: he is forgiven from the moment his blood is first shed; he will be shown his place in Paradise; he will be spared the trial of the grave; and he will be secure on the Day of the Greatest Terror (the Day of Judgement); there will be placed on his head a crown of dignity, one ruby of which is better than this world and all that is in it; he will be married to seventy-two of al-hoor al-‘iyn; and he will be permitted to intercede for seventy of his relatives.”

The points I raised in my previous posts aren't *my* opinion. It's islam.

But it wasn't really until Moffat took over for series five that there were real overarching story lines throughout a whole series. Sure, there were two-episode arches that were AMAZING (Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead, anyone? And that was Moffat's doing, as well). And the closure for series four was (in my opinion) pretty perfect. But you can't say that the writing during the past two series hasn't blown your mind in the least bit. I'm not going to go through and protest your arguments one by one because animorph covered that pretty thoroughly and I agree with most, if not all, of what animorph counter-argued. It seems to me that you are missing a big aspect of Doctor Who: the whole concept revolves around writing and rewriting history.

true,McCackle,eng-sussex,West Sussex,"&gt;  ""Ilfordstan"" isn't complimentary because you're not acknowledging multiculturalism but perpetuating the right-wing view that cultures come in and take over in some way.

I think this is a perfect example of how a debate gets shut down by a rush to judgement, however well-intentioned, about someone's motives and use of language. You condemn StupidUK for his/her use of language, but do so entirely based on your definition of how the term should be interpreted without entertaining even for a moment that it may be different for him/her (not very multicultural of you). He/she even explained how they use that term affectionately, but apparently that's not allowed - I wonder, is 'Chinatown' offensive? Because although I can see how Ilfordstan implies some sort of wholsale change of identity, 'Chinatown' is used quite widely and as far as I'm aware inoffensively in various cities to describe a smaller area with specific services or features with a distinct ethnic character - like 'Little Poland'. Someone could use those terms in a xenophobic or xenophiliac way, and I'd argue the same could be true for Ilfordstan or Londonistan (as our French cousins like to say).

But of more concern to me is that your rigid insistence on what other people's words mean does exactly what it shouldn't - shut down debate. You're leaving StupidUK no way of expressing an experienced reality - that sometimes in some places cultures *do* come in and establish themselves (take over is I agree too strong, but then that was your straw man phrase and not what anyone else said) in a way that existing cultures find challenging to varying degrees. I would argue, and I think the lessons of New Labour's term and Miliband's apology today bear this out, that failing to allow existing cultures the opportunity to voice concerns about the introduction of other cultures only leads to problems. If we believe in multiculturalism, let's allow people to voice concerns without jumping down their throat or beating them into submission for having different cultural norms and perceptions to you. I'm not saying we tolerate racism, but equally we don't have to shoot first and ask questions later.

http://www.politics.co.uk/news/2012/06/22/miliband-confronts-bigot-gate-in-immigration-speech

If you look at the Conservatives in opposition they said they'd impose a immigration cap. They said they'd replace the Human Rights Act with something that doesn't include silly stuff like [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_8_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights). Of that what has actually been achieved?

I think once you leave government and talk to some normal people, you realise that immigration is not popular amongst the sort of people who fear losing their job or having their wages forced down. Also most people don't believe the elite idea that inside every illiterate and devout Somali or Afghan peasant is an English person just waiting to hatch out with the right encouragement, namely generous benefits and the right to legal aid.

If you're leaving a 'leave next door', 'leave in bin', 'leave round back' note, make sure you SIGN IT.
If you don't want to leave a note but want goods left or posted then make sure you inform ebay or whoever, when you're giving them your address details.
Include a mobile phone number.
Be aware that goods coming from abroad may have Duty and Import VAT to pay on them.
Don't ring the day before asking what time the driver will be there. Ring in the morning when the driver has had chance to sort his route out and he should be able to give you a time to within an hour.

That's a neat rule, albeit a little dogmatic. I'm not sure that it holds true in the inflexible way you suggest. In an increasingly multicultural society, how clearly defined is it who is and who isn't in a particular marginalised group? Is a slur always a slur or does it depend on how it's used by whom and for what reason?

&gt; There's ways of discussing immigration without being racist. I'm not shutting him down based on his choice of words, his own words condemn him.

There are ways of discussing immigration without being racist but apparently not without being *called* racist. *Part* of the discussion has to be about people's prejudices or perception of prejudice, and to my mind that can only happen if we conduct the debate giving each other a little benefit of the doubt. That doesn't mean you shouldn't challenge language you feel's inappropriate, it just means one needn't seize on that aspect and use it to dismiss their whole point. 

&gt; I don't buy your argument that telling someone that the word ""Ilfordstan"" is racist entirely shuts down debate and prevents them from expressing concern about immigration. That's irrational and indicates a very small vocabulary/capacity for articulation.

It wasn't your objection to the term, it was your fixation on it to the exclusion of what StupidUK was trying to say. Pointing out that you object to a particular phrase is fine, but I think you used that objection to mischaracterise and ultimately dismiss the point that was being made.

true,McCackle,eng-sussex,West Sussex,"&gt; If you're not sure, then don't use it. It's not exactly necessary to your life to use racial slurs. If you're white then you shouldn't use racial slurs, if you're straight then you shouldn't use homosexual slurs, etc.

So people are the best judge of the terms they use and what they mean? I do broadly agree with your comments on racially loaded terms but I just think we should be conscious that context matters. I don't use racial slurs, but I'm sure I use terms in conversation with my gay friends which others might perceive as 'homosexual slurs' but which are nothing of the sort.

&gt; I didn't use it to dismiss his whole point. You're being defensive. 

I've read back, and I was overstating.

&gt; I can only respond to what someone has said, I don't know what they meant to say that somehow came out in a racist way. If someone says ""that's racist"", it is reasonable to say ""OK, here is my argument rephrased, without racist aspects"".

I agree with that wholeheartedly, I just think it's also a good idea for the person pointing out racist language to do so without backing that person into a corner.

&gt; My post, the top one in this thread at the moment (depending on how you sort it), explains how you can discuss immigration without being racist.

Seen it, generally agree.

&gt; The second it becomes a generalisation like ""muslim immigrants did X negative thing"" or ""Chinese immigrants have Y negative impact on my life"", it's not just innocent commentary on a legitimate issue, it's an excuse to be racist, xenophobic or whatever term you would prefer me to use to describe someone that has an issue with people who are from another country or have different colour skin. I'm not about to be nauseatingly patient with people who dismiss that and try to explain that their specific brand of racism is OK.

Of course generalisation is a recipe for prejudice, but it seems that in many people's minds that's become an injunction against talking about concerns about the impact of a particular culture or cultural group *where issues actually exist and are not simply the product of paranoia or prejudice*. I suspect that a lot of that's got less to do with immigration than it has with integration issues in some areas, but I really don't know.

Here you go:

&gt; As soon as the Taliban retreated, they were replaced - by the warlords who had ruled Afghanistan immediately before. Joya says that, at this point, ""I realised women's rights had been sold out completely... Most people in the West have been led to believe that the intolerance and brutality towards women in Afghanistan began with the Taliban regime. But this is a lie. Many of the worst atrocities were committed by the fundamentalist mujahedin during the civil war between 1992 and 1996. They introduced the laws oppressing women followed by the Taliban -- and now they were marching back to power, backed by the United States. They immediately went back to their old habit of using rape to punish their enemies and reward their fighters.""

&gt; The warlords ""have ruled Afghanistan ever since,"" she adds. While a ""showcase parliament has been created for the benefit of the US in Kabul"", the real power ""is with these fundamentalists who rule everywhere outside Kabul"". As an example, she names the former governor of Herat, Ismail Khan. He set up his own ""vice and virtue"" squads which terrorised women and smashed up video and music cassettes. He had his own ""private militias, private jails"". The constitution of Afghanistan is irrelevant in these private fiefdoms.

If your an American and don't approve of Guantanamo then you'll fit right in. 

Besides, i'm proud of the fact that when a nation violates human rights and international law as blatantly and brutally as the US does in Guantanamo Bay that European citizens will ask about it incessantly. Apparently that questioning doesn't lead to any introspection about maybe the fact that our foreign policy is wrong or at least *they* consider it wrong, no. It must be that they are obsessed, brainwashed etc etc. I don't care if you don't think there is any reason to criticise Guantanamo Bay but when I do or other people in my country and the EU do too at least take us seriously and don't discount the opinion.

Strategic location for projecting American/British imperialism into the middle east and central Asia. Also, oil pipeline!

I've never been. But I've been to Pakistan and I live in an area full of Afghan refugees who fled the mass murderous western invasion.

It's propaganda manufactures and propagated by western governments and their partners in the corporate media. Plenty has been written on this collusive phenomenon eg. see ""manufacturing consent"" by Chomsky.

Kelly's body is not built for FB and then there is Flanagan and McLaughlin who need a loan and more reserves, respectively.  Lucas is our only holding midfielder unless Henderson is an option.

My advice would be for your boyfriend to keep looking for another job (but I guess he probably is) and just be carefull, they can skate around employment laws very well, although a lot of managers will actually have no idea of the law.

Our elected officials, our laws and our facilities are supposed to be a reflection of the needs and desires of society; the preferences of the people who live in our country.

Mass immigration alters the population and skews these average preferences, which move away from that of the average British person. So on average people lose out in small ways that make being a British person in Britain worse than it was before 4 million people showed up who have different desires.

People don't see it abstractly though, when someone's area becomes filled with shit that they don't want or need they tend to bitch about the immigrant population which that shit caters for. Maybe you can rightly call them racists or xenophobic for this, but there's no escaping the fact that the place has changed for their loss and it's directly because of the population change.

That said I doubt a sledgehammer will help you. Although their viewed state is that of an Angel, their quantum state is likely something that is, in itself, in a quantum existence.

Like the Doctor says, you look and it's stone, you blink and it's not. If you're looking at it, it's just a smashed statue. But just like how you can't kill a statue, you can't kill rubble either.

One blink and it's back to killing you.

But as stone, no I do not believe they have any powers.

**ADDENDUM:** It's clear that Angels are made of something a bit more durable than stone (as shown in Flesh and Stone with bullets bouncing right off them) and are capable of regenerating into stronger stone forms when not observed (provided there is enough energy to supply them). That is to say, this is a bit tougher than your ordinary granite.

Donna wears a 20s outfit in The Unicorn and the Wasp and manages to snag herself a period dress in Fires of Pompeii. Martha keeps her outfit in Shakespeare Code, but it is just one of many strange things about her that are explained by her ""Fredonian heritage."" She wears proper clothing for the time in Human Nature/Family of Blood. In all the other episodes with those companions, the time period has either not been far enough in the past to make a real difference or has been in the future.

Amy's never particularly bothered with that sort of thing, except for to fit in during Vampires of Venice, but that is fairly consistent with her character. Also, that corresponds with a change in showrunners. Different writers nitpick about different things, and Moffat either just has never thought about period costume for Amy or has an overly-convoluted theory  about perception filters.

I agree that SAF wouldn't want to sell Chicharito, he obviously likes him.

true,dsnmi,null,null,"I had a discussion with some people about this very topic today. They were actual proper adults so it was a very refreshing change (they even understood what a claim was and how burden of proof worked). I'd discussed this issue with them a bit before but armed with the information gathered from this thread I was able to wander in a with a lot more confidence. When asked to back up the claim that ""The Royal family brings in tourist dollars"" they went about trying to find information that proved it. They couldn't of course because I've searched and you've searched and dozens of others on this thread searched and none can be found. They hunted for a bit but gave up. 

One said he couldn't find any evidence at the time and while it was hard to gauge how many people came specifically for the royal family he was sure that ""99% of tourists do something royal related when in the UK"". So of course I was able to pull out the helpful link you gave me and prove that in the only survey anyone could find a staggering 40% said they wouldn't hunt out anything royal related. They were big enough to admit that didn't look good (they're a much better class of person than you obviously). 

The Gaurdian article jolted them further and a friend who was there found [this little gem](http://www.cntraveller.com/awards/readers-travel-awards/the-readers-travel-awards-2011/destinations)  which proved that the main reason people visit London is for night-life, food, museums and theatres, no mention of the Royal family. Another nail in an already well nailed coffin.

The argument ended with one of them saying ""Well I can't find any evidence but I'm sure it's true"" which sums up your position nicely: no evidence but a lot of misplaced belief.

I have to go for a while now and interact with real people for about a month, I know of one other person who has claimed the Royal family brings in tourism and I'll be seeing them in two weeks. I'm looking forward to shooting them down in flames just like I did with my friends today and have in the past few weeks with you. 

I won't be around for at least four weeks but feel free to shout your angry responses into the silent and empty room if you like. Quote me line by line with your distraction techniques, hell go word-by-word if your therapist lets you, but I doubt I'll read it when I return in late July.

I think either airport would suit - Bristol is on the far side of the city from both the Motorways, but there are ring roads to get to it. Birmingham is off the M42 so you have to contend with average speed cameras and traffic management.

I don't think it is fair to say that media coverage of these incidents isn't equal ""across the board"", because quite clearly it is. Further, taking an attitude that we are somehow being singled out does far more to effect us globally. This attitude of institutional martyrdom amongst Liverpool supporters is perhaps understood, especially after the lies that some tabloids published after the Hillsborough incident, but in this case, where a person truly was guilty, we should welcome the media exposure. The absolute best thing we can do is loudly and collectively speak out when these incidents occur. As someone who stood on the Kop in the 80's and watched players like John Barnes get abuse from his own supporters (which I am proud to say my father always told them to pipe down or get filled in) I realize that we have come a long way, but it's still not enough.

That does kind of leave him open to blackmail a little so you can kind of understand the govt. reaction.

true,emericuh,lfcflame,,"I can understand how those from outside the city (or country) would consider United to be our greatest rivals, but as a native scouser who grew up there during the 80's (when Everton was at its best), I will always consider Everton to be our biggest rival. I would rather lose the double to United every year than finish below Everton in the table.

The difference is that, while United have claimed the top English spot we held for so long, they aren't as present in the city. If you live in Merseyside, there are blue noses next door, at your job, in the shops, on the bus, and in your family (my Dad and I are the only Reds in a family that includes loads of Evertonians. My uncle was a youth player for them in the 60s).

That being said, it is a healthy rivalry (I don't equate rivalry with hatred) and violence has always been rare, which is why it has been called the ""Friendly Derby"". 

The majority of locals that I encounter recognize that a groundshare would be a viable plan. Certainly the rivalries of Munich, Rome and Milan are every bit as fierce as our own, and they've managed to do so. While many people romanticize the idea of having our ""own"" stadium, I think it adds a special magic to derbies on a shared ground, as both teams are striving to prove who *really* owns the stadium.

The problems I see is that without a lot of public financing, Liverpool would end up spending the majority, as Everton are completely skint. ",0,1340447489,null,0,false,0,c54h1um,t3_vfpo5,t1_c54h1um,t1_c544vzy,null,1429210517,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

We decimated them before the negotiations began. Look into the actions of the special forces and Security Service (commonly aka MI5) prior to the negotiation years. They'd severely compromised the republican capability to fight.

You run out of people eventually.

&gt;Talking of a people's revolt, the Taliban could not have lasted this long without having the support of a significant part of the population, and if they were* this formalised standing army you describe it wouldn't need youths planting homemade IEDs at the side of the road.

I never said they were a standing army, I said they were an organised group. The Vietnamese used home made improvised weapons in the Vietnam war, that doesn't mean the people fighting the Americans were any less of an organised military group.

&gt;vThe military and political justifications cannot be trusted. It's almost nothing to do with the Taliban, it never was. Here is Rumsfeld talking in 2007 .

-AESCHYLUS, Prometheus Bound

Saturday. June 23rd is the centennial birthday of our modern Prometheus. A single human who afforded a wealth of knowledge that has altered the way in which we in the modern world do everything.

A human persecuted, criminalized and dehumanized for the ways in which he expressed his human love. A human that in desperation took their own life committing suicide by eating an apple laced with cyanide. 

A mythology almost forms in the spaces between these bits though it is completely true.

Alan Turing was homosexual. In 1952 the British government charged him with ‘gross indecency’ and afforded him the non-choice of imprisonment or chemical castration Just under 10 years since he had cracked the ENIGMA and single-mindedly ended WWII.

He is the outcast and criminalized father of computing.

As has been said, all this accounting malarkey should be done on mainframes but they may have actually outsourced the data manipulation and whoever is running that bit of the show may actually have implemented it on a network of distributed PCs (bit like the SETI search or the other program that looks for prime numbers - bog standard PCs get sent a bit of data each to process then send the results back).

If a virus/worm/trojan is on any PC being used for such activity then it will spread quicker than a dose of clap when the Navy's in town, and if some of those PCs are actually outside the jurisdiction of the company then all attempts to remove the problem will be that much more difficult.

Again be consistent. You are happy to lump all Afghan insurgents into a coherent block of stone raping, beheading militants. Yet, for the side you sympathise with you are more than willing to promote a multiplicity of nuances; the political actors, the noble troops, the 3rd party ta payers.

&gt; I think this was a valid moral goal.

To destroy a country over one man? Did you watch Rumsfeld and the network of sophisticated super criminal hide outs? If he is lying about motivation then the supposed moral crusade of the noble troops is based on a lie. Here is part of Tony Blair's invasion speech:

&gt; [It is more than two weeks since an ultimatum was delivered to the Taleban to yield up the terrorists or face the consequences. It is clear beyond doubt that the Taleban will not do this.](http://www.putlearningfirst.com/language/20rhet/blair.html)

[Yet another lie.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/oct/14/afghanistan.terrorism5)

In this year alone (just in the direct cases we know about) [~38 women and children have been deliberately accidentally killed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civilian_casualties_in_the_War_in_Afghanistan_(2012). The list of atrocities for [2011 is far longer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civilian_casualties_in_the_War_in_Afghanistan_(2011). That's an awful lot of new hate. The other thing to say is that that figure is grossly misleading. The definition of militant is any male of fighting age near a strike zone. That is why we only get stories of children dying because the administrations are refusing to count the innocent male deaths.

Personally I reject morality because historically, from church sponsored massacres to various collectivist states targeting the population for 'its own good', it has always been used to provide the rational for violence. I prefer effectiveness and honesty. Over 10 years later and Afghanistan is still no nearer concluding. It's safe to presume that was the intent all along. And it's funny because not a single war zone has been completed, yet new wars are being planned in Yemen, Syria and Iran.

We struggled after VdV came in? We were one point off Chelsea in fourth in the league at christmas and had topped our CL group after half a season with VdV upfront.

He should have put Bale in before BAE got injured? Bale had had a series of injuries that had left him weak and he performed poorly when he did get a chance. We got lucky that BAE's injury coincided with Bale's eventual return to full fitness and form.

Tactical changes were all forced on him? Yeah, losing Palacios meant we had to find someone else for CM, but giving Redknapp no credit for moving Modric inside and Bale to the wing is stupid.

Not at all, it supports my point as to why we shouldn't have more people having a direct say on the actions of our government. A democracy requries that those in charge are there at the say of the people. One vote by the people is all that's required for a democracy to work. Yes, quite often that vote is wasted on those who lie to us, and those who simply have strong personalities with no substence. But there is no need to repeat that mistake again and again.

I'm never quite sure whether to attempt to explain the concept of just war to folk like yourself, or just to give up entirely. Invasion is not necessarily an evil thing. In this case it was morally justifiable and completely legal.

&gt;Your Catholic priests seem to enjoy doing it. Hell, child abuse seems to be the favorite pastime in the UK if recent studies are to be believed.

I believe that's Ireland, but that's academic I suppose. You're using the oft-used Russian tactic: Anytime anyone points out something bad about them they point out something bad about the accuser, as if one wrong washes another. Firstly I'd just say look into Bacha Baz, but also consider the difference between a culture that abhors paedophilia and actively combats it at every level, and then a society which reveres those who can afford a young boy, and mark levels of success with how pretty the 5 year old you fuck is.

&gt;Yeah, you decimated them so much that you begged for them to turn up at the negotiating table, paid huge sums of money to stop them attacking from attacking your goons, your political elite had to make embarrassing public u-turns on the Taliban being the enemy, the Afghan people are turning to the Taliban in droves and you're in the process of getting out of the region as fast as possible. Yeah, that sounds like a real victory to me!

I think you're confused, I was referring to the IRA.

&gt;Yeah, because some random ""captain"" told you!

I'm not sure why you put Captain in speech marks. Is that you disbelieving me, or all members of the armed forces, or what? You honestly believe the Taliban *don't* commit atrocities like this?

&gt;The imperialist goons invaded their homeland for no good reason and raped, torture and slaughtered countless of their fellow citizens.

No good reason? They took in and sheltered a man who organised an attack which killed thousands of people. Are you such a fool as to suggest that despite the UN completely sanctioning a military invasion of Afghanistan that there was absolutely zero justification and the whole country would be just one happy hippie commune if we'd left the Taliban in charge? Are you that mad?

&gt;That would have made some sense if it wasn't for the fact that the goons and warlords the western imperialists have been propping up are oppressive bronze age religious autocrats too. Hell, they actually make the Taliban look good. Too much state brainwashing and not enough critical thinking is your problem.

Western imperialists, seriously now, drop the rhetoric down a few notches yeah?

Have western countries supported very bad regimes in the past? Yes. Do some western countries continue to do this to this day? Yes. Does that make the destruction of a very bad regime a negative thing? No.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;You are being inconsistent. You cannot say morality is judged on intent, then say well the end has been the taliban being killed therefore it is 'a good thing'. Your argument also presupposes that killing Taliban is an automatic good.

Course I can. There are types of good outside of morality. If I stop and help someone who has been stabbed that is a good thing, but I wouldn't call it a moral thing because to not do so would not be an immoral thing.

&gt;Again be consistent. You are happy to lump all Afghan insurgents into a coherent block of stone raping, beheading militants.

Not all, but I'm happy enough to say that those who fight are on the side which is doing those things. Guilt by association is a messy thing, but then so is warfare.

&gt;Yet, for the side you sympathise with you are more than willing to promote a multiplicity of nuances; the political actors, the noble troops, the 3rd party ta payers.

Could you highlight what you mean by this please?

&gt;To destroy a country over one man?

Not over one man, over a regime and a man.

&gt;Did you watch Rumsfeld and the network of sophisticated super criminal hide outs? If he is lying about motivation then the supposed moral crusade of the noble troops is based on a lie.

Did you ever consider that maybe he was just wrong? Further to that, there not being large cave networks in no way invalidates the motives or reasons for the invasion.

&gt;Yet another lie.

Not really. They were told to hand him over and they responded with ""maybe, if you prove to us he did what you say he did"". That's not what was demanded of them by both the US and the UN.

&gt;In this year alone (just in the direct cases we know about) ~38 women and children have been deliberately accidentally killed. The list of atrocities for 2011 is far longer.

This is war. People die. So long as it's not intentional then that is life. Where it is intentional, obviously perpetrators should be jailed.

&gt;The definition of militant is any male of fighting age near a strike zone.

That's absolute rubbish, sorry, but I've known a lot of guys go out there and they bitch and moan about rules of engagement. The trouble forces out there endure daily because they can't see someone with a weapon but they know they have one, or because they catch someone *at* a bomb but they have nothing on their so they have to release them, is constant. In order to make an arrest insurgents must be caught with evidence which proves their guilt. In order to engage, ISAF forces must be either coming under fire or being approached by an armed individual who won't respond to verbal and warning shots.

&gt;Over 10 years later and Afghanistan is still no nearer concluding.

Indeed, we went in unprepared to spend the time or the money required. We'd have needed 25-50 years to properly get anywhere in that country.

&gt;And it's funny because not a single war zone has been completed, yet new wars are being planned in Yemen, Syria and Iran.

Umm, Iraq is done, Libya is done. Also, planning for a war does not necessitate intention to go to war.

&gt;The Afghan war is so obviously ineffective regarding the official goals, I have to presume that there are ulterior motives.

As far as sharing a ground, i think it suits Everton more than it suits Liverpool, simply down to money, we can afford to build a new one, they can't.  Personally i'd like our own stadium, not because i dislike Everton but because i think of how much a fortress Anfield was, i want that back, i want teams to tremble at the thought of playing there again (ok it won't be Anfield but at ""liverpool's stadium""), if there's two teams playing there and one (generally) is better than the other, you can't create that aura of invincibility.  I also want the stadium to be red, not blue.

true,Hishutash,null,null,"&gt; I'm never quite sure whether to attempt to explain the concept of just war to folk like yourself, or just to give up entirely. Invasion is not necessarily an evil thing.

Not to an imperialist. Invading other societies, oppressing their people and plundering their resources is the favorite pastime of imperialist goons and their apologists. To people with morals, denying people freedom and self-determination is the height of evil. 


&gt; In this case it was morally justifiable and completely legal.

Thanks for giving us the imperialist point of view. 

&gt; I believe that's Ireland, but that's academic I suppose. 

Yeah, Catholic child abuse only happens in Ireland. Good one. 

&gt; You're using the oft-used Russian tactic: Anytime anyone points out something bad about them they point out something bad about the accuser, as if one wrong washes another.

It's called putting the problem in context. In this case, the Afghans are not uniquely prone to child abuse. It's a global problem. Brits, for example, especially love abusing and raping their children. 

&gt; Firstly I'd just say look into Bacha Baz, but also consider the difference between a culture that abhors paedophilia and actively combats it at every level, and then a society which reveres those who can afford a young boy, and mark levels of success with how pretty the 5 year old you fuck is.

That must explain why child rape is so rife among your Religious authorities and among the general public in your culture. They abhor it and fight it every level!   

&gt; I think you're confused, I was referring to the IRA.

Ok, its pretty much bullshit there too. Counter-terrorism had a minimum to zero impact in the peace process. Negotiations and consultation were the major factors which brought long term peace and stability. Newsflash: Killing people tends to just further piss off their friends and family.

&gt; I'm not sure why you put Captain in speech marks. Is that you disbelieving me, or all members of the armed forces, or what? You honestly believe the Taliban don't commit atrocities like this?

I don't tend take the words of invaders and military goons on faith. Of course they're going to demonize their enemies and make up stories to cover their asses. How else are they going to rationalize invading a defenseless and impoverished population who didn't pose a threat to anyone internationally and slaughter, rape and torture countless of them. I'm sure the Taliban do all sorts of nasty shit, but I'm also sure much of the hysterical claims by western governments and corporate media are outright propaganda designed to get the western populace to support the imperialist campaigns.  

&gt; No good reason? They took in and sheltered a man who organised an attack which killed thousands of people. 

Oh, not this outdated neocon nonsense again. Plenty of information has come to light since 9/11 which pretty much exonerates the Taliban entirely. Read this and get a clue please: http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2010/09/20/newly-disclosed-documents-shed-more-light-on-early-taliban-offers-pakistan-role/

&gt; . Are you such a fool as to suggest that despite the UN completely sanctioning a military invasion of Afghanistan that there was absolutely zero justification and the whole country would be just one happy hippie commune if we'd left the Taliban in charge? Are you that mad?

Yes, I believe there was little to zero justification for invading Afghanistan despite what the Security council mafioso sanctioned. The Taliban were actually a positive and popular force in the region who brought back the essentials of civil society and the rule of law to a lawless land fractured by civil war, banditry and anarchy. Did they have some shitty and repressive laws? Yeah, but civilization trumps lawless anarchy every time.

&gt; Western imperialists, seriously now, drop the rhetoric down a few notches yeah?

Why? You're very keen on regurgitating the ""talibans ist teh evilz"" propaganda narrative. 

&gt; You don't support the Taliban, you don't even care about them, you just hate the west.

You're right, I support the Afghan people and their right to freedom and self-determination from western imperialism. And I don't hate ""the West"", I hate western imperialism.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;Yeah, Catholic child abuse only happens in Ireland. Good one.

I never said this.

&gt;It's called putting the problem in context. In this case, the Afghans are not uniquely prone to child abuse. It's a global problem. Brits, for example, especially love abusing and raping their children.

It's an attempt to absolve others of their misdeeds because you defend them and oppose the west. You make an attempt at equivocation in order to create moral parallels and thus in your mind remove justification for action, yet it doesn't remove justification for action even if the two situations were remotely comparable.

&gt;That must explain why child rape is so rife among your Religious authorities and among the general public in your culture. They abhor it and fight it every level!

Among the catholic church certainly there has been a great deal of child abuse. That is not my culture though so I'm not sure what effect that has upon me. As to the idea that the UK in general has high levels of paedophilia, I'm not sure why you'd say that, but it sounds suspiciously like a friend from Pakistan saying that he was amazed how much rape happens here, because in Pakistan ""there is no rape"".

&gt;Ok, its pretty much bullshit there too. Counter-terrorism had a minimum to zero impact in the peace process.

I can't be bothered digging out sources for you, so I'm just going to say whatever on this one. The security service had numerous double agents directing the SAS to intercept IRA actions in NI.

&gt; don't tend take the words of invaders and military goons on faith. Of course they're going to demonize their enemies and make up stories to cover their asses.

Is your world truly that simplistic? Do you really believe that hundreds of thousands of troops and civilians who went out there all went out with the desire to murder innocent afghans and then make up stories to cover up their deeds - these people must seem like complete aliens to you.

&gt;How else are they going to rationalize invading a defenceless and impoverished population who didn't pose a threat to anyone internationally and slaughter, rape and torture countless of them.

Well they could start with saying their goal was to depose the Taliban religious autocracy and replace it with something better. That's pretty good justification right there.

&gt;I'm sure the Taliban do all sorts of nasty shit, but I'm also sure much of the hysterical claims by western governments and corporate media are outright propaganda designed to get the western populace to support the imperialist campaigns.

Why are you sure of this?

&gt;Plenty of information has come to light since 9/11 which pretty much exonerates the Taliban entirely. Read this and get a clue please: http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2010/09/20/newly-disclosed-documents-shed-more-light-on-early-taliban-offers-pakistan-role/

I'm not reading a 3 page article from a site dedicated to criticising the US's foreign policy and nothing more. If you want, you can quote the relevant sections and I'll read them.

&gt;The Taliban were actually a positive and popular force in the region who brought back the essentials of civil society and the rule of law to a lawless land fractured by civil war, banditry and anarchy.

Oh come on. This is a group which [Amnesty International](http://www.amnesty.ie/news/taleban-should-be-prosecuted-war-crimes-afghanistan) says should be tried for war crimes.

You clearly have a massive confirmation bias. Anything which supports the idea that the Taliban are actually a horrible force gets written off as being western media propaganda. Yet somehow you yourself have this magical access to unbiased media which others don't bother to read, which supports and confirms all of your beliefs and confirms that all those you disagree with are wrong. How convenient it must be. You no doubt think North Korea is one little happy country too.

[Here's a video](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=dd3_1310954791) of 16 policemen from Pakistan being executed by the Taliban. That's your idea of civil society, I presume?

&gt;Why? You're very keen on regurgitating the ""talibans ist teh evilz"" propaganda narrative.

Right yes, the Taliban totally aren't immoral shits and are really just misunderstood rebels who occasionally engage in the odd beheading or child-rape for funsies.

&gt;You're right, I support the Afghan people and their right to freedom and self-determination from western imperialism.

No you don't, otherwise you wouldn't support an organisation which seeks to rule by force. The afghan people are neither free nor self-determining in any but the most primitive of ways with the Taliban in charge.

&gt;And I don't hate ""the West"", I hate western imperialism. There is a difference.

Imperialism requires empire or at least the desire to maintain ownership of a country. You're referring to interventionism. You don't like interventionism, and would rather just sit by while repressive governments and autocracies murder and kill their citizens. It's not your business eh?

Of course it is. You make it sound like he was singled out by the Govt. This is not the case. He was found guilty of a crime and sentenced. Infact he was given a choice of sentences. During the period after he was free to do more or less as he pleased, inclucing travelling to Europe twice for holiday (and, it is thought, to learn about the gay-rights movement which was taking hold in Europe at the time). Then *2 years* after his sentencing, which is a year after he could have stopped taking the oestrogen, he kills himself. I'm sorry but that is simply not torturing someone to death. Now I'm not saying it wasn't a contributing factor, but to lay blame entirely on this one small episode of his life seems overly simplistic and all too convenient.

&gt;&gt; you are saying that his sexuality made him a security risk in itself, which is a little silly.

I was indeed saying that the British Govt. saw his sexuality as a security risk. Sure, it seems a little silly now but in 1950's Britain with the Red Menace looming large and the constant threat of espionage I doubt it seemed very silly at all. He had high level clearance, knew a boatload of official secrets (the vast majority of what he did in the war was still an official secret) and was exactly the kind of person the commies would want. On top of that he was gay which he had to keep secret because it was illegal and viewed as immoral by a large portion of the country. That is a security risk, he is easily blackmailed. The British Govt. was worried about that.

&gt;&gt; so how does it make sense for me to be proud of him?

My point was more that we are not to blame for what happened to him. Absolutely we should feel shame for what happened to him, and we should also be proud of all he acheived because he was a freaky genius and he helped save the nation. But our pride should of course exist only on a national level, not personally. Feeling a personal sense of pride over someone that died before you were born would be weird.

 - Any peanut butter candy (Reeses cups, PB m&amp;ms etc)

 - Goldfish crackers (also animal crackers)
 - Smores-making things
 - A good root beer (esp for making floats)
 - Grape soda
 - Sweet tea vodka

&gt;That alone quite frankly does because that means Rumsfeld was 'just wrong' or lying. If we then consider there is evidence that the war in Afghanistan was planned before 9/11 the illegitimacy is obvious. The same can be said of the Iraq invasion.

You're changing the issue. You're talking about Donald Rumsfeld now. We were talking about the Afghanistan war and the morality thereof. Donald Rumsfeld is not relevant to this discussion.

&gt;Whether you like it or not your country is engaged in all manner of explicit and covert wars around the world and they all happen to be in countries without despots backed by the west but with key resources or a required transport routes.

I think you may be under the mistaken impression and that I'm an American. As to the idea that the US has spent hundreds of billions or trillions in Afghanistan in the last decade for resources or transport routes, I'd ask: What resources? What transport routes?

It does take a long time, but in my opinion it's worth it. You get to know the Doctor much better as you watch through different incarnations. You understand him better. And some of the Doctor - companion pairings are amazing. The Seventh Doctor and Ace are my favorite televised Doctor / companion. I have not finished watching everything, but so far it's all amazing. Even grouchy old Hartnell is just wonderful. Also, if you get done with all that, new and old, then you might want to see if you can get your hands on some of the Big Finish audiodramas. Those stories kept Who alive from the 90s till the renewed show in 2005. The Eighth Doctor, Paul McGann is amazing. He's pretty much known throughout the fandom as the awesome Doctor that got stuck with a crappy movie, but his stories with Big Finish are easily as good as anything in New Who. The dynamic between the Doctor and Charley Pollard is probably my favorite of all. Paul McGann and India Fisher have so much chemistry together that there really aren't words to describe how good it is.

I too am so glad to read this support. So much rubbish been spouted by the media lately. 

Just bought the book 'Special Too' off of Amazon, and it's just been delivered. It's the book on AVB. 

Haven't had time to read it yet, but just from the blurb, it talks about 'How he manages the human factor, and the very special professional and personal relationship he establishes with his players.' Now I don't know how exactly he does that yet, but I'm sure I'll get to it soon. 

Also, the quote on the back: "" 'Friend' is the best word to describe Villas-Boas "" Helton - FC Porto captain. 

So again, everything I've read about AVB doesn't suggest someone that is a terrible man manager. Infact his players seemed to adore him. It suggests more that Chelsea and AVB just weren't the right fit. 

Another point in the blurb: 'What he has come up against in the Chelsea dressing room and how it compares to Scolari's experience during his time at the London club'.

There is an overwhelming bias for children and women in the official casualties list. The lack of an official definition of what it means to be a militant, other than having it applied by western governments, is damning in itself.

Occupation also prevents any eastward extraction of oil annexing the oil rich lands of Saudi Arabia and Iran. Like I said look at it on a map.

One day if you ever grow up you'll realise what a dick you were when you made that post.

&gt;  So if it's not a civil matter, are you saying it's a criminal matter? If so: who makes the claim?

Yes it is a criminal matter. The OP has committed an offence under the Construction &amp; Use Regulations or the Road Traffic Act for which they've been found guilty, convicted and given a fine.

The Magistrates Court where the judgement was made is who will issue the warrant. The case took place at a Magistrates Court, not a County Court and is a criminal and not a civil matter. If the fine isn't paid or the money recovered by the bailiffs, it is referred back to the court. The court then issues an arrest warrant for the non-payment of the fine. 

The person is then arrested and detained in police custody without bail until the next available hearing, usually the following day. They are then put before the Bench where the Magistrate will hear their excuse for why they haven't paid and either grant them an extension or send them to prison for the number of days required for the level of fine if the defendant can't/won't pay.

The thing about Jimmy Carr's tax avoidance is that he has (hypocritically, it now appears) criticised others for similarly avoiding tax. So whatever way you look at it, he's deserving of criticism.

But yes, it seems stupid to criticise those who avoid tax rather than those who make the rules that allow them to do so. Of course, it's not quite that simple: the problem is that the tax system is far too complex. Given the amount to be saved, well-paid experts will find holes. The only way to fix it is to make the system much simpler, and that is difficult politically (also politicians like to create all sorts of exceptions and special rules to score brownie points with various groups).

Attacking those who avoid tax will just mean that people and organisations that care about their image might stop doing so (to some extent) - but those that don't give a shit won't.

David Cameron's comments do seem in rather poor taste given the circumstances, partly because he's partly responsible for the tax system, because he may have indirectly benefited from off-shore investments, and because it's rather blatant bandwagon-jumping - and an ill-advised PR move IMO.",0,1340490657,null,0,1340490842,0,c54nudz,t3_vi070,t1_c54nudz,t3_vi070,null,1429213822,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

true,Hishutash,null,null,"&gt; It's an attempt to absolve others of their misdeeds because you defend them and oppose the west. 

It's called putting the problem in it's real world context. You're trying to demonize the Afghan people by focusing on their social problems in a vacuum. This is so that you can ideologically defend the imperialist campaigns against them (a modern rehash of the old ""white man's burden""). This is another reason why I have trouble taking you seriously. You clearly despise the Afghan people so any talk of ""humanitarian intervention"" is just laughable.  

&gt; You make an attempt at equivocation in order to create moral parallels and thus in your mind remove justification for action, yet it doesn't remove justification for action even if the two situations were remotely comparable.

Except it does. If the Afghan people aren't as abhorrently evil as you imperialist supremacists want us to believe it completely demolishes your argument for intervening. This is what happens when reality clashes with ideology.  

&gt; Among the catholic church certainly there has been a great deal of child abuse. That is not my culture though so I'm not sure what effect that has upon me.

Ok, but the Catholic Church is a major institution in the western world. The fact that they have been effectively turning a blind eye to child abuse for so long says a lot about western culture.

&gt; As to the idea that the UK in general has high levels of paedophilia, I'm not sure why you'd say that, but it sounds suspiciously like a friend from Pakistan saying that he was amazed how much rape happens here, because in Pakistan ""there is no rape"".

No rape in Pakistan? What are you babbling about? Ah, this must be what they call the chewbacca defense. Well played.

&gt; I can't be bothered digging out sources for you, so I'm just going to say whatever on this one. The security service had numerous double agents directing the SAS to intercept IRA actions in NI.

That isn't what brought about the peace process. Counter-terrorism is at best a palliative. It brings about no solution to the underlying problems which incite and foment terrorism. 

&gt; Is your world truly that simplistic? Do you really believe that hundreds of thousands of troops and civilians who went out there all went out with the desire to murder innocent afghans and then make up stories to cover up their deeds - these people must seem like complete aliens to you.

I'm not the guy who's entire position here revolves around ""the talibans est zo evilzzz, we must invade their homeland and genocide them all!!"". Yeah, I'm the person with the simplistic worldview. And when armies invade the homeland of a poor, defenseless people thousands of miles away who couldn't harm anyone and then proceed to slaughter, rape, torture and terrorize them its not going to be for benevolent reasons.

&gt; Well they could start with saying their goal was to depose the Taliban religious autocracy and replace it with something better. That's pretty good justification right there.

""Pretty good"" justification for someone who is historically clueless and politically naive. The British and Americans have been terrorizing the globe under for centuries under such bogus pretexts. Also I guess you'd be perfectly fine with a foreign army invading your homeland and slaughtering your countrymen because your government could always be replaced with something better!

&gt;I'm not reading a 3 page article from a site dedicated to criticising the US's foreign policy and nothing more. If you want, you can quote the relevant sections and I'll read them.

It's a site dedicated to the critical analyses of geopolitics and world affairs. The fact that you're willing to dismiss them because they don't mindlessly regurgitate American state propaganda speaks volumes. In any case, the piece is based predominantly on declassified documents which anybody can check themselves. Here are some relevant quotes from the first page:

&gt; U.S. government documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and recently posted on the website of the George Washington University National Security Archive shed some additional light on talks with the Taliban prior to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, including with regard to the repeated Taliban offers to hand over Osama bin Laden, and the role of Pakistan before and after the attacks....

&gt; Officials described the U.S. decision to reject Taliban offers as a missed opportunity. Former CIA station chief Milt Bearden told the Post, “We never heard what they were trying to say…. We had no common language. Ours was, ‘Give up bin Laden.’ They were saying, ‘Do something to help us give him up.’” Bearden added, “I have no doubts they wanted to get rid of him. He was a pain in the neck,” but this “never clicked” with U.S. officials.

&gt; Michael Malinowski, a State Department official involved in the talks, acknowledged, “I would say, ‘Hey, give up bin Laden,’ and they would say, ‘No…. Show us the evidence’”, a request U.S. officials deemed unreasonable.[3]

&gt; According to the BBC, the Taliban later even warned the U.S. that bin Laden was going to launch an attack on American soil. Former Taliban foreign minister Wakil Ahmad Muttawakil said his warnings, issued because of concerns that the U.S. would react by waging war against Afghanistan, had been ignored. A U.S. official did not deny that such warnings were issued, but told BBC rather that it was dismissed because “We were hearing a lot of that kind of stuff”.[4]

&gt; Rejecting the Taliban offers to have bin Laden handed over, the U.S. instead pursued a policy of regime change well prior to the 9/11 attacks. Jane’s Information... The BBC reported on the Pakistani talks with the Taliban, noting that the Taliban were “demanding proof of his involvement in the terror attacks on the US” before they would consider handing over Osama bin Laden, who issued a statement saying, “The US is pointing the finger at me but I categorically state that I have not done this”.[14] CNN similarly reported that the Taliban was “refusing to hand over bin Laden without proof or evidence that he was involved” in the 9/11 attacks. Ambassador Abdul Salam Zaeef said “that deporting him without proof would amount to an ‘insult to Islam.’” But, he added, “We are ready to cooperate if we are shown evidence.” U.S. officials said evidence gathered linking bin Laden to other terrorist attacks were all the proof that was needed, but declined to provide evidence of his involvement in the 9/11 attacks.[15]

There is much more damning revelations on the following pages. 


&gt; Oh come on. This is a group which Amnesty International says should be tried for war crimes.

So what? This is a region that has been wracked by civil war and violent strife for decades. There is no major party in Afghanistan that hasn't committed war crimes. 


&gt; Right yes, the Taliban totally aren't immoral shits and are really just misunderstood rebels who occasionally engage in the odd beheading or child-rape for funsies.

You're right, the Taliban are just orks straight out of the Lord of the Rings! You haven't been brainwashed by infantile state-corporate propaganda at all! The British and Americans on the other hand are angels selflessly spreading freedom and democracy! Am I right?

&gt; You clearly have a massive confirmation bias. Anything which supports the idea that the Taliban are actually a horrible force gets written off as being western media propaganda...


Except for the fact that I have already explicitly claimed that the Taliban have committed atrocities. I just don't believe they're devil incarnate like you have been brainwashed to believe.

&gt; Yet somehow you yourself have this magical access to unbiased media which others don't bother to read, which supports and confirms all of your beliefs and confirms that all those you disagree with are wrong. How convenient it must be. You no doubt think North Korea is one little happy country too.

You don't need access to some magical unbiased media. You just need to exercise some critical and independent thought instead of swallowing state propaganda and corporate hogwash. 

&gt; Here's a video of 16 policemen from Pakistan being executed by the Taliban. That's your idea of civil society, I presume?

Uh huh, some dodgy video from liveleak? Good for you! 

&gt; No you don't, otherwise you wouldn't support an organisation which seeks to rule by force. 

I'm not the one who supports a violent, mass-murderous occupation which has been propping up a bunch corrupt, mass murderous criminals who make the Taliban look angelic. 

&gt; The afghan people are neither free nor self-determining in any but the most primitive of ways with the Taliban in charge.

They are much more free and self-determining under the Taliban than they are under western occupation and their  local stooges.

&gt; Imperialism requires empire or at least the desire to maintain ownership of a country. You're referring to interventionism. You don't like interventionism, and would rather just sit by while repressive governments and autocracies murder and kill their citizens. 

Humanitarian interventions is one the pretext for furthering imperialist hegemony. The British and Americans have a long history of violent, genocidal imperialism around the globe. There is absolutely no good reason to believe that they are in Afghanistan to rescue the Afghan people especially they have a tradition of propping up mass-murderous regimes and dictatorships around the globe to do their bidding. Please try to be the least bit skeptical.

&gt; It's not your business eh? Their country, their culture, so we should just leave them alone to kill innocents, right?

Yeah, we should. Since the British and Americans are among the world leaders in killing innocents it makes utterly no sense to support their involvement in the region. ",0,1340491469,null,0,1340492232,0,c54nzl4,t3_vffgr,t1_c54nzl4,t1_c54jekb,null,1429213900,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,spurchris3,null,null,"So, from reading the AVB book, it's very interesting in terms of understanding his training methodology, which seems excellent. Also the way he builds a positive atmosphere around the club (totally at odds with how it seemed to go down at Chelsea, suggesting the players clearly had something to do with it) there is also an interesting little paragraph about the time just before he got unveiled as Porto manager. 

At the start of May, 2010, the Porto coach was let go. By mid-May, AVB had a verbal agreement with the Portuguese president. However, if I have understood it right, he could only leave Academica at the end of a season as this was agreed in his contract - with 500,000 euros to be paid. If he was to leave sooner, obviously more compensation would have to be agreed. So he had the verbal agreement by the middle of May, and yet only got unveiled on June 2nd. This was after an apparent  'to and fro' where AVB released a 'politically correct' statement that he wasn't about to be joining Porto, before he did a few days later. It also coincided with the Porto president returning from holiday, then relieving the previous coach of his duties, then allowing a 'few days mourning' with a respectful silence from the club before appointing AVB. The reason he denied he was going to Porto in between the verbal agreement and the unveiling was because he was afraid news would get out and force the club into taking the agreement back. 

Which all seems strikingly similar to our situation now. Harry is sacked at the end of the season (I don't actually recall reading anything in the statement from the club saying 'the search for a new manager will begin now/shortly, which usually happens btw) and Levy goes away for personal reasons. There's a period of silence, coinciding with unsubstantiated reports that AVB has taken the job, which he then denies, probably to relieve pressure on the Spurs board so that any negative fan reaction doesn't build up too much to force them to change their decision. The story about not being able to be unveiled until July may make sense in this case, or he may just be unveiled this week. 

But yes, a strikingly similar set of events that make me think it's been AVB all along, and we needn't worry. ",0,1340493441,null,0,false,0,c54ocn2,t3_vhtag,t1_c54ocn2,t3_vhtag,null,1429214069,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

The only way to fix it is to make the system much simpler, and that is difficult politically (also politicians like to create all sorts of exceptions and special rules to score brownie points with various groups).

I think this is wrong. As I understand it, the complexity in the tax code comes precisely from it having to be regularly amended to make these sorts of schemes illegal. A simple tax code is very easy to manipulate.

The other thing is that Cameron is going to be the first PM to introduce a general anti avoidance rule, which bans in a generalized way financial structures judged to be primarily constructed for dodging tax. So he is at least doing something about it.

I believe this is finally the real deal. 

Google Translate of the linked article:

&gt;Ajax and Tottenham Hotspur have agreed on the transfer of the Belgian Jan Vertonghen to the English club. With the transition is a sum of 12 million euros. The defender must personally still come out with the club.

[Another source.](http://www.voetbalzone.nl/doc.asp?uid=167858)

And here's a quote from the Dutch guy on our forum:

&gt;Okay, just watched the repeat of the show with Jack van Gelder. To go into the very details of what he said: Ajax and Tottenham have finally agreed a transfer for Vertonghen. It's 12 million euro's + additional bonuses. Vertonghen has a clause in his contract that he gets 15% of the transfer money. But because Ajax originally thought they could get €20 million euro's for Vertonghen, they now get less money. So in turn they want Vertonghen to lower the percentage, so that they can compensate their loss of money. (Everyone on the show was surprised about this, saying: 15% = 15%, no matter the transfer money).

He also says this van Gelder dude wouldn't troll. ",0,1340496203,null,0,1340496568,0,c54ounk,t3_vi4w7,t1_c54ounk,t3_vi4w7,null,1429214304,11,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,11

They seem to believe that the last 800 years of statute law is completely ignorable and they are *generally* turned to the concept right around the time they get a parking ticket they can't be bothered to pay.

Don't worry though, you can cash in your birth certificate for hundreds of thousands of pounds by filling out a form and saying some magical bloody words!

Oh also if you turn up to court and the flag has frills on it you can just walk out because apparently that's a puppet court and they just pretend they have jurisdiction.

For the two seasons before this, Merton and Hislop had not only been aware of Angus's behavior, they were paid much less than him, they were friends with his wife, and basically were told if they said anything to anyone they'd lose their jobs. On top of this, Angus would constantly tell executives they were replaceable, told BBC Execs lies about Merton and Hislop's behaviour (for example, he claims Merton's mental instability extended to sexual perversion and that Hislop was 'trying to undermine the BBC'). 

There's no jealousy in that. They were being bullied, fucked around, forced into a corner and this happened. Watch back, the episodes before this, and they glare at him when he takes the high ground. 

I gained respect for Merton for this - Angus didn't respect Merton's privacy (EG, he told the papers about his breakdown after Merton told everyone not to say anything, then failed to visit him at all). Merton isn't a saint but, in this, he stood up to his bully. As did Ian (who, FYI gave many hints to Angus' drug use in Private Eye solely because Angus' wife was a subscriber).",0,1340503252,null,0,false,0,c54q46i,t3_vhozf,t1_c54q46i,t1_c54pl34,null,1429214940,24,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,24

true,catalyst_opal,colin-baker,Colin Baker,"I agree that i dislike ""super Fans"" since I've been a Doctor Who Fan since 1974. I would suggest someone start a /r/classicdoctorwho, or whatever you want to call it.  After reading the comments below, I also agree about the time investment. To also be even more honest, without these ""Super Fans"" all out there buying posters and dvd's, us old farts wouldn't have Doctor Who back at all. What OP and other ""Classic Fans"" do have when we watch the reboot, is greater understanding. I can watch the new Doctors and see moments when they are clearly acting or doing something in a ""classic Doctor"" way.  

What will never be in the reboot? The classic series...doesnt have to be that way...The plot device of ""The Time War"" is probably the nail in the coffin of tying the classic series to the reboot. No Grandaughter Susan, no Romana, no Rani...oh anything can be brought back in the end, sure...but it would be weak. I see the Reboot shows where he tries to avoid talking about his past and his family..if i wasnt a classic fan, i wouldnt find it as emotional as i do having seen Susan and other Time Lords. 
It's Doctor Who...but its not. For me, this is not so much an echo, more a reflection in a pool. 1974 was a long time ago, and that is when I first watched Doctor Who. Im not a know it all of the series. I simply enjoyed losing myself in it every weekend growing up.

Having said that...I must say its not all tears and moans, I love the reboot...in the end, its the madman in a box...Its like an old friend that was a best friend you havent seen in 10 years. Its just different. Remaining friends is in how you choose to deal with it.

Besides...no one gets more out of ""The Doctors Wife"" (reboot series 6 ep 4)Then those of us who have travelled with the Doctor since the classic series.  

tl;dr I've watched the show since 1974, The reboot fans are what they are. Fans who love the jokes, and dont realize they are missing out on a lot...which cannot be helped.",0,1340506534,null,0,false,0,c54qq9h,t3_vh71n,t1_c54qq9h,t3_vh71n,null,1429215247,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The answer to the question is, there isn't an agreed on answer.

&gt;The most complete glimpses into the Doctor's childhood occurs in the Virgin New Adventures novel Lungbarrow; however, as with all non-televised Doctor Who media, the canonicity of this story is unclear. Lungbarrow portrays the Doctor as being one of 45 cousins grown from the House genetic loom as an adult. (In New Adventures continuity, the Time Lords are not capable of sexual reproduction and survive through genetic looms producing a quota of cousins.) The Head of the Family Ordinal General Quences knew that the Doctor had a special destiny and built him a robot tutor called Badger and planned the Doctor's eventual rise to the post of President. His fellow cousins resented the Doctor's position and he spent most of his childhood being bullied by his cousin Glospin and was equally brutally treated by the Housekeeper Satthralope. Eventually he rebelled against Quences's grand plans and was exiled from the family, stealing a TARDIS and leaving Gallifrey. This depiction of events is seemingly contradicted by ""The Sound of Drums"", showing the Master as a child. The BBC Books novel The Infinity Doctors, for example, states that the Doctor was born from the loom, but it adds that he was also the son of a Gallifreyan explorer and a human mother.

I think the journal looks nice cropped out a bit. It irks me slightly that the journal is printed and not textured, but there isn't much you can do about that. Be careful with the depth of field. It creates a really nice effect, but you want to be very aware of what parts of the subject are going to come out blurry.

One year later the coding standards and in turn product quality went down hill, quite badly. The support team were run ragged with production servers falling over left right and center. 

Eventually, they had to reverse the move and started to bring all the core development back to Dublin leaving Bangalore to work on non critical functionality such as branding or plugin adapters.

I see the reason for this is quite clear. Universities in the US, Europe , Former Soviet Countries and other various locations have a long history and pedigree of teaching.

You'd tip at a restaurant, or anywhere that you're being served a meal.  Tipping for a coffee in a cafe is more optional, especially if its just counter rather than table service - here people tend to go more for the 'put your spare change in a tips jar on the counter' approach.

Some restaurants automatically include a tip in the bill, especially for large groups.  Many places also have a policy of splitting tips between all staff.

The only place you don't tip in the usual way is in a bar - if you're having really good service from someone behind the bar then you would say 'and one for yourself' when ordering - the bar staff will then add the value of a drink/an amount nominated by that venue to your bill when giving you your change.  In some places they'll actually have  a drink - depending on whether their manager minds :)

A coffee will cost between 60p (greasy spoon cafe) and £2 (posh coffee shop).  Cigarettes - I don't smoke but I think that a pack of 20 will be somewhere around £6-£7.  Remember also that smoking in public places, on buses, trains, in hotels etc is now against the law.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"Housing Benefit claimants, as well as JSA claimants are already ""discriminated"" against based on age. As an example:

* A 35 year old where I live is entitled to claim upto £375.01 a month in housing benefit [LHA].
* Anyone under that age, is restricted to a maximum claim of £260 per month housing benefit¹ [LHA].

The latter used to apply to under 25s up until the start of the year; It was called the Single Room Rent and has now been increased to cover those under the age of 35.

Meaning if you're a 30 year old [as an example] claiming £325 a month towards your rent, you're now short £65 per month.

As for JSA, that's also paid at different rates, dependant upon the age of the claimant:

* Over 25: £71 per week / £284 per month.
* Under 25: £56.25 per week / £225 per month.

The reason I mention it, is because look at the disadvantage under 25s will face when it comes to finding affordable housing at the moment:

* Someone under the age of 25 will have a maximum income, based on their benefit entitlement, of **£485** per month [in addition to benefits they don't technically ""see"" such as council tax, NHS help etc, etc.]

* Someone over the age of 25, but under the age of **35** will have a maximum income, based on their benefit entitlement, of **£544** per month.

* Someone over the age of 35 will have a maximum income, based on their benefit entitlement, of **£659.01** per month.

Add to all that other perceived issues, such as young[er] people being assumed to be bad with their money, the issue of some landlords preferring to rent to older ""more responsible"" tennants etc, etc, and young people are already up against it.

¹The rate is updated every April. At the start of the year claimants were entitled to £238.33. It's been increased to £260, to reflect the increase in market prices for single room accommodation in the area.

They can't move back in with their parents, because their apprentices are on the other sides of the country to their parents. What exactly are they meant to *do*?

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"Assuming the £2.60 per hour figure is correct.

Most apprenticeships I've seen advertised [and passed the details onto people who I think might benefit] typically run around 30hrs per week - that's £78 per week or £312 per month.

Your three bedroom example costs £400 per month. Let's give each person in this theoretical house share a bedroom each [unless you're planning on having two share a room, or someone sleep in the living room] - that amounts to £133.33 per month, or £33.33 per week.

This next bit I've had to base on where I live - the council tax band. The average three bedroom house where I live would fall into Band D, which amounts to £1,555 per year. That's £29.90 per week - or if we split the bill between three people - £9.96 per week / £39.84 per month

Utility payments - let's assume it's Electric only, so as to not have to include Gas. And on a Water meter, as it'll likely work out cheaper. I don't think £80 per month is an exaggeration - indeed it might be a super conservative estimate, but let's go with £80 per month - that's an additional £26.66 per person, per month.

So after rent, council tax¹, water rates and electricity, you're talking about an initial outlay of £199.83 - i.e. £200 per month.

That leaves £112 a month [assuming no tax, national insurance deductions]. Let's assume a bus pass, again I've had to base that off the bus passes in my area, but that's an additional £47 per month.

That leaves £65 per week. You're looking at an absolute minimum of £35 a month food [It's achievable, having spent the first six months of the year with a £40 a month food budget to test out a theory, but it's **far** from ideal].

That leaves £30 a month.

Clothes, discretionary entertainment costs [I purposely left off a tv licence from the utility bills], internet access, mobile phones, clothing

Yes, it's do-able, but honestly? I think that's a lot to ask of people who through the very fact they're eligible to do an apprenticeship, are going to be young, and not exactly used to dealing with those kinda things.

Back in the far mists of time when I was between 20 and 25 I could always find work doing something along the lines of cleaning skips until I got a ""proper"" job for a bit but these even these opportunities just aren't there in the present climate.  My generation had the collapse of Thatcherite economics which I guess meant meant nothing was handed to us on a plate and we faced a similar problem getting started in life but I see today's situation as much bleaker.

As mentioned [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/vi2og/cameron_to_announce_plans_to_axe_housing_benefit/c54u8gk), ""Discrimination"" based on a persons age is nothing new when it comes to the welfare system, though it's certainly been expanded recently [single room rate increased from under 25s to under 35s, the proposal to remove housing benefit entirely from under 25s etc, etc.]

As for the reason why? Cameron and the battle team at Conservative HQ aren't stupid. They know the demographics they need to appeal to, in order to secure a second term, ideally as a majority Government. Concurrently, they also know the demographics that likely *won't* vote for them.

When the latest housing benefit changes were introduced at the start of the year Cameron used three key arguments to justify it:

* We're in a recession - spending cuts are an unfortunate must.
* The Government spends in excess of £18.5BN on housing benefit already, a figure that needs to be cut.
* People who work often need to flat share / live with their parents until they've saved up enough money for a flat - why should people on welfare be given a property?

The last two are the key parts - the welfare bill appeals to Daily Mail readers and a surprisingly large number of tax payers who've never been dependant upon the state to provide for them.

The last part, appeals to [some] young professionals struggling to get onto the property ladder - they're working hard, yet ""Dole dossers"" are getting housing provided for them - for free - for doing ""nothing"".

You can likely use those key points, quantify 'em a bit, and get the ""reasoning"" behind why Cameron and Co. are contemplating this.

In his ""exclusive interview"" with the DM - ""Cameron to axe housing benefits for *feckless* under 25s as he declares war on welfare culture."" [That's right folks, ""feckless""] there's a comment about:

&gt;Scrapping most of the £1.8 billion in housing benefits paid to 380,000 under-25s, worth an average £90 a week, forcing them to support themselves or live with their parents.

Firstly, £90 a week for 380,000 claimants amounts to £1,778,400,000 - If our Government is so keen on saving money how about we not throw away £21,600,000 like it's small change?

Seriously though - ""...forcing them to support themselves...""

How, exactly, does the PM expect people to support themselves on JobSeekers Allowance? Under the age of 25 your maximum JSA entitlement is £225 per month.

As for moving back home / staying at home - I can't help but feel that shows a fascinating lack of understanding on the behalf of the PM, about life on welfare for some families.",0,1340539731,null,0,false,0,c54uvmr,t3_vi2og,t1_c54uvmr,t3_vi2og,null,1429217262,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,mikehaggard,null,null,"Unfortunately I've witnessed the exact same thing. We had a perfectly fine development team that produced a product our customers loved. 

Then one faithful day one of the managers pitched the idea that we should recruit in India, since they had so many great people there and tons of agencies that could get you any kind of developer with any kind of profile. So they contacted one of those outsourcing firms and we were send a bunch of resumes to approve.

The trouble started right there. We asked for Java developers experienced in some specific frameworks, but among the resumes were PHP developers, VisualBasic developers and some we were questioning were developers at all. Worse was that some resumes were in Word format and the history showed that on some they just changed the name of the candidate or were copy/pasting sections. The agency was an obvious scam, but the managers didn't want to hear about it and we had to proceed.

So (teleconference) interviews started and they were terrible. They would happily respond with ""yes"" to every question asked, but when being asked to write down some actual code on paper and show it to us they just sat there smiling, or pretending they didn't hear the question. Weeding out the absolute n00bs took months, and was a job the agency was supposed to be doing but they somehow tricked us into doing their work instead.

Part of our procedure is doing an assignment; a small programming task accompanied by a small essay that explained design choices that were made. Most of the code we received didn't even compile. It mostly made no sense at all, and several candidates that supposedly had no knowledge of each other handed in surprisingly similar code fragments. Not one of them had included the essay, despite us asking for it over and over again.

When developers overseeing the process told the managers flat out they could not okay the hire, they were bluntly replaced by ""less critical staff"". Oh, and somewhere in between the programming task got dumbed down a couple of times.

Eventually we ended up with 3 hires. Despite an enormous effort to get them up to speed, they kept making the most basic errors over and over again. When asked to close a DB connection in some code, they would painstakingly closed it exactly at the location we pointed out and didn't change it anywhere else. Overall the code they produced was an enormous mess; needlessly copy/pasting code all over the place, totally mixing up concerns, completely ignoring our code-conventions, writing logic in more than 100 lines of code, where it could rather easily be done in 10 at most, etc etc.

After repeatedly trying to get them on track, and blocking releases because of severe bugs, we were suddenly accused of being racists. Yes, racists... :| According to the managers, we were just making the stories up about the Indians being so terrible at coding. The simple and most logical explanation was that we were racists. Plain and simple.

Needless to say it went downhill from there. At some point we weren't allowed to hire locally anymore. ""Orders from higher management"" One day a local developer threw a fit because of the India situation and he was fired at the spot. The *very* next day a new Indian face appeared on the teleconference: ""Hi, I'm your new colleague. Happy to work with you guys"". :(

As more local developers left and more Indian developers were hired, bugs were piling up at a pace that had never been seen before and outages of our (online) product became more and more common place. Meanwhile, there were still meetings about ""further expansion of the Indian workforce"" and yes, they would take the current situation with sub-par quality into account. And every time the predictable outcome was that the Indian expansion would continue and that they were confident that with sufficient training and supervision the ""Indian Quality Problem"" could be solved.

My family and I volunteer our time to charities; my Mother is a Girl Guiding UK guider, and also volunteers her time for the local countryside park planting trees and general forest work. She is a member of the village hall commitee and helps raise funds for local events like the Jubilee, bonfire night, etc. My Father volunteers his time as an umpire and as a fundraiser for the (free to take part in, not posh) sports clubs. I help out at the RSPB, Butterfly Society and local wildlife organisations with general boring observation work and admin dullness. Right now all three of us have helped at the village fete, which is today, in our own way. I sat and decorated fairycakes/cupcakes ready to be sold, and helped cook a bunch of cakes for the fundraiser.

In my humble opinion, as someone who helps out in my local community, ***the Big Society is a piece of shit.***

Where is the money to fix the village halls that are crumbling? Who will pay for the child protection courses we have to do to work with children? How do we run charity organisations with no backing? It's all very well to have the volunteers with time and energy to help out, but if we have *no money* and no place to go, we can do jack shit. And I say this as someone who comes from a vaguely middle class rural area in Hampshire. What about the inner cities, where money is tighter? What do they have to do?

You also feel your work is undermined. All of us that volunteer our time and have done for years, we're made to feel it's not our work but Big Society's, and that on the back of what we do Cameron can smugly go, ""see? Big Society in action. Just as planned.""

You also run the risk of pushing out people. Volunteers who are able and willing are all well and good, but in somewhere like a museum where there should be paid professionals who have years of training to handle the artefacts/museum pieces instead of an overly enthusiastic volunteer? Nah. Not right. A volunteer who can dig ditches and help protect endangered scrublands from invasive species is all well and good, but you still need an expert on hand THAT DESERVES TO BE PAID to point out what's a weed and what's not.

Firstly, do you know what student housing you'll be staying in? Is it a hall of residence, or university managed accommodation?

In terms of expense, I have to warn you that St Andrews is not a cheap town. The cheapest place to buy groceries is Aldi, which is on Largo Road at its intersection with Tom Morris drive. For a wider range, you'll have to go to Morrisons, which is further out along Largo Road (but not far). The Tesco on Market Street in the center of town is a trap, it's obscenely expensive. By the end of my time in St Andrews I was ordering groceries online from Asda, which ended up saving me a bit of money.

Drinking, like everything else, is not always cheap in St Andrews. If you're a spirit-and-mixer kind of guy you'll usually be ok, but beer can be a bit steep. There are pubs all over the center of St Andrews, and there's the Union. The Union is always cheapest, but has an incredibly limited range of tap lagers and (AFAIK) no tap ales. Personally, I've found The Central and Aikmans Cellar to be the best for lagers (but not cheap), and The Whey Pat best for ales (still not cheap). If you're drinking beer in St Andrews, £3 per pint is basically the ballpark figure, sometimes more and sometimes less. The Vic is a popular drinking location, but if you go there DO NOT ORDER BEER. I paid £4.80 for a pint (really) once, and the lesson was learned.

You won't have a lot of time in a week, but that's ok, because this town is small! You can do a walking tour of the sights in one day, which should include the ruins of the cathedral, the ruins of the castle, both quads and East and West Sands (beaches). Beyond that, it's really about what you like and what you don't like. If you've never been to Scotland before, I recommend taking a day trip to Edinburgh if you can find time, as it's truly a beautiful city. If you like golf, play a round or two on our huge number of golf courses (5 at my last count).

Most of your links point to unproven allegations. Where you say there was no medical treatment whatsoever, the link says that there were some people who weren't medically trained, not all. My guess in this case those people were like me, an untrained volunteer trying to do their best. Early 90s Kolkata was a pretty shitty place to be, and resources for dealing with such a massively overpopulated and poverty stricken city were stretched thin.

I'm sick of people bagging on Mother Teresa who clearly don't know what the fuck they're talking about, especially because it comes from people like me (smartass left-wing atheists) and so you give my demographic a bad name.

true,victoriaj,uk,London,"I lived in Crewe for a year. It's fairly cheap to live there which is a plus, but it's the dullest place I have ever been in my life. 

I really don't want to be unfair, and I have to admit my time there wasn't particularly happy. I arrived miserable and not knowing anyone there. I asked some local people to tell me what the best thing about the town was and *everybody* said it was the station and started naming places you could get to by train.

Essentially the whole place is just where the train lines cross. All the major lines cross and they built the town around it. The economy was built around working on train, and later manufacturing cars, leading to a lot of unemployment later (and a lot of older people with hearing loss as an industrial illness). 

Having said all that the people are nice - I volunteered at their CAB when I was living there and I don't think I'd ever been in such a supportive atmosphere. The town may be dull but it really is very well placed for getting to other more interesting places. If you are driving you'll probably be fine. If not buses or trains to Stoke, trains to Chester (which is lovely), Birmingham (nice and big and busy), Manchester etc. are all easy enough. 

If the job pays well you could also consider Nantwich. For some reason Crewe and Nantwich are one council. Crewe is a very blah looking town, Nantwich is a pretty village more or less. With an unnatural number of pubs. It'll cost a lot more to live there, but with a car you could very easily travel to Crewe to work etc. Things kind of get split between the two places, including some council services, so if you live in one you will probably spend some time in the other. They are also home of the [""secret bunker"".](http://www.dabbersnantwich.me.uk/images/secret.jpg).

More unusual information - I once was inside the council buildings and a large plaque showed they've given the freedom of the town to a ship despite being a landlocked town. I once went to sign on and one of the women working at the JobCentre looked out the window and saw someone right outside with a knife and went out and just told him off. I always liked the swimming pool. There's a very nice cake shop in Nantwich and any event worth going to gets cakes from there (I mean people would think something was *seriously* wrong if you got them somewhere else). 

It's a great place to move to financially I would have thought. Add in the location and you can almost certainly forgive it for having no real personality of it's own. ",0,1340554558,null,0,false,0,c54wrtj,t3_visvt,t1_c54wrtj,t3_visvt,null,1429218181,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Being part of a bloc like the EU provides benefits which far outweigh the costs. In the UK people go on about sovereignty and all that, and being 'british', but no one is trying to take that away. The point is, at the end of the day does it matter who runs the place as long as its done in a democratic way which we can have influence over? I certainly never advocate a central european power but more of a loose federation where countries still retain a lot of power. You only have to look at the states to see that centralised power to that degree is not a good thing. It is important we retain a certain degree of control over a lot of issues, but there are certainly quite a few which centralisation could arguably be a benefit to.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"&gt;It's do-able. That's all that matters isn't it? As I understand it, benefits are supposed to be a safety net.

It's do-able if you know *how* to live on that kinda money. I can quite comfortably ""live"" - i.e. cost of meals - on £40 per month. That £40 per month buys me the raw ingredients to make three healthy meals a day, in addition to healthy snacks [Apples, Bananas, Blueberries etc, etc.]

During the winter, assuming I can get carrots relatively cheap, I can probably live on £35 per month.

So by that logic, surely the same should apply to other people, in particular those on benefits. I mean if someone who works can ""live"" on £35 / £40 per month, then surely those on benefits should be expected to do so also? At least if we subscribe to the notion that being in receipt of welfare grants you the bare minimums?

The problem with that, however, is that it assumes equal access both to raw ingredients, and to knowledge. I can live on that kinda money [I did it from January until June 1st] because I'm located smack bang between three different Aldi stores, a Lidl store, and because I know how to cook. I'm also exceptionally good with budgeting [hell, the amount of personal budgets I've written for people, I kinda have to be at this point.] and consequentially know how to prioritise my needs.

I'm loath to stereotype people, as I don't think it's helpful, but I've met and worked with sooo many people who only know life on welfare. Their parents, relatives, family friends etc, etc, have always claimed, and so they're ultimately a product of the Welfare system.

And again, without stereotyping, most of 'em aren't exactly well versed when it comes to healthy eating. Or budgeting.

For that you can blame either their upbringing, their schooling, or a combination of both.

So yes - if you've got access to cheap raw ingredients, and if you know how to prepare and cook those ingredients to make cheap [and healthy] meals - it's quite easy to live relatively cheap. Hell for £50 a month I can live like a King.

But if you don't know how to do it - and more importantly, you're not encouraged to learn how?

&gt;You're not on the streets or starving. You get a roof over your head, heating, water, clothes, food etc. Better than at least 1/2 the world population right there.

A 24 year old where I live can get - at most - **£485** per month [assuming full entitlement to JSA and full entitlement to the current maximum rate of single room rent LHA.]. That's £5820 per year, or **£2935.20 a year less** than they'd earn working 30hrs per week [£8755.20]. That assumes private accommodation - if they're fortunate enough to qualify for a local council property, they ""lose"" their housing [in that they don't get it paid to them; like council tax it's credited to their council account by the Government] and drop down to £225 per month / £56.25 per week.

Out of that £225 they'd be expected to make up any difference on their rent, and then absorb the costs you mention - heating, water, clothing etc, etc.

Again - yes, it's ""do able"". Of course you need to subtract from that figure the loan they'll be paying from their benefits to actually furnish the roof over their head, and to pay for the cooker needed to make such cheap and healthy food, but aye 'tis do-able.

The comment about being in a better position than 1/2 the world? True, but as this is supposed to be a first world country, it's not exactly relevant. AS a first world country our poorest and most vulnerable *should* be in a position of relative comfort.

&gt;I think if benefits are giving you a ""comfortable"" life, the system is broken. Because otherwise doesn't that take away a lot of the incentive for working? 

Is £225 a month comfortable? That's a little less than £7.40 per day to cover any short coming in your rent, all utility payments, food, clothing, travel etc, etc. Going back to that figure from the previous paragraph - if that same person worked 30hrs a week, they'd be earning £8755.20 per year - that works out to almost £24 per day - over 3x the amount you can get on JSA alone [which, if this proposal is passed, what future young people can expect.].

Do you honestly think the majority of young people who claim Welfare wouldn't rather be working 30hrs a week and getting 3x more money? Not to mention the possibility of developing skills and qualifications to help them progress on their chosen career path?

Let's assume that young person has now turned 35 and thus [under the current guidelines] is entitled to the ""full"" benefits package - i.e. full rate of LHA, JSA etc, etc.

They'd be ""pocketing"" £659.01 per month / £7908.12 per year. That's **still** £847.08 a year less than a 21 year old can earn, working 30hrs per week in a minimum wage job.

&gt;A three bedroom semi is pretty much the British average. I'm not so sure that someone on benefits should be living an ""average"" house.

A single person on welfare likely won't be able to afford a three bedroom property on their own.

&gt;Yes it sucks if you're on an apprenticeship and actually working. But I'm sure that is only a small % of people who are actually working for free. 

There are, I *think* [Again, don't have the figures to hand] around 450,000 people in the UK who're on apprenticeships. All of them will be under the age of 25. Now naturally not all of those people will be affected directly by this proposal, as plenty of them likely still live at home with relative, but if it affects even 1% of people who're on apprenticeships? That's 4,500 people. If those 4,500 people have to abandon their training, and are forced to sign-on?

You're looking at a bill of £253,125 for every week they do so; That's £1,012,500 per month, or £12,150,000 per year.

&gt;And I'm not saying that all people on benefits should be made to suffer, but we have to recognise that at some point you take away incentive to work.

To anyone with a modicum of common sense, or more importantly, a desire to make something of themselves, there's **no** incentive to sit on your arse all day, and sign on. I've already shown the maximum amount of welfare a person in receipt of work-related benefits can claim - it's less than a 17 year old who works 30hrs per week earns.

If a young person feels that it's more beneficial to sign-on and receive welfare, than to go out into the world and make the most of their potential? That's more of a societal failing in my opinion. Reducing their benefit entitlement won't fix that problem - what it *will* do is merely disenfranchise them and force others to suffer the consequences.

&gt;And as I said in my comment further up, the country is in debt and we need to cut spending. It's got to come from somewhere.

According to the Government, completely removing the entitlement to housing benefit for under 25 year olds would save £1,800,000,000 [£1.8BN]. The last report I read said the Government loses £35,000,000,000 [£35BN] a year through fraud and error. That's almost 20x the amount of money this proposal would save.

*They could start there.*

Super quick example - a young couple who both start working in their early 20s. Flash forward ten years, they've since had a child, split from each other, and both / one partner is out of work.

Surely they're entitled to welfare - the financial hangover from the split , the cost to raise the child etc, etc.

Are stores open much after christmas?

Yes, Liverpool One (a shopping complex) has shops that are open till late on a Thursday

What are the main attractions that are open after the 25th?

Everything really, Albert Dock is a good start, there is an eye there which gives you the whole view of Liverpool.  Tons of free museums too! Infact, I think nearly all of our museums are free.  

What are the best cities to visit around Liverpool?

Definitely Manchester, if you like history though Chester is the best.  Chester is around an hour on the train and it costs about 6 pound return from Central Station.  Chester is just a lovely city anyway.

Would you recommend public transit to get around the city?

Liverpool is a pretty small city with a small town center so you can pretty much walk to everywhere.  I would avoid using black cabs, if you need to get a taxi somewhere, look into private hire like Delta or Davy Liver Cabs.

What is the easiest method to get to neighbouring cities, Leicester, for example

Hahaha Leicester is an odd choice! Train is pretty much the only way to travel around England and because we're so small nothing really takes that much time.

I live in the city centre, I can give you tons of advice about anything else you need.  Oh, a really nice city is York too.  York and Chester are very historical.",0,1340562515,null,0,false,0,c54ycuz,t3_vj0av,t1_c54ycuz,t3_vj0av,null,1429218901,2,false,Liverpool,t5_2r21z,2

 The Albert dock has a lot of things to see and do. The art galleries and museums are also worth a visit, the walker art gallery is very well stocked and contains some amazing pieces. If you're into the whole arty stuff the beach has Anthony Gorley (the guy who did the angel of the north) statues all over which look very dramatic and surreal. 

The stores are open pretty much constantly in the christmas season but I think everything basically shuts down on actual christmas day. The buses and rail networks also generally don't run, or run on a limited service on christmas day but run late on christmas eve and boxing day.

Manchester, Chester, Port Sunlight, Southport if you fancy a seaside town, Even a day trip to the Lake District are pretty easy from liverpool. The rail networks are pretty great. You can even get to london within two hours on virgin trains (though book in advance if you plan to do this).

The city is relatively compact so walking is generally easiest, locals are always pretty good at directing you about. The bus and rail systems are also very comprehensive so that shouldn't be an issue.

My biggest bugbear at the moment is the altered and shortened opening times at my city's libraries. While I accept that savings must be made, the new opening times include a total of only 5 hours outside office hours, making the service very difficult for working people to access.

And Moffat said that Rory's badge was just a mistake last time around.. Apparently that was a lie? Or maybe he just found a use for it.

The badge of Rory said it was issued on 30/11/1990 (yet the year of Eleventh hour was 2010). Rory might be 20 in the Eleventh hour depending on his birthday and the date..(we know he's the same age as Amy). Perhaps this holds significance. Maybe Rory was planted there all along? Who knows.

Mrs Angelos pin is the same one that River wears in Big Bang. Mrs Angelo working for the Silence? Or some other secret organization together with River? Or is there another connection not yet clear... Moffat did say we would discover something new about River entirely. This is probably related.



Amy looks scared when she enters the TARDIS for the first time. But it's then never addressed; maybe she saw a silent?

I'm pretty sure the empty room where Zero hid has something to do with it too. I mean, an ordinary house and there's a room no one can see? Yeah right.


EDIT: To answer your question, it was the work of Zero, he attacked some of the staff and that's probably why it's a mess too.

EDIT2: I also have been wondering about a few lines from the Pandorica Opens. All the Doctor's enemies uniting...and all somehow work out he's behind the cracks in the universe. Everyone is aware of it long before the Doctor is...How? There's something else at play here and I can only conclude that it's another Timelord pulling strings from the shadows.

EDIT3: We know the exit is in a confrontation with the Weeping Angels, so I tried to find statues in Elevent Hour..When the Doctor tries to finds prisoner zero out in the open and sees Rory taking a picture, you can see statues if you pay attention. Maybe related, maybe coincidental. 

There has to be a connection between Eleventh hour and the Weeping Angels IMO, maybe it's the pin of Mrs Angelos (because River will be there too)...Maybe Rory gets sent back in time and gets his license in 1990...Maybe the ducks being sent back in time...Maybe something else.",0,1340564489,null,0,1340570792,0,c54yr7t,t3_villm,t1_c54yr7t,t3_villm,null,1429219173,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2
