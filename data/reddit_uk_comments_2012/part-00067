http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6211584.stm

You like playing with words, so here's some return fire.  And this time, I do hope you're offended.

You quoted wrongly by using the word ""best"" rather than ""solid"", as if there's actually only one proper way to portray The Doctor, which I never said.  A ""solid"" portrayal of The Doctor is completely fans' general choice, and the person most eligible for that award does happen to be Tennant now, who replaced Baker unofficially in 2006, and again (officially) in 2008, and finally in 2011, which are voted by- *yes*, you guessed it- **fans**.

You accuse me of *claiming* Tennant to be the best, obviously an attempt at dousing yourself in glory with this I-disagree-with-your-Tennant-opinion-that-I-completely-made-up fiasco you're trying to pull.  I never claimed such a thing.  

&gt;Tennant is the first Doctor to out-do Tom Baker in terms of **fans** and a **solid portrayal** of The Doctor.

Assuming you know what ""fans"" are and are now aware of how The Doctor's portrayal is *really* decided, you can rest at ease that I am not *claiming* Tennant (or Baker for that matter) to be the best, but instead, The Doctor with the most fan base- meaning he has the most ""solid"" portrayal of The Doctor, but not the ""best"".  No, *never* the ""best"".

I don't care how rude that sounded to you or how much ego you lost reading this, because I'm ***no*** Doctor.  I ***don't*** make people better.  I ***don't*** try to find ways to save everyone.

Van Gogh is well played and the episode has a lot of things that make Doctor Who great, like the emotions and creatures and gadgets and suspense. In fact when I attempt to get my girlfriend to watch it this is one of the episodes I want to use as an example.

I like The Shakespeare Code, mostly because I'm a big Shakespeare fan already. It's maybe not as good as Vincent in some ways but it's got some interesting moments that the Van Gogh episode doesn't have (pointing mostly at the bedlam scene). Not to cast a shadow over Matt Smith, who is great as the doctor, but something about listening to David Tennant vocalize his thought process is just interesting and fun to listen to.

But one of those two episodes is a great starter.

But I think it's quite limiting as if your in stoke bishop then you have a long walk into uni for a 9 am lecture and hence you have to breakfast relatively early. Also if you want to do something in town in you always feel like you have to go back and have dinner in halls first.. which can be a bit of a pain or treck! 

Also I didn't enjoy the really large canteen aspect of it - most days you'll have to queue up and then take a tray sit in a massive hall and try and coordinate so you go with 'your friends' also the menus tend to be very repetitive after 2 weeks you just be eating slight variations on the meals you've had previously which in lots of cases isn't that great. All in all the whole thing took the pleasure out of eating a bit for me! 

I don't know anybody really in self catered that has a strong dislike for it - especially if they like food! You'll be able to host your own little dinners etc and it can be all quite a lot of fun!

We can think of others which had much more on the negative side of the scales and far less on the positive.  Its sheer size means whatever the net influence, there a was a lot more of it though.  There's also the issue of good for whom?  It was clearly good for us - for a while, it's less clear it was good for those who ended up ensnared in it - both accidental and intentional extermination of indigenous peoples, slavery, seizure of resources, maladministration, unfair trade etc. all weigh heavily on the downside, and some continue to this day in other guises (neo-empire is hardly less exploitative, America and multinational corporations take note).

But it's also true that empires can do good both for the people who establish them and for others who fall under their sway, whether intentionally or unintentionally.  The Roman empire was both a blessing and a curse - both to Rome and its subject peoples.  Without Mohammed there would have been no Charlemagne, and without him no modern Europe and no US.  Whether those would have been good or bad outcomes is hard to know since we can't say what would have arisen in their place.  One can make similar claims for empires in India, China and Latin America.  Each of these civilizations definitely brought both unimaginable horror and varying degrees of development to the people they subjugated.  All of this may've been necessary in one way or another to bring us to the stage we are at, though who's to say we wouldn't have got here (or somewhere else equally interesting or better) without them?  History, unfortunately, isn't a strictly repeatable experiment - whatever the sloganeers say about learning from it lest we repeat it.  We can and we must learn from it, but we cannot change it nor implement parallel universes to pick the best of all possible worlds.  We can only go forwards with all the data we have and sincerely attempt to do better next time.

I am being gloomy.

And I admit we do have lots of good unique features. Here's a some tricky problems though.

Commercial sector growth requires investment. Clearly the banks are not going to invest in the kind of industry that's going to create wealth and jobs outside of finance. If we return to boom the market will return to focusing on property. We would need a different culture in banking to help domestic industry.

And yet we are relying on the private sector to expand. With what?

If we did return to boom we still have the problem of pay not keeping up with profits. Poor and middle class incomes have stagnated in the boom years. This is unsustainable and leads to household debt.

How can the economy expand when pay is stagnant in boom years?

Employment patterns have changed. Technology has made individuals far more productive. Successful businesses that employ people in the pay levels we need operate with fewer people than before. The creative industries that the UK is good at do not employ enough people. They just are not large employers.

But the demand for highly skilled people is beyond what the nation can provide. So we have too many under skilled people and import highly skilled people. Importing skills is always cheaper than training so there is a market disincentive to train. When we need to be focusing on training and getting higher skills we are discussing how we can hire and fire faster.

Who is going to pay for training?

I think we *could* have something like Leyland back. In an absurdity we are now a net exporter of cars. Managed not coincidentally by the German and Japanese. Clearly we have the engineering skills, the right kind of unions and right designers. You'll remember the last UK Rover management team?

It's a logarithmic growth, so a player being worth £1,000,000 doesn't necessarily make him twice as good as a £500,000 player.

It's more that the players who are worth crazy amounts (£10,000,000 plus) are valued at that because the have the qualities to decide big matches or win trophies, and are usually big name players who will sell a lot of shirts and make the club a lot of money in branding and advertising.

Also, the way I understand it is pretty much just supply and demand.

true,Syeknom,eng-Cornwall,"Cornwall (expatriate, living in Belgium)","I've never so much as had a drink in my 24 years and did feel rather ostracised in the first year or two of university. However, I quickly made my peace and stopping worrying about what other people thought of my sobriety. I also learned how to have a great time without drinks and would go out to party sober. Most people assume I'm drunk because of my raucous dancing.

It's lovely living in Belgium now where people are *very* heavy drinkers but don't binge. Consequently, there is next to none of the violence, hostility or twatishness that I see every time I'm back in the UK.

One thing that makes a big difference between the two countries is that drinking establishments open until very late here. I've frequently not come back from the pub until 8am, and between 4-6 is almost *de rigueur*. People don't even get drunk enough to get their dance on until 1-2ish. This means that folk here can drink slower over the course of the evening, both to enjoy the taste (they're drinking some pretty excellent beer here of course) and to pace themselves. My experience in England was people hammering shots down so that they could be wasted and ""enjoy"" their evening before they get kicked out of the bars at 11 and clubs at 2.

Also, beers here are much heavier and are more suited to enjoying. Shit like shots, vodka-redbull, alcopops and the like are not popular (or even really sold at all) here. They wouldn't enjoy that crap compared to a Westmalle/Palm/La Trappe/Orval/Karmeliet, etc.

I am the same, well it was the same until I got a different set of friends, not intentionally but it was just the way my life shifted. 

&gt;It bothers me that others think I'm dull or boring, just because I don't like to get completely shitfaced every weekend

Seriously who is the more boring, someone who HAS to have alcohol in excess to have a good time, or someone who is able to have a good time and fun without the need for alcohol? Really you have the better deal of it. If people think you are boring, then it is because they cannot think of any other way of having fun other than getting smashed. 

I went out Friday night and had enough to get quite squiffy but not out of my mind. I enjoyed it and felt tired but ok in the morning. I went out last night but didn't drink, purely out of choice and because I didn't feel like a drink as I had had enough the night before. I still enjoyed it just as much. 

If anyone suggests to you that you are someone lacking as a human being because you do not need to get smashed to have a good time, just remind them that looking after your liver is no bad thing and leave it at that.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The first point to cover is the precise definition of the queen, or the monarch, or even the monarchy. Obviously we are really talking about a network of advisors and family, so that will be my fuzzy definition for now. So 'the queen' is the head of the CoE and she gets to appoint officials. 'She' also gets to appoint lords 'with the advice of the prime minister'. 'She' also gets to appoint the 12(?) members that govern the Crown Estate. Charles is as much a part of the monarchy as Eliza, and we see he has a protected fiefdom in the Duchy of Cornwall. He is not obliged to pay income tax, and along with the immediate royal family, pays no inheritance tax. When push comes to shove the queen has the power to declare war, she has the power to overrule parliament and did so in 2004 forcing the inhabitants of the Chagos islands off their land to make way for a military base. Talking of the military, she has extremely close ties to the security forces and is probably privy to all manner of information that citizens never will be. She is also the head of state for many of the [world's tax havens](http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2012/06/03/born-to-rule-over-us/), which says something about the sort of social and financial organisations that flourish under her 'reign'.

The fact that she is a billionaire and the largest landowner in the world, having proxy control of much significant land in Britain are real powers. 'She' sits so close to parliament that 'she' has to have an influence greater than a regular citizen. We know for example that Charles has had many a quiet word in the ear of an official.

There is of course the power of the queen as an image which can be channelled for all manner of uses. I bet the government was loving the self indulgence of the jubilee to distract us from the financial ills of the present, and of course 'our troops' are fighting for 'queen and country'. I think it is really naive to see a hand waving apolitical grandma rather than a cynical marketing icon that is used to coerce acceptance of a social hierarchy.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;This graph shows the annual UK budget from 1979 to 2011 and it was clear that prior to 2008 the deficit wasn't that big.

What is screamingly obvious from that graph is that in 2005 when things on the economic front were going quite well there was a comparable deficit to the aftermath of Black Wednesday!  Of course if the next bad time was around the corner the deficit was going to have to become huge, because it would have to be extra spending on already crazy spending.  

You can't say that Clarke had similar spending.  His deficit in an economic downturn was the same as Labour's when everything was economically flowering.  You're taking it all out of context.

&gt;Bearing in mind we've nationalised banks now

Even the big one, the RBS Group which the taxpayer owns 84%, isn't nationalised.  We even agreed to scale back our effective vote at board level to 70% so it could remain a private bank.

&gt;we can sell them when they're of high value to reduce it further.

We are selling it, or at least we're in talks to do so.

&gt; It seems to me that everyone has ignored this point and thinks our current deficit is the result of too much spending on public services, no it's because of huge one-off payments to buy and nationalise huge banks.

It's a combination of a lot of things.  (i) There was no attempt made to honour Keynesian economics of balancing the books in times of prosperity.  None.  So whatever the cause of the next economic downturn the deficit was going to mushroom. (ii)  no public institution can go on receiving budgets which grow above inflation and population indefinitely, and the paperwork and redtape spend in the last decade had become colossal. (iii)  The debt, not the deficit, is approaching levels where it will no longer be serviceable.  (iv)  poor regulation.  (v)  Edinburgh, specifically the SNP, fucked up.  Alex Salmond was writing letters to RBS just before it blew up discussing and encouraging RBS to buyout Scandinavian banks.

I have never indulged in alcohol long term, at most I have been incapacitated two or three times in any given year, but those would have been accidental rather than a deliberate 'I'm gonna get shitfaced and have a good time and regret it all' mentality. I haven't consumed alcohol for two years, and I had never adopted the pub lifestyle anyway so it wasn't even a case having to make a conscious effort to 'quit'. I wasn't even much of a conscious effort towards any end. Should I ever get interested in food preserving and home brewing then I would happily consume that, but not out of indulgence.

It's interesting though to consider what drugs our government chooses to make legal. There is plenty of nicotine (both a stimulant and mild sedative depending on context), caffeine (an obvious stimulant) and alcohol (another sedative or, like the jubilee, an artificial source of merriment for the most part).

it had been so long since i'd been associated with the sport that TONS of things had changed about it. so i began watching MLS games on saturday afternoons because that's all i could find. one day i got a flyer in the mail from the cable company advertising Fox Soccer Channel. i purchased it immediately. 

after watching a few EPL matches i decided that i really wanted to choose a team to follow. the only 2 teams i'd ever heard of were ManU and Liverpool. i knew immediately that i didn't want to support either of those teams for that reason. i wanted to watch some teams play and pick a team based on footballing alone. at this point i knew nothing about history or rivalries or even who the current champs were. so as i watched for several weeks, it became clear to me that i was a Blue. they style of play was very similar to what i'd grown up with. the style of play was very similar to what i coached with my own team. and goddammit, that #8 Frank Lampard was such a badass. since then, i have been Blue through and through. 

maybe some consider me a bandwagon supporter since i came along in the Abramovich-era after we'd already won the league once, but i don't really care. Chelsea is MY club. Chelsea will ALWAYS be my club. Chelsea is OUR club!

true,phoeniks,cnty-uk,Shropshire,"lyrics -

I remember, I remember when my world was hardly grown

And the daughter of a dead dull king ascended to the throne

And though I was just a lad at school, I saw it all with scorn

The solemn, sacred emptiness, the monumental yawn 

And the slime exuding daily from the sycophantic slugs

And the Coronation ash trays and the Coronation mugs

And the rows of ermined mummies with their maggot-eaten brains

All the swarms of bloated blowflies the majestic turd sustains.

Droves of decorated duchesses like newly painted slums

Kneeling flunkeys, praying monkeys, loyal holes for royal crumbs

And the well-heeled sharks discreetly selling tickets for the show

Park Lane balconies with champagne at a thousand quid a throw.

Come and cheer the golden fairy Queen, forget your daily cares

For she radiates a glory that a grateful nation shares

And the pageantry, the panoply, the sanctified decay -

But I knew the hour was coming that would sweep it all away.

Now time has me in a corner and I'm moth-eared from the fray

But Her Majesty is reigning still today.

 
With a glass cage around her and an absence in her eyes

And though regiments surround her, they can't take her by surprise

She's as poised as a picture, she's a sight for all to see

With a glass cage around her on her Silver Jubilee

with a glass cage around her she feels free.


 
I remember 1956, division East and West

British paratroops in Suez, Russian tanks in Budapest

And the peaceful marchers singing for the dream that must come true

Of a world freed from the nightmare we've since grown accustomed to

And the Cuban missile crisis with the rumours flying round

That the Queen was in her secret bomb-proof palace underground

And the violence exploding when anger made a stand

For a peasant people burning in a torn and tortured land.

And the Monarch walked her corgis behind the palace wall

Never once betraying what she felt or if she felt at all.

While her husband shot his mouth off like a walking blunderbuss

She gave birth to royal children with the minimum of fuss

Maintained her waxwork dignity as she trod the royal dance

Fulfilled her royal functions in a kind of royal trance

Balmoral, Ascot, Sandringham, the ship launching routine,

Palace banquets, garden parties ever smiling and serene

Unique symbol, model woman, never seeing, always seen

so we watched her as she played at being Queen.


 
With a glass cage around her etc.
 
She seems so commonplace a woman in her fuddy-duddy hats

But she doesn't stand in bus queues or live in high-rise flats

And she doesn't ride the rush hour or cycle down the Strand

And she doesn't play maraccas in the Ivy Benson band.

And she doesn't shop for bargains, she's never on the dole

And if she does the football pools she doesn't tell a soul.

And she never used to bother with the Inland Revenue

Though she's royally rewarded for the things she doesn't do

With palaces and properties and to keep her in good cheer

A working wage of 36.7 million pounds a year

A royal train, a royal plane, a costly royal yacht

And lucrative investments in only God knows what.

Oh the magic of the monarchy, the mystery sublime

Growing gracefully and effortlessly richer all the time.

She's the rock of hope and glory in the quicksand of despair

For although the pound may tumble, although panic fills the air

Although governments may crumble and the cupboard's nearly bare

Though the stairs begin to rattle and the rats begin to stare

She enfolds in mystic unity her subjects everywhere

And we know we're safe from harm while Nanny's there.

I think for many it does change when you get older or have kids. 

As a person that has lived in Denmark and other countries you are right that your view is more along the lines of a night out in Denmark, a night out will start out with everyone meeting at a house, chatting, drinking and getting ready. This is when most of the dinking happens (it is cheapest this way) then you go out and may have 3-4 drinks over the course of the night, A night out can be from 9pm till 5am. This means that you cannot get very drunk before going out and going out and drinking 20 pints just does not happen (it will cost too much). 

Night outs are more relaxed (and cost a lot more) and I never saw a fight or anyone incapable of looking after themselves  in DK. 

Now I am older (40) I still go out for a drink but never to the town or city centre due to the fallout from binge drinking, I do consider we have an unhealthy attitude to alcohol in this country and the fact is that, as a nation, it has extraordinary cost. 

The lack of an alternative is the largest worry for myself, when meeting someone socially in the UK (when you just want to sit and chat)  of an evening home or the pub are the only alternatives that spring to mind ( Yes, I know some coffee shops open late but not in the town I live in).

true,Gallifrasian,tennant,Tennant,"&gt;rather than just clarifying what you meant in the first place, you're continuing this as an argument over how to interpret your first comment.

A very nice hypocritical response, as expected of a dick like yourself trying to save face.  I happen to, in fact, clarify what I said prior to the unnecessarily long explanation you obviously needed with just a few simple words and quotes.  You still stand by your interpretation, which I find amusing, especially after the first part of your comment quoted above.

&gt;However, **I stand by my interpretation of your original statement**, given that I only had the words you actually used, not your intent. **I understand now what you meant.**

Nice.  Makes sense.  Lots.  You obviously understood my words when I told you that there's no such thing as a *best* Doctor.  I gave you the opportunity to accept and understand it, yet you chose to reply anyway with a *dick* comment.  Yeah, it's a dick comment, and no one will agree with you that it wasn't a *dickish* attempt to prove an invalid point.  Which leads to;

&gt;As someone who happens to NOT be you, I had only the words you actually used in the first place.

Again, I had given you more than enough to understand my intent in my second post.  Still, you argue a tipless point.

&gt;I wasn't trying to create an argument out of nothing.

Like many of your uninteresting and repetitive statements, this is yet another lie;  

&gt;I like how you're just claiming Tennant had the ""best portrayal of The Doctor"" as though it's undisputed fact. The way I see it, it's just the opposite. He was too normal; too human. Though, to be fair, that likely contributed to his popularity, since that made him easier to relate to than Eccleston and Smith, at least.

You write something like *that* and expect not to get bashed over it?  Get over yourself.  Of course you wanted to argue about this.  You can pretend you're on some morally high pedestal all you want.  It doesn't change the fact that you *wanted* to win and now you *want* to save face.

true,dlink,lfc99,,"**Brendan Rodgers has spoken of his intention to play attacking football at Anfield and entertain the Kop.**

After seeing his Swansea team applauded off the pitch for their performance at Anfield last November, he witnessed at close hand just what a unique bunch of supporters Liverpool have.

The new boss was reserve team manager at Stamford Bridge when Liverpool beat Chelsea in the Champions League semi-final, and he insists the special atmosphere of Anfield, matched by an attacking team can intimidate opponents.

Recalling the 2005 semi-final, Rodgers said: ""The (Chelsea) players said they had never experienced support like that.

""That was ultimately what won the game. I want to use the incredible support to make coming to Anfield the longest 90 minutes of an opponent's life.

""I want to see great attacking football with creativity and imagination, with relentless passing of the ball.

""I know what it's like because I had a team like that at Swansea. That was with a terrific group of players. When people came to Swansea, it was probably the longest 90 minutes in their life. So after 10 minutes, when they hadn't had a touch of the ball, they are looking at the clock and seeing only 10 minutes had gone. It's a long afternoon.""

Rodgers knows the expectations at Anfield are different to those at the Liberty Stadium, but he has a strong mental approach and is eager to give the supporters something to shout about.

""When you come to a club like this one, the shirt weighs much heavier than any other shirt,"" he said.

""The weight of expectation is phenomenal. My job next season is to try and lift some of that weight off the shirt. I'll take the pressure.

""The players can just go and concentrate on performing and if you don't do that you'll get the result eight or nine times out of 10 because of your talent.

""The reality is that this is a club where I need to align the playing group with the supporters. There is an imbalance at the minute.

""You've got some of the world's best supporters here and the playing group is not quite at that level yet. What excites me is the motivation to get that level back up again and that is why I came.""

The pass and move philosophy which has become Liverpool's trademark is what Rodgers wants to bring to the pitch on a regular basis and he insists it is important to keep those traditions.

He added: ""I think every player will tell you they would love to play that way. The question is, does every player want to work that way?

""For me, a lot of our game is based on passing. Our game at Swansea was talked about a lot and lauded. What people didn't recognise is that to have the ball for 60-70 per cent of the game you have to get it back, very, very quickly.

""So our transition in the game and positioning to get the ball back became very good and that allowed us to beat Manchester City, to beat Arsenal, should have beaten Chelsea and to beat Liverpool.

""It's not starting from scratch but tweaking. I don't think it is a total rebuild.

""Obviously I have a philosophy in terms of where I want to get to but that won't happen on the first day. What we will need to do is make a number of adjustments and bring in players for key positions that will allow us to play that way.

""You can't come to Liverpool and play a direct game of football, lumping-it style.

If I were in the front office, I would be extending his contract and telling him he is moving to a central striker role (behind Torres of course). He has enormous potential as we saw in flashes last season, and the selfishness will dissipate as he gets regular playing time.

I'm of the opinion that he was so selfish because he did not see himself getting many opportunities with the first team, so he had to take his chances and score in order to show his value to the manager. You can't really fault him because it worked (at least under AVB), and he got a lot of playing time last season.

Edit: Also, he was playing on the wing where he needed to be more of a provider, but that is just not his position. All strikers have a selfish streak. Just look at Drogba-- I can't count the number of times I wanted to throw my TV out the window because of something dumb and selfish that Drogs did on the pitch, but he could not have scored some of his most amazing and timely goals without that bit of selfishness in front of goal.

After walking around for a while, we said fuck it, and hopped on the tube to Stamford Bridge, to at least see what the atmosphere was like. Once down there, we decided that we had to get tickets, because we had to go to this game. 

We found some old guy scalping tickets, followed him into some sketchy alley and handed over our £200(!!), and hoped to god our tickets worked. We got into the stadium, found our seats, and watched them beat Man City 2-1. I bought a Lampard kit afterwards, to commemorate his PK :) 

Easily the best sporting event I've ever been to in person, even though I go to a major, BCS college. Ever since then, I've tried to watch as many Chelsea games as possible, but it really peaked when I watched their games against Barca.

Not legal. The contract may state that his tenancy will be terminated but that does not mean the same thing. It means that he would be in breach of Section 8 under Ground 8 as I said above. That then allows you to start proceedings for an eviction order, not just throw his stuff out.

&gt;  It's only a 6 month contract anyway, so the routes you mention are not going to be worth it. I doubt anyone is going to be arrested over a civil matter as well

Except that when you illegally evict him which it appears that you're intending to do, it becomes a CRIMINAL matter and YOU are the criminal. Actually it might end up being your father if he is the landlord named on the tenancy, regardless of the fact it is you who does it.

&gt;  I'm leaving for two weeks in a few days and not happy to have this guy have access to the place. I'll store his stuff in the basement until the end of his contract, which is another 4 months.

You cannot legally enter his room. To do so is breaking and entering and trespass. Neither can you change the locks.

I suggest you grow the fuck up and start acting like an adult instead of the child you clearly are.

I am seriously starting to hope he's a ""professional tenant"". You've probably never heard of them but they are people who do like he has done then wait for a dickhead like you to do what you're planning and then they sue for £1000s and move on to the next mug.

The point is not if the terrorist is culpable or not, that is not a point of contention, but rather would you protect those who are willingly going to a terrorist attack target, or those who surround it who have no culpability whatsoever but will be placed in danger - not because of the attack - but by the methods used to defend against such an attack?

true,[deleted],null,null,"Woah mate! I like the calling me creationist at the end, made me laugh. But on the second point I would say we are both not quite right. Where does the line come between someone being a different race and just having a different genetic mix? It's a continuous spectrum, my genetic make up is very close to my mum but not quite the same. Am I a different race from her? How much different do I have to be from someone to be considered a different race. It is quite incorrect to claim 100% that race is supported by ""mountains of empirical evidence"", please see [Witherspoon et al. 2007](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genetic_clustering). Race is a highly contested subject in biological circles, please don't make wild claims, then support them by using the word ""evidence"" and calling me a creationist. I do, however, agree with you that I myself should not have been so abrupt. What I should have said was, ""There is not enough evidence to support the idea of different races.""

I can't see what's wrong with my first point, as you didn't explain what you had a problem with. I will explain further though. If we look at the etymology of the word ""racism"" it has two parts ""race"" and ""ism"". ""Race"" meaning a subset of a species and ""ism"" meaning and ideology. So all together it means ""Race ideology"", the belief that races exist and that they are different to yourself. Could you explain what you find wrong with what I said?

true,_r00t_,null,null,"&gt;Indeed, Race is all but defunct as a scientific concept. 94% of the genetic differences between people are regardless of 'race'; you can have someone much more genetically similar who is of a different 'race'.

See argument 2:


**Race Denial** 

Argument 1: **The Fallacy of Genetic Ignorance**. 

Race cannot be real because there is no single gene or set of genes unique to any one group.

Answer: The idea that a race must possess a gene or set of genes unique to a race is a misconception. Racial differences are a result of PATTERNS of differences in gene frequencies.

Argument 2: **The Fallacy of Race Trivialization**

There are population differences both physical and genetic, but they are of no importance and are not large enough to qualify as racial differences. 

Answer: The tiny amount of genetic variation between humans and chimpanzees is also not enough to account for physical differences between the two species. That is because the way the genes are EXPRESSED is more important than the amount of genetic difference. There is a significant difference in human chimp gene expression and patterns, not the genes themselves. Small alterations in a single gene, FOX2P, is probably the main reason humans are capable of speech and chimps are not. Small changes have ENORMOUS consequences. 
A 2% difference in human and chimp genome produces such extraordinary physical and mental differences, small differences in Races also have important results.


Argument 3: **The Continuum Fallacy**

There is a continuous variation in human differences, a gradual change in skin color and we can't tell where the dark and light races become differentiated. 

Answer: If there were no racial continuum there would be no intermediate forms, no interbreeding between races and humanity would be divided into species not races.  Just because we have an admixture of red and yellow that produces the color orange does not mean red and yellow do not exist. Continuum proves that there are indeed different races, not that race does not exist.

Argument 4: **The Fallacy of Arbitrary Classification**

The typological methods of racial identification and classification based on morphological traits or phenotype is arbitrary. 

Answer: Racial classifications are not arbitrary. They are consistent with the geographic populations of humanity as they really exist and are an observable and verifiable reality. Race classification is no more ""arbitrary"" than subspecies classification within any other species.

Argument 5: **Racial Re-Definition** 

Re-defining the definition of race to define it out of existence. For example claiming all humans are one race, purposefully confusing race with species.

Answer: Purposeful lies and distortion of the truth for political reasons, no matter how well intentioned, is unscientific and harmful. An accurate definition of race is one that describes it as it is. If race exists by the standards defined and does not in the new definition, the new definition is wrong. Because the new definition itself, does not exist. Denying a reality by creating a new definition under which that reality does not exist is not scientific but politically motivated.


Argument 6: **The Fallacy of Authority.**

Attempt to convince people that what they see with their own eyes is not real, by getting help from supposed experts and authorities presumed to have superior knowledge of the subject. 

Answer: Racial denial by these supposed experts is intellectually dishonest. Scientist still study race at the genetic level, they simply replace RACE with words such as POPULATION in order to appease today’s politically correct climate.

Argument 7: **The Fallacy of Scientific Obsolescence** 

Race is based on a false, outdated and obsolete concept of science from a previous, “colonial” era. 

Answer: There have been false beliefs in every branch of science; this does not make the science itself obsolete or false. As for the study of race, scientists use state of the art techniques such as Magnetic Resonance Imagery (MRI). The bias by those who choose to misrepresent the recent research on race to justify a social agenda they want to promote.


Argument 8: **The Social-Political Construct Fallacy**.

Race is a social or political construct that has no basis in biological or genetic reality. 

Answer: This argument collapses on itself when confronted with the most basic of evidence of racial reality. The irony is that the idea of race not being real is a Social Construct invented in the past several decades with purposeful political intent.

Argument 9: **The One Sided Fallacy**

Given that most racial denial arguments are fallacies that are easily refuted; an environment of de-facto censorship is required, in which arguments of racial denial are stated as fact with no counter argument allowed. Just because you believe what the majority believes is correct does not make it true, it just makes the majority of you wrong. No matter how many names you call the opposition or Pseudo-Intellectual heirs you may assume. The truth is, race deniers care more about being liked, fitting in, and achieving a political social agenda, than in being intellectually honest and correct.


Argument 10: **The Fallacy of Argument Begging.**

Race has to be denied in order to end racism. Those who believe in the reality of race are perpetuating and abetting racism. 

Answer: They have convinced themselves that race promotes racism. So they push the politically correct agenda that human races are not biologically real, no matter what the evidence. We therefore are dealing with politically motivated censorship rather than science.

Argument 11: **Intimidation**

Make the opponent retreat before a verbal onslaught of insults, threats and accusations without substantive arguments being made.

But most important thing is that they cared! And they still do.

Not enough water under the bridge since H&amp;G (I'm sure you can find a way to empathize through a different context).

true,doonjoot,null,null,"But that's nonsense.

Look, think it through. If a terrorist cell exists with the wherewithal and the desire to perform some sort of aerial attack against a large stadium type target (which is really the only justification for these measures), then only two courses of action make sense.

1) Immediately arrest the terrorists. In which case, you have no need for missiles, but lets assume that for operational reasons you can't do this.

2) Place missile batteries defending every major target into which a  plane can be flown.

If you only place missiles defending one set of stadiums for a six week period, then the only logical conclusions to be drawn is that the terrorists in question either give up when they can't attack their first choice, or that for some reason they are only capable of mounting an attack between August and September. These conclusions are ridiculous beyond words.

A third possibility is that this over hyped politically motivated posturing and fear mongering. This I find less difficult to believe.

Anyway, it's all a moot point. Neither you nor I will ever see the supposed intelligence that motivated this decision. So really, your position for or against comes down to a simple question; Do you trust the word of the intelligence services, the government and the MOD.

I don't.

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"It's not so much ""take your business elsewhere"" - we're fans, not consumers, so it's never going to be the same. And you're right about fans being clued in more often than the media - just look at how much of the media criticised Rovers fans this season, when they had it right all along. And when I said supporters booing, I didn't mean that to be all that SOS did - I know how important they were, especially in making it clear to banks that refinancing H&amp;G would be an awful idea (see my OP).

And yeah, H&amp;G have left scars on more than just the playing squad and our finances - I guess I'm more trusting of FSG than plenty of fans, fair enough. But seriously, **how did SOS want to be involved?** Kenny was gone less than a week when they sent this out. Two weeks to replace a manager is not a significant amount of time. You can raise issues with the fact that the other positions, namely whichever people are replacing Comolli, could have been in place by now, and that's valid. But is two weeks to replace a manager too long now?

And if they want a channel of communication *with the club*, why release a public statement rather than just privately contact the club, and only put out a statement when they had a response from the club? Equally, it's hard to have it both ways - we applaud it when the club do things The Liverpool Way behind closed doors, but then we want to know what's going on as well. 

Maybe the headless chickens thing was harsh; SOS deserve more respect for what they did for the club.

That isn't what I said, read again. Try and get out of the twisting comments to fit mindset. 

""People choose to read comments in a particular light because it fits their **own** agenda""

&gt;How else would you describe saying that a person who has just been quite badly bullied should have thicker skin? If she is blameless, her behaviour is irrelevant.

The word blame has only been introduced by you and the le_narwhal_king. My post mentions nothing about blame, it is an interpretation given to a comment because people are too lazy to read what is there. Far easier to suggest I am blaming the woman. 

My comment again: 

""No one should put up with or tolerate racism""

Ok is that bit clear enough? 

""but to work in immigration, or indeed any part of the airport industry that deals with the public, you need a much thicker skin than that. Bursting into tears seems a little odd for an immigration official.""

Bursting into tears is a little odd for an immigration official, considering the crap they have to put up with from passengers. The ones I know certainly don't take it personally, and deal with abuse through the proper channels, as this woman did. 

That opinion has nothing to do with whether she should have been abused or not, it is obvious she should not have been. Neither should anyone else. It is  not apportioning blame on her, or anyone else apart from the nutter businessman. 

And, if there was any further doubt, in the same comment I also said:

&gt;Huh? I only know of one disorder IED that would fit with that picture, but it is a psychological disorder not neurological. And it is usually part of a bigger pattern of mental health issues.

That would imply I am suspicious of the reasoning they gave in court for his outburst and tried to excuse it.  

And if anyone had bothered reading my subsequent comments ( in the same thread) and exchanges they would also see more comments where blame was not apportioned to the woman involved whatsoever. But people are lazy and it seems to be easier for them to mold a comment into whatever interpretation they fancy rather than reading what is there.

Hartnell was alright, but I'm used to seeing quirky/eccentric Doctors so he felt a bit odd for me.  He did have his moments, though (""I made some cocoa and got engaged!"").

I'm still in the middle of Pertwee so I don't have much of an opinion on him, but so far he seems like a pretty good Doctor.  If you have any recommended serials for these earlier Doctors that are on DailyMotion, please let me know and I'll check them out.

2. They will have package deals but i imagine them to be overpriced and at 5 star hotels etc but alas it's your honeymoon so go wild.

3. Pretty sure there is no other way to getting tickets other than through the official site. The only other way would be ticket touting sites (overpriced).

I still like the idea that it's actually the Timelords. 'Who else' could refer to multiple people or even a species. The Timelords were a danger to time itself at the end of their existence, which would explain the cloister bell. The Doctor had been running from his people ever since he stole the TARDIS. The Doctor locked them in a timelock and condemned them to a faith even worse than death itself. And then he was confronted with them once more right before he regenerated into 11.

Furthermore, the Medusa Cascade and the Doctor seem to be linked in a big manner. His name is supposed to be hidden there. He once closed a rift there singlehandedly (according to the Master). The Daleks and Davros chose the Medusa Cascade as a location to hide from the Doctor. What if the Timelock is linked to the Doctor's name? And what if that Timelock is undone once his name is said?

true,Variola13,null,null,"&gt;You place too much emphasis on logic and not enough on rhetoric.

The rhetoric that can be interpreted in any way someone chooses it seems.  For instance, a logically similar comment could be ""that woman should not have been sexually assaulted, but do you not think she should have worn a shorter dress?

No that is logically dissimilar, in every way. For a start, the short dress is implicated in being a factor that caused a man to rape her. There is nothing that that woman said or did that caused the man to abuse her, her crying was a result of his tirade of abuse, it didn't cause it. 

My comment was one of genuine surprise that an immigration officer should be in tears over it, mainly because they have a tough job and put up with a lot of crap. I did actually wonder if the article had misreported her as an immigration officer. Her reaction to it was quite understandable, but it did surprise me.  

&gt;This is perhaps logically sound in and of itself, but in practice it is a rhetorical sleight of hand to extend blame to the woman.

In terms of being lgically sound it isn't and anyone who would say that, I agree would be trying to imply some blame on the woman. When in fact women should be able o wear what they like without being raped. But to extent that argument, if I had said ""That woman should not have been abused, but do you think she should not have worn a headscarf to indicate she was Muslim?"" Or, "" That woman should have been been abused, but do you really think a Muslim lady should be an immigration officer?"" then your rhetoric and logic would stand. But the fact remains I didn't say that, neither did I apportion blame in any of my subsequent posts. 

&gt;Similarly my use of that analogy is logically fair, but rhetorically a needlessly provocative and unpleasant thing to do, because I am associating your quite mild comment with rape.

Provocative and unpleasant yes, but I can understand you are demonstrating a point, but you are still associating her crying, which happened *after* the abuse with somehow causing the abuse itself, that is not something I am doing.

Which most likely would be following either the US, French or perhaps German model. None of these have worked as effectively as ours.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The revenue which they would get from the Royal Estates they hand over to the government so for every pound they receive from the state they effectively bring in five.  That's just for starters.

Then there's the tourist thing - that's pretty self explanatory.  You might think it's a bit strange people having a fascination with the Royals but the fact remains that they do.  You only have to go as far back as the Royal Wedding to see this.  It wasn't just Commonwealth countries that broadcast it.  It's one thing having empty palaces that hark back to a time gone by.  It's another thing to have a working palace.  If Paris Hilton can make money just from being famous you can rest assured a whole Royal Family, with far greater standing, can raise a helluva lot more for an entire country on celebrity alone.

You then have to consider what having a continual family for the head of state achieves diplomatically.  The same Queen has met US presidents all the way back to black and white telly.  There's continuation and stability there, and whilst some countries could work just as well with the UK without this foundation and history, in some countries, some cultures, it is greatly admired, even revered.  Like him or not having a connected grease-weasel like Prince Andrew as an international trade and investment envoy opens a lot of doors.

Then we should understand why any charity would crawl over broken glass to have a Royal representative, why any brand would love to have a Royal seal of approval.  It sells and brings in attention.  By virtue of there eminent celebrity they're an advertiser's wet dream, and all they have to do is turn up and say a few words.  Everybody knows the panda logo of the WWF; you can thank Prince Philip and Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands for that.  They stepped in when conservation wasn't nearly as popular and worked like zealots to fill its coffers, forming the 1001 Club.  It's too much to say that Prince Philip fathered conservation, that would be silly, but he damn well made it prominent a decade in advance.

Even then we're still not finished.  Everybody considered Charles a loon when he first started talking about organic farming and opening up another aspect of farming more in tune with nature, where people would actually willingly pay more for food which in turn would revolutionise small farms making them again profitable.  They openly mocked him for it.  He went ahead anyway and ran his farm at a loss which he covered.  It started to gather interest, and whilst other farmers couldn't charge the prices Charles could a market for Organic farming was established.  In time Charles would see his farm turn a profit; he of course gave all his profits not going back into the farm to charity.

They make an awful lot of money for the country and not a single other head of state in any country even remotely holds a candle to what the Royals cost and what they return.  You don't have to like them; but they're easily worth much more than the £40million they cost the UK.  That's how much the Royals cost the UK; going back to the first point, £200million that's how much they voluntarily give to the Government each year from the Royal Estates.",0,1338822937,null,0,1338823493,0,c4w3qiq,t3_ujzt3,t1_c4w3qiq,t1_c4w3agn,null,1429065277,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

They might make more money as they'd be opened up for the public more making them more attractive tourist attractions. The queen may have met many presidents but in how many of these meeting did formal discussion of trade and industry link ups take place. She may give us stability in a semi-political way, but not in the economic sense. I agree with you about Prince Andrew though, ironically he might be the one who actually earns the UK the most money with some of those dodgy deals with dictators, on the other hand they'd have probably bought our arms anyway provided the deal was right.

The charity aspect while admirable, arguably has the ulterior motive of keeping themselves relevant and popular so that we continue to keep them up, not that should detract from the actual work they've done. Prince Philip's contribution to the WWF is isn't relevant to the question here as it was over 40 years ago, and the WWF aren't going to go under if the royals were to be deposed next week. Also if we were to lose the royals I doubt that charities such as the Prince's Trust would be abolished with them, they would continue to run, although probably with a lower profile, which would be a shame.

You also talk of how their profile is used for promoting good causes, a counter to this would be how they promote, well bad causes. Prince Andrew and some of his dodgy deals would be one case, but the biggest one has to be Harry serving in Afghanistan. This was a PR move to use the royal's perceived popularity and influence shift people's opinion on a war, which is now almost universally seen as against national interest and of great cost to the country, both in human terms and economic.

&gt; not a single other head of state in any country even remotely holds a candle to what the Royals cost and what they return.

If a dog attacks someone then the recorded owner is automatically charged with assault/GHB/manslaughter (depending on what happens). There also needs to be a process for ownership transfers. As other people have noted, ultimately it is the way the owners raise their dogs that is the problem, so there needs to be a way to link the dog to the owner if there is an attack. This scheme could be for all dogs, or just for certain breeds. If your dog isn't registered, then it's immediately taken away, accessed to see if it's dangerous and you don't get it back until you pay for it to be registered + a fine for not doing so, otherwise it's destroyed.

Again, it's very simple to do this. All the tech already exists, it just needs to be brought together, and funding could be a mix of taxation and dog license fees, with some form of discount for the initial roll out period and a grace period of a year to register the dog during the same.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Most of these points, while good, are fairly irrelevant to the question I asked. 

They're all incredibly pertinent to the wealth and money they bring in.

&gt;The royal estate would make money whether we had a sitting monarch or not.

We don't *own* the estates.  It is still private property and would remain so.  A legal entity in its own right.  Instead of giving *all* the revenue the estates make the state would instead only be able to claim the same in taxation that it would anybody else, so, after all expenses, approximately half.  The state would be immediately *worse* off.

&gt;They might make more money as they'd be opened up for the public more making them more attractive tourist attractions. 

They're very much working estates now with public access.  You're assuming that the state would be able to seize these lands back.  'The Crown' is very much a legal entity in its own right.

&gt;The queen may have met many presidents but in how many of these meeting did formal discussion of trade and industry link ups take place.

Are you kidding me?  The family is constantly going on trade and business meetings on behalf of the UK, and their presence largely puts the inter-governmental quibblings of the day to one side.

&gt; I agree with you about Prince Andrew though, ironically he might be the one who actually earns the UK the most money with some of those dodgy deals with dictators, on the other hand they'd have probably bought our arms anyway provided the deal was right.

No Queeny; no Prince Andrew, and make no mistake titles open doors.  It's far from limited to arms deals too.

&gt;The charity aspect while admirable, arguably has the ulterior motive of keeping themselves relevant and popular so that we continue to keep them up, not that should detract from the actual work they've done.

Again, you can't be serious.  They're popular with charities because they raise awareness and they're phenomenal at raising money.  That money not only comes from rich private UK bank accounts but from fat accounts on the international stage, and that money then goes into either a British charity or an international charity that serves British interests if only to raise Britain's standing making for closer relations, and, yes, trade.

&gt;Prince Philip's contribution to the WWF is isn't relevant to the question here as it was over 40 years ago,

What's time got to do with it?  Not only was it not only 40 years ago, the guy's 90 years old.  Only fair in asking what Philip has done as a Royal that you look at when he was most active.  As for irrelevant it set up Britain's standing, it has opened up new revenue streams at home and overseas, it has helped other countries to make money and improved relations.  Conservation and environmentalism is big business and he's very much played his part as a catalyst.

&gt;You also talk of how their profile is used for promoting good causes, a counter to this would be how they promote, well bad causes. Prince Andrew and some of his dodgy deals would be one case, but the biggest one has to be Harry serving in Afghanistan.

Now that is subjective and off point.  We're talking in terms of finance and expense.  Can celebrity in its own right generate wealth?  If so we have some of the biggest celebrities working for the state.  It is no more convoluted than that.

&gt;This was a PR move to use the royal's perceived popularity and influence shift people's opinion on a war,

That's just conspiratorial mumbo-jumbo.  They actively tried to talk Harry out of it, and they had to jump through all sorts of security  hoops and loops to allow him to go.  As if Harry turning up in Afghanistan is going to swing public opinion one way or another about a war.

&gt;This incredibly biased and pretty wrong if consider the economic benefits the some of the emirs of the gulf states have done for their countries.

Name one emir that has done anything close as to what the Queen has achieved has head of the Commonwealth, or on any comparable scale.

&gt;And for the record I really don't have much against the royal family, most of them seem pretty sound, I'm just not convinced Britain needs them anymore.

Nobody is saying we need them; it's just transparently clear that they are net contributors. ",0,1338832443,null,0,1338857614,0,c4w5xsd,t3_ujzt3,t1_c4w5xsd,t1_c4w4ncb,null,1429066460,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Watch the 11th Doctor's adventures over and over, but also take some time to study the others as well, learn the intricacies of his personality and apply them to your own. Find out just what makes him tick, rather than simply spouting ""X are cool, I do Y now."" It helps when acting to forget that you're acting. Immerse yourself so into the world that you can slip into the character and if someone would come to you and say ""Hey Spiraleclipse, how's it going?"" You wouldn't react to them calling your name, since your name is The Doctor, and you would let them know.

Basically be The Doctor at all times, even when you're alone. If you can convince yourself, you can convince others. Now there may be times when people drop the charade and then treat you as a normal person, and then it is your own personal choice whether you drop it as well or stay as The Doctor.

One thing that may help is to wear your costume often. It doesn't have to be out to anything big, it can be just around your house, but you need to feel comfortable in whatever you're wearing, that includes everything from the shoes to the braces. The Doctor wears these things while running throughout the universe and he is right at home in them, so you should be perfectly comfortable in them at the expo.

Carry your sonic EVERYWHERE for a while. Get into the habit of sonicing things and taking readings, and if you can mimic the Doctor's flourish as he does it, then more power to you.

The facts are, there are attackers, and even poorly formed logic or misrepresentation's of fair comparisons can not mask the actual threats. The reality is its all a balance of politics, risk assessments, social expectations and a myriad of interrelated aspects that result in money being spent on things.

explanations
1) the way luiz plays i want to see him try cdm, if it doesnt work, mikel/lampard at cdm with maybe cahill on the bench
2) i think it would be cool to see mata hazard and ramires rotate around the center and to either wing, seeing as all 3 can play each position. it would be incredibly confusing to any defense, and though it may confuse them at first, thats what the summer tour is for.
3) subs would be Turnbull, Hutch, Lamps, Marin, Lukaku

Yes, because the principle that the people of this country are citizens who get to choose who represents them as their head of state, rather than subjects of a monarch to question the privilege of whom is treason and who vests theoretically unlimited power into the government, is more important to me than any cultural benefits we might get.

I need one foreigner to have bought any piece of Royal memorabilia, and for that business, private or otherwise, to have filed a tax return to prove you wrong.  You don't think Windsor Castle has a gift shop?  It does, they do tours too.  It costs an adult £17, [in case you're wondering](http://www.windsor.gov.uk/things-to-do/windsor-castle-p43983).

Outright wrong.  Linking to a site that advocates removing the Republic is no more convincing than your own words simply because you said so.

Let's go to academia:

              ""Prior to 1688 the whole of the expenses of the state 
               were defrayed from the King‟s land revenues. When
               Parliament assumed responsibility for the provision of 
               funds for the upkeep of the Royal household as well as 
               the expenses of Government the surrender of the 
               revenue for the lifetime of the Sovereign was regarded 
               as a corollary.""

'Revenue for the lifetime', not deeded landed.  Moreover the 'agreement' reached is that profits from the land is bequeathed in return for a state purse.  No state purse: no agreement.

This is a commonly used argument but it disregards the fact that the Head of State [does not have to be the Head of Government.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_heads_of_state_and_government) If there were to be a republic, I would much rather the post of president not be a political post. There are plenty of fine Britons that could represent the country with dignity with no politics attached.

&gt;What democratic values has she suppressed?

Well that's easy, being *born* to rule the country is hardly a democratic principle. That's not to say that I think she's been bad, on the contrary, I think she has been one of the best monarchs that this country has seen and one of the greatest Heads of State of modern times. If there was a vote tomorrow, I'd probably vote for her. The thing is can we trust that Charles or future generations will be the same? What if he really doesn't have the trust of the people or inadvertently and repeatedly embarrasses the nation? Anything could happen... so the British people have to put up with it until he abdicates (not likely) or we vote him out (we can't).

The first thing the current monarch did after her coronation was to go on a world tour of the newly formed Commonwealth, something that is of more significance today than perhaps any time in her tenure.  Whilst there is some concern over a Charles throne he is at best an interim given the current Monarch's longevity.  Charles will only ever be a brief hop to William - and there is a Royal with mass popularity, even if because of the early events in his life.  Make no mistake, he's a modernist too.

Even if you look at the Crown Estate alone it reinvests over a £100m a year into land, business and redevelopment.  Again, it costs the taxpayer £40m, and even if you replaced The Crown you'd still have to; pay for another head of state, without the training and years of practice, open it up to politics, manage any trusts, ultimately privatise much of the land into other hands, make efficiency drives to compensate for 100% of the revenue going to state, and then compensate for the extra revenue they bring in because of their celebrity and standing.

Then there's the thing that however golden the cage, however much they earn the UK for how little the UK gives them, you know that the Royals are so heavily invested in the UK, historically and actually, their loyalty to Great Britain is beyond question.

Also I think I spent most of my Jobseekers on bus fares to town to hand out CVs, baccy and video games. Weed is way too expensive for someone like myself who doesn't want to go through the effort of raking pennies together, calling a dealer, meeting said dealer and then hoping I have enough for some kingskins and a new lighter.

This is the first long term employment i've had in 4 years so I have no idea what to do with my wages so I spend them on taking my missus out to dinner and going out places with my mates.

My hobbies are quite geeky though, that book I got for free was a copy of [the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay expansion book called Death on the Reik.](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Enemy-within-Campaign-Warhammer/dp/1899749071/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338857065&amp;sr=8-1) Which is worth a lot of cash and like rocking horse shite to get on the cheap let alone free.

I play xbox a lot too, just rebought New Vegas for the DLC packs that came with it, and thinking about restarting Skyrim and I may buy the Game of Thrones game that's out on the 8th.

I might buy the game on a whim I have a few games to trade in at the minute so I can get it a little cheaper. As for FO3 I bought the luchbox on release day and I traded in my original new vegas to get skyrim on release night, I bought it again because I wanted to complete all the DLC and try out some other paths through the story too.

When it comes to unemployment and benefits, there are many here amongst us who say ""they should have to work for a living"", but this is a standard which is only applied to those who are born poor - it is not a standard which is applied to the idle children of inherited wealth. 

The monarchy are symbolic of this status quo - getting rid of them wouldn't solve generational wealth inequality overnight, but in defending them you're basically saying that it's ok for some people to be born rich (and never have to work a day in their lives) whilst others are born poor and have to struggle for necessities.

Amy surfaced for breath, puzzled at the nature of the TARDIS swimming pool. While the library was a largish and distinctly libraryish room, the swimming pool was a giant orb of water which floated, free of the restraints of gravity or physics, in the center of the room. Where Amy had surfaced, she realised she was actually upside down, and staring face to face with her right side up future counterpart. 

""Wedding. Tomorrow. Answers,"" Amy sputtered. 

""Crack in the universe. Robots. Plastic Romans,"" Future Amy replied with a shrug. 

""Rory?""

At that, Future Eleven cut in, gently boosting Future Amy up into the TARDIS swimming pool. ""Oh don't you worry about that,"" Future Eleven stated. ""He'll be here.""

Eleven's head and shoulders emerged from the water beside Amy, and he stared around, puzzled, as he wiped the water from his swim goggles and straightened a bowtie that was all he wore. ""Or he was here,"" Eleven said. 

""Exactly,"" Future Eleven said. ""He was here. He'll be here. He might be here. We're not entirely sure. Wibbly Wobbly.""

""Timey Wimey,"" Eleven added.

""Orgy Worgy,"" shouted Future Amy, just as the tiniest of tiny skirts was kicked out of the watery orb of the swimming pool to fall to the floor of the library. 

""Orgy Worgy?"" asked Eleven.

""You get used to it,"" said Future Eleven, as he kicked off his shoes. ""Now, swimming! I love swimming! Swimming is cool!""",0,1338873802,null,0,false,0,c4wfzpv,t3_uk67q,t1_c4wfzpv,t1_c4wfbgm,null,1429071276,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

There are very few meaningful conversations that you can have on a show without bringing spoilers of some kind into the mix and sitting there wringing your hands because of spoilers from almost a year ago is just silly. Catering to the fools who subscribed to a reddit devoted to a show and who are FAR behind on the show is just crazy. That's like someone getting pissed when I say ""Jesus gets betrayed by Judas"" it's just silly.

As for my edit: I am pointing out that if the show is somehow ruined for you because you found out some detail early that means that all you found joy from in the show was some cheap question and if that's all the show had to offer for you then A) You're an idiot for going to a forum devoted to discussion on the show and B) If that's all the show was worth to you in the end then you should thank us for saving you the time required to find the answer to the question which is all you apparently wanted out of the show in the first place.

As for the whole ""It's only 10 keystrokes"" argument you failed to take into account that it requires that everyone meticulously comb through every post they make so that some idiot who purposely subscribed to a forum which discusses Dr. Who before they were even remotely close to caught up on the show can remain blissfully unaware of future events which everyone does not necessarily give a shit about (ESPECIALLY 8 months after the fact).

I really hope you're not serious. When someone says to you *there's nothing on TV tonight* do you grab your copy of TV Times and show them they're wrong?

&gt;To be very clear - because I guess I've not been clear enough, I presented you 3 occasions where there were 'attackers' as a rebuttal to your comment that ""there are no attackers"".

I made it clear enough that what I was saying is not that there have never been any attackers (surely I wouldn't be saying that) and not even there are absolutely no attackers in existence today but that *to all intents and purposes the significance of attackers is as low as if there were none* this is not that hard to grasp, surely. You have even grudgingly acknowledged you understood this is what I was suggesting. 

Let me be doubly clear: 

Q: Are there any attackers? 

A: To all intents and purposes, no. By this I mean to say that there may be attackers but the threat they pose is inconsequential compared to the threats that people face every day. In the event someone does an attack, it is not serious enough to warrant the inception of a police-state which is where the security measures that have been introduced since the 911 thing are leading us. It is not enough to warrant missiles on the roof when presumably the country is already defended against violent threats by the armed forces and intelligence services. 

I think there are no attackers because no one has attacked for a decade and any potential attackers have been given plenty of reasons to attack since we have attacked them far more severely than they could ever dream of attacking us. The lack of attackers in the last ten years has me convinced that the likelihood of attack is remote enough for us not to worry about beyond the usual measures, such as they are. Also, if reducing the threat of attack is a priority, I would prefer it if we ceased attacking others in order that they should not feel the (legitimate) desire to retaliate. 

Also, any alleged attackers or attacks that have been brought to the public's attention are so hilariously absurd, incompetent or blatantly contrived by the security forces that it only serves to enhance one's assessment that there are no attackers (to all intents and purposes and of any significance yadayadayadah). I am thinking of the shoe bomber, the pants bomber and the inc cartridge plot from Yemen. I am thinking of the FBI constructed non-plots, the siege on Heathrow due to a sudden fear of exploding soft-drinks and the pathetic security circus that goes on at airports and soon, perhaps, on your local high street. 

If you would like to clarify why you think I am suffering from cognitive dissonance, please feel free. Or you can say something about why you think my suggestion there are no attackers is wrong, bearing in mind the statement, although not to be taken literally, is clearly in the present tense so your mention of the violence of a decade ago is neither here nor there since I didn't say *there have never been attackers*. 


By-the-by you might consider looking in to your inability to absorb statements like *there's nothing on tv* in context. It could be a sign of psychosis.
