Which is why it wouldn't really kill them to inform you of such a change, considering they're your bank. But why bother, when fining you is such easy money for them? You're asking me to not shoot the messenger when the messenger is taking advantage.

&gt;You're complaining about the wrong people. 

I don't think I am, really. My bank is supposed to help with my account, not act as a gatekeeper that asserts it's not their job to notice burglars....50% of the time.

&gt;If you run your account at a level where you can't afford a DD to go out without going overdrawn, whose fault is that?

Well, let me see - how many companies accept standing orders these days, where any change has to go via a request to you? Try doing this with Vodafone, for example.

&gt;Why is it their responsibility to run YOUR account in good order?

Because that's part of the service they *used* to provide - and still do in a way, but these days it's fraud prevention freezing your account when you pay a charity £1 through ebay (this has happened to me three times). I'm not sure when things changed from 'we've noticed a change in your account' to 'someone decided to change the date on which they take money out of your account - sorry we didn't warn you, that'll be £20 please.

And that's before they offer services I *don't* need, such as AA cover and the like for another £15 per month, on top of the £10 a month 'account charge' for the privelige of making money by partly using yours (and which you have to *visit the branch* to cancel, which is about as legit as insisting that it costs them £10 for a server to auto-generate and send you a letter).

true,OneMonthWhovian,tardis,TARDIS,"I kind of disagree. Rose's love interest is not the centre of the RTD era, it's more of how the Doctor copes with loneliness and loss in spite of all that power, and how the companions strive to have lives that are infinitely better than something mundane.

Rose's love is an after effect of those two intentions meeting together--you can even say it's something inevitable. Here's this man who does not have anybody at all: he's the last of his kind, he has dominion over time and space, and yet has no one to share that with. Here's this girl who is bored with her everyday existence. The man meets the girl, who is of course eager to go on an adventure with her, even though it's incredibly dangerous. The girl meets this man who isn't only charming, but also powerful, incredibly good-hearted, and literally gives her the stars and the moon.

And the same applies to Martha's longing for the Doctor's affection, as well as Donna's frantic search for the Doctor. (And which is why I think Donna has the most tragic story out of all three--she lost *everything* that makes her life not mundane, even the memories. That's worse than being trapped in another dimension.)

It wasn't because the companions were tied with Rose that I find them appealing and easy to sympathize with as characters--it's because they clearly displayed *human* desires and traits. I can easily get why each character acted that way, it was *organic*.

I say *kind of* disagree because without Rose, of course, all the things that happened afterwards with Martha and Donna would not have any bearing at all. Rose changed the Doctor.

Whereas with Amy, everything seems too authored. The fact that she was a girl who waited for the Doctor was incredibly interesting, but Moffat didn't use that well at all. I can't even think of what her motivations are.

I know she has faith in the Doctor, her ""raggedy man,"" but it's not as potent as the previous companions' faith. (The scene in 42 where Martha was drifting towards her death but still believes that the Doctor can save her is one powerful moment I can cite as an example.) With Amy, that faith seems all tell and no show. Not because of Amy's character, but because she wasn't plunged into any situation where that faith would be put to the test. (Angel in her eye, sure, but not really. C'mon, all she needed to do was close her eyes. :P)

And I agree with you that River is fabulous. I think she is the only redeeming thing in Series 5. They could have pushed her character more, but overall she's written well.",0,1346945793,null,0,false,0,c64bkug,t3_zfl0b,t1_c64bkug,t1_c649pc5,null,1429832233,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,impablomations,northumberland,Northumberland,"According to the Govt. own figures, fraud rates for DLA are actually less than 0.5%.  DLA is actually quite hard to get, contrary to what the Daily Mail would have people believe. lol

According to research I read a while ago, a large part of the reason for the increase in DLA recipients is due to the fact that once you reach 65, if you are already getting it - then you can continue to claim for the rest of your life.

DLA has only been around for 20yrs or so, if claimants who originally were awarded it in the 90's reach retirement age - they will still get it, so that will inflate the numbers quite a bit.  It's not a case of an increased number of people being awarded DLA - but more people being able to keep the benefit after retirement, whether they still qualify or not.  

Also, in the 20yrs since DLA was created medical treatments have advanced so that in some cases people who might have died and therefore not be claiming, are now alive and claiming - especially in the case of children.

You also have a large number of people living in care homes who get the upper rate of DLA.  If this money is being used for soley for the claimant and their transport then I have no problem, however there are cases like in the home I used to work in  - ALL of the claimants (12 people) got the upper rate of DLA and it was all taken by the home owners.  We had 1 ancient minibus (that the owner bought for £500 second hand) as transport for the residents that certainly didn't cost £600+/week to run - money could certainly be saved in cases like that.

&gt;However, the story of you and your friends benefit loss is wrong and makes me feel rather sick that Atos (I believe they classify each case?) can leave you in such a situation

Much as I hate ATOS - they are only following the rules for DLA qualification set down for them by the govt.


Some of the new benefit qualifications in PIP are actually not bad, at least it has provisions for people with mental health problems now (albeit barely), but the mobility test being slashed to 50m is the biggest problem - if that was increased back to 200m then a lot of the people who would get screwed would be ok.",0,1346946097,null,0,false,0,c64bno2,t3_zepf5,t1_c64bno2,t1_c64ban1,null,1429832272,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,tobbern,null,null,"In my opinion neither are very subtle but they tell very different types of stories. One is grand and philosophical, while the other is personal and emotional, often psychological.

RTD loves grand scale stuff. The universe is always at risk in the season finals, and the Doctor can only solve the conflict by making a huge sacrifice, losing a companion or by being forced into making a choice that violates his moral compass. 

Moffat makes personal stories that are extremely emotional in nature, but do not set the universe at risk. The stories are about the Doctor and especially his companions. More than ever, in fact, the companions are part of shaping the story in Doctor Who and the relationship between them is dynamic as opposed to monotone, where in the old series the Doctor’s personality would simply dominate theirs. Moffat has concentrated so much on Rory and Amy that when they disappear, and they will, he will be working with brand new material. They are integral to the story in a way that Rose, Martha, Jack and Donna never were. Well, I guess Rose is comparable, but she was only really key to the story for one season.

Anyway, what really sets them apart is the use of the old Doctor Who story and most importantly The Time War. Eccleston and Tennant depicted Doctor Who as a character who is still burdened with the memory of the war, and has vivid recollections of it. He sees it everywhere around him wherever he goes and cannot escape it. Smith on the other hand seems to be completely cut off from it. Moffat cut that umbilical cord of story-telling and made the Doctor less bound by his past, which has allowed him to focus on the present. Remember, the original Doctor was ""on the run"" from the Time Lord, and then the Time War began. After that, he ran because he wanted to escape confronting himself. Now that he has done this several times, he is trying to enjoy himself, and so there is much less risk of the universe ending if he goes to indulge himself somewhere with his friends Amy and Rory. That being said, we are all expecting the time when the Doctor will once again have to face his demons. It is common for this to happen. While it is remarkable to see what happened in the last episode, there still remain many life forms in the universe that want him dead, captured, or for that matter – his help. 

Both are nice storytellers, and I would recommend not trying to rank them. People like to do it but I find it frustrating and it ruins the experience of watching the show. Regenerations are inevitable just as the show is handed over to new writers. Doctor Who is unique because the two tend to happen simultaneously, unlike other TV shows. I love ethical dilemmas and I agree with you that RTD is better at those, but Moffat also presents valuable stories with great personal appeal. I like many of the Doctors too, primarily Tennant, then Baker, then Smith. It is a unique sci-fi story because depending on which Doctor you started with, you formed a strong relationship with that one Doctor. Most sci fi stories have a continuous cast, and that changes almost everything. Every viewer has “their own” Doctor, which is part of what makes the show so wonderful. The show has been on TV for so long and watched by multiple generations around the world. It is nice to have something to relate over.

I actually find Amy and Rory to be dispensable. They're always in the sidelines, they don't have the sort of connection that the previous companions have with the Doctor.

The address on the website is a house, and the address registered is to ""Startup Business Services."" It is pretty common to us an accountant or business services place to register a business, but not the most secure thing. Do you know if the business has an office? If so, it is a little sketchy to use a home address.

The website isn't appearing in a WHOIS search, which usually means that it is less than 48 hours old. But the company has existed since November 2010, so I don’t understand it.

The company had two directors, James and Jake, who I assume are brothers. Jake’s appointments were officially ended at the end of July this year.  This isn’t a necessarily a bad thing, but is also not the greatest sign. Family drama can suck to work around.

The surname James uses on the website differs from his surname that he registered the business too. This is sounding even sketchier.

In their last “statement of capital” the company only had £1. I am not a business guy, so I don’t know how to interpret this.

I also can’t find any evidence of them ever marketing themselves.

I don’t think any of these on their own are necessarily bad, but when you combine them all, I wouldn’t be confident about the business.

ah yes stimulus, what does that mean, stimulate rhe economy to increase gross domestic product. The last set of figures I saw showed that the construction industry was the weakest part of the economy, so it would be misplaced I suspect, the great thing about the construction industry is those working in that sector are made up of lots of independent contractors who will stimulate the economy in the traditional way, spending that money on stuff. 

If the money goes to large IT companies they will probably bank most of the profits as lots are doing currently and using their own salaried staff.

true,tangled_foot,uk,The Toon,"Continent? Are you planning on going to mainland Europe? I'm going to assume that was a typo and just talk about the UK. If you do want to go to Europe I suggest getting the Eurostar from London St Pancras, book in advance and its the easiest and quickest way. You can do a night in paris with ease.

Weather wise, October - probably quite a bit of rain, definitely bring the best waterproof coat you have, might be lucky though, this summer has been a bit all over the place. Not too cold though, maybe 10C on average, bring a couple of jumpers and a jacket and you'll be fine, you can always buy a scarf (or maybe even a coat!) or something here if you need.

I'm just going to list places that are good to visit that you might not have thought of, 

[Brighton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton) and Oxford are both good for a night out of London, 
Places around the south west, like [Avebury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avebury), [Lacock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacock), [Glastonbury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury) you'll probably want to go to stone henge, all americans do, but Avebury is better, make sure you visit [bath](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_Somerset), I'd stay in a hostel in bristol and go and see these places as day trips either on the train or hire a car, [Salisbury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury) is interesting too, and has an epic cathedral. You could head on down to devon, and there is nice stuff down there i.e. [Tintagel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tintagel) and little cornish fishing villages like [clovelly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovelly), a lot of the coast is a [world heritage site](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornwall_and_West_Devon_Mining_Landscape) and it is beautiful but how much fun it would be might be weather dependant. 

[Durham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham) is worth a visit, Edinburgh obviously, [Bamburgh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamburgh) is a cool castle up there, if you like castles then 100% get to the good ones in Wales, [Caernarfon](http://www.castlewales.com/caernarf.html) is very good, [Chepstow](http://www.castlewales.com/chepstow.html) too. I'd visit [Whitby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitby) if you're able, its got a cool abbey that Henry VIII destroyed, in a similar vein [Fountains Abbey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountains_Abbey) is good. Get out to the Lake district if you can, there's loads to see there, amazing views if you climb up the hills around ullswater, if you know the stories of beatrix potter her [house](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_Top,_Cumbria) is surprisingly interesting, there are 100s of stately homes about the place too, [Chatsworth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatsworth_House) is one of the nicer ones, but also [Hampton Court Palace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Court_Palace) will blow your mind, and that's basically in London. Windsor castle too.

Hope that's some ideas for you, personally I wouldn't pick a 'home city', you'll spend your whole time on trains, I'd do days in London first (maybe a day trip to Oxford), then do a few nights in youth hostels around the place, seeing the sites in those areas, then head back to london at the end, couple of nights in Paris or Brussels (or both) - Brussels is awesome btw, and a short train ride from brugges, which is also awesome. Then back to London for a night and fly home. 

Maybe try to get to a football match, in London you can get cheap tickets for Fulham, but the atmosphere is kind of shit, Tickets are about £20-30, but it depends on the club, go onto their websites to check for availability.",0,1346951690,null,0,1346961125,0,c64d41c,t3_zgewu,t1_c64d41c,t3_zgewu,null,1429832948,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

So I can somehow imagine her parents falling through the crack (although the one in her bedroom did not lead to  to the void, but rather to the prison of prisoner 1, wasn't it?). And somehow the ducks from the pond have walked up to her bedroom and jumped into the crack, too? Well, okay.

But what about her missing memories concerning the Daleks? The crack did not affect memories alone, right? Only the memories of things that fell into the crack, or am I wrong?

After watching the ""Night and the Doctor"" mini-episodes (thanks for the hint!), I gathered that ""memories in general are a mess, because time is rewritten constantly"". But then that would be the case for all people, not just Amy, right? So everyone's life should ""not make sense"", not just Amy's.

I love Japan and go regularly but for many this is a once in a lifetime trip, many are foregoing the away CL games to save up for the extremely expensive week in Japan. I don't think they need to be told that the club doesn't care as much as they do. As it stands we only have roughly 2 more games this coming season than the likes of United and City. Play the kids in the League Cup as usual and let the senior players handle business in Japan, it's not a very difficult task to manage the squad more than it would have needed to be anyway

At the end of the day the CWC essentially carries the title of 'Best team in the World' and has it's own badge to add to the jersey. It's also an opportunity to make a statement in the most valuable continent in terms of football supporter economics

There was a lot of ill feeling from the fans who traveled to Monaco to watch that shambles, that hardcore group of fans (which I do not include myself in as my financial/lifestyle situation means this isn't a big expense for me) who take time off work, save up for months and follow Chelsea wherever in the world they are, wherever the flag is raised, deserve better

Edit: To clarify the economics line, United's record Chevrolet deal is based mainly around the Chinese market. Most of the promotional material I've seen is in Mandarin and using vehicles sold mainly in Asia/Europe as opposed to North American models. We also benefit from an Asian company looking to increase it's brand image, Liverpool have Standard Chartered who derive the vast majority of their profits in Asia/Middle East, despite being headquartered in London.

Use [Eastcoast](http://www.eastcoast.co.uk/) to work out train costs, basically the UK is great, because its compact, so you won't spend 10 hours staring through the window at empty fields, but your limiting factor will be cost. A one way ticket from London to Edinburgh booked in advance is £60 and from Bristol to Manchester is £40 and London to Bristol £30, so it can soon add up. Those are all double the price for returns, but make sure you book in advance, you can use your credit card on the internet and then collect your ticket from the machines at the station. 

Petrol is currently rocking at about 1.40 L which is $8.28 per US gallon, for comparison. So, if you decide to, the price of hiring a car will be nothing compared to what you'll spend on petrol.

Strain the liquid and put in the fridge to separate the stock from the fat cap.  Pick through the remains for the edible scraps that you can use to make soup or put in chicken fried rice.  Grill the skin to make chicken chips to sprinkle on other things.  Once the stock has set in the fridge take off the fat cap to use as oil for future chicken dishes.  Use the stock as the base for any number of future dishes.  

When you're really on a budget it is a legitimate concern that the chickens didn't have a nice life in the factory farm.

1. First, turn off your central heating or cooling system so fumes aren't moved from one room to another. Then open up the windows and let the room ventilate for 15 minutes.
2. Next, it's time to clean up the broken bulb. Put on gloves to make sure you don't touch any of the mercury powder. Use a piece of cardboard to scoop up large pieces of glass. Switch to sticky tape to pick up small fragments and shards. Don't use your vacuum cleaner, and make sure all broken pieces, tape and cardboard are placed in a plastic bag.
1.    Finally, wipe the area with a damp paper towel and place the used towel in the plastic bag, as well.
1.   Seal the bag and immediately throw it away.

true,JeffFavorWrites,null,null,"Well, it's something new and something I've never done before. I'm able to be funny on stage (Apparently. I don't really see it), but I've never attempted to write comedy before. It never really crossed my mind before last Saturday. I was watching Asylum of the Daleks and when Rory sprinted to the door to get away from the killer Daleks all I could think about was Oswin telling him that there's Toll House cookies at the end of the hallway. Watching the episode made me think of a bunch of jokes like that, most of which were garbage. When I made it home from my friend's house to watch the episode again I started saying some of my jokes out loud and a lot of it was workable. It seemed like a good challenge with a potentially good audience and it'd be writing on something I really love. If there was any place for me to start trying to write comedy this would be the first baby steps to getting good at it. 

I'm not the funniest person in my peer group, but I can make *some* people laugh. I'd like to believe that I don't have the worst taste in humor and that I'm creative enough to come up with something different. I knew writing this post that there'd be some people who'd enjoy it and there'd be (Probably More) people who hated it. The responses I've gotten back so far have been wonderful. I'm waiting on someone to give me some good criticism, because I'd really like to get better at this. It was the most fun I've had writing anything in a really long time. I had a deadline, I had a goal, and I worked the hours and finished a day early. It was a lot of fun to write, and it's made a couple of people laugh, so I think I count this as a win.

I liked how the finished product came out, and I thought it'd be worth sharing with Reddit. This is the first thing I've shared with any community outside of Facebook. For me it's a win/win situation. If it gets upvoted, or even makes a couple of people laugh momentarily, I did my job as a writer and I've made some people happy. If it gets downvoted, because it isn't funny or it my writing is worse than I thought it was, it gives me a general place to start working up from; If it's on par with Doctor Who fan-fiction involving The Doctor and Rory spending late nights in the TARDIS swimming pool alone, which I really hope it isn't, at least I know it's only up from here.

Road coaches can get you between cities cheaper than the railways, but I can't give you an idea of the cost because I always stump up for the train.",0,1346970466,null,0,false,0,c64i58n,t3_zgewu,t1_c64i58n,t1_c64eas1,null,1429835389,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It's important that you realise that everyone everywhere has a bias, and it is difficult if not impossible to remove it completely. Newspapers can and do have honest reporting while carrying a slant. Where does the bias come in? Perhaps some information is left out because the reporter (mis)judged it as unimportant. The editors are in charge of the news agenda, and barring obvious front-page stories (e.g. budget, election, war declaration) which they'd be stupid _not_ to put at the top, it's up to them to decide what order the stories appear in, in which page, and how much space it takes on the page. Even online, the editors have limited space to decide what are the most important stories of what they have today, and order them in descending order from the most to the least.

Automatic transferral of your organs just doesn't sit right with me. I get all the arguments, I sympathise with most of them, yes thinking you need to be in one piece to please your God or whatever is pretty stupid **but** I just think organ donation is something that should only be done with explicit consent.

Partly because absolutely no one should have automatic rights to anyone's organs under any circumstances and partly because it would be a system that is inherently unfair to those that don't wish to donate organs. If you think 29% is low just wait until it's the other way around and there is exactly zero incentive to advertise the fact you can opt out.

If you plan on using the railway a lot it might be worth getting some kind of multi-journey ticket. Despite what some people might say the system *generally* works pretty well.

Prices aren't that bad if you book well in advance but if you're likely to be just walking up and getting lots of tickets on the day that'll add up quickly.

There are various options for multi-journey tickets;

There's an ""[All Line Rover](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/promotions/pr569241c35ce74100fb0de1b9798124/details.html)"" which is valid on almost any route for 14 days ([or 7 days](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/promotions/pr20780b0a0400020167ed620a7e504e/details.html)), there are some restrictions which look to be on mainline services at peak times. Other ""rover"" (multi train) tickets [are here](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/promotions/rangers_and_rovers.html)

Also, take a look at **[http://www.britrail.com/](http://www.britrail.com/)**, they have passes for the whole country specifically designed for tourists.

Be warned though, trains won't be brilliant for really local travel in many parts of the country, especially in rural areas.

The britrail site has [this map](http://www.britrail.com/images/stories/britrail-map.pdf) showing where the trains go and what the different passes cover, and [this is the rather more busy National Rail map](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/passenger_services/maps/OfficialNationalRailmaplarge.pdf)",0,1346974646,null,0,false,0,c64j6qa,t3_zgewu,t1_c64j6qa,t1_c64eas1,null,1429835879,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I am UK player, have been playing DotA for quite a while (I was VIP on Dota-league and also had played in a number of teams on the DotA-league team league in the bottom divisions). I can stomp the pubs on Dota 2 but have just been really messing around on it doing stupid stuff with my brother (who might also be interested more seriously, but is pushing for top8 masters on sc2), but yeah I really miss playing actual team games because that is where DotA2 is the best.

My thought is maybe I can be on the team rooster and play in some scrims (or pub stomps to begin) when I can with my limited time schedule and be a fill in type player for your team. I would just love to be part of a UK team again for above reasons, but am torn because of time. I'm 21 going back to do a Physics masters at cambridge.

But then this opt out idea came about for the government censoring porn. The primary reason i'm against that is that I don't believe the government should have the right to censor the internet in that way, even though you can opt out. Plus I believe it will make no difference as they underestimate the younger generations ability to use the internet and find ways to bypass the block.

This has made me think that many people may also hate the idea of the government doing what they want with your body after you die unless you say otherwise.

I have been playing DotA on and off, in some form or another, for roughly ~7 years (I vaguely remember when Invoker was implemented in v6.10), ever since I was a wee nipper - I started playing very actively at roughly v6.48, when Puck was implemented . In many ways, DotA has become my main interest and is an integral part of my life. Since I got my Dota 2 key in February, I have been an extremely active player, clocking up ~1350 hours of play - an average of 7 hours of play, every day, for 6 months straight. Got about ~900 games logged in total, not including scrims and clan wars.

I am dedicated and committed to taking my game to the next level, and would be glad to regularly participate in scrims, tournaments and ladder play. My best roles are solo mid and side solo, but I can play any role my team requires.

I live in Wakefield, West Yorkshire but I'm moving to Lancaster in a months time, same general area :) I also have a few friends from the UK who play DotA, aren't as skilled as me but they'd be up for pubs and stuff anyway if needed.

Here are my stats on Dotabuff: https://dotabuff.com/players/79674084

I currently have just above a 50% win rate, but I have previously been as high as 70%.

Big picture though, the Daleks don't har a huge entry about how the Doctor thwarted them in the past, but they DO know that he was somehow on their ship and casually taunted them and teleported away while they were basically powerless to injure him. So, instead of ""he's the guy that did all that stuff to us,"" the Doctor is ""the one who we couldn't stop -- and DIDN'T kill us.""

So that kinda makes the Doctor no longer someone Daleks would think would be a great Dalek.

We just need to establish a grounding for a seriously competitive IHL within UKDotA, then support the teams that do well in the IHL. Through this support, they can become more popular as streamers or players. Seems only natural that the UK DotA pro scene should originate with a grassroots movement right here. And while this may not increase the presence of e-sports in the UK, it will increase of the presence of the UK in e-sports, which is just as good, provided the players are good enough.

Live in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, moving to Lancaster in a month (so all the same general area, grim up north and all that). I've played DotA for ~7 years, pretty much since v6.10 when Invoker was added(if anyone remembers the imba days). I've had my Dota 2 key since February and I've already clocked up 1350 hours and +900 games, which is pretty much 7 hours every single day for the last 6 months. I have previous experience in IHLs and competitive DotA play. I have a very good mic and Mumble, so I think I more than meet the requirements for high skill division play, even if I have to go through a few tryouts or something :)

My best roles are solo mid or side solo, but I can play any role and hero in the game to a mid-high degree of skill and i'm extremely experienced. I pride myself on my map awareness and sense of game timing.

My stats on Dotabuff: https://dotabuff.com/players/79674084

I'm at just over 50% win rate atm but I've been as high as 70%.

And my steam profile, for proof of my dedication to DotA and for anyone who feels like adding me, feel free :) : http://steamcommunity.com/id/-KarmA-

Btw I'm looking for a very high-skilled, committed and dedicated UK team for this IHL, just trying to gather together the best and most experienced from the UK into a British DotA powerhouse :D Looking to adopt a practise schedule, train regularly, play scrims and clan wars, top the UKDotA IHL and hopefully extend into casted tournaments and high-tier competitive play, anyone interested please add me on steam or pm me :))",0,1346980187,null,0,1346983657,0,c64kjev,t3_ze3la,t1_c64kjev,t3_ze3la,null,1429836515,1,false,UKDota,t5_2uyoj,1

true,TomShoe,1972crest,,"My knowledge of Manchester is that it was at one time very industrial, and thus very prosperous, in a very of working class kind of way, but that the end of the industrial era really took a tool on the local economy, and it has had a hard time recovering from this. Whether this is enough information for me to get a sense of the place, I have no real idea (though I'd love to here what an actual mancunian has to say about it), but the sense I get from what I do know is that it's very much a town that is where it is today in spite of the odds against it. Thirty years ago it was really in the same situation as Detroit—it could easily have become the biggest shit hole in western Europe, but instead it's now easily one of Britain's most economically active cities, home to some of the best music to come out of Britain —it's England's second city, and the club seems to share a real connection with the city it calls home. It's always had a tough go of it, but its successful in spite of that. Even though our success is largely indebted to Sheihk Mansour, it's hard to argue that City doesn't deserve the success it has begun to achieve, because the club—like the city that it is so closely tied to—has worked so hard for that success over the years, building and rebuilding itself.

So maybe this is all total BS, but it is my perception of Manchester, and it has a huge affect on how I view the club.

true,pikeybastard,null,null,"Would like to add the caveat before responding that to criticise Brown doesn't make you a Conservative, as I am not. Wimpy preamble, but some people do seem to downvote on guessing/second guessing people's political persuasion. Would rather be argued with or downvoted for what I say.

The thing that's wrong with Brown is that he didn't do a very good job, and did not seem interested in alternate viewpoints, just like Osborne.

People often mention the sale of Gold at its second lowest value in the last 80 years, and one person here said that it was to avert a gold crisis. The thing is, only one journalist has seriously advanced this argument and it doesn't really hold up. For example if you are dealing with a world gold crisis, a state would not take unilateral action in secret to alleviate it. The biggest beneficiaries of the sale were American banks and sellers of the recently formed Euro, which most of the gold was spent on. There was no need to do this, unless a shady deal had been agreed with the treasury, which other than human error is the only explanation for front running the sale. Therefore it is more likely that selling the gold after front running it was either down to human error or a too close relationship with large banks than to single-handedly avert a gold crisis. No chancellor would unilaterally cost their taxpayer $16billion+. Some Tories think that Brown did this to increase confidence in the Euro, but I don't think so, as the guy wasn't that strongly in favour of the whole euro thing, that that would be why.

Brown also oversaw the most significant deregulation of the banking industry in modern times, driven by arguments such as the third way, thinking that greater financial deregulation may just lead to an increased tax take and more money for government programs. He established the tripartite system to oversee this, which has been condemned even within the Labour party subsequently for being a fundamental cause of the banking crisis. The banks were essentially asked to regulate themselves and surprise of surprises pursued self interest. This is his biggest mistake. You can tell its a mistake because the banks spent 10 years saying how great it was.

He critically damaged confidence in pensions in this country, leaving public confidence in private pensions at their lowest in history, as he instituted a levy of over £5bn a year on the dividends that essentially make the pension funds pay. In a society and economy largely built around the pensions system that was a hug mistake.

Due to giving up on prudence in the good times in 2002 (he made his name in the late 90's on 'prudence') he started spending cyclically, leaving the UK with one of the highest structural deficits in the developed world *pre*2008. Although much of the government debt was accrued in the bank bailout, he still racked up over £30bn a year for several years in a boom- as simple a mistake as you can get- on the premise that he'd eradicate the bust- a huge leap of arrogance. This has made it harder for first his government and then the coalition to spend counter-cyclically, exacerbating the cuts. When even Labour in opposition say they would have cut significantly, you know that there is little give in the system.

As a consequence of this, he inherited a government debt that was approaching its lowest since before WW2, and left us with the highest since the war. More money as a consequence is spent by the government on interest than on anything bar the NHS and Social Security (welfare).

He put 1.8m of the poorest people in the country into financial hardship by abolishing the 10p tax rate to pay for a 2% tax decrease on far better off earners as a gamble to win votes.

His tax credit system proved a failure after hundreds of thousands of overpayments left families owing £1,000s, meaning that over 40% of families stopped claiming them due to fear of a bill in later years.

Very reductive, but he inherited the best economy any British chancellor has ever inherited, and when he left government left the following administration with the worst performing economy a government had received since at least 1979 and no fiscal give with which to provide a stimulus without worrying markets. You don't get to tie the hands of the next government and then sit on the sidelines and criticise.

He is credited with the years of growth, yet this ignored the fact that Ken Clarke carried out the reforms and stimulus that had already seen the country experiencing steady growth for significant time, following the last international recession. Brown even stuck to Clarke's spending plans until **2002**, which saw Britain's debt approaching landmark lows, before proceeding to borrow at a record level, arguing that the government should spend the proceeds of growth (which it had been doing, rather than the proceeds of debt accumulation).

He oversaw a consumer spending boom and housing boom that other figures such as Vince Cable warned would spark a debt crisis, yet denied that it was anything other than the result of a strong economy. Unfortunately, a strong economy would not have struggled to the degree that the UK did after 2008- a case in point being Germany, who had a lower tax burden and far lower private and public debt despite a recession in the late 90's.

He was instrumental in facilitating several wars, and although Blair takes the flak a Brown that opposed the conflicts would have rendered Blair's mission impossible. His position at the heart of cabinet and government was more firmly entrenched than Blair's, and he had a significant role in domestic and foreign policy. A good book to read on this as well as the uk constitution is 'who runs this place' by Antony Sampson (sp?), which was a comparison of the uk constitution in the 70's and today.

He was a strong supporter of Rupert Murdoch and News International, including giving the Sun and NOTW as much access as The Guardian, Times, Mirror and Independent combined until they ceased to support him and switched sides to the Tories. He isn't clear of the whole news crisis in the UK just because he switched sides.

There's much more, this was just stuff off of the top of my head that I thought I'd rattle off. I'm sure I've got some bits wrong, and someone will correct me. I just don't think that because George Osborne is a terrible chancellor and prize dickpiece (god even a poll of his own party membership says they think he should go) it doesn't mean that Gordon Brown was suddenly great. He is the prime architect of our economic position, all Osborne is is a lightweight and piss-poor firefighter. It amazes me that with figures like Clarke and Cable in the cabinet Cameron won't turn to them as Clarke has already got us out of 1 recession and Cable has credibility with much of the electorate.

Only 1 bloke in the telegraph really makes the argument about averting a gold banking crisis, as such a move is usually the preserve of international or supranational partners- why would the UK chancellor take such a huge hit not only to the nation's finances but his own reputation? There are far more people who argue that it was either a simple error or for other reasons less favourable to Brown, but those are speculative and a guy shouldn't take the hit for speculation.

And with EMA, why would you say its great? I'm not being a dick and saying it wasn't fair as I got the full £30 a week, but what made it worth the money for the government?

I also think the issue people have is that if he was a bully to people then he wasn't making reasoned judgements and considering other points of view, which certainly wouldn't help him govern well.

1) River killed ""the best man she has ever known.""  - that is going to be Rory.

2) Moffat has stated that the doctor will suffer a tremendous loss of a friend, and no companion has yet died in the new series.  

3) River was trying to kill the doctor in Lets Kill Hitler.  So if she grew up with Amy and Rory, does it make sense later in her life she tries to kill the doctor?

4) Rory is a fan favorite.  I think if Rory died, it will have a much greater emotional impact than if it's Amy.  Shit the man waited 2,000 years for her, how could River not admire him as ""the greatest man she has ever known""?

5) In the episode where River was arrested was an Angels episode.  It was on a spaceship.  It is entirely possible there is a connection here.  When River is arrested and taken away along with one of the angels, it will be on the same spaceship.

I'm pretty sure someone is going to die though, and i think smart money is going to be on Rory.  He's died so many times already, eventually it's got to be for good.

This episode is what sealed the deal for me as a Whovian. He took her to the end of the Earth for their first real trip. And that scene when Rose is overwhelmed when they start playing some ""classic"" Earth songs, and she sees all these alien people around her - it really hit me for some reason. I felt, in that moment, that this show was something more than a sci-fi show with some silly monsters here and there. It had an underlying sense fo realism when it came to emotions, mortality, and ethics.

And despite the cheesy CGI, it showed me that nothing in this show is off-limits, right off the bat.

Uh, that doesn't make sense.  She ""kills"" the doctor in 2010/1.  There is nobody around except Amy/Rory/1960s CIA guy.  It makes no sense that she'd then be arrested thousands of years in the future by 'clerics' with nobody who witnessed the event.  

&gt; Moffat lies

Doubt it this time.  

&gt; Either way she grew up with Amy and Rory

Yes.  She regenerated into Mels as a child in Manhattan, who was a friend of Amy's.  She grew up with her.  In Lets Kill Hitler, she kidnaps the two and she is killed during the assassination attempt.  She regenerates into River Song.

You don't think Amy and Rory growing up would think it odd that their best friend's parents are a lot like them?


&gt; River was not arrested in the Angels episode

Ok, you seem to be correct here.  But she is taken back to prison, so she was currently under incarceration by the society that the 'clerics' were from.  

It just doesn't follow that that arrest arose from the killing attempt in Lets Kill Hitler or in The Impossible Astronaut.  

The story of who she killed hasn't been told yet.  And from a story telling perspective it'd make sense to keep that for the end of the story arc.  ",0,1346994407,null,0,false,0,c64o4do,t3_zgxxj,t1_c64o4do,t1_c64mxic,null,1429838215,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

Before the World War 1:  Argentina, some parts of Austria, parts of Brazil, Burma, parts of Chile, China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Iceland, parts of Italy, Paraguay, Philippines, Sweden and Uruguay all drove on the left hand side of the road.

When Benito Mussolini came to power he changed the rules in Italy and Adolf Hitler changed the driving rules for Austria and Czechoslovakia when he came to power.

Going further back, the French drove on the left hand side of the road too. It was Napoleon who changed France to drive on the right hand side of the road.

So next time you're talking with a French person about why in the UK we drive on the left hand side of the road, you can tell them that over a third of the world population drives on the left and only before the first world war most of the world population drove on the left hand side of the road, so maybe they should be telling you why they changed to the right.

Moffat has not ""ruined"" the show, though. His plots are fun, and try to be deeper and better constructed than they are; this season looks to be gearing up for a lot of old school sci-fi throwbacks (the forbidden planet pose for ""Asylum"", titles like ""Dinosaurs on a Spaceship"" and ""The Angels Take Manhattan""), and I hope it fits the way Moffat attempts gravitas and delivers pulpy action.

true,Im_the_Zeppo,null,null,"First I'd like to point out that the production value, opening sequence and ""size"" of a story has little to do with davies/moffat. The fact of the matter is, once Moffat took over the show, Davies had built it up so much that the show was given a larger and larger budget (just look at ""Rose"" vs. ""The Eleventh Hour"" in terms of production value). I think Davies had a more difficult task in he had to reintroduce the doctor, the DW universe and created a large stable of beloved characters. Moffat had a nice cushion in that the show has an audience that doesn't need to have their hand held as much in the visual language of the show (despite those god-awful ""Amy explaining who the doctor is in the Netflix opening"", though this also has nothing to do with Moffat. So when you talk about the writing, don't talk about what it looked like, because then you're really talking about overall production value and directing -- both out of the control of Davies/Moffat (unless one of them had directed episodes)

I think Davies and Moffat are both excellent, though they each have shown some weaknesses. I think Moffat is a bit more into having a season-long arc (though, as pointed out earlier he has done wonderful stand-alone episodes) than Davies. Davies will not be as arc heavy and will rely on a story that takes place over the last few episodes that brings in hints dropped from earlier in the season, instead of having a singular question mark hovering over the season ie [spoiler](#s ""the doctor's death or amy's pregnancy."") Also previously mentioned, I think Moffat takes bigger swings, which leads to some outstanding work, though sometimes i feel like it's not as airtight in plotting as I'd like, but when he gets ahold of one, he hits it 500 feet (hooray baseball metaphors!)

At the end of the day, i think they're both tremendous talents and my favorite seasons are (starting with favorite): 4, 5, 3, 6, 2, 1. So it really is a mix of the two writers.  ",0,1346996144,null,0,false,0,c64oh51,t3_zgxfj,t1_c64oh51,t3_zgxfj,null,1429838374,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

true,RedditGoosebumps,null,null,"It's amazing really, living up here, forever cast in seemingly oils and pigments...to have so many human eyes looking at me, and none seeing. This is how I, The Doctor, became trapped. It wasn't long ago, days really, when it happened....I was fine, on all accounts, except that I was lonely...quite lonely actually. And I sat thinking in my beautiful machine that a creature like me doesn't deserve to be lonely! (I'm quite fun you see.) So I set it to myself to find someone to keep me company. My first thought was Oswin, she was a darling human and would understand my plight of loneliness- but there were quite a few issues with that plan I'm afraid. The next choice was the obvious one, but I didn't know if she'd come with me for a bit. ""A vacation!"" I would call it, ""Geronimo!"" I would say to her...so I did. I took myself to Amy's house, at a time I was pretty sure Rory would be working at the hospital, and invited the brilliant Amelia Pond along with me. She took some convincing but finally we were off...and for that I am very sorry. We traveled, with no real destination, just taking a quick glimpse at the many corners of the galaxy and a few corners outside our galaxy, if you can imagine. It was like the good old days, just two friends, exploring the outskirts of space and time... nothing out of the ordinary. It was in the future that it happened...well now it's my personal past...and now it's my indefinite future... But anyhow, there we were, looking at the most marvelous blue dwarf, when a something landed inside the TARDIS. I didn't see it at first, but Amy was distracted by a movement at the control panel. It was a tiny thing, cockroach-like almost, with a head with black eyes and visible claws on it's tiny, tiny little hands. It peered over at us and pressed a button (I couldn't tell you which, I've never pressed that button before in my life) and the TARDIS shook like it's never shaken before. And she crashed. Amy and I, nearly unscathed, stood up- she described the alien to me as I'd hardly seen it and nearly forgotten its appearance after a nice conk to the head. We searched around for a kind of ship and found it- it was the size of a fez (fantastic!) and round like that, but when you picked it up it felt like there was liquid inside. It didn't have an obvious door and the cockroach was no where to be found. We stepped outside tentatively and stood on a New York City street at night. Amy, carrying the ship, let out a scream. The ship had begun to vibrate, much like the TARDIS before crashing. It shook and shook and she dropped it on the ground. I pulled out my sonic but it was too late. The ship made a terrible popping noise and burst all over the wall and on the TARDIS and on us. The residue was wet and sticky... and alive... it crawled on my skin and as I tried to brush it off I watched Amy fall to the ground, fainted? ""She hasn't fainted, no,"" said a moist voice from behind me, ""she's been paralyzed."" I turned around slowly, my sonic raised... only to see a comparably gargantuan cockroach on the side of my beautiful TARDIS. ""Well that is not okay,"" I told the bug in my most stern voice. He laughed at me... it was a gross, blubbery sound like a wet cackle... ""Trust me, you'll wish you were paralyzed too, Biped."" He reached out to me and only then did I realize he was flat against the TARDIS- 2 dimensional in fact. Before he could pull himself up and into the third dimension, I picked up Amy, preparing to reenter the TARDIS and hope he'd disintegrate in the atmosphere...But as soon as I held her in my arms... he reached me. He stood just about my height and, while still attached to the TARDIS, spat on me. His mucus was wetter than his words, and it covered me like a wretched filth and it was heavy- strong, wet, and heavy. I felt my body begin to give under the weight of the stuff and he easily pushed me backwards...towards the wall... I was still holding Amy and only managed to look down at her quickly before looking my attacker in the eyes, determined. ""Sleep tight, Biped,"" he growled through dripping drool. I felt my body touch the cold, hard wall behind me and knew what was happening. With my mass depleting and my strength gone, I knew it was too late. Here is where I shall stand for the rest of my days...high against a wall in New York City, looking fiercely into the soul of my attacker.

Agencies get candidate CVs from Jobsites but usually in response to demand.

To be honest, they have it stitched up. They have researchers scraping every site going for potential roles, and have budgets in place to butter up HR directors for the first bite. 

Top tips:

- Smile while talking :)

- Always ask them if they have a role they are trying to fill before giving them your life story (although monologuing practice can be useful). 

- Steer the conversation around to Location, terms (perm / contract) and job title as soon as possible.

- Make sure your preferred salary / rate on job boards is £50 PD more than you would be willing to accept. If a contract that you match well offers more they will try and pitch it to you for the lowest figure.

- Always ask what their commission is (standard is @15% of contracts or 15% or first 3 months salary for perm).

- Don't call anyone back who doesn't at least mention a vacancy on your voice mail. Theres a good chance they are fishing for other roles you've applied to.

true,TragedyT,tardis,TARDIS,"I feel that overall, RTD's shows were more campy, more simplistic, more melodramatic, and aimed at a less mature audience than Moffat's.  There was rarely much room for subtlety or ambiguity in his shows, and quite often people would bluntly state how they felt about everything, spoonfeeding the audience everything, as though the characters lacked believable adult guile.

In fact, most of RTD's era seemed to me like it was aimed at young teenagers, especially with the Twilight-style mooning about over Rose.  I think because of this, some RTD fans are notorious for their overly-enthusiastic love of the romance of the Tennant era, with a blinkered outlook to the faults of that time when compared with Series 5 onwards.

I also found the thematic drift of some of RTDs tenure to be especially irksome, especially the 'Doctor-as-messiah', which was pretty nauseating at times.  Moffat has consciously tried to get away from this, perhaps a little too hard in the case of Series 6, making the Doctor slightly too unlikable and unheroic for a while, but I enjoyed the series overall.

Asylum of the Daleks was a fantastic episode, and I have high hopes for this series, although it will have to go some to top Series 5 in my eyes, which I consider to be unquestionably the best series of Doctor Who ever made.",0,1347011095,null,0,false,0,c64qh4d,t3_zgxfj,t1_c64qh4d,t3_zgxfj,null,1429839382,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

&gt;MissSpidey was swamped by hundreds of mentions, from hundreds of users. These tweets, as I’ve said, mocked her physical appearance as being “old” and “ugly” – in reality, she is neither. Then it took a more sinister turn, and MissSpidey found that her address had been tracked down and was being published by the “FieldMice”, who were also threatening violence. Then she started to receive death threats – Noel Fielding was, as you’d expect, copied in on much of this by the fans seeking his approval, so presumably knew what was going on. MissSpidey tried to counter the avalanche of hostility by using the official mechanisms in place for doing so: she started to block and report the users, eventually ending up suspended from Twitter for “aggressive blocking.”

and state that...

&gt;Today me and some lads were in the break room watching telly and she starts talking VERY loudly. Swearing down the phone and the rest of it. Me and the lads sort of snigger at this, and she loses her rag.

Now, I'm not trying to ""blame the victim"" but it's the fact you *can't* see how she would be upset at people basically laughing at her that seems to ring alarm bells for me. You're off to uni. I'm sure it's no secret either. It's not very hard for people to get a sense of inferiority around a person *without* them doing anything, let alone seemingly looking down on them in outward ways that the person doing the looking down seems oblivious to.

I'm going to venture that over your time there you've said or done things that gave away your internal thoughts. I worked at Pizza Hut and a bowling alley near Bermondsey before I went to uni and there were certainly people there for whom that was going to be as good as it would ever get. The last thing I would have done was intentionally lord my future prospects over them, but you will over the course of a few months, say and do thing *inadvertently* that could give that impression.

Beaverfan's first option is the right one, but even that has to be handled properly. What you don't want to do is come across as condescending, trying to explain simple logic to someone for whom it's not so simple as if it's obvious...no matter how true that actually is.

Take her aside, *away from your other workmates*, ask her why she has a problem with you. Tell her if you came across as a twat it was unintentional. You don't have to mean it, you don't have to be her mate, but you should clear the air.

If after all that she's still being a shit about it, stay weary, avoid her and keep your phone with you and fully charged so you can call the police if needed. If there's a long way home that's more crowded, go that way.

It's awfully written (perhaps deliberately) so that you could drive a bus through what it could include - but we just don't know enough. That in itself is sufficient grounds to reject the damn thing.

For example, we're still not sure whether an email that contains a non-code, written instruction within its body to ""please pass this message across to Person X"" would be classified as content, or communications data. If it's the latter, it would necessitate intrusion into each message to attempt, somehow, to scan and retrieve such instructions. At this point, encryption becomes worthwhile - but it's almost impossible for such a system to function in a way that the security services would want. It would be far easier to scrape all data than to filter out the stuff that could be lawfully accessed under the provisions within the CDB.

I've only watched through the series once (just finished watching all of them a while ago) and based on my cursory experience, I feel like Moffat is great with stories and plots but RTD is great with characters and relationships.

Edit: as for production costs etc., that's irrelevant. Of course Moffat's is going to be more flashy and realistic and stuff.

Let Lloris get back from international break get a week or two practicing with the squad so they can see who he is and then work him into the line-up.

The ""Which Cosplayers Are Hotter"" discussion doesn't come off as sexist or misogynistic to me. As a member of the Cosplay community in Los Angeles (And partially San Diego and in November Las Vegas) there's always comments on which cosplays are attractive or not. Maybe it's just the people at the conventions, it probably is, but I've definitely heard a lot worse than calling someone's cosplay hot. Especially if they're dressed as something like the main character of Black Rock Shooter or A Bikini Pikachu. I'm sure there's different boundaries for something being sexist/misogynistic in settings other than conventions, but when I think of cosplaying I think of the environment and atmosphere of a con.

1) A transparent proxy, i.e. one which handles the data at the HTTP level. These have been in use for unencrypted HTTP traffic since very early in the commercial web, usually for caching and optimistion.

2) A valid certificate for a the web site being intercepted. Valid in this sense only means that you have a certificate which claims (in the CN field) to be for the relevant domain, and has been signed by one of the many certification authorities which have a root certificate in your browser. I am fairly sure that any competent government spook department can find a way to arrange for this.

Ok, how does this play out? The interception will work fine for a while. Sooner or later someone will notice that a certificate has been signed by an unexpected CA, and some rumours go around. A few security-concious individuals delete the relevant root cert, but possibly lose access to other encrypted sites. Mozilla debates stopping distributing the root cert for the CA - there's a tradeoff on loss of access here, but there will also be the usual ""if you have nothing to hide"" argument, which might win. Internet Explorer probably does not retract the root cert. Google Chrome? Hard to know, since they are so heavily in to data mining.

The Doctor talks about being a child on Gallifrey in *The Sound of the Drums*, and it shows the time lords as children. They're 8 years old, and they look like they're 8 years old. The first doctor was ~450 (according to classic who) when he died of old age, and he looked to be ~75, maybe 80.

Time lords do age, just much much slower than humans. If I had to guess, the aging process slows over time. It took 450 years for the First Doctor to appear 75-ish, but Eleven was around for ~196 years between meeting Amy and *The Wedding of River Song* and he doesn't look like he's aged at all.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I remember reading this a while ago and forgot to reply. So here goes. 

Nearest big place is Newcastle-under-lyme which kind of runs into the next town along Stoke-on-trent. They're middle sized towns, kind of nice with sizeable student populations from Keele University and Staffordshire University, I don't really know too much about them other than that as there isn't really a need for me to go to them that much, they have all you could want though; shops, pubs, cinema etc. Nightlife in Newcastle is a bit underwhelming but it's not awful either. One of the nearby areas, Hanely, is where most of the partying goes on. Theres basically one large street with a load of clubs on and during student events periodically hosted called ""Carnage"" it's absolutely packed and the quintessential English binge-drinking piss up experience if you want that. 

I guess you'll be staying in campus accommodation which I can't really give you any information on I'm afraid as I stayed in private housing last year and this year, but I hear it's not too bad from people, I guess it depends on which block you're placed in.

The campus itself is absolutely beautiful, it's situated on top of a hill with plenty of greenery and is most certainly not a concrete jungle like other campuses I've seen. The facilities are brilliant, the Student Union building has just been renovated and should be much better than last year. Which is good considering the Union is where most people go on their nights out, the drinks are cheap and the atmosphere is good due to it being full of your peers. 


General tips; If you've been on a night out at the Union they run a service called Night Bus (I think it's called that) that picks you up from outside the union and runs you back to wherever you want to, basically a student operated free taxi service. Pretty useful. 

There are convenience stores on campus that will sell food etc, but in my experience they can be pretty pricey, which isn't too bad if you just want to pick up a bottle of wine or some chips or something but if you're shopping in bulk there's a large supermarket in Newcastle called: Morrisons. Which if you can get down there in a taxi between 4 of you the savings you'll make on a full shop are pretty big. 

Things to do: Stoke is pretty slap bang in the middle of Birmingham and Manchester, two very large cities with plenty to do. I'd recommend trying to get to one of them at least once while you're here, I've heard Birmingham is nice but being a northener myself I can't attest to that, so go to Manchester!

As others have said, Alton Towers is a really good day out and if you time it properly (avoiding school holidays) the queues are absolutely negligable. 

Other than that I don't know what else to say, I hope you enjoy your time here. I had a blast in my first year and suspect you'll have the same. There's quite a large amount of foreign students from North America here I've found and there's also a International Students society for support, I know the guy who runs it and he's a really nice guy and I know he'll do a good job of running it. PM me if you want any more details or specific questions, and likewise when you get here just PM me if you're feeling a bit overwhelmed or anything.

true,ShinyJaker,num8,,"a) The stature of our club does not matter. Clubs like United and Barce, the worlds's elite, use the strategy of buying players young and training them to work within in the system. b) That doesn't really make sense - just because we bought him for a different role doesn't change the fact we converted him to one of the world's elite deep lying playmakers. c) That's a flat out lie. We put in a £20+m bid for Moutinho; Eriksen would cost less than that (look at the fees paid for Suarez, Vertonghen and Anitia).

You're right, it's not easy to turn AMCs in to deep-lying playmakers; only certain players will adapt. However, the likes of Kroos, Pirlo, Montilivio and Scholes are all recent examples that show that it is entirely possible. Ericksen has exceptional passing range and creativity, and is a hard worker (certainly when compared to your average true attacking midfielder). These are probably the most important aspects to a deep lying playmaker's game. Defensively, yes, he is suspect, but Pirlo and Scholes aren't exactly known for their hollywood tackles. And he is just 20, so has plenty of time to adapt and grow as a player.

The reason that you rarely see top class AMs being retrained into DMs is because it would limit their usefulness. Player such as Snijder and Kaka are great at shooting and scoring, so are therefore obviously much more use higher up the pitch. Conversely, shooting is one of Erisken's weakest points (managing less than 10 goals a season despite playing in the generally defensively weak Eredivise).

Of course there are also players like Ozil or Pastore who are exceptional dribblers and masterful at through balls; hence capable of playing a killer pass or dribble. Now this is a category which Erisken does fit; his dribbling is very good, and as are his through balls (though obviously not on the same level as the 2 aforementioned players). However, there is one key element which sets Eriksen apart here; his willingness to track back, and work hard for the team. Both Pastore and Ozil stay high up the pitch, drifting around the ""hole"" or moving in to channels when of the ball to ensure they're able to recieve the ball and instantly use their skill and pace to push forward. Eriksen, however, drops deeper and helps out his midfield when Ajax loose the ball, highlighting his willingness to work for the team. This, coupled with the fact that he has in the past played as a CM for both Ajax and Denmark leads me to believe that he could certainly be converted into a good deep-laying playmaker.

Yeah, someone put out a press release... 

&gt; What we have is scripted journalism not really a free journalism; the narrative is still tightly controlled by the old military powers.

What we have is free journalism and a lot of press agencies happy to work on the basis of almost any press release.  Unless you are suggesting that these outlets were forced to report? Or forced to report in a certain way...

&gt;If they were honest the would be explicit with who took the photos, who wrote the script.

John Stilwell of the Press Association took the photos and made them available to everyone who wanted them.. It says so under the photographs.  The BBC seem to have shot their own video.. The text is written by whoever wrote it, likely based on a release or a briefing.  There isn't a script.

&gt;There will be a persona management company in their some where.

I'm sure there is, but that doesn't mean this isn't a story or that people are being coerced into reporting it (or colluding to do so).  It simply means that it's a story and there aren't a whole hell of a lot of ways to do the initial reporting.  I'm sure there will be any number of analysis pieces that cover the idea of him doing it due to his reputation (or to get him out of the limelight..), some will ask whether the Vegas trip was a pre-deployment blow out etc..

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; because of false information being provided isn't an indication of somebody's ability to handle money.

This isn't really the issue with PPI. I used to work sales for a bank in the UK, and worked PPI (ended up being the reason I left) for a couple of years. The sales pitches are all closely scripted - every word goes through dozens of iterations between the banks legal reps, sales, and the FSA. Usually, the FSA would provide something like a 25 page script (which, obviously nobody would ever listen to, so no products would get sold) that comprised all of the details they decided were important. The bank would then argue on as much of it as possible. This takes a long time, eventually weening it down to a page or two. 

This means that when people are sold PPI, in 99% of cases they are told everything they need to know. Any employees that provide false information *will* be found out, and will suffer as a result. Calls are monitored and assessed such that an adviser competency can be rated - things like accuracy, politeness etc are all taken into account. This is done on random calls, several times each month - and the bonus the adviser receives (and indeed if they get one at all) is based on that. There is a massive disincentive to lie to customers from the advisers point of view. 

So, the issue with PPI is instead with the one area that was not completely defined with the product, the place where there was wiggle room for interpretation. The FSA said that the insurance could only be sold if there was a *need* - so the bank wonders what constitutes a need? Circumstances are assessed individually, so in one situation an individual might *need* the product, but another in a very similar case doesn't. These grey areas are what cause the problems.

Essentially, the banks stretched (immorally) those that encompass the group that *need* the product. So, the adviser asks how you can pay your loan or credit card if you lose your job. If you can't/don't give an answer - then you *need* the product. The bank will say they want security on their money. Or, they might ask ""how will your loan be settled if you die?"" ""I dunno"" ""well, best set up PPI"". Finally, ""how would you pay the bill if you lose your job?"" ""my girlfriend would pay it"" ""what if you split up? then you can't guarantee payment?"" Technically, it was seen as valid by the bank. Part of the problem is that the circumstance in which the PPI is being set up is not conducive to determining a true need - you are not doing a full financial assessment etc. 

Finally, I'm not saying that everybody listens and completely comprehends everything they're told on the phone - but the FSA are part of the decision process in determining the language you use with the customer. Often times they just plain won't listen, and will give incorrect responses that set them up for (what can be determined later) an inappropriate sale. For instance, many sales come from people just blindly agreeing to whatever is being said. If it turns out that person has a big pile of savings (and so they have no problem paying off a £2k credit card) then they were sold PPI inappropriately, not necessarily through the fault of the bank.

If I told you there is a threat that you could drown in a puddle of water, would you consider that justification to ban puddles?

Of course not, because the risk is so small compared to the difficulty of enacting the ban that it would be a stupid thing to do.

In all things, you weigh up the balance of evidence one way or the other and come to a conclusion based in the risks as they are understood at the time. A wise council is to then keep the matter under review - and that is exactly what they have recommended here.

Off topic slightly, but I find it curious that those claiming lab tests are sufficient evidence to ban pesticides are often the same people saying that lab tests are insufficient when it comes to permitting GM crops.

&gt;Look at the factoids that they are all pushing. Take the BBC we have a so called ""analysis"" side section with the following... That is lifted straight from this press release because it appears everywhere.

Yeah, it probably is, it's sloppy reporting, but it is a story.

&gt;The UK has such a free press that only the Conservatives and Labour are ""viable"" governments, and in living memory it hasn't been any other way. 

That has a lot to do with the fact in the UK the electoral system makes it incredibly hard to make an impact outside of a local area and that the 'big three' parties have solid baseline support, something that takes smaller parties decades to build up.  If you think it's about the press, you are partly wrong, it's also about the fact that turnout is low and people vote against as much as they vote for.

&gt;You seem to be a PPUK affiliate, so you should realise why the political environment is so such a homogenous central extremism.

Which is why I am pretty certain that even with the problems that we have with journalism in the UK, there isn't some overarching conspiracy.  It wouldn't be credible to make that claim, not without some decent evidence to support it.

&gt;You have a strong opinion. I challenge you to look into the links between these so called independent publishers: who owns who, who's parent company owns what else, who's sat on each others boards, who sat on each others board last year, who established these companies, what the type of owner looks like, and so on.

Tell you what, you seem to have already done it, lets see a write up, if you can do a convincing job of putting it together in a sourced way, I'm sure I can get it out to the world.  The problem of course is that there isn't any evidence to support massive collusion between the major media outlets (there is too much concentration in TV, and with some news gathering..) but it doesn't impinge on press freedom.

So if you see a sharp change in University ranking, either positive or negative, most likely nothing happend. A better way to few these figures is to average them over a ten year period.

To me that sounds like he had admitted his guilt in *this* case earlier in the proceedings (given that this article is concerned with the sentencing rather than conviction itself), rather than ""he has plead guilty to previously setting fire to another flat and crimes of reckless endangerment"" which is how I think you're reading the article.

I'm more inclined to believe he is a victim of unfortunate circumstance than a serial arsonist in the making.

Also...

&gt; ...Ferrier had gone down with another man to have a look. They had cigarettes and Ferrier had discarded his ""by flicking it through into the kitchen area"".

&gt; When he realised he had set fire to rubbish in the flat, he ran upstairs and tried to evacuate the building.

Credit where credit is due; he didn't bolt, he didn't abscond, according to his solicitor he made an attempt to evacuate the building so prevent a loss of life.

The charges are confirmed, the Grand Jury is an unconfirmed leak.  The grand Jury is brought up in almost every article relating to extradition, but not every article (where they aren't discussing the extradition).

&gt;Find the special editorials condemning rape apologists, then try and find the special editorials on the Guardian about the Grand Jury.

Well there's [this](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/03/evidence-us-judicial-vendetta-wikileaks-activists-mounts).. But the point there is that an MP a president of a country and various other idiots in the US claiming that rape isn't really rape sometimes is a story in itself...  Of course it's going to get reported on, the suggestions made were outrageous.  The grand jury claim is discussed and at length in various places, if it is ever confirmed it will be a massive story in it's own right too..

&gt;The Assange affair is another example of this concert of behaviour. You'll find across multiple publishers stories connecting Galloway, Akin and Assange. Am I meant to believe that was a coincidence?

What, right after Galloway put together a 5 minute video on why Assange didn't rape anyone and that it was a CIA conspiracy, the same weekend that Akin decided to term some rapes as justified? That isn't a coincidence, it's reporting.  Or are you suggesting that Galloway and Akin are also working in concert with the press to discredit Assange?

&gt;You'll have to define conspiracy.

It was definitely underhand and, on top of that, much of telesales is unfortunately about underhand tricks anyway. ""So I'll just set that up for you, send out all of the details in the post and you can read it at your leisure?"" is a typical underhand way to ask for confirmation to activate a product. Instead of thinking they're accepting the product (direct confirmation is also needed, but this goes a long way to securing it) people think ""of course i would rather get it in the post where i can ignore it, than have you talk to me about it for another 20 minutes.. go for it"". 

&gt; offering free advice

This is one more thing that is interesting about the PPI case. The individuals that sell it are not insurance brokers. They are not allowed to give advice. If someone asks ""should I take this product?"" they, legally, cannot answer. Instead, the role of the agent in this case is simply to provide information and let the customer make a decision. But, it is a very cleverly guided decision. 

&gt; Shame bank workers (or bosses) are more concerned with profit than fairness.

It is. A real shame. The line I worked on was pure sales - the worst part of it was that the customers calling didn't realise they were calling to speak to a sales advisor. They were calling about something that was an issue manufactured by the bank to create a point of contact for sales. We were given all sorts of crazy targets - minimum 3 product approaches per call, percentage and nightly targets for each of the products (about 6-7 products at any one time). The bank pretend that they support their staff, and pretend to themselves that they are providing a service (the way they see it is that the customer doesn't know about all the great products they have, so better tell them!).

true,ajehals,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;Good lord, if this is the alternative thinking that the PPUK attracts then what a shit enterprise that is going to be.

I'd like to see a lot of changes in how the press works, a lot of things that should be reported don't get the attention they deserve and a lot of the time it is easy for an industry, company, state or individual to set the tone of reporting by getting their story out first.  That doesn't mean the press isn't free to report on what it wants.  The press face all sorts of pressures, but one of the biggest right now is simply filling column inches and dumping reports out as quickly and as cheaply as possible, that really is problematic.  It means that there is less effort and less truly investigative reporting.  What it doesn't mean is that it is being done intentionally to present a particular agenda, it certainly doesn't mean that such activity is being orchestrated.

&gt;There isn't a thing called the US media nor a UK media. The head of BBC now works for the NYT and the second link is to Bashir, who has worked for the BBC, ITV and so on.

Yes, there is such a thing as national media.  Because the news that is read in the UK isn't the same as the news being read in the US.  Reporting standards and methods are different, there is more control of media in the US and more compliance.  That's borne out by relative ratings of press freedoms and legislation (we have issues with defamation law, the US uses access and intimidation).

&gt;What you have is a class of people acting in concert at the very least. There are links everywhere especially around military objectives, Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel, and so on. These links go right back to institutions involved with propaganda from the first world war onwards.

No, you have people who work in the same field having links to one another and some similarities in pressures and practices.  What you don't have is a (now apparently global) conspiracy.

&gt;They are forced (whether consciously, unconsciously or systemically) to report in a certain way, because in Harry's case they have reported in a certain way. This behaviour is not atypical.

They aren't forced to report in a certain way, they tend to report in a similar way because they are all trying to do the same thing, get stories out quickly and cheaply.  Again, that doesn't imply that there is a conspiracy or that people are working within the media to push an agenda.  Of course there is manipulation from anyone who has an agenda, everyone tries to get the media to report in a certain way, everyone issues press releases and hopes that their take will get picked up and turned into a story.  That doesn't imply the press isn't free to report how it wants.  The press does criticise government, constantly. It does have an impact on elections, it does unearth nasty stories that take down major political and corporate players and it can does have incestuous relationships with power and celebrity.  None of that is great, some of it could be limited (by regulating.. which arguably would make the press less free...), but you can't tell me that the press are working in concert to deliver a particular agenda to the public on the orders of either governments or some other power.

TPS works by supplying UK based businesses who conduct cold calling a list of phone numbers not to call, and they are obliged not to call if you are on that list. TPS does not have the power to tell foreign companies not to call you though.  Nor does anyone have a list of every phone number on the planet which may originate a cold sales call, so the phone companies here can't block.

true,elshiz,flair8,,"Our stature, ambitions and the expectations on the club are absolutely vital to our transfer policy.  You mention two incredibly rich clubs in United and Barca who of course *are* capable of dropping £20m+ on a prospect.  It is clear our finances are far more limited and a £20m+ player at spurs simply must become a key member of the team immediately and fill an existing need of the team.  We simply can't spend that on an AMC in the hope of retraining him when we have 2 fantastic players in that position already.  

I'm not doubting Eriksen's skill, ability or potential.  The main thread of my argument is that it is highly underestimated how easily he would be able to 'drop in' to a deeper position; it is not an easy transition.  One who believes that Eriksen's skillset allows him to replace Modric fairly easily severely understates Modric's defensive and tactical contributions to the team.  

Agreed the last para was tenuous but to me this Eriksen argument is a tired fantasy.  He is in the same bracket of player and potential as Oscar and Lucas Moura.  The difference is that Eriksen has shown his ability in the Champion's League.  I find it *very* difficult to believe Ajax will let him go for less than £30m.  That seems to be out of our price range and at any rate, he will have far bigger clubs offering far higher wages for his services when he leaves.  He won't come to us, we don't need him, and I highly doubt that the club has seriously targeted him at any point.

&gt;This must be the 5th time I've talked about the Suarez/Borini positional issue this week, I wish JHI could be launched earlier so I can post the damn article.

&gt;This might not be orthodox, but I have a very strong feeling that Rodgers playing Borini on the right and Suarez in the center has a lot to do with options and movement.

&gt;Suarez is very good with his control. He can pass, can shoot (technically), and turn defenders or dribble his way through.

&gt;Borini is relatively fast, loads of stamina, hardworking, has pretty good movement off-the-ball, and quite good defensively in his pressing (he was a little disappointing against Arsenal, but he had the same number of interceptions during the City game as Allen)

&gt;Suarez is being played in the middle because theoretically he provides a lot more options than Borini. He can lay the ball off, he can get past the defender, or he can turn and shoot. Borini starting in the center would mean losing the option of getting past the man. He can lay the ball off, of course, but he isn't the sort to beat the man.

&gt;Borini is supposed to cut in from the flanks and switch positions with Suarez. Suarez is supposed to have the options of passing it to either him or Gerrard, or run down the right, or hold the ball and let Borini's movement mess up the opposing defensive shape. Borini is pretty good at break offside traps, almost every goal he scored for Roma was from hanging off a defenders' shoulder. Being on the right(or preferably left) gives him more space and a diagonal line to run onto.

&gt;In situations when the ball is on the left, Suarez is supposed to drop to the edge of the box for the pass, again giving him space to dribble, shoot or pass. Borini is the one who's supposed to move into the box.

&gt;Now there are a few reasons why this isn't working right now.

&gt;1. This style works much better if Borini is on the left, with his right foot his stronger one. However, Borini is better on the right than Sterling, who lacks the ability to properly move inwards on the right. Sterling is much better on the left than on the right.

&gt;2. Once Assaidi comes in, Borini will likely play more on the left.

&gt;3. Suarez isn't yet used to his teammates' movements for this position, and he is too used to putting his head down and trying to get past the centerback. This is a waste of Borini's movement. He's too impatient to get the attack going all by himself.

&gt;4. Gerrard has been playing out of his position. In the 4-3-3, the attacking midfielder isn't the box-to-box that Gerrard is used to, its a false 9 who's supposed to be the 2nd striker. Gerrard is supposed to do what he used to do with Torres, where he hung very close to him, but he has been dropping back for the ball too often. This means that when the ball reaches Suarez, Gerrard is either too far away thus eliminating a passing option, or Gerrard is in full flight thus the attack cannot be controlled. In addition, Gerrard has been reverting to his Hail Mary passes when things start to go wrong or when he starts to lose his patience.

&gt;If you listened to Rodgers' post-match conference, he mentioned the major problem to be decision-making. Once the team is not only more familiar with where they are supposed to be, but also where their teammates are supposed to be, the options will start to open up.",0,1347027373,null,0,false,0,c64sp7p,t3_zi5ku,t1_c64sp7p,t1_c64sfhi,null,1429840428,15,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,15

I've been wearing contact lenses for 15 years so I've been through various type and various opticians. 

High street opticians like boots, Specsavers and D&amp;amp;A are very over priced. In my case they charge twice as much as it costs to buy online. 

The only snag is you need a valid prescription to buy contact lenses online. The best option I have found is to use ASDA's service, the lenses are as cheap as you'll find them online and if you buy online you'll get your prescript/after care free. 

As for types, it's personal. If you have an astigmatism you'll find your choice a little more limited/expensive as you have to by 'weighted' toric lenses. 

After then it's up to your preference. Daily disposables are all the rage at the moment. Though I find they get dry and uncomfortable after a full day so I personally have the ones you can sleep in but I take them out at night to keep them fresh.

When Who returned in 2005, I watched the first episode with nostalgia-tinted skepticism. Would this be anything like the paper mache monsters or rubber suits I remember from my childhood?

I was hooked from the first scene with Christopher Eccleston. The line, ""Nice to meet you, Rose Tyler. **Run for your life!**"" was amazing. His anger that he had inside was new, but there were glipses of the silly doctor I knew and loved.

From the first moment I saw David Tennant, I wasn't sure how he would work out. [for OP](#s ""then again, that was for approximately one second at first since I had to wait for the Christmas special"") He grew on me, and then when he left, I had to adjust again.

I have since gone back and watched some of the classic Who with other doctors, and can really get an appreciation for many of them, but 9, 10, and 11 have a natural feeling flow of progression.

If you were to go and register a limited company today to trade, you would most likely create a limited by shares company - that isn't the case here, there are no shareholders. They're within a whisker of being a political party or charity.

They're also claiming 900,000 members in that report. That's nearly 4 times the membership of the 3 leading UK Political Parties combined.

My reading of the accounts (as a director of a limited company, but not one who is awesome with reading accounts), is that as of 30 Sept they simply had £500k cash on hand they could spend as they wished. They'd spent £636k on running the outfit, £162k of which was staff costs.

That £1 million in donations is interesting though. Individuals gave them £974,971 from 42,186 donators. They list all individuals who donated more than £7,500 - Gordon Roddick, Henry Tinsley, Esmee Fairbairn Foundation, The Sheepdrove Trust, Barrow Cadbury Fund and Isvara Foundation. I don't recognise any of those names, but I'm curious at doing some research into them now.

I'm surprised nobody has started to dig a little deeper here: they're claiming incredible membership numbers, donations most political parties would die for, they're interested in campaigning politically and claim influence on the BSkyB bid, the NHS review, and public woodlands sell-offs, and yet we don't know anything about them, nor do the Electoral Commission know anything about them!

You're right.  It does.

And it's not even an original sentiment; it's been around as long as there have been fans of anything.

There are always the fans who perceive themselves to be the ""real fans"" - no matter how delicately and even kindly they may try to phrase it - and that other group, which they refer to (or at least, think about) as the ""lesser fans""; the newcomers, the posers, the ones who aren't so-called true fans and aren't as good at being fans as the so-called old-timers perceive themselves to be.

And y'know what, anyone is free to think whatever they want, that's your prerogative, but there's one thing you need to remember:

**It's those new fans who keep the thing you like going.**

It's that new influx of fresh blood, new viewpoints, and brand-new rah-rah-OMG-I-Love-This-Thing! fervor that keeps any fandom going, past the point where the ""real fans"" have seen it all, done it all, memorized every line of dialogue, and spend their nights arguing about whether the main character is a Scorpio or a Sagittarius based upon the position of the moon and the stars as seen in the third episode of the fourth season at precisely twelve minutes and forty-eight seconds in.

And it's the fresh blood that keeps the networks and the advertisers interested, and funding new episodes, when the ""real fans"" are too busy having tedious debates about just exactly *how far downhill* the thing has slid since the heyday of whatever time period THEY were all rah-rah gung-ho about it.

So people can be as snobbish and pretentious (or not) as they want about being a ""true fan"" or a ""real fan"" or even merely a ""long-time fan"", and that is just fine, because it is **irrelevant**.  Because it doesn't matter how long you've been enamored of your whatever-it-is - it's not you, but that brand-new guy or girl who just burst in all OMG-THIS-IS-AWESOME who matters.

Right up until the moment that person starts saying the hipster bit themselves, about whoever's just come bursting through the door during the next season.

true,mao_was_right,cnty-wales,poverty,"I completely agree. People in favour of this kind of legislation often base their arguments around the fact that organ donation is a good thing for people to do (and it is), and various appeals to emotion (which is itself a fallacy). But if you take this emotional aspect out of the debate for a moment, as you are supposed to do when writing legislation, it's a civil liberties issue.

I have absolutely no problem with donating my organs. What I do have a problem with is the state deciding such things for me because it believes it knows better than I when it comes to my own personal decisions. I don't like the idea that I have to ask a government department for permission to decide what to do with my own remains. 

Imagine, for a moment, that these organs weren't going to be transplanted into human hospital patients, but thrown into a grinder (with the rest of your body) to be turned into dog food for RSPCA kennels, or fertiliser for crops. Again, I personally wouldn't be that bothered, but the essence of the act is the same and you can bet that far less people would be so forthcoming with the government to do what they like with you.

Secondly, and something which vaguely irks me over the debate in these comments - 'Yeah, but you can opt out so it's okay' is anything but okay. Weren't you guys arguing the complete opposite when it came to the proposed opt-out internet porn filter? About how the government shouldn't be automatically assuming the intentions of their tens of millions of citizens?

Asking 'Well why wouldn't you?' is irrelevant. People have their own reasons for their life (or in this case, death) choices and it's no one else's prerogative to enquire why.

true,Kinths,kunkka,Kunkka,"If you have played LoL then you will have most of the basics. 

You basically just need to learn to use the courier, what new buildings there are and obviously relearn the heroes and items. The meta is in a high state of flux atm so there is nothing truly solid to it. Though as you probably have realised in games that newer players just run 2 top 1 mid and 2 bot. Jungling isn't quite as important here, it's more a means of getting another hero to level up faster than planning ganks giving out buffs etc. (No buffs in Dota jungle) In higher levels of play people go all over the bloody map. Things like Tri-lanes, dual roam etc are viable here. It never just sticks to one certain Meta.

I think the most important thing to learn coming from LoL is just how important mana is and just how easy it is for a fight to be turned around. just because someone has less than a quarter health doesn't mean you can sit and eat damage from them because you think they are only 1 or two hits away from death. So many players make this mistake and end up dying.

Supports tend to be more aggressive instead of Carry babysitters. They roam and can easily get kills. Support in Dota is generally defined by them not needing much gold to be good and less by what abilities they have.

Every hero is viable in most roles, except maybe support. The heroes in Dota are not built for specific roles, they have icons telling you what roles they are best in but they can do other things.  You may have noticed the long lanes as well. To lane for radiant and bottom lane for Dire are long lanes(suicide lanes) the river is not perfectly diagonal. Long lanes extend into the enemies territory. 

Most importantly if you're a rager or elitist curb that behaviour now. No reason to get mad when you lose in Dota because you get the same amount of battle points whether you win or lose and there is nothing to grind for. If you get reported too many times you will end up in the low priority pool and trust me you never ever, ever want to go there. It's where all the ragers and game quitters go, it has 30 minute ques as well. Think 300 Elo in LoL but everyone who was there was put there because they rage or rage quit.

Better for Lloris to find a house, get his kids (?) in school, and everything else sorted, then win the job from Friedel.

I can see Lloris starting in the League Cup match on the 26th (and possibly in the Europa Cup matches), however IMO Friedel will definitely be in goal for the Man United, Villa and Chelsea matches. I could then see Lloris getting a good run of games (A-Maribor, A-S'ton, Wigan, Maribor) leading up to the Manchester City away match.

It just felt forced coming from her. I definitely think things could have been written much better, and that it could have been made believable if they had, for example, developed her character to have sort of this overly flirtatious personality, but for that to be revealed as being more about her own insecurities, or something along those lines. Nothing especially creative, but still I think more interesting than what we got.

Personally, I liked her character a lot towards the beginning, but I slowly grew far more fond or Rory than I ever was of Amy (especially after the Pandorica saga of course). I still enjoy her character but she's just not as interesting as I've come expect a companion to be, and I don't think she stacks up that well (especially alone) against past companions.

But this time his role is likely going to be deep within the Camp Bastion fence, I'm guessing in some sort of Operations Room role. With perhaps a couple of chances at taking the Apache on a run for the cameras (Got to show good face after Vegas ah?) and only after a carefully planned operation, with all ground covered for potential combatants. No chance the Army would allow a Prince to be assassinated by Terry Taliban. I have no illusions the Prince's safety is going to be compromised as a result of us knowing of his arrival.

I'm posting here as Winbar isn't a redditor and doesn't understand this whole upvoting, downvoting, narwhal, bacon, karma stuff! So to pretty much quote Winbar's post on the Steam group:

I'm one of the guys behind epic.LAN. We've just moved venues and we're planning our tournaments for next year starting with our February event, and are keen to add a MOBA title to our tournament lineup.

We obviously have a well-established event with around 400 people attending so it would save any of you the hassle of having to organise your own if we picked up DotA 2 as a title.

Anyway, we're keen to hear from you, if anybody wants to chat with me about it, drop us an email using www.epiclan.co.uk/contact and we can throw some ideas around!

I loved a lot of Moffat's character in his single episodes. I guess we'll just have to see what he does with this season. Whether I really love it or not, I'm sure I'll enjoy the show as much as I always have, but my expectations this time around are far more in check than they were last time around.

I liked Donna mostly because she was a nice change of pace from previous companions. Aside from being really funny at times, I never really related to her that much though. She's actually my least favorite long term companion so far I think. Although that's not saying much because I think they've all been really great, flaws and all.

A lot of people say the same things about Rose (my favorite companion so far) that they say about Amy. I always felt like while Rose's character was definitely ""simple"" in a certain sense, but she was a much more nuanced sort of simple. She was definitely a simple-minded girl, but she had a real depth and range of emotion that was believable.

EDIT: Also, with Amy, I didn't even really believe she was in love with The Doctor at all. It always seemed like just a passing crush with her.

The only thing they had was the whole ""she met him when she was a little girl"" but I don't think Amy's character has the emotional depth to do anything with all of the Doctor's inner-turmoil, and his conflicted nature. She needs a Rory who will love her unconditionally and be the guy who keeps all the attention on her. It would be like if Rose had chosen Mickey instead of The Doctor.

 I am aware he is nowhere near as defensively competent as Luka; but not all deeplying playmakers are (as I mentioned before, Scholes, Kroos and Pirlo are all fairly suspect). With us switching to a 4-3-3, he extra man in midfield means that Eriksen would have lessened defensive responsibility anyway. You also seem to ingore the fact that Eriksen has played deeper on the odd occasion before, showing he can cope with the changed role.

I agree that he's an unlikely target, and that there are better options, but you can simply trivialise it as an idea, if only in terms of discussion.

true,ajehals,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;I'd continue this but speech isn't free, it's cost me 120+ karma in about 20 minutes (and counting), and a severe disability to post in this sub-reddit.#

Last I checked, Karma didn't cost anything, although I appreciate it has an impact on people reading this discussion.

&gt;In many ways the conspiracy is in everybody's head. Just as a kid doesn't know whether to play with the toy or the cardboard box, he has to be taught the correct narrative to understand what he is supposed to do. The same goes for politics (of which journalism is a subset). I don't believe ""counter-subversion vetting"" ever went away.

So what you are saying is that the agenda, is in fact the application of social norms to journalism? i.e. that the press can report whatever they want, are indeed free, don't face any consorted external pressure, but instead restrain themselves by using (mostly) the same standards that everyone else does? If you are saying that, I totally agree, but that is very different from some notion of counter-subversion vetting in a formal sense, or the suppression of news in an organised fashion.  

&gt;To address one point. If the media ""hasn't the time"" to do the right thing and is reliant on upstream providers of information (call this a journalistic subsidy), then that is the ""conspiracy"" if you insist on using that word. 

In which case it is simply a matter of the press being free and generally acting freely, but you disagreeing with them when they do regurgitate a press release without checking it over first, or applying a different narrative to it..  Again, that happens now with more regularity because of the web and the pace of information exchange, but it also happened 70 years ago when a journalist interviewed a housewife, or a butcher.  

&gt;Those with the connections and finance to create and push out prefabricated ostiers have de facto control over the media.

No they don't.  A very large group of competing people, with different agendas are all trying to push the media to favour them, sometimes one group has a success, sometimes a different group does.  That doesn't imply control.  It would be a bit like suggesting that when you go shopping and buy some new flavour of heinz soup you saw on TV, that you are under the control of heinz, because you were somehow induced to make a decision because of an external influence.

&gt;In the case of Harry, it proves that some institutions have a supra-national influence and a single ""press event"" can be executed with military precision. 

It means that a shed load of people are interested in what the Royals do.  You could replace Harry with your celebrity of choice, a footballer or a particularly photogenic turnip, if people are interested in it, the press will print it.  That's essentially the determining factor here, public interest, in the common sense, rather the legal one.

&gt;We didn't just have one press release, we had multiple organisations deliberately hiding their sources, a coordination of front pages, and agreeing to an embargo (~11am today).

Again, this is pretty absurd.  Take the ACTA decision from this year, I was responsible for putting a press release out on that and having some people stand by to talk to the press, that ended up being quoted in various national newpapers.  Our release went out within 10 minutes (either side) of every news agency in the world reporting on it... We said some of the same stuff that various organisations said and our quotes were taken by a number of press organisations.  But it wasn't coordinated, it was lots of disparate groups trying to get something out as soon as possible.  

Now, on sources, they aren't hidden, it's a pool photograph and most of the articles have a journalists name on, they may be regurgitating a press release, but they are still writing the story, that would be the same whether they did lots of investigating or not.

&gt;An ""interesting"" piece of information is that the girl claiming to have frolicked naked with has been charged with cheque fraud committed in 2003.

Is that interesting? I'm probably not the right person to comment (because I'm not that interested in the whole story..), but why should anyone care that the person a royal cavorted with committed a crime (a stupidly common one that in some states is akin to writing a cheque and having it bounce..) almost a decade ago, when Harry was all of 19?

&gt;After WW2 ash WW1 there were a lot of military personel trained in propaganda. Where did there drift to? Journalism, telecommunications and publishing. One shouldn't be surprised by the hierarchy, divisions and specialisation that exists with in a publishing company.

See it's this jump, this utter bollocks, with no backing, no evidence and frankly a flagrant misunderstanding of what propaganda is that is so hard to swallow.  Yes, the techniques seen in propaganda are now used in advertising, they are now things we see from corporate as well as state actors.  In fact, we see these skills all the time, they are now no longer just the domain of the military and, there is no suggestion that there is now a link with the military or the state.  

I would point out that propaganda and attempts to foster support of it's actions by the state still happen, they happen whenever a minister talks to the press, or a political party releases a press release.  They happen when the Army advertises and any number of things.  However it isn't a coordinated effort by some overarching group to control the media and, importantly, the media are not under control.  There is no evidence to support that, none.

&gt;If you look to the CNNi scandal there is serious money to be made regarding narrative control, what we have are mercenaries like M&amp;C Saatchi employed to allow very rich people to own the historical record.

Yeah, we have an issue, there are PR agencies, reputation management companies, people wanting positive spin on investments and companies, all sorts.  We also have economic attacks (talking down whole regional economies to harm confidence etc..).  But it isn't all coming from one group, nor is it all successful.

&gt;I'm pretty sure every major publisher in the UK has serious conflicts of interest.

I'm sure they have some but I am also sure that in most cases a large juicy story will do more for their bottom lines than pleasing an advertiser.

&gt; At the BBC the head has close links to private health care, the Guardian at the Scott trust level has board members tied with BBC, Channel4 and even Rochschild investment group. The Telegraph has the (non-dom) Barclay Brothers as owners, the Dailymail has (non dom) Viscount Rothmere.

So what does that actually suggest? Currently you have a rotating governor of the BBC trust having links with a company.. I didn't realise the BBC was shilling for private healthcare, in fact it isn't.. The BBC governors don't have editorial control, most boards of publishers don't.  If you take this line of reasoning to it's logical conclusion you end up in a mess, you can't trust anyone or anything any more.

There is nothing in what you are suggesting here to indicate the conclusions you are coming to, you are essentially taking a couple of things that really aren't that problematic, ignoring the things that are, and implying that there is control of the media by some specific group.

&gt;What isn't important is what is covered in the press, but what is repeated.

No, that's just a saying you've made up to sound profound.  That the press don't ignore important stories because they are facing pressure is important, that people know about scandals and illegal or unscrupulous actions is important.  That happens, whether the target is the US or UK government, some corporate, a major or minor royal or some minor celebrity.",0,1347036979,null,0,false,0,c64v6lf,t3_zi05l,t1_c64v6lf,t1_c64um48,null,1429841597,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I understand the need for an investigation.  In fact, if this happened in the USA, there would also be an investigation.  Contrary to some opinions that I've seen from UK Redditors (not necessarily you), every shooting in the USA, that the police know about, gets investigated.

My question is, why is the arrest necessary?  If there was obvious evidence at the scene that implied that the farmer had done something wrong (such as the burglar being shot in the back or something similar), then I would understand it.  However, if there is no such evidence, then why arrest him?  Is the police really concerned that this farmer is going to leave the country or go into hiding?  The police already know the farmer's name and where he lives.  I wouldn't really expect finding him to be a problem.

I seem to have had an opposite experience in terms of the community. I only got a dota 2 key about 2 weeks ago (played dota 1 for a while though) and I have yet to actually see any rage.

Britain doesn't have free speech really because some voices are just that loud, and there is conditioning to really go after people who step outside agreed norms and break taboos.)

Reddit is a US based site, the downvotes are from people who think that you are posting nonesense or are wrong, but as your account gets older, the restrictions do fall away.. It isn't about silencing you, it's about preventing spam and trolling.

&gt;Let's get one thing straight:

&gt;Normal press releases radiate, Prince Harry was an instant creation at 11am, on masse. Are you telling me that a press release went out and every publication took the exact same time to do the write up - from opening the email, to delegating the writer, to proof reading, to sub editor, to pressing the publish button? 

Press releases can get embargoed, but even when they aren't I absolutely think that it is entirely possible that a release went out and every publication released at *around* the same time.  Or are you suggesting that this collusion is being orchestrated by idiots to the point where slightly varying release times isn't considered?  The PPUK press team aims to issue a release on something urgent within 15 minutes (and that's with entirely new material..), a newsdesk will take a PR off the wire and deal with it in minutes (often republishing a wire service report with minor modifications). If you know there is going to be an announcement (as with ACTA or Assange) you can be even quicker, I think my best turnaround time is 7 minutes, that included multi-source verification.

But of course it may have been embargoed, in which case the release would come at a particular time, embargoes on press releases are stupidly common and again, not a sign of control...

&gt;This is blatantly untrue at least for the words. Who wrote the original press release? 

Why does it matter who wrote the press release if someone else is writing an article based upon it? 

&gt;Who for that matter writes any article on the BBC? 

Someone at the BBC presumably, the video they took appears to have been shot by them too.  Again, this really doesn't have any relevance to control of the media.

&gt;Why not have a royal site to publish? Why do it through every single major publisher? This story actually shows you which papers have 'royal assent' and those that don't. 11am was a clear embargo for a certain set of players, every one else was playing catchup at about 12pm.

It might show that certain publications (looking at it, the major UK press...) got advanced access, is that a problem? The Royals wanted something out in the press, had a story, invited some press round and got their story. It could have been the Labour party, a musician, a corporate etc.. the chances of being listened to will be pretty tightly linked to how interesting you are to the newspapers.  It's not control of the media, it's control of what information you can control and every state, every company, every voluntary organisation and every person does that.  The difference here is impact.

&gt;If you didn't know this actually happened at least up to the mid eighties. Anyone having worked at the BBC in that time was an approved person politically.

Yeah, the state owned broadcaster used the security service for vetting.  The BBC then used some of that information to decide who got jobs and who got promoted..  That's fairly nasty of the BBC.  They stopped in the 80's. 

&gt; I have to presume it happens to this day, 

There doesn't seem to be anything to support that, but OK.

&gt;I know it happens in telecoms where companies have to designate persons for security clearances. 

Yeah it does, it happens in a lot of jobs, civil service posts, anyone with access to classified information (which is a lot of people..).

&gt;I'm sure with every main publisher there are a network of confidentiality agreements.

Yeah so am I.

Off the top of my head, here are two ways she could survive:

1. Collapse the planetary force-field to  just protect it and her chamber.  If the field is powerful enough to protect a whole planet, it certainly could protect a few thousand cubic feet - even from the effects of a planet exploding around it.

2. She could jigger things so she piggy-backs on the teleportation beam that the Doctor used to escape, dropping out just before she arrives in the Tardis .  She could then lose herself in the crowd of Daleks and use her genius to infiltrate its leadership, becoming an essential spy and thwart the Dalek's next move to conquer the universe (or Earth)

Moffat may come up with some deus ex machina that is entirely different.

In my mind though, if you've watched the first 6 episodes and seen ""Dalek"", and you're still not interested then I doubt you'll get much of the show. Some people just can't get passed the cheesiness of it, which is a real shame because they're missing out on such a wonderful, emotional, inspirational show.

This is where I get confused. I guess I just assume once a Time Lord is grown into adulthood they regenerate into another adult, not a child. Is that a wrong assumption to make? Because it also confused me that their childhood friend/future offspring was black and it confused the plot where the Silence wanted to raise her to be the death of The Doctor, but Melody was a child at the same time as her parents.

Without that clip I'm not sure what I would prefer.

It's a core part of my personality to obsessively plan things before I start them (INTJ). So when I decided to watch Doctor Who, like everything else, I didn't take it lightly and did some research to figure out where to start. So a lot of things got kind of ""spoiled"" for me in that way. Although, for the most part I was fine with it. 

Only two things bothered me the first time through.

One was wondering when the TARDIS was going to change into the clean and wonderful contraption that is currently. I just kept thinking, ""man that new TARDIS looks so much cooler than this one"", having been unable to avoid seeing pictures of it on tumblr.

The other was absolutely dreading the transformation of the 10th doctor into the 11th. By the end of the 3rd series, I had become so attached to Tennant, and saw him as THE DOCTOR, that I just could not imagine how Matt Smith could fill those shoes. To my delight though, after seeing a few episodes of Matt Smith's Doctor, I realized that his version of the Doctor was really awesome too, and then later realized that accepting big changes in the show is really ESSENTIAL to being a Doctor Who fan. It's not a show like Friends where everything can just go on forever, just as it always has.

true,derrick81787,null,null,"Thanks.  Around here, he probably would have been taken into questioning, but we're talking a matter of hours, not days.  He would have also been allowed to have a lawyer present, and I don't think that he would have been held in a jail cell since he would have been taken in for questioning, not arrested.  Honestly, I'm not sure how they handle the scene of the shooting.  I know that they take evidence, but I'm not sure what they do about him.  I'm guessing that they would probably allow him to grab a few things and then make him stay with a relative or at a hotel or somewhere while telling him not to leave town until the investigators are finished collecting evidence, but I'm not 100% sure about that.

Arrest in the US isn't meant as a punishment either, but being locked in a jail cell for days probably feels like a punishment.  It's definitely a huge disruption to his life.  A person would only be arrested in a situation like this if there was some evidence that he did something wrong.  If the guy was shot in the back or the farmer's story didn't add up or if the police found out that the farmer had previously been in a disagreement with the guy that he shot or something, *then* he might be arrested.  He might also be arrested if there was evidence to suggest that he might flee.  Basically, you have to have evidence of wrongdoing before you arrest somebody.  Taking someone who very well might be innocent and then putting them in jail is not taken likely.

That's the problem that Americans have with this story, I think.  We don't like the idea of being arrested just for defending ourselves.  Someone else in this thread said that the farmer had to be arrested because the burglar is innocent until proven guilty.  However, most Americans would consider the farmer to be innocent until proven guilty, and I guess I just haven't heard too many Brits talk about it this way.

Anyway, thanks for the explanation.  I don't think anybody doubts that the arrest was legal according to UK law.  I think it just comes down to Americans not wanting to arrest somebody unless there is evidence that they did something wrong while Brits seem to be okay with arresting somebody if it just seems like they might have done something wrong.",0,1347046189,null,0,false,0,c64xr52,t3_z9rup,t1_c64xr52,t1_c64x576,null,1429842876,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I could be biased because I'm a guy. I certainly can't rule that out, but I just feel like to switch to a woman at this point would just be strange or pointless. I mean you're telling me that out of all the supposed ways The Doctor can look, we get 11 white human male doctors in a row, and then suddenly it's a human female? To me it would just seem like some kind of affirmative action type choice. Like they'd be choosing a female just to choose a female. That's not really an argument against doing it, since they'd have to eventually do that for it ever not to seem that way, it just seems to me like it's a little late in the game to be doing something like that. It's not like making a traditionally male super hero female or something. A super hero's title can be passed down, or they can create an alternative backstory for the female version that lets it make sense in the context of the universe the superhero inhabits. With the Doctor, he's still exactly the same person. Just with a different appearance / personality. He's still got to have had all those relationships in the past. Idk I just don't really find the idea so interesting as to warrant the change, but maybe that's just me.
 
I would have rather they just said from the beginning that he will always look like a normal man, because realistically he's probably never going to be anything else, aside from possibly a women. It's not that I necessarily don't want a female doctor, it's just that I don't think it really makes much sense. It always made less sense to me that they even bothered to say that he could look all these abnormal ways, like having two heads or something. To me saying he can look all these completely different ways and then having him ""coincidentally"" always look like a white guy, makes less sense than just saying that's the only way he can look.

Also, I was completely ignoring the issue of whether or not the fans could accept a female Doctor. Although, even I don't really know how I'd respond until I actually saw how it was done. Regardless, I definitely think ""for the sake of change"" or because of some kind of appeal to ""fairness"" are bad reasons to do it.

Or possibly if you do it in a ranty kind of way without any real basis.  I think we crossed paths at some point.

&gt;If you stay around long enough after saying the wrong thing you have people following you and down voting everything said. It's quite pernicious.

So now random people on reddit are conspiring to downvote you?

&gt;I'm not saying that there is this conspiracy and everyone in the business is in on it, however you don't get a foot in the door without being of a particular political persuasion.

A foot in the door in what? And which political persuasion? Does this apply to all the press? I mean, obviously Militant will want you to be of a certain political persuasion but the Guardian is probably quite happy with a range.  More to the point, this will be more about very public political affiliations. No surprise there that fairly conservative (in the risk averse sense) businesses won't hire people seen as exceptionally radical,  but that would apply at your local greengrocer as much as it does at a newspaper.  There are of course also rather a large number of columnists, broadcasters, writers and editors with quite controversial political affiliations in their background..  In short, it will vary.

&gt; Even though the BBC and the Guardian are branded as liberal they are still centre right when it comes to economics and military. The latter has a greater freedom to talk on left leaning social policy.

Both are pretty mixed (and frankly right and left aren't helpful terms), the point of course is that they will quite happily report on stories that show their own base and assumed constituents in a bad light where appropriate, their news reporting is pretty good and their comment stuff tends to be further to the left (which is probably more an indicator of the leanings of broadcasters, writers and comedians).  

&gt;I face palmed.

Why? If I give a paper a story and say, can you wait until 5pm to put it out, then I've embargoed it.  They can ignore me if they want, but the I won't go to them next time.  It's an opportunity for a heads up and access and who gets it will depend on the person with the access...  

&gt;It does, it means you don't know who wrote what. 

I don't know who you are, I do know that if I'm reading it in the guardian, it came from the guardian.  I am aware that they have writing staffs, that some stuff will come from wire reports (and will say so) some will be fairly anonymous additions to wire reports..  But then I don't know who filed a local news piece, who wrote the take on a given story, it isn't that important, unless of course there is a colonel in the ministry of defence dictating the content of all our media and having them pass it off.  But then that isn't happening is it.

&gt;Back to the BBC and vetting: it means that Paxman was politically approved, and Marr, Susanna Reid, Sian Williams, Huw Edwards, Gavin Esler, and I could go on.

No, it means they were vetted at some point.  I was vetted at some point, many of the people I know (people who incidentally are involved in everything from OWS through to local campaigning and the fringe..) have been vetted at one time or another.  Anyone who has ever had access to classified information was vetted, all our police officers are vetted...  

&gt;We'll have to have this conversation again after the Iran war. 

Yeah, lets do that.

&gt; Ultimately journalism in the UK is shit and homogenous. Why? It doesn't matter if the cause is systemic, deliberate or accidental, but intuition says there is a corrupting force somewhere and that is what I am calling the ""control"".

Right, so now you are redefining control to mean somewhat shit and that most news outlets report on news.

true,titang,donna,Donna,"Idea, with holes in it I’m sure. If they wanted to trap and destroy the Doctor they'd have to be pretty damn tricky obviously. Perhaps they came across the Doctor in another and former (for them) time when he had Clara Oswin as a companion. A plan is hatched (no pun intended).

-	Draw him in by asking for help banking on the fact that he’ll help any species in need. As a bonus he gets to destroy some trash Daleks which cleans up house for them rather nicely and makes the idea more appealing.
-	Get him on the planet surrounded by unpredictable and insane Daleks with a Very strong urge to kill him. Add in a shield making it almost impossible to get out. 
-	Give him a reason to stay as long as possible to increase chances of succeeding in destroying him. Have his mother and father in law there and in peril. As a back up plan have another companion appear trapped, and in the midst of their most dangerous Daleks to boot (seriously like that one crazy Dalek was well chained up…). They could have met Clara Oswin in a former time (for them) and used her genius as a reason for having her own ship and unfortunately crashing there. This works whether he knows her at this point in time or not. Either way he is sympathetic and wants to help her. If he had known her already her memory loss at being converted explains her name being ‘off’ and not remembering him. Also allowing them to only need a few facts about her to make this plausible (looks, i.q, and name etc). The eggs issue could just be a comment she made when meeting them initially about how their ‘bumps’ look like eggs and how they relate to soufflés. Or something equally silly.

Though they seem to plan for many instances, they fail due to arrogance in their ability to create. To make a Dalek truly believe its human, allow it to retain its ability to feel and give it believable memories. Not understanding the true strength of feelings themselves they underestimate their power. The Oswin Dalek is not only tortured by its own feelings and wants an out, it also sympathizes with the doctor and decides to help him.
Of course now their memory is wiped. But later in the Doctors time line he meets Clara Oswin and runs across the Daleks who then hatched the plan and we come full circle.  Shes still technically alive as she was never actually turned into a Dalek.

I can also see how it wouldn't or couldn't happen as well.
Being that we have seen a Time Lady before, we know that  they obviously have separate sexes and it seems highly unlikely that they would just change sexes during a regeneration.

Also, all the myths and legends surrounding him state ""He"" and so on, never a mention of a ""she"" or ""they"" pronoun.

I could care less about tradition and keeping it like the old days if the story makes sense and good television then I am all for changes.

I dont think the writing could get away without making her a stereotypical woman in spots and that would ruin it for me.

I have seen a very few female characters who just happen to be women written well and don't at some point fall into those ""well, she has a motherly instinct"" crap or suddenly, ""she has the ability to create life so she is perfect for this situation"" right now Jenny Sparks from the Authority written by Warren Ellis is a good example of a character doing what they do the best way they do it who just happens to be a woman but not written girly at the drop of a hat.

true,ajehals,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;...is a form of control.

It is a form of controlling the information that an organisation puts out.  It isn't control of the media.  The media doesn't need to respect it, sometimes it doesn't.  It isn't equivalent to an investigative journalist finding something out and being told not to report it.  The point is that a free press is not free of any external factors, there will always be internal debate about priorities, when to put what story out, what to focus on, what to drop.  When the press is dealing with 'upstream' (your term and inaccurate, it suggests the press is entirely fed externally..) sources it isn't one controlling the other, it's a temporary agreement to act in a certain way.

&gt;On the one hand you are saying that journalism is dependent upon upstream sources

No, I didn't say it was dependent on anything, I said it makes use of press releases and such excessively, but it isn't dependent on them. The press in this country still do rather a lot of good, investigative journalism.  They are free to do so and they do it.  In addition to that, their (largely online, but also some print) reporting is constant, they are constantly looking for material to put out that their readership and the public might be interested in.  Take the whole big brother stuff from a while back, the press was full of it, personally I wasn't that interested, but a lot of people were, there was all sorts of stuff being reported, some from official sources, some from research, comment pieces, investigative work, some of the tabloids were quite exploitative, but they thought people were interested. That's how the press works, regardless of who their advertisers are, who is in government or anything else, they have a world of interesting stories, but have to condense it into something that people are interested in, at the same time they now no longer have a limit on column inches for their online stuff and so they will talk about Pfizers latest drug release (likely based on a press release) and Galloways latest random video.

&gt;Loz recently had to tout a piece on the Pirate Bay ban to the Guardian, presumably for free. That's what I call journalistic subsidy, and just sends ad revenue to the same publishers that enforce the homogeneity and the national mind set. 

So how do you get a story out to people who wouldn't look for it?  How do you take an issue that most people aren't aware of and get people to look at it?  I can put a blog post out on the ppuk site tomorrow and have 5k people a day read it, that's great, but they are all people who are already convinced, or on their way to it (or they already absolutely oppose it). Broadly they are already aware. If we get a piece out in the Guardian, or the Independent, we suddenly have a huge number of people who didn't know about an issue being made aware of it.  Hell, to an extent the guardian isn't even that fantastic for ppuk issues, after all, a large portion of their readership likely understand or are aware of the issues that we talk about and try to deal with.  But the point is that we put something together that we think is right (whether an article or a release) and we try and get it in front of as many people as possible.  That's what we have to do to make people aware of the issues the press would otherwise miss and people who aren't looking for information wouldn't see.

As to the Ad revenue, do you think that advertisers support Loz's positions on what we talk about? Given that we tend to be at the opposite end of the spectrum from the publishers association, how come we are getting any press at all? Surely the various large lobby groups (who all advertise with and have huge constituencies within the media world) should have shut us down by now.. That hasn't happened, in fact on a week by week basis our ability to talk to people via the press is increasing.  That's largely because our ideas are right, partly because we are expressing them in a way that is interesting and broadly because the media is happy to take that to their readers.

&gt;Journalism becomes controlled by that which can provide the best subsidies.

So what is your solution? You have defined the problem as you see it, how do you solve it? I would love a media where no group can put any meaningful pressure on the press, where advertisers aren't needed, where people can get the information that is available in an unbiased and balanced way, but apart from some small tweaks, most of the changes that might enforce those things would be worse than the the problems they seek to solve.

There are real issues, some of which come about because the press is not heavily regulated and fairly free, but the way sockshoe is presenting them is absurd, he isn't talking about the issues, so much as trying to stitch them together to present a case that is wildly beyond what there is any evidence to support. The notion behind churnalism and all the other people that are talking about press release journalism is entirely true if you look at the aggregate output of media organisations, (Nick Davies is excellent by the way), but that isn't to say that there isn't quite a lot of good, proper journalism happening too.

You got caught laughing at a girl and she was humiliated. She is a person, a human being with feelings, and she it's probably not the first time that she has felt humiliated by other employees at work. 

She is aggressive, uncouth, and lacks social skills, but you work at McDonald's as a burger flipper, not as a professional where your coworkers are going to be highly educated. 

So, you got caught laughing at a girl, she felt humiliated. Maybe she thought you were cute, and laughing at her broke her heart. Or maybe she knows everyone hates her there, but thought you were one of the good ones. Maybe she was swearing on the phone because her personal life is messed up, and getting laughed at was the straw that broke the camel's back. Who knows. But you did laugh at her, which seriously sucks, and now she is pissed off. 

What you could do to completely de-escalate the situation with no negative consequences for anyone, is very simple. Apologize. 

You could invite her out for a cup of coffee, your treat, and talk to her like a human being, and turn an enemy into a friend. You could, get the other guys at work to stop making fun of her, and leave for uni knowing that you have made the world a slightly better place by making a job less shitty for someone. 

Or you could do what everyone else is suggesting and get her fired, and really wreck her life, and then go to uni and forget all about her.

Anyhow, you lease this pub with a romantic idea in your head of running the local boozer. There's just a couple of minor issues the pub company didn't mention:

   - A large number of their pubs haven't made a profit in ten years or more - the neighbourhood pub is basically a dying species, killed off by cheap booze in the supermarket and fancy pubs in town that do food. But that doesn't bother them because if you jack it in early, they'll just sell the same lease to somebody else.
   - The products they're selling you - that you're obliged to buy from them and nobody else - are sold to you at around the same price, if not rather more, than the price of an equivalent can of beer from your local supermarket and considerably more than the price from any reputable wholesaler. But you have to pay your staff, your rent, your electricity - which means that if you don't markup the price on SOMETHING considerably, you're buggered.
   - You can't say ""Fuck you, I'll buy from someone else and you can swivel for the beer"". They've fitted meters to the beer taps, if you sell more than you're buying, you risk the lease.

What's the landlord to do? Without a sky-high markup on at least something he sells, he cannot operate his business.

Usually what happens is the landlord develops a drinking problem and/or jacks it in within 12-18 months, pissing away his retirement money like so much lager and then the pub is let to someone else for the cycle to repeat.",0,1347058188,null,0,false,0,c650wi0,t3_zicgq,t1_c650wi0,t3_zicgq,null,1429844364,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

It would have to be done right because it would change the whole dynamic of the show.  Such as: Would male companions want to protect her too much?  I can't see the Doctor putting up with that for long. Having a female companion would be too much lesbianism for the mainstream, even though Beeb tries to keep too much sexuality out of Doctor Who because it is supposed to be a show for KIDS.

true,ajehals,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;It's about what gets repeated, like I said. The whole noble jack the lad Harry fighting for his queen and country was gushed over every hour or so on the main news. The same with the ""big society"", ""britain unchained"", reverence for the armed forces, the jubilee and olympic coverage (which has been ridiculous).

It's about interest though.  Lots of people were genuinely interested in all of the things that you referenced, bar the big society bit, which got panned in most of the press.

&gt;The solution to journalism is to fracture the business model, 

That's been happening slowly for the last 30 years, accelerating for the last 10.  But it hasn't exactly brought about a new and better, or rather more honest press.

&gt; by your own admission the media just wants to fill air time and inches. (I would contest this is only half the story and nearly all publications are brands of politics, but I don't have to for the purposes of the argument.).

I said that online, they have pressure to put stuff out, not that they 'just want to fill air time and inches'.

Well yes, that's true in a wider sense anyway, but what intellectual property rights have a significant impact on the quality of news reporting specifically?

true,random2502,null,null,"Away to start my 4th year in Dundee so will hopefully be able to help you with a few things. Ask about anything else you need. I don't know if you're staying in halls or private accommodation so I'll say what I can about both, as I've done both myself.

**Rent**

If you're staying in private accommodation try looking for private landlords, most students will stick with the big letting agencies which might mean you can get a good deal with a private landlord, and don't be afraid to haggle, we got our rent down by £16 a month, which is almost £200 a year. They also tend to much quicker at fixing things (or at least mine is) because you can go straight to them, there's no middle man.

**Electricity**

Shop around, but if yourer is all set up with one company check with the landlord before changing it. Also you can get discounts for various things:
* Don't use a prepaid meter, it may seem simple to begin with but it costs more in the long run.
* Sign up to pay by direct debit with a set amount a month, we get a discount of 6% by paying this way rather than getting a bill and paying afterwards.
* We also get a smaller discount, I think 1-2%, by going paperless and getting our bills by email.
* Check that your night and day readings (if you have them) are the right way round, ours weren't and it was costing us a lot more than it should.

**Internet &amp; Phone**

It's worth shopping around for a deal, finding out the cheapest for what it is you want (just phone, phone+internet, phone+internet+TV or whatever else there is these days), and once you have the cheapest calling up the others once again to ask if they can beat the offer. Most won't, but it's worth a shot. If you have a limit on your downloads make copious use of university WiFi, just be careful what you download doesn't break any uni rules, I got kicked off for a week for doing things I should have done.

**TV**

You only need a TV license if you're planning on watching live TV as its broadcast (be that online or on a TV). You don't need one for iPlayer, 4oD etc, so don't get one if you don't need one. You can also reclaim back months you don't need at the end of the year so if everyone in your flat goes home for 3 months over summer then remember and claim those months back. However, bare in mind that in halls each person needs their own license as you have separate contracts.

**Insurance**

Insure anything you will need and don't want broken. My laptop dies about a year ago and without my insurance I would have been screwed. Shop around for the best deal, Endsleigh were the cheapest for me and they focus on students. Check with your parents though for anything that might be covered by their insurance as they're no point in insuring stuff twice. You could also skip insurance altogether and just say that stuff broke at your parents, but that's ever so slightly illegal so you better hope you don't get caught.

**Halls**

In my halls in Dundee *almost* everything was included. Electricity, heating, insurance, internet, the whole shebang, so don't bother paying for anything that you get provided in halls. A lot of people I know got insurance only to find out that they were double insured which actually makes both policies null and void.

**Food**

Look or a local Aldi or Lidl and see what sort of deals you can get there, but don't just rely on them. In first year I just presumed Lidl would be cheaper than Tesco but for a lot of things Tesco was actually cheaper if I bought Tesco Value. Since then Tesco Value has changed to Everyday Value which in my opinion is slightly better quality and is worth checking out. I'm yet to find something so bad that I wouldn't buy it, so huge chunks of my diet consists of Value foods, and I save a load because of it.

I know the adverts say that making your own meals is cheaper than ready meals, but quite often that's not true unless you make the meals in bulk. If you have limited freezer space and/or flatmates who don't want to eat together then cheap ready meals can actually save you money over making your own, although obviously it's a lot less healthy!

Stock cubes and frozen veg are both incredibly useful, you can pretty much throw them in anything you make to add to the flavour and bulk out the portions.

When eating out look for deals and offers. You'll probably find local takeaways will do pretty good value for money set meals, and chains like Domino's, Pizza Hut, McDonalds etc will bombard you with discount vouchers. Use them. I have never paid more than half price for a takeaway pizza since I came to university. For restaurants sign up for Groupon, ItIsOn and voucher sites like that, if you have a special occasion coming up have a look and see if there's any restaurant deals currently available. I check my Groupon emails every day and have bought all sorts of things from them, some with massive discounts.

**Drinks**

If you're going out, predrink in your flat first, you will save a lot of money that way. When going out your students' union will probably be by far the cheapest for entry and drinks, so go there if at all possible (unless it's crap I suppose, Dundee has the #1 union in Scotland and #3 in the UK, so I suppose I got lucky there). For other clubs and pubs look for VIP and discount cards, these are often free or cheap to students and are worth getting if you go out a lot, if they're free then get them even if you never plan on going to the place, you never know what could happen. You'll often find PR reps from clubs and pubs hanging about during Freshers' Week, so take as many freebies as you can carry.

**Books**

If possible buy second hand, it will save you masses of money. Amazon and ebay are usually good. You might find a second hand shop on or near campus but it probably won't be as good as online. When your modules are finished sell the books back as a way of getting at least some of your money back (if you sell well you can actually make a profit doing this). Before buying anything check if you can get it for free online as an ebook, normally through your uni's library but it might just be free somewhere if you have a Google.

**Clothes**

Second hand and charity shops are pretty good for clothes, you can usually get all right stuff for next to nothing. Even if it is a bit worn, for the price you'll be paying then I wouldn't complain.

**Furniture**

Look out for local police auctions and second hand stores for cheap furniture, lighting etc, you can save a lot of money doing this. There's a massive recycling centre in Dundee which is a god-send for stuff like that, have a look around Salford for something similar. I have liked the local police force on Facebook and they update me with the dates of local police auctions, these usually have a catalogue online so have a look through for anything you like and if you see anything then just go along and have a bid.

**Pets**

They might seem like a good idea, but they cost money. Don't do it. I made that mistake and regretted it pretty quick.

**Movies**

Cineworld do a good deal on the cinema if you have one nearby and plan on going lots. £15 a month for unlimited movies, so if you go see three a month it's already saved you money. You still have to pay the extras for 3D though. Netflix and LoveFilm are also worth looking into, but only if you plan on using them. Also check your university library for movies, ours has loads (presumably for English and Film Studies students) but there's some good ones in there and you can usually check them out for free.

**Everything else**

Like I said before, sign up for online websites like Groupon and check the emails, most of it will be rubbish but you could get a few good things in there. Also check websites like Gumtree and Craig's List for things, you can get pretty much anything on them if you look hard enough. And during your Freshers' Week try and nab every freebie you can, it might not be useful when you get it but it could come in handy at some point. My union has a Freshers' Fayre which is full of stalls and freebies of all varieties, I go every year and get everything I can.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"This. Porto and Benfica are used as an embarkment point for players from Brazil and other parts of South America because of visa issues first, and then second because of the cultural connection. It is near impossible to find players in South America in any age bracket that haven't already been tapped up by third party ownership, it is part of the business model for football clubs in the area.

Add to that that taking players directly from South America to the Premier League is difficult unless either:

a) they have already represented the national side in the first team for at least a half-dozen games

b) they are under 16 and can move to Liverpool and become home grown

anything between those two variables and you are into the second tier of players who are both third party owned and can't get work permits. Recruiting younger players is riskier, recruiting the established players is more expensive.

Porto didn't make 300M on transfers like the post to /r/soccer suggested. They would be lucky to get around 40-50M of that. The agents pay a decent part of the player salary, they pay the relocation costs and they are essentially leasing the playing time to Porto and Benfica etc. in return for getting their players into the Champions League to be showcased.

We already have extensive scouting networks in South America. We spotted Moura early and made a bid for him (£14M IIRC) and the same with Ganso. The main problem is the huge valuation bubble that is currently happening because of Neymar.

""Send more scouts to South America like Porto do"" may sound like a genius solution but basically everybody else has thought of that already and there are problems and nuances with it that aren't immediately clear.

My own opinion is that there are better scouting returns to be had on the Euro mainland mainly with immigrant players who are already in the EU. Look at countries like Belgium, Germany, France etc. where the national sides and national leagues are built on many immigrant players. And an entire second tier of players in Spain who don't get much notice.

The players are just as good as South Americans, are from all over the world, have easier visa and work permit issues and are a lot cheaper than South America. ",0,1347065235,null,0,false,0,c652gj1,t3_zi06u,t1_c652gj1,t1_c64t9o4,null,1429845127,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

* NEVER go shopping while hungry. You will buy all kinds of shit that you don't need without even realising.

* Try your best not to be tempted by offers in supermarkets. Think to yourself, is this an item you would buy anyway if it wasn't on offer? If it is then think of the offer as a bonus. If not then move on.

* If you're on Pay As You Go or your mobile contract is up for renewal get yourself a Giff Gaff SIM card. They have great value. Alternatively, get a SIM-only contract with whoever gets you the best value. In the latter case, go into a Phones4U or Carphone Warehouse shop and sit down with a salesman. Umm and Arr for long enough and you can get yourself a pretty decent deal (e.g. 300 minutes, unimilted texts and unlimited data for £15.32 a month on T-Mobile)

* Pre-drink. Buy yourself a bottle of Tesco Value vodka or if you're more of the gentlemanly type, a bottle of Tesco Value gin and Tesco Value tonic water and get just a little tipsy before hitting the town. Or just drink at home and don't go out. House/flat parties always generate the best stories anyway.

* If you do go out only take with you what you can afford to spend. Take that amount as cash and leave your card at home.

* Find your local Wetherspoons. Yes, they're not a ""proper"" pub but they're nice enough. Their real ales can be had at very good prices too if you're an open minded drinker. A good way to broaden your tastes.

* Learn to cook basic meals and avoid takeaways like the plague. Tip: Make a large amount of pasta bolognese and the leftovers can be turned into pasta bake simply by sprinkling cheese on top and putting it in the oven on high heat until the cheese starts to go crispy.

* If you must get takeaways sign up to get text alerts from Dominos. About once a month they'll do deals like BOGOF, any pizza for £7, free garlic bread, etc. These tend to be collection only though. Also, eatstudent.co.uk to order from local takeaways online.

* If you're the organised type, budget your money and work out exactly how much you can afford to spend each day. Remember to take into account bills. Leave a little extra for unexpected costs.

* If you have a car leave it at home, SORN it and cancel your insurance. Better yet, just sell it. You won't need a car in uni. Really, you won't. Buy a cheap Gumtree push bike to get around. Does wonders for your wallet and your fitness.

* If you're technically inclined, learn to fix your own computer. You won't have to pay for repairs and, if you get the word out, people will come to you to have their computer fixed. There's good money to be made here. Same for your push bike.

* If you have a laptop made by Advent, Acer, Compaq or HP sell it now while it still works and buy something made by Asus, Toshiba, Lenovo or Samsung. As a student much of your life is going to revolve around your computer. It makes sense therefore to have a computer that isn't going to fail on you unexpectedly. 

* If you HAVE to have a Mac get a 13"" Macbook Pro. Like the above its worth paying extra for a quality product. The standard Macbooks aren't built to the same standard as the pros and don't last.

* Buy yourself a colour laser printer. Inkjets (especially HPs) cost a silly amount of money to run. A friend recently spent £54 on a set of cartridges for his HP printer. Yes, colour lasers take up a lot of space but they pay for themselves. A complete set of toners for my Dell 1320c costs £25 and is good for 1000 pages. Compare that with £54 for a set of HP inks that is only good for about 150 pages.

true,BatmansBFF,jack,Jack Harkness,"Well, I'm not exactly certain, I just think it's an interesting theory.

For starters, Rory's character is seen evolving into a more intense, angry person.  Of course he has been through a lot, but sometimes you see this complete intensity and lack of emotion in his eyes.  Let's also point out the fact that Rory was not even the least bit surprised the first time he walked into the Tardis.  As you've probably noticed, every other person comments on how large it is on the inside or just stands in awe.  He shares that same reaction with the Master.  In the episode ""Let's Kill Hitler"" after seeing River regenerate and being exposed to the completely raw energy of time for the first time, he complains of a banging in his head; Amy explains it away as Hitler in the closet.  However, you can't hear him at all in there and none of the other characters claim to hear him in the closet.  Rory is the only one who hears the pounding.  Let's not forget ""The God Complex"", Rory didn't have a room. He was the singular person they made an avid point in saying he didn't have one. Some people also mention the Doctor looking into his room saying, ""Of course it was you.""  After, you can hear the TARDIS distress call in 4 repetitions. The only other time it has been heard before was when The Master stole it after their first meeting in the 3rd series.  Also let me quote this odd conversation that takes place between Rory and the Doctor:
""The Doctor: Have you found your room yet?
Rory: No. Is that good or bad?
The Doctor: Maybe you’re not scared of anything.
Rory: Well after all the time I’ve spent with you in the TARDIS, what was left to be scared of.
The Doctor: You said that in the past tense.
Rory: No I didn’t.""
Another good point to make is the fact alone that River is a time lord.  The Doctor DOES say that it could be for the fact that she was conceived on the TARDIS, however we all know the number one rule which is that the Doctor lies.

Anyway, that's about all I've got.  It's just an interesting concept to me, I think.  I've also heard some people who speculate that Omega will be coming back also.  Who knows what will happen for sure!  I just hope it's interesting.",0,1347067250,null,0,false,0,c652vzc,t3_zgxxj,t1_c652vzc,t1_c64yd1f,null,1429845296,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

If enough people are there and better organised, I'd put money on Multiplay taking notice and giving us a stage sponsored tournament. They took a bit of notice this year, the feedback was flooded with users suggesting it, but IMO they won't act on it until the next summer lan (i49).

But times have changed. Lets move with them.

 I can think of SO MANY AMAZING WOMEN who could be truly FANTASTIC as the Doctor. Helen Mirren anyone? Helena Bonham Carter? Lara Pulver? (Irene Adler) I'd love to see what they have to add to the story. Men have a certain carisma and attitude in playing the Doctor, but what would it mean to change gender? I think it would be an amazing way of keeping the story fresh. Its only a gimmick if you make it one. 

 And to those who think we can't have a female Doctor because of River Song? She was raised in the time of Captain Jack. You love Jack? You comfortable with Jack? Go think about what the actual difference would be. Thats right. Nothing. A gay woman is no less shameful than a gay man.

I think we need to reexamine who the Doctor really is. Is he a man or is the Doctor something more than that?

As long as you avoid a few big no-nos which are stereotypes of Americans visiting here you should be fine. The big ones are

* Loudness of voice, we tend to talk quite a bit quieter than you guys are. This is partially volume and partly because American accents can sound quite nasal to our ears. 
* Complaining about the UK, be it politics, or food. This can be confusing for visitors because Britain loves to complain and moan endlessly - but this is something we do about ourselves and even if you join in meaning the best, it's liable to be taken the wrong way. Once you know someone well it becomes a different matter of course, and with people you know a mutual grumble is a great British bonding experience.
* People will be interested in where you come from. If asked it's genuine interest. There's nothing wrong with talking about America as long as you don't imply or outright state it's better than the UK (which will raise hackles).

In terms of staying American I don't think you'll have much trouble. Considering where you're from, you might consider introducing friends to Southern cooking, which (having been all over the US) I probably rate the best American cuisine. Our food is actually a lot better than international stereotypes have it and we're quite keen these days on experiencing different foods, but Southern cooking hasn't really infilitrated our cuisine. With the exception of fried chicken, which is generally pretty poor stuff and the kind of thing you have to soak up alcohol on a night out.

This is more relationship advice than British advice, but why don't you just ask him? I'm sure he has a reason, and I'm sure he'll tell you it.

If nobody writes about female protagonists, nobody is going to figure out how to do it right. And maybe if we had more female writers (and the number has increased a lot in this past century or whatever decades) we'd have better examples.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Well the show came up in 1963 and was thought up by a Canadian named Sydney Newman. Verity Lambert (producer) is also credited for co-creating Doctor Who. A Canadian and a woman making tv? How scandalous! Oh the sixties. The BBC always treated Doctor Who as an embarrassment right up to the day it ended in 1989. They gave the original DW team in '63 a real hard time.

It was initially meant to be educational for kids. They would start off the story around a mysterious stranger who only called himself the Doctor. Part of the mystery was who was he? So they called the show Doctor Who and vowed to never go deeply into that joke onscreen.

Welp Moffat just did it. It's a clever question but I don't see how it can end in anything but disappointment. Half the fun is in the mystery. But we'll see...

Original Background Notes for Doctor Who (text version): http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/doctorwho/6403.shtml?page=txt

edit: Also just because I want to add more, DW was meant to be educational, but as you know it failed. They had a low budget and only a few episodes per-year. Like 13 was it? And they were screwed after the first four. They had no script. Nothing ready to start shooting with except this old trash some guy named Terry Nation wrote. And Newman really didn't want any BEMs (Bug-Eyed Monsters) in the show or nonsense but Nation's script went through and *The Daleks* was aired. Ironically it becomes a hit overnight and the DW team suddenly gets 40 episodes.

Many of Doctor Who's greatest successes were total accidents- like the show itself. And Tom Baker's scarf.",0,1347081272,null,0,1347081663,0,c655qmw,t3_zjlhm,t1_c655qmw,t3_zjlhm,null,1429846778,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Although Eccleston's finale might be in there, too, it's so hard to choose.

Midnight is so intense, and so different.  I love that it's almost all dialogue, and that it really shows The Doctor trying to learn to cope with himself still.  He's so arrogant and sure of himself that he ends up getting played against himself.

The Doctor's Wife is just a fun one.  Just the right amount of seriousness and silliness that makes Matt Smith.

And The Impossible Planet and The Satan Pit are just edge-of-your-seat suspense combined with nightmare-inducing scares that work so well with Tennant's Doctor.
