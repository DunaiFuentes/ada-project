Are there any developments that come out of cancer research which aren't 'taken' by pharma? Presumably the scientists who are 'sponsored' by donations go to work with big pharma and their research and expertise is not 'really' shared with the public unless at great cost?

I suppose i'm trying to figure out if i've got this right in my head:

1: I donate some money to CR

2: the money goes to support someone like your friend to get her PHD

3: your friend gets the PHD and goes to work for Pfizer who use her research to build drug 'X'

4: drug 'X' is released for £££££££ by the pharma?

If big pharma could 'sponsor' more of the education rather than charities it might save some money maybe.

true,Mondoshawan,null,null,"&gt; That's not a very healthy way to run a country.

Actually, it is, it's an ""investment"". Paying for schooling and healthcare provides a good pool of workers that aren't tied to the job like they are in the USA. This gives them the ability to self-improve, for example a building laborer is free to start his own business knowing that cancer or some other serious ailment won't sink his entire family. In countries without free healthcare that option simply is not available for Joe the Plumber. People literally are wage slaves, unable to take even a short break because of the risks to their healthcare coverage. This is very evident in the jobs market, where employees can get away with offering only two weeks vacation. If you don't like it, you don't get healthcare. It creates a culture where only the already-wealthy can be entrepreneurial. People like Mitt Romney. 

&gt; On an average salary of £23k/yr, an average person is barely going to pay enough to tax to cover that

And they wouldn't need to if everyone paid their share. Unfortunately large corporations and the insanely rich are doing all within their power to have a ""dependance"" on not paying taxes. There are the ones giving us ""Entitlement Britain"". 

&gt; Do we really want WORKING people to still be dependent on government to pay basic things like their rent?

If there was enough housing they wouldn't need to. Artificial scarcity is what drives the prices up, benefiting the rich landowners and developers. This situation did not come about by accident.

The meeting, at the British embassy in Washington, is disclosed in a forthcoming book by the Guardian journalist Ian Cobain. It raises serious questions about repeated claims by senior MI5 and MI6 officers that they were slow to appreciate the US response to the attacks, and never connived in torture.

The meeting signalled to British officials that the US was preparing to embark on a global kidnapping programme which became known as extraordinary rendition. Cobain reveals that at the end of a three-hour presentation by Cofer Black, President George Bush's top counter-terrorist adviser, Mark Allen – his opposite number in MI6 – commented that it all sounded ""rather bloodcurdling"".

A few weeks later, in early October 2001, at a secret meeting at Nato headquarters in Brussels, US officials drew up a list of ""necessary measures to increase security"", Cobain discloses. They included flights to and from secret prisons in Asia, Africa, and throughout Europe.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I don't think anyone has ever questioned the fact that AVB did a horrible job of man management at Chelsea.  But based on the quotes that are being seen about AVB (despite the media loving to report anything negative about him) he has made a true effort to improve that aspect.  Bale, Lennon, Walker, Jan, Caulker, Defoe have all spoken very positively of his influence.  Even the player who appear to be on the outs (Lloris, Dawson, Ade, Thudd) haven't been overly critica of him.

The impression that i had gotten wasn't that AVB couldn't control Fat Frank and everything fell apart it was that he couldn't control Terry, Cole, Essien. I had always seen that Lampard was an issue, but really more of an annoyance while Terry, Cole, Essien had been complete twats.  the situation with Drogba (the perceived pressure to play Torres over him) also didn't help.

This is not to take anything away from RDM, he has done a great job (as much as i hate saying it) and deserves a great deal of credit.  But look what has been afforded to him (deserving so) to reshape the team....He has Hazard, Oscar, Marin, Azpilicueta, Moses come in, and he sends out Essien, doesn't resign Drogba, benches Lampard, and is dealing with Cole. Now compare that to AVB when he was brought in to ""reshape"" Chelsea....He brought in Mata, Meireles, Cahill, Kevin De Bruyne, Lucas Piazon, Lukaku and Oriol Romeu....Mata is a vital signing, Cahil is Terry's replacement, Meireles was a squad player and the rest were investments for the future.  He wasn't given the ability to drop players like Drogba, Essien and didn't have the depth to drop Lampard.  RDM was given a license to reshape the team (and very much earned) because of his winning the CL. AVB was asked to ""reshape the team"" but not given as much ability to do so, he then ran afoul of the clubhouse leaders who knew he was there to see them off to the sunset and he managed them horribly

He seems to have learned a bit from this (i think he is still learning) and seems to be dealing with the team here a bit better.

Lets not forget, the season is 8 games old....that means we have a minimum of **30** league games plus cups to determine how he is actually shaping the team.  how bout we all give him a little longer to work on the team before we start demanding AVB's head lest we become the poor version of Chelsea and firing coaches every year.

I would sell downing, seriously, for like 10 mil. or less, to cover the cost of someone like Joselu. I think we have a bunch of midfielders, and are not really short of wide attackers, so he's surplus and has a bit of reputation for consistency before his liverpool days so 10 mil. is realistic I think.

Also, Sahin to be bought. I don't expect Real to let him go for less than 15/20 million but it can be done if we sell some more - like Cole for 3-5 million to... perhaps QPR? (we could get some extra cash from them if they're in the relegation zone again). 

Also, Tello would be a GREAT purchase, but I think under Vilanova Barca really wants to keep him, and if that's the case, 20 mil. may be the cost and that's too much for us to spend.

true,lol_oopsie,null,null,"No problem. I'll try to explain a bit more.

Yes, plenty of developments come from outside of big pharma. Drug discovery is only one part of ""cancer research"", which is obviously an enormous topic. Basically, big pharmaceutical companies are the only ones who can afford to put the time, effort and money into creating and testing drugs. Firstly, they will screen drugs in big batch computer modeling tests and pick good candidates. Then they test on cells or model systems, then animals, then humans. However, this process takes around 10 years and costs something like ~£500m per drug. And of course, most drugs fail at some point. That's why profits from one drug can seem so obscene - they've had to cover the loss of the other ones which didn't work. I'm not saying big pharma are saints and don't make huge profits, but they also incur massive expenses and take big risks too.

If you donate money to CRUK, they do things like buying lab equipment for universities and sponsoring PhD students or post-doctoral researchers. Typically that involves paying a yearly stipend to live off, as well as covering research costs (i.e. materials and tuition fees). Things that the scientists discover get published in journals, which then give recognition to the student/supervisor/university, and they can then use that to apply for more money.

Once published, that data is then in the public domain, and others will read it, have opinions, decide to try an alternate route, then publish that data etc etc. Big companies do look at that data too, and it gives them information about drug targets, mechanisms etc. It isn't really the companies ""taking"" the data - it's actually a GOOD thing that it is shared, and even better that it is used by somebody. The person who made the discovery doesn't necessarily go and get the job in the company afterwards, but that's fine - nobody would be bitter about having their work used.

Also, companies DO sponsor students and research quite a bit. Funding typically comes from charities, government funding agencies and from private investment. Usually each source has their own stipulation about the topic, methods etc. So for instance, a company who makes lab equipment might specify that you need to use their gear to do your work. Or government agencies specify that you have to research a particular area. Charities do too, for obvious reasons.

Also, there aren't really any massive breakthroughs any more. Scientists are discovering more and more pieces of the puzzle, so the more data contributed, the better the chance of the whole picture being revealed. But it's not like there will ever be ""cure for cancer"" - there will likely be lots of different ways of reducing lots of different cancers, and eventually it will be to a point where it won't be your cause of death any more (a bit like HIV/AIDS is now.. the treatment is so advanced that you die of old age, even though you still have HIV).

I've considered several things but I'll probably at least try and get AS FM. I think part of the issue is I did go to a comprehensive for years 7-11 whereas most of the people in my school have always been at grammars, and therefore most have done at least part of AS maths already, and so the teachers assume we know stuff when although I understand the concepts, I may need a little longer to learn how to apply them. Additionally, we don't actually have the full amount of time we're supposed to have for Maths/FM. As it's taken as a single option at my school - we have 14 periods of a 2 week timetable, instead of 10 per 1 subject. So we miss 6 periods, per fortnight.

true,paradin,null,null,"You'll get no argument from me that River hit an all time low in TATM, but I don't think her role in the story has changed substantially.

The show is shot from the perspective of the Doctor interacting with the universe. Time lords live in completely first person narrative. Changes to the particular set of all past moments, all present moments, and all possible futures that time lords see at all times (as mentioned in Bad Wolf pt II) can only be made by another time traveler, a time travel aware being, or a chess piece set in motion by either of those things. Whenever two time travelers simultaneously interact with a particular moment, they enter each other's ""bubbles"".

When River travels with the Doctor, she is in his bubble. Since the camera is shot from the perspective of his bubble, she cannot be anything but ""completely defined by the actions of the Doctor and his companions"" while interacting with that bubble. She remains special on account of also being a Time Lord, and continues to meddle with the meta-universe while not with the Doctor. This is what has enabled each of them to pass a message to the other by way of a quick edit to the distant past.

There's a downside to the frequent interaction between these two figures, I imagine. They sure seem to have this nasty habit of throwing fixed points in time at each other like confetti every time they meet. River will always die in the library. Doctor #11 will always experience more than his poor old soul can handle at some point after travelling alone too much.

I think my current view on River's corny levels of flirty behavior has a bit to do with the events of 11's run up to this point being the top of the bell curve for her. The period of time where she and the Doctor are both aware how they are connected to each other and both frequently spend time in the presence of each other as well as Amy and Rory is the golden era of their interaction with each other. River has been experiencing things backwards, so she has always known that one day Amy and Rory are never going to be seen again, and for spoilers sake she can never know why until it happens. She's about to spend the rest of her relationship with #11 watching him unravel the way doctors usually do when a companion gets edited out of all his potential future experiences.

If that's not enough to send him into territory crazier than ""Time Lord Victorious"", we still get to watch him experience a chain of events that apparently results in his next companion being turned into a dalek and then blown up by enough missiles to destroy a planet.

His jokes about Harvey from what I gather/remember us that they are not about his disability but his mother's cynical and despicable exploitation of the child for her own personal gain and for general celebrity attention whoring and in the context of an attack on her. They are certainly in poor taste but like most of his jokes, such as the ones the mirror cited, have a mixture of a point and ironic detachment. 

In an episode of the Peacock and Gamble Podcast Ray Peacock (a genuinely brilliant stand up) start talking about this with a few serious points particularly attacking her and the inconsistencies in her complaints in a satirical comic dialogue about Jordan and Harvey that make anything Frankie Boyle has said absolutely tame but compared to him Peacock and Gamble are much more able to show a sense of irony through his on stage/air persona while interjecting it with serious points.

I think it's exactly like the Movie Tavern! Always always reserve through the website. For TV at the Alamo, the tickets themselves are free, that is not what you are paying for. You are purchasing a voucher to be used on food. (Conveniently, 5$ to ""reserve"" a seat gives you a 5$ food voucher, and their yummy nummy shakes are exactly 5$...) For a Dr. Who show, if you show up without a reservation/voucher, you definitely won't get in to watch the show. For ""general"" reservations, you'll want to be at LEAST 40 mins early. I usually show up about 5 to 10 mins prior to the start of the show because I do priority reservation (assigned seating, which does cost 2$ - so the total for seating is 7$: 5$ voucher, 2$ reservation) and no one will take my spot even if I showed up late. On the site OP linked, the system does not appear to be accepting reservations at this time... I know the one for the 27th in Austin is completely sold out, so that might be what's going on here.

true,tjm91,Selwyn,Selwyn,"I don't know what the procedure is specifically for international students, but in general this might be helpful:

1. Your grades will need to be as good as they can be. The typical offer to UK students is A*AA at A level, I'm not sure what that works out as in terms of GPA but it will be way up there.
2. If your grades are good enough you're very likely to get an interview, I think Cambridge interviews almost everyone who has the right kind of grades (though this may not be the case for international students).
3. You'll have to pick your subject before you apply, and base the application on why you want to study *that* specific subject. Cambridge offers Linguistics and MML (Modern&amp;Medieval Languages) and it sounds like those are the ones that'd interest you. However unlike the US where you can change your major alot, it's not expected that you'd change subject (you can but only a small minority do).
4. Look at all the courses you think you'd be interested in and look at the colleges you'd want to apply for. The university is split into several colleges and though most teaching is university-wide you'll live and spend alot of time in your college.
5. Interviews are really important. Interviewers will be looking for interesting people who aren't just capable at working but will get the most out of studying that particular subject. They want you to show interest and engagement, not just an ability to do well on tests.

You might well have already looked at it, but you can find out more here: http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/

And though it's unlikely to be an easy option, if you do happen to be in the UK at any point before applying, try and come to an open day or just visit the city to see if you really like the place.

You said you know you want to read Economics so I guess you're a) set on that and b) aware of what's needed for applying and, if you get in, actually doing the degree.

Also, I don't know if you've picked a college - visiting can be pretty helpful for that, just getting a feel for them or talking to people who know what it's like to be there can help you decide which might suit you best.

Marin injury was [confirmed in this article](http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2956565/title/level-setting-for-shakhtar). Had no idea he suffered another set back. Sure is made of glass, was thinking that might be a problem when I saw his extensive injury record from last season alone.

Couple of big games coming up soon in short succession, so with Terry back I think Luiz will be rested, as he's played more matches than Cahill. I think Ramires is preferred to Lampard, so we'll see Lampard tomorrow and Rambo for United. It's possible that Moses and/or Sturridge could also start tomorrow.

Was tough dropping a defender to have an adequate amount of midfielders and attackers - opted for Bertrand. Complete random choice, he is fit and available before anyone asks.

Finally, I've started working full time so it's difficult (near impossible) for me to sneak on and post during work hours. As such, I won't be able to handle updating the thread for cech_mate's match threads, you'll all have to find it on the sub yourself - shouldn't be too difficult.

That is some cowboy vengeance shit. Smith is apparently a real badass. 

I really have to thank you for taking the time to prove my point - the differences between the Doctors are subtle - after all, Moffat is not a blind-deaf quadruplegic who cannot read. He in fact wrote and produced some fantastic Doctor Who episodes. 

But that does not mean that there aren't subtle yet significant differences between Smith and those of his predecessors. 

As you point out, the Doctors are vastly different. I am a huge fan of Tom Baker, for example, but abhor Colin Baker and not so mad about Davison.

That kind of proves my point - I have taken the time to outline what I don't like about Smith/Moffatt, just as I can outline what I don't like about Davison/John Nathan-Turner, and this apparently is a problem.

Good news. One of the most talented programmers I've ever worked with had zero formal qualifications, and actually dropped out of school at age 14. The IT sector is particularly liberal, and employers place less value on formal qualification than in other industries, so you can get jobs on experience alone.

My advice to you, is to focus on learning 3-4 languages. Being versatile and capable of using a variety of languages will provide more job security than focusing on one language, which may or may not fall out of grace with the industry in a few years. Which langs you pick depend on what industry you want to go into.

I'm guessing you have limited IT qualifications. Consider getting involved in open source projects. You will be able to hone your programming skills while generating a portfolio of work that can demonstrate your ability to prospective employers.

You're going to struggle, I'm afraid. The IT sector is saturated with talent at the moment, and India's IT sector is rapidly growing. Nearly all of my programmer friends are worried about job security, as outsourcing continues to move jobs from the West to India.

That said, when I left the industry in 2006 it was moving the same way as programming with a lot of first line/telephone support jobs heading to India with the introduction of reliable remote support software, meaning that it was harder to get first line/junior posts and work your way up.  There was also a much lower focus on actually fixing problems at the user's desk.  Those first line guys that were left were reduced to dropping new desktops on desks and taking the old one away to have Windows re-imaged on it.  Or fixing printers.  Printers suck.  Printers suck balls.

I'd also say that for junior roles at least you'll be dealing with the same sort of crap you get in a call center only face-to-face with users taking their frustration out on you.  Not all the time obviously, but you need to have patience of a saint and a thick skin.

Walcott just seems to lack a footballing brain, in the same way Charlie Adam did - they're very very good at certain things, and are great when employed in a way that emphasises their natural gifts, but they don't have much else to their game. 

A really ambitious - but probably not feasible - move would be Erik Lamela at Roma. He's 20, he's a left-footed right-sided striker, with great dribbling, passing, and already has 3 goals in 7 games for Roma this season. He's not the best defensively, but if we're hoping Rodgers can teach Sturridge then we can hope the same here. But he's contracted until 2016, and I daresay won't be cheap, so it probably won't happen. :(

Jelle Vossen at Genk? Second-highest goalscorer in Belgium last season (21), and already has 5 this season. Good movement in the box, gets involved in build-up play, decent in the air, but could do with more physicality and strength. He's just 23, and even though he's on a long-term deal, he's at Genk (Belgian league), which shouldn't make it hard to get him for a reasonable fee. Might not be an immediate first XI player, but could definitely grow into one.

Tim Matavz has 8 goals in 9 games for PSV so far this season. He's 23, has great movement off the ball, is good in the air and has good pace and decent dribbling, though I'm not sure he's got the passing and link-up abilities we're after. 

Then there's the obvious links like Gary Hooper and Damiao, both of whom would fit what we're after, though the feasibility - especially of Damiao - remains to be seen.",0,1350977626,null,0,false,0,c6qft4g,t3_11vabx,t1_c6qft4g,t1_c6qfbbg,null,1430216588,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; Look, the man was dining with prime ministers and royalty, he must've been vetted to death.

I has been suggested that the Prime Minister in question was cut from the same cloth as Savile and that Savile was providing young boys for his pleasure.  If that's true then the issue of vetting is irrelevant - the PM not only didn't care, but was actively seeking out people with access to young children.  Looking at Wikipedia, it appears that Savile was given his OBE in 1972.  Who was PM at the time?

He was awarded a Papal Knighthood in 1990.  Presumably for services to molesting children.  Let's assume the Catholic Church knew about it and simply didn't care.  They treated him like one of their own.

Not sure about the Royalty connection, but finding out they've got other skeletons in their closet wouldn't surprise me in the least.

What bothers me are the other high-level connections.  He was close friends with Thatcher.  I can't believe that she wasn't aware of his reputation.  Why did she still associate with him?  Why did she give him a knighthood?  I can't believe she didn't know of his reputation, but still deemed him a close enough friend to have him round at Chequers for New Years Eve on 11 successive years.

Something doesn't add up.

&gt; It's bullshit that some people didn't know what he was up to.

I have to agree.  There were undoubtedly some very important people who must have known what he was up to.  I don't think it necessarily follows that *everyone* knew what he was up to.  For example, at Stoke Mandeville I think it's more likely that they didn't know, or needed the money too desperately to worry too much about ""niggling little doubts"".  Negligent, perhaps, but probably not deliberately malicious.

But I think you're right - the man had connections with the kind of people that make it their business to know the all dirty secrets of people they deal with.  It's almost inconceivable that they were all negligent.

So aside from Heath and the Papal connection where there's a plausible explanation as to why they would tolerate a suspected child abuser, what motive do the others have?  Are they also in the same game, or is Savile a pawn in a bigger game?

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well, you might be encouraged to learn that you’ve just described my career in that I was working in a call centre about 5 years ago and now I’m an IT contractor, soon to be giving up contracting to take a permanent position again.

Stroke of luck 1: 
Whilst working at the call centre a job came up as an assistant to the IT guy who was working there, I got this job on the basis that I knew my way around windows OS, could trace cables through an office and build a computer where necessary. The job was awfully paid (not much above minimum wage) but gave me experience to put on the CV. When I was lucky enough to be able to leave to go travelling due to a minor inheritance I came back to the UK far more employable than I’d been a couple of years before.

Stroke of Luck 2:
I went to interview for a first line support role and in the interview they told me that they actually had two roles available, one was the first line one and the other was a more specialised role using a particular ERP system, it was mostly data entry at first but developed over time and helped me to become something of an expert in the functional side of the software. I enjoyed that job for three years but wanted to relocate for personal reasons so I started looking for work.

Stroke of Luck 3:
The decision to start contracting was made for me as it’s very much the way the market is for ERP specialists. I was lucky in this instance to meet the best boss anyone could have at this stage of their career, he really taught me a lot of technical stuff and gave me all the help and encouragement I could want. The faith this one person showed in me is tremendous and I’m regarded as a technical expert in some areas as a result.

Now I’m coming to the end of my second contract position and I’m interviewing for permanent positions again, either in project management or development and it surprises me that I can ask for 3 times the salary I was earning only a few years ago. Apologies if this seems smug, I genuinely feel very humble and lucky to be where I am. Hopefully someday soon I’ll attain my lifelong goal of running a bicycle puppy delivery business.

TL;DR – It’s worth a go.

Of course, pharmaceuticals are different to most products in that 99% of costs are pre production, but if they can sell 10,000 pills for £50m, or 1,000 pills for £40m, they're better off selling more.

The skills STEM graduates are taught in university are NOT the skills STEM employers want.

For instance, I am an Engineer who works with CAD, and I consider myself lucky because CAD is one of the few ""industry"" crossovers where training happens. 

Yes being able to understand calculus and calculate beam stress/strain and understand hardness equations are all useful, but to be directly hire-able at 21 leaving university, it would be more useful for me to have worked in a machine shop.

The trick is that graduates have this high level knowledge that they need 5% of the time, but have ZERO of the knowledge that is required to actually do day-to-day STEM industry work, directly using the maths I've learnt only accounts for perhaps 5% of my time, but it IS essential I understand it.

In my field Physicists and Chemists are required in the same way, for their ""5% of the time"" knowledge, but only those who understand their gaping hole of practical experience will get anywhere.

I mentioned I consider myself lucky, because my boss understands this phenomenon of academia becoming more removed from industry and knows that spending the time building that industry knowledge will be essential in making me a good employee.

Fact is, Academia has no incentive to train STEM graduates in useful Industry skills, and therefore it either comes down to the graduate themself making up the slack (I was the ONLY mechanical engineer who chose Microprocessor Programming modules in about 5 years, and SO MANY others avoided CAD modules like the plague) or the university churning out STEM graduates who don't have what Industry is looking for.",0,1350993499,null,0,false,0,c6qhf4g,t3_11xs3s,t1_c6qhf4g,t1_c6qh0l1,null,1430217343,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,bluefold,null,null,"I have long been of the belief that the problem here is not that people want stuff for free, I'll admit that some people do, but it is a supply and pricing issue. 

First supply: Things are made too difficult to get a hold of. If I want to watch every back episode of classic Doctor Who there is no way I can legally do this. However pretty much any tracker out there will have ever single available episode. The reason I can't go on the BBC website and watch these episodes is not because they don't want to but because the other channels came out and bitched it would be anti-competitive to offer up the archive for free. 

Another issue is the disconnectedness of the content that is out there. Before Project Canvas, which eventually became YouView the BBC floated the idea of tying all these various catch-up TV services together onto one page. It made sense. But at every avenue, and when it became Project Canvas to bring this to TV sets, it was fought at every step first by the trust and then by BskyB and others because again it was 'anti-competitive'. So rather than one unified source, or even just a unified backbone, we have a hundred different websites each offering a different player and sign up page to get to the content. It is annoying to say the least.

The second, and main problem, is an overvaluing of content: 
What services like Netflix and Lovefilm prove is that people are more than willing to play a flat fee to access content. If I could access the entirety of the BBC's archive for £5 a month I would sign up in a heart beat. But this is not cost effective so they sell licences to the likes of Netflix and Lovefilm... which they have stopped buying because the BBC have decided that it is 'premium content. Netflix pays a million dollars for each episode of Mad Men they have on the US service so I can only imagine what the number they decided to pass on was.

It is a mindset that the BPI and their ilk needs to grow out of. Digital content != physical prices. I don't mind paying to support an artist or an industry but I do not want to pay to support an ageing antiquing business model. 

Perfect example, J.K. Rowling's new book The Casual Vacancy. It costs £9 for the hardback, a pretty reasonable price considering it is a thick book and takes up space and the manufacturing costs etc. But the ebook is £11. How in any way is that a fair price? It is because traditional publishing is scared at the way their industry is going and try to apply their old business model to this new market. I have easily spent over £100 on books this year and I have enjoyed the vast majority of them, only two have had a traditional publisher attached to them. 

tl;dr Piracy should not be fought not with exclusion but with inclusion. Convince me that I will get a decent product for a fair price and piracy will shrink dramatically. It will never vanish but neither will sharing my DVD collection with my friends.",0,1350994466,null,0,1351011258,0,c6qhjhz,t3_11xmia,t1_c6qhjhz,t3_11xmia,null,1430217400,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

Personally, If I didn't pirate stuff, I wouldn't have bought it anyway. In fact by me being introduced to their media through piracy, I'm more likely to spend money in the future when I have more disposable income.

Plus is it just me, but for music downloading, I've just being using Youtube MP3 Downloaders for like the past 6 years to get any music I want. Obviously that's harder to bulk download albums and discographies, but I rarely want the whole album of anything anyway, there's usually only one or two good tracks.

To look at how piracy on a mass-scale affects companies, you just have to look at China, they literally pirate everything there, with it freely available, cities usually have a public accessible FTP servers where you can download everything that exists but companies still make tons on money there from music,movies,games etc. L

The major reason for piracy being so popular and widespread now, is because the media is overpriced in the first place. They'd probably make more profits from the decent stuff if it was cheaper, but there's so much crappy stuff made that they can't justify that, and so just end up being greedy with prices.

Dont get me wrong I would love him here, but Huntelaar just doesnt fit into BR's plan and style in a number of areas, I know BR would much rather bring in a young up and coming striker that he can mould to play in our system, cost us much less and be with us for a long, long time.

And really - do you think an average person pays their own way in the UK? Median salary of the UK is £23k/yr right now. That's £4800/yr of tax, plus another average £600 in council tax and VAT too. Yet still, schooling a child costs ~£3000/yr per student, NHS costs £2500/person/yr. Not to mention all the other public spending.

Then consider that half of people earn less than £23k/yr, and that they also get benefits in some form or another. An average person has ""free"" education to 18, works for 40 years, then another 15-30 years of pension and tax exemptions. I'd say that the ""average"" person isn't even close to paying for everything. Granted we have corporation tax and other income sources, but these are just my rough calculations anyway.

You could also calculate it as the total UK budget divided by population (£682bn/65m people) which would be £10500 spent per person per year. But if you count out people under 16 and pensions, it's even crazier and clearly no average person is paying close to that amount. It's really no surprise that we have debt problems!

I'm fine with public spending, and I'm fine with tax. What I'm asking for is a sensible balance. People shouldn't be dependent on government.. it's incredibly unhealthy.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins_bibliography#Academic_papers

He has been published in science and nature on several occasions. To those not in Academia; this is the equivalent of being a premiership football player but for brains and research methodology.

He never uses this obvious authority to argue his position, it is always based in reason and evidence. Even if people don't agree with what he says or think he's ""smug"" or ""arrogant"" (which, to be fair, a lot of smart academics are) you should probably listen to him because there are very few men like him alive, he really is an incredible human being; much more so than celebrated people in the media spotlight like, say, Steven Fry and David Attenborough (not to diminish their reputations in the slightest). Furthermore, he's actually a pretty decent human being who holds himself to incredibly high moral standards.

Maybe he is smug, but I find it hard to dislike him. I do wish he'd write more science books instead of getting marred down in tedious religious arguments though, the Selfish gene and the extended phenotype should be on everyone's bookshelf; scientist or not.

Charlton seem to create few chances away from home but, like us, they score from them. So I fully expect us to concede - again. However, I'd like to think that we'll be able to score at least a couple of goals, especially with Hall bound to come on for his debut at some point. (I have a feeling that he gave Varney a chance to prove himself on Friday, but if he puts him on ahead of Hall again then I'm not going to be happy.)

Here's the line-up I expect:


---------------Kenny

Byram---Lees---Pearce---Drury

White---Brown---Austin---Tonge

---------------Diouf

---------------Becchio

Substitutes: Ashdown, Pugh, Green, Norris, Varney, Hall, Gray.

I have a feeling that he won't risk playing Peltier with two more games in such a short space of time on the way, and I'm actually quite fine about that. He's been too inconsistent: he had a great game against Barnsley and put in a poor performance (along with the rest of the team, in fairness) on Friday. On the other hand, I don't remember Drury having a bad game, but he seems incapable of playing twice a week. It will be interesting to see how the team gets on if Warnock does choose this.

I'm also expecting him to start with Austin again, despite the messages from the camp that Norris is pushing heavily for a start.

This is very different from trickle down, which says that you give more money to wealthy people through the tax code, they create economic activity, which then trickles down to make the rest of the population wealthier than they otherwise would have been. In this case, you are bringing in money from outside the country, not redistributing it from the lower ends of the tax brackets. That is fairly inarguably an economic benefit.

You are over-rating the capitalist class, perhaps!

That's a fairly weak argument. Over my lunch break I was looking at buying Adobe Creative Suite. but I don't have the expendable cash to do that, I'll be forced to use another package.  It's not like there aren't a million and one other solutions to it.  You can't justify just taking things that don't belong to you just because you'd have no intention of paying.  I'm sure if you turned up to a swimming pool and had a swim without paying, they'd be unimpressed. Or if you snook into a live gig without paying.  You're not technically stealing, because the water would  be there regardless, and the sound would be filling the room regardless, but it's still ethically wrong. Some people have worked hard to produce what you're going to 'consume' (okay, no technical consumption happens), and they deserve to be paid. You can argue how small a drop in the sea not buying a 79p Lady GaGa song from iTunes would be, but most content providers aren't as wealthy as people seem to think.

&gt; no one would DARE use Youtube to upload/download copyrighted material now would they?

YouTube has lots of measures in place to stop users from distributing copyrighted material.  A lot of bands and content work with that to provide advertisement supported content in order to help fund their production. An awful lot of songs, tv shows, movies get taken down fairly quickly.  While BitTorrent is a totally legitimate means of peer to peer(ish) file transmission, and should(and is) used all over the place - the history of TPB with piracy and intentionally distributing copyrighted material is the problem. No one at all is asking Canonical to remove it's Ubuntu torrents.

&gt; The people that torrent are either too young to have disposable income just yet and their parents are too old to have disposable income to get it for them

I'm going to get downvoted for this, but people don't have a right to content. Unfortunately we live in a Capitalist country, and content providers and producers have to afford to live.  If significant portion of parents don't have less than £1 to spend on a song for their child, I think we've a far more serious problem this conversation is touching on over copyright law.

&gt;But that song is always there in the background, on the radio, on Youtube, on torrents and it's going to be recorded/downloaded.

When a song is on a radio, you've paid a licence (in this country) to listen to it, but even then the song is *always* slightly watermarked by a station, either a DJ talking over some part, cutting the end with a jingle etc.  If you really like the song you could just keep listening to the station. They have request shows.

&gt; So now you get companies being set up to blackmail your ISP just because you downloaded thunder cats or something, people are in this business just to harvest money and it's not the artists, they won't see that money.

Yep. That's wrong.  Bullying 12 year olds because they've downloaded an album is disgusting.

&gt; Where are they getting money from to open useless court cases to block Pirate Bay?

I'm not in support of blocking websites.  I'm purely pointing out the double standards people seem to have when it comes to digital content vs physical consumable content.  

To be honest, it's all about price point if you look at Steam for example - setting the price to the correct level allowed Valve to become commercially successful in Russia - a country most companies gave up on due to piracy.",0,1351007706,null,0,false,0,c6qkadl,t3_11xmia,t1_c6qkadl,t1_c6qjqmr,null,1430218760,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

For us to have actual capitalism in it's purest hypothetical form, you need something called [perfect competition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition). Unfortunately, in the real world markets *aren't* perfect, and monopolies form. Monopolies are pretty much the opposite of a free market as they cause prices, supply and demand to become inefficient. So we have regulations to stop monopolies from forming. You could argue that the way our government is organised with lobbying and special interests causes market inefficiencies to appear, creating a form of broken capitalism.

As well as this, external problems like the environment and social inequality can distort what we actually need from markets. For example, the sustainable level of fishing is lower than that set by a free market, and so some regulation is needed.

Most economic theory accepts that you *need* a certain amount of regulation, and it's not even that difficult to find, it's just that different people don't like when the economy changes and their jobs become pointless or they don't make as much / enough money. You get things like the EU subsidising farmers to make [milk and butter that is far in excess of what we really need](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy#Oversupply_and_its_redistribution).

At first, I thought she was a good character, but as the series went on, she just became loud, brutish, and really got on my nerves. Perhaps the writing is more at fault htan her character, but by Series 6, it seems that she had become the main character of the show instead of the Doctor. it's as if the writers had just fallen in love with their character so much that she could no longer do wrong, and therefore had to be the centerpiece around which the show revolved. 

That being said, i did like Rory. I liked Rory a lot. I want to like Amy, and perhaps I would have had she not stuck around for so long. As a watcher only of the new series, I was used to companions coming and going; and having this one character stick around for so long and suddenly begin monopolizing the show I felt seemed strange.

We still have no clue what our strongest lineup is.  This is a problem.

Vertonghen and Dembele have been fantastic, Sigurdsson and particularly Dempsey have not.

In my opinion, we really need BAE back and Adebayor starting games in form and with a good attitude.  I love Defoe's contribution so far but he would be a much more effective substitute for us at this point.  Having Parker available would also be a huge boost.

I have to agree, and it really isn't that striking until you look at it that way.  We have played well in the majority of the matches we have played so far, but even when playing well, we never really have seemed to get ourselves into a good rhythm of play.  We seem to be playing every match as if it is the first of the season, we don't seem to have enough chemistry as a team.

I seem to recall that blackmail, or the threat of it, was a common theme in both those shows (not that I'm suggesting they necessarily present an accurate portrayal of how politics works - you might think that, but I couldn't possibly comment).

&gt; Today it is very easy to find information on someone as we have a huge amount of information in databases

True.  The digital age certainly makes it easier to share information, but don't forget that someone has to get hold of the information in the first place before it can be put into any databases.  I imagine that then, as now, some damning evidence against Savile could easily have been obtained by basic surveillance.

[EDIT: not literally right now because he's dead]

&gt; its likely that the people who knew it was going on didn't think it was a big deal, and that the majority of people who didn't know it was happening would never even consider it as a possibility.

Fair point.  Not sure I agree, but it's certainly plausible.

The Netflix model obviously caters to these motives nicely.

With all this in mind, I disagree with you when you say things like ""It is a mindset that the BPI and their ilk needs to grow out of"" and they've overvalued their content.

I've done a little research on this a few years back (nothing academic just personal curiosity), and found that the last Olympic games to turn a profit and provide lasting benefit was LA. The reason being that everyone was so sick and tired of handing money over the Olympics and not getting anything back no one wanted to host it. LA agreed to, but only if they could dictate terms. Consequently they bent the Olympics committee over a barrel and forced them to use existing facilities and accept other cost saving measures.

After posting the profits, suddenly everyone wanted to host again under the belief it was profitable and thus it become unprofitable again as the committee got to dictate terms.

The games where an 8-9 billion pound ego boost. Nothing more. There will be no lasting benefit, and certainly no benefit outside of London.

true,rugggg,flair3,,"I agree on BAE and Ade, but i'd disagree regarding out strongest lineup. I think we know what it is, or at least a few slight variations of it. The only place we don't have resolved is Dempsey/Siggy, but frankly I think were just as strong with either one in. The issue is that our defense has injuries to two of our starting four, plus a key backup. Kaboul, BAE, Naughton. And missing Scotty P means we don't have a third cdm/cm to rotate/sub in and that's why we're seeing Livermore so often.

All being healthy it would be Ade, Bale, Dempsey/Siggy, Lennon, Dembele, Sandro, BAE, Jan, Caulker, Walker, Lloris. With Defoe and Parker as our first sub on depending on the situation.

I'd expect to see Kaboul starting when he's back and that may mean Caulker or BAE gets dropped out, but Caulker has been fantastic so far. 

I disagree that the ""modric replacement' is our issue. Dembele has been spectacular and has certainly filled the creator/ controller role. We do need another class CM to control and create when Dembele is out as Saturday really showed how crucial he is to the squad.

January needs to see us bring in depth on the wings before anything else. With the system AVB has us playing we can play Ade, Defoe or even Dempsey up top sucessfully as long as space is created via the wings and outside of Bale/Lennon and maybe Andros, we don't have anybody to do that.

The above ""economics"" commentary is a) typical b) worthless.

As long as any system of exchange tolerates speculation that is disconnected from a productive enterprise, that system will end up with the predatory gap-widening fuckfest we have right now.

As long as someone can make money by simply *having* money there is no escape from the gap.

Compound this with a fake system that arbitrarily prints the units of abstract exchange in the first place - especially as part of a loan arrangement that is mathematically impossible to repay (eg. that of the arrangement between the Federal Reserve bank and the US government) - and it's pretty obvious why things are so fucked.

Anyone who tells you that this is simplistic and that 'it's much more complicated' is either ignorant, invested in the status quo or deluded.

There can only be one economy that doesn't assfuck the civilisation that subscribes to it: that of raw energy. The universe does not print Newtons, Joules or Watts.

Physics is the only real economy; all the other systems are means of control.

If we don't exterminate ourselves we will inevitably see our flawed, corrupt economics shift to embrace this final paradigm. The only issue for debate is how soon.

What the fuck are you talking about? You want to bring 'reality' into it? Well you can just go tell everyone we're getting rid of banking, investment and money altogether then. Good luck with that, mate. I'll be in the real world with the rest of the people that are looking at actual fucking solutions to problems, rather than grand ideas of changing *literally everything about our society overnight*.

Realistically, capitalism in its various forms is the reason we're communicating right now. You want to tell me who would have built and designed and researched the computer you're typing on, and built and maintained the insane infrastructure it takes to even *have* the internet without a system of monetary incentive? Have you seen [growth graphs](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Maddison_GDP_per_capita_1500-1950.svg/350px-Maddison_GDP_per_capita_1500-1950.svg.png) of western countries since industrialisation began two hundred years ago?

As I said, there are problems with unrestrained markets that require regulation. One of these is *obviously* the banking system creating money in an unsustainable loop. Congrats on working that one out. It does **not** mean that having money doesn't work. By that rationale you might as well chuck out anything that doesn't work perfectly rather than fixing it.

Logic: Government isn't working, fix the government

Libertarian logic: Government isn't working, GET RID OF THE GOVERNMENT

&gt;Anyone who tells you that this is simplistic and that 'it's much more complicated' is either ignorant, invested in the status quo or deluded.

You'd have the expertise on being deluded then. You don't just get rid of the organisation that prints money, it's either a central bank or the government, or *you don't have money*. Money has to be printed or the supply runs out, **and** you lose a serious amount of control over the value of your money.

Now we're crossing the ball more than ever to a striker that isnt there, it's fine and well having Suarez in the trequartista role which he does brilliantly but it means we have no one in the box at the times when we break down the defence. 

If we don't end up signing another striker in Jan. I honestly think we have enough centre midfielders to push Stevie G into the striker role like he did under Rafa when Torres was injured.

As far as i'm concerned the reason he wasn't found out while alive was that Saville was a very manipulative and calculating man and no human made system on earth is going to stop someone with his abilities and resources from doing exactly what he did.

A lot of the venues were partially or entirely temporary (the top part of the stadium can be removed, reducing seating from 80,000 to 25,000; the basketball arena was entirely temporary), and the contracting firms worked in partnership with ODA (Olympic Delivery Authority I think it was, cba to get my notes out again) such that they trained locals to be apprentices to work on the site. They trained something like 1800 people, and only 450 of those went on to work at the olympic village, the rest went on to work elsewhere in London. The entire site is wheelchair accessible, no areas have a steeper incline than 1 in 20. Chobham Academy within the athlete's village will be turned into a school, and the catchment area for the school will give priority to residents currently living there, rather than those that will move in as the site continues to develop.

A lot of money went into removing contaminants from the site (they washed 800,000 cubic metres of soil to remove pollution, for example), and also taking down electrical pylons and installing cables underground. Everything was 'overdone' so that the area could be used again in the future. They put down cables to support much more infrastructure than was ever present during the olympics/paralympics, so that future housing etc. could benefit from it. They did all this so it would be more than just the games; the focus was never mainly on the games. A lot of the focus was directed towards the legacy, where did you get this idea that the money was just flittered away? Serious consideration was put into socio-economic impacts and the time after the games.

I haven't looked at other games in-depth yet, but London made a real effort to not let the olympics just be a white elephant of temporary honeypot tourism.

true,rugggg,flair3,,"Ok, I agree on Dembele not being a Modric type, I may have phrased that wrong. My point was that with Dembele in the squad our midfield can dominate, we may not have a Modric deep lying player maker/creator, but Dembele can dominate both driving forward and defending. 

He can control the midfield in a different way but one that has worked well for us so far. And this is only with a few matches with most of the pieces in place.

I believe that the team and system as a whole can allow us to control the game, the drives and one two's are what AVB wants to play. By pressing high and quickly shifting from defense to offense we can control and overwhelm our opponents. Sandro makes a tackle and breaks up the attack in front of our defense, Dembele picks up the ball drives forward, dishes it out to Jan breaking up the left, Jan plays it for Bale to run down, Bale picks it up runs at the defense and plays a danger ball into the box or cuts in and has a rip. That type of play will be gold for us and cause massive problems for opponents. (See Man U at Old Trafford for reference)

Would a Modric type controller/creator be great to field as well? Sure as hell it would be and picking up Moutihno in January would be massive. If that were to happen I could see us going to a a 4-3-3 with the midfield triangle of Moussa, Sandro and Moutihno at the point. The point is we have the capability to be a great team in either scenario and I'd expect to see a considerable upswing in the squad as a whole over the next two weeks as we get players back and become fully comfortable in the system, and then another upswing in January as Scotty P is back, and possibly Kaboul as well as whoever gets brought in, (Moutihno, Willian, Llorente etc).",0,1351023172,null,0,false,0,c6qonc6,t3_11y66r,t1_c6qonc6,t1_c6qnq85,null,1430220851,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Shaktar----------7

Chelsea----------4

Juventus---------3

Nordsjælland------1

2 Home games left vs Shaktar and Nords and 1 away vs Juventus. 

Ideal situation would be for Shaktar to continue winning while Chelsea beats Shaktar at the home leg. We've been in worse positions than this.

Today we lacked finishing and really never got a foot in the game and to be honest Shaktar were the much better side. We can point to the fatigue, crappy pitch or the idiot ref but I think they deserved to win today. It is in games like these that Drogba used to rescue us while we played like crap but now we need the entire midfield to click or else we cannot get that out of the blue win. To get far in the champions league we will need to rely more on our strikers playing like strikers or else we wont go very far. We can praise Torres for every 1/5 good things he does but when the chips are down that is not good enough. He loses the ball far too often and always runs to the right wing whenever we are breaking through leaving midfielders to play the striker role while he decides to send in a poor cross, why does he even need to do that? Make a striker's run and go down the middle or at least stay within shooting range.

I'm not really angry at the lads but just disappointed. The Spurs match is still on my laptop so that will cheer me up and I have faith in them that they will get through to the next stage. Going further than that though, we will need someone upfront to take charge.

Cech: Great performance. How anyone can continue to think that his injury affects his game disturbs me

Ivanovic: Mostly positive, came out with some clutch tackles. Crossing could be improved, but he did get an assist 

Luiz: Not a great night, had a few silly fouls and was probably was at fault for conceding. Clearing the ball was a weak point.

Terry: Same criticisms as Luiz. Didn't organize the defense like we're used to him doing. 

Cole: Also defended poorly, didn't add much in attack which would have given Chelsea some much needed width. Gave away possession too often.

Lampard: No basis for judgement. The injury is unfortunate, but at least our team doesn't need him anymore. 

Mikel: Mikel continued a run of excellent performances. He broke up play, made good tackles, and kept possession well. I don't feel bad for the team-I feel bad for him.

Ramires: Also a really solid performance, highlighted by a number of really good challenges and hard work off the ball. Also had himself a nice shot on goal.

Mazacar: I'll deal with all three here. Width was again a problem with this setup, though we knew that before. The incisive and precise passing that we have seen from them in previous games didn't really come off, though Shaktar defending was really good. I think that in cases like these it wouldn't hurt to have more shooting attempts. Test the goalkeeper, and good things tend to happen.

Torres: I'll not be as negative as others here. Torres's game was a mixed bag. He was again positive in build up play, but horrid in front of goal. He only had a few clear but difficult chances but we'd expect him to score those once in a while, which he hasn't. It deserves mentioning that he kept possession very well with good skill after Shaktar's goalkeeper made a good save and Torres was isolated. Deserved to be subbed. 

Sturridge: Wasn't involved a whole lot. He did have himself a shot or two, which is better than nothing. Deserves to rotate into the squad every few games.

Overall, this could have been a lot worse. Still in a good position in the group, but hopefully the boys can learn a lesson and come back to beat Man U this weekend",0,1351026817,null,0,false,0,c6qpre1,t3_11yrop,t1_c6qpre1,t3_11yrop,null,1430221362,8,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,8

true,spudboyblues,present,Mata,"We were thoroughly outplayed today. Clearly. A lot really went sour from the Tottenham fixture, but some positives:

* Mikel and Cech saved our asses today. Cech takes MoTM, but Mikel is a damn close second.

*    Sturry looks bright when he comes on. Even in the goal he scored against Tottenham, you saw him move into the space that Torres was thinking too long to attack and poached the fourth. Selfish? Maybe. Creating chances? Scoring goals? You bet. Time to see more of him. 

Wild cards: looked like a shitty or slicked pitch. Players were sliding around all over the place, and indeed that's what caused Lampard's injury. Poor form from Shaktar, but by no means an excuse. Same thing goes for the Ref: poor officiating isn't an excuse but it was there in full force today. Anybody else feel like we're consistently getting shafted by the officials...?

Now for everything else:

*  Sluggish, lethargic, hung-over, jet-lagged, whatever. Our players on the whole were a step behind. First goal was WAY too soft, and I thought resulted from Terry's rustiness. If we're going to play him in Champions League ties, he damn well better be fresh from the first whistle. That said, Luiz was pretty cavalier in his clearances, which did not help matters at all. Cole and Iva both looked tired. Maybe we'll see Bertrand and Azpi soon enough. 

* Second goal again came from sloppy play and a picked pocket in the midfield. That sort of laziness can't happen. I hope RDM talks some sense into the boys

* The Mazacar team was off their game today. Whether they were riding a little too high from past results or were just tired, they were off. And it's sort of scary to see that RDM was unsure how to react in that situation. IMHO, prior to the goal Oscar was the worst of the three, and I would have been happy to see Moses come on at or before the hour mark (maybe even at the half), as a battering ram type winger might have just stretched Shaktar's back four enough to squeeze chances in. This is something to watch carefully as we move forward. Oh and it'd be fucking lovely if Marin didn't decide to be injured for months on end. Just saying. 

* Torres. I've defended him before, and probably will again. But today was poor from him, and I think the stats belie his form at this point. The only *really* good piece of work he's done this season, to me, was the goal at Arsenal. I don't know about calling for his head quite yet, but the man needs to step up in big game situations. He had chances. He had balls played in behind him. If he had even taken one of his chances in the first half, which a good striker in form would have, we might be talking about a different result. If this continues I hope we see more of Sturry. 

At the end of the day, we can't win them all, and Oscar ultimately came good and saved our away goals/head-to-head ratios. However, I would have liked to have seen us give 100% instead of 75%. Time to wake up and smell the coffee before the two Manchester fixtures, because we were thoroughly outplayed today by a team that, if we're serious about a deep run, we should be beating, even away. 3 points next time at the Bridge v Shaktar is also a must. We're Champions. Time to show how Champions show resilience and determination. Another performance like today can't happen, and I truly hope RDM makes that crystal clear.

true,[deleted],null,null,"What I got from this is that he is similar to our current owners only that they differ on what is 'too big a task', whereas he thinks he can do enough to compete if given wage cap/limit and a start where he doesn't have to use 100s of million to build stadium. Our current owners think they can close that gap with their commercial and business plan.

Even if he is owner in a different sport, you can see what he says makes sense. Fans today don't appreciate stability enough, managers are not allowed to build teams and are fired before half the team are their own (i.e promoted or bought).

National teams fire managers, clubs fire managers or buy jan. in order to stop their relegation battle, players are expected to shine in the first season and the second season is must.

I don't think Rodgers is the best manager we could have gotten short term, I don't think these owners are the best we could have gotten short term, but they are perfect for us. For Brendan we are great team that when he succeeds he won't feel the need to overstep (Mou, where success led him to demand more than he was given at the start), he will have worked in that system for so long it won't require change, he knows there are boundaries to wages and transfers and they are only lifted with success. Our owners bought us when our value was bottom, they have no need to sell us in short term, and so we can feel at ease about them hanging on to their plan until at least we are stable on the pitch.

This part is what I will take from this article as the rest isn't as relevant to LFC:
&gt;Kraft says: “One of my things is continuity and stability always gives you a better chance for success. The coach and the quarterbacks are probably the most important people in our system.

&gt;“This is my 19th season as an owner and I’ve only hired two coaches and I’ve had two quarterbacks. I believe it’s either the oldest or the next to longest relationship going in the NFL. You’ve got to pick good people. Everyone goes through hard times whether it’s a marriage, a relationship, a business relationship. If you have people with solid core values in the first place usually you go through some tough times before you have the good times.

&gt;“We live in a world with texting, tweeting and emailing. People want instant success and gratification and they lose the ability to build a relationship that really can make that happen. I have to be disciplined and I try to resist fan pressure. It’s worked for me so I will continue to do it.” ",0,1351028771,null,0,false,0,c6qqbjd,t3_11yq4s,t1_c6qqbjd,t3_11yq4s,null,1430221625,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

I don't know what happened or if they could have done more, i do think that now it's come to light it's absolutely vital that we look into the situation very seriously.  Certainly it could be the case that other people are currently hiding behind the same wall so silence, certainly there are others who have always been under the same aspersions; Freddie Starr for example, someone is working to keep any 'libel' out of his wikipedia page; unfortunately this has included some fully sourced claims being removed leaving only half the story, if something as open as wikipedia can fall prey to this then it's pretty clear that a news room within an old-boys network is hugely at risk from it.  
  
If there are people in any official organization thinking to themselves 'oh people just think he's weird because he ate a hamster, they'll say anything about a celebrity...' then they're being a part of the same problem which let Jimmy Savile and others get away with so much.

Can certainly apply this to several players.  

&gt; I don’t really watch the ball at all. I watch the players. I watch their body language – how they hold themselves, their movement, their vocals etc. Are they hiding or are they showing for it? Are they on their toes, as athletic and dynamic as they usually are? Are they winning the same amount of challenges on the deck and in the air as normal? Are they being vocal? Are they focusing on the referee or their game? Are they keeping the same intensity throughout the game – if not is that deliberate or are they letting the game dictate their intensity?

Carroll immediately comes to mind.  Just picturing last season I couldn't even count the number of times I watched him pick himself up off the ground after failing to do anything useful with the ball, with a distressed look on his face.  He never really looked comfortable.

&gt; The more intense you are the more you suffer from tunnel vision. 

Suarez.  Sometimes it works and he pulls something [like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zMrD8IS9E) off.  Other times you can just see himself becoming utterly furious with himself as he fails to put a shot on target after beating 3 defenders and that frustration follows him all game compounding with each failed attempt.

This business with Walker is nonsense anyway, every player has a drop in form and he is still young and learning. He just needs to sharpen up on awareness and positioning as he gets caught out so often, and relying on pace will only get him so far.

As for the season, if anyone remembers my previous posts then they will know i'm not a massive Villas-Boas fan, but he is doing well at the moment. I just need convincing that we can sustain it over the season. But the problem for me is more the team itself, as we seem to lack creativity now Modric and VDV are gone, especially against teams that only have the intention of sitting back an counter attacking, its horribly recognizable. 

The more worrying point is that without Bale and Dembele we look totally different. On Saturday we couldn't hold the ball, pass it properly or create the scale of chances we have been used to over the years for a majority of the game.

They also apply this interview style to everyone when if they are going to act that way it should be dependent on the who they're interviewing. The BBC is payed for by the public so they should represent us and therefore shouldn't treat decent people fighting for just causes in the same way as manipulative, deceptive politicians exemplified by this interview: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biJgILxGK0o

The BBC also has a deliberate style of interview where they come from no perspective of truth under the guise of being 'unbiased' and schizophrenically try and undermine everything the person they interview says. This gives a sense of false equivalency where they'll equally interrogate people who should be handled totally differently. 

A good example is when the farmers were striking over milk prices and the BBC would interview them just as or if not more accusatorily as the supermarkets giving the false impression that both arguments had the same weight when the farmers were basically being ripped off.

true,HiddenText,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"Single people who are only claiming for themselves are hardly ever the people being referred to when it comes to ""living the easy life on benefits"".

When people talk about the people who are living on benefits instead of working it is almost always a family with kids who get more in benefits via JSA, rent/council tax, and child benefit than they would if one adult in the family group had a full time minimum wage job.

Any single person living on their own, or even with a partner and no children would be far better off financially working instead of claiming JSA, but throw a couple of kids into the mix and a bigger and more expensive house and rent and the council tax bill and the extra child benefits that come with it, and they are better off not working.

The main part of that benefit is rent and council tax, something over which the claimants have virtually no control. The only control that they exercise there is the ability to move, and that's not exactly easy while living on benefits.

Many landlords across the country have raised their rent to the maximum of what the government will pay, because they know they will always get people to pay it. Why do they know people will pay it? Because the governments of the previous years have managed to sell off a ton of council houses, shrinking the council house numbers and meaning that a lot of council tenants have to rent from private landlords because they now have no other choice.

Yeah, he looked weird in later life, because the track suits from his marathon running didn't make sense any more, and he never worked out that the glasses looked ridiculous. But when you live your whole life as a duplicitous lie, the image in the mirror can't be much help.


The BBC aren't collectively shitting their pants, but rather there's a lot of individuals who are.

Those who heard rumours, who had vague suspicions about what was going on, but who turned a blind eye or simply didn't think anyone would believe them (even though that was probably the correct assessment to make). Where this crossed the line into possible legal liability depends on exactly what happened, what laws regarding child protection were in place at the time, and so on. For example, if someone wilfully ignored allegations about Gary Glitter...well, that's a convicted offender who is still alive, so that is something the police may well wish to investigate.

At the same time, those currently at the top of the BBC are trying to protect themselves, while also aware that the Tories and many parts of the press love *any* reason to batter the institution, let alone a valid one. The BBC *has* to have indepence for editors from the influences above, otherwise it comes close to being a state broadcaster. The story as it currently stands suggests that this separation broke down in this instance, due to the planned tributes.

Because he expensive to come, and awkward to go, rather high, little slow,

And that's all that really mattered to me.

Put a ball at the back of the net, pulled his trigger, then he said.

But now you won't even let me fucking plaaay.

Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.""

Sends shivers down my spine,Allerdyce thinks he's mine

Goodbye, ev'rybody, I've got to go,

Gotta leave you all behind and score some goals.

true,AiliaBlue,eccleston,Eccleston,"I always thought of it as a choice thing. Much like when the Doctor's unconscious, the translation matrix doesn't work. If the Doctor chooses not to share a specific language, it doesn't translate. With regards to the Judoon at the Shadow Proclamation, he didn't want Donna to know what he was really saying for some reason, probably a secret handshake (like someone else said) or declaring something about himself/his past he wanted to keep private. So the TARDIS does the heavy lifting, but he knows all the languages. I know this is probably from fanfic, but I've always liked to think that he's speaking English (he obviously knows it, he's only spent around half of his life added up) and the TARDIS wouldn't translate Gallifreyan, much like the symbols on his console. This way he gets privacy. :)

true,BrokenClockwerk,lfc50,,"Huntelaar is an exceptional player, one of the best strikers in the world right now. He's a bit older than we'd like (although, we did go for Dempsey, who is 5-6 months older), and he has the quality of a Falcao or an Aguero. I would love him at Liverpool just because I believe he is a player who could really help carry us when he's in form. Being a team built around one player never works in the long run, but in a season or two, it certainly can, especially when another player is out of form (RVP during the first half of Arsenal's season last year, Torres for us, albeit with more mixed results, some of the time).

That said, I do think it represents a risk. If we can get him on a free next season, we'll have to consider a few things. If by some crazy cosmic accident we finish top 4 this season, we don't really need Huntelaar. We will have the money from Carroll and presumably a few other players for Rodgers to mold the squad how he likes. If we don't make top 4, I think Huntelaar would still consider us, but we would likely lose Sahin. Retaining Suarez, Agger, Lucas and Reina (unless we replace him with Vorm or someone else) would be extremely important in the offseason. At that point, it becomes very important to bring in a player like Huntelaar, but if we lose another key player, we're still in a tight spot.

If we bring him in during January, we have a much better chance of doing well in the league, and could realistically consider top 5 and hope for top 4. However, if Shalke is going to hold us ransom for something like 25 million for a player on a six month contract, and Huntelaar wants huge wages, it would be a horrible economic decision. Everyone in the world knows that we need a striker and expects us to overpay for one, and we don't want a repeat of the Carroll situation. We need to be fiscally responsible and I don't know if 25 million and 80k/week is responsible.

tl;dr We will have funds next summer for Rodgers to improve the squad more in line with his views (more adaptable, younger, cheaper) than Huntelaar. If we try in January, we will not be the only team looking for his signature and Shalke will probably try to screw us on a transfer fee. We need to balance our need for short-term success with a long-term ambition, and many situations involving Huntelaar may not do that.

Also he is handsome, so that is a +1 for me.",0,1351055143,null,0,false,0,c6qx1mc,t3_11xv78,t1_c6qx1mc,t3_11xv78,null,1430224862,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,Intrinsically1,lfc50,,"Fun facts:  Guus Hiddink apparently received an honorary South Korean citizenship, free flights for life on a Korean airline, a villa on a private island and a World Cup stadium renamed in his honor after his incredible WC run with South Korea in 2002.

He then went on in 2006 to take Australia (a country who had only ever qualified for the WC once in the 70's) on to make it to the 2nd round of the WC (beating out Japan and Croatia in the group stage to qualify along with Brazil) only to get knocked out after conceding [this penalty](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkOuuIpfXNs) against Italy in the last minute of penalty time.

He also managed Chelsea in the latter half of the  2008/2009 season where he won all but one league game against Tottenham as well as knocking Juventus and LFC (that year probably our strongest team in the Premier League to date) out of the Champions League, only to get knocked out by Barca (the eventual winners).  He walked away from a guaranteed contract from Abramovic to finish his contract with the Russian national team.  

The guy is IMO a criminally underrated manager who has a penchant for taking on challenging jobs. Anzhi have a fair few high calibre players and a Roman Abramovic-esque manager who appears to be mid process of implementing the same style of business model (read: bottomless pockets and shady FFP loopholes).

My point was, when it comes to overall explanations of why things are fucked and what it will take to eliminate the issues altogether, is that it is completely masturbatory to discuss solutions *based in the status quo*.

The status quo *is* the problem.

Speculation (in the fiscal sense, in the unlikely event this is being misinterpreted) *is* the problem.

As long as one can make money by having money, resources/power/control/more money will coalesce at the top [of this Ponzi scheme we call global economics] and it'll be repeatedly justified by the quaint paradigm of the 'trickle-down effect.'

I repeat:

It is completely masturbatory to discuss solutions for the status quo that are *based in the status quo*.

You are right to then ask, ""how do we transition, then?""
I completely understand that point, as we intuit that the shift must take place as part of a continuum of the economic model we have, because that isn't going anywhere while there's profit to be made.

I have no answer to this. Something has to happen to make the current system not worth exploiting. I think we're talking asteroids and armageddon, really, or perhaps some sort of singularity.

Meanwhile, the rich get richer, the predation continues.

&gt; As I said, there are problems with unrestrained markets that require regulation. One of these is obviously the banking system creating money in an unsustainable loop. Congrats on working that one out

See, you - in some capacity - agree. It's just not what you wrote beforehand. What you wrote beforehand was a response under the predominant paradigm, which is fine and has its uses, especially day to day.

I merely wanted to pull back the curtain because most people do not realise there's a curtain in the first place. Most people don't really understand what a paradigm is. Most people just eat the words of economists as if it's science. (I find that in itself pretty disgusting).

If people took the red pill on meaningful subjects more frequently, then everyone would have that extra perspective.

For example - and to chime with your comment about how ""capitalism"" has boot-strapped our civilisation - are you aware of the biological fact that our species is based on historical rape? Our entire generation exists becasue somebody further up the tree raped someone.

Not all bases are immediately useful for the future. Profit before (objective) progress? aka. capitalism?

There's a new echo-chamber whence resounds this banal sentiment. 

The relationship between an organisation and the individuals within it is complex. To some extent individuals use their individual judgement to make individual decisions. At the same time, organisations have cultures which affect the individuals within it to act within certain accepted parameters. There are pressures to conform in any human organisation and the nature of the human ape is pretty favourable to cooperating within groups.

There are no artificial flavourings, and the salt content is only what occurs in the vegetables naturally, so it'll barely register.

If you got a bit of money and you don't mind spending over 100 quid for a meal try the Gingerman it's a cracking restaurant and food is epic. 

Apart from the usual chains like Giraffe, Wagamamas, Cote there are some good smaller restaurants that do great food you just need to do some exploring.

Here are a few I recommend:
Pho it has great Viatnamese food in there, good friendly staff too.There is also a Jamies Italian next door which is walk in only. Not tried that one my self though.

If you are in the North Laines area there is a new Mexican street food place. called La Choza it has some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. It's street food style so really food for a big lunch.

If you like Indian food there are a couple of places to try. The first is right where I live called the Raj Pavillion its unofficially the best Indian in Brighton it's a little far out though. The other is the Chilli Pickle in town, its hard to get in there though its pretty popular

If you like seafood try English's awesome restaurant. You wont find anything else like it. :P

Bars and pubs are hard to recommend as there are so many that just kick ass. For normal pubs good for beer/ale chilling out I recommend: Fortune of War, The globe, The 3 and 10, Wagon and Horses, Fountain Head. The Office(Also does great Thai food).
For bars with a more active nightlife check out The Mesmerist, great pub and usually has live music like blues or jazz and has great beer and cocktails. Most pubs and bars are lively though. 

The pier is good fun if you can get on and the arcades are laugh.

I would recommend avoiding the road called West Street at night on Friday and Saturday its usually where the riff raff end up. :)
