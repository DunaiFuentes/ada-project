At that point, for me, he can go. I want players who give a shit about this club and play like it. I don't want someone who puts a personal eye-for-eye feud over what's good for the team. 

We're a Premiership side still. We've got an owner willing to invest money and a manager who knows how to build a team for the long-term. This summer, unlike the last, we'll have more than just a few days to buy players. And being honest, although Barton has had his really good days, he's had more than a few really bad ones as well.

Had Barton not done what he did in the City game I wouldn't mind him staying. But now that he has we can might as well make the most of it and try to get another, better, player to take his place. 

If I had my way, therefore, we'd terminate his contract as soon as possible, and start looking for a replacement.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"As someone who has seen all on Netflix of both MLP and their offerings of Doctor Who, may I say that the two are *not alike in any way whatsoever*.

Netflix's algorithms are based off of viewer recommendation and MLP's fringe demographic happens to overlap with the demographics of Doctor Who. This recommendation does nothing to reflect the actual quality of the content of MLP *or* the similarities between the two shows.

Speaking personally unlike Doctor Who, MLP's plots are shallow, predictable, and derivative.

It's characters are oft repeated cliches like ""honest farmhand with southern accent"" and ""athlete with a need for speed"" and ""shy animal-lover"" and ""bouncy cloudcuckoolander"" and ""sensible academic protagonist"".

It's plots are ones that have been done by countless children's shows like ""character suspects friends no longer like them while they are actually planning a surprise party"" and ""character gains love of 'nerdy' hobby while injured and attempts to feign the injury to keep hobby and hide it from friends but learns that being 'nerdy' is okay"" and they rarely deviate from the predictable norms.

The only references they'll make are ones that have safely been made by other, more successful shows hundreds of times like the ""rabbit season, duck season"", ""yakety sax"", and ""I Love Lucy conveyor belt"" gags.

Not that it's a bad show. It's perfectly fine for children's programming. But unlike Doctor Who this show won't explore deep or rewarding themes like life, death, the nature of reality, or anything that will really entertain beyond colorful distraction.

If you really want a *good* recommendation, go watch Netflix other fare like Firefly, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Red Dwarf, and many more.",0,1337310968,null,0,false,0,c4pe8rq,t3_tspya,t1_c4pe8rq,t3_tspya,null,1428948778,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

One memory that sticks out: This was a year before Xabi Alonso was sold to Real, and there will all sorts Gareth Barry joining up. My initial reaction was that I'd rather have Xabi Alonso than Barry, and he agreed. Then, when I saw him two or three weeks later, he had watched hours and hours of film and broke down how he thought Barry would actually be a good fit into the team at the time based on Barry's style, specifically his positioning and tackling. Of course, we ended up with neither Barry nor Alonso, and though he never wrote about the LFC midfield situation, he struck me as very professional, very thorough and level-headed guy. I think he's been good for SI.com, whose coverage and group of writers have struck a good balance between MLS and Europe (and not just Prem, with articles on Spain, Germany, Italy as well).

Seriously though, what his role will include is damage control, formal announcements, PR releases and so on. 

For example, when Tevez held up the sign saying ""RIP Fergie"" the comms department released a statement saying *""This was a poor decision and Mr Tevez apologises""*.

Think of when the claims first emerged about Suarez vs Evra. Director of comms should have been on that like mana from heaven, releasing a formal statement almost immediately that *""even though Suarez was not aware of the full context of this word in the English language, he fully understands that Mr Evra was very offended by it and apologises wholeheartedly.""*

Then, its over to Evra to accept the apology or continue the claims. 

Instead we had the shambles of Dalglish saying it never happened, saying Evra had previous cases of these racism claims, the tshirts being worn and so on. Whether or not all of that was true matters not. What it did was tarnish the image of the club.

This is more of a mid-season effect. Examples to the contrary - see, Alex McLeish at Villa, Hodgson with us, Inter with Gasperini, Chelsea under AVB (did OK, but not excellent play), etc. etc.

&gt; I expect two or three of the fan favourite players to leave/retire now that Kenny is gone. Could be anyone, from Agger to Suarez, Carragher to Reina.

It depends on who the new man is and the talks he has with them. The three most at risk are Suarez, Reina and Skrtel, because Suarez &amp; Skrtel are currently in contract talks (although Suarez's current deal still runs for another 4-odd years), and Reina because he might finally be fed up. But who knows. I think it's feasible that we can get through the summer without losing any of them, but that's the ideal scenario

&gt; The current squad is built heavily around a 442. I don't expect the new manager will play that.

The Girl in the Fireplace; When Madame De Pompadour is looking out at the stars, excited and waiting for the Doctor to return soon to take her on an adventure...but he is too late.

Doomsday; Obviously it's the 'wall to wall' and Bad Wolf Bay scene. Just the look in the Doctor's eyes and the break in Rose's voice...and the words unsaid.

Family of Blood; The part when the Doctor has to decide to leave a life that he could see himself being really happy in. He is so brave and it‚Äôs just another example of him sacrificing part of himself for others.

Last of the Time Lords; I find it really sad that the Doctor was so hoping he could help the Master see another way but couldn't.

The Doctor's Daughter; After finally accepting that there could be something within Jenny that was like himself, the Doctor losing her is just terrible. 

Forest of the Dead; The part when the guy Donna is married to in the 'dreamland' tries to call out to her but stutters and she walks away without hearing brings a tear to my eye. Also the part when River sacrifices herself rather than having her time with the Doctor ‚Äòerased.‚Äô

Stolen Earth; The part when Rose and the Doctor are running towards each other just makes me so happy I get a tear in my eye. Then the sudden panic at the thought he might regenerate before they can properly reunite. 

Journey's End; The part when Donna realises what will happen to her while the Doctor is holding her face in his hands and she begs him not to send her back it is just heartbreaking. Also, I think the end is bittersweet; although Rose gets 'the Doctor' he has to watch on as she appears to leave with another man. 

The Waters of Mars; When the Doctor realises he has gone too far and despite his efforts things go wrong anyway. He is so alone at this moment and knows his death is approaching. 

The End of Time; All the scenes when the Doctor and Wilfred are talking; down in the diner and up in the spaceship. I think for most of these two episodes I am at least glassy eyed. Also, when he wakes up after the Timelords have gone and is so amazed and happy to be alive only to hear the four knocks. His entire bitter and sad speech before he lets Wilfred out is heartbreaking. And of course, his 'I don't want to go.' The fact he wasn't ready and was so alone is just so sad.

Vincent and the Doctor; Tears of happiness and sadness. I just think it was a brilliant idea to let poor Vincent know that he is loved and remembered. 

A Christmas Carol; The part where the old Kazran turns around to see his younger self watching in fear at what he has become really got to me. Also, the fact that he had become so bitter because he was given the burden of choosing Abigail's last day.

Day of the Moon; Poor Rory. Always doubting that he is worthy of Amy's love. I was so happy in the end when he realised that he was 'stupid-face' I shed a tear.

As you said, Matt Smith himself has so far failed to really make me cry properly. But I am only up to episode 3 of the 6th season so it‚Äôs not too late for that to happen!

Either way, his stance does kind of rule him out, unless we're  really keen on him and want to rule out all other options in our pursuit of him. Which I think is a good thing - if we're going for the young, up and coming approach, Martinez is a better bet in my opinion. Swansea have been great this year but promoted teams have recently been experiencing a great first season and struggle to keep it up (not to take anything away from what they've achieved). Martinez however can take some credit for Swansea's position and has three seasons with Wigan on top of that.

I have heard from several people over the years that companies like payday loans, quickquid, and many others make most of their money back by selling the debt on to debt collectors, which is why they have no problem allowing people to have loans who they know can't afford to pay it back.

The way it was explained to me was that if you took out a ¬£100 loan, paid back ¬£70 and were late on your next payment, they charge you ¬£25 for late fee and a letter, all of which adds to your debt. They do this several more times, and when you can't afford it any more they simply sell on the debt to someone else and then it's not their problem any more.

With Xavi, Iniesta and Cesc controlling the midfield and Messi being Messi, all Drogba will have to do is wait for the passes to come to him, chest them down, turn and shoot. Considering his age, he may not have the strength to run up and down the pitch as much as he used to, and that somehow might even complement the Barca philosophy. With Drogba up top, Barca can continue playing their tiki-taka and simply punch the long-ball up to Drogba when the opposition defenses seem unpenetrable.

However, we've seen Drogba getting easily muscled off-the-ball these days. Granted that the PL is more physical than La Liga, will his failing strength still be enough for a two-year stint? That, IMO, is the multi-million pound (pun intended) question.

At least with the current system, you only pay back what you borrowed, Labour proposed to pool the loans and so you paid what was basically a tax, which would have been directly funding lazy / unsuccessful students. I think it's fair to pay back what you've spent.

RE giving wealthy students loans, tuition fees go straight to the uni, so they can only invest ¬£4k (¬£5k in London) of loan money. The chances are that these kids will pay their loans back so what's the problem. Also, not all children with ""wealthy"" parents will be given lots of money at uni, some will need it, unfortunately, it is just easier to give them a loan that they will likely pay off anyway.

Personally, I think that degrees should be funded according to their value to the economy as a whole and to plug gaps, but that's a hugely unpopular opinion with the lefties who want people to earn qualifications such as set design as a degree from the same institution as maths and science degrees.

I also think that primary school teaching should never be a degree, ditto nursing, it puts able people off, you don't need a degree to do either. I'm a fan of nursing colleges and let's be honest, if you can't teach year six maths without a degree then should you really be a teacher at all?

true,[deleted],null,null,"Steve Bruce had loads of money at Sunderland, and a good squad, a brilliant stadium thats always full, and played horrible anti football so would not be a good fit with our current system of play, and as you have seen he under performed as O'Niell has came in and they have moved up the league. Steve Bruce is also a former United captain so he would never be on the shortlist.

Martinez has a squad whose good players are kids (Moses and Di Santo) and a lot of championship at best players (there player of the seasons was Caldwell to outline that), his chairmen for all his determination and love for the club has no money, and he lost his best player in N'Zogbia at the start of the season. Even with all these stumbling blocks he never gave up on trying to play football properly, even when times where tough. Can you honestly say that Wigan would have stayed in the league under the likes of Bruce? 

Martinez is a talented young manager, and I for one think anyone who judges him on where Wigan finished does not understand football, as 16th, 16th and 15th is better than the expected relegated, and stuck in the championship for years that was predicted.

Everyone also forgets Swansea would probably not be where they are now if it wasn't for all of Martinez' leg work,  they were one of the mid table teams in the third tier, but he took over lost just one in his first 11, and took them to the play offs in his first half season, lost in the final, then took them up outright the next season, winning the Manager of the Year award. All doing this while losing his best players, just as he did at Wigan.

I know people don't want anyone as Dalglish shouldn't have been sacked, but having a go at a man for over performing against the odds is ridiculous.

You've got 7 or 8 main parts, and each will only connect to the correct cable/slot/socket:

Case 
Power Supply
Motherboard
Processor
Video Card
Hard drive
Optical (DVD) Drive
Memory

First time, expect to take an hour or so putting it together, but once you've got the hang of it it's easy.  I can probably go from a bunch of boxes to installing Windows in about 15 minutes now, and most of that is spent opening boxes.

Fix on a budget, and then visit /r/buildapc as others have suggested.  Don't cheap out on the power supply, it'll likely end up costing you further down the line.  If you are really nervous about putting it all together yourself see if you have any local PC shops (NOT PC world/Currys) who will either assemble your pile of boxes for you, or take a list of parts and give you a finished, working PC in exchange for money.  Expect to pay ¬£20-¬£50 for assembly.

I'm lucky enough to have a local PC shop who's prices are usually within ¬£5-¬£10 of online retailers, but I've used ebuyer.com, dabs.com, scan.co.uk and overclockers.co.uk with no problems.

Also, don't forget the cost of the OS if you are intending to run a legitimate copy of Windows.

EDIT:

I usually chose my purchases in this order:

1. Processor, do some research on best bang-for-buck etc, determine the type of socket required. /r/buildapc will almost certainly recommend an Intel one. 

2. Motherboard, MUST be same socket as the processor.  If I was buying a new one today I'd be looking for 4 memory slots, and SATA3 as a bare minimum.

3. Memory, check the motherboard memory type (DDR3 is most likely) and speeds.  Minimum of 4Gb, 8 or 16 if you can afford it.

4. Video card, mostly down to budget, and type of games you are going to be playing BF3 needs a better once than D3 for example.

5. Power supply, This [calculator](http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalculatorlite.jsp) will help you determine what size PSU you need based on the stuff above.  I usually go at least 50W above the recommended.

6. Harddrive(s), SSD drives, are fast but expensive, mechanical ones slower and cheaper.

The FT article by *Philip Stephens* (the one I was referring to and the first FT article quoted) actually calls for a cocktail of austerity and 'preprogrammed fiscal discipline', or precision  investment, 'radical redesign' of the European social model, and for the leading Euro states to field smaller surpluses to the benefit of the weaker states.  Hate to say it but that *is* the coalition's fiscal policy.  

Stephens notes that the OECD and the IMF applauded the UK position but in the face of what's happening now in Europe they're reviewing their position for Euro states petitioning weaker austerity, but recognises that the UK still in control of its own currency is staying hardline to the original IMF and OECD advice, even if it does question why when others are becoming more hesitant the UK's resolve grows.

That FT article is taken entirely out of context.

Admittedly the second FT article, the Martin Wolf article, is more anti-Conservative and relevant, but not convincingly so with discernment.  That article does indeed call for precision investment of around ¬£30 billion (around 2 per cent of GDP) with Wolf calling for far more.  Well:

...in the last month they announced ¬£70billion in advanced contracts over the next 5 years through Vince Cable and the Department of Business Innovation and Skills, another billion through the regional growth fund taking it to ¬£2.4billion, announced raising another ¬£18billion symbiosis with the private sector to capitalise a Green Investment Bank for green technologies and industries.  They're not *that far* from an accord!  The Wolf article specifically calls for an investment in housing - the government only announced its Green Paper on affordable housing at the end of February and remarkably it reads very well devolving open source power away from government to local planning authorities and councils.

The Wolf article in a break from what the submission argues is not that money can be printed ad infinitum but that a country with an independent central bank, a floating exchange rate and a financial surplus will not experience a run on its banks.  A bold statement since the very same country has *already* experienced a run on the banks and ended up bailing some out whilst it watched others crash.  Mr Wolf needs to take into account just how exposed the city is to the main German, French and Spanish banks caught holding Euro denominated Greek debt.

**2. Clint Hill -** Pulled off a few absolutely epic tackles to keep us in games we had to win. Not to mention bending the laws of physics with that late back-header against Spurs (I think...?)

**3. Djibril Cisse -** Yup, 3rd for me. A born goalscorer and a player the R's had been crying out for. Banged in goals that needed banging in, when he wasn't suspended of course. That record of scoring or being sent off in every game... It just could not have happened at any other club!

**4. Anton Ferdinand -** Nearly always looks solid and reliable, he does not mess around when the ball is in a dangerous area and deals with it - exactly what you want in a centreback.

**5. Samba Diakite -** A genuinely exciting prospect. Putting aside how much of a maniac he looked in his first appearance, he has looked a class act ever since. The thought of him pairing up with Faurlin next year has me drooling...

**6. Sean Derry -** Not always as commanding this season as he was the year before, but has certainly had his standout moments, not least of which is beating Theo Walcott in a sprint for a loose ball!

**7. Heidar Helguson -** Back in the dark ages of the first half of this season, there was one man who looked head-and shoulders above the rest of his team, and the opposition defense in the penalty area. The iceman himself.

**8. Paddy Kenny -** Looked a shadow of his former self in the first half of the season, but turned it around just in time, pulling off some crucial blinding saves since the beginning of the Hughes era.

**9. Adel Taarabt -** Took his sweet time reminding everyone what a talent he is, but again, did the business when it was really needed. Still does at least one thing in every game that blows my mind. Hoping he'll get off to a flyer next year.

**10. Luke Young** - Remember him? I would still have him at right back over Onouha in my R's lineup, and he went on a bit of a remarkable scoring run at one point before getting unlucky with injuries. I hope he returns next year.

If you go to the one that requires repayment in a week, and they have an APR of 6000%, you end up paying 8 pounds for each 100 you borrow.  You're not comparing like with like here.  In this case, the 6000% APR will cost you less.

I'm certain that people will find things that could be done better, and this is in no way close to the 'recommended' builds you'll find on r/buildapc.  This was me replacing my 4 year old Compaq as a student with a limited budget.  Anywho:

**Case:** [Coolermaster Elite 430](http://www.ebuyer.com/233740-coolermaster-elite-430-all-black-interior-mid-tower-case-with-side-window-rc-430-kwn1), ¬£38.49, ebuyer.com.  This case isn't massive, but fits everything I wanted perfectly, and looks nice while doing it.

**Motherboard:** [Gigabyte GA-M68MT-S2](http://www.ebuyer.com/340207-gigabyte-ga-m68mt-s2-fx-3-1-nvidia-geforce-7025-socket-am3-7-1-channel-hd-audio-matx-ga-m68mt-s2-fx-3-1), ¬£33.34, ebuyer.com.  This motherboard is small, it's got mini in it's name for a reason.  To be honest, I almost wish I'd got a larger motherboard, for more slot options and the ability to expand more.  Regardless, it works, has allowed me to overclock my processor fairly easily, and has managed to just about fit everything I want on it.

**Processor:** [AMD phenom II 965 black edition](http://www.ebuyer.com/186428-amd-phenom-ii-x4-965-black-edition-3-4ghz-socket-am3-6mb-l3-hdz965fbgmbox), ¬£94.99, ebuyer.com.  Although costly, I was able to slightly overclock it to 3.6Ghz with little additional temperature requirements.  It's been driving my PC fairly well, and is 64-bit compatible, a must have.

**Power supply:** [This one](http://www.ebuyer.com/190751-be-quiet-530w-pure-power-psu-bn106), ¬£44.95, ebuyer.com (see a theme about where this stuffs coming from?).  I've been warned by more experienced people that a good PSU is essential, so I spurged a bit on this, you could possibly look for advice on a more economical one.

**RAMS:** [Corsair vengeance 8GB DDR3 1600MHz](http://www.ebuyer.com/248846-corsair-vengeance-8gb-2x4gb-ddr3-1600mhz-cl9-1-5v-non-ecc-unbuffered-cmz8gx3m2a1600c9), ¬£38.76, ebuyer.com.  Could possibly have gone with a slightly cheaper brand, but I've heard mostly good things about Corsair.

**Graphics:**[Asus 1Gb Radeon HD6770 etc etc](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Asus-Radeon-HD6770-DirectCU-Graphics/dp/B005G7QNG2/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337345756&amp;sr=8-5), ¬£92.40, amazon.co.uk.  I'll be honest, I import bought this from PC world.  It works well, although it was somewhat of a struggle to fit it into the case.  Might be worth it to get a slightly cheaper card if you aren't OMG TEH GRAFFIX.

**Case cooling:**[FAN](http://www.ebuyer.com/176157-arctic-cooling-freezer-7-pro-rev-2-socket-775-1156-1155-1366-ac-frz-7pr2), ¬£14.97, ebuyer.com.  I got this, and 3 120mm case fans for around ¬£20 total.  It works nicely, I haven't had any temp problems even with overclocking and such.  Just make sure you get a good airflow (i.e. be careful where fans are positioned/pointing.

**Hard drive**: I'm a bad person, and I forgot about this, as I salvaged mine from my old PC, and use an external.  I also forgot about CD-drives, which I also salvaged.  So it may cost you around ¬£400 for a full PC, but I'm sure there are corners to be cut.  Ask people who actually know what they're talking about to get more advice, and don't think that this is the best build for the money.

I'm doing this from memory and utter contempt of ATOS so it may be incorrect in places, but I believe the current system works like this.

You fill in a DLA application form and send it along with whatever medical evidence you have to the DWP.

The DWP looks at the claim and decides if an interview with an ATOS 'professional' is required (new claims, changes in condition, medical evidence not supporting claims etc).  

ATOS sends someone round to ask if you can walk to the shops and back/make a cup of tea.  The doctor/nurse/ex-NHS cleaner from ATOS then writes a report which is sent to the DWP. 

The DWP then look at your claim form, the evidence you provide and the ATOS report, and deny you claim since the ATOS report states you are a faking cunt.

You then spend 18 months going through the appeal process whilst constantly worrying how you are going to put food on the table/pay your rent/clothe your kids.

true,thebuggalo,null,null,"When I posted the above comment, I kind of figured everyone would be on board with this idea, so I really didn't explain myself.  However now that there seem to be some naysayers towards the idea, I feel like I should point out the benefits that would come from this idea.

First of all, this isn't being proposed to be a permanent change, it's a one week thing.  I don't see why some people are so against the idea of introducing something different to this subreddit. The top ten posts on our front page are currently all images, the one with the most comments (41 at this moment) is on the post of a gif of a Matt Smith gay kiss, and most of those comments just talk about how much they love Matt Smith.  Is this really what we want this subreddit to be about? I feel like people are *scared* to discuss the show.  Perhaps they have nothing to contribute to the subreddit other than screenshots from the episodes we've all watched with text written on top of it. I know you all have opinions on the show, so lets here them. Which leads me to my second point...

I genuinely want to hear your opinions.  Yes Yes, I know you LOVE Matt Smith, and think he is so cute and dreamy, but I want to know why! Look beyond the written quirks of his characters and physical appearance and truly discuss what about his version of the Doctor makes it so wonderful. Lets talk about the ramifications of some of his actions that are never explored in the show.  We can work out some theories of plot holes to make some episodes make better sense.  And we can even help introduce new content to people who were unaware of it's existence, for instance, I just learned about the ""Night and the Doctor"" DVD special a week or two ago, but it contains some really great scenes. Using things like that to reference a discussion could help introduce new scenes to people who had missed them.

And that brings me to point number three.  Everything around here seems to be mostly focused on New Who. I, admittedly, am not as well-versed on my Classic Who as I'd like to be, so what better way to get introduced to it than through discussion which involves Classic Who.  I'd love to see a post where fans discuss their favorite Classic episodes, and form a list of ""Must-See"" episodes so newer fans could go back and watch the important scenes/episodes to get somewhat caught up without having to sit through 26 seasons of content.

Also, after 32 Seasons of a show, 6 of which are extremely recent, the best we can produce for entertainment and content in this subreddit are screenshots from the show, pictures of toys we bought online, and cakes? If we put our minds to it and discuss the show in interesting ways, who knows what could come from it.  We could all get bored after the first 3 days and the subreddit would be a ghost town for a week... but maybe it would be a very positive thing, maybe it would even garner some attention from other sources.  Maybe if we showed that we were not just a Meme-Producing group of rabid fanboys/girls, and are actually informed fans with a great passion for the show, we could get some AMAs from people involved in the show. Currently, if I were involved in making the show, I would seriously steer clear of the members of this subreddit.

I suppose I just wish people would actually give this a shot.  I really don't understand what you have to lose by trying it.  No photos of Matt Smith for a week? I guarantee you could look through the old posts on this subreddit and find pretty much anything that would have been posted.",0,1337350387,null,0,false,0,c4piphd,t3_trqvi,t1_c4piphd,t1_c4p6e4o,null,1428950809,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Yea but Roy had a mid-table team mentality. Watch his teams... all he plays is 4-4-2. If you read the quotes from Simon Davies in this article, you see that Hodgson was obsessed with staying defensively disciplined. Well that's all well and good when you're a team that isn't the favorite in virtually your matches. But when you're at a team like Liverpool, where the impetus is on them to score most of the time, those tactics aren't going to work.

Roberto Martinez is very tactically aware. Look at Wigan's squad. It's shit. It's complete shit. I would say it's the worst in the league player for player nearly every year (okay maybe Blackburn's was worse this year). And any good players they have, they are almost always sold after their good season (see: Valencia, Chimbonda, Palacios, etc.) Yet each season he has been able to keep them up through man management and tactics. The way he manages tactically, I can see him doing well at big clubs. He tries to play possession football and build from the back, even with a team with such limited players like Wigan. BUT, he also is able to recognize what formation works best with the players he has. Look at every other team in the bottom of the table. They all play direct long-ball football.

Also he has great man-management skills. Wigan lost something like 8 games in a row earlier in this season. 8 games. Yet, Martinez was able to motivate his players to not believe they were as bad as results showed, and they ended up staying up.

Why not AVB then? Because look at AVB's tenure at Chelsea. He tried to implement his playing philosophy (high defensive line, pressing, etc.) and he wasn't able to. Okay, sure, I think he should've been given more time by Abramovic, but the point is that he didn't adjust his tactics to facilitate the squad he had and use them to the best of their abilities.

Who are the other candidates? Brendan Rodgers? Sorry but I wouldn't risk giving a guy who has had a good season with a newly promoted team a shot with a big club like Liverpool. See how he does next season. There are so many newly-promoted sides that have done well like Swansea has their first season, and then get relegated the next (see Reading). Rafa? Well, yes I suppose he's a viable option, but at the same time, this squad is miles and miles different from the one he left, and I feel like for him to succeed he would need a team that he built.",0,1337351961,null,0,false,0,c4pizmc,t3_tt3rz,t1_c4pizmc,t3_tt3rz,null,1428950939,13,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,13

It goes back to pre-industrial times when people mostly lived in small villages which were organised along familial/clan lines rather than this concept of state and church sanctioned marriage - which was really just a way of wringing money out of the emerging middle classes, since if you weren't legally married then you couldnt pass property on to your children upon death.",0,1337352859,null,0,false,0,c4pj5qc,t3_trm9w,t1_c4pj5qc,t1_c4pgtsu,null,1428951021,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

It's why one of the few sections of fandom I get actively angry at are the ""bring back David Tennant"" crowd. Because, frankly, you only got David Tennant because nine previous versions of the show got cancelled. You knew your turn would come.

 I might have discovered it later in life, but the point is I found a show that makes me feel good and exemplifies the good about friendships and the strength of love. Because of that show I found the adventures of the doctor, he along with the ponies taught me many things that have made me a deeper thinking, more tolerant, well rounded individual. 

As for being called a manchild, well.. I think the newer doctors are perfect examples of men who never really lost the charm, innocence, and fun of childhood. I'm not even an adult yet, but I'm told constantly to ""grow up"" well I like that show I love the doctors and I never want to  conform to what others define as grown up.

On the other hand they may be wary of giving the job to someone who the fans will again side more with than them for sentimental reasons.


In addition to this, Rafa has a history of demanding lots of control off the pitch, especially regarding transfers, and it seems like the owners want this to be dealt with by other staff.

Also, I certainly don't think he is the man to rebuild our squad, which is what we need to be doing this summer and into next season. He barely speaks English after all of this time managing the English national team, and on a cosmopolitan team like Chelsea with enough language barriers as is, we don't need a manager who cannot communicate his ideas to the players.

He has a great relationship with Terry, Cole, and (to some extent) Lamps, so that would be a big positive. Also, he has a proven track record with big clubs such as Milan and Real Madrid.

My biggest issue is: think of the media circus that would ensue if we signed him.

Basically, the adult industry has been clamouring for an xxx domain for a long time.
&gt;Who decides what is classed as 'adult' material

The industry does, voluntarily. It's in their interests to not face this kind of overarching legislation, but rather have an easy to use ""turn me off"" switch for the worlds' prudes.

DNS filtering is indeed bad, but if a parent can enable a ""lock"" on an xxx domain then it resolves most of what these MPs want to implement.

Any determined kid can get around it by sharing IPs etc, but by the age that a child can do that, they're usually already discussing sexual taboos anyway and out of the remit of this policy and the goals it wishes to achieve.

The ""big reason"" is that they want to stop kids getting hit by pop-ups and other adult links that will easily lead them to more explicit material.
For instance, your hypothetical 10 year old daughter may just wish to do what million of others are doing and using a torrent search engine like ISOHUNT, but the resulting pop-up window will possibly expose her to explicit material she wouldn't normally see.

&gt;How do you enforce the law internationally?

Fining a site that transgresses a nation's rules is easy. You just report it. It's the same as enforcing drug sales and movie licensing in brick and mortar stores, and what some states do with gambling sites.  
""If you allow our citizens to buy/trade on your site we will pursue you according to laws in your own country"" which are usually very compliant when it comes to cross border trade.

Offshore Gambing sites now check incoming IPs and simply turn them down.

It's a fact that many of the owners of these sites hosted in more lenient societies like to spend their money in western states.

This particular Torchwood was founded in Cardiff to monitor a rift in space-time that manifests there. Things from other places and times slip through this rift on occasion. Torchwood deals with these incursions, and collects any alien or future technology involved in order to learn from it, and to keep it out of the wrong hands. They have a proto-TARDIS-like Rift Manipulator that they primarily use to try to keep the rift under control.

One of the most critically acclaimed animated shows ever made is Avatar: The Last Airbender, a show which was able to be deep, artistic, and funny all at the same time.

Other cartoons like Animainiacs were willing to make complicated songs listing all the nations of the world and recite (and mock) Shakespeare. They were willing to make political jokes and references to Buster Keaton and create complicated tongue-twisters of monologues. In effect, they were willing to go to *great* lengths to bring quality laughs.

I personally am put off by their use of Flash over traditional animation.

Doctor Who is willing to occasionally say ""the Doctor's not a good person"". Unlike MLP, who has it's characters make mistakes (and often act terribly out of character) and then be completely forgiven and improved to saccharine perfection.

Doctor Who is optimism in the face of death, darkness, and genuine greys. Where MLP is more about purity, Doctor Who is about having blood on your hands and still knowing there's good in the universe. Those are completely different angels to look at optimism.

Limitations?

Nothing personal, but that's no excuse *at all*.

Pixar's mantra is ""quality has no demographic"" and for good reason. Many, many shows, movies, and animated serial have been ""limited"" to a younger audience and are still able to tell deep and wholly interesting tales. Aladdin, Hercules, the Lion King, Toy Story. All ""children's"" films that managed to become major hits.

Saying ""Oh, it's going to be pretty underwhelming, it's *for kids*"" is a terrible excuse, because there are many, many, many shows that have shown that's simply not the case.

From Spongebob to WordGirl cartoons are able to be ""for kids"" and still be completely entertaining to an adult audience. Not in spite of it, but through it's medium.

Saying ""it's very good, for a kids show"" is to use the audience as some sort of handicap to excuse the faults of the show, which I simply can't agree with.

Yes, you can't directly speak on death or murder or dark themes, but if shows like Batman: The Animated Series or others like it have shown you can get the message across without being blatant about it.

AVB has a similar problem, as even though he is a good young exciting coach, there could be a backlash from the idiot fan (which unfortunately there is a lot of) who would berate him from the start for being a Chelsea reject.

All this on top of being in the Dalglish shadow and I can see it ending quickly in disaster.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"A lot of it is confusion.

I mean, shows like Firefly, Arrested Development, *et al* get cancelled, trying desperately to get a 18-29 audience while a show that's really not trying at all (and continues to categorically limit themselves to the simplistic and derivative) gets this overwhelmingly fanatical support from a group they couldn't care less about.

I mean, the show's nice and all, but it's nothing stand-out. The animation's the cheap Flash affair you can see in the likes of Johnny Test and the writing's... well, writing for A show designed to sell toys. It's a half-hour commercial, it's not meant to be real riveting entertainment, at least not for adults who've seen better.

And so there's bitterness. 

Not just in a ""why are you devoting yourself to that and not this"", but in reaction to how very, very, loud the brony community can be.

I can't pick a random server in TF2 without bumping into a brony server, and even then we'll get Rainbow Dash tags left right and center in other places.

It's just so very irritating, and it's difficult for people to wrap their minds around.

The show is just so artificial. The whole candyland ponies thing has been drained out as an old Eighties marketing ploy. Society's grown up, we realize how very shallow that whole affair was and we moved on.

But now Hasbro gets all this attention. Not for deep or even elaborately funny writing. Not for advanced and talented animation. 

It's a show that (like so many ""celebrities"" nowadays) is famous for being famous. And that's what bothers people.

Don't get me wrong, taste's a subjective thing and I actually hold no ill grudges against the brony community. In fact, (though I may not care for the show) I find the community to be some of the most kindhearted fellows I've ever encountered.

She attempted to get off with it by stating it was just one journalist.  Police went along with the story.  After much hooha and expose by the Guardian, it transpired Murdoch, and her, were paying bribes to the police for information, and that phone hacking was rife within her organisation to the extent she demanded hacking, or a resignation, from journalists.

She basically tried to save her own neck by denying all knowledge, thus dropping her former employees in the shit.  Luckily she has been exposed.  She continues to protest her innocence.  As does Murdoch (characterised here as Satan)

The chances are slim, perhaps slimmer than against Barcelona, but they are there. I think getting past the Catalans seems to have instilled some confidence into the squad and fans, and momentum goingo into a big game is often overlooked. This is why I don't think Chelsea will take the trophy: CFC was able to fend off a Barcelona that wins games with its midfield. When the opponent is playing a catenaccio strategy, midfield becomes pretty irrelevant. This, coupled with the fact that their forwards aren't the physical, go for goal type that can take long shots (Villa being the man to usually fill this role), really favored the Blues. Bayern don't rely on the midfield as much as a team like Barcelona does, and have strikers that are physical are able to take more risks. Looking at the Bayern defense, this is where things are more even. In Bayern last game against BvB, their defense looked terrible. I think it has more to do with the fact that it was Dortmund on the other side of the field (who has had Beyerns number for the past couple of years), but it still should be no excuse. Ramirez will be out, leaving the Blues with Drogba and Mata (and to an extent Torres) to be tho ones to challange Neuer and the defense. The goals against Barcelona came from Drogba on a counter, Ramirez(out) on another counter, and Torres on a one-on-one against Valdez in the final minute of the second leg when FCB had all but given up on defending.

The result is that teams tend to pay more attention to their players and keep them on long-term contracts spanning at least 3 years into the future.

But I have come to enjoy the taste, not just the image. I find beer to be like chugging empty calories, and most mixed drinks are the same, so scotch actually suits my lifestyle better

Basically, to get started I would highly recommend you go to a scotch tasting. Whisky is the Scottish variety (called 'Scotch' in North America predominantly) and Whiskey is the Irish. There is a distinct taste difference between most varieties of whisky/whiskey but initially you'll be deciding between Scotland and Ireland. This guy is 100% Scotch

So at your tasting you'll be exposed to a selection of different regions. Google a whisky map of Scotland to see the basic variations. Ice is rarely used but a few drops of water helps to 'activate' the whisky and get the full flavour. Once you decide on a region that fits your palate, try exploring different products. A single malt is my preference over a blend, but some blends can be delicious. Cardhu is a great beginner's whisky, I believe JW Black is 75% cardhu blend too, hence why I like it so much

I wouldn't go buy a bottle of anything before you've tried it, recommending a whisky to someone is as difficult as recommending a red wine",0,1337377423,null,0,false,0,c4po6ex,t3_ttnle,t1_c4po6ex,t1_c4pnrdo,null,1428953456,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

First, welcome to Bristol - hopefully you'll find it interesting. I spent a year myself in the states (Delaware) not so long back, and found it a great experience.

[Bristol Indymedia](http://bristol.indymedia.org/) also might have something interesting going on. I'm sure there's something out there you could lend a hand with.

Not too surprising, getting our squad to a champions league place could be the toughest job in the premiership next year. We finished poorly last season but with a large proportion of vocal fans annoyed at Dalglish sacking and or clamorous for Benitez things will be made that much tougher. We'e basically looking for a ballsy young manager with some European experience and premiership knowledge. A short list consisting only of AVB or somewhat with imperious experience across a huge range of leagues. Mourinho, Hiddink or Capello. Other managers such as Rodgers or Martinez are big gambles. They are most likely astute to the risks they could undertake in going for the jobs themselves. Managers now no they basically have to perform at any level of football
  Look at Steve this season or Megson a few years back at Bolton, mangers comes in wants results as gritty as possible while clubs sell their top players, fans vent fury at manager. A mans career is sped up over the course of weeks rather than months and the higher profile the club the faster the rate.

I will agree it seemed like a waste of Giancarlo but I feel that was only because he did such an excellent job in breaking bad anything else was bound to fall a little short.

As far as being out of place, it was. Someone in the community sub pointed out that the production code for this episode was 322 (Even IMDB had it as the finale yesterday. It's been changed now.), which meant it should have been the finale. That also explains why Troy and Abed were back in the study room at the end when they find the baby. Chronologically, they still should have been banned from Greendale.

As for being stretched out I don't really get what you mean. I thought as a stand alone the episode was great. I laughed almost the entire time. I will agree though that the finale blew me away. So much character development.

A. The article specifically states *we're* asking him to wait on making a decision until we find out if we're in the Champion's League. This makes me feel like we just want to know if we're getting some extra money before we offer him a contract.

B. THIS IS NOT OUR MARQUEE STRIKER SIGNING. Saha is out of contract in the summer, and seeing as he'll be 34 in August, I hope we don't resign him. Adebayor is back to Man City. Defoe wants to leave unless he's starting, and he's not good enough to start. Guess how many forwards that leaves us with? ZERO. That means we need to bring in two strikers if we can convince Defoe to stay, but probably 3. We are hopefully competing in multiple competitions next season, we need all the depth we can get as this season made us painfully aware of. This guy is free, and will be third choice.

C. He's in his late 20's, which is usually the best years for forwards. He's coming off a season where he scored 15 goals in 34 games. That's an average of .44 goals a game. Wanna know what Remy's was? .45 goals a game. And I would argue that La Liga is a higher quality league than  Ligue 1. I'm not by any means saying that he's better than Remy (although I really don't get the hype around him), but he's not bad. Especially for a third choice. And especially when he's free.

Think of it like this, where the majority of people in England know what Doctor Who is(Regardless if they watch it), the majority of people in the States have no clue. So you have more people randomly tuning in, and an intro that explains things can be the difference between that person watching the episode, and thinking,""Doctor Who?

Wonder down gloucester rd and cheltenham rd checking out cool bars and pubs, and in the daytime charity shops and all sorts of independent stores, much nicer than town for a bit of shopping. 

If you do head into the city centre, check out the water-front and st nicks market.

For days out that cost a little money, feature bristol zoo, @bristol (looks like it's for kids, actually awesome for anyone interested even a tiny bit in science), the aquarium.

I could go on and on! Bristol is buzzing with so much to do and if you get out there everyday you will have a blast! 

If you enjoy going out for a drink of an evening, going big or for more chilled evenings, try to go somewhere different every time you go out. The best way to take advantage of time in bristol is to say yes and sample the vast variety of opporrunities here.

Even with the success he had (success that I hold close to my heart), I remember the heavy criticism he received from LFC supporters about his rotation, his transfers, man-management, etc.

I think looking back we tend to forget things like that.

More recently, he was at Inter - another big club - and struggled there and since being sacked in December 2010 he hasn't (by choice or not) had a job.

We can argue that he didn't get time, support or money. Nevertheless, the results weren't allegedly there according to Inter and he was sacked.

Again, he'd probably be a fine choice but I don't understand the pleas for him to return to Liverpool. What happens when he falters? The cries of ""Same old, Rafa"" start to emerge.

The Doctor is the one that pushes the protagonists, the companions, into situations. That's his main point in the story, but at no point does that make him the protagonist.

&gt; *pro¬∑tag¬∑o¬∑nist*‚ÄÇ[proh-tag-uh-nist] 

&gt; **noun**

&gt; 1. The leading character, hero, or heroine of a drama or other literary work.

Look at that.

Look at it.

At no point does it say ""character who is well-written"" or ""character who has most changes"". It's the character who is the hero. The character who takes the actions that forge the story and is the character the story follows consistently.

That.

Is.

The.

Doctor.

But let's just ignore that and assume to follow your own bizarre definition saying that a character has to go through a beginning, middle, and end to be the protagonist, even though that makes absolutely no sense and any literary major would say is unnecessary to have the title.

The Doctor does indeed have a beginning and an end. It's called regeneration.

He;s not this constant thing. He's always changing, not just in face, not just in location, but in personality and mindset.

He learns, he adapts, he grows stronger. Pain he experiences in one episode stays with him. He actively changes into a different type of person over his tenure. 

Tennant began as ""rude and not ginger"" but ended as a completely different person. He had a beginning, middle, and end, and we saw him go through that over many adventures (and many different companions, sometimes with ***no*** companion).

Seriously, need I explain why the main character of ***DOCTOR*** Who is the Doctor?

Only someone with a terribly limited view of literature would claim such.

Many novels, films, etc. have ""protagonists"" who are terrible monsters. Look to American Psycho. Patrick Bateman is indisputably the protagonist, but the whole story is designed to show you how very inhumanly unrelatable he is.

The Doctor is the character we always follow.

He is the character we empathize with. 

I mean really, his ""I don't want to go"" scene is a major goodbye. That's the turning of a new page for our protagonist (and, may I add, it's a change he goes through alone).

He travels with friends, but these friends come and go while he marches on. And we follow him through that. He doesn't always push his companions. In fact there are many times he sends his companions home while he deals with the foes himself. They are his *companions*. His *assistants*. They follow *his* adventure.

&gt; A protagonist is the main character (the central or primary personal figure) of a literary, theatrical, cinematic, or musical narrative.

Right there we need definition of ""main character"".

The main character is the entity the story follows. Their actions are the ones that the story follows and are what forges the path of the story. Their actions propel the plot and often resolve it.

What you need to understand is that the companions can be best described as ""deuteragonists"". These are characters that act as secondaries to the protagonist.

I think the confusion is that these secondary characters who act solely as motive to the protagonist (frequently getting kidnapped, acting as emotional leverage for the protagonist) are also the audience surrogates.

In this world of fantasy and science the audience needs a character they can pretend is essentially themselves. They are the sounding board for other characters to explain the mechanics of this alien world.

They are reflections of us and are to act as the window through which we see the ""Whoniverse"", but they are merely the ""sidekicks"" to the Doctor.

There has never been an episode of Doctor Who in which the Doctor did not play a key role save for one: Turn Left.

In all that time the Doctor has been the one to face the Antagonists and develop the solution to the conflict.

I would imagine the fact that companions come and go would be *very* indicative of how little the show actually focuses on them.

Doctor Who can go on without Rose or Amy or Sarah Jane. But the story needs the Doctor or else it is simply not Doctor Who.

Like I said, RTD played with the idea as The Doctor being the actual protagonist of the show, and I'm sure several did before him. This does not mean that he is always the protagonist. It's a show that has lasted for almost 50 years, and has gone through many changes. The rule of thumb is that we're following the stories of the companions as they journey with The Doctor, but as I said, that doesn't mean writers haven't experimented with the overal story.

Good example, I don't watch House much, but I've seen a few episodes from time to time. The other day I caught an episode in which they focused on the Chief of Medicine instead of House, making her the protagonist of that particular story. That doesn't make her the protagonist of House.

It's a major multi-episode story that forged the vast majority of what the Time Lords were. There were other stories that would have entire episodes of the serial solely focused on the Doctor.

Several have played with the idea because that really is the show. The show has one character who we follow, who fights evil and foils plots and generally does everything to make the plot go.

The rule of thumb is that we follow the Doctor as he meets and picks up new companions along the way. Seriously, there is massive scope here that you seem to be overlooking. The companions come and go but the actual actions of the episode are made by the Doctor.

Picking an episode at random let's look at ""The God Complex"" from Series Six. The Doctor is the person who puzzles out the answers. We follow him as he gives orders to the group and attempts to keep everything together.

We see him try to get Amy to stop trusting in him. We see him deal with the death of his newly made friends. It is blatantly clear this is not Amy's story.

Another. 

Let's look at ""Idiot's Lantern"". The Doctor has to save Rose who has had her faced snatched. He befriends a boy and enlists his help in defeating the big bad ""Wire"" while teaching him to stand up for himself along the way. A lot of scenes here are of the Doctor himself.

Another.

Midnight, the Doctor is surrounded bvy strangers, is the person to command the situation through the majority of the episode and attempt to solve the puzzle of who the baddie is and at the end is the one battling in danger. He is the person we are rooting for, we side with, and we fear for.

Another.

Earthshock. Peter Davison. We see the Doctor in a multiple part episode lead a team of future explorers into escape from deadly Androids. He diffuses a bomb and sets out to solve the mystery of whose behind it all. He discovers it's the Cybermen and attempts to stop them from invading all of earth during a key intergalactic peace conference. He has to deal with the death of one of his companions who sacrificed himself to save them.

Need I really describe more? The vast majority of episodes. No, virtually every episode focuses on the Doctor to move the plot along. This isn't the exception, it's the rule.

He's not just the titular character, he's the one we're following. It's *his* story and I will list off every single story that's his from Hartnell on if need be because it's right there from black-and-white to HD.",0,1337400715,null,0,false,0,c4ps01p,t3_ttu8y,t1_c4ps01p,t1_c4prw17,null,1428955447,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I personally still miss Tennant to this day, but I have definitely had enough closure to accept that he's gone (for now), but will always be *my* Doctor.  It's very important to realize that the Doctor's personalities are definitely different every regeneration, but along the lines of emotion, the supporting characters do stay the same.  Both Rory and Amy show deep emotions while Matt is calm, curious, and confident most of the time.  He eventually does become emotional during a few episodes and he's just as good portraying that kind of role.  I broke to pieces during [spoiler](/s ""The Doctor's Wife"") and [spoiler](/s ""The Doctor, The Widow, and The Wardrobe"").  I believe it's because of his invincible personality being brought to reality that made me cry.  Either way, it's a brilliant strategy and it's a nice break from constant tears shed with my fearsome Doctor, Tennant.  On a separate note, I think Tennant is the most dangerous Doctor to date.  But that's what it takes to be a great Doctor, a bit of risk.

If you were to add in endless stipulations of things like consent and what constitutes consent, not harming others within reason and endless numbers of other points you are then left with an extreme libertarian position (which would have its own problems) which feels like a much differnt point then the facebook post was trying to argue.

That is the point of the protagonist.  The Doctor is not the protagonist, but the focal character.  While usually the same, these are distinct functions for characters to fill.

true,Sjreed,null,null,"Lets say we did do this, what would be the consequences?

My prediction would be investors would leave pretty quickly and the financial industry would have little choice but to relocate lowering the countries tax income, interest rates would shoot up and the middle class would start defaulting left right and centre on over leveraged mortgages. 

The growth of GDP would be a smaller % than the % of GDP borrowed to create it meaning our deficit continues to increase and after a few years we would start stagnating again and would not have made any progress in sustainably rebalancing the economy and be in an even worst debt crisis.

I don't really understand the left argument that making cuts lowers tax revenue, as public services are funded by tax money anyway, the same way that paying benefits does. So yes it lowers tax income, but the income is just a small portion of the borrowed money your spending to create it, not newly created tax revenues like you get from the private sector. It's a completely unsustainable way to generate tax revenue.    

If the deficit is being reduced by a higher percentage than the amount the economy is shrinking, it's better than getting growth if the percentage of growth is lower than the rise in deficit. I'm by no means a Tory but pragmatic fiscal policy is pretty important at the moment and Labour are living in a dream world with dangerous consequences. To have any credibility on how stopping the cuts and providing stimulus is an option they need to clarify how much they plan to spend, what level of growth it is expected to yield, how they expect this to impact interest rates and what the risks are if spending does not create growth. For example a VAT drop of 2.5% would cost around 12.5B a year and give how much growth? if it gives any less than 1.5-2% additional growth, then it is has a negative impact on our finances (not to mention the interest and damages on our borrowing rates).

Nope, that's the focal character. The focal character is mostly created to simply be the ""excitement"" of the story, though not necessarily the main character about whom the audience is emotionally concerned.  And the Doctor, while very exciting, is not typically a big emotional concern for the audience that they can empathize with as well.  (It happens occasionally, but definitely not in every episode, nor as the main arc of the story, excepting some RTD arcs like the specials.)

Unless you have undergone regeneration and can sympathize with that?  Or the loss of the rest of your species at your own hand to save the universe?  Done that lately?

Take, for example, *A Good Man Goes To War*.  Now, it is easy to sympathize with Rory trying to save his wife and child.  But is it easy to sympathize with the Doctor there?  Not really.  His major emotional pit during that entire time is *feeling sorry for his companions* due to his failure.  The rest of the time, he is there to make exciting things happen.

&gt; The other important aspect of the multiplier, is that to the extent that government spending generates new consumption, it also generates ""new"" tax revenues. For example, when money is spent in a shop, purchases taxes such as VAT are paid on the expenditure, and the shopkeeper earns a higher income, and thus pays more income taxes. Therefore, although the government spends $1, it is likely that it receives back a significant proportion of the $1 in due course, making the net expenditure much less than $1. Indeed, in theory, it is possible, if the initial expenditure is targeted well, that the government could receive back more than the initial $1 expended.

Obviously, the exact scale of the effect is up for debate, and nobody really believes that it's greater than (or even close to) 1 for all government spending, so it's not just a case of spending more on everything and thus saving the economy. But correctly targetted spending is definitely capable of causing a net improvement in the government balance sheet.

Managers that deserve every single bloody penny of the large salary they earn. They make good business decisions, they improve staff morale and create good work environments. The company is reaping the benefits from what they pay them. Pay them seven figures if you can afford it. I don't care.

Then managers that make shitty decisions those lower down know are wrong but have to implement. Managers that are hostile to staff and cause work environment to feel like prisons. 

There are more than the second than the first. So what if it took them a decade to get there?

The basket of goods contains crap like electronic goods that are infrequently purchased and always go down in price which hide the true rate. This is why many food items and energy have gone up loads yet inflation is apparently only 5% each year. If this is input into GDP in real terms it's misleading. GDP has a place but I treat it with scepticism at best.

The world bank GDP deflator looks nothing like the real picture of inflation in the UK:

http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.DEFL.KD.ZG

So 1.8trn in 10 years. That was fairly flat until 2001 then rocketed up as house prices went mental (data from google via world bank):

[Google UK GDP data from world bank](http://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:GBR&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=895532400000&amp;tend=1274223600000&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false&amp;q=uk+gdp)

2001 to 2007 was the key period. So 6 years increase of 1.4trn but not 6 years of 1.4trn more per year. That's not going to add up to that much. Add in the fact that inflation figures are just plain wrong when it comes to effecting the standard of living of the man on the street.

Also add in the fact that house prices are unsustainable and will drop more yet are currently counted by UK people as ""my pension"" and we have a lot further to fall from 2007 before we hit the real picture.

Labour's ""boom"" was debt driven. It fell off a cliff in 2007. Since then they and the Tories have been trying to fight reality by allowing QE, the inflationary effects of this are being felt but not recorded by economists. QE has to end and when it does borrowing costs in the UK will return to normal instead of the 2% mess Brown had us in. Then we will see how the UK fares in the real world.

How much money has been pumped into the economy as debt via house prices and absurd assumptions about growth via pensions that is in fact pulling demand forward that will have to be paid for now? The whole setup is about pulling demand forward through unsustainable assumptions.

edit: I would also add that the pound has also fallen loads against USD since 2007. Yes it may have been too strong but that gave the UK, which has a massive trade deficit, purchasing power. The erosion of GBP might be


edit:

here is a 9% boost for exactly the same houses for you:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7183551.stm

&gt; The value of the UK's private housing stock rose by an estimated 9% in 2007 to reach ¬£4 trillion, says the&gt; Halifax.
&gt;That figure has more than tripled over the last decade, rising by 208% from ¬£1.3 trillion recorded in 1997.

...

&gt;The Halifax calculates that booming house prices have meant overall household wealth has more than doubled in the last decade, rising from ¬£3.3 trillion in 1997 to ¬£6.7 trillion in 2007.

Start selling some of that for a profit (someone else has committed to pay for it over 25 years) and the seller has lots of lovely cash to spend in the economy. Hey business is great! This is easy - let's just increase house prices above wages *forever*. Thanks Gordon!


And finally the lovely BoE setup by Gordon:

&gt;Both the Halifax and Nationwide predict a further slowdown in 2008, and with further interest rate cuts likely.
&gt;
&gt;The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted unanimously to chop interest rates from 5.75% to 5.5% at its December meeting.

5.5% - lol. That would be the end of the UK in 2 weeks if they did that now. Yes we are much stronger as a nation after 15 years of Labour.

The economy did drop hideously in 2007. Whether you like the term ""fall of a cliff"" isn't really something to talk about. The Tories are determined to stop it recovering. Careful your ideology is showing when you bend over that far.

Yes from the private sector, who played a huge part in this. They messed everything up with loose credit. Brown let them do this because he is either mad or thick. Either way it suited him and kept Labour in power until we hit a wall.

Brown then rewarded the banking sector who helped his boom by bailing them all out, all so he didn't look like a fool. We and our children will live under that shadow.

Also measuring GDP increase (which as I say is fudged anyhow) in $ is not great. The USD has also devalued significantly since 2007 as they too seek to monetise their debt by printing money. Using GDP to prove your point is not robust. Labour's term was debt fuelled. As I said some companies who are creating genuine wealth came out of it but these are in the minority as the government policy skewed towards debt as wealth.

Borrowing costs are starting to go up. BoE are pushing on a string. SVR has detached from base rates for many lenders. Santander UK is 1/3 of mortgages since 2007. Once debt costs go up we will see the UK for what it really is - a debt fuelled mess all to be paid down off the back of asset price rises if/when they start issuing more debt.

Go back in time to 2007 or see that BBC article in my last post - ask them if we are rolling in it and all is good. You will get a resounding ""yes"" because they think debt is wealth.

true,too_long_didnt_read,uk,UK,"Now you've gone from a sure thing to ""better chance"". That's progress I guess. Allow me to help further.

America has increased their debt from $10.7 Trillion to $15.5 Trillion since 2008. That's $4.8 Trillion of extra debt, which is over ¬£3 Trillion pounds, which is 150% of British GDP. Think about that, Obama has borrowed and spent one and a half times the value of the ENTIRE BRITISH ECONOMY over 4 years.

America is bankrupt. Their credit has been downgraded and each citizens share of the debt is almost $50,000.

Obama could have given every person in America over $15,000 which would have had a greater impact on GDP.

What you fail to understand is that simply spending on the assumption that GDP will increase does NOT deal with this problem. Given how much Obama's spent America's GDP needs to be MUCH MUCH MUCH higher than it is to deal with the additional debt.

Your comments about Greece also completely fail to understand the different economies. Greece is a country where tax avoidance is rife. Over the years their dealings with the EU have meant that Greece has taken on debt it could NEVER pay back. The money was spent on massive public sector expansion and there was no corresponding increase in the private sector. When the EU's money ran out, so did the money to pay for their huge public sector. Greece needs to default. There is no other option for them.

&gt;Austerity is an utterly failed experiment, just like trickle down economics and deregulated banking. In fact every neo-liberal economic policy has failed miserably with the space of a few years of implementation.

Austerity is very simple, it's called ""living within your means"" and governments have been doing it for hundreds of years. This ""spend what you don't have to mortgage future assumed growth"" has lasted exactly 10 years before it collapsed like a house of cards.

true,benfitzg,null,null,"That is incorrect about the bailout and current accounts. The government could have protected all money up to a certain amount (or even all the current account holdings) and let the banks go bust. Brown let this happen - you are speculating that the Tories will let it  happen again. Brown did let all this happen and he shoulders the blame for much of it.

Using words like pathetic again is very disagreeable - why get personal? Of course if house prices increased loads and have yet to drop and yet are unsustainable then we can assume that this will manifest itself in the near future. To say this is invisible is odd. Same for pension deficits. Robbing tomorrow to pay for today - the UK all over nowadays.

Housing pumped trillions into the economy. Private and public debt increased by trillions. The pound fell in real terms. Inflation is not being applied correctly to the figures, artificially skewing them upwards.

Living costs remain astronomically  high. Again we are pulling demand forward as pension savings are totally inadequate but this won't manifest itself until far later. Should be fine - we can all sell our houses to our kids for 15 times wages, and retire for 30 years, right?

Again you are going for polemics. I'm saying you have to be careful in quoting GDP verbatim. It's too simplistic to say ""GDP went up by X over Y years"" and conclude that true productivity has risen by that amount.

The Tories haven't cut anywhere near what they need to in order to cut the deficit (the debt is a distant dream). They are continuing Labour's policy of borrowing from the future to hold the status quo, including house prices. They will fail, in fact they are already failing. Gravity will out and we will see Labour's term for what it was - a debt fuelled mess.

Of course anyone who doesn't think at all about the economy will see that the really hard times came when the Tories came in and solely blame them. Britain has been relying on living beyond it's means for many years and finally the chickens are coming home to roost.

Hopefully when the dust settles I'll be able to make more money being really good at my job than someone who has no knowledge of housing can make by going in loads of debt, sitting on it for a bit then selling it to someone else who gets into a lifetime of debt. ie a meritocracy where people doing real work that generates real wealth instead of leveraged debt",0,1337431770,null,0,false,0,c4puy4e,t3_tu4aa,t1_c4puy4e,t1_c4puv95,null,1428956857,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

The episode ""Dalek"" is a good example of how very alien the Doctor's issues are, but how very human are the ways in which he must deal with them.

They aren't expecting the audience to have fought Daleks or to even have suffered war, but there is no doubt that his loud speeches against the lone Dalek are meant to be empathised with. In this episode the Doctor really bore his soul and that does mean something.

You don't have to have fought in Viet Nam to empathize with Rambo's rampage. You aren't expected to have Starfleet training or be used to diplomacy with alien life, but there's no doubt that Star Trek expects you to empathize with it's main cast.

I haven't undergone regeneration, but I do know what it's like to totally change myself. I'm not the last of my kind, but I do know what it feels like to be alone.

No shit these companies don't always credit check, it's not like people with great/good/average credit are using these companies.  It's people that can't handle their money.

These companies are sustained by the same kind of people that go to Bright House etc.

The APR and charges are always clear from what I've seen and that bint suggesting their hiding the charges in the FAQ section is laughable.  FAQ is exactly where I'd go to look for charges, you know, it's a Frequently Asked Question.

With that said, perhaps we should be trying to help people that are slower than average not get trapped by these companies.  

At least with legal companies you can tell them to eat a whole bowl full of dicks if you don't actually have any money to pay, if you're in such a shit situation that you need to use these companies, going bankrupt or using insolvency companies isn't such a big deal.  Much better than getting beat up by illegal loan sharks.

 After reading about some pretty blatant PR attempts as part of a US Army advertisement campaign on Reddit, I expect to see a lot more underhanded and despicable posts doing things such as advertise products, decry institutions like the NHS and Royal Mail, sell the idea of joining the army, rubbishing things like green energy, and lots and lots of posts in favour of privitising this and that... because that will make things ""better"".

 If you don't know how to navigate an institution like the NHS, or use an institution like the Royal mail... it's not because they're shit, it's because your stupid.  If it's not a letter, stamp it/send it correctly.  

 No they don't get it right all the time, yes they fuck up.  Don't you?  Machines will be machines, and sorts are gonna get overwhelmingly curious every now and then.  There are very easy in-built ways to make sure that if you're sending cash, it will get to where it's going. 

 I'm not saying OP is full of shit, but I am saying I have never been disappointed by Royal Mail, and it's a shame that such a fantastic and historical institution can get SO MUCH bad press from fucking up once.

 Unless you get REALLY fucked over, don't whine about the NHS online.
 Unless you get REALLY fucked over, don't whine about Royal Mail online.

 Because the only other way of doing it, is to privatise - and if you;re the type to whinge, you'll have a lot more to whinge about after that.

I've said it before and I'll say it again.  Amy sees things differently than the Doctor and helps him to see things in a different light.  I think it's funny that Amy has a lot of the same characteristics of Donna but then people use those same things to criticize her.  Is it because she's prettier than the one you liked before?  I don't know.  I think she was a great companion, especially for Smith's Doctor. 

 Eleven has been an especially dour doctor and having her, and Rory have been good for him and to pretend that it would be believable for him to act the same without them is preposterous.  The show isn't about the ""missions"" they have to undertake in each episode.  It's not really about saving the planet or keeping history from changing.  It's about the Doctor.  We get to watch a 900 year old being handle the universes problems because he is a good man.  His companions compliment him personally.  It's not about who he can use as a tool to complete each job.  If he wanted someone to just do what he says he could get anyone.  What he needs is someone to keep him human and compassionate and loving when things go south.  People often forget that the Doctor is fallible and needs someone to keep him in check... a lot.  Yeah, she got herself into trouble, but so have every single other companion.  It's the other side of the coin when choosing a human companion.  It's one of the things the Doctor loves about humans.

true,syuk,ter-Sark,Sark,"It is an old school 'limited company' type of arrangement maybe? Lots of places I have worked who are UK ltd companies have huge disparity between managers and other staff in terms of salary. In these situations payroll is often a well kept secret, finance is controlled very tightly, it generates discord when people start to mull over why someone is getting paid more than they are.

There are often reasons in the background why people are getting paid more than others that have nothing to do with the actual work they do or the hours they put in.

If you are talking about smaller businesses then you might encounter a situation where 3 or 4 people out of say 12 leave the company, some of those remaining get 'promoted', to a newcomer the salaries are all over the place and seem disparate.

I wouldn't be happy to take a pay cut to distribute it like you say, and good managers who are responsible, dedicated and popular are what keeps a company going. 

Without good leadership there might not **be** a company, which is probably worse overall for the local economy and those inside it.

As for 'working from home' this isn't always the perk it seems. People might work from home in order to escape the noise of the office to get over a bump in the road that a project is suffering, working outside normal hours to achieve something, or they might have to be out and about meeting people and it makes more sense to remain at home base then come into the office and then go out again. Or, they might be in the pub each lunchtime and go back home for a lazy afternoon - their directors trust them to do the work, and if it isn't done then they are in the crap.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Okay, fair enough, let's have a look at this alternative then...

&gt;a wealth tax on the richest 10%

It's called Capital Gains Tax and they just increased it by over 50%

&gt;a Robin Hood tax on financial transactions

A Tobin Tax which would tarnish the jewel in the British economy's crown.  Any country in the world would love to have the world's number one financial centre.  The only difference is Britain actually has it.  The problem with the Tobin Tax is not only would it hamper the city in competition with the other global finance centres, it is also punitive of all transactions regardless of risk.

The alternative is a bank levy tax on bank borrowing, essentially taxing riskier practives actually promoting a reputation of stability.  They introduced the bank levy tax in January 2011 and have since gradually increased it over time so as to not shock the system.

&gt;a Land Value tax

I'm quite a fan of some watered form of Georgism, but they have just introduced a new upper level to stamp duty when buying a property.

&gt;the restoration of progressive income tax of 60% on incomes above ¬£100,000

When they reduced it tax revenue went up.  It makes sense that if they increase it again it will go back down.

&gt;and a clamp down on the tax evasion and avoidance that is costing us ¬£95 billion a year.

They announced that in the last budget.

&gt;Investing the resources released can halt the spiral of decline.

They have just opened the UK Space Agency, announced ¬£70 billion in government contracts open for UK bids, and launched a Green Investment Bank capitalising it with ¬£3billion with a view of securing a further ¬£15billion from the private sector to invest in new Green enterprise, technologies and projects.  They've given HS2, the building of a new high speed rail line through the spine of the country, the green light, another ¬£32 billion, and they've just built the finest Olympics the world is likely to ever see for a long time to come.  It's unfortunate that this blog post also comes on the back of news that a corporation like Vauxhall are identifying the UK as now prime for investment.

&gt;With unemployment rising month by month.

It just went down.

&gt;Instead of cutting and privatising our health

They've ring fenced the NHS budget, proposed capping the number of private patients they can serve at around 10% but allowing a hospital to receive 50% of its income from the private sector i.e. bleed from the profits of private insurers, creating another revenue stream.

&gt;Investing in alternative energy

Over half a billion in wind farm subsidy paid by the government currently goes overseas to foreign operators, and there's no way then can ever hope to bridge the pending energy deficit with 'alternative energy'.  What they have done is to identify several new sites suitable for a next generation of nuclear power, and there's no reason why it shouldn't be the UK that revolutionises the world by producing commercially viable Thorium reactors and next generation breeder reactors.

Having said that, once again, they have just launched a Green Investment Bank to invest in Green technology.

&gt;Establishing a national investment bank with the resources levied from the banks so that there is no shortage of funds to lend for manufacturing growth and research and development.

Deja vu.

&gt;To gain this level of support means the Radical Alternative must be seen to be fair. 

Not only is it not radical, it's not all that alternative!",0,1337442967,null,0,1337547056,0,c4pwc7s,t3_ttpxw,t1_c4pwc7s,t3_ttpxw,null,1428957485,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Gay marriage and decapitation are about as related as Obama and Hitler, which is to say, only in the minds of crazy Republicans (not saying that all Republicans are crazy, just that there is a subset of crazy ones.)

If a gay couple gets married, do the straight married couples who oppose gay marriage feel a disturbance in the force? Do their wedding rings start to burn? Does their queen bed split itself into two twins? No. A gay marriage does not affect other people. Decapitation does, and that's why you can't be free to do it to whomever you want. This, and the percentage of the population who are in favor of gay marriage are the two fundamental differences. Only a very few people are in favor of door-to-door salespeople decapitation, or free decapitation in general. A significant portion of the population is in favor of gay marriage.

Moreover, I'm not necessarily opposed to bowing to the will of the majority, but when the basis is a religious idea, it has no place in what is supposed to be a secular government. If 60% of the population opposes gay marriage, then that might be a valid argument for not legalizing (though just because there is a majority does mean that it has the right to oppress the civil rights of the minority), even if all 60% oppose it for religious reasons.

&gt; A big part of that failure lies with the egoistic players they had.

It's not 100% their fault - by all accounts his man management was awful and somewhat childish. I get that he was transforming Chelsea, but antagonizing them doesn't help that happen. Also, the fact that he moved the reserves away from the first-team is a bit concerning, and youth prospects like McEachran and Bertrand got even less opportunity under him than Ancelotti. 

And does transitioning a playing style mean never ever playing anything other than that style? Surely not. Yes, he was meant to bring sexy football to Chelsea, but *the players he had weren't right for it* - he went for instant change rather than a gradual evolution.

Maybe he was given an impossible job at Chelsea, and if he'd had longer in the transfer window (they brought him in fairly late) things would have gone better. But I don't think our current squad suits his style, he won't have massive funds to get the players he wants for his style, and then what?

true,too_long_didnt_read,uk,UK,"&gt;What point are you trying to prove here except for trying to say 'oh look, big scary number!!'. Their deficit is going down and they have steady growth, which means the extra money they have spent is paying off. They will comfortably slide back into a surplus now, without having to do much work at all.

Are you retarded? From 2008 America's GDP has increased by $800 million. To get that Obama has borrowed and spent $4.8 Trillion.

Their GDP is not even close to being high enough to service this. It was an EXTRAORDINARY cost for far far too little gain. America's growth has to rival China's for this to be serviceable, which is not possible. America are in trouble financially, which is why the markets have downgraded them to AAB.

&gt;You and the Tories are fond of these false dilemmas. You're witnessing where your 'only option' is leading us right now: further down the drain.

If you think Greece has any other option than default then you REALLY have no idea what you're talking about. They were downgraded along with ALL of their banks just last week to CCC. Do some research into Iceland to learn why you're wrong.

&gt;Oh look, the personal finance analogy again. Jesus fuck you Tories are fucking retarded. I swear all you are able to do is parrot bullshit rhetoric that Cameron shits out every Wednesday.

""Living within your means"" is not a personal finance analogy you moron, and your continued comments about the Tories despite them having nothing to do with this thread shows you are coming from a partisan point of view.

&gt;No, they have not.

Stop being stupid. It wasn't until the late 90's that Glass Stegall was repealed which marked the start of the easy capital and individuals.

Overall you sound quite young and you're continued attempts to make this party political rather than the economic discussion it is show that you're not too clued up on the topic.

&gt; America's growth has to rival China's for this to be serviceable, which is not possible. 

I don't think you understand what serviceable means at this point.

&gt; America are in trouble financially, which is why the markets have downgraded them to AAB.

The markets did nothing. A few biased ratings agencies downgraded them, and they have been proved wrong by America's recovery. Expect them to reverse it within a year or two. The ratings have not hampered America's ability to raise capital at all tbh, so it was just an empty gesture on their part. Feel free to point me to any tangible effect the downgrade had.

I was on a train a while back and the carriage I was in had quite a lot of South American exchange students (couldn't work out exactly where from, Brazil perhaps). They were perfectly polite and chatting to each other in a mixture of English and either Spanish or Portuguese. A woman on the train got *really* angry about this and started shouting ""why don't you go back to your own country?"" at these boys who were 13-15 year olds on an exchange trip. They mostly ignored her, but she wouldn't drop it. She got louder and more wound up, then started threatening the boys, then got her phone and claimed to be phoning some ""mates"" in Hastings who would ""sort them out"" when they got off the train.

Eventually the guard came through and other passengers were muttering about calling the police. Thankfully my stop came up and I got the hell out of there.

She's grown from being a bratty kid (essentially stuck at the mental age where the Doctor first walked out on her) to a bit of a mother-figure (which is fitting considering the overall childlike qualities of 11's character). Throughout all of this, she remains stubborn, hot-tempered, occasionally short-sighted, and completely in ownership of her own sexuality. I think she's a fantastic character.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"Self-builds can be cheap, but it's important to do the research first and to have reasonable expectations.

My current PC is self-built. It was first built a little over a year ago. Fairly budgety - my main requirement was that it be quiet.

Well, an Athlon 2 645 X4 has TDP 95watts, but the stock cooler still isn't that quiet, and cheap cases can rattle a lot, and when a power supply claims to be quiet, that's sometimes only relative to a helicopter taking off. A new power supply, a new cooler, *two* new cases and a fan controller later, and I'm a lot happier. Though there's some issues with hard drive noise, and the new cooler may be quiet but it turned out not to be PWM (really - even stock coolers are PWM, but some replacements turn out not to be) meaning the fan has to run fast enough to be safe with a full load, even when the system is idle.

I also assumed motherboard graphics would be enough at first, but due to driver issues on Linux had to get a cheap passively-cooled card. As part of managing hard drive noise, I use a caddy allowing the second drive to easily be removed. The original Samsung DVD burner simply didn't work - it would read, but never successfully burned a single disk - but returning it wasn't worth the hassle so I just replaced it with an LG one.

Add on a few other bits, and my cheap self-build has already cost me three or four, times what I originally budgeted. And I'm still tempted to spend on another cooler (with PWM) and an SSD.

Which is all really due to (1) not doing the research or being sufficiently skeptical about marketing claims, (2) not really being fully aware of just how much noise reduction I really wanted, and (3) buying relatively easily available items at first, even though I really know I'm just postponing the hassle a little.

With a pre-built PC, a lot of that is likely to be avoided. Obviously it's even less likely to be instantly perfect for you, but there's some mental barriers to overcome - e.g. warantee conditions - before you start upgrading it.

true,DirtyBristow,northumberland,Newcastle,"&gt; High percentage of people on benefits are generally loud and obnoxious people that dont care about anything anymore

I'd strongly disagree with that. In my experience only a small number of people who are on benefits have the type of attitude you've described, however this media obsession with ""scroungers"" (thanks Jeremy Kyle, you beady eyed twat) has resulted in this hideous stereotype becoming common place. That's transformed it into a vote winner, so now every party is obsessed with showing how tough they can be on benefit claimants. Just look at this government's treatment of the disabled and the DLA. Hideous doesn't even beginning describe it.

The Welfare State is one of the greatest things this country has ever created and by and large it's fit for purpose. Granted, areas such as the Job Centre (I can't think of a less fitting name) need to be reformed.

This is because they are automatically paid off **on the day you get paid.**

I know this because I used them a few times a couple of years ago.

If you get hit with **LOTS OF FEES - YOU LIED** when you applied, about how much, and when the money will be available.

The normal charge was about ¬£25 per ¬£100 I borrowed. Which was less than the ¬£35 bank charge.

The money goes out on pay day, and I saved myself ¬£10 - at least! I'd get charged ¬£35 for EVERY bank transaction that was over. So I saved ¬£45 if I covered two bank transactions!

If you come up short... you lied, and you deserve what's coming to you. (MUCH higher charges than the banks!)

true,pineapplol,english,,"&gt;In the most junior hospital trainee post (Foundation Year 1) the basic starting salary is ¬£22,412. This increases in Foundation Year 2 to ¬£27,798. For a doctor in specialist training the basic starting salary is ¬£29,705. If the doctor is contracted to work more than 40 hours and/or to work outside 7am-7pm Monday to Friday, they will receive an additional supplement which will normally be between 20% and 50% of basic salary. This supplement is based on the extra hours worked above a 40 hour standard working week and the intensity of the work.

I hear this line trotted out time and time again yet no one, including the government who are fucking over those on DLA, have provided any evidence to suggest it's true. A lot of their irritation seems to stem from the fact 70% of people are on ""DLA for life"", which isn't really that shocking when you consider most disabilities that would require someone apply for DLA don't magically get better or tend to degenerate with time.

I can't remember which Conservative politician made a big deal out of ""three generations of welfare unemployed people"", but they shut up fairly quickly after it was shown they were making up numbers and the real number of people in this situation proved completely insignificant.

In the meantime, anecdotal experience is pretty useless when talking about national statistical issues. 

Also, I'm taking the liberty of assuming when you say 5-6 generations you mean 3 generations instead, as the numbers behind 3 generations were shown to exist, though statistically insignificant. That's really doing you a favour, as even assuming 4 generations demonstrates a laughable ignorance of the actual situation. 5-6 is either ridiculous hyperbole or genuine malice, as it's simply too removed from the facts to be simple ignorance.",0,1337456849,null,0,1337468426,0,c4pykef,t3_tusxd,t1_c4pykef,t1_c4pyg99,null,1428958541,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

Luke, Han, and Leia all face foes and conquer their fears, R2-D2 and C-3PO never do these things. They *aid* the characters (R2 in the X-Wing is a great example), but they aren't the ones initiating the plot.

At that time we had put all of our poor into workhouses, forcing them into slave labour. Hitler decided that Jews should be put with all the poor and crippled too, as he considered them to be another cause of Germany's economic problems.

I live in the Northwest and got a contract in central London after having a few months off, I have about eighteen hundred quid in my bank account at the time and all was good.

Six weeks down the line without pay and I'm on the bones of my arse, I need to pay for hotels, dry cleaning and train fare up and down the country, I need credit on my phone and I need to eat. Calling in sick because I can't afford to get to work is not an option. So I called the bank and asked for my overdraft back, they reject me because I apparently had a CCJ over a ¬£100 parking fine from five years ago. I never knew because I'd never applied for credit, and not having any form of credit means you've got a shit credit rating anyway.

So I got a ¬£350 payday loan for a month, it took a couple of hours to get the money into my bank. I paid back about ¬£440 a month later and went about my day. So I got a 5000% APR loan and not only survived to tell the tale, but I was a happy customer. 

To be fair they took a huge risk lending money to me with no real background checks, and their extortionate rate covered that risk. That risk is caused by other people defaulting.

true,hhmmmm,null,null,"Actually while the majority of their income comes from the the bad with their money type and just roll over payments and shouldnt be using them this isnt where all their money comes from.

They actually provide a useful service for a lot of people from all walks of life who find themselves in certain circumstances and certainly one that ends up being cheaper than an unauthorised overdraft.

There is lots that can be done to make them better, making charges clearer and particularly stuff like stopping balances being able to be rolled over after so many months and introducing a phased reduction (say you can only pay only the fees and roll over a balance getting the same money out again for 4 months after which you have to pay back a certain percentage and cannot borrow quite as much). Although interestingly studies seem to show interest rate capping doesnt help much.

However as you  but getting rid of them will not help. These people will go somewhere and they will go back to loan sharks and so on.

There is a great Palent Money (NPR) podcast on payday loans, and they interviewed a woman who worked at one shop and over 6 or 8 years she worked there a guy came in every weekday at the same time rolled over the loan (ie paid it off and took another one straight out). She worked out he spent over $10k over 6 or 8 years and even telling him he didnt need to do this it was costing him money didnt stop the guy.

If everyone over the height of 5""10' was allowed to have orgies in the park, there would be outrage by shorter people. Saying that gay people can't marry is like the laws against interracial marriage, which were seen as morally wrong decades ago.

The law of not having orgies is indeed cultural - not religious. I'd say almost everyone would agree that having orgies in parks would be a bad idea in the long run, however introducing a religious law that discriminates against one group of people and isn't in accordance with the beliefs of a whole load of other groups of people makes no logical sense whatsoever.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Well let's actually go through Series One.

""Rose"", clearly focused primarily on Rose. This is to help introduce us to the world through an outside perspective, much like Sally Sparrow's role in ""Blink"".

""End of the World"". One could argue that this is Rose's story, although it's really shared. We see Rose having difficulty accepting all this alien universe and we see the Doctor working to solve the mystery on Platform One and gain a relationship with Jabe.

""The Unquiet Dead"". Again, the Doctor works towards a solution to the issue and resolving the conflict while Rose makes slight asides to the locals.

""Aliens in London"". We follow the Doctor more than Rose. He's the one who uncovers the ""alien"" and incites ""Protocol Nine"" and gets them to Downing Street. He's the one solving the  actual mystery and Rose's role is more diminished than episodes prior.

""World War Three"". The Doctor directs a solution and defeats the Slitheen. He has the most dialogue and faces the most difficult decisions (that in turn effect the path of the story. Rose now is more leverage for the Doctor than a character. She really is something for him to protect and look after under JAckie's request than the actual protagonist.

""Dalek"", we've discussed this one. Clearly focused on the Doctor.

""The Long Game"". Rose *just* tags along with the Doctor. It is now the Doctor who interacts with the locals with Rose at his side. (This seems mostly to be due to attempting to juggle and resolve Adam's subplot).

""Father's Day"". Without a doubt this is Rose's story. Her actions forge the story and the Doctor acts more like a protector and guide through this episode.

""The Empty Child"". The Doctor and Rose split up, but the Doctor is really the only person facing the antagonist. Rose's role in this episode is really just to get things ready for the Doctor's return and introduce Jack. The Doctor is the one who investigates about ""Jamie"" and questions Nancy and meets Dr. Constantine. I do admit that Rose's role is notable, but not *quite* the major focus of the story.

""The Doctor Dances"". The Doctor gets the truth out of Jack, deduces the true nature of Nancy's relationship with Jamie and finds a way how ""everybody lives"". Rose's role is quite diminished save for acting as a psuedo love interest for the Doctor, what with all that dancing.

""Boom Town"". Although there is a subplot with Mickey and Rose, the primary focus is on the Doctor and Blom and exploring the darker side of the Doctor and how much he knows about killing.

""Bad Wolf"". Rose is someone the Doctor must save. Her role is diminished to a thing to be rescued both before and after her ""death"". The Doctor is the one who (once again) works to solve the mystery and pushes forward the plot.

""Parting of the Ways"". Rose's role is significantly increased. The story is effectively split amidst the Doctor's difficult decision to kill humanity and the Daleks, Jack attempting to hold them off, and Rose's attempts to save the Doctor.

Quite a few of those episodes either have the Doctor blatantly as the protagonist or have Rose as a side/assisting role.

true,Sleww,lfc68,,"I'm not sure. Suarez is in the biggest danger of leaving after Kenny because of how much Kenny supported him throughout everything. I don't think he wants to leave but if Madrid, Munich, or Milan come calling, I can see him making an exit. 

The other two players who will be the most upset will be Stevie and Carroll. At this point in his career, it's pretty safe to say that Stevie will be retiring at Liverpool. Because of the injury problems he's had in the past few seasons, not many teams will be willing to put up a transfer offer large enough for LFC to sell the modern symbol of their club. 

As for Andy, anything can happen. Kenny was supportive of Carroll at times and unsupportive of him at others. He continuously played Andy to get minutes when a large majority of the fan base seemed to have given up on him. But then he didn't start Andy in the FA Cup Final when everyone and their grandmothers could see he was the player with the best form going into that match. I think Andy's transfer or non-transfer will come down to his performance at Euro 2012. If he plays well, a team like Tottenham may come calling. As an Englishman, he probably won't play outside of England so we can be pretty sure that offers from other countries will be disregarded.

There's a chance that Kuyt and Maxi may now choose to play at Liverpool. Depending on who the new manager is, they may think it will be worth it to see if they can get playing time before the January transfer window. It's also likely that Carra won't retire right now and wait it out a couple more years. Emotionally, he may be sad that Kenny is no longer the gaffer, but in terms of football, he knows that he'll probably get more playing time now.",0,1337474208,null,0,false,0,c4q1e46,t3_tvd6j,t1_c4q1e46,t3_tvd6j,null,1428959935,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

I said ""Anti-monarchists are nearly always bitter people who haven't achieved what they want to in life or have a chip on their shoulder so they blame inequality.""

To which you replied 

&gt;What a stupid and ignorant thing to say. Republicanism is a legitimate form of national government used around the world.

Didn't bash the belief system. Bashed the believers. Specifically those within Britain who hate the British monarchy. Not those who are against the hypothetical concept of monarchy. There is a difference.

&gt;I see you are instituting retrospective conditions to the debate, Violent or non-violent was irrelevant to the argument.

I don't think I could name a first world country that gave up a monarchy through peaceful means. That makes me believe it is unlikely to happen in a country which is largely supportive of the monarchy.

&gt;Can you actually structure a sentence without insulting someone, or is this just your way of making friends and influencing people?

Yes I can, not trying to make friends with strangers off the internet though so try not to get offended.

&gt;Facetious? Far from it, as a republican I prefer not to use, in my view, such a supercilious, antiquated title as king or queen.

Well that is plainly ridiculous. Just because you disagree with something doesn't mean you can't recognise it. I don't people that the Pope is really spoken to by God but I don't just refer to him as Josef Ratzinger. It is silly and makes you look stupid, its not like refusing to recognise a title makes your argument anymore valid.

Do the scandinavian monarchs get to appoint heads of churches, heads of the Crown Estate, parliamentary peers? Do their speechs get special national broadcasts that must have influence over much of the population? (Didn't she just help ease in internet censorship for example?) Didn't police arrest anti-monarchists for thought crimes prior to any sort of protest during the royal wedding? Hasn't Charles got into trouble for his quiet words to parliament?

&gt; Take the Queen away and introduce an elected president and not a fucking thing would change, you are so naive it is embarrassing.

No, social organisation isn't limited to one elected with all power, or one born with all power. There are many models. If you look to [US presidential genealogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogical_relationships_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States) it is very incestuous, with three father/son legacies, many 3rd and 4th cousins, and a surprising 22 presidents descendent of a British monarch (Edward III and I). They really like to keep things in the extended family.

&gt; We would just lose a valuable institution that has helped to define our country's history

Yes, monarchs like to agitate for war and brutalise lower classes. Ours tried Nazi appeasement and got over a stammer. Awesome.

That video was just to highlight the overwhelming correlation between inequality and social pathologies. As a convenience you made me look closer and I noticed that the commonwealth countries perform quite terribly. The monarch (including the wider monarchy) is a source of inequality in many forms: wealth, legal privilege, income, land ownership, judicial, militarily, and political. Therefore if we want to tackle inequality it would have to include the monarch (and the wider monarchy).

Just out of interest are you ex-military? Also if we look to the genealogy of the Prime Minister, again [it is quite tight-knit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogical_relationships_of_Prime_Ministers_of_the_United_Kingdom).

true,ColonelFlashman,wales-carmrthenshire,West is Best,"&gt;Do the scandinavian monarchs get to appoint heads of churches, heads of the Crown Estate, parliamentary peers?

No. 1. She doesn't take any active interest in the real running of the church. 2. The Crown Estate is the name of the property portfolio owned by the crown so yeah I assume other countries royals are allowed to choose who manages their property for them. 3. The House of Lords is stupid. I agree. But the fault there lies in the House of Lords, not with the office of Queen.

&gt;Do their speechs get special national broadcasts that must have influence over much of the population? (Didn't she just help ease in internet censorship for example?)

Yes. They do and they open parliament and make speeches in the same way as our Queen does.

&gt;Didn't police arrest anti-monarchists for thought crimes prior to any sort of protest during the royal wedding?

Yes. For conspiracy to cause breach of the peace or something. Not for treason. You can legitimately stage a legal protest in this country against the monarchy but you aren't allowed to cause a breach of the peace.

&gt;No, social organisation isn't limited to one elected with all power, or one born with all power. There are many models. If you look to US presidential genealogy it is very incestuous, with three father/son legacies, many 3rd and 4th cousins, and a surprising 22 presidents descendent of a British monarch (Edward III and I). They really like to keep things in the extended family.

This is the sort of thing that David Icke comes out with. If you look at France, which has an elected president they have many issues that we have.

&gt;Yes, monarchs like to agitate for war and brutalise lower classes. Ours tried Nazi appeasement and got over a stammer.

Historically maybe. Now? Don't be stupid. 

&gt;As a convenience you made me look closer and I noticed that the commonwealth countries perform quite terribly.

They are also some of the most gay friendly nations in the world with laws protecting from discrimination against gays. Does that mean that economic inequality also leads to acceptance of homosexuality? No. Because America does not have these laws whereas the Scandinavian countries do. There are bigger aspects of culture other than economic inequality that affect social problems.

&gt;Therefore if we want to tackle inequality it would have to include the monarch (and the wider monarchy).

Concentrate on the bankers before you concentrate on the royals I think. 

&gt;Just out of interest are you ex-military?
 
Nope

&gt;Also if we look to the genealogy of the Prime Minister, again it is quite tight-knit. David Cameron is a descendant of King William IV. Tony Blair is a descendant, through James V of Scotland, of King Henry VII

So? That is to do with the upper classes having a monopoly on power. Nothing to do with the office of King or Queen.

The antagonist only has to create conflict that the protagonist deals with - and the companions are often placed into difficult situations by antagonists.

Utter fucking bullshit! You've obviously never applied for DLA.

I get the higher rate mobility component.  I can walk maybe 20yds at a time, have acute angina, coronary thrombosis, heart disease, acute claudication, acute coronary atheroma.



I was initially refused, it took me 3 appeals and then a hearing in front of a tribunal panel before I was finally approved.  It took the tribunal no more than 5 minutes to decide in my favour - they said it should never have got that far at all and I should have been approved on first application.

For the 18 months I was appealing/waiting for my tribunal I was effectively housebound, only leaving the house once a week when my 70yr old father took me shopping in his car.

DLA is actually pretty hard to get.

In 2009/10 the rates of rejection for DLA were over 50%

And even then Moffat will write with the companions quite clearly *not* acting as protagonist. A Christmas Carol is quite blatantly about the Doctor, with Amy having an incredibly small role.

The companions (vastly more often than not) are simple leverage to effect the Doctor. Look at the Hungry Earth and Amy's role in it. She solely served to provide motivation for the Doctor. Victory of the Daleks is another story that's clearly a Doctor story that Amy happens to take part in.

The companions often are put in danger to give Doctor motive for his actions. From The Idiot's Lantern to A Good Man Goes to War the companion gets in danger, kidnapped, etc. and the Doctor (and company) rally to save her. That's not atypical, that's the default.

The companion must deal with the conflict caused by the antagonist, but rarely do they participate it. Rarely do they ever lock horns with evil and actually combat it.

Trying to claim that 7billion is down to the royal family is hard to prove, and even if it was the case do you think people would suddenly stop coming to the UK? Obviously not, the buildings, infrastructure and history will all still be there. Toursim is also mostly requires unskilled labour, and generally exacerbates inequality with the most wealth probably going to hoteliers and other big-owners. Incidentally inbound toursim was [17,900,000,000 ¬£ in 2011](http://www.visitbritain.org/insightsandstatistics/visitoreconomyfacts/index.aspx) so your 7 billion is inaccurate, and probably means royal influence seen as they only generate perhaps 200 million a year is woefully insignificant.

I think I have made my point.

You have failed to include 'losses' such as the Duchy of Cornwall's perhaps 10-25% voluntary income tax contribution on ~15million, or the opportunity cost of his 3/5ths of Cornwall being under used. The same goes for the land 'owned' by 'the queen'. The income the extended royal family sucks in is going to be much, much larger than the 40 million. It's a complex issue, the 'charity' money Charles Windsor has power over for example is 100 million and that is money only going to get spent in manner aligning with his personal politics. Of course there is inheritance tax, or not if you are royal enough. If you want to see the corrupting influence monarchy has on democracy, go have a look how many Prime Ministers are related to William IV or Henry VII.

Don't you think even if the figures you suggest are correct, 150 million is a steal when it comes to avoiding the rules that apply to subjects? 40 million over a life time is quite some money, and over her 60 glorious years that would be somewhere around 2,400,000,000.

Bitter much? I am guessing you probably have a chip on your shoulder with regards to most people that are better than you at things, richer than you or cleverer than you?

&gt;Money is not the most important thing in the entire universe,
&gt; the notion of spending 60 million quid on a fucking boat to celebrate some old bat's commerative crown waving ceremony is a disgusting waste of money when millions of people are losing their jobs and livelihoods.

Does not really make sense there.

Then why does she need to appoint them? We know very little of her personal conversations nor much of what she tasks her advisors with.

&gt; The House of Lords is stupid. I agree. But the fault there lies in the House of Lords, not with the office of Queen.

If Elizabeth thought democracy was a good idea she could agitate for change, but because she doesn't I presume that she likes this privilege. That is at least one example where she has undeniably real political power. She is but a phone call away to the back room workings of parliament.

&gt; This is the sort of thing that David Icke comes out with. If you look at France, which has an elected president they have many issues that we have.

Does that mean it is not true? France struggles with a *de facto* monarch in terms of the defining characteristics: centralisation and protection of power across generations.

&gt; Yes, monarchs like to agitate for war and brutalise lower classes. Ours tried Nazi appeasement and got over a stammer.

I'll remind you of the context you introduced: *'We would just lose a valuable institution that has helped to define our country's history'*.

&gt; They are also some of the most gay friendly nations in the world with laws protecting from discrimination against gays. Does that mean that economic inequality also leads to acceptance of homosexuality? No. Because America does not have these laws whereas the Scandinavian countries do. There are bigger aspects of culture other than economic inequality that affect social problems.

The presentation covers research that included both social pathologies like death rates or obesity, and preferables like literacy, numeracy and social mobility. Homosexuality was perhaps a poor cherry picked example, because only Canada of the common wealth has equal marriage rights, of course the usual suspects do: Norway, Sweden, Iceland and the Netherlands. The UK has made some concessions but still legally discriminates as I imagine would the monarchy if there was ever a gay eldest son. Now that would be interesting.

&gt; So? That is to do with the upper classes having a monopoly on power. Nothing to do with the office of King or Queen.

&gt;If Elizabeth thought democracy was a good idea she could agitate for change, but because she doesn't I presume that she likes this privilege.

As far as we know she has never tried to influence politics. I think it is a given that she believes that the structure of parliament is for parliament to decide, not for her.

&gt;France struggles with a de facto monarch in terms of the defining characteristics: centralisation and protection of power across generations.

So basically it isn't the concept of monarchy and inherited office that you have a problem with at all? It is centralisation of power? Are you an anarchist?

&gt;There is relevance because you told me to 'work [my] hardest to be the best [I] can be', but there is undeniably a glass ceiling that prevents you and I from doing so.

Not at all, Thatcher, Brown, Major, Callaghan, Prescott, plenty more. There is no doubt in my mind that if someone is capable and determined then they will be able to become Prime Minister if they are from the worst background.

Martha- she learned to ""get out"" and start living her life (Rose kind of learned this too), and Donna had a lot of character progression. And so has Amy (no matter how horrible you still find her).

I don't think the Doctor chooses *broken* people. Nobody is broken. But, unless you're perfect, you can always do with some improvement. And the Doctor does make people better. Of course, from his point of view, he also corrupts people.

I think the thing we love about Rory is that he's sort a reluctant companion. Had he not been faced with losing a girl he's loved since 7 or 8, I don't think he would have traveled with the Doctor. But Rory's seen so much loss on his journey in a way that I think we downplay: his fiance ran away on the night before his wedding with a madman, he died because of the Doctor's need to investigate a crack, he was reincarnated to wait for them when they had no intention of finding him, his fiance forgot him, he was forced to kill his fiance, and then waited for her for nearly 2000 years.


And that's just the first season he was on, 7th series was equally horrifying for him. 


""The monsters and the Doctor. It seems you cannot have one without the other."" (Reinette, *Girl in the Fireplace*)


I think Rory's one of the few who considers the negative to outweigh the positive. He has all he needs, Amy and his nursing, and he doesn't need the adventures. He never gets the initial moment that the others experience of how amazing it all is. (Rose and *End of the World*, Martha and *The Shakespeare Code*, Amy and *The Beast Below* - all feature a moment where the companion thinks about how seriously cool it all is.) He mostly gets killed and loses everything he cares about repeatedly. 


That being said I think he handles it admirably. But I do think he considers the Doctor dangerous. Why wouldn't he?",0,1337495467,null,0,false,0,c4q4nof,t3_tv7qm,t1_c4q4nof,t3_tv7qm,null,1428961474,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

The closest someone went out like that was 2, but it was more of him yelling at the Time Lords because they were forcing a regeneration. However, yelling at Wilfred, of all people, like that? It just felt...wrong. Wrong and whiny.

I also didn't like just how much he yelled. It felt like he always had to yell to get his point across, where previous Doctors did things in a much more civilized manner. I've come to enjoy Silence in the Library, simply for the fact that at parts it feels like Moffat is really playing with how ten had been written. For instance, when River first shows up, and The Doctor just starts yelling at everyone to leave. Instead of listening to him like most people do, they just stare at him like he's completely mad, and basically respond with,""Who do you think you are?""

Of course, that's not to say he didn't have his moments. That's not to say there aren't parts where he really did feel like The Doctor. Just, on the whole, I never really felt him as The Doctor.

There's the rub, because what is good for the humans is almost never good for everyone else, whether the humans are right or wrong, but he has chosen to be the protector of the humans first and foremost. He brings compaions along in order to keep that in perspective. He wants them to learn, but will also always be there to pick them up when they fall. 

The issue with the making people want to impress him, is that he is special. he is smarter than us, and has an answer to almost everything, and humans in general (or at least the one's on the show) want to impress the person they are impressed by. If Superman were in trouble, you'd help him right? even if helping him had some questionable morals? even if it were dangerous? You'd help Batman, or superman, or even the green lantern, because while they are super, they needed your help, and that makes you feel special. The Doctor is not much different in that reguard. how he is different is the issue of violence. He won't partake in it, and attempts to find away without violence. 

So here you are, a companion who knows that the doctor hates violence, he's in a sticky situation, he needs your help... but you're not as smart as the doctor, you have no idea how to reverse the polarity of the nutron flow, and he isn't telling you... so what do you do? you resort to what you know, and what you know is how to hit the bad guy in the back of the head with a two by four, in order to release the doctor, so he can save the world.

A single sign is modestly priced, but they wear out/get stolen and on a national scale, that it is tens of millions of pounds being wasted on telling people to walk around a hole in the ground.

Nothing else answers the question he actually asked:     

&gt; ...remember when safety regulations, fair employment, equality laws and basic workers rights ruined the global economy?     

As far as minimum wage goes - it has also been shown, multiple times, that increasing the minimum wage moves money from the top 5% down to the bottom 95%.    

The lower someone's income the higher their expenditure back into the local economy is. Which is to say that if someone on minimum wage gets a 5% bump in their income, they will spend near 100% back into local goods and services.    

So by increasing minimum wage you actually generate jobs which in turn generate jobs, and on up until both the minimum wage earners have more opportunity, as do the richer employees supporting them in their jobs, and even up to company creating as new companies are created just to fulfil the demand created by the higher cash flow in the economy.

Ideally, that regulation would be in place and then you could happily tell failing banks to go fuck themselves, they took risks and the risks didn't pay off.

&gt; A cap on loss of earnings compensation for employees who make successful unfair dismissal claims. Payments can often total hundreds of thousands of pounds.

Not sure about this.  If the employee was unfairly dismissed, why shouldn't the employer bear the full brunt of that cost?

&gt;  Major reform of the rights that workers are allowed to ‚Äúcarry‚Äù to new employers when they are the subject of a takeover. Currently, the rights, called transfer of undertakings (TUPE), can leave people in the same company working in the same job with different levels of rights for many years.

Yet still companies think it is worth it to take each other over.

Why shouldn't employees continue to have the same rights they did before the takeover?  I don't get this.

&gt; **A role for government**

&gt;Although Hayek believed that government intervention in markets would lead to a loss of freedom, he recognized a limited role for government to perform tasks of which free markets were not capable:

&gt; * The successful use of competition as the principle of social organization precludes certain types of coercive interference with economic life, but it admits of others which sometimes may very considerably assist its work and even requires certain kinds of government action.[26]

&gt; While Hayek is opposed to regulations which restrict the freedom to enter a trade, or to buy and sell at any price, or to control quantities, he acknowledges the utility of regulations which restrict allowed methods of production, so long as these are applied equally to everyone and not used as an indirect way of controlling prices or quantities, and without forgetting the cost of such restrictions:

&gt; * To prohibit the use of certain poisonous substances, or to require special precautions in their use, to limit working hours or to require certain sanitary arrangements, is fully compatible with the preservation of competition. The only question here is whether in the particular instance the advantages gained are greater than the social costs which they impose.[27]

&gt;He notes that there are certain areas, such as the environment, where activities which cause damage to third parties (known to economists as ""negative externalities"") cannot effectively be regulated solely by the marketplace:

&gt; * Nor can certain harmful effects of deforestation, of some methods of farming, or of the smoke and noise of factories, be confined to the owner of the property in question, or to those who are willing to submit to the damage for an agreed compensation.[28]

&gt;The government also has a role in preventing fraud:

&gt; * Even the most essential prerequisite of its [the market's] proper functioning, the prevention of fraud and deception (including exploitation of ignorance), provides a great and by no means fully accomplished object of legislative activity.[29]

&gt; The government also has a role in creating a safety net:

&gt; * There is no reason why, in a society which has reached the general level of wealth ours has, the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom; that is: some minimum of food, shelter and clothing, sufficient to preserve health. Nor is there any reason why the state should not help to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance in providing for those common hazards of life against which few can make adequate provision.[30][31]

&gt;He concludes: ""In no system that could be rationally defended would the state just do nothing.""[29]

Well, as it happens, sub-prime mortgages are a very good idea as they enable poor people to buy homes.

What went wrong was that they were over-sold to consumers who couldn't actually afford them, and sold as prime-mortgages to investors.

When they folded, the investors found that their risk ratio was totally wrong and that caused economic contagion.

Investing in sub-prime anything is a viable strategy - so long as everyone knows it is a risky investment.

""Given their high rates of unemployment, the need for reform has been most pressing in European countries. Selected features of reforms in some of these countries have involved reduction in labour costs for targeted groups, greater use of in-work financial support for low-wage earners, an adjustment of employment protection legislation for temporary and/or permanent workers, increased work incentives via more demanding entitlement conditions for unemployment benefits, and product market reforms.""

But I do attend a medical school in the north so that may have some influence. 

Most medical schools have some sort of access program for local students which are generally very successful. 

On the topic of pensions I agree that there is much discontent, but I would say most doctors arn't in it for the money.   However I do get the general feeling from doctors and colleagues that we have been shafted.  We had a pension reform 4 years ago which generates a positive income and now they are overhauling it again radically,  there has be absolutely no negotiation.  

Personally I think the government has become content that they can do whatever they want with the NHS and doctors and any backlash can be dismissed as doctors can't be seen to put patients lives at risk and there is not much public sympathy for people that earn ~¬£100,000 per year.

You'll doubtless be pleased to hear then that we learned nothing from the 2008 crash - those institutions which were ""too big to fail"" then are bigger and more prone to failure than ever.

&gt;Ideally, that regulation would be in place

Much of this regulation used to be in place, and it was carefully, quietly and systematically dismantled by those profiting most from the casino aspects of the financial sector over many decades of the last century (clue: that's not you and I, but it does include much of the plutocratic and political class).  Those who achieved this got stung by the collapse it's true, but nowhere near as much as the rest of us, besides, they got a substantial chunk of their losses back care of the State, palmed off onto taxpayers.  In any event, what really matters is not their overall bottom line, but how much more than the rest of us they have, because that's what provides them leverage, political control and the ability to live well without the need to work for a living.  They're fine thanks, they'd do it all again in an instant if they could - and they can - and they will.  Indeed, if the best you and other ""progressives"" can come up with is to put a bunch of ""regulations"" in place, like you did after the last great depression, they won't bat an eyelid and they'll just set to work dismantling, outmaneuvering, side-stepping, subverting, overturning, corrupting, and buying them out again, just as they did last time round.

A person on a minimum wage in our current times is much richer than a century ago .

true,teff,uk,"""dwellings by the weir""","&gt;&gt;An end to provisions in the Equality Act which make employers liable for claims from employees for ‚Äúthird party harassment‚Äù ‚Äî for example, customers making ‚Äúsexist‚Äù comments to staff in a restaurant. The Government has already begun a consultation on the issue.

&gt;Sounds OK at face value.

The actual part of the equality act - Provision 40 - that this applies, states the following:

http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/40

    40 Employees and applicants: harassment

        (1)An employer (A) must not, in relation to employment by A, harass a person (B)‚Äî
            (a)who is an employee of A's;
            (b)who has applied to A for employment.

        (2)The circumstances in which A is to be treated as harassing B under subsection (1) include those where‚Äî
            (a)a third party harasses B in the course of B's employment, and
            (b)A failed to take such steps as would have been reasonably practicable to prevent the third party from doing so.
        (3)Subsection (2) does not apply unless A knows that B has been harassed in the course of B's employment on at least two other occasions by a third party; and it does not matter whether the third party is the same or a different person on each occasion.
        (4)A third party is a person other than‚Äî
            (a)A, or
            (b)an employee of A's.                                    

Which doesn't really seem that much of a burden to the employer, they are just required to take reasonable steps to avoid the situation. 

The example used seems to me to be intentionally soft, so that people will feel ditching the provision is sensible, but it also seems like it would be almost unpreventable unless an atmosphere where that sort of thing is ok had already been garnered by the employer, so is unlikely to be covered by that provision alone anyway.

true,bigbadbass,null,null,"So you go here: http://www.ladbrokes.com/home/en

And it says deposit and bet 50, get a free 50 bet. So you find something to back, for arguments sake let's say it's Spurs to beat Arsenal.

Now, before I go on, you can bet with a bookie (ladbrokes, wilhill etc), or an exchange (there's only really 3, and Betfair is much larger than Betdaq and smarkets). 

A bookie/bookmaker creates a book, and punters can back selections on the book for the agreed price.

On an exchange, there is no bookie, just other punters. So punters take on the role of the bookie at an exchange, and lay selections on the book. (So when you back something to win, the bookie lays that something to win. **Lay means you are betting it will not happen**). So if I was to back Spurs to win, I get paid if Spurs win. If I was to lay Spurs to win, I would get paid if any other outcome occurred (in footballs case, a draw or loss). 

If you don't get this bit, google backing and laying.

So once you have deposited into the bookie (ladbrokes) your 50, you back Spurs to win at 2.0 (evens, it will be decimal odds from here on to make the maths easier). 50 on 2.0 gives a profit of 50, a return of 100 (inc. stake). To make this risk free, we need to go on to an Exchange, and lay the same selection. So we would lay Spurs to win at 2.0, having a liability of 50, and a profit of 50 if Spurs don't win. No matter the outcome, you neither lose or gain any money, it will just be in the bookie or the exchange.

Now you have your 50 free bet to play with, you do the same as above, but this time no matter the outcome of the event you are betting on, you will make a profit (an equal profit, if you do your maths correctly). The difference now, is that the stake will not be returned in your winnings (as it was a free bet), so you should make around ¬£40 from the 50 free bet.

[Here](http://www.thepoorhouse.org.uk/matched_betting_calculator) is a calculator for working out the bets with different odds and if the stake is included in your winnings.

This is a basic example, the offers can be more complex, and the odds don't always match and you will have to take small losses in your 'qualifier' bets (the first one).

of course i'm going to pay for it, so are you and everyone else that benefits from it - that's how society works and has always worked.  Serfs got somewhere to live, food and various religious duties all provided for them because those were thing things needed to maintain a serf's mind and body while he worked.  The cost of living in a society with plenty of food and rousable armies was that a society needed to be provided in which these people could survive and live, actually a lot of the time they lived rather pleasantly all things considered.  Today we have a much more complex economy, we need people with big clever brains to do things like computer programming and robot inventing - this means they need a lot more things to keep them functioning; high quality education means a demand for higher quality entertainment and etc, of course it does - how could it not?  
  
so to provide a world in which these people work we need the people that make it nice for them, and the people that make it nice for them and etc right down to the lower strata.  You can't have people on one hand able to understand their complex jobs and on the other so dumb they'll be entertained by a twopenny clown show - that's not how people work.  
  
So of course we're going to have to pay for it, it's absurd that we've let it get to such ridiculous levels of disparity as it is; remember that money isn't some magical thing sent by god, it's a metaphor created by man to quantify the shared contribution to the national production potential.  Put simply it's a token of 'work done' and should be treated as such, saying money doesn't grow on trees is ridiculous, of course it doesn't - it's simply made up out of thin air!  growing the stuff on trees would be far too much work!

true,schoettchen,cnty-scotland,D√πn √àideann,"Your post seems slightly hysterical, I'd like to share my experience of working in a country with a deregulated jobs market- Germany.

As most know Germany has the highest economic growth in Europe, as well as some of the lowest unemployment in the southern states. Now although Germany's job market is ""deregulated"", a lot more than the UKs, it is not as though it's the same as informal economies in developing countries: all workers still have rights. For a part time job, you can expect to earn 400‚Ç¨ a month, in fact this is the law, and on this wage you pay no tax, and work no more than 20 hours a week. 

There is essentially no minimum wage in Germany, however the regulations on the 400‚Ç¨ jobs ensure that you are never working for nothing.

Now the 400‚Ç¨ you get is enough to live fairly modestly, most people working on these jobs will have some other form of income anyway, however it is a lot less than the country's average net salary of 2040‚Ç¨ (quoting Wikipedia so don't hold me to it), and the jobs worked are under-average paying in most countries anyway (waitering part time is a typical 400‚Ç¨ job) is, however the low 400‚Ç¨ (plus medical insurance) provided by the employer (required by law), equaling less than 500‚Ç¨/month is a good deal for them, meaning that businesses can usually afford to take on more staff on this basis.

Employees are also entitled to time off, and flexibility, however this might be more dependent on the employer. Also most 400‚Ç¨ workers are not bound by a contract, and are in a sense quite ""disposable"", meaning that the turnover rate of employees can be relatively high, however this adds to a sense of economic dynamism, as it is relatively easy to find a 400‚Ç¨ job to tide you over till something you want to do comes along.

I hope you can see that deregulation of the job market is not simply taking away employment rights, and can actually be a really good way to increase employment.

tl;dr Germany has deregulated employment laws, as well as good rights for employees, as well as a dynamic jobs market where it is relatively easy to find a non-professional job.",0,1337517604,null,0,false,0,c4q6fao,t3_tvrzq,t1_c4q6fao,t1_c4q5swd,null,1428962307,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

- Easier redundancies

This just encourages poor planning. As has often been said to me, a redundancy is not so much the person is redundant but the role itself is. An overambitious company can expand and contract much faster. Is it a good thing? I don't know.

- Cap on loss of earnings

Don't quite see how this is a good thing. If you're awarded a sum, surely that is in line with how much you genuinely have lost? Seems to me that businesses complaining here are the ones that have been stung for unfairly dismissing employees, otherwise why would you be complaining? This legislation should be left alone. It's concerning that this has been brought up.

- Rights reform

This will likely empower employers to push down wages when they take over a business and allow them to scrap all existing contracts. It's the only way I could see it being able to 'deliver growth'. Definitely would be cheaper, but it's not good if true. I wonder if it would affect things like holiday entitlement and such as.

- Third-party liability

This is agreeable. I can't think of a case as to why the employer is responsible for their employee outside work. I equally feel this should be in reverse; it should be illegal for anything the employee does outside work to be able to impact them in work. I've heard a few cases of people being sacked because they state on Facebook that they don't like their manager or something at work and they get into trouble. We need to establish a clear line separating the two.

- Responsibility for checking foreign workers

This... is contrary to the whole 'smaller state' thing. It actively encourages businesses to potentially employ illegal immigrants as they will not be performing checks. A more fundamentally simple system could be implemented, but scrapping employer responsibility altogether is irresponsible in itself.",0,1337519041,null,0,false,0,c4q6k3s,t3_tvrzq,t1_c4q6k3s,t3_tvrzq,null,1428962369,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

In material terms, compared to 90% of the population of the Earth, you may be right. But I find it hard to accept that poverty doesn't exist in our society. I think people in rich countries would do well to remember how well off we are but I think its cruel to dismiss poverty.

Displaying a swastika in China and displaying one in Germany will have completely different effects due to the culture reflecting on it.  My initial point was, you have a very ethnocentric view on  this subject.  Perhaps you think a flag is dumb, but to Americans, the flag stands for something.  It stands for courage, freedom, and sacrifice, while the head of a monarchy would symbolize almost the complete opposite, based upon our cultural values and history.  You make a valid point about symbols being able to change.  For instance, the American flag stood for freedom, hope, and opportunity for many people around the world in its past, but lately, could be viewed as a symbol of imperialism and destruction instead.  However, the same goes for the Royals.  Not every king or queen in England's history was so revered as Elizabeth.  There were times when the monarchy was a symbol of tyranny and imperialism as well.  So, you can't argue that one is greater than the other.  It's quite silly to argue that paying homage to a Queen is a superior method of paying respect to a country's heritage than saluting a flag because a flag is inanimate.

Sandro and Huddlestone would play a more defensive role than Modric and Parker, simply due to the fact that Modric is much more mobile than Huddlestone is. Functionally, I could actually see this being more of a 4-3-3 type thing, with Sandro in the destroyer role, Huddlestone being the passer, and Van der Vaart in the creative playmaker role in midfield and Bale and Lennon playing higher on the pitch than we've been accustomed to (and hopefully staying wide, in Bale's case). 

The biggest thing is that Huddlestone for Modric is not a straight swap, they have different strengths, and that allows other players to take up different roles. THudd is by far the best long-distance passer we have; if he recovers the ball outside our box, he'll be able to put the ball at Bale's feet past the halfway line 9 out of 10 times, and he's a more physical presence in midfield than Modders.

I don't think you understand that law. It was brought in because of the Bernard Manning case.

http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/in-practice/practice-points/third-party-harassment
&gt; The legal framework protecting employees from acts of harassment by third parties originates from case law, including the infamous decision in Burton and another v De Vere Hotels Ltd [1997], commonly known as the ‚ÄòBernard Manning‚Äô case. De Vere Hotels was found liable for the harassment of two of its staff who became the subject of the comedian‚Äôs racist and sexist jokes during his performance, despite the fact that he was not an employee of the hotel group. Essentially, De Vere Hotels was held liable for failing to take steps to prevent the discrimination complained of from taking place.

So it is for occasions where an employer would rather let their staff work in openly hostile environments than potentially upset a third party.

If they want any perks like alcohol, cigarettes, satellite television, cars, holidays they would have to work for it. The food system would function using a debit card that can only be used to buy the aforementioned items. The accommodation would be the cheapest rental places along with efficient new builds if necessary.  
  
The people who made use of it would not be scamming the system because everyone would be entitled to it. There would be a strong incentive to work in order to buy luxuries but there wouldn't be the bureaucracy and degradation of the benefits system.  
  
I think this would lead to a happier, healthier society. Those who don't mind basic living could focus on educating themselves, training, starting businesses, getting fit and generally living life without fear of hardship or persecution, in order to persue a career they actually want.  
  
I don't believe the costs would be too high, after all, one farmer can feed many people, one power station can power many homes.  
  
This is making me wonder why there's a crisis in the first place and why there are people starving in the world when one person can support many, using resources that exist naturally.  
  
It seems to me that the problem is the people in power and the rich, who want to keep everyone else working and having high living costs to provide for their comfortable lifestyle, when in reality there would be no need for a 40 hour, high stress work week if we worked together to provide for each other. There's a cycle making the rich richer and the rest poorer; as more of the money flows to the rich, the rest of us have to keep working harder to make ends meet and the rich can buy more land, resources and housing, pushing the prices up and then charging us to use them.

They won't be earning forever, and it's irresponsible for people to just live their lives day to day without any responsibility for their own futures. Someone is going to have to pay for their retirement. It's short sighted to not save anything.

&gt;Spending money is good for the economy (apparently) and it's their money to decide how to spend it. Don't forget they are giving up their most valuable asset, time, to allow those at the top to live in comfort.

Spending is fine, and buying nice stuff is fine. But it was irresponsible behaviour which got us into this problem in the first place.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It does depend on location but if you link local incomes and employment to house prices you find a similar pattern. Places where there are cheaper properties also tend to have limited job opportunities - you may find somewhere to live, but may not find somewhere to work.

I lived in Grimsby for 5 months which was cheap as piss (could buy a nice house for ¬£90k-¬£100k) however I didn't gain any employment in that time. I then found employment in Cheltenham but the average house price here is ¬£248k. I pay ¬£390 PCM sharing a house with 4 others (inclusive).

I think its difficult because its not comparing like with like. If you wanted a fair representation then I think you would calculate:

- median income of area

- median living expenses (bills, utilities, groceries, pint of beer etc.)

- median house price

and then work out the ratio between the three. Places with significantly better incomes vs expenses / house prices would be better, vs places with smaller incomes vs expenses / house prices.

As is you just can't make any summative statements about the entire country, although anecdotally I think it is fair to say that the current generation of 20-35 year olds are going to have a much harder time owning their own place than the last generation of 20-35 year olds, *regardless* of where they live in the UK.
