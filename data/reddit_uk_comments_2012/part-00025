It is defined by three attitudinal and behavioral clusters which correlate together:

&gt;**Authoritarian submission** — a high degree of submissiveness to the authorities who are perceived to be established and legitimate in the society in which one lives.

&gt;**Authoritarian aggression** — a general aggressiveness directed against deviants, outgroups, and other people that are perceived to be targets according to established authorities.

&gt;**Conventionalism** — a high degree of adherence to the traditions and social norms that are perceived to be endorsed by society and its established authorities, and a belief that others in one's society should also be required to adhere to these norms.

He sued Google because someone published a couple of mean comments on a Blogger post? http://i.imgur.com/vPGOL.jpg

And who the fuck still says ""*on-line*""? It's not the '90s, Telegraph.

(Also, I wonder if companies were talking up how many they would recruit and on what rate, as a PR ""we're doing just fine"" strategy. A retrospective look would be useful.)

Sadly, engineering was badly hit by the recession -- civil engineering was seriously down before the rest of the world realised what was going on. So the never-generous starting salaries got worse. Which seems crazy when other fields like banking love to hoover up numerate graduates -- though the highest rates are paid by the ""recruit 12, sack 6 within a year"" type of employer. If you are a civil engineer, you may see the first signs of a real upturn. (If you are free to move, Australia and NZ didn't feel things as badly and are recruiting -- but that is also partly because their own graduates tend to move abroad.)

You are probably still young enough to move into banking, but that would mean spending your days with people who think money is everything, a lot of sane people just can't take it. And engineering does feel more useful to the world.

Its not a questions of whether you want everything for free or not; its about whether the UK thinks it wants to forever punish copyright infringement as a criminal offence or have copyright terms where the american's have it now. It may pass that the UK believes its better for innovation for a more balanced approach to copyright. But this debate won't have a point when your locked into international treaties like ACTA/TPP.

I'm not saying there isn't a need for harmonization of copyright law; but we already have an open multi-lateral process through the WTO. And we need it to be an open multi-lateral process because its supposed to be a big deal when you give up some of your sovereignty.",0,1330780915,null,0,false,0,c3x9yil,t3_qftq3,t1_c3x9yil,t1_c3x9wrl,null,1428460287,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Now we have the Conservatives who do nothing but lie for years for their own gains, maybe trying to do good but generally just fucking it all up.

Maybe some public services should be run at loss. It would be great if they all ran super efficiently and generated a profit and cost us sod all and worked really well. Maybe we should just take it on the chin as a nation and just pony up the cash in exchange for something we all want, like a copper who is not trying to make money from arresting you. 

Or a Doctor who does not want to take you as a patient because the disease you have is too expensive. 

Or a train system that charges you a price for a journey that does not make you poo yourself a little in fear. 

Or an armed forces that defends the little island we live on, that no one wants to invade, and does not become embroiled in the misadventures of other countries. 

Or a financial institution that is allowed to fail, and held accountable for that failure, if it makes a boatload of stupid investments.

Or a benefits system that does not treat every claimant as a workshy criminal, and has the tools it needs to catch and punish people that abuse it.

If the taxes I pay as a citizen is not enough to run all this, then we cant have it, and that is fair enough. But the income of the country is more than enough to pay for it. There are only 60 million of us, and we are still one of the richest countries ever. We are an amazing people who allowing everything we take for granted to be slowly drained away for the profit of others who care nothing for us.

This breeds a sort of pride in ones religion and you get people who take things too far, especially people from low income areas who then take this pride and use it to discriminate anyone who's different. I could elaborate more if you want but I digress. 

Not really sure if you're talking about Primary or secondary schools but primary schools usually the above isn't a problem. Secondary schools come both in the form of ""Grammar schools"" and ""high schools"", people who pass their 11+ exam with an A, B1 or B2 tend to go to Grammar school so you get the separation of what people think is an intelligence line, this again can cause problems.

We really missed our captain today. When Stevie is on the pitch, he makes sure everyone does their job, not to mention that he most likely would have buried that penalty.

It's really tough to see us dominate for about 85 minutes of the game and not actually score. I'm not sure where the finishing is going to come from, but it needs to be there. Suarez looked good in the first half, but he seemed to be a bit tired in the second. You can't blame him, especially after this wednesday match with Uruguay.

Carra wasn't in top form today, but he needs to pick it up fast, looking at how Agger will be out for a couple weeks at the minimum. More important than that, though, is the quality in the final third. This is a pressing concern going forward. Now that top four is basically out of the picture unless we get incredibly lucky, we need to concentrate on the cup double. To win that, we're going to need to beat some good teams. To beat good teams we desperately need to finish.

Finally, while I love KD and everything he's done for the club over his life, it might be time for him to reconsider his manager role. He may not have what it takes to be a successful manager for a top tier team like Liverpool in modern football. Knowing him, though, if this was the case, he would step down for the team to hire a better manager for the good of the team.

Any idea how much money? We're already in the Europa league, so 5th doesn't offer that additionally. If I were to submit a guess, the difference between 5th and 9th is probably only 3-5 million pounds at the maximum. EDIT - It would cost us about 2-4 million to finish 9th instead of 5th. Far less than we've already lost out on from missing CL football. 

&gt; There's also a chance that other clubs will slip up and and we sneak our way into 4th, stranger things have happened.

I just don't see any realistic chance for it to happen. Sure, crazier things have happened but we're 10 points behind 4th currently. Let's be generous and say we're 7 as we have a game in hand with 11 additional matches remaining. So at best we'll be 7 points back with 11 games remaining. 

We would have to gain more than 1 point on Arsenal every two games - meaning Arsenal will have to lose or draw at least 1 of every 2. Don't see this happening. Given our record I'm fairly certain we will slip up and lose to at least one more mid/lower table side this season.

The first time we meet the Daleks is in the second ever episode. They were supposedly destroyed for good but due to their success with viewers we meet them again in The Dalek Invasion of Earth. The Doctor mentions that these Daleks are more advanced. Quite how these Daleks came about after the Doctor destroyed the Dalek city on Skaro is not known... the 'Oncoming storm' could refer to how the 7th incarnation of the Doctor tricked the Daleks into destroying their home planet, Skaro in 'Remembrance of the Daleks'. This wouldn't have destroyed them (like the 1st Doctor did - or the 4th could have) as they had many colonies on other planets by this point in their timeline, but it would have been worthy of a nickname.

true,tamuowen,lfc68,null,"Can't sell Carroll. We would almost certainly take a *huge* hit on him. I can't imagine anyone being willing to pay more than 15 million, and 10 is probably more realistic. 

I would support a loan to an EPL side but frankly I think Andy just needs better service and more regular first-team time. He's only gotten good service in a few games this season and he's threatened or scored a good amount in those games. Furthermore, his big presence on corners has won us at least two goals for other players this season. 

I think Carroll just needs a steady supply and then he will find his form again. He's just been really inconsistent so far - even in his best games he has some pretty bad moments. But he also has moments of great hold-up play, strong heading, and a powerful strike. He's going to waste some chances - all players will - but I think he will waste a lower % of those chances once he starts trying to get to 20+ balls a game, as opposed to the 5-10 he's getting right now. Some of his biggest problems are positioning and tactical; I have to think that a good manager will help him improve substantially in that area. 

I still think Andy has all the tools to be a good player for us. He's not good enough right now - so let's play him all of the remaining games this season and let him improve. Other than the FA cup, this season is effectively over. See what he has and how far he needs to go. Perhaps he'll never be a 30 goal a season terror, but I see no reason Carroll shouldn't or won't be scoring 15 league goals in a season or two. Let's give him an opportunity to prove himself; I really think he has been playing far better lately and he finally has Gerrard (mostly) back. Let's not forget that Carroll has yet to play on a team with Gerrard, Lucas, Suarez, and a competent winger (Kuyt/Bellamy/Downing in one of his few useful games). AFAIK Carroll hasn't played more than 3 games with all of the above players - we've been struggling to find consistency all over the pitch and that has certainly hurt Andy through no fault of his own.

Downing was likewise probably too expensive to sell, and should at least be a useful squad player with Maxi and Kuyt aging. No reason to sell him, although he should certainly ride the bench if his performance gets any worse. A loan wouldn't be terrible but frankly I think we need the depth and would not get any real value out of selling him. Downing's been very good for England; you have to think that when the squad sorts some of its other issues out he will be at least a competent player for us. 

Adam is perfectly fine in the role we bought him for - 3rd or 4th midfielder on the Squad. A healthy Gerrard, Lucas, and probably Henderson should be ahead of him in the midfield. Problem is that we're injured and players are under-performing. Adam was never meant to be more than a useful player who could fill in for 2-4 games at a time and occasionally come off of the bench. 

I see no reason at all to sell Henderson, or even loan him. Even if he continues to struggle he's more than good enough to play in League cup and Europe league games. He's shown incredible technical ability and can put some serious movement on the ball. His problems haven't come from clumsiness or stupid tackles like Adam, or even the wastefulness that Adam sometimes displays. Henderson just hasn't been incisive, forward, or creative enough. He seems hesitant to make a cutting forward pass, yet he shows the ability to do so. He's very young and I have to think that the increase in stage and spotlight has intimidated him slightly. This will change sooner rather than later, and a mature and decisive Henderson is exactly the type of complete and technically solid midfielder I want to play for Liverpool.

These days I live on the edge of a predominantly white community that is bordered by a predominantly Asian (Pakistani) community and it troubles me deeply that I hardly ever see ""mixed"" groups of kids playing together – they're either all white or all Asian. That can only be down to parents on both sides influencing their kids to distrust and avoid the ""others"".

Agger and Skrtel are both amazing and Reina I also rate very highly. He's kept us in a lot of games in the past and IMO is one of the best keepers in the league.

Their research has allowed Catkind come to be.

Through the human genome an other still living genomes they have been able to capture DNA from many lost species of plants and animals that used to be on old earth.

The only thing is, they have to use natural humans or organisms that have no genetic tampering in their bloodline, certain selective breeding in the past is allowed for samples to be taken but anyone who has had gene therapy in their lineage is disqualified. This rules out most domestic plants and animals, and many wild earth animals have been wiped off the face of the universe. Their mission to have a ""Noah's Arc"" of DNA history for the planet earth. 

The branch the Doctor and his companions comes across is focusing on 20th century European mammals small to mid range. Something about the team of researchers piques the Doctor's interest and using his physic paper he says he is there for ""inspection"" of the lab.

Of course Amy and Rory aren't interested in any lab and instead wander the city where they come across a lady named Inka and her spouse a woman named Abby, and their biological child, Kaylee. Kaylee likes Amy and Rory and clings to them while Inka shows them around their shop, a book store and one of the few on New Earth left in existence. Amy can't help but notice how much like her mothers Kaylee is and asks if she was adopted or biological. Inka reveals that Abby had gene therapy to change her gender to female after Kaylee was born and that Abby had been born biologically male. Such procedures for transgender persons are becoming common place with gene therapy. She also reveals in the conversation that her line is one of the few without gene therapy since it became common place, as was Abby's before she transitioned, which also makes Kaylee one of the youngest natural humans in the universe.

The Doctor re-joins the others and while Inka and her family escort them back to the Tardis, little Kaylee goes missing. In the search they come across one of the lab technicians from the Noah's Arc project who Inka recognizes immediately accuses of abducting her daughter. It turns out that Inka's medical records have shown to have the structure of a large portion of the European weasel family in her DNA history but Inka refuses to give them enough samples to finish their Noah's Arc because last time, they got so carried away they almost killed her.

Can they find little Kaylee, the youngest natural human in the universe before the researchers suck her dry or will Inka the last human who holds the keys to the DNA of the European badger relent and sacrifice herself for her daughter, or can the Doctor save this family even if it means possible shutting down the Noah's Arc project and changing the course of history?",0,1330796452,null,0,false,0,c3xbmbc,t3_qfx15,t1_c3xbmbc,t3_qfx15,null,1428461141,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

We have not played particularly well (Newcastle beatdown and City second half notwithstanding) for the past few months. We've become sloppy and undisciplined in defense and even more wasteful in attack.

I think it's arrogance, honestly. We try to play this stupid fluid system whether we're playing Norwich or Arsenal and defensively we are shaky at best because of it.

We need to get back to basics. We have so much talent that the hot sexual chocolate football will come naturally, but the players have to be more disciplined and play their positions. It's not just Bale; it's the entire fucking midfield. 

Hopefully Lennon's actually back tomorrow and we can revert to the 4-4-1-1 with VDV behind Adebayor. Surely the 5-0 Newcastle game isn't going to be justification for Harry to play 4-4-2 every fucking week now. 

I'm not a tactical expert but even a fan with a cursory understanding of the game can see what's been going on lately. We've gotten carried away with the sexiness and we've finally been punished for it. Even against lesser opposition there were moments where everyone kind of winced and knew that a better team would have punished us.

We have the players to do that, but I'm increasingly starting to believe we don't have a manager capable of producing it consistently. Obviously not calling for Harry's head as he's been unarguably brilliant for us, but can he really be the man to take us to the next level? If we slip to 4th with THIS squad after squandering a 10 point gap, I'm not so sure. 

I don't want Spurs to stop playing attacking football, but last season at times Harry proved that when the stakes were high enough he was capable of setting out a team that seemed to give a shit about restricting space and playing defense.

We beat AC Milan in their building without Bale and with Modric only fit enough for 30 minutes off the bench. And we did it because we had two wingers who worked their asses off in defense and two midfielders who stayed disciplined and didn't get carried away. 

I'm not saying we should play on the break constantly, but even the most successful fluid attacking teams are incredibly consistent and (here's that word again) disciplined with their overall defensive approach.

An episode's first airing on BBC America *will* have commercials spliced in, but nothing cut out.

However, since most episodes are a bit long to fit in a 60-minute slot with the standard amount of commercials, on subsequent airings yes, things are cut out.

But this is true of *every* show in the US that airs with commercials.  Reruns will always have things cut out to fit more commercials in - they're called ""syndication cuts.""

This is not a new thing at all.  In fact, the *That '70s Show* DVDs accidentally(?) used the syndication cuts instead of the uncut versions.  Also, I particularly hate watching *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia* on Comedy Central, since they often cut very funny jokes in order to fit in more commercials.

I'm not saying it's right, I'm just saying it's business as usual for the US.

But honestly if we don't even get that it's not the worst thing in the world and here's why. This summer is going to be massive - there need to be at least 3 or 4 new impact players in exchange for deadweight let off, and the rising youth (Kakuta, Piazon, Mceachran, etc) need to be integrated as well. So even if we don't get into the CL next year, it's not the end of the world because it allows our squad to adapt to itself in the league without the intense pressures and time commitments/travel of the tournament. And then next season as that happens you have an eye towards top four/other trophies, and in two years time hopefully a pretty good looking squad that can make a legitimate run. That's the 3 year plan AVB's been trying to make people understand, I think. Let's hope that people can use some logical reasoning and see beyond short sighted glory-hunting.

After quickly introducing himself with ""Call me the Doctor,"" the Doctor soon gains the trust of the captain and is invited on board. With his companions, they man the rest of the crew and are able to set off on the journey.

At first everything seems normal, but soon the Doctor begins to realize that the captain has gone mad. Obsessed with trying to find this so called space dragon, he drives the crew to search out this creature. The only question on his mind as they go from location to location is ""Where be dragon?"" The Doctor even discovers that the captain has brought his own secret crew including a mysterious, grim dragon-catcher named Ketchallah.

After several harrowing adventures and the loss of a few crew members, the ship finally catches up with the dragon. Ketchallah in his lust to capture the creature, leaps out in order to capture the dragon but is soon swept away. In doing so, however, the dragon fights back and damages the ships' systems.

Days pass with no help and the crew becomes worried that they will starve before they are able to escape. As they are giving up hope, however, they are inadvertently sucked into a wormhole and land up in a strange lake next to an industrialized city. While the area looks similar to the Earth that the Doctor is used to, strange creatures are milling around everywhere and interacting with humans.

The doctor travels to the year 2002 In which he finds that the earth has been decimated by a cataclysmic event the previous year, he hops into his tardis and goes back to 2001 here he searches for this certain event, at this time the doctor is knocked unconscious and his tardis taken. He wakes up later in a cell with no records and not a full name (as his psychic paper is in the tardis along with his sonic screwdriver) he is put into a mental hospital when he tries to explain who he is and what he is trying to do. The plot basically is a paraphrased version of twelve monkeys but in which the doctor himself causes the cataclysmic event that wipes out the majority of civilisation when he breaks free of the mental hospital and tries to claim back his tardis from the military which found it and is examining it. The military tries to draw power from it but manages to cause a leak from the tardis' power source. When the doctor gets there it is too late for him to stop it and the implosion of the tardis sends out a wave that erases people from time with the exception of time travellers and a few people in protected areas.

The Time Lord turns out to be a girl who's breaking through the Time Lock and ends up in the TARDIS, where she passes out and is forced to regenerate, because her body couldn't stand the pressure of leaving. She regenerates into a boy, and upon awakening, renames herself Silgrenus. Silgrenus finds out that the Doctor sealed away Gallifrey and goes ballistic, trying to destory the Doctor. He manipulates the TARDIS to crash land on a planet, and begins doing crazy shit in order to ensure that the Doctor is killed. Eventually, the Doctor convinces Silgrenus to join him as the two search for a way to bring back Gallifrey, with Silgrenus secretly planning on killing the Doctor as soon as it happens. After one or two seasons of SUBTLE buildup (Looking at you, Moffat), it's revealed that the Trickster promised Silgrenus escape in exchange for the Doctor's death, as there were three Time Ladies in existence, so the species could still be repopulated (Jenny, Donna, River). It's also revealed that Silgrenus is actually an experiment, a test to see if Time Lords will be able to ascend into a being of consciousness, that succeeded, as he's occasionally able to become a stream of golden time-dust, like in 'Bad Wolf', which is how the Trickster was able to get her out of the Lock in the first place. However, upon learning that Jenny, Donna and River are 'watered-down' Time Ladies, Silgrenus attacks the Trickster, and ends up back in Gallifrey, leaving the Doctor alone once again. Throughout all this, however, Silgrenus never became the Doctor's friend, always hating him.

The Doctor travels to the 90s and meets up with a sassy teenaged black girl who has developed psychic powers.

The Master steals the TaRDiS and escapes, leaving the Doctor trapped in the belly of the beast, but it turns out The Doctor speaks lion, having spent two weeks in Africa helping a native family find their missing in the savannah.

true,ProjectAzar,null,null,"The Doctor is having an unusually unlucky day. Which is strange, as the Doctor is usually quite lucky in his unluckiness. Not today. They are flying through space when the Tardis makes a hard impact into a planet which the Doctor wasn't expecting, as if he just crashed into one. The Tardis is lying on its side, much like in the opening of Series 5. As the Doctor and companions investigate, more and more unlucky things start to happen. He rips his coat, he loose a shoe, and his sonic screw driver even runs out of power, right as they are being chased by something. This strikes the Doctor as odd as his sonic screwdriver is not powered by any normal power source, but instead feeds off the energy of the Time Warp, as it is leaked from the TARDIS. He assumes this is due to the damage the TARDIS suffered earlier.

They manage to get away from whatever was chasing them, but the Doctor is now determined to figure out whats going on. He and his companion(s) split up and search for the culprit of their troubles. A companion locates what appears to be a large computer generating a series of random numbers, and the keyword ""Doctor"" on the screen. Every so often the numbers flash and something bad happens to the Doctor. The companion tries to call to the Doctor, but the Doctor's communication device is broken, and so all he hears is, Doctor...lucky. 

The Doctor gets captured by the big thing that was following them, we shall call it a probability monster, which is highly improbable. The Doctor is taken before the PBM's master and the big bad guy explains his plan to take over the universe by mastering chance. All the while the unlucky machine is going on in the background. 

The companions are then drawn in and the doctor is given a choice. A very unlucky choice, to choose between saving his companions by leaving them forever (as it is only his luck that is bad) and staying as prisoner of the evil guy, or he can try to fight it out, but given how things have been so unlucky for the doctor it would likely mean his and his companions death.

A seemingly unwinnable situation, the Doctor cleverly realizes he can use his own unluckiness to his advantage. After stalling the BBG for a while, as he inches to the big computer, he runs towards the computer and begins typing. At which point the PBM attacks on the BBGs orders, and breaks the computer terminal.  

Things look grim as teh BBG says that now the Probability Machine which was making the doctor unlucky is now permanent as the console is broken, but the computer keeps running. The Doctor laughs a bit and says, ""Well thats unlucky isn't it. While trying to change my lucky, I seem to activate the self destruct sequence for this whole complex, I was trying desperately to stop it when your beast attacked me. It seems we only have minutes to leave.""  Thus begins the great running sequence to flee the chambers and the complex before it blows up. But as they are running the doctor trips, and hits the door lock mechanism and breaks it, trapping the BBG and the PBM in the chamber, but the doctor just manages to get out of the door. They run to the TARDIS, dive in with a crash, and fly it out of there. Before they can though, they are having trouble starting the old girl. Then an explosion and things just start working again. The doctor quips, ""Seems my bad luck just blew itself away"" as the Probability Manipulator had exploded first, ending the program causing the doctors troubles.

They fly away to safety as the BBG cries out, ""NOOO! This out come was impossible!"". The doctor sees this on his screen in the TARDIS, and says, No. Not impossible. Just highly improbable.

The companion gets kidnapped by the baddies in an effort to force the doctors hand, and just when everything seems hopeless the painter sacrifices his/herself up to save the universe. The doctors gets really sad he couldn't save them, and upon returning to the future discovers a final painting, a new one, that they did right before they went off and did the sacrifice thing. Its basically a thank you to the doctor.

You're talking bullshit. What Chomsky does is he takes things that are common sense, and posits them into theories. That isn't a criticism by the way, I'm a huge fan. Chomsky never said:

""HEY MAAAAN, THE GOVERNMENT IS MANIPULATING THE MEDIA AND ITS A WESTERN AGENDA FOR POPULATION CONTROL MAAAAN!""

What Chomsky posited with that theory is that basically, the media can't be un-biased based on a few key factors such as funding and want for profit, and owner bias. 

Now, part of that theory involves the representation of non-home states. That doesn't mean what you think it means. What you said a few comments back basically amounts to:

""HEY MAN, ALL WESTERN MEDIA IS PRO-WESTERN, AND MANIPULATED PEOPLE.""

That's not what Chomsky said. What Chomsky talks about is idealogical and national bias not only from the media sources (in the case of disreputable tabloids and other bad journalism) but from the audience, towards legitimate journalism. That means that Chomsky himself admits that there are professional pieces of journalism produced by good people in western countries. In fact, this accounts for most of it. 

Chomsky is not a barking wingnut, he's just a clever man who noticed a causal pattern and wrote about it. It should be obvious to anyone of intelligence that things like advertising and readership pandering affect media sources, in fact I'm pretty sure I said that a few comments ago. However, not all media sources are inherently biased on a nationalistic scale. The news they report can become biased by audience interpretation, but by definition the western media itself is no worse than western business, or western education, or western healthcare, or western policing, or western entertainment, or western culture, or western art, or western transportation, or any other conceptual system within western society. 

This is also based off the assumption that all nationalistic biases will be positive, which is un-true, as you can see via the many self-critical articles published by sources as varied as The Guardian and The Daily Mail.

Yet how many people here are suggesting we sell Adam, Downing and Henderson?? Andy Carroll was only on for the last 8 minutes yet he seems to get the most blame of all!

 &gt;The 4 players up front are isolated but fro full back assistance, it's easy to defend against. There's not enough invention, fluidity, movement, nous, anything!

Hmmm...sound familiar? This is the same exact problem we had last year under Ancelotti who used completely different tactics from AVB, and it was even the same training and tactics that won us the double.

Our primary problems to me are this...in this order

1. No link between midfield and forwards, not enough dribbling and incisive passing coming from our midfield. We actually do see this sometimes but it comes about 1/3, 1/4 games. It not that its not being taught or practiced, the execution has been poor and this has pretty much coincided with a large dip in form from the performance of Lampard, as well as the failure to replace Deco and Ballack. 
 
2. Lack of a striker who can regularly score goals. We haven't had one in over a year. Drogba can do it, once again ever 1 out 4 games or so, but that is not enough. we have literally tried EVERYTHING with Torres. He must be cursed. I agree that we should give Lukaku a shot. I don't think that he would change everything overnight but I would rather watch someone with heart who is going to improve over time. We could move Sturridge over but this leads us to our next problem....

3. Lack of squad depth/lack of wingers. We don't really have enough talent, energy, or proper depth in many positions to be challenging right now. We basically don't have any preferred position wingers besides Malouda....and I mean c'mon. We signed 1 first team ready player for this season, 2 squad players, and some youth. after a handful of players left, and many of our core players are clearly on the decline. Look at today for example...60th minute mark and we look lethargic and need an injection of energy some spark. Then look at the bench. Not a single attractive option. Over the course of a season this is what separates the 4th-7th place pack from 1-3. 

I'm not arguing AVB is flawless, but I really don't see how we wouldn't be doing much much much better with a real squad overhaul.

* Kenny: Although this season is a huge disappointment he was hired to build for the future; give him time. I will certainly reevaluate this statement next season, but I still have my faith in Dalglish.

* Henderson/Carroll: These players were bought as investments for the future and although they haven't exactly been stellar this year, they certainly have shown flashes of potential. It's been said time and time again, but they are young and could easily develop into serious threats in the future. I'll beat the dead horse even further by mentioning Lucas and how he developed into such an impressive player over time. As much as it's easy to point fingers at them now, I will give the young players a few years to develop. 

* Adam/Downing: Whereas Hendo and Carroll were bought with the future in mind, Adam and Downing were not. They both had successful campaigns last year with their previous clubs and they were bought to bring more immediate success to LFC. This hasn't happened and therefore I think they should shoulder some (but by no means all) of the blame.

I'm really not sure what to make of this year; on paper we are a strong side. I would blame the lack of chemistry but we're two-thirds into the season and it should have developed by now. I'm not really exactly sure what this club needs at the moment but I think the first step towards fixing the problems we have is finishing the season strong.

&gt; Liverpool's SECOND STRING midfield dominated a much vaunted opposition

That ""second string"" midfield cost a shit tonne of money and has played more than this fabled first string midfield you are alluding to. Would Gerrard have made a difference today? Considering we haven't won a league game that he played in this season, I think that is rather optimistic.

&gt; Yet how many people here are suggesting we sell Adam, Downing and Henderson?? Andy Carroll was only on for the last 8 minutes yet he seems to get the most blame of all!

Henderson is young, and maybe one day will become great, but he's simply not there yet for a team that is aiming to make 4th **this season.** Downing has 0 league goals and 0 assists. Not fucking good enough, no matter what the excuse is. We brought him here to be a creator and he has failed. Yes, our finishing hasn't flattered him any, but unless it's against a Championship side, he's been disappointing. 

&gt; We need 1 goalscorer. 1 person to put the ball in the back of the net more than 20 times in course of the season.

Suarez put the ball in the net 50 times his last year at Ajax. Fifty. But he is carrying this team, creatively. He can't do it all. Not one of these players today showed any guts.

&gt; Selling off young players who are largely backups, covering for older players is idiocy.

Who are referring to? Adam and Downing are **not** young. Carroll was never intended to be a backup, neither was Henderson. 

I'd love to vaunt Gerrard to the position he seems to occupy in your mind, but the time for his replacement is NOW. He hasn't performed at an above average level consistently in two years. It would be foolish to overlook that.

&gt; And as for people suggesting Dalglish needs to go they need their heads examined IMHO.

If we do not finish higher than last season, considering the money and patience he has been given, I will be incredibly surprised (and disappointed) if he is kept at the club.",0,1330815323,null,0,false,0,c3xecor,t3_qfxdy,t1_c3xecor,t1_c3xd0ft,null,1428462387,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

I don't know if you only look at stats like assists, but Henderson has been pretty fantastic for a 21 year old in his first year with the club. 

Lucas might not improve the finishing but he would certainly help the hoofing, and would provide the time and balls Suarez needs. Lucas is fantastic at keeping the ball, finding the right pass, and winning it back immediately if necessary. If you can't see why replacing Lucas with Adam generates more hoofs then I'm afraid there's nothing to be done.

Catherine Tate is outstanding. Those finale episodes remain some of my favorites still. So well written but it just ties things together so perfectly, the cameos, the callbacks to previous plots. Really cemented my love for the series.

The second string midfield you're so upset with played rings around Arsenal today. These players you seem to despise created opportunity after opportunity. We should have been 5 up at half time.

Adam and Downing played well today, it was one of Liverpool's best performances of the season. Seriously. I'm quoting Alan Hansen there, and he's right. Pace, tempo, movement, it was all there. All that was missing was someone to put the ball in the back of the net. To blame today's loss on someone like Adam is mystifying.

Perhaps Suarez needs support to become a 49 goals a season man. If that's the case we should go out and buy that player. From what I've seen of him in the PL I think he's so creative he'd be the perfect partner for a instinctive finisher (a Fowler type player). He's half of a partnership.

Maybe you're arguing that Suarez is so busy creating he can't get opportunities to score? Well he did have a create a few opportunities to score and didn't convert.

""Carroll was never intended to be a backup, neither was Henderson.""
Actually yes they were. Theyr'e 23 and 22 respectively, they won't be at their peak for another 3-4 years. Dalglish specifically said  [Carroll was bought for 5 and a 1/2 years](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqqBYEJNOZM&amp;feature=player_embedded). I think it's fairly apparent Carroll shouldn't be expected to score 30 goals a season at the moment, I think he'd be ideal as a tactical alternative &amp; a backup for another year or two. But the idea of selling two players of huge potential because they're not setting the premiership alight at age 22 is crazy. Chucking the baby out with the bathwater.

The reason we lost today was because Van Persie got 2 chances and scored two goals. We don't have a player like that. If we did, we'd have won. And we'd have won AT A CANTER. 

Finally, I find your demands to change the manager pretty repulsive. IT'S SIX DAYS SINCE WE WON OUR FIRST PIECE OF SILVERWARE IN 6 YEARS! Dalglish WAS the reason we finished as high as we did last season (don't you remember??) and you can see a clear progression in performances since he took over.

Ok, so does that mean the Trickster/Time Beetle create a new parallel universe from #1 Original Donna (from her energy?) that previously had not existed -- by splitting that point into a forked path of 2 universes?

---I think that the Time Beetle created the parallel universe, going by the doctors explination that it normally only altered life in small ways, but because of what Donna has done, it created a giant parallel universe by changing that small thing it removed Donna from meeting the Doctor. I thought that the parallel universe became the main one.


Is this a real alt universe? Or is it all happening in the Fortune Teller's booth, or inside the Time Beetle (like a miniature world trapped in a snow globe)? Basically creating a type of food source (time? energy?) for itself.

---I think it is a real alt universe, and that it isn't in the booth or a snow globe situation. It took interference from an outside source that wasn't affected (Rose) to fix it, rather than the doctor appearing and saving her, if it was a snow globe situation he would have wandered in and stopped it. I would think that because he doesn't exist in the new reality, he cannot come and save donna because he never met her.

If it's a real universe/alt timeline, then how do we have so much time passing there (what looks like 1-2 years), yet only a few minutes passing with #1 Original Donna in the Fortune Teller booth? How do these 2 timelines or universes reconcile?

---Because Donna made herself turn left, she basically cancelled out the alternative universe. It never happened because she met the doctor, this removed the alt universe completely. This meant she was back in the booth a few seconds after the time beetle attatched itself to her, so in that reality only a short space of time passed. I would assume that Rose knows what happened because she was there and outside of the influence because she moved back and forth in the different realities.

Questions about the Time Beettle

I'm very confused on the whole Time Beetle thing. It just leaves me with a ""wait… what?"" conclusion whenever I try to figure it out.

The way it's attached to Donna's back suggests some kind of parasite. Do the Time Beetles eat time? What is their purpose in relation to the Trickters?

---The doctor said something along the line of they live on the energy of lives being altered, people never met etc, so it is feeding on her through changing her life and the events surrounding it. I don't know anything about the Trickster brigade, havn't seen those episodes.

Why can't most people, including #2 Beetle Donna and her family, see the Time Beetle? Is this some sort of Trickster magic or reality cloaking? I couldn't find an explanation of how the Trickster and Time Beetle work together.

---I think it would be some kind of perception filter, or that it is a case that only certain people can see it, low grade psychics and all that, like Gwenyth (SP?) in the episode with Dickens, she could see where Rose came from. I'm basing this on Donnas friend who apparently already claimed to have seen a ghost/said somewhere is haunted and was able to see that there was something there (evalyna (sp?) was also psychic and said the same).

On a practical issue, how the hell does the whole Time Beetle thing physically play out, being attached to her back and all? I mean, she has this thing on her back, so where does it go when she changes clothes?

...Does it crawl off when she removes a shirt or coat, then crawl back on? Like, in one scene we see Donna with no coat and she has the Time Beetle on her back (outside her shirt). Then in another scene she does have a coat and the Time Beetle is on the outside of her coat. Was this just an awkward solution by the writers, because viewers wouldn't be able to see the Time Beetle if it crawled underneath and connected directly to her skin? The mechanics of this make the whole premise confusing for me.

------I assume it is out of phase with that reality, so her clothes move through it and hence why she can't see it/feel it on her and only some people notice, otherwise everyone would see this whopping beetle on her all the time. 

Questions about Rose

Why didn't Rose just directly cause #3 Driving Donna to turn left, or at least interact with her directly instead of the convoluted interactions with #2 Beetle Donna?

---She said getting to different realities was difficult and that the wrong word to the wrong person could end things, perhaps having Donna go back and do something was less dangerous, plus you are less likely to believe some random psychotic blonde banging on your window screaming ""NO! NO! turn LEFT! LEFT!"" than if you ran up to yourself, plus as we saw by the ending alternate Donna died, so perhaps that was the only way to stop it, and Rose knew that was always going to happen and thus she had to let it occur. OR it could be that Rose already missed that time and over shot it, so maybe she couldn't travel through time as well and that through Donna going back in time, Rose was able to follow.
Simple answer, if she did that the episode wouldn't have happened. If you apply that logic to any TV show/book it can fall apart. Especially Doctor Who. Why did they explore that instead of just leaving? Why didn't the Doctor check what was happening in the local history? Why doesn't he go back in time and warn people of the incoming disaster or in the case of the end of season 1, why didn't he leave, go back in time, figure out a solution in his own sweet time then go back? He wouldn't have crossed his own time stream and would have returned a few moments later (to everyone else). wibbily wobbily, timey wimey.


Questions about Donna

How did we get two Donnas existing in the same universe (#2 Beetle Donna and #3 Driving Donna)? How did #2 Beetle Donna get into that universe in the first place, if it was already occupied with an existing Donna (#3)? ETA: Or, wait, was #3 Driving Donna in (1) an earlier version of #1 Original Donna's universe [Rose sent Donna into a separate universe AND in a different time]; or (2) simply an earlier time in the same universe [#2 Beetle Donna's]?

---Donna went back in time, so that's how she was in the same universe as Driving Donna, it is an earlier time in beetle Donna's own timeline who is the same as Driving Donna, Driving Donna esentially becomes beetle Donna. Like in fathers day, there are two Roses in the same timeline. 

Also, because I don't understand how these universes are created and how they interact, I don't understand how Donna is ""the most important woman in the whole of creation."" Though this article made me notice there are some parallels to Planet of the Spiders with Sarah Jane. I assume the similarities are purposeful on the part of the writers?

---If Donna never met the Doctor, then all these bad things would have happened, plus any future bad events that he isn't around to stop, all of those working to protect earth have died at this point, therefor she is the most important women in the whole of creation because she keeps the doctor alive. By saving the Doctor, Donna saves billions, perhaps trillions of people along with the universe and any other civilisations/peoples the doctor will go on to save or missed out saving with Martha/Donna.

If the companions were more passive and deferential to The Doctor, always waiting for permission to run off, I think viewers would complain that the companions were useless. Particularly because the companion role serves the purpose of giving the viewer someone to identify with (The Doctor being alien and all).

As I see it the companions and The Doctor are a team; he's not their boss, he's their partner.

The aim of the AMA was to highlight the difficulties involving excessive red tape in the NHS that Nurses and doctors have to deal with on a daily basis. The AMA is not to argue a point, but rather hear of the experiences of someone who deals with these issues first hand, and feels that reform, at least of some kind is urgently necessary.

The nurse (provably) works for a small general practice in a small town in England. they have worked in London and another city in the past. they also (meanwhile) are an NHS nurse and do not treat private health care patients.

They are not affiliated with any company other than the NHS and the aforementioned practice she works for.

Suarez scored 22 in his first season for Ajax, 28 the next season, then 48 the season after that. I think players playing close to their peaks need a year or 2 to settle into any team and become a top goal scorer. A by bringing in a load of new midfielders and new forwards I think it was wishful thinking to expect us to be smashing goals in week in week out. Dagger/Skrtel have been at Anfield for a while so they've been solid, they know what to expect from each other. They know where the other will be covering, what they're thinking so they work well as a team.

Henderson/Downing/Adam/Gerrard with Suarez/Carroll have been together for just over half a season so give them another year and they'll know exactly what the others are thinking, they'll work well and bang them in.

Maybe consider bringing in one or 2 new faces in the summer for the long term but I think in 3 or 4 years time the Carroll/Henderson/Lucas/Spearing partnership could be the top scoring in the league if they all stay at LFC.",0,1330826538,null,0,false,0,c3xfytw,t3_qgj6w,t1_c3xfytw,t3_qgj6w,null,1428463145,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Why? That is seriously worrying in a discussion that is relevant to the future of Health and Social care in our country! That does indicate that something is worthy of being hidden, and again I repeat that she is not a whistleblower on malpractice (and would have avenues to go down were this the case), but is merely proposing a case for the bill. Others in her profession have been on, e.g., Newsnight, and made similar claims. 

Edit: Why is it not happening now? Why are such questions seemingly too awkward? You previously stated that the nurse works for a private practice. No mention was made of being an NHS nurse? How is this or the private practice they work for not relevant to this discussion?

This is also does not acknowledge one of the earlier points I had brought up that the majority of Health workers want some reform, but not this reform, including the Royal Society of Nurses. Using you as a proxy is a very weak way of getting her message out their when full disclosure would add more credence to her, and again, to prove she actually exists!

I'm kinda guessing I have a bit of a clue, yes.

&gt;Have you even read Chomsky beyond an interpreted article on Wikipedia?

No, that's right, I've been an anarchist for nigh on 30 years, and I've never even picked up a single book by Chomsky - a ""fellow traveller"".  It somehow didn't seem relevant.

&gt;You're talking bullshit.

I beg to differ, I'm not the one who been casting aspersions on sanity whilst creating a fantasy world of strawman positions for my opponent.  In this thread you've been the very embodiment of bullshit, and there's plenty in evidence above, you even helpfully capitalised some of it.

&gt;What Chomsky posited with that theory is that basically, the media can't be un-biased based on a few key factors such as funding and want for profit, and owner bias.

Yes, and...?

&gt;Chomsky never said:

&gt;""HEY MAAAAN, THE GOVERNMENT IS MANIPULATING THE MEDIA AND ITS A WESTERN AGENDA FOR POPULATION CONTROL MAAAAN!""

&gt;What Chomsky posited with that theory is that basically, the media can't be un-biased based on a few key factors such as funding and want for profit, and owner bias.

&gt;Now, part of that theory involves the representation of non-home states. That doesn't mean what you think it means.

It means (mainstream) Western media news output is pro corporate and filtered, which amounts to much the same thing.  The interests of Western States and Western corporations are highly identified.

&gt;What you said a few comments back basically amounts to:

&gt;""HEY MAN, ALL WESTERN MEDIA IS PRO-WESTERN, AND MANIPULATED PEOPLE.""

Oooh, another strawman.  What I actually said was ""RT is really no more biased against the West than Western media is pro West...It's sometimes inaccurate, but more often it's merely selective and accentuates or de-emphasises issues to provide spin- which is exactly how Western media operates.""  And which, incidentally, is pretty much what Chomsky says...

&gt;What Chomsky talks about is idealogical and national bias not only from the media sources (in the case of disreputable tabloids and other bad journalism) but from the audience, towards legitimate journalism.

This is a total misrepresentation of Chomsky.  He's not talking about ""bad"" papers and TV outlets and ""bad"" journalists, he's talking about how corporate (aka almost the entire) media works.  This is clear when he says things like it wouldn't matter if all the journalists who worked in the Western media were members of the Socialist Workers Party, the news output could, and most likely would, remain corporate propaganda - it's not the views or indeed the integrity of individual journalists which matters, it's the corporate media system and the propaganda model which underpins it.  The filters remain in place.

Additionally, his model is nothing to do with audiences demanding a product which conforms to and confirms their own world view, quite the contrary, he sees the corporate media business model as selling relatively privileged audiences to their advertisers (other large transnational corporations).  Both points are made very clearly in [his interview with Andrew Marr of the Beeb](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu1ONVg362o).  This one includes the classic peonage of the idea of the crusading journalist championing free speech - ""I'm sure you believe everything you say, if you didn't believe it, you wouldn't be sitting here"".

&gt;That means that Chomsky himself admits that there are professional pieces of journalism produced by good people in western countries. In fact, this accounts for most of it. 

Nope.  He certainly acknowledges there are good journalists,but again, listen to that piece above - he notes that the better journalists (which constitute, to paraphrase his words, a small minority who weren't raised to be obedient) are far more cynical about the media than he is, and need to act very cleverly to slip important truths into their copy.  They hide themselves and these truths in unlikely places to give them a chance to see the light of day.

&gt;The news they report can become biased by audience interpretation, 

Really?  It's ""audience interpretation"" which makes them biased?  Really?! Did you just say that?

&gt;but by definition the western media itself is no worse than western business, or western education, or western healthcare, or western policing, or western entertainment, or western culture, or western art, or western transportation, or any other conceptual system within western society. 

Well, corporate capitalism pervades the West and most parts of the globe these days.  That doesn't mean there's nothing good about the West or the world, of course, but it does mean much is presented through a particular lens.  To take but one example, have you critically analysed much of the output of Hollywood, and the US (indeed the UK) entertainments industry recently?  I mean, if you can't see the propaganda value in 24, Person of Interest, NCIS, Spooks, CSI, Battlestar Galactica and the rest, I really take my hat off to you.

[You need to listen to him in his own words](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUGr5rZSWPo).

The Doctor runs into the control room in his swimming costume, drying his hair with a towel, almost slipping on the shiny floor and catching himself by grabbing the console.  The alarms are going off - he's confused, saying ""What?"" a lot.  He takes his hand off one of the control elements, and it comes away covered in green.  He looks at it in bewilderment for a second, before being thrown backwards out of shot as the TARDIS crashes into something outside.  It goes rather quiet.

Cut to an open [moon pool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_pool) in a near-future human science research base.  An elderly scientist has pulled their SCUBA hood back, hanging on to the edge of the pool, talking to a younger assistant in accessorized utilitarian clothing.

The elderly scientist says:  *""I'll never understand the cynicism of youth, you know - there are things down here that people couldn't have imagined only a few years ago.""*

The younger replies:  *""That was years ago, like you said - turn of the century stuff.""*

Elderly:  *""I tell you - there's something beyond your wildest dreams down there.""*

Sudden bubbling and violent roiling from the pool behind the scientist.  Strange lights, splashes - it all seems very violent.  The lights in the moon pool room flicker and die. The scientists are unnerved!  The assistant is scared, the elder is curious and excited!

The pool BURSTS as the TARDIS breaks the surface, bobbing, dripping with water and underlit.  The lights flicker back on.

The TARDIS rotates, revealing the Doctor, still in his swimming costume, clutching on to the edge like a piece of flotsam, spitting out a mouthful of water.  The scientists are gobsmacked.

He quips: ""I couldn't have a sandwich, could I?  I'm always starving after a swim.""

Cue intro!  [Wooooeeeeeooooooooooo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G8G0P__dwI).

Synopsis - It's set in and around the ocean-floor research base on near-future Earth.  Things are breaking down and the whole base is being plagued by a virulent green algae that gets into everything.  (Think abrasive moon regolith, or sand at the beach.)  Even the TARDIS exterior is coated with the stuff in a matter of minutes!  (This clogs the door and prevents escape.)

The 'pet' giant squid of the scientists (they call him Bob) is behaving erratically, and when the base's communication goes down, and the scientists launch a floating message pod to send for help, Bob brings it back, crushed and covered in the algae.

Things continue to fail.  One of the scientists gets increasingly suspicious of this mysterious stranger (the Doctor) and tries turning the rest of the scientists against him.  It all comes to a head when the power to the base is failing, and the elderly scientist and the Doctor are locked in the moon pool as the suspicious scientist is about to flood the area to save on power and save the rest of them.

The lights fail, just as the pumps slow (and the water starts overflowing the moon pool) and the room is bathed in eerie, beautiful, bioluminescent light from the green algae.  It traces patterns and symbols across the surfaces of the room - even over the TARDIS itself.  The elderly scientist rushes from symbol to symbol, trying to understand them, as the Doctor begs the other scientists to open the doors and restart the pumps - if only they'd look at the algae!!

The pumps fail, just as the scientist comes to a realization, and Bob the giant squid surfaces at the pool - his tentacles reaching for the pair.  The elderly scientist tells the Doctor the algae is trying to communicate with them, and the Doctor grabs the scientist - tells him to trust him, and they leap into the water with Bob.

They emerge in an underwater chamber.  The Doctor does one of his ""Of course!"" speeches about algae creating oxygen, oldest lifeform on the planet, etc.  It's been trying to communicate with them through Bob - not trying to hurt the humans at all!  It's a race to communicate with the algae and Bob, and save the rest of the scientists from their own narrow-mindedness.  Of course the Doctor does so with aplomb.

Kenny is creating a team for the future and is doing it well. In a few years Gerrard will be gone, so will Carragher and a few others. this Liverpool team s being changed weekly and that is one of the reasons for our inconsistency, but Kenny is doing it on purpose. He is getting all the players to know each other and doing it in a way that everyone gets a run as well. My concern is when Lucas gets back he might have too many in the center of midfield to play, but that is few and far between. 

Today we lost, I expected 1 of two teams to show up today, the good one and the bad one. The good one showed and really it is just a blend that is not clicking and a lot of bad luck. Carragher is my fault for both goals, with blame on Skrtel for the first and Reina for the second also. With a guy like Van Persie I don't care how you defend, as long as you defend him. he is one of the best strikers in the world and you have no one marking him for both goals? it is hard to fathom really. 

the main thing is we are creating chances. Adam is a little off touch (personally not just his corners but all our free kicks and corners are starting to irritate me. It is not really that difficult to get the ball into the penalty spot, but we just keep wasting them. 13 corners and no opportunities is just too much for me). Downing is off touch but has improved a lot in the past few games. Suarez I can only say 1 thing about, stop over exaggerating, it is the main thing that pisses me off about any footballer. 

on Henderson I can say this, whoever is saying that he is crap and a waste is an idiot and blind. Enrique is the best signing we have had, but that is short term right now, Henderson is going to become a fantastic player. he is our best signing thinking on long term. He is great and is still young, so he can improve and stay with us for longer. He is someone who will be watched by many in the coming years.

Shelvey - Could have seen him come on for Adam, but given his inexperience I can understand not changing things. Again, not sure about his defensive qualities.

Bellamy - Downing had a good game and provides width on the left flank, from where Bellamy tends to cut inside. Henderson, while poor on the ball for parts, was good defensively - see point about pressing earlier.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans along. We've had approximately 780 episodes but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in anywhere.
The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a person will like.

Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 then relaunched in 2005. By no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv). You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

And even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor. The ninth only has one series with some questionable writing, but he's a fantastic Doctor as well, and shines when given the chance. No matter what you do, watch all six series. And if you like them, there's always classic who... :D

The Ark in Space (his second story, but really the first one of his era as his debut was more in the Pertwee style)

Genesis of the Daleks (reveals Dalek origin &amp; introduces Davros - v dark)

The Seeds of Doom (quite gritty but with his quirky sense of humour)

The Deadly Assassin (first proper look at Gallifrey - freaky 3rd episode)

The Robots of Death (spooky murder mystery with art-deco killer robots)

City of Death (set and partly filmed on location in Paris. Looks classy, witty Douglas Adams dialogue)

Baker is always watchable, though over 7 years there are big changes in tone depending on the producer &amp; script editor (first 3 seasons dark and gothic with stories inspired by classic horror books &amp; movies; years 4-6 fun but more frivolous humour plus budgets heavily cut due to recession; year 7 glossier look and more serious scientific basis and doomladen Doctor)",0,1330852500,null,0,false,0,c3xj9v5,t3_qguxz,t1_c3xj9v5,t3_qguxz,null,1428464720,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Scumbag Catholic Church. Insists that all priests remain celibate; believes that makes it an expert on marriage.

Seriously though, it's this section that shows just how out of touch they are:

&gt;He said the idea of redefining marriage… would ""shame the United Kingdom in the eyes of the world"".

No it wouldn't, at least nowhere near as much as sheltering and apologising for child rapists has shamed the Roman Catholic Church in the eyes of the world. For the vast majority of people in the UK it's a complete non-issue. There are much more important things to be worrying about than whether gay couples can get married in Church- the Conservative Party is seeing to that with its austerity measures. As far as the rest of the world goes, it hasn't brought shame to any of the other countries which have already introduced similar legislation so I don't see why that should uniquely be the case with the UK.  

&gt;""Same-sex marriage would eliminate entirely in law the basic idea of a mother and a father for every child. It would create a society which deliberately chooses to deprive a child of either a mother or a father.""

I'm not entirely sure what he means by this. Is he proposing that gay people should be forced into heterosexual relationships in order to procreate? That used to happen when there was more of a taboo about being gay. It caused a great deal of unhappiness for a large number of gay people as well as their (straight) spouses who were living in sham marriages.  
That's the only possible interpretation I can think of. I'd love to see how his logic works on this.

&gt;He accuses ministers of attempting to ""redefine reality"", and ""dismantle the universally understood meaning of marriage"".

Says a man who believes that bread and wine turns into flesh and blood through the simple use of an incantation- because redefining reality to suit yourself is the Church's job.  
Again I don't get what he means by ""dismantling."" To the best of my knowledge there's no proposed ban on heterosexual marriage which will continue exactly as before and be completely unaffected by the proposed changes.

&gt;Cardinal O'Brien claimed the change was ""at the behest of a small minority of activists"". 

As is usually the case with anything. The most vocal voices belong to those people who are affected directly, with the vast majority of the general population being completely apathetic about any issue. The Cardinal seems to misinterpret a lack of activism on behalf of an issue for opposition to it.

&gt;Cardinal Keith O'Brien, the leader of the Catholic Church in Scotland, said the plans were a ""grotesque subversion of a **universally accepted human right"".**

Irony much?

Perhaps the Cardinal might do well to read some history, particularly that of another long-abused minority in the UK whose struggle for acceptance and rights is [well documented.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Emancipation)",0,1330853092,null,0,false,0,c3xjbm3,t3_qguic,t1_c3xjbm3,t3_qguic,null,1428464732,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18

So, the answer is ""Mouse"", and everyone's confused for a while by that.  But, in the reveal episode, (written by Neil Gaiman, obviously) we learn that not only is the Doctor the last time lord, he was also the first.  He was made (for lack of a better word) by mixing human DNA with mouse DNA (the mice from Hitchhiker's Guide).  He still had parents that raised him and all, but time went all timey wimey (like it does) and he ended up getting raised by his decedents (the rest of the Gallifreyans all being his decendents).  

Somewhere in there, Jenny gets mixed in...and Jack as well.

The Ugandan-born dad-of-three has amassed an estimated £42million fortune as founder and chief of TLC Group, which provides services for the elderly. Mr Cameron made the businessman a peer shortly after entering No10 last May, and Lord Popat’s donations include a £25,000 gift registered a week after the Tories’ health reforms were unveiled last July.

From the Andrew Lansley section there is, amongst others

&gt;Andrew Lansley’s wife, Sally Low, is founder and managing director of Low Associates (“We make the link between the public and private sectors”). A Daily Telegraph report in February records that the Low Associates website lists pharmaceuticals companies SmithKline Beecham, Unilever and P&amp;G among its clients. It also records Ms Low’s assertion that the company “does not work with any client who has interests in the health sector”. The website currently contains no reference to the drug firms listed above. http://www.channel4.com/news/andrew-lansleys-nhs-plans-still-in-good-health

&gt;Circle the ambitious private healthcare firm run and owned by clinicians, has recruited a former aide to health secretary Andrew Lansley as head of communications. Christina Lineen spent two years working for Lansley, who became health secretary after the general election. The company’s income is derived from private patients, either on insurance schemes or paying for themselves, but it also treats NHS patients.

and there's also this relating to the Liberal Democrat party

&gt;Liberal Democrats - Alpha Healthcare, a residential homes firm which gave the Liberal Democrats party £125,000 last year, is ultimately run by Harberry Investments in the British Virgin Islands. Alpha Healthcare, based in Redditch, Worcestershire, runs ten care homes across Britain and had a turnover in 2006 of £14.5 million. Alpha Healthcare’s ultimate parent company is Harberry Investments, which is based in Tropic Isle Building on the island of Tortola.

&gt; On 1 January 1983, upon the coming into force of the British Nationality Act 1981, every Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies became either a British Citizen, British Dependent Territories Citizen or British Overseas Citizen.

&gt; The use of the term ""British subject"" was discontinued for all persons who fell into these categories, or who had a national citizenship of any other part of the Commonwealth. The category of ""British subjects"" now includes only those people formerly known as ""British subjects without citizenship"", and no other. In statutes passed before 1 January 1983, however, references to ""British subjects"" continue to be read as if they referred to ""Commonwealth citizens"".

&gt; British Citizens are not British Subjects under the 1981 Act. The only circumstance where a person may be both a British Subject and British citizen simultaneously is a case where a British Subject connected with Ireland (s. 31 of the 1981 Act) acquires British citizenship by naturalisation or registration. In this case only, British Subject status is not lost upon acquiring British citizenship.
The status of British Subject cannot now be transmitted by descent, and will become extinct when all existing British Subjects are dead.

&gt; British Subjects, other than by those who obtained their status by virtue of a connection to the Republic of Ireland prior to 1949, automatically lose their British Subject status on acquiring any other nationality, including British citizenship, under section 35 of the British Nationality Act 1981.

true,SouthPads,cnty-england,England,"&gt;May I point out that faith schools are allowed to select pupils.

So can every school? That's why it's difficult to get badly behaved kids into schools, particularly if they have been expelled several times. Faith schools have to take from the local population same as any school. However, in SOME faith schools, there are a number of guaranteed places for religious kids.

&gt;That, in and of it's own, mean that they can remove the children likely to perform poorly.

There is no evidence that this is an existing trend, or has even happened at all. Also, it is illegal to expel a child from any British school without good reasoning. I know this because my eldest brother, John, was essentially bullied by two of his teachers, to the point where one of them wrote us a letter home saying basically ""don't bother coming back after half term"". My Dad took them up before the board of education and they nearly lost their jobs. It is *highly* illegal. That school was a State Grammar School in Lincolnshire.

&gt;The second effect is that, when competition for places is tight, the parents do all sorts of hoop jumping to get their kids in. That indicates to the pupil that the parents believe that school is important - and that is a factor that has been found to universally correlate with pupil outcomes.

Quite right, but this isn't exclusive to faith schools, it's exclusive to all good schools.

Very much so. I saw this headline yesterday and immediately said ""Bullshit"" out loud. The number of non-believers *already* out numbers Christians. The British Social Attitudes survey found in [Dec last year that 50% of people](http://blog.newhumanist.org.uk/2011/12/half-of-britons-now-non-religious-finds.html) responding have or belong to ""no religion"". Compare that to the Richard Dawkins Foundation [Ipsos MORI poll conducted 2 weeks after the census](http://richarddawkins.net/articles/644941-rdfrs-uk-ipsos-mori-poll-1-how-religious-are-uk-christians) - that found ~52% say they're Christian.

Then consider the 2nd part of that poll which asked people who call themselves Christians on the census [what they *actually* believe](http://richarddawkins.net/articles/644942-rdfrs-uk-ipsos-mori-poll-2-uk-christians-oppose-special-influence-for-religion-in-public-policy), and you find that they are (as you note) culturally Christian rather than religious.

Even if Christianity *is* followed by 54% of people, other religions in the UK are followed by more than 4% (just) of people, putting non-religious in the majority that way too (just!)!

So the extrapolation by the Daily Fail is crap and ignoring most of the available data.

No.  Local authorities have a duty to provide education to all.  Individual schools can exclude pupils, but they have to be extreme cases - and even then, some people just get serially repeatedly excluded round all the schools.

However, I'm not really talking about those few disruptive elements (although they can make a difference). I'm talking about the bottom 10 to 20 % of children - not disruptive, just never going to do as well at school.

Faith schools, for example, are not bound to a catchment area, for example.

&gt; There is no evidence that this is an existing trend, or has even happened at all.

I can point out that faith schools get to be selective, and on average do better.  I call that evidence (but not proof).

**&lt;TL;DR&gt; I honestly believed AVB was the manager to take this club into the future. Reasons/opinions below.**

Mou inherited Ranieri's star-studded squad, full of big signings and Roman's blank cheque which he used to bring in Drogba, Essien, Tiago, Mateja Kezman, Carvalho &amp; Ferreira for a total of 70 mn. Remember this was in addition to Cech, Lamps, Robben, Gallas, Joe Cole, Veron, Makelele, Crespo, Duff and the home-grown Terry. The new Russian money had made Chelsea a lucrative option for star-players - much like Anzhi &amp; City are at this moment. Moreover, he also did NOT have to worry about FFP and the likes. In other words, Mou had it (relatively) easy back then. 

Even after Mou's departure, the squad had a 66.67 win percentage with a 100% home record under Avram Grant - a manager about whom nothing more need be said. 

The spine of the current squad - Cech, Terry, Lamps, Cole, (now) Essien and Drogs is still Mou's squad. The average age of this spine is in the early-30s. Every manager who came in after Mou brought in players who could adapt to this spine and work with it.

And then, Roman went and brought in Torres.

Suddenly, the focus shifted from the spine to this new player who had to be 'accommodated'. An immediate analogy that suggests itself is that of an organ transplant gone horribly wrong. The body rejects it and the results are usually fatal - which is what seems to have happened here as well.

AVB tried to delay the inevitable by transplanting a bridge of sorts (Mata, Romeu,) and trying to stimulate the 'stem cells' (Lukaku, Piazon, Davila, Bamford, etc.) into injecting a fresh breath of life while trying to infuse it with a new spirit (a quick passing 4-3-3 with a high defensive line) at the same time. Whether it was too much at the same time or too little, we will never know but we do know now that it did not work.

Would AVB ultimately be the manager to lead Chelsea to glory and trophies? Honestly, I don't know and I can't say either with any emphasis because my knowledge of football is merely empirical rather than professional. 

I can, however, say this with full conviction: If the 'spine' makes the body rejects new organs, then it might just be a good idea to replace the spine itself. Or maybe, give up on the body entirely and build a completely new Frankenstein.

The kicker? AVB was head scout under Mou and he was *probably* the guy who recommended some of these players to him in the first place...",0,1330875621,null,0,false,0,c3xkx2i,t3_qh559,t1_c3xkx2i,t3_qh559,null,1428465481,39,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,39

true,SouthPads,cnty-england,England,"&gt;No. Local authorities have a duty to provide education to all. Individual schools can exclude pupils, but they have to be extreme cases - and even then, some people just get serially repeatedly excluded round all the schools.

This includes Faith Schools. If a child has no other school to go to, and the faiths school is the nearest one, they are bound by law to take on that child, regardless of creed or culture.

&gt;Faith schools, for example, are not bound to a catchment area, for example.

This differs from school to school, but most catholic schools I happen to know, do have catchment areas. Can't comment on other faiths.

&gt;I can point out that faith schools get to be selective, and on average do better. I call that evidence (but not proof).

Faith schools are semi-selective, and then only of a religious group. e.g. Our local Catholic school has many Philippine and Irish Gypsy families. This has nothing to do with socio economic class. Secondly, the Catholic demographic only makes up a proportion of the school (usually 60-70%) with the remaining children being secular or of other faiths.

Religion is not based on socio-economics. Anybody can be Catholic, or Muslim, or Hindu or what have you. Lastly, if these schools were not here, nothing would be fairer, we'd just have less schools that are shown to work and get good results.

&gt;I'm not talking expulsion - I'm talking never letting them in in the first place.

Without good reason, this too is illegal.

Here....

&gt;I don't think the Catholic church is in a position to talk about shame or same sex marriage.

Cardinal Keith O'Brien is not the catholic church. He is a member of it, just as Menzies Campbell is a member of the Lib Dems. His opinions on matters do not necessarily reflect the other Lib Dems, and neither do Cardinal Keith O'Brien's represent the rest of the Church. 

A member of the catholic church has as much right to express his/her opinions as anyone else, no matter whether some people in the organisation have been guilty of such crimes.

You are generalising by putting all members of the Catholic Church under this one umbrella that they accept, cover up or condone the actions of a notorious minority. 

Unless this man has been found guilty of something along these lines, then why would the awful choices of other people have any impact on this man's beliefs and ideals?

And you were the one who brought 'gay' into this.

&gt;But hey, if all you're concerned with are people potentially making generalisations, then good on you.

No, I'm just concerned when people act high-and-mighty towards institutions like the catholic church for being old and out dated, when they act in similar fashion. Instead of using logic and sense (as we should in a civilised world) in an argument, they attack people.

By all means criticise his opinions, but don't make it personal and then assume that everyone in the Catholic church is the same.

And just going back a second...

&gt;The church needs to shut up and get out of politics.

Why? Politics affects them as much as it affects you and me. Should business stay out of politics too? If we allow some groups to have a say, but not others, where does that put us?

&gt;Faith Schools: Admissions and Performance – A Report by the House of Commons Library (2009)
 
&gt;A review of the current evidence on the relationship between admissions and performance in faith 
schools.
&gt;“**Recent research on primary schools suggests that performance difference can largely be explained by 
prior attainment and background. The remaining differences are due to parental self-selection and 
selection methods used by some faith schools.**  
Further analysis of GCSE results shows a different pattern of results for faith and non-faith schools with 
similar governance arrangements and control over admissions. Non-faith schools perform better in 
certain categories, faith schools do best in others and there is no clear difference in some.”

So you have a more informed opinion and so that you might see what point I'm making? Everyone might have an opinion, but some are based on data.

I was pointing you towards a poll that asked people who put ""Christian"" on the census campaign what they believe about aspects of Christianity. There are questions in there regarding Christian dogma/beliefs - what we've been talking about in the last few comments - such as ""Do you believe Jesus was the son of Jahweh"" and ""Do you believe that he rose from the dead.""

I don't think it's a reasonable response to say ""It depends what you mean by X"" when we're discussing what historically were claimed pre-requisites to being Christian - I don't think it's a terribly honest position.

During the Bolton game, one of the commentators mentioned he has no experience or skills with managing players. He might be tactically brilliant...but it's one aspect that's been lacking. Regardless of how you feel about Carlo, he seemed to have managed the Ego's considerably better (Coaching AC will give you that experience).

For a manager with underwhelming credentials, Chelsea was too much of a big step. I really dislike our incessant manager sacking, but I feel this was right. But to be honest...he shouldn't have been appointed in the first place, simply due to the overwhelming task at hand. 

Ideally, we should've hired someone to secure us CPL (One season manager), whilst bringing in AVB slowly to re-build. **This sacking means something very important**. If they sacked him mid-season without letting him rebuild, it's because they don't trust his judgement or with our money (referring to transfer money, not his payout).

Now to the term 'poisoned chalice'. I fucking hate that term, since Inter and other clubs also have very similar issues. There are some elements of that phrase that rings true, **and it's Abramovic's fault**. I'm referring to number 9, Torres.

That's a major problem to our cause. Abramovic spent a ludicrous amount on a broken and out of form player. Once again, I like Torre's charm, much like AVB...but talking level-headedly, it's a big disaster. Not only is every manager obligated to play him, but that 50mil takes a big chunk of our team-rebuilding budget (Not because we don't have enough, but due to financial fair play).

Every manager has to decide whether to build a team around a 50million dollar player that's under performing, or play him awkwardly as a target man.

The humanism one is good though. However, it isn't especially damning.

This is a break down of Religious people in the UK by socio-economic class:

&gt;“AB 
social class (34%) and owner occupiers without a mortgage (32%) among the groups overrepresented 
and “C2 social class (21%); DE social class (22%); single people (19%) and council tenants (19%)” 

This shows that the upper middle class is the highest with 34% religiosity. However, one can safely assume that the upper middle class sends their children to private school. so to look at owner occupiers without a mortgage (32%). There are not a vast amount greater numbers of middle class religious people than their are of the lowest group (19%) that's a difference of only 13%. This shows that whilst there may be a slight imbalance in socio-economic class, it isn't pronounced. 

On a slightly more controversial level, it also allows poorer kids (statistically more prone to failing in education) to receive the same level of education as some of the wealthier kids (statistically better behaved and higher achieving), which can only be benefitting the poorer kids. I think its great that socio-economic classes are mixed in this way, as it discourages elitism.

Finally, you're report concludes: ""Non-faith schools perform better in certain categories, faith schools do best in others and there is no clear difference in some.""

Microlights are pretty sensitive to thermals and wind and stuff, it can be a fairly bumpy ride. When I went up it took a lot of mental fortitude and a slight aerospace background to keep myself 'ok' in the thing, but when I was up there properly it was excellent.

Also good (mainly for watching, but Classic Wings have a DH Dragon Rapide aircraft there as well) would be to go to an airshow at the Shuttleworth Collection some time. It's a few miles away from the Sandy microlight place, and you get to see some pretty awesome planes and stuff which can be inspiring in a way as well.

I see where you're coming from but it's more complicated than that. These schools are almost invariably good schools. They are also schools that are MUCH cheaper than secular state schools. This is because they are subsidised by the Catholic Church (to take that example). The Catholics have hoarded so much cash, I think its good their spending it on Education!

If these religious schools which are proven to work, even if its in a way you don't like, cease to be religious schools, they will cease to be. Like it or not, Religion is about Structure, discipline and hard work. There are many bad things about religion, but those are the good things. These morals are *fantastic* things to be instilling into children.

Lastly I think you're overestimating just how religious these religious schools are. they usually say a morning prayer (if that) and then go on with their day just like any other school. The difference is, that education plugs directly into their everyday lives through religion. Whatever your views on the after life, I think its got to be a good thing to get children disciplined and working.

IMO, Carlo never had to manage players; they were playing at the peak of their form. Even in that period we fielded 11 players rather than a team. Also, Carlo's exit (just like the managers before him) was also due to 'player-power', which puts somewhat of a spanner in your 'Carlo-managed-players-well' theory.

As much as AVB being sacked mid-season might mean the board don't his judgement, it also means that he had lost the dressing-room. That just bugs me. How the fuck do you 'lose' a dressing room? The very statement indicates that the dressing room must be full of fucking prima-donnas who want their egos massaged. FFS, you make in a week what I manage to make in a year and you want your egos massaged?

Torres? He's the new Sheva, no doubt. RA (or whoever makes these decisions) seems to have this super-special talent of finding perfectly good players and ruining their careers by bringing them to Chelsea without consulting the managers.

IMO, a manager doesn't necessarily need people-skills; they are always a bonus. The so-called 'best manager in the history of the club', the self-proclaimed 'Special One', the one who names causes a large chunk of this subreddit to orgasm - Mou - had no more people skills than AVB. In fact, he ended up dividing the players more than most. I'd probably go so far as to say that he's the one who caused the 'player-power' to rear its ugly head. They tasted blood with his departure and have been feasting ever since.

As for RA, I believe it is his coterie of clowns, the three Macbethian witches - Buck, Gourlay &amp; Emenalo - who are the real culprits. They are the ones who have actually 'poisoned' the 'chalice' that you speak of. All the players have to do, is force the managers to drink from it.

You're right, certainly not in this post. I jumped the gun on that, and my apologies to the OP on that. But a number of people in this thread and others similar don't think the church should have any say in politics which I disagree with. I don't think they should have any power, but they should be allowed to say what they like especially if it is something they actually believe rather than to cover up some alternate motive.

&gt;When did anyone encourage spamming? Challenging his bigoted views is not spam. 

Why not find out his phone number and address, then put them up too then? Or would that be going to far? Don't like what he has to say, write to papers with your opposing position, post on blogs why you think he's an idiot. 

Posting his email for everyone to use will result in him simply deleting the majority of them or getting someone else to go through them (as they probably already do). It won't change his opinion, and it doesn't help the cause... it just has the apperence of ""here's how to contact him, lets get everyone sending him emails!!"". 

If you want to email/call someone about it, make it those who actually have a say on the matter, or at least try to change the minds of those who are undecided or might be swayed with sense and logic. It's self-defeating to engage with him if you really think his views are that bad and misguided (as I do).",0,1330879935,null,0,false,0,c3xlggi,t3_qguic,t1_c3xlggi,t1_c3xlbkl,null,1428465802,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

**&lt;TL;DR&gt; I explain why I don't want Jose. Rafa can't do much with this team, Pep needs a La Masia &amp; I dunno about Bielsa.**

Pardon me, I don't understand [/r/chelseafc](/r/chelseafc)'s fascination for Jose. IMO, he's somewhat over-rated, ego-maniacal and dangerous to future development.

[I've already explained this controversial opinion of mine in another comment elsewhere, in another context.](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/qh559/chelsea_just_sacked_avb_your_thoughts/c3xkx2i)

To answer your question, I don't think there's a manager in any of the leagues who can turn the fortunes of this club around. Whoever comes in, knows that some players must go. If he antagonizes them (like AVB did) he'll be shown the door. On the other hand, choosing to play the old-guard is a sure-fire recipe for disaster since they aren't anywhere close to the players they once were. Therefore, disaster and he gets sacked. It is clearly a no-win situation - why would anyone want to tarnish their careers/resumes with it?

Pep? Cobham isn't La Masia. He'll be gone before you can say ""Guardiola!""

Rafa? I'd like to see him try and convince Lamps (&amp; the others) to stop arriving late in the box and provide through balls for Torres.

Bielsa? I haven't seen him in action and can't say much about him.

I'm not saying AVB was perfect for the job but his signings were definitely near-perfect. there isn't a day or a game we don't praise Mata. We've been clamoring for Romeu. Much as we curse Sturridge for being selfish, we've loved watching a youngster rise up the ranks. Opinions may vary over his policies on Lukaku &amp; McEachran but Piazon, Bamford, Davila, De Bruyne, Feruz have been nothing short of revelations. I can only imagine what could have been had he been allowed another transfer window.

You wanted to know about the future? Here's a sneak-peek:

* Romeu, Mata, Luiz &amp; Ramires to Barca - they enter the league of Barca legends within two years.
* Lamps, Cole &amp; Drogba with two year contracts and/or huge severance/release clauses. Two more managers are hired and fired trying to get them to leave.
* Bos, Paulo &amp; Malouda are awarded loyalty contracts - not as high as the 'living legends' but still high, nevertheless.
* Brana &amp; Torres shipped off somewhere - no idea where, but somewhere. The latter starts banging in goals on a regular basis.
* Lukaku &amp; McEachran snapped up by ManU/Liverpool/Arsenal/Newcastle/Swansea who then rise considerably beyond expectations.
* Sturridge expects new manager to start him as no. 9. If yes, he stays for another year before moving back to Man City, 'the club that believed in me'. If not, then simply the latter.
* Two years later, Roman divests his stake in CFC and buys CSKA Moscow. /sarcasm",0,1330882639,null,0,false,0,c3xlubu,t3_qh6lx,t1_c3xlubu,t3_qh6lx,null,1428465985,7,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,7

Exactly, that constitutes ""good reason"". If this is the case then why is it morally wrong to give preference to children who are of that religion? The school is subsidised by that faith. It was set up by that faith, and it is catering to those who support it.

If these schools were so terrible, then they wouldn't be over subscribed would they. 

&gt;That is how the discrimination becomes socio-economic.

The difference between numbers of council estate children and upper middle class children in state religious education is 12%. in other words the difference is minimal.

Lastly I will re-iterate. You can be as poor as you like, and still be religious. It doesn't make a blind bit of difference. Also, as in ALL schools, provision is given to poorer kids over religious kids. If they tick both those boxes in a faith school? great.

What you should realise is that these schools consistently attain average to high grades, at LOWER cost to the tax payers than secular state schools.

To reply to your above comment:

Parents have the right to remove their children from the collective worship element of assemblies, yes. Children over the age of 16 have the right to remove themselves - that came into effect in 2006. Younger than 16 and your parents are religious/want you to? Then you have attend. I don't know about you, but I knew what my opinions on religion were well before I was 16.

&gt; ...based on religion?

They can opt out based on whether or not they want to opt out. Religion or no, kids shouldn't be forced to take part in worship of any kind (the wording of the law is that they *have* to take part, not just attend).

However the problem remains that the collective worship element, if it is included, is generally contained within the assembly and so the removal or absence of a child for the religious aspect means they are probably absent for the assembly in total.

It might be the parent/16+ child's right to not be there, but it means that the child is effectively excluded from general school proceedings. You (or others) might say ""Deal with it - take the rough with the smooth"" but it's not really fair. And there are documented examples of cases where parents have met with difficulties when wishing to remove their child. Dr Lempert is a good example - [2nd audio file down here.](http://poddelusion.co.uk/blog/2011/09/21/secularism-2011-part-2/) Obviously this occurs more in faith schools that not.

As others pointed out, there's lots of schools that don't take any notice of this law. But it's the ones that do that are the problem, as well as it being a **law** of the land - state imposing a religion. The issue has been raised a number of times with the government, but it's always been dismissed. I recall Gordon Brown brushing it off, saying that collective worship (or a primarily Christian nature) was very important for schools.

The question remains: What's the point of the law, if many schools take no notice of it, and how is it justifiable?",0,1330884589,null,0,false,0,c3xm4yo,t3_qh1yj,t1_c3xm4yo,t1_c3xlshu,null,1428466117,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Hang on - the majority of faith schools, Church of England, are funded by the state. To what extent are they subsidised and how? I wasn't aware they were at all and was under the impression that the CoE was heavily strapped for cash. But in any case, any tax payer money being given to an organisation would be why it's morally wrong to discriminate based on (legitimate or otherwise) religious conviction of the child's family. It's state funded discrimination.

&gt; If these schools were so terrible, then they wouldn't be over subscribed would they.

This is circular reasoning. syntax has pointed out a factor as to why the schools are good: They *are* able to and *do* choose which children they let in. There are links further up the thread that attest to how this allows them to out perform other schools - even if that is actually the case over all (links explain why). So the school does better, which then gives rise to ""Well look how many parents want their kids to go there - it proves they're good."" and round and round it goes.

As a slight aside as to the privileges granted to faith schools , how the law allows them to discriminate - about teachers in this case - take note of the Education Bill amendment that was raised in the Lords a little while ago: 

&gt; "" The Lord Bishop of Oxford said he was “shocked at the very thought” that a faith school would ever do such a thing [block non-religious, or gay teachers] – but still opposed the amendment.""[http://www.secularism.org.uk/teacher-discrimination-challenge.html]

&gt; Religious people are a significant demographic of our country and they have the right to educate their children as they please

Religious people have the right to educate their children as they see fit? Well that would be nice, but if you then have kids from non-religious families with no other option but to attend the nearest (state funded) school, then where is that family's right to have their child educated in a non-religious school? Secular schools are the fairest option available really.

La Masia is just a symbol for the midfield-centric, one-touch passing play that Barca are known for. Pep's reliance on such midfielders is what I mean when I refer to La Masia.

As for altering tactics, I haven't seen Barca play anything radically different from the 4-3-3 quick interception, short-passing, quick buildup style of play. I haven't seen Barca sit deep, play long balls often and pass around the back to initiate a quick counter. 

Moreover, Pep's team-setups are alterable because of the depth and quality that his youth system provides. Pep at CFC would be somewhat at a loss because the youth are not good enough for first-team (evidence: Carling cup against Liverpool) and the midfield isn't comfortable with playing possession football. Heck, they can't retain possession in the face of sustained pressure &amp; closing-in - which, IIRC, forms a major part of Pep's philosophy. Chelsea have relied on deep defense and quick counter-attacks since Mou's days. It worked while the players were strong and fast but not anymore, clearly.

Same with Davros. The scene in Stolen Earth when they reveal that it's the Daleks, and you hear them come on the line and go ""EX-TERM-INATE"" and Sarah-Jane and Captain Jack are both crapping a house worth of bricks, and grabbing onto their loved ones. Sarah-Jane going ""You're so young!"" and Jack kissing Ianto and Gwen on the forehead, saying there's nothing he can do, they're all going to die... that scene was amazing.

Also, just about everything in Big Bang Two.

If no, and Jose will probably bring in new players, then why not allow AVB to do the same and build the squad and the style-of-play his way?

Actually that's some research I'm attempting to conduct at the moment, as I think there are a very large number of schools, particularly in more rural areas, that parents have no option but to send their kids to.

Sure we didn't win some games we should have, there were questionable tactics from AVB at times (both on and off the pitch), but he really seemed to have the right idea. Bringing in young players that are exciting to watch and will eventually be the future of the club. Unfortunately, we ripped that out from under him.

One of the things that I wish someone would implement at Chelsea that Pep does is the Busquets role where he keeps play flowing and drops in between the two centerbacks while the very attacking fullback goes forwards. I think with some time, Romeu would be able to do this for us very well. Of course, this relies on not having garbage fullbacks. (being harsh on Ashley, but his recent form really is garbage) It would definitely help our play in that we don't have width in our team and we now have relatively quick centerbacks in Luiz and Cahill.

Lastly, I honestly believe that the board thought he was given enough pieces to rebuild with.

Good point, as that speaks to the ""most important woman"" issue: without The Doctor around it's all about Donna, it all comes down to Donna's actions. Since I didn't understand how and where the parallel universe existed, I couldn't previously understand how Donna's actions there would affect *other* universes. Though it just now occurred to me that The Darkness Rose mentioned was eating its way through universes, so perhaps that was also a factor.

&gt;I assume it is out of phase with that reality, so her clothes move through it and hence why she can't see it/feel it on her and only some people notice, otherwise everyone would see this whopping beetle on her all the time. 

That makes sense, I'll buy that. 

&gt;She said getting to different realities was difficult and that the wrong word to the wrong person could end things, perhaps having Donna go back and do something was less dangerous, plus you are less likely to believe some random psychotic blonde banging on your window screaming ""NO! NO! turn LEFT! LEFT!""

&gt;OR it could be that Rose already missed that time and over shot it, so maybe she couldn't travel through time as well and that through Donna going back in time, Rose was able to follow.

I don't think Davies was dissatisfied at leaving the show.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"First thing you do? Watch Genesis of the Daleks. It shows how good classic is and it's a good intro into getting the feel for old tv. And then I find that the best thing one can do is see 2 or 3 stories from each Doctor and then go through classic straight through. Watching a couple stories from all the Doctors is like building a road map before you actually take the journey itself. So here are some stories for each:

William Hartnell, first- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore. The Romans. The Tenth Planet (though the last part is reconstruction only).

Patrick Troughton, second - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

Jon Pertwee, third- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

Tom Baker, fourth The most famous run. There are so many fantastic stories. Genesis of the Daleks, one of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic. And Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

Peter Davison, fifth -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special, andCaves of Androzani!* (the last story)

Colin Baker, sixth- His Doctor is unique with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good.

Sylvester McCoy, seventh. Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis. This is the era where they really try some crazy radical stories.

Anyways, I'd just like to add on:

**EVERYBODY CHILL THE FUCK OUT.**

Here's our upcoming fixtures:

Everton 	A (13, 2-0 home)

Stoke City 	H (9, we don't speak of that game)

Chelsea 	A (5, currently going through crisis so we'll probably drop points)

Swansea City 	H (14, 1-1 away)

Sunderland 	A (12, 1-0 home)

Norwich City 	H (11, 2-0 away)

Bolton Wanderers 	A (19, 3-0 home)

Queens Park Rangers 	A (16, 3-1 home)

Blackburn Rovers 	H (17, 2-1 away)

Aston Villa 	A (15, 2-0 home)

Fulham 	H(8, 3-1 away)

Speaking in a vacuum, we should not lose any of those games. Will we draw some? Most likely, yes. Chelsea and Sunderland come to mind, possibly Fulham if they keep up their run of form. But **every one of those games are winnable, especially if we are back at full strength**. Last time this happened, we went through 19 games with a record of 14 wins, 4 draws, and one clusterfuck.

This is not the end of the world. Arsenal will drop points. Man United will drop points. Man City will drop points. Liverpool, Chelsea, Newcastle, fucking Leeds, Portsmouth **everybody will drop points between now and the end of the season**. We have a 4 point gap against Arsenal and the lads know they are not invincible. We'll get Bale back next week, hopefully Rafa too, and Lennon looks to be fit for good now. We haven't played at full strength since before the Stoke game, and we haven't had Rafa, Ade, Lennon and Bale on the same field since mid-January. We will have that next week, hopefully, against Everton. If we don't show up next weekend, then panic, yes. However, losing to Man United has hardly ever been the determining factor in our season. It's bad, yes, it sucks, especially the manner that it happened, but it's over now and all we can do is look ahead and get behind the team. We could scream, rage, call for 'arry's head and complain that our players are shit, unmotivated, and mid-table at best. But we're not going to do that because 1) It's categorically untrue, and 2) Because that's what gooners do, and we're better than that.

Absolutely. Just to touch on the devo-max thing again, polls suggest it's favoured by 70% of people in Scotland - it's a clear vote winner, and they could easily take it on as their cause at a time when they really badly need a win here after getting into bed with the Tories, who are pretty much reviled in Scotland.

Then there's Europe. When Cameron pointlessly 'wielded' the veto to appease his backbenchers, without consulting Clegg, his reaction was to not sit next to Cameron during the debate about it. Wow. That must've really shown Cameron. The Lib Dems are Europhiles - they fucking love Europe. His own party should've been livid.

And now they're playing along with a policy that could see the NHS set on the path to becoming something quite different. And if you do anything to the NHS that actively makes it worse, no one votes for you again (or not until they've forgotten about it).

Obviously I don't know how this stuff works - how you form a coalition, what compromises you have to make as the (very much) junior partner. But it does seem more and more like the Lib Dems are compromising a lot.

Essentially, my critique is that you are being hugely assumptive of Guardiola's ability. Barca adapt to the players in their team and adjust to different formations and tactics quite regularly. They have a dominant style of football, which you accurately show. However, you don't even remotely identify the different tactics they play at different times. Specifically, how quickly they escalate attacks, which changes every game, how much pressure they apply and to which players, their defensive line etc. Football for Barca is extremely fluid and different players coming in are playing simply excellently for them (in most cases).

To suggest he wouldn't work at Chelsea as he's one dimensional is crazy. He's playing a style that has generated, quite possibly, the greatest football ever produced. He might not have the same quality players but that doesn't mean he can't adapt his style if necessary. Essentially, it's an unknown.

true,wubblewobble,eng-sussex,West sussex,"&gt; No, they dont but IN a church they do own that term.

Indeed, and I don't think that anything should change in terms of that. For example, if a church doesn't want to marry gay couples, then they shouldn't have to, or if they want to with certain conditions, then so be it too - what goes on in Church  happens by the church's rules as far as I'm concerned.

Outside of the church is more what I was thinking.

&gt; Should gay marriage use the exact terminology of straight marriage, no.

I'm not sure quite what your position actually is. What does the above actually mean, and what would actually differ?

&gt; IS a difference between gay people and straight people

Well yeah - otherwise we wouldn't have the labels ""gay"" and ""straight"".

But within the scope of ""marriage"", I don't think that there is a tangible difference. Gay couples can't of course produce kids between themselves, but they could still adopt or have a surrogate birth, and I don't know, but I guess that sometimes they'll want to change their surnames to match. In my eyes, marriage requires two people who love each other and want to make a statement of commitment towards each other for the rest of their lives.

I don't particularly mind if the church uses a different name - they can hold gayiage ceremonies if they want. The only thing that I'm really concerned about is that the legal covenant that is produced is actually a marriage with all of the same rights and a non-gay marriage, and called by the same name.

TL;DR: I'm not concerned at all what happens within the church - just outside of it - outside of it, I want all types of couple to just be able to get married.

true,mad_disciple,null,null,"I think the problem is the Mourinho expectations that are now almost impossible to match. Then again, how did Avram Grant become manager in the first place? Why appoint Scolari? AVB has no experience, it's an 'out there' appointment in the first place. The process for deciding who gets the hot seat seems completely strange. 

On top of that are the signings for managers instead of by managers. It makes a big difference when a manager can choose his players or not.

That all said, AVB has not done a good job. He's made press mistakes, he's fucked up with the senior staff, he's not played the young players nearly enough and he simply hasn't had any idea when things don't go well. Additionally, at no point has the defence looked anything like stable and the team is just playing worse each game. Since November this has been a shambles, this is the logical conclusion to that. 

I really do see this as a turning point for Chelsea under Abramovich. I think it highly likely the next appointment will be really really carefully considered (I think Mourinho will be top of the list for starters) and I think they'll assess and decide the best way of progressing the club from here. They're gonna take until the end of the season to do so. Well I can hope anyway. It's possible a number of 'advisor' people for Abramovich may move on as they clearly aren't helping him.

true,ghostridethewhip,null,null,"I agree completely. In a strictly playing-on-the-field sense, I think many of the Old Guard have a lot of years left in them, but for Chelsea's sake, we need to cut ties with them and move on. Roman needs to get this, and after this year's failed experiment, he may finally realize that we need to truly rebuild the squad.

The real problem is: who are we going to sign that will have enough cajones to axe the Old Guard? Mourinho has too many personal ties to these players to do it. Pep would never leave Barca for Chelsea, not in a million years. Capello proved that he is a coddler of older players after his England days. Rafa couldn't handle Liverpool or Inter, so no chance he could handle Chelsea.

We need someone with some poise and some gravitas, in addition to the tactical knowledge needed to succeed in England and, more specifically, London. Frankly, there aren't many managers around who would fit the bill.

If I were the next Chelsea manager, here is what I would do: Slash and burn. There are too many big names taking big paychecks and not performing. Day one, I would give them a choice. Take massive pay cuts (I'm talking drop them to the same wages that bit-part Chelsea players are making, a la Fereira, because on my squad, that is what they would be, bit-part players), or find another team. I would tell Sturridge that he is my #1 striker. I would tell McEachran, Kakuta, Bertrand, De Bruyne, Lukaku, and all of the rest of the young players that this is the year they prove to me whether they are first team Chelsea players or not. Give them their trials with the first team. If they don't perform, they stay with the second team, but if they do, they are my new starters. No more of this B.S. where a 17 year old McEachran is competing with Frank Lampard for a starting spot, and if he doesn't measure up, he is cast aside.

• If Jamie makes an impression, The Professor will train him to become a successor

• Another companion, possibly a love interest; although I hate more than one NPC at a time, because I'm lazy. But, my player likes drama and romance plots, so I shall persevere to break her heart like I did last time, because *damn* I'm good at that.

• A UNIT/Torchwood/Taskforce: VALKYRIE (nwod reference) sort of group that The Professor has worked with in the past. Maybe with a few former Companions.

• Someone with a relationship with The Professor, or even Jamie, that they meet in reverse, a la River Song.

• Jamie gets kicked out or leaves The Professor and joins up with UNIT/Torchwood/Taskforce: VALKYRIE.

• The player said she didn't want to keep making new characters, but did admit that playing new Companions might be cool.

• I only just thought of it, but The Professor could ""Reincarnate"" and meet a new Companion at the same time, and we could switch off; she becomes The Professor, and I become the Companion.

• Jamie--at least in the original incarnation of the reused character--is an occult nerd, so I want to have stuff like Shakespeare and Witches, Charles Dickens and ghosts; I have the idea of them working with Bram Stoker and trying to keep him safe from a vampire.

I moved out here 18 months ago to Brisbane, have another 18 months left on my contract and i have loved it. I know Brisbane isn;t a lot of peoples first choice but while it isn;t a great place to visit , it is a great place to live. If you like your outdoors it is even better. We regularly do trips up and down the coast to go camping, and work takes me into the interior of Queensland as well which is nice.

Negatives first:
it is expensive, rent, food, eating out, beer, utilities are all more expensive than the UK The distances can be quite large getting around places can take a while, if you are expecting the latest fashions, shows etc they may take a while to get here.

Positives: you make a lot more money. My ozzie equivalent here makes about 40K pounds more than i do. And with the exchange rate going the way it is, it is only going to get higher.  We have more free time here as well. i find i am out and about far more than i was in the UK, which might be a weather thing, or being in a new country thing but we are visiting places, going camping, eating out, doing sports, travelling far more than when we lived in the UK. people here in general seem to be more active.

I see from your history you are a geo. There is a big demand for that at the moment as there is mining and O&amp;G projects which are requiring more personnel than Australia can supply it self. So check out jobs in Sydney, Brisbane, and Perth. A lot of the operations now are fly in fly out, which means you can choose to live somewhere nice for your time off. A buddy of mine lives up in Noosa for his time off. Which isn;t to hard.

If you aren't having much luck getting a company to sponsor you on a 457 visa initially, try if you are under 30 to get the working holiday visa. I know a number of people who have come out with that one, got a job and were able to convince their employer to sponsor them for the 457. 

Anyways, you haven;t got much to lose taking a punt and giving it a go. it doesn;t have to be forever, a few years or so if you like or even a year. But regardless of the length of time you will be richer in terms of experiences after your time here. I find too many people come up with excuses of why they shouldn;t go. 

edit: i should also mention the food here is fantastic. really some of the best quality fresh fruit and veg and meat i've had fromy our local store.

Instead, all of his players seemed uninterested in the game and didn't feel like winning. At Liverpool, if you're not motivated, you don't play, no matter how good you are.

In the episode we see they both led happily-ever-after lives, but in reality it's unlikely things would have been so easy going and pleasant for them:

**Billy Shipton, a Black man, is sent back to 1969.**

He'd be suddenly chucked into an environment filled with racial discrimination, where racism had only begun to be tackled a few years prior [(1965 Race Relations Act).](http://www.20thcenturylondon.org.uk/server.php?show=nav.44) His near future would be filled with violence [(Vietnam protests, IRA bombings)](http://www.20thcenturylondon.org.uk/server.php?show=nav.45) and social tensions. With a growing job shortage and industrial decline, as a Black man he'd have an even more difficult time finding employment. Interracial relations were not widely welcome (made more poignant after his flirtatious pursuit of the White Sally Sparrow), with race riots [continuing through the 1980s.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_British#Late_20th_century) He'd have to deal with continued political rioting and IRA bombings in the 1980s, along with continued race and class restrictions.

**TL;DR** In short, he'd have to face a lifetime of social and economic restriction and discrimination based on his race, made even more difficult to deal with after the relative freedom of his own time period.


**Kathy Nightingale, an adventurous modern woman, is sent back to 1920.** 

She'd have to wait another [8 years](http://www.20thcenturylondon.org.uk/server.php?show=conInformationRecord.268) before she could vote. Another 6 years before she could own property. Even then she'd still face social discrimination and backlash for engaging in these rights. Many professions would be barred to her, either legally or socially. The The Equal Pay Act wouldn't pass for another [50 years](http://www.20thcenturylondon.org.uk/server.php?show=conInformationRecord.269), by which time she'd be too old to work. She'd have to wait 40 years for access to birth control pills, by which time she'd be too old to need them. 

**TL;DR** In short, she'd have to face a lifetime of social restriction and discrimination based on her gender, made even more difficult to deal with after the relative freedom of her own time period.

I think Jose would play older players if they played well. Mourinho knows how to win. If some older players are not playing to the level he wants, he won't play them. If he is forced to play them (see Shevchenko) he will leave the club...simple as that.

Jose would definitely bring in new, younger players and my sentiments lie with you...why not just let AVB do the same? 

Some people complain about Mourinho saying that he will only be at the club for a few years at best. To be honest, I'm completely fine with that. He will undoubtedly stay longer than the last 5 (FIVE) managers have, and if he does end up leaving (which he will) he will have left us with an ubelievably strong team--much like how our team was winning and competing for years after Jose left with basically the same core of players almost exactly (we won the double with basically Mourinho's squad). 

Now about his style of play--I am pretty tired of people complaining about his style and saying that it is boring. While this might have been true at Chelsea, it is most definitely not true now--just look at Real Madrid; they play wonderful, flowing football with breath taking counter attacks and speed. He injected amazing players into that team and made them young and dangerous. With most of his original spine aging and aged, I think he would continue the Mata, Ramires, Luiz style and build on that, making us a terrifying counter-attacking team that passes the ball quickly and has great width (see Ronaldo and Maria).

true,zumzink,null,null,"&gt; Though there have been non-straight characters in DW, it was never really addressed as an issue.

Personally, that's what I like about the show. It often features gender, race and sexuality as a non-issue -- these are just people, going about their life. Just like in the real world. That kind of approach makes the material more immersive for me. It also helps with suspension of disbelief because the world building seems grounded in a realistic context.

&gt; For me, it just seems that a DW-LGBTetc group would be a very small audience.

That may be true. But in fairness the number of LGBT people is relatively small in comparison to people who identify as straight. So a minority is a minority no matter how you slice it. But I don't think quantity defines quality in cases like this. I figure there's no harm in it, so why not? If only 10 people join but those 10 people have a great, fun, productive discourse about what the show means to them then that's valuable. 

&gt; EDIT: Now I am female and get very riled about sexism, but even here I cannot see the appeal of a feminist DW group. 

Totally understandable if that doesn't interest you. People enjoy the show for a wide variety of reasons, and sometimes you just want to be entertained. 

Personally, for me, it's very hard to discuss shows I love in a vacuum, devoid of social context. That's not a judgment on people who don't, that's just the way my brain works. It's sort of like discovering type kerning: once seen you can't un-see it. And then you can't turn it off. ;) 

If I'm affected enough by the show to bother reading a subred or forum, then I'm personally invested in the show to a degree. I think that's at the heart of more-than-casual fandom. As such, I experience the show in the larger social context of real life, not just in that lovely magic tv vacuum. Therefore I discuss it in that manner as well. I'll venture that people who are interested in a special focus fan group approach the show similarly.

Well, there's intention, and then there's reality. The fact is there ARE members of this subreddit who do NOT welcome all types. There are over 45,000 people subscribed. Even if this subred is a paragon of inclusiveness, statistically speaking there are bound to be people with bias toward gender, race, sexuality, age, religion, whatever. 

And frankly, many places on reddit are not friendly to the LGBT individuals. Some are outright hostile. I don't know the atmosphere on this subred toward outwardly LGBT individuals, so I can't speak to that.

I feel that the intellectual and social activity of critiquing a show -- no matter how silly, online or in person -- is just good mental exercise. It improves our pattern recognition, media literacy, social awareness, creative expectations, writing skills. It can get us in the pattern of general critical thinking and being open to learning, which I think is a nice upside to an otherwise trite pastime. So even if relationships don't develop as a result, a show can still offer those benefits.

However I am a minority, most people in my position would still list themselves as Catholics purely because they were baptised, confirmed and raised as such. They don't list their religion based on their actual, personal beliefs and the fact is that many people rarely contemplate it or sit back and think about it properly.

I do believe that Britain will become a majorly non-religious country in the coming decades though, because less and less parents are bothered about baptising their children or registering them as Christians or Catholics or whatever. Islam could even overtake Christianity on that front since Muslims still seem to actively practice their religion and there are a lot of Muslims in the UK. Maybe. I don't know the exact stats.

The only thing slowing it down is the amount of religious primary schools that remain, that will still teach children about religion.

Do you mean that you wish you knew other fans IRL, people who enjoy DW as much as you do? So you can squee and cry and yell together over episodes, or have discussions about them?

I don't get that opportunity often, but I have been fortunate to connect with other fans in person. 

I used to work with a guy who was into *Buffy* at the same time I was. Sometimes we'd watch the episodes in our own homes, then call each other frantically during the commercial breaks --- ""zomg can you believe that? holycowzomgbbqkitten! okokok it's back on I have to go."" It was silly and totally like teens from an 80s movie, but it was also ridiculously fun. 

Another time a friend's co-worker organized a *Buffy* viewing party for one of the season's finale. And that was similar. Like 8-10 adults smooshed into a living room and glued to the tv, then breaking into a mayhem of conversation during the commercials, then back to the show. That was also enjoyable because the energy bounced around and kept everyone into the spirit.

I remember in high school there'd be a show that was popular (this is pre-Tivo and internet tv), so you'd know people watched it the night before, and I'd come into home room and we'd last maybe 5 minutes before someone blurted out ""OMG DID YOU SEE THAT LAST NIGHT? SQUEAL SHOUT MAYHEM MAYHEM OMG!"" The energy was infectious and fun and I enjoyed the indulgence. 

Do you mean things like that? Where you could invite friends over for an episode or a film and everyone geeks out together?

Yes, Arsenal and Chelsea have been shaky this year. Arsenal mostly because of injuries and suspensions at the start of the season. 

In the games this season, with exception of Spurs and Bolton away, and maybe Swansea at home, we have been pretty decent. I would say the only time I felt we were really deservedly beaten, after putting in a good shift, was Man City away.

When men are throwing acid in their womens faces, we should not be tolerant of Islam.

When men are dropping bombs on their neighbors, we should not be tolerant of Judaism.

When men are raping small children, then covering it up, we should not be tolerant of Catholicism.

Tolerism is a misnomer anyway, it's a word that should never need to be used in a civilized society. When someone is acting in a socially acceptable moral way, there is no NEED to ""tolerate"" him, as he is doing nothing wrong. Tolerance is only ever used in the context of somebody doing something that is socially or morally UNacceptable, but letting it pass anyway because he is of a certain group or heirarchy. This is why I commented about religion getting a free pass on many activities and behaviour that in any other context would be socially unacceptable, morally reprehensible and of dubious legality. But we let it pass, because ""being tolerant"" is the new PC buzzword.

Fuck tolerism. If someone is doing something wrong, you tell them, regardless of who they are or where they go on Friday / Saturday / Sunday.

I'm quite happy for anyone to practice any religion, (no matter how misguided it may be), provided they don't encroach on the rights of others, including family members. No one should be forced (indoctrinated) into any religious group until they are of legal age and qualified to make up their own minds.

&gt;well that's slightly besides the point. 

Not really, as I've mentioned before, this is not some kind of hidden agenda. It's all in the open.

&gt;What about all the parents who don't have a viable option of where to send their kids? 

Again, why can't you opt your child out of such activities if they really are a recruitment center.

&gt;The overall issue is whether or not the government should fund schools that effectively teach a child a religion, rather than about religion.

Schools don't really work without funding so cutting the money doen't really help anyone. 

&gt;teach a child a religion, rather than about religion.

Can't parenting solve this issue? (Thats providing it is as extreme as its being made out to be)
The fact that theres a new generation of children being none religious means that what ever efforts the schools are making, don't really work that well.

true,tamuowen,lfc68,null,"See I think Dempsey could absolutely be good enough to play for Liverpool. I mean, he's at least as good as Jordan Henderson or Charlie Adam and certainly scores more goals than either.  And I think he would be perfectly capable of being a squad player who is a reliable option. 

But I don't think he's the type of player we need. Dempsey is played best as more of an forward attacking midfielder with the freedom to play up front with the striker. He's never really been a true striker, even though he is an excellent header of the ball and is a good finisher. 

Dempsey can also be a bit wasteful at times, and he takes a large number of shots at Fulham; their attacks usually center around his ability to create chances for himself or others. 

So I think Dempsey would best be played in the position currently occupied by Suarez, and he simply isn't as good as Suarez. While he could certainly be played in the midfield teamed with a defensive partner (Lucas), I don't really see that position as his strength. He's a complete player but not a great midfielder. And obviously we want Gerrard playing by Lucas ideally. 

Dempsey could play out right or left, and might do better than Downing has done for us this season. But I don't think he would be exceptional out there, perhaps serviceable; he's not quite as good when he's played out wide.

In 1991, I obtained evidence that the Royal Ulster Constabulary [RUC], the British Government's police force in Northern Ireland, was secretly running ""death squads."" Senior RUC officers were helping a then unknown terrorist organisation -- ""the Committee"" -- to assassinate Republicans, Nationalists and innocent Catholics in an effort to block any moves towards a united Ireland.

These revelations were contained in a documentary, shown on British television, in which an anonymous member of this Committee testified publicly about the murder conspiracy. He admitted that his Committee, which was composed of fifty to sixty people drawn exclusively from the Ulster Protestant community, was using two professional assassins, known as ""The Jackal"" and ""King Rat,"" to kill those deemed to be ""enemies of Ulster."" The two assassins, he said, were routinely guided to their targets by the police. And that, he boasted, was the reason why these murders would forever remain officially ""unsolved.""

After those local connections, there is more of a sense of a wider black community than there is a white community, because the pressures put upon them by society have traditionally been more similar. So the rioting spread partly through this shared sense of grievance, partly through opportunism. 

Similar situations do happen with white people, such as those who joined in the recent riots, or the Bradford and Oldham riots. But in those situations the majority of white people don't feel any connection with those white minorities, because they do not lead in particular the same kind of lives, or feel under the same kind of pressures, any more than than brown haired people do with others who have brown hair. And the white rioters are criticized in exactly the same terms as black rioters by the rest of society.

Edit: In other words, 'the black community' is an artificial concept, created by racism and the perception of racism, and it will become less and less relevant as black people feel they are treated equally and fairly. Without racism, the black community is the Jamaican community, the Ugandan community, the Nigerian community, just as the white community is made up of various immigrant groups from Germany,Poland, America, Ireland, France and so on, both recent and ancient.

It really is hard to say; how far do you want to live away from the city centre, what do you normally spend your money on, what cars do you like? Off the top of my head the cheapest brand new car you can purchase here (Asian) is roughly $14,000, but keep in mind it is nothing special. Golfs and the like are regularly around the 34-36,000 mark, large cars similar again.

 Groceries are pretty much the same, although your chains do have some better deals on most products.

 Housing is the biggest ""ugh"" factor. It seems very similar to London, not really more expensive. If your looking at Sydney though, good fucking luck. I'd wager its almost worse as the density is nowhere near as high so you'd end up far away. Best bet is a smaller city, or even Melbourne. Keep in mind public transport is woeful if you are used to the wonderful Tube (at least in comparison), so you pretty much *will* need a car.

Here's [news piece](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/dec/26/scrap-compulsory-acts-of-worship) from 2010 about further calls to ditch it - obviously Gove etc. ignored it.

&gt; The government believes that the requirement for collective worship in schools encourages pupils to reflect on the concept of belief and the role it plays in the traditions and values of this country,"" a spokeswoman for the DfE said.

Here's a piece by [Andrew Copson from a few months ago](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2011/sep/11/daily-worship-schools-law). And a BHA link [from around that time](http://www.humanism.org.uk/news/view/885).

&gt; Not really...It's all in the open.

I think it's besides the point because it's a state funded school effectively forcing religion on children. In many (not all) faith schools they teach about their faith throughout the curriculum. It's not really possible for a parent to keep their child from being taught/instructed in it when it leaks into lessons other than RE.

&gt; Schools don't really work without funding

What funding? State funded primarily, if not completely. I saw someone in this thread yesterday (might have been you?) saying that Roman Catholic churches have a lot of money and help the schools that way. I'm not really sure about subsidies or how much money institutions put in to schools they run so I'll ask you on that front: evidence?

But RC schools only account for ~10% of all schools in the UK. The CofE runs ~20%. It's not really that much overall and I question how much that extra funding, if there is any, makes any major difference.

&gt; ...don't really work that well.

Then why do they want to keep hold of schools? I see two scenarios: 1 - Faith schools use schools to indoctrinate children. That isn't fair on children, particularly the kids from families with no religion (mind you it's not fair on the kids anyway), nor should it be acceptable in a state funded school in the 21st century. or 2 - Faith schools aren't using their schools to indoctrinate children.

1 is actually the reality, even if it doesn't work very well anymore. But even if it weren't: 1 is unfair as I point out above and the state shouldn't be funded such activities. Meanwhile if 2's true, then why do they want to teach kids?

&gt;Fallacy four is the idea that academies and free schools are part of the localism agenda. Nothing could be further from the truth. I quote from the DfE website: ""The Young People's Learning Agency will fund, monitor, regulate and handle complaints about academies."" This isn't localism – it is a massive centralisation of our school system. Incidentally, this concern is shared by many Conservative councillors too.

However, my experiences are not dissimilar to yours - I lived in rural Sussex, on the northern edge of Brighton, all my life before I moved to Swansea for university. I've got more attached to south Wales than I ever expected to - I love the deserted beaches and mountains, the down-to-earth towns, and most of all the friendly, welcoming attitude of just about everyone I've met. It's a generalisation but every time I've been north of Hadrian's Wall, while most people are friendly, there is a real and general undercurrent of anti-southerner feeling almost everywhere - I see it in constant ""jokes"" made in front of me, ""it's a shithole""-bashing from people who've been to England, or just strangers being a little more wary than expected. etc. etc. 

In Swansea, that unpleasant feeling of general, difficult-to-pin-down slight unwelcome is completely absent. Strangers start conversations, and I love that. It doesn't matter which pub you walk into, as long as you're not a pretentious twat and go in with a friendly manner, you can have a chat with just about anyone. Similarily, I feel absolutely fine in the supposedly-sketchy areas of town, it's a lot less rough than bits of English cities can be. So I think it gets an undeserved bad rep from the ignorant, and it's a place that makes me happy. Cardiff, although I've only been a handful of times, can hold its own against any small English city - loads to see and do. As for my favourite place ever, you absolutely have to visit the Gower Peninsula and its beaches sometime - Cornwall minus the tourists.

Not cheaper fares alone perhaps, but factor in things like congestion charges and the seemingly exponential rise in motoring costs – far outstripping inflation, I'm sure – and cheap public transport begins to look like a much more attractive proposition to those taxpayers who have to travel a lot. 

Look, I don't like the coming changes any more than the next person – owning a car gives me a degree of personal freedom that will be impossible to get from public transport – but we have to be realistic about what is (a) possible to sustain with dwindling resources and (b) necessary to protect the environment. Again, assuming that the environment is indeed in need of such protection. For the moment at least, enough people think it is to make burying our collective heads in the sand not an option. 

&gt;I think those in charge of public transport should be encouraged to attract customers by offering a better service not a cheaper one.

true,widgetas,null,null,"Indeed, that is very true. However, I think we can arrive at the conclusion a different way.

It is 'common knowledge' that faith schools are better than run of the mill schools. (~1/3 of UK schools are faith schools, but 2/3 of the 'best' schools are faith schools), so generally they are going to get more attention than not - I think that's fair to say. That's regardless of why they're better.

Next, kids usually go to a close school if not the closest. Catchment areas work that way after all, but of course in some areas there's going to be more than one choice. I would imagine that faith schools get a higher number of applicants than non. You're going to have far more affluent/supportive parents applying to faith schools again because they are known to be better - we know this to be true (various surveys iirc). So the proportion you find will still be 'off' and you can say ""Well look it's because more better-off parents are applying, not that the school is shunning the less well off."" It's a self perpetuation machine in that respect. I would predict that the proportion of better-off parents applying to the schools is higher than representative of the local areas, and that non-faith schools do not get so many applicants from the well off. Supposition, of course, as I don't think that data will ever be available.

Can we 'blame' faith schools for this disparity? To an extent, as they aren't ensuring they represent the local community or give local children equal access. But also it undermines the claim that faith schools are 'better' due to their ethos and teaching. That's generally used to bolster their take over or start of other schools.

true,onefingerattack,IE,ireland,"&gt;you have to read up what his Porto players have to say about him.

Porto have won the Portuguese league 6 times in the past 7 years. Year in and year out, it ends up being a cake walk for them. During his season at Porto, AVB didn't have to deal with a bad patch or a tough string of games. He didn't have to deal with strong competitive teams like United, City, Arsenal and Spurs. They basically flew on a high all season, so of course you'll be hard-pressed to find a Porto player that will criticize him or his management skills. However, the real question isn't whether or not he can man-manage players when the results are going well. The real question is: How does he cope under stress? How does he react when things aren't going his way? Does he blame others? Does he lash out at other people? If stories of him sleeping in the training ground are true, then obviously he was lacking the experience that is needed when managing a top tier team.

Nobody is disagreeing with the fact that a lot of our older players need to go. Hopefully, this summer, we'll see a lot of them go. However, the problem was: AVB alienated those older players far too quickly, even though he still partially relied on them in order to pull us through. Rule #1: If you're forced to make enemies with somebody, make sure that you've declawed them well beforehand.

I agree that I was being hugely assumptive of Guardiola's ability and I shouldn't have done that probably. However, since we were looking at scenarios I stated the scenario that I thought was the most likely.

IMO, every team makes a few minor adaptations to the team depending on the players on the pitch but essentially the overall tactics remain, more or less, the same. The on-pitch dynamics will always ensure that no team (however precise and perfect their tactics are) will be able to carry them out in exactly the same manner in every game. However, that doesn't mean they switch tactics radically for different teams, either. Minor adjustments, yes but a team that is used to playing a high-line, quick tempo game will not settle while playing a deep-line, slow tempo game, especially if the players are unwilling - which is essentially what happened at Chelsea.

To me, Barca's transfers reflect the kind of game they play. For instance they will definitely prefer RVP over Drogba - even when both of them are banging in goals on a regular basis. Why? Because (IMO) Barca's style of play is more suited to what RVP expects. Just an example.

I never said Pep was one-dimensional. My statements were based on the assumption (and the fact) that Roman wants Chelsea to play the Barca-style of football. Also, a large part of Pep's success was partly down to the factors you mentioned: La Masia is where they have been learning the 'Barca-style' and Camp Nou is where they have been displaying it for quite a few years now. Add to that, he's played with some of the older players in the team and he has already gained their respect. It makes a lot of difference to the players coming in if the existing players respect the manager. 

To round it off, when RA asked the La Masia academy director how much time he would need to get Cobham playing like Barca/La Masia, he was told, ""Ten years."" This, to me, indicated that to play the Barca-style of football with the current squad of seniors/reserves/youngsters right-away is, quite simply, a pipe-dream. Hence, on the basis of this little nugget, I stated that ""Cobham is no La Masia."" Hope I am making sense.

I would like to respectfully disagree with your statement that he has different tactics he plays at different times. IMO, he hasn't changed the tactics too much - a couple of tweaks here and there, yes, but I haven't seen a drastic change. I must admit that I haven't followed the La Liga all that closely and I have based my opinions on whatever I have managed to watch so maybe I am completely wrong. Then again, maybe I have watched the right games so I might be right.

If he does come to Chelsea, he will definitely get greater respect than AVB, I agree. However, I have my own reservations about both the assumptions: 

1. That players might agree to his style of football 
2. That he might succeed in adapting his tactics to the existing players

Moreover, claiming that he can adapt his style if necessary is as assumptive as claiming he can't - so I guess we're on even keel there. We each have reasons to stick to our own beliefs and until the scenario actually pans out we won't know. Then again, most of this discussion is assumptive, anyway.

While she becomes eligible for parole (not full release - just release on licence) in 25 years time, and her partner will become eligible for parole in 30 years time, that's no guarantee that they'll actually be allowed to leave the prison gates.

Further, they will never be truly free - at best, having received a life sentence, they will be [released on licence](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/CrimeJusticeAndTheLaw/Sentencingprisonandprobation/Probation/DG_196038). This means three things:

 * There will be a whole pile of conditions imposed on them. Some aren't going to be a big deal (like ""do not get arrested for anything, or you go straight back to jail""). Others will be a big deal (""you must not leave the house between 8pm and 8am without written permission from your probation officer"").
 * Any time where they're asked to declare criminal convictions (e.g. applying for a job), they will legally be required to declare that they're out on licence. Forever. This will not go away, as someone on licence can be recalled to jail via an administrative process, often for what would otherwise be a minor offence.
 * They will have to go through a hefty set of processes to leave the country. Our officials will want to be satisfied that they're not simply preparing to run away and disappear, the country they're visiting will want to be satisfied that they're not a danger.

Remember that the key difference between ""release on licence"" and ""release at end of sentence"" is that someone released on licence is still technically a prisoner, they're just no longer held in a prison.

However, recently, it feels as if all of the signs have started to point towards the possibility of his return (or at least: the possibility of him engaging in talks with Roman). 

He has constantly re-stated how his managerial career at Chelsea was the happiest time of his life. He has said that it pains him to see the squad that he built perform so badly. A year after he had walked away, Roman gifted him a Ferrari for his birthday, so apparently, they're still on good terms. A few weeks ago, someone in his camp was intentionally spreading rumors about how Mourinho would like to return to Chelsea again if he were able to get a number of assurances from Abramovich. It's clear that there is unrest at Real Madrid and it's beginning to look as if he wants to leave them in the summer. Last week, he bought a family home in London. When asked about it, he said that it was his own personal business, when he could have easily laid all of the rumors to rest by coming up with an excuse. Even the bookies have him pegged as one of the most likely people to succeed AVB.

All in all; it's not certain who will be appointed in the summer. However, saying that the return of Mourinho is a pipe dream is just a bit much.

Totally wouldn't blame JD if he jumped ship during the summer though. If I was scoring in every game I played and still couldn't get a start, I'd probably want out too.

&gt; ""Hershey process"" milk chocolate is popular in North America. It was invented by Milton S. Hershey, founder of The Hershey Company, and can be produced more cheaply than other processes since it is less sensitive to the freshness of the milk. The process is a trade secret, but experts speculate that the milk is partially lipolyzed, producing **butyric acid**, which stabilizes the milk from further fermentation. This compound gives the product a particular sour, ""tangy"" taste, to which the American public has become accustomed, to the point that other manufacturers now simply add **butyric acid** to their milk chocolates.

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butyric_acid

&gt; Butyric acid is found in butter, Parmesan cheese, and **vomit**, and as a product of anaerobic fermentation (including in the colon and as body odor).

**tl;dr:** American chocolate tastes like vomit because they add vomit flavouring to it!

That said, there are plenty of nice and gourmet chocolates made in the US too, they're not all that bad.

In 1995–96, he was assistant coach of VfB Stuttgart with coach Rolf Fringer. As Fringer had the opportunity to become Swiss national coach, Löw was promoted caretaker manager in August 1996 and finally team manager. With the so-called ""Magic triangle"" consisting of players Krassimir Balakov, Giovane Elber, and Fredi Bobic, the team played a successful season and won the National Cup Final (DFB-Pokal). The following year, his team finished fourth in the Bundesliga and reached the final of the European Cup Winners' Cup, but they lost 1–0 against Chelsea.
Löw left Stuttgart in July 1998 and joined Fenerbahçe. In October 1999, he became coach of Karlsruher SC, but he could not avert relegation to the third division and was dismissed. From December 2000 to March 2001, Löw returned to Turkey as coach of Adanaspor, but he was again dismissed due to poor results.
In October 2001, Löw became coach of Tirol Innsbruck and led the team to the Austrian championship in 2002. The same year, the club had to declare bankruptcy and was liquidated. Löw was once again unemployed. His last job on club level was with FK Austria Wien (June 2003 – March 2004).

Targets like Hazard or Moura would no longer be viable.

It's totally different from UK chocolate, not better, just different and I always look forward to getting back to the states to scoff some more. Being so different makes it doubly cool, because when I get to the US and have a Hershey's I'm like ""Damn, I missed this stuff!"" then when I get back to the UK and have proper chocolate I think exactly the same.

I think all American chocolate is pretty much the same, their M&amp;M's are the same too but have the sweetness from the covering that makes them a weird kind of sweet and sour mixture.

At no point were civilians being attacked. Artillery and airstrikes were never used. The Libyan military didn't get involved until *after* the rebels had murdered hundreds of people (mostly in cold-blooded executions) and destroyed military bases, banks and government buildings. The government rape squads didn't exist. The ""black mercenaries"" didn't exist, that was just an excuse for ethnic cleansing (Al Qaeda doesn't like black people). It was all lies, gleefully reported by a media that was instructed to create public consent for intervention. Both the CIA and MI6 have been proven to be active in Libya in February, preparing for the conflict. One of the top commanders in the new government spent the last ten years working with the CIA in Virginia and coincidently popped up in Libya at just the right time to take the reigns. 

We helped an armed group (who fought *against* us in Iraq) conduct a political coup to obtain exclusive oil contracts with the new government (locking out China and Russia). This action led to far more deaths than were being ""reported"" in those early days. Both the NATO airstrikes *and* rebel attacks independently killed more civilians than Gaddafi's troops. Since the conflict has ended they have looked up over 7000 political prisoners with constant reports of widespread torture. Mass graves have been found, ethnic cleansing has been rife (one town of 30,000 has been completely wiped out) and there is evidence of mass rape. They really really don't like blacks.

&gt;The Yard paid a total of £7,175 earlier this year to enable former assistant commissioner John Yates to hire the law firm Carter Ruck after a national newspaper published an article that he believed questioned his integrity with regard to the investigation of the News of the World phone-hacking scandal.

Rather this is referring to a scheme where the long term unemployed (6+ months at least I believe) are taken out of the control of the Job Centre and transferred to the private sector, who hire trainers and tutors to help those people find jobs. These private sector companies, in this case A4E, are paid to provide this service by the government - firstly with an upfront payment, a second payment once the person has found employment for 26 weeks and further payments if they stay in that job upto another year.

The real question is how much was the initial payment? Less than 1 in 50 people on these courses have found long term employment through them - So if we say a reasonable cost to an employer to hire an employee at low/minimum wage for 6 months was £12,500 - then unless the initial payments were less than £250 per person accepted onto a course it would literally have been more cost effective to hire as many of these people ourselves ie. the government would of employed them to some end.

I don't believe you can go straight from a working holiday to permanent residency. Normally that co es after living at least 2 years in the country. Which is hard to do on the working holiday as it is a one year visa. Most people got from a 457 to PR. I do believe you apply directly for PR before you get tot he country but it does take a while, I.e months to get.

The plus of the working holiday visa is that you are not beholden to one company, and you can move around. With the 457 you are belonging so to speak to the company that has sponsored you. So if you quit, you need to make sure your new employer has your visa transfer all I. The works. Otherwise you have 30 days to find a new company and get the visa transferred

For convenience, I will call the company that developed MK MKC.

Doctor pretends to be a journalist and asks the chief programmer about MK. When asked how he came with such a brilliant programming, he replies he simply worked hard on it. Doctor asks about his appreance in the game and the forbidden command and he answers he appreared in the game as a joke and the forbidden command is an exaggerated reflection of MK's popularity. Doctor then asks some lead on questions about alien species and the programmer again responds implying he has no clue what Doctor is talking about. Doctor cannot find anything unusual about him so ends the interview and investigates inside MKC more but finds no clue. 

In the meanwhile, the epidemic of Toasty is spreading rapidly day by day. Commercials, popular up to date songs, movies and even other games make MK references - the famous 'TOASTY!!!' and MK's excessive violence. It reached the point 'Toasty' is seen and heard as often as 'Bad Wolf' once was. Gamers who input the forbidden command are saying the word 'Toasty' more and often as time passes and becoming cold bloodedly violent. 

Doctor is convinced MK triggers human's subconscious desire for violence. Even though he still cannot figure out how humans in 20th century developed a code that will be widely used in the future. TARDIS detects an abnormality in energy level around MKC. It is energy used for highly advanced inter- dimensional warping - not as crude as the method developed by Pete's World but almost as advanced as what Time Lords once used. Doctor heads over to MKC to find out more.

Doctor eventually finds out the chief programmer was unknowingly helped by someone from another dimension. Doctor cannot make an inter-dimensional communication or trip so decides to lure the one that helped write the code. The chief programmer becomes possessed and starts explaining to Doctor about the code. Doctor acts interested in purchasing the fully developed version of the code. The possessed programmer who refers to himself as 'Commander' explains - he has been developing a way to improve soldiers in his world and the world Doctor is visiting is an experimental field. The word 'Toasty' was just added because the chief programmer thought would be funny to put in the game and but Commander thought it was catchy and handy enough to use as a command word. He also says the progress of the experiment is almost complete at this rate thanks to the 'luckily found experimental opportunity' and the whole humanity will be soon 'Toastied', meaning humans will be blood thirsty soldiers that are unconsciously waiting for orders from Commander.

Messi, Iniesta, Pique, Fabregas, and Xavi all starters for the first team have been playing together now since the mid nineties. This has a lot to do with Guardiola's success. He would have a hard time managing the various personalities of Drogba, Lampard, Terry, and other senior players.

Gus Hiddinck-has been signed to Anzhi in Russia so he's out.

Mourinho-While he did do magnificent things with the club some years ago the question that begs to be asked is how he would re shape the team. Also, if Roman Abramovich would give him total control over the club the way he would want, and the budget he would want for the transfer market. If he did get his way there is virtually no way Chelsea would qualify for Fair Financial Play. However, I believe Mourinho is the one of the few managers aside from the likes of Hiddinck who can control the senior players.

Rafa Benitez-Would be interesting to see how he would do at the club, his arrival could mark the end of Drogba, Lampard, Terry, Cole, and Essien before the end of the year (Dec 2012).

I was all on the Harry Redknapp bandwagon back when he managed Portsmouth, and that clearly worked out well for Tottenham.

Not everybody is going to be a Redknapp, but if you think about it, we haven't had a British manager for a very long time. No language barrier with the English-speaking players, used to the London press as they have (likely) played/(hopefully) managed in the top flight in England, more relatable to fans locally, could handle young British talent better than other managers (specifically thinking about McEachran, Sturridge, Chalobah, etc.).

It may sound superficial, but its an option we haven't tried that could certainly tame the vitriol from the press to some extent. No more exotic manager from a faraway land whose every step needs to be analyzed by thousands of eager reporters looking for a misstep. Just a conservative British/Scottish manager, maybe with some wit and charm to shut the press out. I'd almost take someone boring at this point, so long as they quieted down the firestorm.

Someone like Martin O'Neill, or Brendan Rodgers (if we can get past more inexperience), or David Moyes. Anybody who the fans will accept and the media will leave alone, at least relative to the thrashing they have gotten in recent years.

Even when the YNWA players of LFC do poorly, it's forgiven because we *trust* them. Sounds weird, I know. It's like an exclusive club made up by the fans that the players have to earn, and finally become accepted, praised, and loved.

If there are people in the team that have earned ""YWNA"" by its fans, its Pepe, Skrtel, Agger, Carragher (out of loyalty recently, though his form is slipping) Leiva, Gerrard, Suarez, Kuyt, and Bellamy. Those who are getting closer to that YNWA status are Henderson, Maxi, Carroll and Johnson. Out of those four Johnson is probably the highest right now (imo). Dalglish is really iffy right now because of his questionable results, actions and tactics, despite his accomplishments in the club.




Edit: Haha wow. I said it didn't apply to me... I said what it *seems* to me by reading this subreddit... Im trying to make it fit by proposing this ""club"" concept. I don't condone this ""club"" whatsoever. I've always been a supporter of LFC and always have faith to the bitter end despite my disdains and qualms. Don't bury me please, I think you guys misunderstood. 

Edit2: I'M GOING TO SAY THIS AGAIN. I don't condone this ""club"" of sorts, I made this concept trying to ""justify"" or ""explain"" why those fans that OP mentioned YNWA, I'm trying to ""define"" their version of YNWA.

I am a loyal fan of LFC. Despite my disdain for some players, I still have hope no matter how much I dislike them. I watch every game, I am a chat room regular, my room is decorated with posters, scarves and stickers. My FUT in FIFA 12 is revolved around liverpool players.

People wore suits to my uni interview, they looked daft because nothing fitted them at all very well. They're not expecting you to be dressed like the dogs bollocks or anything like that.

For reference, here is what i would wear if i had to go to one tomorrow. I might also wear a blazer but i don't currently own one in a suitable colour.

So we tried to become a subcontractor as we work with and support a lot of unemployed people as we sort of provide most of this service already. 

I was doing most of the work for this and I ended up learning just how awful a scheme it will be, they arent going to be any good. There was a lot of evidence from similar projects (not least the last government's relatively similar but smaller scale scheme for the long term unemployed which was an abject failure and yet they still subcontracted in some of the firms that failedi n providing that...) that it didnt work as a concept.

The whole thing really bothers me and the more i found out how it would work, how the financial incentives worked etc the more I disliked it on both a practical and philosophical term. It simply cant create jobs

 My contract finished before this all came to an end and I dont think I ever saw an amount, just percentages and when they get paid. However it became clear that as the lion's share of the payment had to be upfront otherwise none of the companies would take the contract and risk losing huge amounts of money it utterly killed the larger point of the incentive.

Not that the incentive would have worked, simply because there usually arent the jobs. ",0,1330998001,null,0,false,0,c3y2avc,t3_qilly,t1_c3y2avc,t1_c3xyg3m,null,1428473948,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The Doctor invites them back to the Tardis for a quick getaway, but it is at this point that he realises the key is missing. He figures he must have dropped it somewhere, and tries to ask the ship's computer system if such an item has been found. After the computer refuses, he uses his sonic screwdriver to bypass the security. Fri, Tri and Mri flee at the fear of being found at the scene of a crime. The Doctor finds out where the key is, and to his horror he sees it has been filed under 'dem503' and before he can find out any more the security kicks in and alarms go off everywhere. The 2 flee, knowing they need to figure out what the code refers to in order to escape the ship.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"What the hell is this? There is a YNWA club? Dalglish is iffy? Are you even a Liverpool fan? 

Your last sentence is the worst of the worst. There are 3 people who exemplify YNWA. Shankly, Paisley and Dalglish. If you are a Liverpool fan, these 3 are your gods. There are no two ways about it. 

You'll Never Walk Alone is a creed. Liverpool fans support their club to the end, and never turn on them. You don't turn on a player because they have lost form, or are old, or are performing poorly. You don't turn on a manager because his tactics are out-dated, or have a dodgy transfer policy. You can criticize them, but you don't turn on them. 

The behaviour and speech of some so-called Liverpool fans in recent years have been absolutely disgusting. Calling for Hodgson's head, calling for Carroll's head, and now some are calling for Dalglish's head. Are you kidding me? Roy Evans never won anything during the Spice Boys period, but everyone loved him because he was a part of Liverpool and we are a part of Liverpool. Was it disappointing? Sure, but we played attractive football and stayed true to the Liverpool way and that was what counted. 

Even during the Hodgson era, I refused to turn on him. He was out of his depth at a club that was facing financial ruin and his tactics had never been in sync with ours even before he came here. Could we have done better? Yes. Was it an improvement to have Dalglish? Yes. Should Liverpool fans call for him to be sacked? NO. 

A Liverpool fan doesn't look at a former contributor at the club and think  ""Oh this guy sucks because he did this-and-this and was terrible."" We look at a guy and think ""Oh he could have done better and this-and-this, but he tried his hardest and he gave us his best moments during that-and-that."" Did Souness screw up our golden years? Yes. Is he pariah at the club? No. In fact, to this day many fans remember him fondly because even though he was an abysmal manager, the years when he played for us were gorgeous, and you always remember someone for the good they have done you, not that bad that should be forgotten. 

Don't talk to me about form, or performance. Liverpool played like crap in the first half during Istanbul, but the fans didn't give up. We didn't give up because we love this club, even in defeat. I have been through the Souness years. The Evans years. That time when every Liverpool fan's heart skipped a beat when we heard of Houllier's heart problems. The wild celebration when we won the treble, even though so many called it the Mickey Mouse treble. Rafa made mistakes when he was with us. I hated that we lost Alonso because of his ridiculous fascination with Gareth Barry. Yet I don't begrudge him a thing, because he gave his all with us while working with difficult owners. He motivated the team at Istanbul. He sat on the grass during the penalty shootout in the FA Cup final. He gave us Torres, who broke the goal scoring record in his debut years. He brought us to 2nd place and 4 points behind Man United, the closest we've been to winning the title in decades. For all his mistakes, these are the reasons why we love him. 

Go listen to the song. Listen to the lyrics. That is what it means to be a Liverpool fan. That is what You'll Never Walk Alone means. Everything you said is plain garbage, and you should seriously reconsider if you're a Liverpool fan.
