In the United States Borders signed an exclusivity deal with Amazon - they'd promote the website in store, and divert online customers to Amazon. By the time they were able to get out of the contract Borders were haemorrhaging money. Combined with the belief eBooks wouldn't take off? They sequentiality went out of business.

Similarly in the U.K. Waterstone's when they were part of HMV did all their online business through Amazon. Having gotten the site back, again, dismissing eBooks as being dead on arrival, then panicking, trying to build their own eReader before admitting defeat? They then go and sign a deal to sell Kindles in their physical stores, in a manner that effectively means people might pick one up from the store, but that all purchases will be done directly with Amazon.

Etc. Etc.

Fact is most stores - be it electrical stores, music stores, book stores etc. can't compete with Amazon and other online retailers, when it comes to stock and price. I ordered a book from Amazon last week - it came, from the United States, within a week. Waterstone's and WH Smith don't even have the book listed on their catalogue.

But that doesn't exist, does it? We don't have that, no one has ever had that, the greatest states in history have never had that, its just not how people are.

All you seem to really be saying is that you'd like to see the responsibilities of the government put into the hands of the people, which is a fine idea, until you start asking 'well how will this be done?' then it all falls apart. If people could govern themselves in the way you describe, then they would. But they don't, they never have, Government arises out of necessity. 

Isn't it a bit like saying ""I want my class of schoolchildren to be educated without a teacher. They will just walk into the school, go to the library, and learn everyday. They will share their ideas among each other, and progress along until they are all professors of Latin, at which point they leave the school system.""

I mean, one can *imagine* such a scenario, but that doesn't mean it is *possible*. It simply wouldn't happen would it, children don't work that way, people arent like that. Some may learn some things, some may learn some things *well*, but on the whole without any structure from above, the kids will try to get away with doing as little as possible, or go way off track and get confused, or have wildly different or incorrect interpretations of key issues because no one ever corrected them. It just would never work.

I realise this is what the MPAA have been lobbying for, with their ""entertainment tax"".

Corporatism is a blight on society, and presumably what you mean by corporate tyranny. If you remove the government, you create a level playing field for all market participants, removing corporate tyranny.

The European governments of today are the evolved form of 9th century feudalism. Revolutions have occurred, figureheads have been deposed, but the nature of the State has essentially remained the same since the 9th century. Governments have, through popular demand, made concessions to individual liberty over the last millennia. European populations have transitioned from Feudal Serfs to Royal Subjects, then to Democratic Citizens. Each step has resulted in an increase in liberty for the individual and a decrease in power for the rulers.

Can you identify a single instance of a government ""arising"" in the nature you suggest, in the last 100 years? The governments we have today are a continuum of the Feudal system, adapting where required to meet the expectations of their populations on fairness and liberty.

Men are ten times more likely to commit crimes than women. Of course not all men are criminals but this is a clear indication of a behavioural trend within a demographic group.

When searching through news archives for the term ""suicide bombing"", the perpetrators are almost all followers of a certain religion. Furthermore, perpetrators of honor killings, tend to be followers of certain religions, far more than others. You'd be hard-pressed to find an honor killing that was influenced by the teachings of Jainism, for example.

I'm yet to see anyone murdered over a cartoon making fun of Buddha. Yet every a picture of Momhammed is published in a magazine we see savage worldwide violence and more often than not, killings. This is clearly indicative of a behavioural tendency within a group of people.

Followers who claim the Qu'ran as their holy book, evidently exhibit behavioural trends. Wether their behaviour is directly influenced by the book would be harder to quantify, though almost every atrocity committed in the name of religion is followed by a citation of chapter and verse as a means of justification",0,1351892809,null,0,1351894173,0,c6vibfh,t3_12i928,t1_c6vibfh,t1_c6vcwiv,null,1430304373,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Perhaps this is true. It's probably true that a free society would be a dangerous one.

But for people like me, sacrificing some safety to live freely is an acceptable consequence. I'd rather take my chances with roving bandits than live in fear of my Government breaking down my door at dawn and dragging me away from my family, for posting a joke on Twitter.

&gt;I don't like eminent domain either; but I'd rather have the current system with eminent domain a part of it than the idea that everyone is going to give to charity and that will somehow replace the safety net of social services/welfare/medical system/critical national infrastructure/etc.

I am very realistic about the feasibility of my political system. We're talking probably 400 years until something like this could be realised on a global scale. It requires people more or less universally to acknowledge the coercion and violence involved in current governance, and to consider it to be abhorrent. It requires people to be compassionate enough to be charitable, and it requires people to value individual liberty. It's a long road but I'm deeply confident and hopeful. :)

I'm not denying anything you've said regarding the koran and hafiz. That is the whole point. People can always point to the scripture and argue over meanings, so it's pretty much irrelevant to me whether you think it says X because someone else might think it says Z ad infinitum. This is why I don't care to read into the koran or any religious text for that matter. What has my understanding got to do with it?

My view is pragmatic, I see the end result and I deduce that there is something wrong with the source.

Everything about your descision to buy that coke will boil down to social pressure created by their marketing team, subsconcious brand associations built by the constant barricade of the company logo and the manufactured ""happiness"" image you can't walk anywhere in the world without noticing and obviously the addictive properties of the drink itself. What Coke are doing with the sale of every good is taking advantage of our primate instant gratification complex at the expense of our long term health and our wallets. They add absolutely nothing, and amount to a complete waste of resources that would be better on pretty much anything in the public sector. 

Capitalism works in a way where wealth will eventually flow to a small percentage of the population and leave a huge underclass and a glass ceiling for minorities. It doesn't matter if the state is involved or not -- a few people which have the resources to start a successful enterprises, will expand and seize control of barriers to entry for other firms, pass down this wealth to their children and you'll eventually have a situation like in the industrial revolution, where the majority of people have no choice other than to work spine splitting hours in a monotonous field with barely enough to keep them alive. The Capitalist will have far more control over their workers than a king his subjects and people will start questioning why they are going through this level of degradation for a suposed liberty that is beyond relevance to them. 

The point being that force does exist, though indirect in Capitalism.

**Edit:** Apparently 50/50 for the squad v Tottenham.

I'm not really sure what Roberto's plans for him are, though. Personally, I'd love to see more of him, because when he has played, I found he added a lot to our squad - especially when we needed some impact at the end of a game... Like the Fulham match. (Kinda like Walcott was for England in the euros)

I understand your frustration though (I've been having a peek at the Arsenal subreddit) - I'd love for him to play, and I know you guys want that for him, because it's the whole point of him being on loan.

I honestly couldn't say though. Right now, Maloney seems to be in great form and Koné and Di Santo are making a great partnership. 

The honest to god, most I (personally) can see him being played at the moment (when he's not injured) is as either an ""impact sub"" or if one of our forwards is injured/tired/whatever.

I would have loved for him to play in the Capital one match the other day, but unfortunately not :( - and I really mean that because I think he could have been the difference we needed to break through.

He could very well work out like Maloney did for us last year. Martinez let him settle in for a few months before he played. When he did, he became a major part of the squad that ended the season on a high.

**TL;DR**: I have no idea. I think he's great, but I don't know how he fits into Roberto's plans/our squad right now.

**Random Fact:** He sang ""we will rock you"" in front of the team when he arrived and he also goes shopping with Ali Al-Habsi.

The implication at present is that the ""political figure"" in question is still alive, however this recent Daily Mail article (above) names a deceased politician and makes insinuations about another as-yet-unnamed dead politician ALSO being involved.

There have been strong insinuations throughout the media for some time about not just the North Wales case but a Jersey care home and an Irish care home which all remain unproved (and potentially unprovable).

To be honest, this sort of attitude is why these crimes do not emerge. It's not some shadowy paedo ring running everything behind the scenes. It's that everyone assumes that things are being pursued. Vulnerable people don't think they will be believed, and even if they are credible and go to the police, they are treated with contempt. If the prosecution is to go ahead, it has to go through a whole chain of authority, and it only takes one person in the chain to be chary of stepping on the toes of powerful people, and the process fails.

I'm sure what you are going to fail to understand here is that I'm not seeking to protect any religion  here. In fact I'm of the firm belief that the world would be better off with out it for any number of reasons. What I'm doing is objecting to sloppy thinking the clouds the actual issues and how people stop bothering to think of people as *people* in  these situations that almost always misses the point.

We can't have a proper conversation about the role of religion when people on both sides of the argument are using it as an excuse to avoid talking and thinking about the *people* rather than any of the endless books or creeds that can be made to dance to what ever tune is convenient for people at the time. 

In this case there is nothing at all that I can find that means the poor boy had a duty to be able to do what his mother wanted. None. And nothing that means she had to beat him when he failed. This is a sad case of an unhinged parent who was disappointed that her child did not live up to standards that where clearly unreasonable for the child and not demanded by their faith. The faith is only so much set dressing to the core issues here as should be clear by the fact the only defence the mother has is that the devil told her to do it. 

But no, lets ignore that and lets have another pointless conversation based on crappy logic and use the poor boys death to attack Islam... the same counter productive shit as always. It almost like people who can't admit to them self's they are simply just a bit racist need to use their finger paint understanding of a religion they associate with a group of people they don't like as an excuse to give them self's permission to be a little bit racist.

I really don't want to see this happening, but I think it's likely to end this way. I think the same happens with local elections too.

I read through the blurbs on that website but they're hollow. Followed some of the website links, the conservative candidate has some shitty link to a party poker spam website on his pages. The labour candidate's website is much better, but it's the same hollow promises no one seems to be talking about how they're going to achieve the things their promising. The independant candidate has a surprisingly good website but offers nothing more than ""I will be good vote for me""

Anyway, after farting around on those websites for a while I sent each a message with some questions.

After Hitler had annihilated the Jews and the Nazis, who would have been his next target to ""purify"" the ""super race"" he was ""creating""?!


Recently we have seen political controversy over Afghanistan and Iraq. However, if you read up on some of the things the Taliban do to their own people...

Innocent people die - that's the nature of war.
The poppy remembers them too - yes primarily soldiers, but also the civilians.

Ever been to the National Memorial Arboretum in Lichfield? It has a sculpture, featuring a wounded soldier on a stretcher, being carried by two other soldiers, with a wife and child to the side visibly distressed

At 1100, on 11/11, the sun falls through the cracks of the memorial not on the soldier, not on the casualty, but on the woman and child who were left behind - THEY are also the casualties of war.


I will always wear a poppy and attend remembrance. I think it's appalling to call poppy wearing a ""fad"" - if anyone needs to review their decisions, it should be YOU for NOT wearing the poppy.

Secondly, funny that you bring up Somalia. According to UN and other government organizations the standard of living for Somalians has actually increased since the government collapse.

They are, according to other governments, more economically productive and peaceful than when they were waring over which group gets to control the state:
__________________________________________

&gt;For the warlord objection to work, the statist would need to argue that a given community would remain lawful under a government, but that the same community would break down into continuous warfare if all legal and military services were privatized. The popular case of Somalia, therefore, helps neither side.[i] It is true that Rothbardians should be somewhat disturbed that the respect for non-aggression is apparently too rare in Somalia to foster the spontaneous emergence of a totally free market community. But by the same token, the respect for “the law” was also too weak to allow the original [Somali government to maintain order.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Somalia#Somali_Civil_War)

Because they know what answer we'll give, and it won't be the ""right"" one.

* The current Government don't dare ask about the EU because they saw what happened with the AV vote, and it could put the Government in a really awkward position of having to explain why they are going to ignore a referendum by not leaving the EU (which is awesome).
* Scottish Independence is going to be voted on, but the SNP have to put it off for as long as possible because when the vote fails, the SNP will kind of cease to have a mandate (and it will be clear they only exist because everyone hates the Tories, and many people hate Labour).
* Bailing out financial institutions is also going to be problematic because, again, the public are likely to vote against the way those in power want. Additionally, referenda take a while to plan, and bailing out banks tends to need to be done at fairly short notice.

I'm not saying every junkie is a misunderstood botanist, I'm not saying every gardener is a smack baron in disguise - but while this disparity between plant and drug prevails, we can never look after our poorly and never save our soldiers from a bleak death....

I just think the poppy is a very ironic, darkly ironic, millions of dead people ironic sentiment, toward something which is basically saying let's not kill each other por have people all die and suffer and shit anymore.

A poppy could represent love, or it could represent war, or it could represent a junkie dream....

Locke deals with these issues, or at least attempts to. He denies that being born in a society contracts one to that society. He also distinguishes between explicit and tacit consent.

The argument for why you're accepting a social contract goes along the lines of: you haven't left/moved away to start your own society/commonwealth &amp; you're enjoying the benefits of society you're living in, so you're tacitly consenting to the rules of that society. As such, you're obligated to abide by its rules.

Thus, the lack of giving expressed consent is not a knock down argument against social contracts. Now, you might argue that tacit consent is a poorly formed concept, that it can't generate the obligations that it needs, or that explicit consent is not possible to give, but you'd need to come up with those arguments.

Second, while I'm not sure if there's an actual judicial system which accepts forced singing of contracts to be valid, Hobbes did think that any contracts entered into fear are valid as one still had a choice (e.g. you do have a choice not to pay your taxes.

I don't think he even really wants the adventure; he just wants a simple life with Amy, but adventuring with her is the closest he can get. In addition, his ""You're turning me into you!"" line from *The Girl Who Waited* demonstrates a complex understanding of what the Doctor is morally, free from illusion.

That lets him offer a far less common perspective for a companion and, strangely enough, I think this makes him come off almost like a peer to the Doctor. He's not as capable, obviously, but his immunity to illusion brings him a lot closer than most. Maybe a better way of putting it is that I think he comes off a bit more ""adult"" than most, more adult than even the older companions of the past.

However, in the last few years, I've been feeling quite uncomfortable about the whole thing - not with the symbol itself, or what it represents, but with numbering myself amongst the others who wear a poppy, for reasons that I do not agree with. It seems that the vast majority of people, and particularly those doing all the advertising and publicity, are massively missing the point. In fact, they are turning the poppy into a symbol of sometthign that is antithetical to its original purpose.

Remembrance Sunday isn't about how great our military is, and how they are all heroes. It isn't about supporting the nation/wars/soldiers. It isn't about shallow jingoism.

You can have the other 364 days to talk about how great it is that we are British, and how awesome we are, and how cool explosions look. You can support the troops as much as you want, all you want, on every other day.  

On this one day out of the year though, we shouldn't be banging drums, and cheering, and indiscriminately declaring people heroes. 

It is supposed to be the day when we look back at the at the dreadful cost of war, and remind ourselves that this is not a toll lightly to be paid. It is supposed to be a day when we remember the serried ranks of dead, entire generations butchered and burned. Its the day when we remember that war may sometimes be a necessary evil, but it is always an evil, and that ideally, we never want to sacrifice so many again.

Remembrance Day is not for glorifying the living, but for mourning the dead. 

A lot of people seem to forget that, or to disagree, and I find it rather sickening that what should be a day to remember the horrors of war is becoming a day to foment approval for new bloodshed.

In reality the number people in extreme poverty has fallen *globally* by 20%, this isn't a miracle of anarchism.

true,87liyamu,uk,North-East Derbyshire,"The reason a lot of the promises seem ""hollow"" is because the office they're running for is ill-defined. Nobody's quite sure of how much power these elected Police and Crime Commissioners will have. That includes not just the public, but also the candidates themselves, the Home Office, and the MPs who voted on [the legislation that created this role](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/13/section/1/enacted).

The position is a compromise. Under the previous system, police forces were answerable to the Chief Constable. The Chief Constable, since 1839, has been variously appointed by Justices of the Peace, Magistrates, the Home Secretary, or people within the Police Force. The entire system was deemed to be opaque and undemocratic, because the public never had any say in who would hold this very important office.

So both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats set out to democratise policing. If the police are doing a bad job, then somebody needs to be punished. The phrase that comes up over and over again is ""held to account"". But holding elections for the position of Chief Constable would be a very unpopular decision. It'd be seen as politicians meddling directly in the very complex affairs of policing.

The compromise is the Police and Crime Commissioner. As an elected position, it's hoped that the holders of this office will react to what the citizens want, and work to ensure that the public get the kind of policing that they want.

The Home Office has a web page outlining the [Role of the PCC](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/police/police-crime-commissioners/public/what-is-pcc/role/), and page 4 of the [Home Office Public Awareness Campaign Partner Briefing (.pdf)](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/police/pcc/campaign-resources/campaign-briefing?view=Binary) explains that

&gt;* A police and crime commissioner’s job will be to 
oversee the police and ensure they prioritise 
what matters most to you
* Police and crime commissioners won’t tell the 
police how to do their job, but they will be 
involved in setting their priorities 
* Police and crime commissioners will ensure 
money is spent where it matters most

What isn't explained anywhere is **how** the PCCs will hold the police forces to account. If a force is performing badly, the PCC doesn't have the power to sack the Chief Constable. If a Chief Constable doesn't have the same priorities, the PCC doesn't have the power to tell the Chief Constable what to do.

Apart from controlling how money is spent in the police force, the PCC is powerless. And when it comes to deciding how much funding is allocated to each area of policing, the PCC is caught in a very nasty trap. Agreeing with the Chief Constable means nothing changes. Disagree, and suddenly the entire process of policing gets snared in politics, and the PCC is the only one that can lose their job.

The role of the PCC ultimately comes down to

* Take credit when things are going well
* Take the blame when they're not
* Be replaced by another powerless PCC

And the whole point of this is theatre. When things go wrong, people need someone they can punish. Government needs to be able to point at someone and say ""it's his fault, and it's your fault for electing him"". All the while, the actual process of policing remains unchanged.

What? No it isn't. I need more than someone saying ""Stand Up for Victims, Vulnerable People, and Take Seriously Domestic Abuse"" It means nothing. Who the hell is approaching this job thinking this kind of stuff doesn't matter? 

&gt;And no, I've based my decision (though I AM still reading the other candidates so it isn't final yet) on the website we're both assumedly looking at. Howard's statement displays that he understands budgeting and finances, that he's been involved in various local communities for a long time and understands how they work, that he has significant experience in law, and that he's not interested in letting wider political issues and battles interfere or clash with the demands of the job at hand.

Sure, you might look at someone's CV and asses their ability to be able to budget.

His other responsibilities include:

determine local policing priorities

commission policing services from the chief constable

and he doesn't appear to mention how he's going to handle these.

What happens if you vote for him, and then it turns out that his priority is going to be chasing drug users and locking them up (replace with a position you disagree with) What then?

His blurb on the choosemypcc.org.uk website reads like someone who's applying for the position of accountant. Now that appears to be quite important in this roll, diverting funds to certain areas is going to play a part in his prioritisation. Which is something that he hasn't made obvious where his priority's lie. In this specific case choosemypcc.org.uk is obviously not providing the information required to make an informed decision.

We need to have a system like that so taxes can be collected to run the society. It is an undeniable fact that we are currently living in a society that exists in the state of greatest freedom and prosperity it has ever known. And the reason for that is because, as a society, we are able to pool our resourses and impliment policies that it would be impossible to accomplish on an individual level.

EDIT: Yep, actually, in the United Kingdom invalid votes are not just counted, but scrupulously categorized too, in every constituency.

a) want of official mark

b) voting more than once

&gt;The drugs trade is a capitalistic free market that flourishes in spite of government's attempts to control it.

A capitalist free market is an oxymoron, capitalist markets are essentially unfree.  To the extent that something is a free market it's anti-capitalist.  States the world over have been heavily involved in the drug trade (from the British smashing open China's opium markets by force, to the Americans' involvement in heroin and coke in Indochina, Latin America and Afghanistan).",0,1351908562,null,0,false,0,c6vm1zg,t3_12ip66,t1_c6vm1zg,t1_c6vj2wn,null,1430306154,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Sure, sure, I get that, I was just responding to the not being counted at all bit.

In Russia, until just a couple years ago, the ballot actually featured an ""Against All"" option, which usually got a couple of percentage points' worth of votes. The law was such that if Against All got more votes than any actual individual candidate, the elections had to be redone. (I'm not sure if the same candidates could run again.) This barely ever happened of course, until it did, in one or two cases of races for some local official or other, and soon after that Putin abolished the option.

Another place where they still have a None of the Above option is the state of Nevada, strangely enough. Ah, [I actually wrote about all of this on another website, years ago](http://able2know.org/topic/71605-1) ... turns out the Russians abolished the Against All option in 2006, six years ago already (time flies).

Bent double, like old beggars under sacks, 

Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, 

Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs
 
And towards our distant rest began to trudge. 

Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots 

But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind; 

Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots  

Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.

Gas! Gas! Quick, boys! – An ecstasy of fumbling, 

Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time; 

But someone still was yelling out and stumbling, 

And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime . . . 

Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light, 

As under a green sea, I saw him drowning. 

In all my dreams, before my helpless sight, 

He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. 

If in some smothering dreams you too could pace 

Behind the wagon that we flung him in, 

And watch the white eyes writhing in his face, 

His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin; 

If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood 

Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, 

Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud 

Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues, 

My friend, you would not tell with such high zest  

To children ardent for some desperate glory, 

The old Lie; Dulce et Decorum est 

Pro patria mori.

The Nazi party didn't have hard boundaries, it was an idea, one shared by industrialists and financiers in the UK and America. Eugenics was implemented first in the US and arguably continues to this day if you look at the prison population. Fascism won and the situation could hardly have gone worse. We have been on the edge of nuclear war for a long time, and we have at least a few Russians to thank for it not happening. One incident involved three Russian subs off the coast of Cuba told that should all three commanders agree they could launch an attack. US boats started dropping depth charges and outside of radio they were under the orders that if they all agreed they could launch nukes. Two thought that war had started and wanted to launch, [Vasili Arkhipov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasili_Arkhipov) said no. We have been that close an unknown number of times.

Remember what Germany did? They invaded about four countries before the war started, and the Jewish issue came at the end of the war and makes strange economic sense if it happened like we are lead to believe. What have America done? If we ignore the millions killed by direct US aggression and CIA backed coups, they are currently occupying Libya, Egypt, Iraq, Afghanistan, and are at low level clandestine war with Pakistan and Iran. Israel is an apartheid state. The UK is an accessory, whilst harbouring some of the more significant financial terrorists and money laundering systems. The middle east from being on a comparable level social progress to the west (health care, woman's rights, education, etc) was in large parts knocked back to the stone age. Africa has been a hideous mess when we think of past and present day South Africa. There has been all manner of genocidal events, and America's middle eastern war games seem to be heading south. Indonesia doesn't fare better.

In many ways the wars of the 20th century have yet to end because fascist authoritarian militantism still is here. And we see it at home with secret courts, corporate lobbying, failure to properly police high level crime including hacking, expenses, and now a pedophile ring that probably includes aristocracy if not royalty and high members of the church (previously ""isolated"" to Ireland, now Mainland UK).

But in some ways this is not just about paedophiles, it's about the vulnerable and the powerful, as with phone hacking, as with Hillsborough, as with Bloody Sunday.

[Here's the Nick Davies story about this in 1997](http://www.nickdavies.net/1997/10/01/secrecy-imposed-on-the-exposure-of-alleged-child-abuse-news-and-feature/) (and it wasn't a great surprise to discover this is the same journalist who almost single handedly exposed phone hacking). He lists the son of a peer, two social workers, two police officers, an executive with a local authority, a powerful public official, a senior probation officer and a director of a major company. The son of the peer admitted to having underage sex with a care home child, and even got him convicted of theft on that basis, the public official has six separate witnesses implicating him. How is it possible that these people have not been prosecuted? In fact, not only were they not prosecuted, they were granted anonymity by the investigating Judge. This is a gross miscarriage of the course of justice. It's not only that these are children that are unable to consent because they were too young, but that the perpetrators were leveraging their privileged positions within society to add even more coercion, and preying on people who had nowhere else to go, who had no freedom of movement, no support structure, who would be pursued by the authorities if they ran away, literally the most vulnerable people in the country. It is not acceptable to just hold up your hands and give the perpetrators amnesty.

These are the occasions when thinking people in society have to be serious, and make sure that the victims are taken care of, and given proper justice, and also to be able to shape the response so that it doesn't go rampaging after paediatricians or people who look a bit odd.",0,1351915100,null,0,false,0,c6vngwj,t3_12jg9b,t1_c6vngwj,t3_12jg9b,null,1430306821,28,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,28

The problem now is that every episode is nearly the same:

Arthur is in trouble, Merlin gets emo and warns Arthur, Arthur makes light banter about Merlin worrying too much, Merlin saves Arthur.

There seems to be a real lack of character and plot development.

Indeed.  [Michael Parenti](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Bc4KJx2Ao) is very good on the roots of fascism in Western capitalism, and we can see a similar thing happening today in parts of Southern Europe.  (I'd love to know where some of the funding for Golden Dawn is coming from, for example, I know they're partly self-funding, but there's seed money from somewhere there too).  

He's also very good on [the origins of ""the good war"" (WWII)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9Lievywdoo).

&gt;Eugenics was implemented first in the US and arguably continues to this day if you look at the prison population.

Hitler was very effusive in his praise of America in the early years and specifically said he was copying some of his eugenics policies from them.  He also tried quite hard not to antagonise them before it became inevitable.

As for the US prison population, if you tie it up properly with the war on blacks and the war on drugs, you can see that, as a number of others have argued, basically slavery in the US only underwent a brief hiatus for a short period when the industrial capitalists of the North beat the agrarian slave owners of the South.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Can you identify a single instance of a government ""arising"" in the nature you suggest, in the last 100 years? The governments we have today are a continuum of the Feudal system, adapting where required to meet the expectations of their populations on fairness and liberty.

In every African conflict where rebels took over a certain area, after a brief moment of anarchy, a governmental structure arised (this is even true for Somalia but on the form of warlords). There is not a single country in the history of the world anarchy was ever a sustainable alternative to a governmental system.

&gt;The European governments of today are the evolved form of 9th century feudalism. Revolutions have occurred, figureheads have been deposed, but the nature of the State has essentially remained the same since the 9th century. Governments have, through popular demand, made concessions to individual liberty over the last millennia. European populations have transitioned from Feudal Serfs to Royal Subjects, then to Democratic Citizens. Each step has resulted in an increase in liberty for the individual and a decrease in power for the rulers.

This is only partially true. While it is true that in part of the reformation and the enlightment _civil liberties_ have indeed vastly increased, economocial liberties only to a degree. The amount of regulations, while being decreased in the last two decades in part of the neoliberal policies, has grown vastly in the last century, as has the amount of taxes you have to pay for the state. Today we are witnessing a new form of mercantalism in the form of state capitalism rising and in the current crisis we are seeing the European countries moving towards are more centralized and planned economic model (we are in the process of establishing a european banking supervision authority)

Opinion polls would suggest that it's quite possible for people to believe the SNP offer the best policies and governance for Scotland, but also not be in favour of independence, so I don't think they'll cease to have a mandate if they lose. Clearly lots and lots of people voted for them in 2010 who don't (yet) favour independence. I think they're quite likely to split into left and right in the event of a yes vote though. 

You're right about the Tories, but I think the reason Labour have lost so much ground in Scotland is just a reflection of their shift to the right. Plus their leadership in Scotland is a joke. 

The problem for Scottish Labour is that it's hamstrung by its Westminster parent. Politically speaking, the best thing the party in Scotland could do would be to divorce itself from London (interestingly, a candidate for the Tory leadership in Scotland suggested his party do exactly that for the same reason). If Scottish Labour came out against Trident, was in favour of keeping university tuition free, free prescriptions, and free personal care for the elderly - and got rid of the lamentable Johann Lamont - I think it could take back much of the ground it's lost to the SNP, since those are all very popular policies. But it can't do any of those things because Labour policy is decided at a UK level, and what's politically popular in England is not the same as Scotland - hence the entire independence debate in the first place.

true,brumguvnor,null,null,"OK: first advice would be to go for [Pritchatt's Park](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/students/accommodation/halls/pritchatts.aspx), [Selly Oak village](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/students/accommodation/halls/sellyoak.aspx) or the [Vale](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/students/accommodation/halls/vale.aspx): the rest of the areas listed on the main [accommodation page](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/students/accommodation/halls/index.aspx) are all good - but they are not owned by the University and they are all more of a walk away.

Of these:

**- the Vale** is absolutely huge: a lot of accommodation and students and it's own bars, restaurants and cafes: it is the biggest concentration of University owned accommodation.  It is a good 15 minute walk away though

**- Pritchatts Park** also has a lot of students and it's own social centre and is on the same side of the Uni as the Vale

**- Selly Oak village** is insanely close: just across the main road from the Uni and on the main road that you would get a bus or taxi into the city centre on - and therefore on the oppposite side of the Uni from the Vale and Pritchatts

Most accommodation is shared kitchen and most of it is now en suite bathroom instead of shared.

Also don't forget the dedicated [postgrad accommodation page](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/students/accommodation/pg-accommodation.aspx) - they mention Mansion House and Metchley Brook: these are fine for studio apartments, just quite small in terms of how many students are there in one place: if you want a more studenty experience then get an en-suite room in a flat run by the Uni at one of the above.

By personal preference I would go to the Vale... - probably in Mason Hall if you can get it as it is the most modern and recently completed of the blocks and overlooks the lake.  The main [University map](http://www.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=http:%2F%2Fwww.google.co.uk%2Fmaps%2Fms%3Fie%3DUTF8%26hl%3Den%26vps%3D1%26jsv%3D286b%26oe%3DUTF8%26msa%3D0%26msid%3D105040065901173058294.00048c979e118f268c5a7%26output%3Dkml&amp;sll=52.450674,-1.930826&amp;sspn=0.009703,0.027788&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=k&amp;z=15) now has all of the accommodation locations entered onto it.

true,Kim147,uk,British Sandgroper,"Well there's all sorts of tips but that's a long time of experience . However :-

* the industry goes through changes but also makes the same mistakes . Bad software engineering - bad architectural design - costs many companies mega bucks and a lot of companies are paying for it heavily at the moment . A lot of them are loath to redesign from scratch despite the money that it would ultimately save them - they have an investment to 'protect' . If the code is not too bad it can be made over - evolved - however if it is too bad it ultimately has to be dumped - the project just grinds to a halt - too much dangerous code - very difficult to update and bug fix without creating side effects .

* short term contracts used to be common in the UK - people resourced for specific projects . A recent practice has been to give out a longer term contract and then to cut it short once the work has been done . However the economy is improving so this might be changing for the better .

* Continental contracts are long term contracts usually - they are the client cheating on \ avoiding the Social Chapter ( EU regulations ) . If you work more than 183 days in most Continental EU countries you fall under the 183 day rule and have to work it via an umbrella company - your costs more than double - ~43% . However Continental rates have been pushed down - it's often not worth working Continental contracts .

* as a contractor you are a business person - be useful to your clients , work with them , hit the ground running , produce the results , always look at it from their point of view . Understand that they may not be perfect , they may even be destroying themselves , however they are your customer in the first instance and the customer is always right .

* your code should be well constructed , neatly laid out - using good coding standards , easy to read and follow , and it should replicate the real world - think objects , linked lists \ trees and their relation to XML files for example .

* the industry in Britain is spread throughout the country but there are concentrations - M4 &amp; M3 corridors , Cambridge , Reading &amp; Swindon . There are also specialities - a lot of Set Top Box work and mobile phone work , but there is also a lot of general embedded work . Cambridge has it's own particular peculiarities .

* good morality and ethics - always doing the right thing - goes a long way . Being professional is very important .

* agencies \ agents have tricks such as - i) asking where you are currently , ii) asking for references (often not actually needed) etc. - these are to get client contacts . Agents can waste a lot of your time on the phone - keep it polite but short when on contracts . Get a good reputation - if the agent is confident that they can put you into a contract without any problems and with good results they will go for you . Avoid the agents who spam - sending out many unsuitable and non specifically targeted job spec.'s - they are not paying much attention to you \ doing proper matching . Always ask for a job spec. first - if they have a live job they will send it to you , if not - they are just fishing or trying to poach . Also - what people \ clients hate is spamming - phone calls \ email etc. - and if you can ensure that your agents don't piss off your clients you will be in their good books .

* register a company &amp; register for VAT , or work via an umbrella company . Company registration is simple and quick and you pay less tax . You can also register it to a redirection address - allows you to move around .

* I would certainly recommend visiting \ working on the Continent - I have done 5 contracts there . Continental Europe is different than Anglo land in many respects but you will find a lot of commonalities between Kiwi land \ Oz and Continental Europe - it's a great approach and life style there . Except the EU which is rather bloated and destroying it's current incarnation at the moment - nothing to worry too much providing you read up on what is happening and take precautions .

true,nowonmai666,lfc99,null,"I think Liverpool have done Carroll a massive injustice by buying him in and then putting him in a team that doesn't play to his strengths.

Carroll is arguably the best target man in the world, and he's young and still improving. He deserves to be in a team that plays around a target man: working with Allardyce is the best possible thing he could have for his development right now; he'll learn all the dark arts from that man.

Give it 5 years, and Carroll will be the new Drogba, with a major team built around him.

But Liverpool have no use for him. Under Kenny, it as clear that Bellamy was the *only* player in the entire squad who knew how to play off a target man, and Gerrard was the only player with the nous to hit the early, raking crosses that Carroll loves so much. Even that has happened more often for England than Liverpool.

And then our new manager is building a team that has no place for the skills Carroll excels in. (And anyone who talks about wanting a ""different option"" on the bench has no understanding of football, and yes that seems to include most journalists and pundits, but it's one of the stupidest things I've ever heard).

If he didn't like it, perhaps he should have said that he wasn't hypnotised..

Personally, I feel more European. This might be because I study a couple of European languages, and the culture has always interested me, but my own political views lean towards staying in Europe.

It's more fiscal conservatives who don't like the EU. They treat it with mistrust and suspicion because it controls some of the UK's finances and they don't get a say in how that money is spent. It's understandable I suppose, but I believe the benefits of the EU outweigh the cons.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well, there are a number of reasons, and by the nature of the question I have to make sweeping generalisations, so I will.

Firstly, politically. US democrats would be considered a very right wing party here in Europe. Most major European parties are fairly similar, and things like the welfare state, socialised medicine are taken as a given, not so in the US. I don't know the exact gun laws in Germany but I'm fairly sure you cannot walk around carrying a concealed weapon like you can in some US states. It's things like this that you maybe don't consider but are actually a completely different way of thinking. The same goes for European views on personal liberty. Forcing facebook to stop using facial recognition software, that is what I would call a European libertarian standpoint, whereas in the US libertarians are more interested in minimising the govenment involvement in their lives, as opposed to using the government to protect them.

Socially, I feel I can relate to Europeans a lot better. An example I would use is skiing. Apres ski is a huge part of ski culture in Europe, whenever I go skiing in the US the resorts are generally pretty dead in the evenings, there is none of the famous Austrian foot stomping, alcohol in general is seen as a bad thing and I find Americans in genreal have a fairly immature attitude to alcohol (rich coming from the binge drinkers of Europe I know!) but the fact that they can't drink until 21 means that for me anyway I've rarely met somebody that can go drinking until the early hours and behave sensibly, but again the Brits are pretty terrible for that.

So, in general, whilst on the surface it may seem like the Brits are a lot closer to the US due to the common language I would say that due to our common political values and the fact we've been living next door for so long, I certainly relate better to Europeans than I do to our American cousins",0,1351940232,null,0,1351943165,0,c6vqqla,t3_12k40j,t1_c6vqqla,t1_c6vqelb,null,1430308363,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

I go often to the USA and to the Mainland for work and for recreation and find that Europe is more comprehensible even if my German is terrible. In America I understand everything everyone says and agree with very little of it (even though I like the US, like Americans and admire many things about the country), and in Europe I have to work hard to understand anything anyone says but probably will mostly agree with it. 

Although the USA was founded by people who thought of themselves as British and fought a revolution to secure what they thought of as the rights a British person should have, the politics of the US and the UK have diverged enormously over the last 240 years—as one would expect. The UK now is pretty close to the “Christian Democrat” mainstream in Europe, although our wonky electoral system gives power to more extreme minority parties like the Conservatives. And recent governments have been held to ransom by the Right Libertarian bankers.

But in the US the mainstream is far to the right socially and economically in ways that seem strange to us Brits and to you Mainlanders. Americans equate economic success with moral virtue in a way that I think makes little sense to the British and less to Europeans. American public policy is morally coercive in all sorts of ways that make no sense to Brits or Europeans. Plenty of European countries (including the UK) have problems with race here and there but the US is still a racist country deep in its bones.

While I love many aspects of America I can't imagine living there. Socially it seems far too conservative, aggressive and if you're not in one of the small liberal enclaves incredibly dull and provincial. This is a perspective created by American media.

In Europe I may be the stereotypical monolingual Brit but having spent time working in Spain, Portugal, The Netherlands, Austria and Italy I feel comfortable and could imagine living in Northern or Western Europe. The Netherlands was one of my favourite places to work as apart from the directness everyone was very British. There was a good work ethic but also a real sense of humour and a level of sarcasm and informality that made working there really easy.

European political systems feel more natural as like Britain many have some form of pointless Monarch and a system which works around centuries of tradition.

Personally, I feel equally culturally affiliated with both sides. America has the language, and the UK's economy seems to have taken a lot from America. However, they have a propensity to be blindly patriotic, religious and zealous about everything else they like. 

As for Europe, we share a similar political system and society, but I think we're reluctant to get involved in the bickering that goes on in the Eurozone, and Brits aren't particularly good at multiculturalism these days, which is a crying shame when you're trying to unite a continent under a single flag. 

You have to bear in mind that the UK is a cultural combination of many cultural sources. We've been settled by the Celts and the early Germanic people, and we've been militarily invaded by Romans (three times), Normans, French more times that I can be bothered to count, Spanish, Dutch, and the Germans've given it another go a few more times. We also have large immigrant populations from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Jamaica and South Africa, to name a few groups not on the two (sub)continents.

BUT, we've given a lot to America. They speak English (poorly) for a reason. I'm not going to go as far as to say that England made America, that's a gross over-generalisation, they're almost as culturally diverse as the UK (baring romans and celts, adding Natives), but at the time of the colonisation, the UK was a big power in the world; at the peak of the empire, a fifth of the world was under the remit of the monarchy.

Basically expect to pay 18% to 20% corporation tax above ~10K in the UK ( paying yourself a small tax free salary also helps ) - you can sort this all out yourself or use an accountant . On the Continent the taxes ( state , local , health , retirement ) and charges ( umbrella company and salary ( 2 charges ) ) amount to ~43% . Often , these days , when you work out the net it can be less than a UK contract . However for yourself - a person on a working holiday - it's probably just best to get the job and enjoy it .

EU Schengen country visas cover all countries in the Schengen region and they are separate from the UK - obtain from any Schengen country .

In the UK ( including Continental contracts &lt; 183 days ) you , or your umbrella company , bills the agency for the gross ( rate x hours ) plus VAT . This is then paid into your company account . Some agencies delay payment for a month - taking the piss a bit ( my current agency does this ) .

I agree with you - I'm sure those policies would get widespread support in England amongst people - but as you say, since you have FPTP, and winning Westminster is about winning England's middle class, they're not going to get representation by anyone with designs on actual government since middle England tends to be conservative and doesn't want to pay for ""scroungers"" like the young, poor people, or the elderly.

To start with, all this talk of leaving the union is absolute rubbish and I'd hope they nip it in the bud soon. It's not perfect but we need the union, and as America loses its dominance on the world stage we need to strengthen ties with Europe.
It is only in recent years that I've started to affiliate myself as European, largely through actually studying the union and realising just quite how deep in we are. I like the cultures, the ability to travel, the huge leading strides in human rights that the EU has taken. But at the same time, economically it's a burden and from a sovereignty perspective I can understand the reservations.

With America, it's my perception that most Brits don't actually like America. It's swiftly moving away from the image of ""the land of the free"" where anything is possible, and looking to become an unpredictable and often extreme ally. It's like your drunk friend, the first few times he got in a fight you had his back, but when you started to realise that he seems to be getting in more and more you stop and think ""Maybe this guy is the issue?""
This sounds quite negative, I like America as a country, I feel closer and easier able to relate to its people. But its politics I cannot stand, and I would be interested to see if Romney does get elected the ramifications that will have for UK relations. I like Obama and I think the relationship can be maintained whilst he holds power, I am concerned that Romney will not be able to hold up relations and the UK will be left without America OR the EU, that'd be a right pickle.",0,1351943291,null,0,false,0,c6vqytp,t3_12k40j,t1_c6vqytp,t3_12k40j,null,1430308470,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Then we have the British Empire, which makes my previous comment seem invalid, but people have to realise that we took over those countries not for some 'greater good' (though we did use this excuse later on) but for our own wealth and profit.

Now, when we talk about 'Europe' most British people think of Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece and the smaller countries such as Austria, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands and to some extent the Scandinavian countries. I think we see Ireland as more of a neighbour and less as European.

Another thing to realise is the United Kingdom is the most multicultural country in Europe meaning our cultural is a lot more diverse than any European country or America, we have a habit of taking the best bits of other peoples culture and adapting it to suit us - take the classic Indian takeout for example.

So no, we don't closely ally ourself with America or Europe - we are our own people, with our own idiosyncrasies - but I like that.

For starters you have a (fairly) unique house and unique room, rather than a carbon copy of everyone else's you have in halls. Halls felt like I was renting out a place to live, having my house with friends in Selly Oak felt like home. 

The drawback with looking into non-university housing is its a lot more hassle - you have to find people to live with, often sort the bills out between you etc, whilst the university owned halls you just apply and they will place you in a corridor/flat with other people and its a lot more straight forward. It does mean you have more control over things with a house though - for example, I wanted self-catered halls but got placed in catered halls, which meant you had to go to the cafeteria for food otherwise you were basically throwing money away.

true,Lakey91,null,null,"It's funny people say that we have more in common with the USA than Europe, and often people are divided between pro-EU and pro-NATO (I know most of Europe is in NATO, but the central and southern countries were often only reluctant members and couldn't be relied upon should the USSR have invaded). It's often also the difference between left and right-wing, for reasons I'll come to. I actually think we have more in common with the Commonwealth than either the EU or the USA. It is the protectionist trade measures against Canada, Australia and India especially that make many self-determinists favour independence over federalism. However there are several other reasons as well.

I think we need to look at exactly what we share with these two states, and question whether we really need to side with one or the other. It is said that the UK is too small a fish to operate independently, but it's clear we can punch way above our weight and that our tethering to the failing European markets over relationships with the Commonwealth and Oriental nations is preventing us from flourishing.

America: We share much with America; it's not surprising actually. The revolution was about a return to Anglo-Saxon values that the colonials feared were lost because of the imposition of a German king (the Hanoverians interfered with politics rather a lot). This is why they rebelled against a 'foreign king'; because he was German, *not* because he was British.

As such, we share a common political ideology; the supremacy of law (both the Monarch and President are indictable); equality under the law; individual freedoms and responsibilities; subsidiarity (that works should be carried out by the smallest, most local body that can effectively get the job done; parliamentary/adversarial democracy; candidate based elections; the Magna Carta etc. This is an awful lot of similarity: the American Constitution took a lot from the unwritten British Constitution and it shows fundamentally.

Neither Britain nor America have ever succumbed to tyranny or autocracy, we have always eschewed political extremism and neither Communists nor Fascists have ever held significant political power in either country. Also important is that the police are considered servants of the people, not servants of the state and any attempt to nationalise the force is looked on with severe suspicion.

The only sticking point between the USA and UK is the USA's consistent attempts throughout history to undermine us. From their attempts to aid France during the Napoleonic wars and their failed invasion of Canada to the unrealistically overvalued debts they saddled us with during the two World Wars (whilst supplying Soviet Russia free of charge); their action during the Suez Crisis and their hissy fit over our refusal to join Vietnam. Even now, Obama says that America has ""no greater friend than France"". Little more than a veiled barb at the 'special relationship'. American politicians have repeatedly shown their disdain for the UK, even when her people consider us their friends. I notice there's a partisan bias however; the Democrats openly dislike the UK, but the Republicans at least try to pretend they like us.

The politics of both countries is important, because one cannot meld different countries with different political systems. The politics of a nation is part the national psyche.

Culturally, we also share a fair amount; we are both Protestant nations and it shows. Our attitudes to sex, relationships and emotion is highly inhibited: witnessing or talking about them in public or seeing them on daytime TV can be quite uncomfortable.

Something like 40% of the Irish people actually live in the UK, and of course Australian and New Zealand citizens are relatively recent migrants and descendants of Brits and Irish. Our cultures are therefore very close, as are our governmental and legal systems.

As for Europe, I see a greater split between Northern and Southern Europe than I do between Britain and Europe as a whole. Britain is undeniably Northern European, a Celtic-Germanic culture although one with a relatively strong French influence. In comparison the Mediterranean cultures are very different.

The US is culturally and genetically German and Spanish as much as it is British and Irish, in places it is also strongly Italian, Scandinavian, and French. In fact in many ways it is more ""European"" than Britain. Europe and America both represent many cultures that are similar, but Britain represents a small subset of these.

What America has done is mix these cultures up in a way that hasn't happened in Europe, while enshrining Germanic ideas about liberty (which we recognise as Anglo-Saxon) in their governmental and legal systems. This latter part makes it very much like the Commonwealth Realms (Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) in some traditional aspects.

One important distinction between Europe and America is that it rejects relatively recent social-democratic concepts that are very common in Europe, which makes it seem very alien to us in some fundamental ways. Britain is perhaps less keen on social-democracy than the rest of Europe, but significantly more so than America.

Beneath the old iron bridges, across the Victorian parks,

&amp; all the frightened people running home before dark,

Past the Saturday morning cinema--

that lies crumbling to the ground,

&amp; the piss stinking shopping centre in the new side of town.

I've come to smell the seasons change, &amp; watch the city,

as the sun goes down again.


Here comes another winter, of long shadows &amp; high hopes,

Here comes another winter, waitin' for utopia,

waitin' for hell to freeze over.

This is the land, where nothing changes,

the land of red buses &amp; blue blooded babies,

This is the place, where pensioners are raped,


&amp; the hearts are being cut, from the welfare state,

Let the poor drink the milk, while the rich eat the honey,

Let the bums count their blessings, while they count the money.


So many people, can't express what's on their minds,

Nobody knows them &amp; nobody ever will,

Until their backs are broken &amp; their dreams are stolen,

&amp; they can't get what they want, then they're gonna get angry!

Well it ain't written in the papers, but its written on the walls

The way this country is divided to fall,

So the cranes are moving on the skyline--

Trying to knock down--this town

But the stains on the heartland, can never be removed,

from this country, that's sick, sad, and confused.

UK scepticism of the EU (which is always conflated with Europe by its acolytes) is less to do with wanting to rule them, and more to do with not wanting to be ruled by them. It has more to do with being a globally focussed mercantile nation, than a narrowly continental focussed one.

Europeans never understand this, so they never understand the British.

true,Lastaria,cnty-england,England - Liverpool,"I have to take you to task over this. despite living in the UK 10 years, you appear to have only experienced a narrow band of people from the UK and their attitudes to Europe.

Many here feel closer to Europe than America. Despite sharing a common language with America, their political views can be quite different. UK is more left of centre than the US. The Tories, our main right of centre party are nothing compared to the Right Wing party of America, the Republicans. The UK's politics is closer to that in Western Europe than that of the states.

Culturally we have similarities. But there are also a lot of differences. Place a Brit in the same room as an American it soon becomes apparent.

You spoke of overhearing that couple. Well frankly that seems odd and not a usual reaction to me. Many Brits love going on holiday to Europe. Of course you get those ho just want to sunbathe so head to the beaches of Spain. But many also like to go and sample the culture and beauty that Europe has. Of all the people I know far more have gone to Europe than the states.

That is not to say there is not some distrust of Europe. We are after all a proud nation. And despite our now self deprecating slightly embarrassed feeling about our once empire. We still have a part of us that remembers we were the number one power on the planet and that makes it harder for us to be told what to do.

We may be a little belligerent towards Europe at times. But it is unfair to say it is entirely our fault. France and Germany, the two big powers of the EU have not exactly made us welcome. (Lets not forgot France blocked us from joining in the past). I think they feel a little threatened because we are still a powerful nation, and we may not always get on board. France and Germany do not like the idea of another country coming in with some different ideas. They easily dismiss the UK as once again posturing without recognising the fact they themselves do the same an can be quite stubborn.

I think when it comes down to it people from the UK want to be in the EU and not ruled by it. They want to work with Europe but not be overwhelmed by it and feel our own identity become smothered, We do not react well to red tape and laws imposed on us.

But despite this I think most Brits have respect for Europe and want to be an equal partner in the EU. You do get extremist usually right wingers who think differently.

&gt;What you imply - that the vast majority of people don't understand the legislation - is probably true. But it's not unique to this survey and it's probably true of the survey group too. But implying the survey is too small or the sample is unrepresentative just suggests a misunderstanding of statistics, sampling methodology and science. There's obviously a sample error - which I trust they reported.

I understand sampling data and how it's applied and extrapolated to cover a larger number of people. I personally take umbridge with how the site reported it, however. 

The linked to article contains no reference to the number of people sampled. By reporting:

&gt;According to research published by YouGov and Big Brother Watch, 71% of people say they do not trust that their online data will be kept secure and just 6% think the government has made a “clear and compelling argument” for the bill.

They're inferring that over 39.8M people distrust the Governments new piece of legislation. That's around thirteen million more people than the number who voted in the last General Election.

Now, the above paragraph does lead to an additional website, however that site also fails to state the number of people polled. There's a briefing on the Governments' bill, but neither site actually states how many people were surveyed.

Neither site also links to the actual YouGov survey. [http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/document/8psyf9z7ig/Big%20Brother%20Watch%20-%20Communications%20Bill%20Results%20121026.pdf if you're interested.]. And neither site outlines the specific questions asked, which can certainly be interpreted as being either leading and or loaded / slanted, thus introducing yet another sampling bias.

They also don't indicate that the 1858 people polled were surveyed via the internet, thus introducing a secondary bias into the results - it doesn't take into account none internet users.

I appreciate that as you ""scale up"" a sample poll, to include more of the populous you'll run into an inevitable sampling error. But I'd guarantee the margin of error would be increased significantly were this one to be scaled up.",0,1351954401,null,0,false,0,c6vscln,t3_12k97q,t1_c6vscln,t3_12k97q,null,1430309189,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Hello Lostrus. I presume that you are comparing the UK to America, where there is much more support for a small state / anarcho-capitalism / libertarianism. In the UK it is not a political movement of any sort, and very few people (and none that I know of) would be in favour of anarchism / a very small state. There would certainly be support (from some) for less government intervention eg.  less business regulation, less tax on alcohol/petrol, legalisation of drugs etc. However, the anti-state movement is almost non-existent.

This is one area in which the UK is significantly different to the US, we are far more supportive of the government, the NHS and the public sector. We are also markedly less Christian, and have hardly any hard-line evangelicals that would be found in the US. We also do not have much of a gun culture. These factors clearly significantly change the political landscape.


The only person I can think of who could be termed an anarchist is Alan Moore, creator of several comics including most notably 'V for Vendetta'. The comic's protagonist is generally considered to be an anarchist, and has a fascinating philosophical monologue talking to the statue of justice above the Old Bailey about freedom, justice, anarchism and fascism. This is certainly worth a read if you are interested in anarchism. (Note, I would recommend reading the comic, NOT watching the film. The comic is fantastic, while the film is not brilliant and is certainly far less philosophical/political.)

This was the '70's and politically we were genuinely expecting the ruskies to come over the border at any time. I saw the Berlin Wall before it fell, saw the minefields on the Eastern side and was trained to fear their firepower but never did I think of Germany as East and West, just the bit that was still invaded and the bit that we (the Allies) allowed to become independant again.

I have never since the 70's expected a physical war in Europe. With nukes things could go so badly that major wars really are relegated to the unlikely. (Don't twist this to Iraq etc, I'm talking Europe.) Germany unified was one of the best things to happen to Europe as it showed that rule by fear almost always decays eventually. The EU however is IMO a political war; they want to control all European Continent countries, without being elected. 

My view of Germany now is that it's a beautiful people but politically they still have dominance in their minds. Who dominates the EU? Angola Merkel (spelling?) from what I hear on TV, but I don't follow politics deeply. This was just my opinion on seeing the OP's question. I'm not a political scientist, just a middle aged worker bee.

I think it depends on where the person comes from in Canada. Albertans might be more similar, as they tend to be more conservative. 

As a British Columbian, I feel much closer to U.K. culture than American. I think that might be more the way Canada is laid out, though. As you go further away from Ottawa (although really I should say Toronto), the effect you have on the direction the country takes gets less. Whether that is real or imagined is another thing entirely, but it contributes to the fierce drive to forge our own identity as we don't feel we drive the national one.

Case in point: the crude oil pipeline that is being proposed to bridge from Alberta to the B.C. coast. There has been large protests against it. While there are valid environmental concerns with the project, I feel the majority of the out cry is based in how Ottawa is aiding the project. It appears to the public that Ottawa is steam rolling B.C. interests in favor of national interest and Albertan profits.

As an aside, the Canadian government has entered an agreement with the U.K. to share embassies and consulates in certain areas. I think that speaks for itself.

But living in Belgium I find I relate quite well to the various Europeans I meet. We have similar goals and aspirations, and a similar attitude to how society works.

It's things like at least 4 weeks holiday. The way we feel that government is there to do a job, and not some remote concept to be feared or to be obeyed. That businesses operate as a service rather than as a means to become rich. The main difference here is the view of Americans that they're all temporarily embarrassed millionaires.

true,IIAOPSW,uk,"""the states""... don't look at me like that","I wouldn't really call the Republican party pro-British. Mitt Romney described it as ""a small island that doesn't produce anything anyone wants to buy.""

Furthermore, it is hard to count supplying Napoleon and invading Canada as ""undermining"" Britain as during the early 19th century US relations with Britain were far from ""special"".

Let's ignore the historically accurate truth that the war of independence was fought for what the colonist considered ""rights every British person should have"". Why ignore this? Because that isn't how its taught in American schools and thus very few American's think of their rights as ""the proper entitlements of a British person"". For that reason, Britain sometimes takes the roll of a cartoon villain in American politics. A sort of ""anti-freedom"" forces that was defeated. It is sort of like how in post revolutionary countries there is a constant ""enemy"" (either real or imagined) used to unite the people. Of course, using Britain as this enemy is silly in a practical sense. Today the ""enemy"" is China and terrorists. 20 years ago it was the soviets.

It is really hard to pin down the exact cultural differences, because there are cultural differences within America itself. Regrettably America gets a reputation abroad of being bible thumpin', gun totin' knob heads. Here are the most general differences:

1. American's are not subtle. Humour does not translate very well.
2. American nationalism is fundamentally different from European nationalism. The statement ""I am British"" means I have a British heritage and share in the history of Britain. The statement ""I am American"" means I believe in the principals on which America was founded and the things that it represents.
3. The views on the roll of government is fundamentally different. Europe tends to have things like ""welfare state"" and ""nanny state"" and other things that American's would be suspicious of. American's just don't like the concept of government. It has to do with the concept of the ""land of opportunity"" and the ""post revolutionary sentiment"" I mentioned before. Things like entitlement programmes are sometimes seen as ""the government taking from the winners and giving to the losers"" which contradicts the notion that if you work hard enough you can make a name for yourself. Regulations are seen as the government ""taking our economic freedoms"" (even though no such freedoms exist in the constitution). They tend to believe that free enterprise can perform all tasks better than government even when such is demonstrably false.
4. American's put ideology above practicality. I'll admit it, the right to bear arms makes no sense in the 21st century. However, it is a constitutional right and therefore is protected no matter what. This goes back to #2. If you take away the principals (the things in the constitution) then the statement ""I am American"" ceases to make sense.

Anyone who’s watched Suarez for us or Uruguay can see what it takes to get the best out of him: play him with players with great movement, good footballing brains who are adept at quick one touch pass and move football. But despite our years of scouting we decided to partner him with a player who had none of those attributes.

The main issue I have here is the accusation that Carroll does not have a good footballing brain, next being that Carroll has bad movement. If you say that Carroll has a bad footballing brain, then you have no idea what you are on about, nor do you understand what a footballing brain is. There are many types, each different to the style that the person plays. 

Andy Carroll is a player who thrives off his movement. His footballing brain was to begin with that of a Newcastle team, long balls the head onto. Liverpool don't want to play that way, well we shouldn't have. Go back to last season and just look at the amount of balls Carroll was given in the air, most pointless and stupid. The team looked at Carroll as a man who can head a ball, not a man who can play good, simple football. 

Sure, he is slow at times on the ball, and no he is not great with the first time balls, but I can recall a few times that he was good. He can take the ball at his feet, hold off the defender, slow the ball down, then give the simple ball, as that is the essence of the game, simple football. 

I can recall quite a few times where Carroll would slip in Suarez, less vice-versa but it was sure there. Now would be a good time to introduce this, a google doc I created last season following the stats of Suarez and Carroll. 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjLUZ3M_zZdCdHJhN00wZldscE42X3h4VDRXS2xKV0E#gid=0

This is, as stated, showing the partnership of Suarez and Carroll over the 2011/12 season. It is not as detailed as I would hope for this conversation but I shall make do. 

It is all well labelled and as far as I know, it is all correct (people can change the data because I want to let them use the filters. Do not change the data though, I can copy and paste it back in after anyway for I have a copy). What i want to focus on for the moment is the table in the bottom right, the ""Andy Carroll/ Luiz Suarez"" one, with played games and what not. 

Look at this stat. Out of the 51 games in the season, Andy Carroll started a total of 29, 9 of which Suarez had no part in and 16 where the both started on the park. Of these 16 games, Liverpool won, gaining 30 points total and had a percentage win rate of 62.5%. Note, Liverpool got more points when both Carroll and Suarez started than in any other combination. 

Carroll was also subbed into 18 games, 15 of which were when Suarez started. Of these 15 games, we got a total of 4 wins and 16 points, a winning percentage of 35.56%. 

A partnership will never form if one of the strikers is always being mixed around, there is never any sort of consistency. I experienced it just this season. There is a completely different connection between people who play together all the time and those who play periodically together. This is something that cannot be denied. 

Sure you could look at the fact that there were 4 games Carroll never played in while Suarez started them and we won 4, winning percentage 83.33%, but we can reverse it and look at the 9 games Carroll started in and Suarez never played in, winning 6 and getting a percentage of 66.67%, the second highest out of all of them. (Do explore the rest of the data, use the filters in row 1 and don't change the data, there is no need to).

&gt;More than that, his partnership with Suarez has looked, again, to be restricting the side. I know the arguments and stats out there: the ones that say that the mere sight of the man’s pony tail makes Suarez’s shots hit the post and go in instead of hit the post and go out. But the real stat that matters is that in all competitions, Raul Meireles created as many goals for Suarez last season as Andy Carroll. And Raul played 15 minutes with Luis all year.

In response to this I say two things. 1st, did Meireles not leave us? So what can us getting rid of him have to do with anything? Second, I would like you to find somewhere in those stats of yours and look for not how many assists Carroll got, but how many goals he played a major contributing factor to. I will go to me for I have no better example at the present moment. 

This season, I player striker for the first time. In 24 games I scored 28 goals and got 18 assists. However, I played a role in all but about 10 of our teams 75 odd goals this season. I can remember (and have footage) of quite a few goals of which I laid a ball off or down the line to the guy who then passed to the goal scorer. It is more than just assists.

&gt;Suarez wants to pass and move, Carroll wants crosses and headers.

This is not true. Suarez is true, but you, like so many others, are stereotyping Carroll. I can remember countless times last season where Carroll would do something as simple as run off his defender to receive a ball going backwards, and the ball, simple enough as it is to do, is played in the air to his chest. He then has to control it down and hold off the defender. The biggest flaw with Carroll last season had nothing to do with Carroll, but with the team and always thinking, ""Carroll is big, he will want it to his head."" That is a point I see no way for you to dispute. 

&gt;I’m sick to death of the excuses people make for his poor form and attitude. I really am. First it was he’s injured. Then it became he’s not fully fit. Then it was we didn’t have the players to get the best out of him. Then it was Kenny not playing him enough. Then it was because Luis was so good it made him look bad. Then it was because he wasn’t fully fit. Then it was because Gerrard was out. Then it was confidence and he just needs a goal. Then it was moving to another city. Then, it was his age. Then, it was the fans fault.

Ok, if you get injured, you always need time to recover. You then need to get fit again. That is just common knowledge. They are not the main reasons for Carroll's bad form. There are three main points, the rest are pointless. 

1. Then it was we didn’t have the players to get the best out of him.
2. Then it was Kenny not playing him enough. 
3. Then it was confidence and he just needs a goal.

Once again I state that the team always used Carroll as a big man up front, and that was it. Rarely did he get the ball to his feet, but when he did he did well (not all the time, but most). Again I must stress the importance of constancy. **The most matches that Carroll started last season in a row was 3 matches.**  You cannot hope to find form and create a partnership like that. Kenny faltered here. 

Just so you know, with Kenny playing Carroll in the manner that he was, in and out of games, any players confidence goes down. It can happen for a single game and it can happen over time, but if some ones confidence is low, it is a lot harder for them to play, this is not up for dispute for you cannot.

&gt; By putting in absolute average, lazy performances for 90% of the season.

I missed this. This is a crap statement. Plain and simple. Carroll worked his ass off most games, he is slowish and quite lanky so it looks like he is not doing much, but he does the subtleties, the small runs, the push onto the defender to then come back to receive, to open up space. Lazy is Gerrard, but that is a whole other argument in general. 

I would Like to make 1 final statement. You go on, like me, for quite a while talking about how bad Carroll is, how he didn't suit ""the plan"" and how he doesn't fit with Suarez's style. Well, why the hell, does Carroll have to do all the work? Why can Suarez not adjust his game also, so that they both fix each others problems.

In fact, the finale was made with less money than some of the previous episodes, because it was in the second-to-last production block.

Murray Gold has also composed the music for the whole new series so far.

true,BritishImgurian,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"Sadly, being a 3 o'clock kickoff, I had to stream today. Because of that I was watching mostly individual pixels running around rather than players, so here's the best I could write from what I could see:

**MOTM - Hazard** We didn't have all of our starting 11 available but it didn't even Mata. Hazard stepped up a level and took Mata's place, running into gaps, creating space and chances and just generally bring the Bee's Knees. At the start of this season he was on target for 3 assists a game, but he dropped off a little, seemingly as Mata returned well-rested from his International shizzle. I think Hazard really steps up when the rest of the team stands down, and he clearly offers a lot of danger to the opposition because he was getting fouled pretty damn often.

**Mikel/Romeu is too defensive.** They both play the same role as the defensive DM, which disjoints our defence and attack - The connection just isn't there in the centre, and instead we're forced onto the wings. With one CF on pitch (in poor form at that)  we shouldn't be forcing ourselves on the wings. Di Matteo did the right thing bringing Ramires on to try get some goals in.

**Our defence isn't good enough.** I believe we did so well defensively at the start of the season because the defence simply wasn't being challenged. As soon as we started playing good teams we started to see the goals in our own net - City, Athletico, Juventus, Donetsk, United, and now the fast paced Swansea. I don't know what it is exactly (or else I'd be a paid defensive coach) but the gaps are clear - especially on the score line.

**Luiz doesn't help it either.** I commented on Luiz's mistakes last Post-Match thread, and even though he didn't play today, I'm going to comment on them again. Luiz is a beautiful man and a skilled footballer but he weakens our defensive line far too often. I would love to see him tested as DM who could drop back when needed but offer an offensive option. I just think that when the pressure builds upon him, he isn't reliable enough to keep our defence strong and the goals start pouring in. 

**Torres ಠ_ಠ** The guy seriously needs to shape up soon. Our creativity is there but our finishing is not. Being the only CF on the pitch most of the time, 
it's his job to finish the damn chances. The January transfer window is fast approaching and there are a lot of rumours flying around about our attack. The simple fact is that there wouldn't be rumours if Torres was doing his job. He needs to shape up, not just for Chelsea, but for himself too. He couldn't even put the ball in the net after the whistle had gone and the keeper had started to walked off...

**Moses is on fire like a burning bush.** I love this guy. I almost wish we didn't have so many awesome midfielders because he deserves so much more playing time. In the last two games he has offered so much pace and creativity that he has controlled the right wing and split defences like the Red Sea. I think he will start earning himself a lot more starts in the future.

**The fatigue is kicking in** We just didn't have the energy, especially in the first half. It was so painful to watch how slow we were moving around, and Donetsk on Wednesday is just going to add to the pain. We have a lot of games this year, so we need to be smarter about who plays when.

The issues are complicated. The CA are a simplistic public relations exercise.

I don't understand how you think Defoe is better for the team than Adebayor. Adebayor's whole thing is that he brings the other members of the team into the game.

Adebayor is more smooth. And with Adebayor on the field, we bring Gylfi into the game - meaning we have two goal scoring threats in the center of the box. That's good, very good, and just what we need. 

Like I said, I don't understand why you think Gylfi is not fit for the center of the pitch? That's where he plays. That's his position. Putting crosses in isn't what he does, score goals or play very good through balls are the things he does well.

The other issue is the withdrawal, some addicts purposely choose to take their own life, and use herion to do so because they know they cannot face withdrawal. 

I often see people comparing alcohol related deaths in the context of illegal drugs or drug legalisation. For me it is a moot point, if it was discovered now in the modern day then yes it would most likely be made illegal. However it wasn't, so it isn't, and cannot really be used to justify why we should legalise certain drugs. ( note legalise not decriminalise). Just because one thing can be bad for you doesn't mean we should then make legal something else that can be bad. Also the health risks of alcohol are different to that of other drugs, moderate amounts of alcohol will not adversely affect your health, even on along term basis. Moderate amounts of heroin will do, and will create a physical and psychological addiction much quicker than alcohol will. 

As for opiates, morphine and the derivatives are still widely used, as they should be. Right now I am damned happy with the co-codamol prescribed for my back ache!

What I'm saying is that people DO have these feelings in life. I think it's important to understand that and to be forgiving. If your sister or someone you loved in your life had doubts about their upcoming marriage, would you tell them they were terrible people? What sort of punishment would you want inflicted upon them?

I also think it's important to note that Rory wasn't her husband at that point. If the sanctity of marriage is your concern, Amy hadn't made any vows at the point that she cheated on him. I know that doesn't make it okay but if you're worried about how the show depicts marriage, she never did cheat on him after they wed. I'm weary of this depiction of Amy as this big cheater - she kissed the doctor once, probably because she was scared to get married. I don't think her feelings for the doctor were ever particularly serious. 

And I mean, I think you CAN claim ""I didn't ask you to be this way"" even when you're married. It's the basic rule of human interaction.

In the absence of government, there is no single entity to take over and an invasion would have to go door-to-door to gain resources. Small groups of people with weapons or a private police force could handle such an unlikely thing.

I say, cut our ties with Torres (after all he's a Atletico production), bring on a seasoned veteran that's in form, and keep Lukaku ready in the wings. Torres is only a shell of who he once was and we can't gamble any further on him returning to form. We need a finisher and as of right now, we don't have a reliable one.

He no longer does this and instead looks for an easy pass, which is usually just horizontally to the nearest defender. It's boring to watch when we know he is (or at least was) capable of so much more forward flair.

Early on in the second half a player simply surged at him (which no Spurs player seemed to want to do with the ball) which laughably knocked him off balance. Was he really that unprepared for an opposing player to *gasp* TAKE THE BALL FORWARD? I know it seemed unthinkable for Spurs to take a player on that game but the fact that Wigan had the sheer nerve to try it left poor old lazy Tom in such a shocked state that he almost fell to the fucking floor.

Later on towards the end of the game dear old Tom found himself with a large amount of space in Wigans half of the pitch, if anyone recalls. He had a good 5-10 seconds with NO PRESSURE at all on the ball, tried to do a chip pass out to the wing which ended up planted straight on the noggin of a Wigan player. The ball found it's way back to dear old Tom. He then dithered with it and was closed down when he had a fucking aeon to decide what to do with it. I cannot for the life of me comprehend why people have been singing his praises recently when his play is nothing but lethargic.

Assuming PC sales remain stable they should still be around - if people opt to go for mobile solutions then I can see them really being hit hard.

**Waterstone's?** Some think James Daunt signed their death warrant the second he agreed to allow Amazon to sell Kindles in their branches - personally I think given they fucked up the deal to get the Nook range from Barnes &amp; Noble [which is now on sale through other retailer partners] and knowing full well Amazon spend more on R&amp;D within their Kindle sub-company than the entire Waterstone's budget? Dude wasn't faced with much of a choice.

I still think he's the wrong person for the job - I get the impression he's trying to turn Waterstone's into a nationalised version of Daunt Books, so it wouldn't shock me if they're gone within twenty years. Actually it wouldn't shock me if they're gone within ten.

How **WH Smith** is still in business boggles my mind - I fully expect them to have gone within the next twenty years, especially as consumers move away from physical books / magazines.

Stores like **Cash Converters, CeX, Cash Generator** and other ""Sell your stuff; Get a pittance"" stores will likely prosper, than start to struggle due to market saturation - if there's five such stores on one high street, that just leads to decreased revenue for all of them. 

Especially as the market for physical media is falling apart [I paid £6.50 this morning for two blu-rays out of CeX. That's less than I used to pay for secondhand DVDs out of Cash Converters.]

The various RIPA style laws that apply at the moment oblige ISPs to retain browsing history for a period (I think it's six months) and also emails (that go through the ISPs servers).  This new law obliges ISPs to engage in more monitoring - e.g. chatting on social media, etc.

But this is where things get complicated.  Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc., all use HTTPS by default these days, the ISPs won't know what's being said, so they won't be able to track anything.  Those aforementioned companies are almost certainly only too willing to spill the beans to law enforcement if requested, but that's not what this law requires, and other companies will be less co-operative anyway.  The law obliges ISPs to do all of this.

But it's impossible, unless:

* they're going to ban HTTPS.  (Unlikely, as it will make everyone vulnerable to cyber criminals.)
* they're going to Man-In-The-Middle HTTPS connections.  (I wouldn't put it past them to try... but again makes people vulnerable to cyber criminals if the man-in-the-middling is done badly.)
* some third-party consultancy has sold them some snake oil that claims to break all encryption.
* they just haven't thought it through.

Ultimately our need for results overpowered the potential benefits of riding it out. Fact is we needed points and dropping Carroll was the only way to make it work.

Heroin and alcohol are a bad - but common - combination.  They both depress respiration and the CNS.

&gt;some addicts purposely choose to take their own life, and use herion to do so because they know they cannot face withdrawal.

Suicides are undoubtedly high amongst dependent opiate users.  Of course, some people fuck up and it gets listed as suicide, but without doubt there are intentional suicides a plenty.  How many are due to fear of withdrawal though, I couldn't say.  How many are due to memories of abuse?  There's a good reason one of the major drugs of abuse is a major pain killer, and at least two of them (alcohol/heroin) are drugs which help people to forget or ignore shit from ones previous or current life.

&gt;However it wasn't, so it isn't, and cannot really be used to justify why we should legalise certain drugs

What you say is true, but how much more damage would alcohol do if it was illegal?  I support the legalisation of heroin for public health and public safety reasons mostly.  Yes for reasons of civil liberties too, but those arguments are secondary.

&gt;moderate amounts of alcohol will not adversely affect your health, even on along term basis. Moderate amounts of heroin will do,

I'm kind of on the fence as to whether or not I want to spend the money for it though. I think right now, it's between Mason, Selly Oak, and Spinney depending on how my price range works out. My question is, for these three, would I be trying to find people to live with on my own, or would the University just slot me into a flat depending on my preferences and their availabilities? And say if I'm in a 6-room Selly Oak flat with only 4 people, would my flat mates and I have to pay enough for 6 people?

As for the website, it is beautifully designed and definitely offers a great deal of details for the different choices. The thing is, because there are so many flats/halls/apartments, it gets very overwhelming. I really just wouldn't have known where to start if you hadn't pointed me towards the accommodations above. I also found it rather difficult to keep track of which ones I'd looked at, and what I liked about each one. If there was a page where the accommodations were listed in a chart and compared to each other based on the most requested features, (ie, ensuite, shared bathroom, price rage) then it would be a lot easier to get a general idea of where to get started. Or perhaps there can be a bit of a quiz based on what a student requested, and then the website can offer up a list of accommodations that best match their preferences?

In terms of localised government versus nationalised judgement, this is actually a key problem with democracy. People don't vote because they feel their say has no meaning.

Of course the size of the group voting on their own internal system is entirely the line between anarchy and some sort of global democracy. Draw the line too close to the individual and you have anarchical type behaviour. Draw the line too far away and you have apathy and disconnection which breeds elitism, contempt and such forth.

The response is that different powers should be democratised at different levels. The phrase 'An Englishman's home is his castle' is somewhat appropriate of course. 

As a country I think we get it reasonably correct. Europe is obviously an issue. The problem primarily is one of economics however and not laws.

In the second article, it mentions using conductive foam to make your stylus, so I guess you could just replace the UV nub with that instead. Ipads have a capacative touch screen, which is why you need a special type of stylus, whereas resistive touch screens are older and just detect the pressure of something touching the screen, which was why so many old touch screen phones ended up pocket-dialing people.

EDIT: On closer inspection of the second article I found this:
&gt;First you need to understand that you need to be able to conduct a small electric current from your body to the capacitive touch screen on the iPad, an important consideration when choosing what kind of instrument you modify.

This means that just sticking some conductive foam in the nib might not be enough, since I am assuming the surrounding material of the sonic is not very conductive.

true,myimportantthoughts,cnty-uk,It's grim up North London,"While we might watch their TV shows, American politics is not quite the same as UK politics.

We strongly support a mixed economy, with a large public and private sector. The debate over Obamacare is symptomatic of this, many Americans, including many poor Americans do not support Obamacare and do not want much government provision intervention in the healthcare market. So why is this? Americans appear (to me) to be more individualistic than Brits, it is mostly 'every man for himself'. Obviously this would mean people paying for their own healthcare. On the same note, Americans have a dislike (I would say phobia) of anything that is 'socialist' or 'communist'. They seem to hate this. Possibly it is related to a Cold War era hatred that has not stopped, but 'socialism' is perhaps the most toxic word in America. This even extends to many poor Americans who cannot afford healthcare and would benefit from intervention in the healthcare industry. This demonstrates how strong their beliefs are. Branding Obamacare 'Socialist' certainly invoked hatred within many Americans. In the UK however, the NHS is lauded as almost a national treasure, it was celebrated in the Olympic (or was it paralympic?) opening ceremony. While we may complain about waiting lists and MRSA, hardly anyone in the UK would wish to remove the 'free at the point of use' system. It is ingrained in national culture.

I am interested that you find our concept of 'liberty' depressing. Politics/philosophy is not my specialist subject, but I will explore this briefly. I would guess that the key issue here is how we define 'liberty'. **Who are we being liberated from?** Are we being freed from capitalism, governance, or other people?

Marxists would say that true liberation would mean the destruction of capitalism, stating that capitalism is the true oppressor of liberty. They would say that true liberty would mean equal distribution of resources and state control of production. This would certainly be more equal, but would people be more free? It depends.

American libertarians / anarcho capitalists (perhaps clutching their copy of 'Atlas Shrugged') believe that liberty is freedom from the government. This is what I gather that you would associate yourself with. This 'freedom' leads to worship of the right to bear arms, as a defence against the government. They also see unregulated capitalism and the free market as vital to freedom. And destroying the state does indeed lead to great freedom, we could smoke crack in the street, not pay tax, and shout things at David Cameron without being arrested. However, there is a caveat to this great 'freedom' that is often missed. The problem (as almost any economist will tell you) is that the free market does not always create the best outcome for consumers (please hear me out). The issue is that without regulation, there is nothing to stop companies from ripping off consumers, stealing ideas, polluting and engaging in anti-competitive behaviour. Why should they, when profit is the only motive. And I know what the libertarians would say '*other people will enter the market, and competition will work for consumers*'. But this is not always the case. Giants like Amazon or Microsoft are excellent at crushing competition, killing off or buying out other firms to remove competition. They have so much money and power that they can afford to give away free products until their competitor goes bankrupt, then jacking up the price once more. This has happened in the past and will happen again. You can easily look up the anti-competitive practices of Apple and Microsoft, who are both brutal with competition.

So anarcho-libertarianism frees us from the government, but it would allow companies to develop such power that they would be become small states. This is no joke, the net worth and power of many multinationals like Shell, Apple etc would dwarf that of some small states. Think for example, of Black Wednesday when George Soros broke the Bank of England by short selling Sterling to the tune of ten billion pounds (he wanted to do more but ran out of people willing to trade with him). This is the power of just 1 man in a tiny office of traders. Companies can be exceptionally powerful even with great government intervention, and would 'blossom' without government. Finally, a lack of government would mean no social security. A baby born into a poor family in Britain today can at least expect an education at the taxpayers expense. But without the government, who would pay for education? The baby would have hardly any chance of learning how to read and write, and no healthcare of any kind. This would obviously limit this person's ability to do lots of things, read Harry Potter, get a job, ice skate etc etc. While there is no one explicitly preventing the child from doing these things, they are clearly unable to do them. This is the difference between negative freedom ( no one is stopping me) and positive freedom (I am unable to do x without help). Also, in this libertarian society, who would protect us from eg. the stereotypical serial killer? We all have the freedom to go as we please, with any manner of dangerous weapons. But if we give Murderous Maggie freedom she might use this freedom to decapitate Innocent Igor, which would obviously decrease Igor's freedom. A state also means that we have protection from each other (as individuals), through the police and the justice system. While you might denounce the state, I am sure that you would be happy to call for help from the police in certain circumstances. 


It all comes down to who we wish to have freedom from. In Britain, we accept that the state limits our freedom partially, but we prefer this to anarchism because we think that we would have even less freedom without the government. You believe that you would have more freedom without the government. We can actually both be right, depending on what sort of freedom (positive/negative) and who we fear will limit it.

TLDR: Liberty / freedom is far more complex and subtle than most people could imagine.

I can't see this working at all, but that doesn't mean it won't happen, of course.  But this could be disastrous for UK online business.

In order to MITM everything, they're going to need a certificate authority to sign the certificates.  Would any certificate authority do this?  It would be an instant reputation killer, their business would evaporate overnight.  Presumably UK-based certificate authorities won't have a choice.

But that will just end up with UK-based certificate authorities being delisted from browsers elsewhere in the world.  The inevitable consequence being any UK-based online business being unable to verify their own identity to the outside world.

And of course, it'll be impossible to keep any of this secret, it will be common-knowledge within one day which certificate authority needs to be removed to prevent being Man-in-the-Middled.

Sure I get to go to college a year early, but it's only the local community college and I'm only doing it because my school offers practically nothing to seniors (I live in NY, and as of my junior year I'd already taken all but one of the Regents my school offered). Plus, I have to pay full tuition because I'm not eligible for financial aid because I technically need like 3 credits to complete high school. 

TL;DR College early is not as awesome as it sounds. But it still is pretty awesome.

Then I realized you were probably referring to the fact that nobody mentioned my youthful appearance to me. It is nice, but it probably has to do with the fact that half the people at community college are either older than 40 or braindead. Or they're poor and it was the only American education they could afford, so all they want to do is pass their classes and get the fuck out.

true,Wildcard35,num22-away,,"Start Lloris. I think that right now this is something we can all agree on. What was the point of breaking Friedel's consecutive starting streak if we weren't trying to start Lloris more and get him acclimated to the English game? Also, Friedel has yet to record a clean sheet in all the games he's played. When Lloris got the call up for our game against Aston Villa he pulled the clean sheet. I realize we had Dembele and a fairly intact squad, but his playing has spoken for itself. Friedel has done nothing to merit a benching, but Lloris has proven that he can more than fill the American's shoes.
As far as the defense goes...some work needs to be done. I realize Walker has plummeted out of form, but he just needs a swift kick in the ass to get him out of it. Honestly, if AVB wanted to send a message and bench him for a game he should start Michael Dawson (The White Wall!), who grew under the tutelage of Ledley King and who should be seeing more playing time. Bench Walker, put in Carroll, and then see if Walker gets the message. I've got mixed feelings about Gallas, he plays well every other game, but I feel that he's getting to be a bit too old to be anchoring our defense, especially now that we are losing our defensive mids to injury (Sandro...why?!)
There is a lot that can be said about the current squad right now. We're in a very difficult situation given our injuries and the lack of cohesion that has resulted in a regime change under AVB. The best we can do is keep supporting our Spurs (unlike half the fuck-socks in the stands today) and hope that we start seeing our injured players return healthy and ready to turn things around.

But,  the US &amp; Canada are even worse.  They have this eery feeling of being familiar, but wrong in subtle ways.  The cars are bigger, the bacon is streaky shit, everything costs less, $1 bills instead of coins,  everything and everyone is so exuberant, the sports they follow are so different, NFL, MLB, NBA - the fact that college football games get flyovers from the National Guard Air Force sums up a lot of it.

Plus in the US everything is so much like the kind of society you create in pc games, where you have to set up agencies and industries from the top down, put everything in its place.  Things like having a Federal Bureau of Investigation/Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, Secret Service etc  vs having 'the police' which is simply divided up into localities, with the London Metropolitan branch doing a lot of the 'national duties' just because thats where a lot of the stuff happens.  

Every state being a microcosm of the US government with its own constitution, legislature, governor and supreme court - its all so well defined - that is very alien to my British upbringing where our legal and civic system simply evolved over 1000 years.  If you are there during election season, which is approximately 1 year before a Presidential election and 6 months before a midterm election, politics is everywhere.  In Britain we do things on a much smaller scale.


However I do feel quite at home in Australia, as do a hell of a lot of Brits.  I spent some time working in a hospital in Perth, and was worried initially that it would be a weird culture problem - but 1/3 of the doctors there were also British.  The food is sort of similar, except 100 better, especially the bacon.  

The bacon is a very important part of this whole post, I should really have spent more time on it but there we go.

No surprises there then. Prefer the company of those ethnically closest to me.

The septics are a different ball game though. They have all of the above in various measures - and I feel the same way about Italian Americans as I do Italian Italians - plus some other weird post colonial mutations, and a steaming slavery hangover.

In this moment (three beers in), I feel that while I watch the economic chaos in Europe vs the economic shenanigans in the states, that as I hear how bad Europe is, i feel we'll pull through anyway, despite our differences. Whereas I find I'm just waiting for the states to sink into insignificance, a historical footnote of what could have been.

I've never articulated that thought - and I suspect its validity given my boozed up state and aversion to all things history, so take it with a pinch of salt (as with 'interesting girl's' random take), but I'd have to say, with no factual support, or review of my current logic, I'm a (mostly pro germanic) europhile.

No, it doesn't. It is far worse. The draft bill (assuming this is the [Communications Data Bill](http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm83/8359/8359.pdf) - warning, large pdf full of legalese) would give the Government the power to order pretty much anyone (not just ISPs) to do *anything necessary to give various authorities (police, security services, HMRC etc.) access to any communications data*. Without a warrant, and with very minimal Parliamentary oversight.

And this doesn't just apply to the Internet, it explicitly applies to the post and, by my reading, almost every possible form of communications (including hand-signals).

As for HTTPS, the most likely option is the man-in-the-middle one. This could be done through the ""black boxes"" they are planning to put in every ISP hub, which will also log all communications. The other option is that they haven't thought it through, and are just doing what the law enforcement lobby (i.e. the black-box manufacturing lobby) tell them to.",0,1351983117,null,0,false,0,c6vyqbb,t3_12k97q,t1_c6vyqbb,t1_c6vw12b,null,1430312257,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"&gt;4) I don't see what Adebayor has that Defoe doesn't do better. Ade is tall, but doesn't win headers. He sometimes holds up the ball, but his first touch is so bad it generally doesn't matter, whereas Jermaine is great at keeping the ball right at his feet and just stiff arming anyone on his back. Ade's shot obviously isn't as good as Jermaine's, and his tendency to constantly drift out wide is useless as a lone striker. We have a hard enough time getting bodies in the box without our striker trying to play winger as well.


I'm with you on a lot of the stuff but this whole point I take exception to. First and foremost Ade is not really an impact sub type of player. I think he does a lot better when he starts games. Conveniently JD is among the best substitute goalscorers in the country. 

Ade's first touch is inconsistent, true. When it's on it's insane when it's not it's woeful. Don't really care about JD's stiff arm; he still does absolutely fuck all with the ball 90% of the time.

Where I really disagree with you though is your point about lone strikers drifting wide being useless. If we aren't spamming balls into the box it's actually more pointless for a striker to be static in that area. Look at the game against Maribor for a pretty good dichotomy of lone striker play. First half JD sits in the box and is completely static. This means our players have little space as our opponents aren't really having to move. Second half he started working the channels a lot and dropping deeper and we looked more threatening.

Moving around can drag defenders and create space for teammates and add momentum to attacks. Watch how RVP played particularly at Arsenal. Constantly moving into channels, dropping deep, finding space and creating for his teammates. THAT'S how a lone striker should play. Being static in the box works for hoofball but not for teams who want to keep it on the ground.

The EU and the Euro is Germany's baby. Since the burden of reunification the Euro has helped German companies become competitive within a market which previously they were priced out of due to the strength of the DM. Their entire strength is a direct consequence of the struggle and misery many of the periphery nations now find themselves in. Don't get me wrong, I'm not an apologist for anyone. I firmly believe in making ones bed and sleeping in it. The clues were very clearly written on the wall for everyone to see clearly.

When George Soros ruined sterling all those years ago, he was able to make his fortune and name because of the weakness of the Pound in the ERM... a pre cursor to the Euro where European currencies were pegged to the DM. 

Anyway, before I digress my point is, Germany has had a decade of good times off the back of the back of the Euro and their unwitting neighbours. Now, they find themselves having to bankroll the nations which they partially helped bankrupt. 

If bailed out, Spain will require more than Ireland, Greece and Portugal combined. Italy is simply terrifying. How they haven't strung up Berlusconi is beyond me. We, and I especially, complain about Gordon Brown's spending but Silvio takes the biscuit. At least Gordo had the sense to issue long dated debt. Silvo went one step further. He racked up close to EUR2 Trillion in debt which needs to be serviced within the next three years. Italy is a BIG FUCKING PROBLEM which nobody wants to openly talk about yet because panic would send yields soaring, and who is underwriting all of these bailouts one way or another.... Germany....

I've not even mentioned about Greece coming back into focus...

I've had many packages lost, and it took a lot of complaining and threatening to get any compensation.

For instance, the most recent one was a 6 month season ticket for regular train travels to and from work. Cost around £200. Sent by *Special Delivery*. I chose to get it delivered to work to ensure I'd get it, since I couldn't guarantee I'd be at home. 

A week past, I had nothing. FirstGreatWestern had proof that Royal Mail had sent it, and told me to take the matter up with them.

Royal Mail weren't much help. Even with a full tracking number, they couldn't locate my package. Lost. They couldn't tell me where it was or when I'd get some sort of compensation. They said to start the compensation process and we can go from there.

So I did.

2 weeks past since I sent the form off, nothing.

So I ring up again.

Their excuse? ""We never received it"".

I sent it again, now using their own *Recorded Delivery* service.

I finally had proof someone at Royal Mail's office had signed for it.

Another week past, still nothing.

I ring up again. Excuse this time? ""We have been unable to get into contact with your local sorting office to verify with them, that the parcel is lost.""

Another few days, I ring them up again. ""We've spoken to your local sorting office, they have no trace of your parcel at all so it never arrived there, therefore we need to do more investigation"".

Another week later, I finally get a letter. Compensation? Ha! It was a rail voucher for £15. 

I rang up again, totally fumming and said not only is that much much less than the value of what was sent to me, it was a flipping rail voucher.

They told me that I would need to formally complain if I wasn't happy as in their eyes they have compensated me for the cost of the travel I'd have to take without the ticket. Huh? How on earth does that much sense?

After a further 3 weeks of complaining, I finally got a full £200 compensation but only after taking it all the way to the Postal Review Panel.

FirstGreatWestern were actually pretty cool though, they rang me a few times during this mess to ask if there was anything they could do, and one of their supervisors also offered me a full refund and said ""leave the lost ticket to us, we'll just refund you.""

This is not the only time it happened. I had an iPad delivered from Amazon as a gift, sent also by Recorded Delivery. Practically the same as above happened.

With that said, my local post office is pretty good (not my local sorting office though), they all pretty friendly, know me well, leave parcels with neighbours or in safe places, also pretty cool with it if I ask them to leave the parcel or package at the post office free of charge (none of that £1.50 extra charge shite).

&gt;The society you want to create cannot ever exist, it can only exist when scarcity doesn't exist. And if scarcity doesn't exist there's no need for ~~anarcho~~ **capitalism**. 

Hope this is clearer.



&gt;How? I don't understand how you arrive at this conclusion? Feudalism is extremely ant free market and authoritarian. Do you understand what anarchy means? I'm not sure you do because your statement that anarcho-capitalism devolves into feudalism is quite simply logically invalid.

true,Leynal030,null,null,"You're simply not understanding what I'm saying here. Totally understandable as the concept is completely alien to most people. Yes, the 'laws' are optional, in some senses. Each individual set of laws are certainly optional as you are not forced to adhere to any particular system. It is of course in your best interest to have laws protecting yourself, but you have a choice in how that is provided rather than having a certain court system imposed on you from birth. There are also going to be different laws in effect between different people. Keep in mind this is true in any statist system as well. A French and an Englishman have two different sets of laws governing them which apply differently depending on the particulars of the case. We're simply proposing to do away with the geographical monopoly part. 

As for being an improvement we simply have to look at the incentives involved to see that it would trend toward being more rather than less just. Each individual organization providing law can only make money (or serve people in the case of non-profits) if they can convince people to use their service over others. If they provide 'bad' laws, for instance unfair and unjust rulings that favor the rich, they will not be chosen to provide services except by a very small contingent that directly benefits. The masses of people will choose another, better service. That one will thrive and overpower the corrupt one. (Overpower in the sense of gaining market share and using social influence and pressure against them) So what we see as a trend is that there is a far greater incentive to produce 'good' law rather than bad. In a monopolist service the only thing that can happen is individual politicians getting voted out. That's assuming they're not at a term limit anyways in which case they have zero incentive to provide good law other than their own innate goodness. Obviously the system would not be perfect.

The only way Britain will continue to have a voice in the world is through the European Union.

I can log into an MMO game and send messages without being traced. There are many MMO games out there such as WoW, GW2, Eve, SW:TOR, Tera and Planetside 2. I can talk to people on these systems, in a coded manner, that to all intents and purposes seems entirely legal. I could talk in /say chat that is open to virtual people nearby but is not necessarily recorded by the company operating the game.

Similarly I can chat to a friend on Xbox Live without being traced. I could join a party or a game of Call of Duty and talk to them using my headset in a previously agreed manner that would give no idea about our intentions.

I agree with you though, it's pretty uncomfortable that they're actively trying to recruit 16 year olds (why 16 year olds can sign up is beyond me, it was 19 in the First World War (at least to be deployed overseas). I know some people who want to sign up on their 16th birthday, but can't because their parents won't let them, so instead they're going to sign up on their 18th birthday. It's really frightening that people are so eager to serve in a military that will almost certainly see no action that is defending the country.

But personally, I oppose it more for the fact that they're asking kids who can't even vote to fight and kill. I'm fairly certain that most soldiers only get fucked up in so far as their friends died in front of them and they may have survivor's guilt.

A comparison you could make is between television sets. No single company has monopoly over a square box/pane that allows you to view analogue (until recently) or digital broadcast services. We have Samsung, Sharp, Toshiba, Panasonic, LG, Sony, Philips,etc. They're all making TV sets and are competing to make a decent product. Similarly, no single company should have power over tablet computers.

Apple patented their iPad but thankfully left room for innovation from other companies. It would be a sad day if the only tablet computer on the market was an iPad. The Kindle for example is a brilliant device for keeping your book collection on. In a world with Apple domination it wouldn't exist. 

With the case of Samsung, what happened is that Samsung made a quality product that was going to threaten Apple. Yes, it has similarities but it operates on a completely different Operating System. It runs Android, Apple runs on iOS. It's like comparing Apple Mac and Windows PC's. Yes, they are both computer towers hooked up to a monitor, keyboard and mouse.

&gt; Top Gear is another subject for his chagrin, particularly Richard Hammond’s presence on the show, whom Lee compares to a school bully sycophant, giggling along to all of Clarkson’s politically incorrect jokes. “I wish Richard ‘The Hamster’ Hammond (not a real hamster), had been decapitated in that car crash and that his head had rolled on a few more yards into some boiling oil.” The Top Gear section has attracted a lot of media attention for its ‘bad taste’, notably The Daily Facist, er Mail rather, which amusingly branded Lee’s tirade an ‘extraordinary attack’.  Had some of these journalists actually attended or understood the show they might have picked up on a bit of irony here. Just like Clarkson’s defence for his un-pc humour, Lee tells us: “It’s just a joke! Although co-incidentally....that is what I wish had happened.” 

This is hypocrisy. He wants to say something whilst simultaneously saying that he's not saying it.

&gt; If Clarkson can call Gordon Brown a ‘one-eyed Scottish idiot’ in the heat of the moment then Lee can declare he hopes Jez’s kiddies go blind. Get the gist?!

The two things are not at comparable. Calling Brown a one eyed Scottish idiot is fine. Saying you hope someone's kids go blind is likely to get you decked.

So he goes back to ancient Earth history, possibly caveman era, and parks the Tardis in a remote forest and he lives with the local people.  He's the medicine man, healing those that are sick but without being overt about knowing so much more...

Essentially, the Doctor becomes responsible for providing a lot of our base technologies.  Agriculture, medicine, fire, etc...  And he loves being around such simple people, very relaxing for him.  Several hundred years later he sees one of them invent something on their own, and he realizes that even in trying to relax and live out his final days he has positively influenced humans.

true,Atomicide,num22,,"I'm going to go full retard and suggest the following, I will leave it to everyone here to rip me apart on why it is wrong (I'll even start you all off with a significant flaw).

**The problem:** Our midfield is toast, it was already lacking creatively, and with current injuries and now Sandro out it is likely to be defensively frail.

**The (Hilarious and Potential) Solution:** Fuck this shit, and go crazy. Play a diamond 4-4-2.

Stick our best defensive setup available on there.

Put Huddlestone in the Defensive midfield position. He has little creativity, but he should get a bit of space and will be able to play his long diagonals out to the wing (Bale, Lennon). He generally goes back or sideways anyway, and this will play to that.

Lennon and Bale go on the wings as normal. However with less people in the middle they will probably be shut down easier, or be drawn towards the middle of the pitch looking for the ball. This will not play to their strengths well to be honest.

Dempsey in the attacking midfield role, with Adebayor and Defoe upfront he might be able to get into the game more. Adebayor will have good hold up play, and should be able to draw a player in to give Dempsey a bit of space. Dempsey can also hold up a bit, and between him and Adebayor they can probably fashion space to put Defoe in on goal. This would also assist with Adebayor getting into more threatening positions, and also allow Dempsey a chance to get into the game. Gylfi may also be an option in the CAM position as well.

This is in no way ideal, or a long term viable tactic. The fact of this matter is we are lacking creativity and I feel this setup may allow us to bruteforce goals through continual pressure. 

**The Drawbacks:** Defence is even more exposed, and it's not like we need that.

Our wingers will be tracked easier, and we will either be forced to play narrow or leave them isolated.

It will be near impossible to make any sort of attacking substitution and retain this formation.

Obviously, the direction the show was going changed from educational to entertaining rather quickly. However, I think Susan was a rather enjoyable companion. She offered a child's view and inquisitiveness that other companions have not necessarily demonstrated. Additionally, there was no risk of her falling for The Doctor since she was his granddaughter.

Nottingham is a great night out. Just don't go out on a Saturday, that's when the townies are about, so there's a bit more trouble.

For UoN, you've got at least one good night our per day of the working week:

* Monday: Oceana (standard club, multiple rooms with different music) or Coco Tang (smaller cocktail bar, more niche and up-market). There's also a tequila night at a place called Rescue Rooms- [it gets very messy](https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/400777_190471021087456_664974594_n.jpg)

* Tuesday: ""Fuck Hip Hop"" at Market Bar. Not been there this year, but plays mostly hip hop on a Tuesday.

* Wednesday: ""Crisis"" at Rock City. The sports teams' night out. Rock City has a main room, a smaller bar with sofas called Black Cherry Lounge, and another room. Great night out. They also do All-Nighters where they open open the adjoining clubs until 5am. Always a great night out.

* Thursday: 4Play at Forum. Great venue, great music. Fairly bog-standard club, but that's why it's great. Alternatively, there's DIVE at Market Bar, which plays a lot of alternative, underground music- stuff you won't hear in many other clubs.

* Friday: Ocean or ""Ditto"" at Forum. Ocean goes down in Nottingham folklore. It's smelly, sticky and cheesy, but it's one of the best nights out. Plus we play the baywatch theme tune, with our own twist. ""Ditto"" is like 4Play really, except it's joint with Trent, but I've never noticed many problems.

GPs in particular will have a massive backlog of referral letters to send, so everything takes ages.

Firstly, try getting your friend to give the doctor a call - telling them that he is anxious, awaiting results etc. See if they can expedite the process. A biopsy would go to the local hospital for analysis, and after 2 months it would definitely be looked at by now. So either the hospital is sitting on the result (unlikely) or the GP has in in their in-tray and hasn't looked at it yet (probable), or they've looked at it and just haven't contacted you *most likely).

true,HugoChavezRamboIII,eng-norfolk,Naaaarch,"I'm not saying there are no clever people who are dissatisfied with our relationship with Europe, I'm saying that most people who aren't clever don't like Europe. 

I believe this is because of a general lack of knowledge/interest /understanding in the benefits associated with being in the EU, or for more base reasons, like nationalism, a view that being anti-Europe makes you *more British*, or through forming opinions on the subject based on the ravings of low quality news papers who engage in EU-bashing for sport.

I'm saying clever people try to inform themselves of the subject matter before forming an opinion, and because of this are probably less likely to be nationalist and less likely to consume sensationalist journalism on the issue.

I say this, because when I've previously challenged people who don't like our membership of the EU on their knowledge of the benefits, they've often been unable to advance one benefit of the EU, yet are firm in their beliefs.

I'm not saying that if you're not pro-EU you're thick, I'm saying if you're thick, imo, you're more likely to not be pro-EU. I fully accept that clever people, having fully informed themselves of the positives and negatives, and having attached their own weight to each, may come to the conclusion that membership is a bad thing: and that's fine - I wish that every anti-EU person fell into this category, but sadly this isn't the case.

The UK aren't really willing participants in the EU project so the Democrats think they need to choose the EU over the UK. This is why Obama said the USA has no greater friend than France. It doesn't really make sense given that the last time they had a close alliance was when France was still a kingdom, but it does if you look at the policies that the French and the Democrats wish to follow. The Democrats don't look at history to inform the future as they're a lot more ideological; they're a lot more utopian. As far as they are concerned, an alliance with socialist France would be better than one with conservative Britain.

The Republicans, it seems, look at in more of a sense of loyalty, history and kinship. We have been their greatest ally since the start of the 20th century and helped them out the most during the Cold War and Gulf Wars. I think it's easier for a conservative to try to hold on to past alliance and friendships than a progressive because  a conservative is used to looking at the past as an informant of the future.

true,davegod,uk,United Kingdom,"You're probably thinking of employee (EE) NIC, which is deducted from your salary and the reason why our basic income tax rate is really about 32%. 

However employers also pay (ER) NIC tax on your pay at 13.8%. This is not deducted from your pay, but is calculated based on your pay. Taken literally, ""you"" are not paying this tax, the employer foots the bill. However, there is an *argument* that you could take the view that employers are concerned about total payroll cost when they set wage rates, therefore you pay rate is ~13.8% lower than they are willing to pay for you, therefore we actually have a basic tax rate of ~45.8%. This argument might seem a bit of a stretch, but there's a government thinktank considering doing away with NIC and doing it all through regular tax. If they were to do away with ER NIC, they would probably have to mandate that all salaries are increased by ~13.8% in order that they can then deduct it again through taxation, in order to leave the employee with the same net pay and the government with the same net tax income. 

Anyway, the employer ""based"" offshore does not fall under the UK tax regime theregore avoids the ER NIC. The  the employee is based in UK thus does not avoid the EE NIC. Only the EE NIC is counted for the pension (I *very vaguely* recall they are doing away with the need to have contributed anyway).

I think it boils down to competition. As a new nation, America really needed to assert itself and get noticed. It's difficult to imagine it now, but England was the America of its day. If you want to show you're the big-man, you go for the bloke at the top. It's almost like small-man syndrome; an inferiority complex. You feel like you need to prove yourself to others in order to be validated. It's why new countries almost always go to war straight away. Germany did, Italy did, South Sudan did only months ago.

Eventually the USA, with a population five times that of the UK, decided she wanted to be the top dog. She couldn't compete with the Empire or Britain's mighty industry so she felt she needed to undermine the UK; break up the empire and take over her industry. I doubt it was personal; just business and perhaps a little jealousy.

America is a very insecure country; there is no American nation but rather mixes of many different peoples of different races, creeds and colours spread over incredibly diverse climates. Countries don't naturally form that way: they have to be manufactured. That's why the 'American Dream' and 'American Values' have to be pushed so hard: it's the only thing that can be shared between the vastly diverse and sparse population. An inner-city black family from New York, a rural white family from Alabama, a same-sex couple in California and a middle class family in Connecticut can all say they are American and mean completely different things, yet it still binds them together as long as the illusion is maintained. Such instability requires the belief in external threats and the constant interference in foreign politics.

true,Lakey91,null,null,"EU/Europe: Our relationship with Europe is a funny one. We often like to class ourselves as in Europe but not of it. In many ways this is a fair generalisation, but on a grand scale we do share plenty.

I think, and reddit will not like me saying this, the biggest ties in Europe are through Christianity. Christianity's logical outlook on the Universe and notions of divine order gave Europe the scientific advantage over the rest of the world and the culture, architecture, art and even language shared by Europeans is down to our basis in the Christian religion. This is before we look at the foundations of our law. Nearly every principle of laws in Europe comes from the morality of Christendom. I said in my previous post that England and the USA share certain aspects of Protestant culture, but they vary as well in a way they don't with European religion. American Protestantism is very individualistic, very dogmatic. There are hundreds of American denominations, but in Europe you rarely find more than a few in each country. Americans push the idea of personal relationship with God as a friend rather than a father. Luther's precepts on Sola Scriptura and Sola Fide are taken as a fundamental part of faith and it leads to extreme and scripturally illiterate views such as 'Young Earth Creationism', the 'Rapture' and even 'God Hates Fags'. This is also because Christianity is also seen as part of the definition of 'being an American'. I said in a previous post that there is no American nation and they struggle to maintain unity. Well if you can't form a unified nation naturally by being the same race, then you can form one by being the same religion. This partly explains their attitude towards neo-atheists. When they say that evolution disproves God or that religion is the root of all evil, most people would respond with ""That's a load of mal-informed rubbish"". In America, neo-atheists aren't just attacking religion, but also what are perceived as American values. The response is a lot more defensive because the attack is even more personal. Rather than responding to ""Evolution disproves God"" with ""That's a load of mal-informed rubbish"" they respond with ""Well evolution must be wrong then"". European religion is more at peace with itself. Whilst the religious wars of the 'enlightenment' were mostly about asserting national dominance (""attacking Protestantism is attacking Germany, UK etc./Attacking Catholicism is attacking Spain, Italy etc.), the association between religion and nation in Europe is now not so entrenched.

One of the big problems we do face is language and culture. Language teaching in the UK is awful, thus it's rare to come across anyone outside of private education who can speak a foreign language fluently. Thus, there is little to no market for French television programmes, German films or Spanish music. Without such links, it's really easy to allow a culture gap to form; whilst Britishers and Americans can understand or at least recognise each others idiosyncrasies, European humour, film styles and celebrities are completely foreign to us (pun intended).

BR seems to have a clear focus and a plan for how he wants his team to play and who fits in. Hopefully in January we see a little more development in the structure of the team. And hopefully BR has enough success to remain here for a long time -- setting a standard and an expectation of how one should play at Liverpool.

I mean, all you did was describe Britain. You said ""any country that was [description of Britain] would have done what Britain did.""

It's like saying ""Sure, Muhammed Ali was probably the greatest boxer ever, but any man who could float like a butterfly and sting like a bee, who was fast as its humanly possible to be, who had a punching power like a sledge hammer, was born at the right time, right place, had the right training, team and management, the right attitude, the never-give-up never-say-die resolve and dedication to his sport could have done what he did"", as if that somehow discredits him.

The point is that *no one* else had all those things, that's *why* he was the greatest boxer.

Any country which was a global superpower, on an easily defensible island, with thousands of years of civilisation, powerful navy and army, and the forefront of technology and engineering could have done what Britain did... maybe... but, *only* Britain had all those qualities.

I can't see how it makes sense to talk of things in that light. If we imagine Poland to be a global superpower, on an easily defensible island, with thousands of years of civilisation, powerful navy and army, and the forefront of technology and engineering, then all we are imaging is Poland... being Britain.

true,I_R_RILEY,null,null,"This may sound weird, but it may be best to skip Eccleston at first. The first few episodes of the new series are a bit cheesy and the show is still trying to find it's footing. I've gotten many friends into the show by having them watch Season 3 Episode 11 ""Blink"" then following it up with Season 4 Episode 11 ""Midnight""  and maybe Season 2 Episode 5 ""The Girl in the fireplace"" (*those episode numbers are according to Netflix*). Three standalone episodes that have little to do with the overarching story and are filled with perfect examples of why I like the show. David Tennant's Doctor is a bit more approachable and the show has figured itself out by the time he takes over. 
  
  ""Blink"" is a perfect starter because of it's content, which I won't get into here because of spoilers. It's told from an outside perspective and that's exactly what a new viewer needs.
 
 ""Midnight"" is another standalone, and it's creepy as hell. It also shows a lot of the weird humor the show is capable of and reveals a ton about who the Doctor is as a character. 

  ""The Girl in the Fireplace"" is another wonderful standalone and shows a bit of the weird time travel rules the doctor needs to follow, and is generally an amazing episode. It also shows his love of companions and his interactions with them.

  If you enjoy those two episodes but still aren't ready to start at Eccleston I would suggest trying  ""The Impossible Planet"" &amp; it's 2nd part ""The Satan Pit"" and then jump back to a later Eccleston episode called ""the Empty Child"" and it's 2nd Part ""The Doctor Dances""

  Hopefully that works, it's a really great show once you figure it out. Unfortunately Eccleston's first episodes don't really do the rest of the show justice. There's a lot of cheesy story and special effects in there, but once you get to know the show better and go back everything makes a lot more sense.If none of that works you can always try jumping into season 5 with Matt Smith. He's also a lot more approachable, but I highly suggest Tennant. 

  *I do something similar while trying to get friends into Stargate SG-1. I start them out with S4 EP6 ""Window of Opportunity"". It's a standalone, it's funny as hell, and it explains simple concepts and character relationships quickly. I then start jumping my friends into different episodes and eventually starting them on either a full story arc somewhere, or actually beginning from the first episode. SG-1 suffers from the same problem as Doctor Who: They're both weird and clunky at first, but it later becomes crazy well written, with amazing characters and fun stories*",0,1352047553,null,0,false,0,c6w98m1,t3_12m5pp,t1_c6w98m1,t3_12m5pp,null,1435672726,12,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,12

if you wanted to just watch select episodes that are standalone good. I would also recommend Blink. It barely involves the doctor, so there's not a real need to have all the background that may have been built it, but it's really good. 

If you like those, then go back and watch them in order, cause there is a lot of stuff that builds up slowly, or is eluded to in the early episodes, so it's good to catch it. And hopefully you'll be able to trudge through the more tedious episodes in the beginning to better appreciate the series as a whole.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;How exactly do they protect themselves? lynch mobs? there certainly won't be any law courts or prisons, it will be more like executions without trial

How does any group of individuals protect itself?  By peaceful routes where possible and violent ones where absolutely necessary.  We already do this much of the time, but some of it is outsourced to the State - especially as regards protecting capitalist interests.  This would no longer be an option under anarchism, and people would need to be responsible individually and collectively for all their protection needs.  This isn't a wacky notion, nor is it a call for 'mob justice' - after all, the police, judges, courts, prisons etc. are just people and institutions, however they are currently top-down hierarchical and capitalist in form, they need to be reconsidered in the light of a scrupulous distrust of unjustified authority and rebuilt as and where absolutely necessary from the bottom up.  

Anarchists are rightly critical of the role of policing, law, courts and prisons; they function to serve capitalist masters and deliver capitalist justice.  But there is nothing inherent in anarchism preventing any and/or all of these ideas carrying through into an anarchist society so long as each is ruthlessly subjected to comprehensive critique of its claim to authority and power.  

Without capitalism, a large percentage of crime simply goes away - stealing is pointless if you can possess what you need but not more than you can occupy and use.  Clearly there will still be those who are mentally ill (albeit, again capitalist relations affect mental health in very negative ways so we could expect some reduction in the proportions of the mentally unwell), and a small core of people who are just bad (violent, anti-social, etc.).  How we as an anarchist society handle these people is a field which has generated much discussion and several interesting models.  Generally speaking, any policing necessary would be predominantly handled by the community concerned, according to their locally agreed rules and procedures.  One would expect any courts to function in an anarchist fashion, which would entail juries, possibly with expert advisors as necessary, but no professional judges.  Imprisonment or execution would be an unacceptable form of punishment for any genuinely libertarian communities except as a last resort to protect a them from a significant violent or existential threat.",0,1352048189,null,0,false,0,c6w9e2u,t3_12kd13,t1_c6w9e2u,t1_c6w8dmt,null,1430317385,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,KnownForNothing,lfc99,,"Same stuff all over again. A lot of chances, one goal. Luis Suarez being a boss again. Some of my **honest** opinions on the game:

+ Gerrard really, really, wants a goal. He took quite a few shots that either were blocked or went wide. It's his 600th appearance and all, but he needs to calm down and take shots at the right time. Besides that, his passing was exceptional.

+ Sterling was great. Unfortunately, he has the tendancy to go down easily at times or lash out at someone viciously, like how he tried to kick that Newcastle player. Hoping he grows out of it. Not going to take anything away from him, he was brilliant today.

+ Suarez was brilliant as always. There needs to be more people in the box when he gets the ball. Quite a few times he's been forced wide and tries to send a low cross in only for it to hit a Newcastle player or go all the way through.

+ Shelvey... needs some finishing classes. That glorious opportunity presented to him on a plate by Suarez right after his goal should have been buried. Downing also sent an uncharacteristically good cross which found Shelvey, only to have him head it straight at Krul. He has a knack for getting in those positions, but he needs to finish well. It's not just this game, he also failed to do anything with that brilliant diagonal cross a while back.

+ Enrique was very hit and miss, but mostly miss. He did do a few good things, but the amount of mistakes that he's made far outweighs the good things he did.

+ Sahin was very good in the opening of the second half. Him, Suarez and Sterling tore apart the defence with clever passing and dribbles.

+ Suso was amazingly solid in the first half, shame he went off.

+ Wisdom was... *meh*.

+ Jones was pretty good.

+ Allen uncharacteristically lost possession a lot more than usual, but made a few good interceptions. Felt like he wasn't up to his usual game, but he was great at picking up loose balls.

+ Skrtel and Agger were quite solid.

true,tumblebee_incline,null,null,"Some pointers from my side- 

Well, great second half from Liverpool. Overall, a lackluster display from Liverpool and Newcastle. Liverpool should have scored the winner. I have a feeling the young players are too keen on the ball, lacking the calmness.
Besides, some pointers-

1) Gerrard- He was doing allright, sometimes even brilliant in the first half till that goal by Cabaye was scored. After that, just awful. Second half, he comes roaring back, and in the final 15-20 min was finally refreshing to see him take first touches for himself and chase the ball. It was like he had a spring and flashes of 2009 season. That 50 yard pass for sterling, simply class apart. Overall, very good. Still suffers from lapse of concentration and general confidence.

2) Suarez- i am not going to say anything about him. He was just magnificent. That control and shoot. Its clear that with some support, he 's gonna be really really terrific. Should have got more support from sterling and suso.

3) Why isn't suso being played behind Suarez. Its clear that suso lacks pace and is too eager on the ball. He's just too young. His low paced jinking runs and the clever through balls are his trademark. And for that he needs to play behind the second striker. Anyways, rightly substituted.

4) Sahin- Seriously he has an amazing football brain as one can see from his tackling intentions and sometimes clever through balls. But the guy lacks the strength and hold up play required in premiership. He lost possession far too often today. His sliding challenges are awesome though. Rightly substituted.

5) Enrique- what the f is wrong with him. Gives the ball away cheaply. Plays beautiful long balls both aerial and ground. Has nice pace. But for a left back, he should not the give away the ball so cheaply. Seeing glen johnson to come back for the next match.

6) Allen- uncharacteristically poor today. It was more a case of anticipation. He anticipated and players didn't respond.

7) Wisdom- Will grow. Bright future ahead. Good aerially.

8) Sterling- The kid is special. I know its wrong to expect much more from him, but common you gotta finish your chances man.

9) Jones, Agger, Skrtel - Very good all of them. Jones could not have done anything with that goal. But his distribution is poor. Agger with his trademark bursting run is a treat to watch, this guy is pure class on the ball and Skrtel is pure class in positioning. Liverpool are really lucky to have them both.

Shelvey- He does not give the ball cheaply. This guy is gonna be great, if only he controls his temper and bad tackling ability. Should have scored twice. He is also too eager on the ball. Needs to relax.

Rodgers must understand that these are kids, and kids are bound to get bullied by physical players from newcastle. Newcastle were constantly throwing bodies on goal bound shots. A little hold up and then shot, take a little touch on a ball and then shoot, its always going to help. I love the youth players we have and if they develop a sensible cool head, they are gonna be great.

I am just really frustrated today, bcoz yes we played bad, but in those last 10 min, the pressure that we created was so much that 1 goal should have been had.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Did you try from the start? Maybe try from the start of Season 5 - the writing changed a lot and although the Doctor Who fanbase seems divided between the two showrunners, I'm of the opinion that it improved a lot in terms of character development and stories. And if you don't want to watch all of it, you might want to check out a few of the cooler episodes - ""The Empty Child""/""The Doctor Dances"" (double episode), ""The Girl in the Fireplace"", ""Blink"", ""The Doctor's Daughter"", ""Midnight"", ""Vincent and the Doctor"", ""The Lodger"" (has James Corden in it), ""The Doctor's Wife"" (written by Neil Gaiman), ""Closing Time"" (pretty average episode, but has James Corden again), and ""Asylum of the Daleks"".

I don't have the episode numbers for them, but they're in chronological order, and most of them are almost stand-alone episodes (don't really require huge prior knowledge). Some of them are especially beautiful - The Girl in the Fireplace and Vincent and the Doctor are just lovely to watch, and total tearjerkers if you watch them in the right mood. Others are funny (The Lodger), and others are just really odd and interesting (The Doctor's Wife). The Doctor's Daughter has a very interesting sociological concept that I won't spoil but fascinated me more than the actual storyline of the episode.

Basically, although you might like the series as a whole, some of the episodes are really lovely to watch as individuals.",0,1352055248,null,0,false,0,c6wb8hr,t3_12m5pp,t1_c6wb8hr,t1_c6w8udr,null,1430318262,2,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,2

My point is that any person being shown ads or propaganda or whatever of any kind should not feel like they just have to accept their exposure to it without question or modification. Okay, writing 'as a corpse' on a poster is and should be defined as vandalism, I will concede that, but that's not the important point, the point I'm arguing is that it's not a negative action and somebody tearing the corner off to preserve the original message should not be accepted just because not being allowed to vandalise != censorship.

So how somebody who grew up in Liverpool, who would have watched every game since the day he was born, who knew nothing but Liverpool for his whole childhood, who even played for them and became the Kop's hero and messiah, how in the fuck does somebody go from that to what this turd is today ??

true,tinytitan,null,null,"""They"" as in... the show creators? Obviously they don't want to kill anyone yet, but they have to keep up the suspense that someone could die at any moment. Plus that just acts as a way to pull at the emotions of the characters, if they're all worrying about someone dying slowly. If it is more drawn out, it's likely that the characters will hurt more, be conflicted about what to do, but also have time to consult with Gaius, or druids, etc until a witty remedy is found.

If ""they"" as in the characters-- well I think no doubt Arthur would be willing to use his knightly skills to kill someone. We have seen him kill countless characters. Merlin, however, I think still isn't ready to kill someone. Maybe he isn't as powerful as we think. He might be powerful in the sense of morality, wisdom, etc instead of strictly magically powerful. He is trying to redeem the good name of magic after all; not use it as a means to harm people. It might be counter-intuitive if he uses magic to murder people, while on the side trying to be like ""Arthur, you should embrace magic; we are kind and good people who should be treated as equals!""
