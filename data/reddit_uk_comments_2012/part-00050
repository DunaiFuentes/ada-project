I'm a student at Kent and I grew up in the Chichester area. I'd recommended getting the train to see one another and going via the city of Brighton (it is cheaper than going through London). Additionally, buy train tickets that are 'open return', which means that you can travel to and then return back within 1 month and 'offpeak' means after 9am (as before 9am is peak travel and often twice as expensive).

It is about £15-16ish offpeak open return from Canterbury to Sussex with something called a 'Young Person's Railcard' - it saves you a third of the cost off of tickets. You do have to pay for it, but the savings you make pay it off quite quick.

Oddly enough, I'm leaving for America for a year abroad :)

Despite its size, Lincoln somehow manages to cram in everything bigger towns have.

If you prefer the nightlife, being a student town, there are plenty of clubs and we also have a pretty good local music scene that can be found in the smaller pubs such as the Jolly Brewer which has regular live music and open mic nights.

If you like walking, there are several parks and commons. The cathedral being right on top of the only hill makes for an excellent view.

* Castle Terrace (right underneath the castle - in the city centre).
* Number one @ the Balmoral (I've been here and it was quite good, though I am quite hard to please!  I expected a bit more for the price &amp; considering it was a michelin star jobbie).

I think the Kitchin is generally considered the best out of the lot though check out the reviews of them all on google/tripadvisor.

As for stuff to avoid (in my opinion) that probably falls into the splurge category here are a few:

* The Tower is up its own arse as far as I could tell, the food was quite good but not as good as the balmoral (and one has to assume the other michelin starred ones I mentioned above).  Great views to the castle though, it's almost going just for the view (make sure to get a castle view table).

* Oloroso - Food was OK but I expected better given the hype this place had received at the time (2010 ish I think).  Again, nice views from this roof top venue but generally I think this place thinks it's better than it really is.

I'll be sad on Roy's behalf if he takes the job. He was doing great at Fulham, then left to take a job that he probably wasn't suited for, at a time when it was an impossible job anyway. I don't think he was ever the right man to manage Liverpool but nobody would have survived the turmoil of the ownership débacle and new owners who surely wanted to put in their own man. He was set up to fail, and he failed.

Now he's doing a really fantastic job at West Brom; a couple more years and he could have a firmly established mid-table side who are thinking more about the UEFA cup than relegation. But he's going to leave for a job where, whether he's the right man or not, he's being set up to fail.

I think Hodgson's best role is in organising players to function as a team, drilling them so they rarely get out of shape, are hard to score against, and always play the probabilities in attack. That gets the best out of most players, but the creative geniuses are stifled. He'd fail at a team like Man City where half the players are brilliant and should be encouraged to just do their thing. He failed at Liverpool when he had a mostly weak squad that needed to rely on a couple of outstanding players to get anything out of a game. Given time, he could make an effective (but not outstanding) team out of your Poulsens and Koncheskys. He would be the ideal manager for the legendary ""team of Carraghers"" we all dream of.

I'm not sure if that's the right approach for an international manager, who doesn't get to work with the players week in, week out. My instinct says no, although Roy's record as an international manager is good.

It doesn't matter, because he won't have a chance. The media wants Harry Redknapp and the only analysis we need is Roy != Harry. They will be on to him like a pack of jackals. Whatever he says will be wrong, whatever he wears will be inappropriate. His body-language will be over-analysed (and frankly, they won;t have to work too hard to find something to make mock of there). He'll get the worst treatment we've seen since Graham Taylor and if he wins Euro 2012 the credit will go to the Spurs players in the squad and how well they channelled the Redknapp magic.",0,1335784660,null,0,false,0,c4ia9j1,t3_sz0k0,t1_c4ia9j1,t3_sz0k0,null,1428825501,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11

Also factoring in the cost of migrations and software development and enterprise level linux licensing and maintenance and trained linux staff, it doesnt always add up to switch to linux.

Microsoft software is well known, well integrated and mature. It's actually very reliable.

Where it makes sense Linux does get used, but introducing new platforms and having to integrate them into existing estate is time-consuming and costly and this is why Linux hasn't taken over the world. Software tends to be just a slice of the overall cost of running systems.

Microsoft have an outsanding platform, .Net is a fantastic development environment.

Microsoft also properly license all of their third party code in the time honoured fashion.

For instance, a few months ago me and my friends all went out and went back to a friends house to carry on drinking so we all stayed there. One of the girls and me stayed in a bed together but didn't do anything. At about 7 in the morning her ex-boyfriend starts ringing her phone demanding to know where she is, really angry. She tells him and in half an hour he's outside bashing on the front door. Nobody answers so he keeps banging and banging and eventually kicked it down. We're all in bed still, and he enters the house illegally, storms up the stairs, kicks all the bedroom doors down and finds me and her in the same room. At this monent I'm sitting down putting my shoes on to go tell him to fuck off. Queue direct kick to the face splitting eyebrow and another massively splitting lip. Both these impacts have caused permanent and horrible scars. Then he gives me a few punches, I get up and start pushing him away, out of the room. He then grabs me and throws me down the stairs like a rag doll. At the bottom he then stamps on my leg and my chest, breaking my ankle and four of my ribs and then walking out the house. Everyone has got out of bed because of the noise and just saw this watching in shock. One of the girls phones the police and they come in about half an hour with an ambulance. This house is located not a 30 second drive from a hospital. By now the adrenaline has worn off and I am in severe pain, five people give witness statements and I spend a few days in the hospital and a month off work. All because a jealous ex-boyfriend got drunk. Five witness statements and hospital records is apparently not enough though, as the whole thing got thrown out due to lack of evidence. Complaining to the police the only answer they could give me was that it was because the accused' statement was radically different from the others. ""You don't say? You mean he lied on his statement? Well fuck me."" It was blatent that they did not care and just wanted to throw it out.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Microsoft#Vendor_lock-in

&gt; From its inception, Microsoft defined itself as a platform company and understood the importance of attracting third-party programmers. It did so by providing development tools, training, access to proprietary APIs in early versions, and partner programs. Although the resulting ubiquity of Microsoft software allows a user to benefit from network effects, critics decry what they consider to be an ""embrace, extend and extinguish"" **strategy by Microsoft of adding proprietary features to open standards**, thereby using its market dominance to gain de facto ownership of standards ""extended"" in this way

And they haven't changed  - see the OOXML standard also...

If you read the present article you will see Microsoft actively ~~paid~~ lobbied the government to **NOT !!!** use open standards - how in the hell is this being 'instrumental in the development of many open standards' .... It is more like 100% the opposite.

In developing something like, say, a tablet PC there is an entire stack of value-add:

# Design of the CPU (most complex part of any such product), and test. The resultant product of this stage is RTL - hardware source code.
# Similarly with the GPU which is quickly becoming more and more complex.
# Design of peripherals and test. Peripherals here doesn't mean mice and keyboards and stuff, but things that go on the same chip such as memory controllers, cache interconnects and busses.
# Laying out these components such that they will fit on a chip (all tablet and mobile devices use a System-on-chip (SoC) where everything goes on the same die), and laying them out for a particular ""process"", which is the size of each transistor on the chip. This is currently around 20nm and has to be done differently for each process.
# Fabrication of the chip.
# Writing or porting operating systems and software to run on the hardware.
# Finally, app vendors write user apps that run on the operating system.

Each of those stages is like a pipeline that takes around 4 years from start to finish. At each stage, ""value"" is added but the way it works is that the earlier in the pipeline the value is added, the less it is worth.

ARM only do the first three (CPU and GPU design, and physical implementation). The business model is to sell cheaply to many silicon vendors who then add their own value/IP to differentiate themselves from their competitors. Because historically we haven't advertised ARM as a brand widely, semi partners could all buy from us without fear of being labelled similar to their competition - they could compete on other fronts while still cost-sharing by essentially outsourcing their CPU design to ARM.

Intel does pretty much the whole stack - it designs CPUs, GPUs, preps them for physical implementation, and fabricates them itself - it owns factories and facilities for all of this. Therefore, the product they sell (a chip with CPU/GPU on it) is higher up the value chain when they sell it and they can add a higher markup. The price of an Intel processor when you buy it is pretty much exactly what they sell it for - there's only a retail vendor (or someone like Dell) in between. The equivalent revenue from an ARM based device would have to be shared between multiple partners who added value along the way.

That said, that's also Intel's weakness - it thrives on monopoly. Internally ARM management harp on all the time about the ""ARM ecosystem"", which essentially means the massive number of companies we somehow sell to. *We* don't need ourselves to compete with Intel - actually it's the ""ARM ecosystem"" versus Intel, and our partners are *huge* companies. (a bit like hiding behind big kids you've paid off against the school bully...)

Intel is also having difficulty adapting its business model to mobile. As I mentioned earlier, System-on-chips are what mobile requires due to power and space constraints, but that means that everything the phone needs from every vendor needs to be on the same chip. If intel were to try and sell to Samsung, for example, Samsung would want to put its own stuff on that chip too to differentiate its product from its competition.

Which is difficult, because Intel owns the fabrication plants used to manufacture Intel chips, and that would require either Intel giving its designs in RTL form to Samsung or Samsung giving its stuff in RTL form to Intel and Intel doing the layout and fab for them.

Because ARM deals around licencing its intellectual property for licence fee and royalty instead of the almost Apple-like approach of dominating the entire process, it can deal better with mobile.

That said, I'm sure Intel will sort something out soon.",0,1335789658,null,0,false,0,c4iaps1,t3_sychg,t1_c4iaps1,t1_c4iafea,null,1428825712,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

A good example of that is the two-button mouse, which Microsoft invented in order to get around Apple's patent on the mouse (which had one button at the time). Similarly on Windows, one had to click on a menu in order for it to drop down, whereas on a different OS (I forget which) it would come down just by hovering the mouse. It was getting around a patent.

Companies such as microsoft do add value, and get patents when they do. I'm not saying that the US patent system isn't totally broken, but they're certainly not trolls. Trolls buy patents without having put in the work themselves or having any product using them, and suing over them.

Your links describe patents on UI design, which is a difficult one. Many things don't need full patents because their inner workings can be disguised, hidden or obfuscated. Google's search algorithms are a good example. However user interfaces are by design not able to be hidden, and companies such as Apple spend an awful lot of time making interfaces that work naturally, employing specialists and doing lots of surveys and academic work.

Actually you see the advanced stages of this in some towns. I was in Sittingbourne not to long ago and it was phone shops, pound stores, arcades. Giant out of town stores were built that just sucked the life out of the town.

And it amazes me how many of these people say they're skint.

&gt; Why are the English content with eating and drinking dishes without taste or substance when we want a day to day meal served up within a reasonable price?

Because people don't want to take responsibility. It's easier for it to be someone else's fault. I can make a meal at home far superior to 90% of restaurants I can visit in London, and I'd say almost 100% of restaurants in my local town, or the next one, or the next one after that.

&gt; Why is it that Simon Cowell can make a TV show designed to humiliate and dumb down the population and we lap it up and are left wanting more, but only if we don’t have to think, and only if we are going to be told we should like it.

Can you imagine what might happen if people were shown media that tells them real things about the real world? Things that would make them think? They wouldn't watch it. People don't want to learn. They go to work, come home and want to switch off. I no longer have a TV because of the bilge that's spewed out. If there's anything I want to watch I can usually find it online.

true,TipsyScales,tennant,Tennant,"It's really hard for me to choose episodes for ten, since he's had the longest run and a lot of great stories. 

**Ninth Doctor**

1. The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances - This is one of my favorite episodes of all time. You get the show's first truly unsettling monster, a mystery with a really brilliant explanation, the introduction of Captain Jack and, of course, everybody lives!
2. Father's Day - This was the first episode that really showed me what kind of emotion Doctor Who was capable of. It also gave some nice insight into Rose and showed us the consequences of messing around with time.
3. Dalek - I've liked this more on subsequent rewatches than I did the first time for some reason, but it was a brilliant introduction to the Daleks.
4. Bad Wolf/The Parting of the Ways - A solid ending. Not a perfect season finale but the game show stuff was fun, the Daleks felt threatening and Bad Wolf was a pretty cool twist.
5. Rose - Like the way we get the intro to Rose's life before we meet the Doctor. 

**Tenth** 

1. Human Nature/The Family of Blood - This is my favorite episode of the show in general. Not sure exactly why is struck such a chord but the ending was absolutely perfect. It also gave me a bit more respect for Martha, who  is generally a companion I don't feel much about.
2. Blink - Self-explanatory I think. This episode is just creepy as hell and brilliantly executed. 
3. The Fires of Pompeii - This might be a weird choice, but I love Donna in it and the themes it deals with set up as a precursor to the whole Time Lord Victorious ordeal that goes down later in Waters of Mars.
4. Tooth and Claw - Might be another odd choice, but I really dig werewolves and thought it gelled pretty well considering they're more of a fantasy than a sci fi element. Also, love Rose's messing with Queen Victoria.
5. Partners in Crime - Really love Donna, and this episode was both hilarious and a perfect reintroduction.

**Eleventh**

1. The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang - Great season finale that tied everything together very well. Great monologue, nice use of the timey wimey stuff and the intro of the fez.
2. The Rebel Flesh/The Almost People - Really nice balance between somber and wacky, especially regarding the double Doctor situation.
3. The Eleventh Hour - Great intro for Matt Smith. After Tennant I was very skeptical but this episode was great and eased the transition.
4. The Impossible Astronaut/The Day of the Moon - The Silence are probably one of the creepiest villains the show has come up with and this whole two parter is fast paced and awesome.
5. The Lodger - This was just extremely fun and served as a deeper look at the Doctor's interaction with humanity. ",0,1335790736,null,0,true,0,c4iau5u,t3_szb8c,t1_c4iau5u,t3_szb8c,null,1428825770,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

I really enjoyed David Tennant, you get to see a wide range of emotions from him that he portrays really well from heart break and loneliness to anger and happiness. He showed a wide range of things and how a Time Lord thinks and reacts to things, I think his emotion is what people like (well and he is pretty attractive) He showed a pretty human side of The Doctor while still being clever and fulfilling his duties as a Time Lord. I just started season 5 and so far I am really enjoying Matt Smith he is a bit eccentric and Hyperactive, ADHD even but he brings his own personality and emotions which makes him interesting to still watch and enjoy the show. 

David Tennant will probably be my favorite Doctor but I'm not going to say If he isn't the Doctor the show sucks or I won't watch it.

Microsoft have worked against open standards for the last decade and a half.


No they haven't, they developed the SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) standard for a start, a method for disparate systems, platforms and applications interface with one another, exposing APIs over HTTP kickstarted the software as a service revolution, it made interoperability a fucking breeze. 

THAT'S AN OPEN STANDARD!

They have released all the file format specification for their office platform for others to develop their own office platform. 

http://www.microsoft.com/openspecifications/en/us/programs/osp/office-file-formats/default.aspx

The issues raised by groklaw are around continuing to develop these ooxml standards, surely that is now up to the open source community to do, rather than just leech off the achievements of others to go on and develop something of your own as mozilla did with Netscape.

and here are the specifications they have given to the open standards communities

http://www.microsoft.com/openspecifications/en/us/programs/osp/published-protocols/default.aspx

Microsoft are actively involved in open standards committees for hardware, interoperability, networking protocols, design and web protocols. 

They have even tolerated someone else making an identical version of .Net, Mono, that runs on Linux.

Hampering open standards you're talking nonsense frankly, your views are outdated, Microsoft has been increasingly open to the open standards community. 


In fact controlling previously existing open standards has been the game plan since the mid 90's see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_Documents


You'll notice the last of these documents is eight years old, and this all happened a long time ago. A lot of things have changed since then and Microsoft has clearly embraced open standards. See above.


If you read the present article you will see Microsoft actively paid lobbied the government to NOT !!! use open standards - how in the hell is this being 'instrumental in the development of many open standards' .... It is more like 100% the opposite.


This is absolutely normal and standard business practice, weren't IBM, Sun, Oracle AND Netscape paying large donations to Senators to support hauling Microsoft before the US Justice System in the US back in the late 90s over some minor contractual issues, in order to gain market share and attack Microsoft through the court system rather than make compelling easy to use software. Microsoft got sat on for a few years and the strategy got them market share.

This is effectively the same thing the Free Software / Open Source community is trying to do now. Rather than making their software compelling and easy to use software, they are trying to barge their way in through various committees. 

It's all been tried before. It isn't going to work, the free software community still hasn't made their platforms so easy and simple to use that anyone can pick it up, very often you will find yourself having to traverse the vagaries of archaic command line syntax. This may be suitable for an expert but it isnt suitable for an end user. 

This debate isn't about Microsoft preventing Open Standards but about licensing terminology and about choice rather than locking perfectly fine proprietary software from being locked out by the Free Software forcing its way into government departments which will create confusion, great expense and may even lead to many job losses and require a completely different set of skills than government departments have at their disposal. 

Also the truth is the greatest amount of innovation in the industry has come from the proprietary software world. Linux is basically a clone of Unix. Free software takes the efforts of others, copies them and then passes them off as their own, it is hardly at the forefront of innovation. This has even in the past stretched to simply taking the work of others, for example the Truetype fonts issues a few years ago. 

tl;dr This is not about Microsoft actively fighting open standard this is about Microsoft trying to prevent proprietary software from being locked out of government contracts. it is about the Free Software associations from finding a backdoor to enforcing their software on government departments which may not have the right knowledge to deploy, manage and develop against them. There is a good reason why this isnt a good idea, Linux isnt ready to take over the world because it is not yet compelling enough and is still difficult to use.

The more you can sell at once, the less risk there is in terms of law enforcement. Less people to inform the police on you. 

Getting the high level contacts might be hard, but I'm sure there's internet sites nowadays that can help with this. I know of a few onion sites that were very popular with people selling multiple KG of various drugs. 

I hazard a guess that even a newbie could get 80Kg ever 4 months from a 1000 square feet unit. 

£2500 per kilo (low ball estimate) is 200K every 4 months. If you include all the associated bolllocks and clearing up and various other time wasters you could probably manage 2 crops a year. £400K a year with a maximum penalty of 14 years, but me as someone with a totally clean record could expect a lot less than that even for a big op. 

Seems worth the risk for a few years, doesn't it? 

I estimate the cost of each grow including the unit rent of about £6500 all in all.  Not including the kitting out of the unit though.

Is absolute bullshit, piracy doesn't do 'much' damage to any industry, shown not only by the growth of them, but also the fact that services like Spotify have become massive successes in a short space of time.

true,patnevin,null,null,"Right, I've got quiet a detailed manifesto as to what would make us both competitive immediately and also lay foundations for future success for the PL Saints.

Positions we need to strengthen:

Goalkeeper: Davis is no spring chicken, need a younger 'keeper willing to be a backup but would grow into a good keeper who can be first choice for some time to come.

**Targets: Jack Butland (Birmingham), Fraser Forster (Newcastle).**

Right-back: Don't think Butterfield can make the step-up, nor do I think Richardson is defensively solid enough to be able to play in every fixture next season. As with most positions, I'd prefer someone young and hungry to come in and compete. Not sure if Dale Stephens is ready to step up yet.

**Targets: Nathaniel Clyne (Crystal Palace), Kieran Trippier (Burnley), Jack Hunt (Huddersfield)**

Centre-back: We have two good first team centre-backs in Jose Fonte and Jos Hooiveld, but both have their limitations. Fonte not being as impressive as he was in League One, I feel we ought to find another first-team centre-back, with us then having a new player, Fonte, Hooiveld and Martin competing for first-team spots. This is one position where experience could be quite useful.

**Targets: Curtis Davies (Birmingham City), Rhys Williams (Middlesbrough),  Scott Dann (Blackburn Rovers), Roger Johnson (Wolverhampton Wanderers)**

Right midfield: A position in which we've been lacking consistency. Guly could possibly excel in a league with more time on the ball, but I feel he'd more likely succeed in a central position. Similarly, De Ridder and Puncheon could make an impact, but differing reasons have precluded them from making right midfield their own. Richard Chaplow is not a genuine right midfielder and ought not to be deployed as such.

**Targets: Matt Phillips (Blackpool), Nathan Redmond (Birmingham City), Matt Jarvis (Wolverhampton Wanderers)**

Central Midfield: We've got two excellent prospects in Cork and Schneiderlin, both of whom I have confidence in. However, I have reservations over the ability of Hammond and Chaplow to step up and be of the quality required. I think Guly could spring a surprise and do very well, but we could do with someone to come in and bolster our options, with Ward-Prowse unlikely to be able to step up yet.

Targets: **Jacob Butterfield (Barnsley), Jordon Mutch (Birmingham City), Sean Murray (Watford), Rhys Williams (Middlesbrough)**, I think this is a position where we're most likely to look abroad though.

Striker: We have good options in Lambert, Lee, Sharp. But I don't think Guly will be good enough to play up front, Barnard will likely leave, nor do I think that we can rely on Connolly to be fit. As such, another option would be useful. A young striker with pace would be ideal.

Targets: **Gary Hooper (Celtic), Jay Rodriguez (Burnley), Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace), Marvin Sordell (Bolton)**

Some of my targets potentially tend towards the unrealistic, but I don't think they're unattainable.

A perfect summer for me would be bringing in the following: **Jack Butland, Kieran Trippier, Curtis Davies, Rhys Williams, Matt Phillips, Jay Rodriguez.**

I think they'd cost close to (if not slightly more than) £20M, though. ",0,1335797909,null,0,false,0,c4ibw3i,t3_szo3x,t1_c4ibw3i,t3_szo3x,null,1428826267,9,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,9

true,lightsaberon,null,null,"&gt;There are a plethora of technologies in use in most organisations and implemented and managed correctly are often cheaper than linux variants.

Where are all these technologies that are cheaper than linux?

China, India and Brazil are developing world countries and have invested in linux because of its low costs.  Ever read about the frustration of microsoft trying to get Chinese companies to pay for their relatively expensive software?

&gt;cost of migrations and software development and enterprise level linux licensing and maintenance and trained linux staff, it doesnt always add up to switch to linux.

The migration costs of vista were so high that there was a major backlash from industry.  It required the purchasing of much expensive new hardware.  Windows 7 will also incur expensive hardware upgrades for companies using older equipment.  

One of the advantages of linux is its ability to run well on old and cheap hardware.  As security support for old microsoft software dies, linux looks like an ever more attractive option.  

Linux does not need license management.  You can use linux on a million computers without paying anyone anything in license costs. 


&gt;In the survey, Linux admin salaries were slightly higher than Windows admins, with Linux at $71,400 per admin, and Windows at $68,500 per admin. But Linux admins took care of an average of 44 servers and Windows admins an average of 10. So the salary per processing unit was Linux, $12,010, and Windows, $52,060.

[Linux admins can manage more hardware and software and are paid only slightly more](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/linuxs-tco-not-free-but-still-impressive/1060248).  So, they work out being more cost effective.


&gt;Microsoft software is well known, well integrated and mature. It's actually very reliable.

Can you really claim that windows 7 is mature and well integrated?  By the time a company is running in it, windows 8 will probably be released.  

Linux doesn't have this problem, you can upgrade as updates are produced without having to pay at all.

&gt;Where it makes sense Linux does get used, but introducing new platforms and having to integrate them into existing estate is time-consuming and costly and this is why Linux hasn't taken over the world.

Microsoft cuts support for their software after a given time period and companies that use their software are entirely reliant on this one entity to maintain support.  This means that if a company wants to keep up with security updates it has to upgrade both its microsoft software and its hardware.  This is expensive and these costs would be much lower with linux.

For example, IIS7 is only available for windows vista and up.

&gt;Microsoft have an outsanding platform, .Net is a fantastic development environment.

And yet most prefer the open source LAMP framework.

&gt;Microsoft also properly license all of their third party code in the time honoured fashion.

Expensive licensing.

The problem is that 99% of Internet users connect to an ISP and do not run their own router.  The ratio of routers to sites is very low and therefore redundancy is low.

true,istealreceipts,cnty-scotland,Lahndaaan,"Edinburgh population-wise is about 500,000 for the city, whereas Glasgow is around 600,000 city. There is a greater population disparity when you look at the urban and metro figures. When you are looking at the [Greater Glasgow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Glasgow) area the population rises to 1.2 million - but this is a massive area, which includes large towns such as Paisley and Motherwell.

Anyway, the wider area figures don't matter that much anyway, since there's only 40 miles distance between the two cities!

Edinburgh really isn't 'tiny' in comparison to Glasgow. Edinburgh has a smaller city-centre and is a bit easier to traverse - if you are a tourist, this is a great thing.

I am just at odds with the fact that Edinburgh has a lot of people living in the city proper and there isn't that much by way of entertainment for them, apart for a couple of months a year where a bunch of (frankly) overpriced acts appear and command an audience.

I like the museums and galleries in Glasgow much better than those in Edinburgh, simply because Glasgow city council advertise them much more prominently (as do the independent ones) than in Edinburgh. And a bugbear being, that museums in Edinburgh are filled with MASSIVE tourist groups. Not four, five or six people...think twelve to fifteen.

Sucks to say, but I never received any arts literature when I lived in Edinburgh, although I did get lots of leaflets about 'Where your council tax goes'. I think it went on producing the leaflets.

As for bars and restaurants - there's not much difference between the two cities. Plenty of chain places to sate the needs of the tourist hordes and plenty of bistros and gastro-pubs to make the locals feel that they've found a cool hangout.

As I've said, I had the Edinburgh experience for over three years and I'm not the only person who thinks that the city is geared towards tourists, rather than the folk living there.

true,OhWhyBother,null,null,"**&lt;TL;DR&gt; We need to play narrow &amp; compact since Bayern will mostly play wide. Also, having two strikers up front might help cause some problems in Bayern's (somewhat weakened) defense.**

Provided both Torres and Drogba can keep up the same level of performances, I get the feeling that a [somewhat narrow 4-4-2 diamond formation](http://this11.com/topics/add/abCyZ8sakl) might just work...

The above formation relies on two setups: Lamps finding Drogba and Mata linking up with Torres. Mikel provides the defensive pivot while Malouda plays the passer. Using Mata with Drogba is ineffective as recent games have pointed out; Drogba is much better with the route-one longballs - such as the ones Lamps provides, while Torres is better with the through passes - such as the ones Mata provides. Pair either with the other and we have a potential disaster.

Bayern have a compact midfield and rely a lot on their wide-midfielders to push forward and transition into a 4-2-1-3 of sorts which means that CFC will have to be alert on defense. Also, according to who scored both teams attack via the left flank - both RBs will need to be solid. Losing Bane to a yellow-compilation is, clearly, a huge blow for CFC.

However, the same yellow-compilation might also help CFC since Alaba and Badstuber will also be out, i.e. the threat down the left flank is somewhat ameliorated by the absence of Alaba. Badstuber's absence at CB should also help Mata with his tricky through passes.

Bayern play higher up the pitch as compared to Chelsea and are also better on-the-ball. Luckily, Chelsea love defending deep and are relatively better off-the-ball so both situations are somewhat mutually negated. 

IMO, this is potentially where the midfield triangle of Lamps-Malouda-Mikel will come into play. Mikel will have to play the game of his life to keep out the Bayern midfield duo of Schweinsteiger &amp; Dias. Also, Kroos plays just behind the trio of Ribery-Gomez-Robben thus making it an aggressive 4-2-1-3 when Bayern are on the offense. Without JT, Cahill and Luiz are sure to have their hands full marking each of these players. In fact, with both teams falling short on defensive strength, I will be surprised if either of the sides manages to keep a clean sheet.

Why, then, would we need two strikers? Doesn't it make sense to have more defensive players than strikers? Allow me to direct you to Bayern's defensive line: Lahm-Boateng-Badstuber-Alaba. With two of the four out of the finals line-up, pressing Bayern up the pitch and probing for chinks in their armor should get us an early goal. If Rafinha starts at RB, Coles forward-bombing can hopefully keep him occupied. Also, when not in possession, Torres or Drogba can drop back and help with defensive duties, hopefully. 

The key to this game, make no mistake, will be possession. Expect Bayern to move into wider spaces and attack from the flanks, with Ribery and Robben moving into channels and cutting in from the byline. At all times, CFC will need to maintain a compact defense and must be poised to turn-and-break. Since we do not have natural wide players, it makes more sense to rely on creating opportunities by playing through the middle - hence the formation outlined. 

Of course, having Bane and Ramires would have been a HUGE plus but we must do with what we have.

Furthermore, he's not above choosing good over law, when it suits the situation. That issue with the Tesselector? He chose to bend the laws of time.

It seems, though, that you're casting The Doctor as a Lawful Neutral: The law is what it is, and it must be maintained. This doesn't fit his character at all. After all, if he followed the law above all else, he'd have not stolen the TARDIS, he'd have stayed out of the affairs of Earth, he'd have followed the edicts of Lord President Rassilon and allowed all of time to end, and he'd have accepted his fate in the trap at Lake Silencio.

So yes, breaking the laws about ""fixed points in time"" is certainly within his character, if it serves a greater purpose than just the law. The tricky bit is getting away with it.

I loathe this argument. Under the guise of protecting ""new British artists"" the music industry is attempting to justify a defacement of the internet. Yet it is the connectedness of the internet that has served as the true springboard for so much of the ""new British"" talent of the past decade while the record companies secured their own interests and pumped out crap. In 2005 Lily Allen was on myspace giving her music away for free while the old guard of record companies were peddling Push The Button by the Sugababes and the Crazy Frog.

The truth is, the internet is the true positive force for ""new British artists"" while mainstream record companies benefit a tiny, select handful of acts. The BPI would have you believe that they are the be all and end all of British cultural output and development in regards to music. In reality an open internet is the best forum for new, challenging music to be found and for new artists to project themselves. But since this doesn't correlate with the priorities of the BPI, they use their money, influence and connections to damage the single greatest forum for artistic expression there has ever been.

The Angels snap necks so they can speak to the other guards to set traps? Angel Bob talking to the Doctor.  They put a voice to the Angels that was just ridiculous. The Angels were frightening because they had no voice, no purpose, and you never saw them move, only saw them in different places.

Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone turned the Angels from a very creepy and very mysterious foe, into a joke... at least for me. I felt like the changes made to the Angels was an insult to Blink.

Had they used any other enemy for that episode, I think it would have been more enjoyable.  It's the fact that they took the Angels, a creative and unique enemy to face, and turned it basically into a slasher style movie. What's the point of using the Angels if no one is getting sent back in time by them? That is their thing, it's what made them so strange, and it made for an episode with an interesting and weaving plot that Moffat is spectacular at writing. Using the Angels for just some monster that kills people seems like a waste. It just came off as Moffat wanting to people excited by using the Angels, but not using them in the creative way he introduced them. It felt cheap and rushed to me.

I think everyone was looking forward to seeing the Doctor actually face the Angels in person (and not just through Sally Sparrow) but he faced a completely different breed of Angels than what we had seen before, and that left me (and probably a lot of others) feeling very let down and disappointed. 

I also felt annoyed that we actually got to see the Angels moving. I know they said these Angels were low on energy so they were slower, but it just felt like a cheap excuse to have a scene where we see them move.  What made them extra scary (at least for me) was that they were fast enough to never be seen moving. Again, it just felt cheap and left me with a bitter taste towards that episode.

But then again, I mean the guys paid National Insurance all his working life, so the state does owe him something. He shouldn't have to live off his wifes earnings. I do feel bad for him.

Edit: Great comment on the Guardian page there: &gt;This government increased national insurance payments

We pay 12% of qualifying income in NI every single week 52 weeks a year

Our employers pays a further 13.8% of qualifying income in NI every single week 52 weeks a year


The government is very keen to say how much benefits cost - but how much national insurance contributions do the nation pay annually to the government

What is 25.8% earnings for the whole nation ? How much does the government gather from us and our employers?

Hundreds of Billions of pounds paid in National Insurance contributions every single year - and yet like PPI policies - when it is time for the government to cough up - after someone has paid for 40 years - they government uses its power to deny the insurance policy benefits!

No doubt the government consulted bankers to ask - how did you ensure your PPI policies did not pay out as we would like to copy your model - get the insurance money every week but don't actually pay out on the policy

Just keep reducing the benefits on an insurance policy which increases every single year

25.8% of national earnings every week and this government is denying Insurance Policy Benefits

true,thebuggalo,null,null,"Since a few of the ones I would pick haven't been listed yet, I'll throw mine in the pot.

**Ninth Doctor**

Dalek - What else can be said about this one? Eccleston was brilliant. For the first time in the new series we saw the Doctor afraid. It was the first truly dark episode of New Who, and excellently showed how desperate the Doctor was to kill the last Dalek.

The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances - Again, another classic that will be on every's favorite list. Just the line, ""Everybody Lives, Rose! Just This Once, Everybody Lives!"" Great acting from Eccleston again, you can really sense his joy of saving all of those people.

Bad Wolf/Parting of the Ways - Although extremely dated and cheesy due to the Weakest Link and Big Brother style game shows, it still had a lot of great moments.  From when the Doctor got ""expelled"" from the house and staring down the cameras in the chamber, to saying ""no"" to the Dalek's, to Eccleston's last line of, ""You were fantastic, and you know what... so was I!"" He made his exit with the same smile he always greeted danger with. Just a perfect way for him to go.

The End of the World - I think a lot of people might not have liked this episode, but since I started my Who experience with the New Series, this was my first episode that took place in a different time, and what a way to start, by going to the end of earth. I liked how Jabe (the tree woman) hinted at who the Doctor was, giving us our first taste of the Doctor's past.

Fathers Day - Another hit or miss episode for some. It felt apart in some places for me, but the acting between Rose and her Father was very sweet, and I especially liked seeing Rose run after her Father the second time around and seeing her and Doctor from before disappear.


**Tenth Doctor**

Midnight - My favorite episode of the entire series. It felt like a classic Twilight Zone episode, it used so little to tell such a terrifying story. The acting was amazing, and the concept was so clever, and it just left such a big impact on me after watching. After all of that, the Doctor still knew nothing about what it was, and it clearly affected him.  When Donna repeated what he said at the end (""Molto Bene"") and he just replies, ""No, don't do that. Don't.... Don't"" You can see the terror and fear on him. It's unsettling to see the Doctor so terrified.

The Girl in the Fireplace - Another classic favorite. The end kills me every time. I've heard rumors that they are bringing her back, but I'd prefer they leave it. It was a tragic ending, but it has to end that way. The fact that the Doctor doesn't get to see her again makes the story so much more emotional, to know 5 seasons later that he actually does get to see her again would take away a lot from that episode.

The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit - I haven't seen much love for this episode, but it's always one I mention as a favorite of mine. I loved the line the Doctor says, right before dropping, ""If you talk to Rose - just tell her... tell her... oh, she knows."" 

Blink - A great story with a unique monster and fabulous way of using time travel. One of the first times that we are really introduced to the idea of events happening to the Doctor out of order (Sally knowing who he is before he knows who she is).

Gridlock - Some call it cheesy, and I would agree, but there was still something about this episode that got me. I can't really put my finger on it, but I know that I really like it.

**Eleventh Doctor**

Vincent and the Doctor - The first episode of Eleven's run that I actually really enjoyed. It actually brought a tear to my eye as well. I really have to give it up to Tony Curran who played Vincent. He was just fantastic.

Space/Time - I dunno if this is allowed, but the Comic Relief episodes Space/Time (which are 3 minutes each) was a very quick but very fun adventure. The concept was interesting and it played with time in a fun way, which Moffat seems to have a great sense for writing.

The Doctor's Wife - At the start of this episode, I was expecting to be disappointed, I thought personifying the Tardis was going to be a big mistake and fail miserably, but I was happily proven wrong. Idris was great, and it was excellent to see the old control room of 9 and 10 again, though it was a bit insulting to have it deleted from the Tardis. I believe the 9/10 control room is so much more beautiful and realistic than 11's.

A Good Man Goes to War - This episode started with a big (literally) and really never let up that much. The reveal of River being Amy's daughter had been ruined for me due to too much lurking on r/doctorwho but I felt the episode played out very well.  I especially loved the Doctor's speech to Colonel Runaway. It was the first time we've seen Eleven truly get angry, like almost lose control angry, and it really impressed me. Unfortunately, the second part of that story, Let's Kill Hitler, was a real low point in the season for me, and I found it very unlikable.

Closing Time - I originally was not a fan of The Lodger, but seeing the Doctor return to visit Craig turned out to be very fun. The episode made it clear that it wasn't going to take itself too seriously, and I accepted that and enjoyed it. The way the Doctor says hello to Craig at the beginning was perfect and I really enjoyed the dynamic between them.",0,1335819874,null,0,false,0,c4ignq6,t3_szb8c,t1_c4ignq6,t3_szb8c,null,1428828578,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Imagine that tip of an iceberg sinking below the waterline, only to bob up again later miles away; to someone who could only see above the water, it would look like teleportation!

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"The hardest job in football is to realise when your team is no longer capable of winning everything you want, and to refresh and make the changes needed. At it's most complete it involves the rebuilding of a new team and a new core of players who can be relied upon week in, week out. This is why you have to respect the jobs Ferguson and Wenger have done, Moyes too although less famously. They've taken apart teams they built themselves and kept the ship running on course

Now, AVB made a complete balls-up of the squad refreshment. Di Matteo came in with a simple goal; to win every game he could using the players he had. To this end, he told them everything they needed to hear and he's got the best out of them. This won't fly during the Summer, when some tough choices need to be made and necessary changes will take place. On one hand, he clearly has more respect from the players than AVB did, but on the other is RDM an attractive manager for potential targets? Players, especially youngsters, place a high priority on working with managers who they've admired for some time, people like Fergie, Wenger, Mourinho, Pep, etc. Di Matteo, for all the good he's done, is still a guy who got the job because nobody else was available. That is harsh and I don't agree with the view, but it is a pretty common opinion on his situation

I think he should get the job unless one of the 'Dream Candidates' becomes viable. Should we be able to sign Mourinho, Pep, or another manager of their calibre, it would be foolish not to take the chance. I can't accept RDM being fired only to be replaced by another 'flavour of the month' boss who's had 1 or 2 good seasons somewhere, but has no experience with signing big money/name players and getting them to gel. RDM has the backing of the squad and has the cache at the club to make his voice heard, I think it would be easier for him to do this than most other managers",0,1335827891,null,0,false,0,c4iidsf,t3_szqk7,t1_c4iidsf,t3_szqk7,null,1435718197,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

Tweed jackets are a bit of an outdated fashion statement, so the first place I suggest you look is at local Goodwills or other such stores. With any luck, you'll come across a nice jacket that'll suit you just fine and at an affordable price too! (But I'm assuming you'd be alright in wearing a men's jacket for such an occasion. Don't rightly know where one would find tweed for women).

But let's assume that you don't come across one, the next stop I suggest to you is to check out eBay and other such sites for secondhand or used tweed jackets. Since you're obviously looking to plan ahead (Halloween, last I checked, was quite a while off) you should be fine in patiently hunting for a good bargain.

After that all you need are a typical pair of brown or blue slacks and a cool red or blue bow tie (both very easily acquired at most fashion outlets or department stores).

Suspenders are a must, and after that we move onto tiny details:

A [sonic screwdriver](http://www.halloweencostumes.com/doctor-who-11th-doctor-sonic-screwdriver.html?source=googleps&amp;gclid=CJWKoMHg3a8CFYmR7Qod534LBg) is a must, and you'll want a gold wristwatch (worn with the face in the inside of your wrist, as the Doctor does.
