You're right, he doesn't do that anymore - and he's definitely not the player he was at his peak. But does that mean he's no longer a good enough player? 

All I'd say is that Gerrard is being utilised wrongly by Rodgers - as his career comes to an end he should be pushed forward, not deeper. Being deeper requires him to do more defensive work, which he doesn't seem fit or disciplined enough to be doing on a weekly basis, and it also increases the risk attached to some of his passing.

A lot of people have said he hasn't had a good performance this season - I'd rephrase it as he hasn't had a *memorable* performance. People are looking for vintage Gerrard, which we're unlikely to ever get again. He's had good performances this season, but they've largely been  understated, cog-in-the-machine type performances.

If the Queen lives as long as her mother then it could be another 15 years, making Charles nearly 80 by the time he's King.  William and Kate, as well as Harry, would be in their early to mid 40s... I don't know what plans are in place to change the succession rules such that first born daughters can become Monarch as I think it's currently the first born son meaning that if William and Kate have a daughter first then a younger son then the son becomes King... total bullshit which is why they're looking at changing it.  It has even been rumoured that the Queen would rather Anne succeeded her than Charles, but protocol doesn't allow it.

Elizabeth II is kind of an anomaly, because she really shouldn't have become Queen yet by sheer chance is well on her way to becoming one of the longest serving rulers in world history.  I am also certain she'll make it through the next four years and become the longest serving British monarch ever given, but will Philip be there to see in the occasion with her?  I'm not so sure, I think his health will fall off a cliff in the next couple of years and that'll be that, as bad as that sounds.

The only reason George VI became King at all was because Edward VIII had no children of his own; if he had, then we would never have had George VI or Elizabeth II.

As much as I value the work done by Mikel and Ramires there passing lets them down sometimes especially on the transition

I see mixed reviews on Torres in the thread a lot is improved performance and energy and others seem to have given up on him and unless he scored 5 goals every match the next 20 matches won't be happy which I can understand

However I have been adamant that the often idolized attacking trio of Mazacar has not been in full flight for at least parts of torres' decline this season and it was evident tonight.

Hazard has lost that spark from early season, early season I guess its unreasonable to expect him to win a penalty every game but he looked like he would and would win  numerous free kicks and have excellent overall play its gone missing

Things we need:
Cover for the Pivot(check)
Midfield Enforcer to protect the little guys (check)
Plan B (check)
Target man for goal kicks etc. (check)
Flexible Players who can fit in multiple systems or play multiple positions (check)

I think he would provide the ultimate flexibility in the midfield and options.  I think his offensive versatility combined with Oscar's versatility would be an increadible option up the middle.  Not only would they band of 3 be able to interchange positions but I can see games where Fellani and Oscar float back and forth between which one is in the pivot at any given time.  Our little hobbits also need someone who is willing to be physical and protect them.  Right now there is no reprocussion for teams hacking at mazacar everytime they touch the ball.  Do you think Man City would be so physical if everytime Silva touched the ball he got laid out by Fellani?  When teams park the bus at us Fellani floats up to playing behind the striker while Oscar drops into the pivot to orcastrate the attack.  Oscar can still pop up for his long range shots he loves and all of a sudden we have a bonified target man in the middle for the crosses.

Are we being pressed high up the field and having trouble releiving pressure?  Turn Fellani into the target man on long balls for Cech and we don't need a striker who can hold up play as much.  Early in the season they were aiming for Ivanovich up field on the wing with our goal kicks, this would allow the full backs to be in a little better position.

Overall I just think his versatility would be an increadible fit with the current Chelsea line up and would add some much needed size and physicality to the current Chelsea line up.  He could be paired with any of our current pivot players or moved up behind the striker for cover as well.

Other strikers can at least bring other factors into play, so that's why people want another striker.

Over here in Malaysia, finding another hardcore Chelsea fan is hard business. I can only imagine how amazing it would be to actually be a ST holder, watching the team every week. 

Personally, I'd probably be doing the same as these fans, holding up signs saying Rafa Out or In RDM we trust. Everybody loved him as a player..one of the finest to grace the SB pitch week in week out and wear our kit. He comes back as a manager and wins us the Champions League as well. 

None of us and I repeat NONE of us liked Rafa when he was Liverpool manager after his comments about us. And most still don't like him. Riling up opposition is one thing...commenting about their fans and support is just stupid. Even when Mourinho did it to some of his own Madrid fans...it was a pretty stupid move.

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"Its seriously sketchy and detrimental to pretty much all citizens.  But governments do it anyway

There's plenty of theory on why governments do it.  The leading guy is probably Foucault - if you're interested, read a summary (or god forbid the full text) of *Society Must be Defended* or *Security, Territory, Population*.  Ulrich Beck's *Risk Society* is perhaps the best contemporary overview.   Agamben also has a lot to say on the subject.  For a brief intro to the discourse, [this wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopower) will serve as well as any.

Governments - and the British government in particular - are looking for any excuse to justify and legitimise the extension of their powers.  This is just one component of a broader trend.  Derogating from the Human Rights Act so they could increase detention without charge was a more overtly authoritarian example of this.

The whole trend is hugely disturbing, and the only real solution is an active and engaged populace and media.  Unfortunately, we seem to be heading in the opposite direction.

Edit: another key aspect is the portrayal of some risks as much less desirable than other risks. The fear of terrorism is used to justify such absurd measures because governments have successfully painted it as more scary, and somehow more threatening to society, than other equivalent threats. If the amount of money invested in surveillance, security or wars was invested in health care or on the beat police, far more lives would be saved.

But governments have convinced their population that a certain level of crime and preventable death from disease is acceptable - whereas even one death at the hands of a terrorist threatens the structure of society.

It's not the nature of the death either - the Blitz in London and the IRA years in Ireland were both modern times with a constant risk of violent death. But instead of discourses of fear and the need for government protection, there were discourses of solidarity and bravery. It's all very strange and concerning.",0,1353899046,null,0,1353932048,0,c76s26q,t3_13rm4i,t1_c76s26q,t1_c76qnpn,null,1430500293,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

true,willyleaks,null,null,"She's a socialite extremist. She is obsessed with how she is seen by her peers to the point of having clinical paranoia. Here she is going to extremes to prove the point that she isn't a racist. Or in this case, I suspect specifically that she felt that if she didn't act, she might be called a racist. Although it afflicts all genders and ages (commonly witnessed as people attempting to be heroes although that may have a number of other psychological causes), it is particularly common in women of this age. They really are dangerous.

She's not ""not racist"" because of any kind of personal conviction. It's about what she believes is socially acceptable and what presents an opportunity to be socially predatory and climb the ladder. That is, who devotes themselves the most to enforcing social ""rules"". It's almost a kind of vigilante justice and on the other hand being a sycophant. If you imagine such a person in a society turned upside down, where not being racist is socially unacceptable, I can assure you, she would be going out of her way to prove what a major racist she is. She wouldn't dare employ a black person, after all, what would people think? Ironically, she has actually demonstrated that she is in fact a potential racist. The opposite of what she no doubt intended. All it takes is the right crowd.

I feel sorry for her because she probably isn't really fully aware of why she is acting like this. There's a good opportunity here, this may well backfire on her, but someone needs to explain to her why it backfired and what primitive psychological processes drove her to to attempt this madness so that she can understand it, become more self aware and avoid it in the future. Unfortunately though, the thing that she is so terrified of - social stigma, ironically that drove her to this action in the first place, may have happened as a result of it. It may be very difficult to break her denial. Right now she's an animal. I would deem her sentient but not truly self aware. It's amazing how much someone can get by and perform complex tasks with no or limited self awareness. Actually self awareness isn't conducive to survival in humans, at least, not as much as social ability is.

What if we had a similar premier league ending position similar to last year now I know we were going good but our form had dipped. So what if at the end of the season RDM and Chelsea have a poor year and we go well atleast we treated RDM fairly, hes the manager, Chelsea in my opinion has to have the best man for the job and if RDM isn't that guy well that's life.

i don't really see how AVB has ""unlocked"" anything - defoe's problem has never been scoring, he scored plenty last year when 'arry brought him on late in games, and he scored every year that i can remember before that. 

the knock on him has generally been his wastefulness and lack of passing/hold-up play. which i think was the same today, and has been the same recently as it's always been. it's just less evident in a game like today's, where we have 25 total shots as a team and are really firing on all cylinders. i made a post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/zzdge/defoe_upfront/c695h06) after the reading game earlier this year (which was a very similar result) saying the same thing, and i stand by it still. 

with defoe, i really think at this point you know what you're going to get. he's 30, and he's not changing much as a player by now.

Torres was part of that team, he was even the one who tormented us the most. but he's here and have the fans full support while can Rafa have the same. and half of the comments were edited by the media at the time. and he did it to protect his team any manager would have done that. I remeber Mourinho would piss of the media to take attention from his players anytime something happen backstage.

You also said something about us getting rid of a club legend and the guy who helped us achieve our ultimate goal.

We did the same for Torres, we let our legend and champions league hero go to accomandate the man who tormented us when he played for liverpool

im not saying we should be buddy buddy about it, but at least give him the benefit of the doubt. and treat him with respect because he's our coach. you dont have to like the guy but at least respect him. the Rafa signs was a bit harsh and childish. if they were that mad why not take the problem out on Roman instead of his messsnger.

Additionally, art philosophy about process vs. final product is incredibly subjective. If people don't like this picture, then that's fine - but it's stupid to insult it just because something similar could be accomplished in photoshop. Because that's retarded. That's like insulting a perfectly photorealistic painting because a camera could have done it too.

as for rvp going to manu or torres going to chelsea. of course the receiving clubs are more positive about it. for a start, getting rvp/torres weakens your opponent. while theoretically strengthening your own club. a lot of chelsea fans saw rafa as weaken liverpool with his tactics. and they are now not sure he strengthens the team. its a completely different situation.

also, i think its really harsh on the fans this whole situation. we're damned if we do, damned if we dont. roman is a double edged sword. he's given us the most success we've ever had. but we've also generated a shit load of animosity towards us. so what are we supposed to do when we see things that we feel hurts the team and the club? the ones that end up having to deal with the fall out are the fans. 

you support the fans first, then the manager. imo. if the fans are pissed off, you have their back. they have a right to be heard. its not like roman is letting people watch the games for free. if he doesnt care about the fans opinion, why doesnt he just play the games in empty stadiums.

ive been a fan long before roman came and ill be a fan long after roman goes. i know whos side i'm on. even though i personally wouldnt boo.",0,1353912131,null,0,false,0,c76v84t,t3_13rvof,t1_c76v84t,t1_c76u3gz,null,1430501794,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

I'm pretty sure he was meant as one of the two in Bren's 1-2 formation (Allen-Hendo/Gerrard) but mostly in the first half yesterday this meant standing in the centre circle waiting for Joe or Jordan to win the ball, and then giving it away again.

His best seasons for liverpool have been when the team has been built around his strengths and made sure he didn't need to do too much work off the ball.
The Houllier team where he played CM but had 3 workers in Riise, Hammann and Murphy alongside him
The early Rafa team where he played right midfield with license to move inside, while Alonso and Sissoko locked down central midfield.
The late Rafa team where he played off Torres with Alonso, Mascherano and or Lucas behind.

Now he has to find a role where the team isn't built around him but where his talent can be most useful. I'd really like that to be on the right side of the attacking three.

Most Doctors have either regenerated in front of their companions, or while unconscious.

All allodial titles currently belong to the crown and the norm would be a transferral of these titles to the state.

The status of the crown estate is not remotely straight forward. It isn't property as you and I understand the term. It does not fit in with the legal structures the UK normally uses for property.

Of course since parliament appoints the monarch via precedents set during the Glorious Revolution it is easy to work around the problem in all cases. The land doesn't belong to the Windsor family even if it does belong to the monarchy. We could just put a republican as king and have him transfer the titles.

I think when you're a fan that's dedicated to a TV show, you would honestly love it if it never ended. At first. However, most shows become stale after 5 or 6 seasons and people lose interest.

Change in a TV show is a good thing if it becomes a staple of the show itself.

I live in Hawaii (technically America, but ask anyone here and most feel we're being indefinitely occupied by the US). But no matter, I am thus an American citizen.

It's not the glamor, or ""fashionable Londoners"" I am interested in.

It started out, for me, reading the classics, certain British movies and television shows, etc, but then I became really interested in the history. My mother's side is from England, with my grandmother's brother being an RAF pilot involved in the Dover events. He died there. But still, no matter.

It's hard to explain this, but for me, it's really like looking into my own history. After all, the first real settlers in American were from Britain, the English language is well, *English*. In a sense, doesn't American history intrinsically involve English history? A subtler factor is my personality, which I will not claim to be ""British"", however, for an American, I express myself in a more understated manner and do not wish to display my emotions and passions at every turn, which apparently, is ""British"". When I watch a British show, movie, or converse with my British friends, I feel more at home with it. And yes, I do irony.

I am currently studying UK history, which I should've done long ago as my mother's side came from there. But I will not fragrantly be fan-ish, or ""zomg i luvvz yur accent, like, omg!"" Although I'll admit, my grandmother says, when I speak so, my accent sounds ""like the Queen's English, spot-on!""

I am only coming to realise that my interest here isn't a passing thing, but something I feel as part of my own history. And I certainly don't want to be embarrassing or ingratiating, either. I take it seriously and I don't want to follow American misconceptions or erroneous stereotypes about the British, I want to know the real Britain. I don't care to be a romanticist.

Ironically the issues with the submarines are the best example of the problem; remember that the last series of subs we built were designed in the 80's. There's been a big skill gap that's had to be rebuilt, and the Astute is the first of the subs built from that new knowledge base. We're only now seeing the results of this. This is also the reason why BAE is trying to continue with the 'successor' class (Trident) despite the political impasse over its future; if you don't utilise these designers you loose them.

In the surface ship fleet there were obviously big problems setting a program up to build the Type 45's, but then all that design knowledge and technical skill was pulled through into the CVF program, and is also now being pulled across into the Type 26 program.

The main concern people initially had with this was that it was essentially free money for supermarkets. It's a massive windfall. And so, going hand in hand with this windfall, is a **windfall tax**.

In Scotland, at least, the entirety of the windfall gained by shops selling alcohol is taxed by the government, with a certain percentage (possibly as high as 100%, can't remember) being set aside for social programs to deal with alcohol abuse.

It's an extremely easily levied tax that can be used almost entirely to combat the problem it seeks to solve. This is tax engineering at its finest and is one of the few things the tory government is doing right IMO.

I'd disagree about the decreased attention span being the main cause, although it is relevant. For anyone going back to watching a TV show after a number of years ""clean"" I can tell you it is an obnoxious experience. Shots a cut at random between about 1 and 3 seconds in the worst cases, even the ""science"" channels do this with lots of swoops, flashing colours, obnoxious sounds, and even when there is content its not allowed to be dwelt on before the next issue is thrown at you in an endless changing of the subject. Many times some show like ""Celebrity"" will have 5 minutes of content about content yet to come, the focus is what's ""coming up next"". News in a way typifies this with random ""live"" shots, very short interviews swapping to and fro between talking heads, there's often a ticking clock, some kind scrolling banner text (again the ""coming up next"" strategy).

The real problem is the design of the school curriculum, and pointless electoral system that reduces politics down to picking a nice face or favourite colour. The other issue is any complex subject is difficult to get a handle on and modern society just does allow the time, grounding or participation.

It can be rather depressing listening to what the general public think about complex issues, especially economics. Particularly when people come out with such bold claims such as 'immigrants are stealing jobs', 'we need more housing benefit' or 'fuel duty is far too high'. But this is not unexpected given the lack of education in economics.

What almost all people do not understand is that economics, particularly macroeconomics is complicated. Really complicated. As in, you can be really smart and do a PhD in economics and you still are only right maybe 75% of the time on the big decisions. At best. 

Sadly, the government is also hilariously ignorant of basic economic principles. This is where serious problems develop, due to having successive chancellors with no degree or work experience in economics at all. This naturally leads to them consistently making schoolboy errors that professional economists and even reasonably sharp economics graduates would avoid. Like losing several billion to speculators on Black Wednesday, selling gold at the bottom of the market, deregulating the financial sector and PFI schemes. And they say, it was unforeseeable.

    Hiring relatives - yep, in a flash

To put this into a simple context for you there are 498,433 civil servants in this country, including MPs, department office workers, doctors, nurses, firemen, the armed services and the police. When they sign a contract with HMG they are all signing the The Civil Service Code of conduct. Forging expenses, not going through the correct hiring procedure and even something like claiming an extra train ticket for your wife/husband/partner/mistress goes against this code and is an instant dismissal.  If these stunts had been pulled by anyone who was not an MP then they would have been fired without question, even if it was something small like a nurse claimed for a extra bus ticket. 

The code: http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/about/values

http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/civil-service-conduct-and-guidance

""The Civil Service Code sets out the framework within which all civil servants work, and the core values and standards of behaviour they are expected to uphold. It forms part of the terms and conditions of employment of every civil servant.""

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"Its the wrong way to solve the problem. The reason poor people drink is because life is fucking boring when you haven't got much money. You can't afford to piss off somewhere nice at the weekend but you can, just about, afford to get pissed or high. I think this is a collective problem, we don't provide ourselves with an enthusiastic attitude towards life; drinking/drug culture is almost an exception to this rule - people get really excited about going out and getting trashed, having a house party or whatever.

Some ideas to cure our society of boredom: 

* increase take home wages for ""at risk"" groups so people can do more (fat chance of this happening), in the short term people would just buy more beer anyway.

* Start up events schemes interesting in capturing the imagination and excitement *of someone between the ages of 18 and 35 without kids*. Everything is ""an evening of festive family fun"" so you're surrounded by fair grounds and children; if you're not a parent this is fucking dull. Ok, fireworks are cool but there is pretty much always a beer tent around so this is nullified.

* Sporting events that are accessible to adults need to get more face time to the ""at risk of boredom"" groups. You don't have to be a kid to take up a sport, this should be cheap fun and really easy to do.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The argument is predicated on the idea that all meat is produced or acquired in the same fashion, which brings it screeching to a halt almost immediately. Some animals are battery-farmed, some are given organic feed, some are pastured, some are shot in the wild after living long and healthy lives, some are raised on huge, expansive preserves. Equating all ""meat-eating"" with fox-hunting is wilfully blinkered and inherently flawed, from an ethical standpoint. 

It's absolutely true that some poor sows are kept confined in cages too restrictive for them to lie down in. But all that does is give you a means of objecting by purchasing meat raised ethically. Picking up a bit of venison that's been humanely stalked and hung the week before because otherwise it would slowly and agonisingly starve to death in the cold November drizzle isn't anywhere near the same _universe_ as dressing up like an anachronistic twatleak and poncing about following animals bred specifically to harry and terrify and tear apart one specific species for an afternoon's entertainment.

There's also the argument that due to centuries of animals being selectively-bred to yield the highest profits, if we were to all suddenly switch to a vegetarian diet there are about two species of highland cow that would survive in the wild. Many of the animals we now eat simply would not be viable, and it would take many more centuries of careful babysitting to undo the direction we've forced them in. It's a nice idea but ultimately idealistic, especially due to the plethora of other products besides meat that we rely upon animals for. They would continue to be farmed and killed anyway for those derivatives, so all we'd be doing is chucking their muscle tissue in the bin rather than eating it. But that's a whole other can of worms to open and I'd rather focus on these pricks using their wealth and influence to skirt the law for the sake of a ""tradition"" that got banned for the same reasons as badger-baiting, cock-fighting and child labour.

""But for the small amount of fudging which was seen as a way of topping up a salary which did not match the job then I side with the MPs.""

It does match the job when you factor in all the opportunities that are opened up to them through it. They knew how much they would be paid when they signed up and they also know full well that if it isn't enough then they can leave after 4 years and walk into any high paying job that they want. It's greed, pure and simple, you may have done the same thing but that does not make it right.  

My dad has two oxbridge degrees in economics and turned down a high paying job in the city to work for the civil service when he graduated, he accepted lesser pay for long term security and a chance to make a difference. I suspect if you asked every department employee ""job security"" would be the main reason they all joined as well.  Edit: All the Civil service asks of them is that they don't steal stuff, it's actually very important from a political stand point because stuff like expenses get  added into the sum total of civil service expenditure which is given to the press.  There is also the fact that if 498,433 people are all allowed to get away with claiming an extra bus ticket then that's £847,336 out of the public purse. 

 NHS doctors get paid far less than if they worked privately, should they be allowed to take home x-ray machines to compensate? An average Army Sargent gets paid far less than if he were working for a private security firm in Afghanistan, is he allowed to take some guns to make up the difference?

They signed a legally binding contract and broke it, under the terms that they signed to they should have been fired.

There was a little bit of word play regarding remote and the same goes for tele- (from the greek meaning distance), but OP is implying there is a better sort of newspaper that one should be viewing. Even if that was case (and I don't believe it is), the paradigm of the consumer and producer still exists, where the producer is definitely a filter herding public opinion, yes, even the Guardian, yes, especially the BBC.

For me the problem isn't good sources of information but that people from a young age starting in school are taught to obey authority, hate learning, conform visually and tribally, but most significantly are ostracised from the day to day running of their own lives which continues until death. You don't control when you speak, who you speak to, where you are, when you eat, what you dress in. Parents don't even have a say in something as fundamental as what is taught in school.

""A man is alive who wasn't before"", alone, is no different from anyone else the Doctor saves.

true,HarryBlessKnapp,eng-GreaterLondon,South Weezey Mandem,"&gt;It's downright awful for fresh fruit and veg

How do you mean? Price or quality wise? This worries me. The thing is I'd like to go to a local farmers market, but I don't drive, and where I am in Liverpool, the market is in a different place every bloody week. It's really annoying. The only veg I really buy is potatoes, tomatoes, onions and occasionally courgettes. The potatoes are very cheap and okay, the onions are reasonable. The courgettes are a bit shoddy. However, the tomatoes, whilst not great quality wise, actually refuse to go off. I know that's not necessarily a good thing, but when you shop on a shoe string like us it really helps.

Also, Asda's trump card - Manda African Chilli sauce in the world foods section. Powerful stuff. Best widely available chilli sauce I've ever tasted.

*Lots of rain watering lush green vegetation and rolling green hills

*very varied landscapes including volcanoes, forests etc. 

*earthquakes 

*terribly, prohibitively expensive to visit 

*All blacks and general obsession with rugby  

*Maori and their sea faring culture which associates New Zealand with other pacific islands 

*weird rivalry with Australia in a Henery Hawk versus Foghorn Leghorn style, in that Kiwis seem 
very concerned with it and Aussies barely seem to be aware of it 

*A North and South Island

*The possibility and rumours of cities or Towns other than Christchurch, Auckland and Wellington as hinted at by New Zealand ex pats

*The possibility, evidenced by a film industry and farming that not all New Zealanders are bartenders in their native land and they can be trained for other uses.

*Wildlife wise a haven for rare and unique bird and bat species 

*Anzac contribution in WWII 

*Quite racist a few decades ago (white only immigration policy etc) but a lot better now with the younger generations, part of general world globalisation etc

*May or may not be the true home of the pavlova

I know what you're saying, and mostly I agree with you.  The word 'faggot', when used as an insult, is inherently linked with homophobia, so it's pretty much always bad to use it, because you're reinforcing the notion that being gay is something that it's acceptable to equate with being bad.

But sometimes people are simply wrong to take offence.  If I tell somebody they are ignorant, and they think I'm calling them stupid, it's not my fault that they're offended.  They misunderstood what the word meant, and I don't think it's incumbent on me to apologise because of their *completely imagined* offence.

In my head, I didn't expect major alterations either. I'm not really expecting a Cavani-like signing. But it's painfully clear that we struggle to score goals. We need *at least* one experienced player who is more than capable of supporting Suarez and scoring goals.

That player along with the return of Lucas could result in Gerrard being pushed forward. And let's not forget Borini either, he still needs a chance to prove himself (and I think he should).

Major alterations? No. But I fully expect our most glaring issue to be addressed.

I've been learning Welsh since I was about 4 or 5, all the way to my GCSEs. In infants and primary we also had to ask to go to the toilet in Welsh or we weren't allowed to go and a moment that sticks in my memories is when one boy pooed himself in year 2 because he couldn't remember the phrase...

Today, I know how to say a few phrases or words but the rest has just gone. It isn't used at all in this area and I know I can travel across most of Wales and still be fine speaking English. 

There is still a pride in being Welsh but the language has little to do with it - of the ~350 pupils who sat Welsh GCSE only about 15 took it at A level when the choice was given to us. It really is a false revival in many places especially on the border like us.

In my opinion, unless more than 50% of the population are only Welsh speakers, there shouldn't be a discrimination against people who don't speak the language. The writer makes a fair point that bringing up children to only speak one language that such a small amount of people speak is going to give them a disadvantage for their future if they leave Wales. And it is true that children will be told off in Welsh speaking schools for speaking English even outside of the classroom - the school around the corner from me was a Welsh school for a year or so, a few locals worked there as dinner ladies/playground assistants. They were expected to speak only Welsh to the children and if any kid was 'caught' speaking English they were to be taken to a teacher to be scolded. A girl who moved to our English school for 6th form said she thought primarily in Welsh after having the same experience and so there were frequently problems in lessons such as sciences and maths where some new concepts just baffled her - she was translating words she didn't know or understand...

Then you said:

&gt; This pricing won't do a thing to pubs and clubs as their prices are already far higher than the minimum being set

So in other words, minimum pricing will likely have no impact on pub sales because the pricing isn't high enough to counteract pub pricing (which would essentially mean the supermarkets subsidising pub pricing.

It's not clear how you think it will help pubs given the points you've made. If it's cheaper to continue an existing entrenched behaviour, why change?

The true problem with our game just now is that it is utterly predictable and seems to rely too much in personal ability, e.g. ""Silva will make that pass through opposition defence line and Agüero will score 1vs1 with goalkeeper"", and the problem with that is that it seems to work less and less when time goes on. It begins to seem like that there aren't even any particular plan how we should create goals, like for example how United tries to play wide and cross to box. Also, we practically don't even use counter-attacks that actually can be (again my opinion!) one of most dangerous situations in game and our players certainly has the potential for really intelligent decisions but it seems like it's now totally muted since our game is so slow. Good example for this is Maicon who plays totally differently that other city players. In game against RM, Maicon created a lot of chances by just being direct with ball. One wall pass with Silva, run forward, goal scoring opportunity created. We basically can't do shit if we just try to maintain 100% ball posession and create 0 chances, It's not the style how you can actually win in football (since our team isn't in fact Barcelona). I wait for every game in hope of Mancini showing something new or different how we could turn our form to better, but so far basically nothing has changed. However, these are only my opinions and by all means feel free to disagree.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"Since Chels-Guevara started, I'll take up the baton. Essentially, we came in and threw away the traditional rulebook. Roman was the first owner to splash the cash on such a monumental scale, even adjusted for the time Jack Walker didn't spend nearly as much on Blackburn and he's seen as the first lavish owner in the Premiership. Traditional success was built on domestic honours leading to a larger fanbase, more income and in turn better players to challenge the European elite. We had a cosmopolitan squad even in the 90s so had an eclectic band of fans, but we weren't on the same level as United and Liverpool

Traditional success was also based on a manager coming in, nurturing the younger players through the ranks and trying to promote from within whenever possible, aided by players who moved far less often. As a comparison, how many 'One Club Men' do you know of? Back in the day it was relatively commonplace. The inherent managerial and playing staff stability along with a lack of lavish investment led to something of a status quo. The big boys never fell too far off the pace but with the exception of Blackburn, were never threatened from below. We came in and tore down the Premiership duopoly, in some style might I add. Instantly becoming the most disliked team in the country. However, the pace of transition at Chelsea has the side effect of making the manager's job a short-term affair, the bar of success has been set so high that it's difficult to continuously attain. It's that pursuit of perfection which has helped Abramovich go from nothing to ogligarch in 25 years, he won't settle for less in his personal life either

Football is an unscientific business, nobody can say for sure whether we'd have won more or less if Jose had remained in charge for more years or if Ancelotti had been given more time. What I would contend is that we are almost identical in terms of success with United since Roman came in and that is as good as you could hope for back when Roman took over. I won't criticise what he chooses to do because the club owes him everything, have to accept the ridiculous with the sublime. Also, let's not lump Avram Grant, Guus Hiddink and Benitez in with the proper hirings of Mourinho, Scolari, Ancelotti, AVB and RDM (albeit belatedly and forced due to PR). We've had 5 real managers since Roman came in which isn't great but by my count Real Madrid have had between 8-10, Barcelona have had 3, Inter have had 7, Bayern have had 5 or 6, AC Milan have had 3, Liverpool have had 5. I picked those teams as a representation of Europe's footballing elite (and 1 team who somehow won the CL) to show that we're not far and away the most trigger happy team out there, it's just that many commentators compare us exclusively to United and Arsenal, which are 1 man dynasties. I don't see anything but anecdotal evidence to suggest having 1 manager in charge for 15 years is better than 5 managers who each had 3 years, in fact you could argue that after a certain amount of time the manager becomes stale and either he or the players need to be refreshed to keep the team competitive.

That is what remembrance day is about, RESPECT. That has never changed and nor will it.
I think all this talk about the 'bling' poppies being to commercial is ridiculous. At the end of the day all the British Legion are doing is reaching out to a newer, more broad audience in order to help increase their funds. How can we criticise them when they are raising money to help OUR men and women!!
At the end of the day wearing a poppy IS important and it shouldn't matter if it plastic or crystal because the symbolism is still there.
Our soldiers don't care what poppy you wear or if you don't wear one at all. Its the support it shows them they are not alone.

Fair enough, but you have to understand how dismissive and inflammatory a remark like ""Also, pretty much anyone who eats meat should probably shut up too"" might appear, and how it would suggest a certain mindset many are very tired of.

&gt;The issue people seem to have is with the unnecessary cruelty of the death. 

That's absolutely it. If they really do warrant hunting to this degree (to the point where you breed, buy and raise horses costing in the thousands, as well as housing a pack of hounds) then you could very cost-effectively acquire an FAC, a .223 or .243 rifle and dispatch of the ""pest"" immediately and humanely. My objection - as someone who is both a firearms enthusiast and keen advocate of people taking responsibility for the production of their food by involving themselves in the hunting and preparation of their meat - is that these people are holding this up as a shield in an entirely disingenuous fashion. It is humane and barbaric and you will be hard-pressed to visit any subreddit like /r/guns or /r/firearms, where true hunters outnumber these red-jacketed cunts one hundred to one, and see anyone advocating any method of dispatching an animal like this in any way that isn't as humane as possible. Part of indulging in such an activity is taking responsibility for avoiding the suffering of the animal, and as annoying as those subs get, even the most backwoods Alabama teenager is going to seethe with resentment for anyone who even jokes about plinking at an animal for enjoyment, or feel contempt for people who dedicate their free time to needlessly terrifying and causing suffering to another living being for their own perverse amusement.

However, your opening sentence highlights most peoples' key complaint - the austerity measures that are already in place aren't realistic, for a long-term recovery, nor are the proposed future plans.

No one can deny - for example, that our total ""Welfare"" bill, across all forms of benefits, is *waaay* too high. But the measures being introduced aren't working - they're merely adding additional cost to a series of systems that already cost a small fortune. 

Using private contractors to oversee medical tests on claimants, and other private companies to administer and deliver welfare to work programmes might look fine on paper, but both are being shown to be fraught with problems, and aren't delivering anything even beginning to approach good value for money.

true,phishsticker,lfc68,,"I disagree. Gerrard just seems lost in the current system. He rarely drives forward when hes in that AM position. Remember Suso coming on as a sub, driving forward from midfield to set up the goal vs our win against west brom or Jonjos goal at young boys where he picked up the ball in midfield to score a goal? When was the last time you saw Gerrard open up the defense like that, or even attempt something like that? THAT is exactly what the AM should be doing in the formation we play, which Gerrard no longer seems to be able to produce. 


Against Swansea he was supposed to be playing further up the pitch, with Allen and Henderson behind him, but we still were missing that link between midfield and attack. Nobody complains about Gerrard not shooting, I think it is the complete opposite. He rarely shoots nowadays. I can't even remember the last half decent shot on target from outside the box from Gerrard. When Jonjo came on for Henderson and Gerrard slotted back into a deeper role, we looked much more threatening.

When he sits deeper he does not track back like he needs to either, which is the biggest problem with him playing in that role. The most worrying part is that he just seems uninterested half the time. Lucas coming back and having to do the job of 2 midfielders does NOT solve this problem either, it just puts more pressure on Lucas, who has been out for months.  Most of his passing is good, though he has given the ball away in awful positions a few times and with his experience he should know better. 

I don't know if it is all mental, or if he is just past it. I think the fact that we have gone so far backwards these past couple years has really demoralized him. The fact that our team no longer gravitates around his ability probably does not do his confidence any good either. But if we want to push up the table we need to have every player doing their job well. He has been my favorite player for over a decade, but you can't be nostalgic if you wan't to move forward as a team.

true,Pergatory,k9,K-9,"There are a lot of internally-consistent easter eggs in the show.

For example there's a scene in The Impossible Astronaut (or the second part) where everyone is in the White House trying to figure out what to do. Amy has to go to the bathroom, where she encounters a member of the Silence. A woman comes out of the toilet and the Silence kills her. Amy says it didn't have to do that as the lady couldn't even remember it. Its response is ""Joy."" Amy asks for clarification, and the Silence says ""Her name was Joy. You are Amelia. You will tell the Doctor.""

Most people think nothing of this scene except the Silence trying to convince the Doctor he needs to go die at Lake Silencio, but I actually think there was a much more subtle element at play in that scene. Consider that the Silence, in most appearances, have a certain degree of foreknowledge; they come from the Doctor's future. An example is the one that shows up at Lake Silencio to watch the Doctor die; he knew he didn't need to do anything but watch from afar because he already knew how events should play out.

Similarly, I think the reason it killed Joy is because it had foreknowledge of killing Joy. That's why, when asked why it had killed her, it replied simply that her name was Joy. It knew it was responsible for killing someone named Joy in that encounter, and so it took the opportunity to do so. The lady's name may not have even been Joy, as long as that's how history remembers her. For a long time, I was hoping we'd get a scene where Amy berated the Silence for killing innocent Joy, only to later realize that this event was in the Silence's past, and thus she basically caused Joy's death by berating them for killing her before they had done so, and thus forcing them to kill her in their own future to maintain causality. Unfortunately that never happened, but it's still my pet theory as to what happened in that scene.

Another example is the Papal Mainframe. I think this is a big reveal that's yet to come: I believe the Papal Mainframe is River Song. Think about it, what do we know about River Song's ultimate fate? In her first ever episode, she dies, and her consciousness is uploaded into the mainframe of the Library at some point in the 50th century.

Fast-forward to the 51st century. This is where the Silence is doing battle against the Doctor. The Silence have an ally, the Order of the Headless Monks, who are apparently followers of a ""Papal Mainframe."" What do we know about the Order? For starters, while they appear to be enemies of the Doctor, every single appearance they've made has ultimately been to the Doctor's benefit. If they weren't present at Demon's Run, allowing the lowering of the hoods, the Doctor wouldn't have had his easy distraction, nor would he have had two sides to turn against each other. Their presence allowed his victory. Without their presence, Dorium may not have had his head conveniently stored away for the Doctor to interrogate later. Going further back, remember when the Doctor went to a museum with Amy and found the home box for the Byzantium starliner which led them to save River? The museum they were in was the Delirium Archive; the so-called ""final resting place of the Headless Monks."" So River herself ensured that the home box would find its way there with the message written by her past self.

Put all these pieces together, and I think it paints a pretty clear picture that River Song is headed for yet another big identity reveal. Will we ever finish finding out who she really is?",0,1353958323,null,0,false,0,c773ga2,t3_13thoe,t1_c773ga2,t3_13thoe,null,1430505742,29,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,29

Last season we had horrible form in January and hopefully, we've got the teething problems out of the way early in the season when we can actually afford to lose games.

With Champions League, I am obviously disappointed with our performances, but in Dortmund, we've had what looks like a contender for the cup itself so we can't feel too disheartened with a draw against them. We were unbeaten at home against Real Madrid, Ajax and Dortmund? Not bad.

We are the only undefeated team in the league, Silva hasn't quite looked himself yet this season, the best is to come from, same with Aguero, both suffered injuries which have hampered our goal scoring. The way I see, we've been in bad form and we're still undefeated in the league.

It remains to be seen what impact Yaya going off to the ACN will have on the squad, I fear we will lose a bit of grit in the midfield, but I think playing without him might be good for us, we do rely on him a bit much. Signings this season haven't looked too bad, Javi Garcia is just a better looking, less adapted Gareth Barry and Nastasic looks a gem, Sinclair is young and Rodwell might be a decent centre half, but he's looked disappointing so far.

All in all, it's a good time to be a City fan, I trust Mancini and think he's the best man for the job.

true,lawschoolzombie,null,null,"Wait, what do you mean use your players better? Communicating and motivating is GREAT if you actually know what to communicate. This does not mean RDM didn't know any tactics or strategy, but Rafa is clearly the better tactical man. So far as team morale is concerned, I think when you stop losing that kind of helps the team morale. 

One of the saddest things under RDM was, they looked great going forward in patches (note in patches part), but **n.e.v.e.r.** looked remotely convincing as a defensive unit. Even the (cowers in fear) UCL win was a fluke in defensive tactics. Basically at no point of time did it look like we would win, which is great to bluff your way through to a UCL/FA Cup win, but stops working surprisingly quickly when teams find better ways to break you down.

Against Juventus it was borderline depressing watching the team let through goals that a Jose/Carlo defense would never even have let through in their training sessions. 

I am a great fan of Robbbie, both as a player and as a manager. I think he did the best he could, but he's not a big team manager, he will grow, no doubt about it. But you know you were in a free fall when you realize that the Man City match was our first clean sheet in almost two months. 

Also, I've stuck with all managers since Ranieri (Ranieri included), and only disliked Scholari and AVB (AVB never/still does not look convincing as a top flight manager) and RDM was my joint favourite with Hiddink. But the fact of the matter is that I would happily invite him home for tea, but if I had sunk close to a billion in my club, I would find a more proven manager. And say what you will about Rafa, he's proven himself on multiple occasions - Valencia of 2001, Liverpool of 2005, 2009 all looked great teams all-in-all. I can only anticipate in wonder on how his beautiful tactics will melt the trio of our superb attacking midfielders together with our potentially world class defense. 

Rafa is capable of a great many things. and I'm very excited to see him stay and help us through this tough times. Remember, his title bid (especially the last few games) of 2008-09 was a phenomenal team that made used to regularly rape teams.

true,dwair,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"4x4 drivers - hmm... bit of an easy target maybe?  

Yes there are a few wankers out there who own 4x4 but how does that stack up against BMW or commercial van drivers when looking at bad driving habits?  

Personally I don't see the point in driving a ""soft roader"" especial if you live in a town or city and only hang take-outs off the diff lock but its a personal choice and who am I to disagree if you think owning something like a Fiat Panda or a Subaru estate (both popular 4x4's in their day) is a valid lifestyle choice. 

I used to own Defenders and TLC's for years.  I used them mainly for work abroad but I also used to use them in the UK as my daily vehicle as well.  There have been a few times I have recovered a stuck or water logged 4x4 in the winter over here but I have lost count of the times I have towed a 2x4 out of water, snow or mud because the driver didn't have the sense to turn round or not go out in the first place.  I guess I used to do something like 20+ impromptu recovery's a year because Mr Mondeo couldn't be arsed fitting winter tyres or carrying chains.  

Please don't tar all 4x4 owners with the same brush.  Some own 4x4's because they are work vehicles, some own them because they want their car to last 20 or 30 years, some are off road enthusiasts, some want to tow stuff and some own then just because they want a practical 7+ seat vehicle that does better MPG on the whole than a people carrier.... and if you know what you are doing, you can drive them up to the windscreen through water for miles and get the seats wet...just because its fun.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Is your essential claim that the FT, the Guardian or the Times are no closer to an accurate representation of reality than the Sun or the Daily Star?

Yes and no. All would be models of reality projected through a corporate hierarchy which are usually tied very closely to greater imperialism, if not the military. They are nearly identical in structure and aim whilst being afflicted with orthodoxy. At least there is a certain honesty with tabloids, they make it obvious by the tits alone.

&gt; ...useless, or actively misleading, like some tabloids.

Let's take the BBC, what does it actually deliver? The fluff piece that is the One Show, Snog Marry Avoid, later Eastenders, New Tricks, Come Dancing are today's mean listings. I'd suggest much BBC energy is actually devoted to tabloid pursuits, just with marginally better packaging. I'd also include Middleton and other monarchal coverage. They also love a good pedo-scandal, shame they haven't the focus when it comes to crimes of the military. More importantly the consumer/producer paradigm almost always is disempowering but more importantly corruptive: producers are incentivised to farm consumers. That's the main reason Obromney was plastered all over the Guardian a few weeks back. Also they can't piss off their corporate sponsors, and that goes for the BBC. Has the BBC published one Manning cable?

I would put ""actively misleading"" down to the legacy of institutions like the ministry of information and other pysop activity. Propagandists literally in the military went on to pursue careers in media. It's the reason why things like the Prince Harry fluff pieces can be pushed out through all publications with military precision, or why Israel isn't roundly and persistently condemned as an apartheid abomination.

Another idea is that people have a unidirectional relationship with a brand, many ""love the BBC"". It being anthropomorphised into ""Auntie"" underlines this idea.  That's just the other side of the coin to hating (or loving) the Dailymail. They are all constructs of marketing. The counter relationship would be building bidirectional relationship with real people.

I might even not like the idea of the journalist, I much prefer experts speaking candidly. I don't think the world would be any worse off if both the BBC and Guardian fell.

true,delqhic,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; Do you have any ideas on what you'd do, if you decide to drop your A-Levels? Other than going to college and teaching yourself a programming language or two?

Yeah, I'm looking at getting a part time job on the side, I've been applying at various places as a Retail Assistant kinda gag to help get me off my feet. Not what I want to do as a career obviously.

&gt; Do you know what programming language you're looking at? I haven't written a line of code for a number of years, but the ""rules"" that applied back then still apply now - you need to know what you want to do with said language. I.E. don't learn the 21st century equivalent of BASIC [i.e Java] if you want to do something in-depth.

Yeah, I've been looking at C++ and Java as they seem to be the most common/popular ones therefore the best ones for a beginner to start with.

&gt; If you're going to go self-employed; Self-employed doing what?

This may sound like too much of a longshot or a goal for the distant future, but I watched Indie Game: The Movie a month or so ago and doing something along those lines would be my ultimate goal. I'm obviously not basing my plans around a documentary/movie, I do realise the consequences and the huge potential liabilities that could come with going into something like that, but I really think it's what I want to go into and with the right dedication and application then I can do it. I also realise it's a risky field to work in and obviously working at a company while still doing the same job would be just as good a move.

&gt; Now, saying all that? If you're gonna fuck up - or take a chance, then do it when you're young. There were a few threads here back when the GCSE and A-Level results were coming out, and there were quite a few examples of people who'd done badly at that level, who went on to get degrees.

I completely agree with this, I think that if I am going to go ahead and make a mistake, I need to do it now before it really, really becomes a big consequence.

&gt; Don't they have guidance teachers / staff at your school? If so sit down with one of them and outline what you want to do - they might have some advice. Similarly, most colleges will let you speak to a student rep. who can advise you on courses that are on offer.

Most younger (around 30 and below) programmers that I know that didn't get a degree are doing a CS degree in their spare time. That should tell you something.

With no A-Levels or degree you are going to need to have something pretty good (a great track record, a really nice github profile, interesting open source contributions) on your CV in order for me to invite you for a telephone interview. Your biggest problem though will be making it onto the right persons desk in the first place. If there are too many HR / recruiter stages then you might get filtered before you make it there.

There are plenty of paths in this career, particularly if you show real talent. You might want a better plan before going down this road though.

--

&gt;Yeah, I'm looking at getting a part time job on the side, I've been applying at various places as a Retail Assistant kinda gag to help get me off my feet. Not what I want to do as a career obviously.

It's a good avenue, to bring in some money, but retail is a hard sector to get into. You've got your age to your advantage - not wanting to be rude, but they can pay you less, as the minimum wage at your age is less. But from what I hear, they still want experience, and or the ability to work awkward shift, which might interfere with school / college.

&gt;Yeah, I've been looking at C++ and Java as they seem to be the most common/popular ones therefore the best ones for a beginner to start with.

And:

&gt;This may sound like too much of a longshot or a goal for the distant future, but I watched Indie Game: The Movie a month or so ago and doing something along those lines would be my ultimate goal. I'm obviously not basing my plans around a documentary/movie, I do realise the consequences and the huge potential liabilities that could come with going into something like that, but I really think it's what I want to go into and with the right dedication and application then I can do it. I also realise it's a risky field to work in and obviously working at a company while still doing the same job would be just as good a move.

*Indie Game* is an excellent little documentary. But it doesn't for one second highlight the work involved in creating a product. I started off in programming - by the time I sat my GCSEs I'd got an internship lined up with a local company, based on my portfolio, and example scripts.

It's a great field to get into, and can be rewarding, both financially, and in terms of personal development. But what Indie Game doesn't show you is the effort involved - my final two years, before I changed career? I was working 120 hours per **week**. Most people work around 120 hours per **month**.

The other difference is that when you get to that level of ability, you know what you want to do. You wouldn't, for example, use the same programming language to build a reddit like site as you would to develop a game.

If you want to get into game development, look around the internet for beginners guides. You want to lean towards a language that lends itself to that field, as opposed to one that's more business orientated, for example.

However, it's really a non-issue in comparison to the real corruption. Expenses claims take a chunk of the budget away, contrast that to the current system of ""jobs after office"" where MPs accept highly-paid salaries post-office in return for policy changes. This impacts us far more greatly than a simple extra cost, for example witness the destruction of the NHS in England &amp; Wales from Tory MPs with financial holdings in commercial health care bodies.

&gt;When asked why, Mr McKenzie, UKIP's spokesman for culture, media and sport, said that couples might raise the child to be gay.

&gt;""There are people out there who bring up their kids encouraging them to believe they are gay themselves,"" he said.

&gt;""If the child is properly heterosexual and they are put in foster homes without any thought or consideration of who they are or what their identity is, that's not right.  

&gt;""A child might be vehemently against being housed with a gay couple but you wouldn't know until they were older. Placing them with that couple deceives the child.

&gt;""If there's no alternative then maybe. If it's a case of being adopted by a gay couple or deportation then what can do you? But if you ask me, I'm not for heterosexual children being adopted by gay couples.""

&gt;When asked how he would know if a child was gay or heterosexual, Mr McKenzie replied: ""I don't want to get into that. It's a touchy subject.""

Just makes him sound like an idiot. As far as I know there's one gay relative in our family - a distant Uncle. Everyone one else is straight. Didn't stop me turning out the way I did.

Also his comment about children not wanting to be fostered by a gay couple smacks of ignorance on his part.

As an example, we have seen:

* Finn use his power three times (I think, once on a can and once on a potted plant and once in a storage room) 

* Jess has used hers twice (once to see Curtis and once to see Rudy 3) 

* Rudy 2 is only on screen briefly if at all anymore (slightly more exposure in rudy 3 episode, but still not much since 1 &amp; 2 got absorbed quickly)

* Curtis used his power one time (obviously). 

* We have also seen Finn's sister use some power that was neither explained nor used enough for us to quite figure out what it does

You seem to be under the impression that the personal wealth of the monarch is somehow tied up with lands etc. that come with a royal title? Not so.

There's a distinct difference between inherited wealth - something which I haven't been commenting on (and I doubt very many republicans would, by the by) - and inheritance of titles/rights that come about because you occupy a certain position in the establishment. With regard to overhauling the system, a fine example is removing hereditary peers from the Lords. That didn't seem to implode the government.

&gt; What would be the benefits of a republic?

At the most basic, but perhaps most important, level: equality. How much is that worth?

&gt; Would a president be elected instead?

Maybe. Dunno. Why does that matter about when discussing the fundamental issue? It seems some people immediately focus on that question, as though somehow it's a point against getting rid of the monarchy. ""But we'd have to do something different!""

Something concrete, a way in which she has inspired us, or shown us the way. I really can't think of anything.

true,textima,null,null,"I actually found this video much more interesting than Owen Jones' normal media appearances, where I find he comes across as a very orthodox left wing speaker, with a fresh face but few fresh opinions. It's a good argument for giving people space to explain themselves fully. He is certainly raising some important problems, even if I don't necessarily agree with his solutions. The key point was in the last third of the lecture, about the way in which low to middle income jobs have shifted from the industrial towards the service sector, and the way in which this has altered the power balance within society, because service sector jobs tend to be more transient, and may well be less skilled (at least to the degree that a service job requires transferrable rather than specific skills, which means it is probably easier to bring in a replacement). You might also add in the way in which globalization has opened people up to competition from abroad.

But I differ with Jones about what the solutions should be. We do have to have decent regulation which means that unskilled people aren't crushed in a free market economy, and trade unions which have a decent amount of power to protect their members, but I would simply not settle for the mass of the population doing these boring, rubbish, unskilled jobs. I would rather go for a Scandinavian solution, which is to embrace competition, competitiveness and free trade, and use the welfare state to skill up and educate the labour force, rather than trying to grab at businesses using top down laws, and having them slip through our fingers. Jones is one of these people who, as far as I can see, embraces an old-left position, but we have to bear in mind that these are a collection of opinions which differ from what would be considered left-wing, or progressive in other developed nations, particularly in Europe. In Germany, left wing parties recognize first and foremost that businesses must be profitable for jobs to be available, and they have a model of industrial relations which emphasises cooperation between workers and owners. Both Thatcherite and Anti-Thatcherites ardently desire polarization of industrial relations, just on one side or the other.

true,Pergatory,k9,K-9,"I'll admit I hadn't considered that possibility, but after playing it out in my head, I don't think it's how things will unfold. Here's my reasoning:

I don't think the Monks are time-active, so I don't think a time war would be in the fold even if there was a falling out between the two factions. River respects the Doctor too much to abuse time travel to that level. As for the possibility of the Silence going back to prevent themselves from allying with the Monks, I don't think that would be possible either. The Doctor's (faked) death is now supposedly a fixed point in time. Unless they can remove their alliance with the Monks while somehow still leading to the same chain of events that creates River and results in the Doctor's death (faked or not) at Lake Silencio, it would just lead to time falling apart like it did in The Wedding of RS when they altered the fixed point in time. Sure, the writers could write around this, but it seems unlikely.

In regards to the Doctor's name, River didn't learn his name at their marriage ceremony. What he actually whispered wasn't his name, but something like ""look in my eye."" The River we've seen in most episodes doesn't yet know his real name. I'm guessing he'll reveal it to her on his final night, where he gives her his special sonic screwdriver.

In fact, I feel like the question itself is another cool little easter egg, and we may never learn much more than we already know. What we already know is enough to piece together an idea of what happens. People have speculated what power the Doctor's true name might hold; bringing back the Time Lords, unlocking the time lock, or all these other crazy ideas.

I think it's far more simple than that, I think we've already seen the Doctor's name used and the power that speaking it can bring. We saw this in the episode Silence in the Library. River had but to whisper his name in the Doctor's ear, and earned his immediate trust. That's the power of the Doctor's name; it earns you the Doctor's trust. What could be more valuable in the Whoniverse? Who wouldn't kill for such a name?

I think the reason the name is so powerful is because it would let someone else take River's place as the Doctor's confidante/wife/whatever. Simply knowing the name, and how to use it, could secure you a position at the side of the most powerful being in all the cosmos. Or at least, maybe someone or something thinks they could do so, which leads to that entity setting up the scenario which will take place on the fields of Trenzalore at the fall of the 11th.

At least, that's another of my pet theories. :)",0,1353964873,null,0,false,0,c775hqq,t3_13thoe,t1_c775hqq,t1_c7743rq,null,1430506726,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

Every year without fail, I have to explain to other 4x4 users, that the laws of physics don't magically stop because you have four wheel drive.
Sure, proper 4x4's (not Chelsea tractors) can get an awfully long way through deep water, but you have to know how to drive through deep water. A diesel engine with a low-range gearbox is absolutely necessary for anything deeper than 2.5-3 feet. Provided certain provisions are made to specific parts of the engine (waterproofing all the hoses connecting a raised air intake, which is also known as a snorkel, going into the airbox; and ensuring axle breathers are in place &amp; long enough) you can drive through *very* deep water. Personally, I have driven through almost 6 foot deep water. Your pulse certainly races!

It is when it snows that most 4x4 drivers think that their vehicle is immune to skidding.

By the way, the situation you're in now is the most inexpensive and friction-free way of learning there is - don't waste it. If you hate sixth form, sort yourself out - don't worry about being treated like a child, you've got the rest of  your working life to complain about that.

I do admit that most people who drive what in this country we would call a Chelsea Tractor, are indeed plonkers.

However, there are a lot (certainly not a majority) of 4x4 owners &amp; users in this country, that are very responsible, who use their vehicles because it is the ideal vehicle to do whatever they are doing.
Farmers obviously spring to mind here, but there are a massive number of people who like going ""green laning"" which is the vehicular equivalent of going for a walk in the woods/outdoors. 
The majority of these folk certainly abide by a strict code of conduct for behaviour when they are using lanes that are open to walkers &amp; Horses etc. and this behaviour translates to on-road use too. We are well aware that people love to hate us, so generally don't try to antagonise other road users. I stress, I am generalising, there are obviously idiots amongst us in the specialised 4x4 community.

There is nothing obvious that you would need to get shipped. There are a few shops that sell American imported food - it's pricey but then so is shipping it over! Personally I always get my relatives to bring fruit rollups - just because they are my favourite :-) I'm sure you will find something you miss though!

There are also quite a few places that are within excellent commuting distance of Bristol, if you would rather be outside of the city centre. I know plenty of people that live in the countryside but commute in by bike.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Wait, what do you mean use your players better?

Rafa is well-known for his ability to bring organization and structure to the way in which a squad play. He knows how to work with shapes, which to employ, and he knows how the players should be operating with that system. Rafa is equally well known though for making poor choices as to which actual players to employ in which positions. It is well known that towards the end of his tenure at Liverpool and the duration of his Inter Milan career that he played players in positions they weren't comfortable in and often preferred players that didn't end up working. He is also well known for alienating many (I stress many) of his players and having tenuous relationships with owners and players. IN this way Rafa is very similar to AVB. Very good tactician but not as adept at getting the intended output due to poor managing of players on and off the pitch. Although I do think Rafa is a better tactician than AVB, knows the league better and has perhaps learned from some of his mistakes

RDM on the other hand can be a rather predictable tactician. He always makes the practical choice and lacks the experiences to be a top top tactician. He does however, IMO, have a better understanding of how and when to use players. Last season RDM turned Lampard's season around by deploying him deep. He used Ramires on the left to counteract Maggio and it worked perfectly in our 4-1 win against Napoli (not a fluke). We got very lucky against Barcelona, but he made all of the right calls and got our team to believe they could do it. Bayern were another vastly superior team in terms of personnel, and he neutralized their biggest threats, Robben and Lahm, through the use of Bertrand. This season he used Oscar extremely well against Juve (1st game) and Arsenal. Not to mention he got Mazacar playing really well.

&gt;going forward in patches (note in patches part)

Despite having only 1 completely out of form striker, RDM did a pretty good job with our offense. 

&gt;n.e.v.e.r. looked remotely convincing as a defensive unit.

I'm going to disagree completely here. Despite looking defensively fragile this past month I think that this statement is an exaggeration. Immediately following AVBs departure we became much more defensively sound. We defended better and did a better job of winning the ball back. I don't just mean against Barca and Bayern. We defended well in the FA cup last year, against Newcastle and Arsenal this year.

I will agree though that this season we have defensively weak. But I think it still remains to be seen whether or not this was a matter of personnel or a matter of the manager. RDM was instructed to play more attacking football this year. When JT and Ashley Cole, and Lampard got injured we started to notice that the midfield balance was off and the defensively solidity was gone. I'm sure you noticed that against Man City (Rafa) we looked good defensively (clean sheet but Man City also wasted chances) but had no attack. The issue for me is balance. We need some more depth at CM if we want a team that can both attack AND defend. The only way to really prove this though will be if Rafa has the same struggles until replacements come in. So only time will answer this question fully.

&gt;Rafa is capable of a great many things. 

He certainly is, given the right circumstances and group of players. My issue with his appointment is that I think it didn't accomplish much. I think our style of play will change a little but without proper reinforcements (striker &amp; CM) my expectations have not changed at all. 

Anyway I do see where you are coming from. Sorry for the long response but I hope I can help you to see where I'm coming from as well.

2) Versatile attacking midfielder

I don't think we need all 3 of these things, but #1 IMO is a must. We desperately require sort of a tempo-setting composed passing midfielder with good range. A player in the vein of Mikel Arteta would not be impossible to acquire. 

In a perfect world I think we'd sign said deep-lying midfielder and then a forward in the vein of Remy; someone who can play on the right but also up front by himself.

With little boys, their penises are unable to retract the foreskin until they are much older, 6-7 ish but even then its not till a few years older that it goes right back. There is no gunk as such, random bits of fluff on the end but thats about it. If you teach them to wash it in the bath, and gently retract the skin back as they get older it encourages them to be clean, and for the foreskin not to be too tight.

&gt;the Daleks get stale easily and they are limited on screen

I disagree. Just because the writers tend to immediately jump to expected, obvious things like ""they want to bomb reality"", doesn't mean that they inherently get stale. I think Asylum of the Daleks had a fantastic plotline/idea and that *just* happened.

It happens all the time in TV. Fans latch onto a certain character and want to see more of them. To play it safe, the showrunners/writers stick to what the character already is instead of trying to change them at all. The fact that they have this problem with the Daleks *at all* in Doctor Who astounds me, since they change and reinvent everything else all the time. They're just touchy on messing with the poster child villain.

Reina, Gerrard and Torres are the only guarantees for me. If attempting to build a cohesive team and not just pick the top 11, the Gerrard/Torres combination puts Torres ahead of Owen. I like my CB in pairings, and Hyypia/Carra edge out our current two barely.

I like Finnan more defensively over Glen Johnson, and he still was solid going forward. He also played well with Kuyt. Enrique is the most impressive of a failed lot of LBs. He's a little weaker offensively than Riise but offers much much more defensively. His recent play with Suarez shows good understanding too.

Suarez, Kuyt are both hard workers that can open up space for Torres and Gerrard. Both can also score in the clutch.

I think people putting Lucas in the discussion for CDM or CM are ridiculous tbh. The Masch/Xabi duo was best in the world, bar none. I think Didi offers a bit more going forward than Masch, and is equally adept at defensive work.

true,notnotcitricsquid,cnty-uk,Stafford,"I don't agree, but it does raise an interesting point (don't worry, I'm not going to suggest we burn *the gays*).

Sexuality is not this *or* that, it can be from one extreme to the other with any number of places in between (see the [Kinsey Scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale)). Society (not unique to England) is not very open about sexuality and in general people are *encouraged* to be straight (just 'cause it fits our reproductive stuff) and so it's entirely plausible that being with gay parents will encourage a child to identify as not straight. Not because gay people make children gay, but because gay people are (naturally?) much more open and the child of gay parents would not be put in the situation where they have to hide their sexuality. For example I'm not a 0 on the Kinsey scale, but I identify as straight 

I guess what I'm saying is no matter what happens, if you give 100 children to 100 pairs of adoptive gay parents and 100 children to 100 pairs of straight adoptive parents I'd bet more of the 100 children given to gay parents would later identify as not straight, not because they were made not straight by their parents, but because their parents were open about it. 

I think ideally a child should have a mother and father because that's how our species worked, but then ideally we wouldn't have divorce, alcohol, drugs or I'm a celebrity.

As an aside, the one thing this entire debate seems to miss is that so what if gay parents make kids gay? It's not like we're hurting for people to reproduce and being gay certainly doesn't exclude you from reproducing, hell the world might be better off if 25% of the population ends up gay. The only downsides of being gay (aside from being unable to make spawns) is how some parts of society treat gay people, which is surely a problem that can't be addressed with ""let's avoid making as many gays as possible"", we don't treat racism by putting all the brown people in birmingham, neutering them and then hope if that's the only place they get beaten up nobody will realise it's a problem.",0,1353974431,null,0,1353974626,0,c778byb,t3_13txz2,t1_c778byb,t3_13txz2,null,1430508179,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

true,Miserable_Bugger,uk,"Royston, Hertfordshire","Land Rover's are not sealed very well at all &amp; some may see this as poor build quality, but is in fact the exact opposite. I shall explain...

If you go through anything deeper than the bottom of the doors (about 2 foot), water will seep in through the door bottom &amp; puddle around your ankles. Depending how long you are in the deep water for, it normally gets to be only a small puddle &amp; rarely over an inch or two deep. It's a bit annoying, but this is cancelled out by the fact that driving through deep water is probably the most fun you can have in a Land Rover because it is so unnatural to do it.

If your vehicle is particularly old &amp; the doors are going a bit rotten at the bottom, which is common due to the reaction between the steel of the chassis &amp; the aluminium body panels, coupled with water ingress through the inside of the doors &amp; the fact that your door seals will have deformed &amp; sqaushed out of shape, you may get a lot more water than a few inches. I have seen chest deep water in a cab before.

Now, why I say that water leaking in is not a symptom of poor build quality, is that all working Land Rover's will not have any carpeting in the interior, just a basic rubber mat covering the transmission tunnel. The floor panels are just sheets of metal with nothing other than removable rubber mats covering them.
There are all sorts of little holes everywhere, where it looks like bolts are missing. This is not the case, the holes are there on purpose.

As LR's are vehicles built for a purpose, they may often be put to use in harsh environments. In the UK most LR drivers actually seek out relatively small fords &amp; rivers to cross occasionally, but in other parts of the world, the Land Rover may be put to work in *proper* harsh terrain on a regular basis.
If you find yourself crossing a very deep river in the middle of Africa somewhere, where turning back &amp; going by a different route is not possible as the route you are on is the only road for 200 miles, then cross you must. I am shortening the process here, there are many things to consider before you do.

If you find that the vehicle is losing traction on the river bed, usually due to soft sand or mud, and/or the current of the river is starting to lift the vehicle &amp; put it in a potential wash away situation, then LR's are designed to overcome this...

...open the doors &amp; position the vehicle such that the river actually flows *into* the cabin. You will flood the vehicle out by taking on a couple of tons of water, sinking the axles deeper into the loose sand/mud, usually onto a firmer surface, enabling you to find traction &amp; continue forward motion.

When you get out the other side, the water has somewhere to run out of! You will have blown all the fuses, but any working Land Rover will only have basic electrics anyway, for just this reason.

Once again, this is an advanced maneuver &amp; is not something that is undertaken willy-nilly. If the river is far too deep, the vehicle can be washed away &amp; the driver killed or injured, but this maneuver is an option that can be done if possible.",0,1353976656,null,0,1353977190,0,c778y7x,t3_13tcar,t1_c778y7x,t1_c777pwc,null,1430508470,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

The only part of his body over the line was his arm, which doesn't count as offside. You can kind of see it in this image too. Chico's left foot is definitely keeping Enrique onside. 


Yet despite him making the wrong call you can't really be too harsh on the linesman on this occasion, it was far too close to be able to see for certain at the time. Doesn't make it any less annoying though. It's times like this, and the Everton case, you long for some video-replays being allowed to assist big decisions in games.

Let's not start saying stuff like that. Daleks post-2005 are still Daleks, even if you don't agree with an aspect of them. I know what they were like in their first appearance, I'm getting through classic right now (albeit slowly). I like the classic Daleks so far from what I've seen of them. I'm just saying that these days, new fans wouldn't take kindly to a villain with such an obvious and silly weakness.

With the change to more modern pacing, the writers finding a way to incorporate height/stairs/ladders into every single Dalek story as an advantage for the heroes is what we would talk about in terms of their annoying attributes.

IMO Assaidi hasn't earned a starting spot against a big team.  Although he is quite technically gifted like Sterling, so far he has been quite wasteful.  He tries to take on too many defenders at once and doesn't look to create chances for other players as much as he should.

However, it is an interesting hypothetical, and one that has me torn.  On the one hand, Pep is a manager who built one of the best sides in the history of the beautiful game.  He would undoubtedly bring a lot to Liverpool, from the youth setup through the first team.  Having him as our manager would also make it *significantly* easier to attract top players.

But on the other hand, Brendan has done nearly everything right so far, and only an idiot would say he deserves to be sacked.  He's brought in good players, he's been nurturing the youth in the right way, and he's slowly but noticeably beginning to implement his style (a style which helped Swansea, a team that, based on their players, should probably have been close to battling relegation last season, finish mid-table).  He has shown he can handle Liverpool in the right way, and is taking the long-term view he needs to take, and, more importantly, I get the sense from his performance thus far that he has the brains and the balls to re-build the club in the way it needs to be re-built.

Thinking about it and that haunting song (that i knew before that show..and when i first heard that soft beginning while curtis was on the phone...i knew what was to come) He was the last thing we had. I miss him dreadfully. I adored curtis and his story line. He knew what him living as zombie would do.. he took the responsibility like a man. I miss him, but I'm proud of him.

I LOVE RUDY. The moment he showed up i thought ""well damn..i have a dirty lady boner..."" I love that pervy, horny, tattooed, smart-ass skinny man.

They ended popular American shows Friends and Seinfeld at the right time. The show ended ADORED by its fans. Nothing but good memories. Imagine if that show kept going? It would be like the last seasons of that 70s show when Eric went to Africa. Fuck that. 

Anywhoo.... Misfits is great. I'm excited, and anxious. I can't stop watching. Also.. they do death and dying very well in that show. There are some characters where i'm like ""oh shit.."" in surprise. And then there are the ones that make you cry. that pull on those emotional strings.

What I can say for sure is that I think the people that this is probably trying to characterize, and mischaracterize, are the Welsh who are afraid of losing their language. I think that's a valid fear to have when it seems like English is great at pretty much obliterating other languages it comes into contact with.

Does everyone have a good experience learning Welsh? Obviously not. Is it right to demonize it? Not at all. Sure, Welsh is, upon first glance, fairly weird looking and intimidating, but if anyone with some sense took 10 minutes to look up the alphabet and pronunciation it wouldn't even be that way. Over the last few years I've become a fan of Gruff Rhys, Y Niwl, Colorama, and Alun Tan Lan. I've spent a few months learning Welsh and expect to continue learning it as soon as I get my act back together (which I will do soon enough!). 

I guess what my point is, is that people are assholes when they don't take the time to try to understand someone else's language and the culture attached to that. Those people can fuck off as far as I'm concerned.

I have zero Welsh heritage, but I love the shit out of the language, and anyone who tries to degrade it for whatever reason will surely hear from me if I see them doing it. /rant

We have a great fucking team and I honestly don't see us buying a player that would improve the team by such a large margin that he's worth the price that we pay for him. We just need to keep growing together as a team and adjust to the 3-5-2 formation (under proper circumstances). 

Except De-Jong, I will always want De-Jong back in the team. I miss the Lescott, De-Jong, and Richards trio :(. Maybe it's what we've been missing this whole time and it hasn't been a matter of strategy the entire time.

I mean, seriously ? What's the big issue with nerve endings ? Teeth have nerve endings, and toothache is a bitch - if I could have those removed at birth, I'd happily have done it.

Ever caught your member in your zipper ? Hurts like fuck, and I'm circumcised (medical reasons, before you start attacking my religious beliefs - of which I have none). I can't imagine what it feels like for uncut males. And sensitivity ? So suddenly it's an asset being able to come more quickly ? I think the female population might disagree with that.

Anyway, having a bell end with a scaly, tortoise-shell like consistency means I am able to knock nails into wood without a hammer, and bore holes in drywall without injury - yeah, yeah, I'm exaggerating, but when you listen to the arguments of the other side, they have the same tendency towards hyperbole.

Circumcision, done in a proper medical setting, not in some dingy backroom with a crappy knife and some Jews teeth (which I agree is fucking barbaric) - is perfectly safe. I fail to see why this consent argument is required for THIS procedure, and not for say cosmetic defects such as strawberry birthmarks or harelips. And let's be honest, these are ALSO non-life-threatening conditions, but you wouldn't think twice about putting your kid under the knife in these circumstances.

It's all about perception and culture and tradition (with a fair dose of religion thrown into the mix) - some things are considered defects, others are not. Hell, most unreligious people in the US will have their baby done simply so he doesn't look different from all the religious circumcised males. Who's in the wrong ?

At the end of the day, the pro-life pro-choice brigade will state it's the parents choice if they abort their baby, but those same people will be anti-choice when it comes to cutting off a (debatably) useless bit of skin.

Hell, don't dare touch their penis, but overfeeding them with sugars and trans-fats and not encouraging them to do any exercise until they resemble fucking umpa-loompas is perfectly okay. If you would take away a parents choice to make decisions for their kids, then surely ANYTHING you do that is potentially deleterious to your kids health should be considered under the same rules.

So if you legally ban circumcision, you should legally ban ALL piercing, ALL non-life-threatening cosmetic surgery, and indeed ALL actions by the parents that might affect the future health and wellbeing of the child.",0,1354007650,null,0,false,0,c77g343,t3_13tkak,t1_c77g343,t1_c77ery8,null,1430511939,-7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-7

People who seek to preserve an old cultural tradition should be encouraged to do so - but not at the cost of imposing it on people who don't want it.

The blunt fact is that English is the preferred language to use for the majority of people, and putting up Welsh language signs is not going to change that any more than a person reading out bits of the Bible in the local market will convert atheists to Christianity.

I've got mixed feelings about this. I'm on my fourth Welsh course, which I've been attending somewhat patchily over about ten years, and I'm still a beginner. I  enjoy learning the language but as an adult it's *very* hard. For an adult who's self-employed, and works long hours, and struggles to get to two lessons a week (never mind the sodding homework) it's extremely hard to get to any level of proficiency.

(The added irony is that sometimes you get so knackered by trying to learn the language that you pass up the rare opportunities to actually practice it on patient friends in the pub, because you're tired and just want to relax for a bit)

It's not impossible, but people I know in public sector jobs who get time off work to attend lessons (and some get those lessons paid for) are obviously at a huge advantage. 

The most important thing to remember is that if you're in a country where you *need* to speak the language to get by, you'll *learn* enough of the language quickly. (yes, I've tried it) That's not the case here, because everyone speaks English. It doesn't matter whether anyone *likes* this state of affairs, but the ubiquity of English means that Welsh is sailing against the wind.

So it needs artificial help to survive. Which - perhaps inevitably - leads to the excesses described in the DM. I believe there's probably some truth in most of that stuff. 

It's not possible to separate the Welsh language from nationalism, or nationalism from politics. The loudest and most bellicose politicians (and language activists) belie the fact that most first-language Welsh speakers are perfectly normal, reasonable people. 

We should really be having a discussion about whether national identity is something we want to perpetuate at all. The only people - in any country - who make a fuss about it are those who think it's under some kind of threat. (And they can *always* find a threat. Anyone like to suggest a single country on earth where the national identity *isn't* claimed by someone to be under threat?)

All languages change, all the time. Sometimes they die out. It's rather ecological, really. So we talk about what *ought* to happen, and it makes about as much sense as asking whether birds *ought* to fly south for winter. 

The future will unfold, and Wales' society will to some extent be influenced by the machinations of a bunch of aspiring but sadly incompetent Machiavellians in Cardiff. People who feel very strongly about the Welsh language - for and against - will continue to make a fuss. Everyone else will get on with trying to make a living and bring their children up not hating one another.

There's been studies on this, turns out the amount of children raised by gay parents turning out gay is no higher than those raised by straight parents.

Also to your last statement, are you really comparing gay parents to Drugs and Alcoholism? Surely the fact you have a collection of willing, loving and suitable people willing to take a child and and raise them as their own is something to be positive about? There are a lot of kids who need good homes and I think having a load of couples who cannot have, but want children is a good asset.

Not necessarily. The recent (unsustainable) boom in credit gave people the ability to buy a home where historically none existed. So you had people moving out of home as soon as possible. If this trend returned to historical norms then there would be plenty of houses available.

Personally, I would have had it done as a child but now as an adult I will not. When I have a child, I would like the option to have him circumcised as a baby so he can avoid the pain when he's older. Obviously, I would explain to him when he's older why it was done.

Banning it is not a solution, more education is needed. These people didn't know it could be done on the NHS, if they did this could have been avoided. Ask new parents in the hospital if they've thought about circumcision and then give them a leaflet or whatever so they are more well informed.

My mother was raised by her father after her mother died. She turned out to be a stable person.

What screws up kids isn't the fact that they live in a single parent family but the circumstances that had lead to them only having a single parent. If one of your parents had died in a car crash when you were a baby and you come from a relatively stable family then you would most likely be ok. But if you only have one parent because one of your parents died of a drug overdose and you have a chaotic family life *then* a child would turn with serious issues.

A child raised by a gay couple would not be any worse or any better off than in any other family. If the couple are good, capable parents with a stable home then the child should flourish and that's been shown in study after study. To have a child they must either find a sperm donor/surrogate (which takes a lot of time and money) or go via an adoption agency (which takes a lot of time and vetting by the Authorities). Either way it means those gay people who do not have stable homes would most likely find it very hard to have children either through adoption or surrogacy/donors. This is in contrast to straight people who can make a child regardless of money or situation in their lunch break if they wanted to (not that I am saying straight people are any better or worse parents than gay people)

This gives you a confidence interval of about 13% with a confidence level of 95%.

So, If they picked houses, at random, 95% of the time the average would likely be within the range +-13% of this value. What you ask is ""Is this sample set a fair representation of the population"" not ""Is my conclusion correct"".

This seems like a valid representative sample size to me, the confidence isn't particularly high (and wouldn't be enough for say, a conclusion in physics) but, assuming a normal distribution of values, this is within about 2 standard deviations of the mean, this seems to be standard practice in economics and social science disciplines.

The sample alone also isn't the only basis for their conclusion but it is a reasonable amount of statistics to back up some empirical investigation.

&gt; They made a conclusion about the London housing market on a sample of what is basically, half a street?

This is not a valid concern; what they appear to be analysing is the subset of roughly 100,000 house sales above a certain value deemed to be high for London; they haven't picked 60 sales on the same street.

If we swapped this around and you said you wanted to see if a drug was killing patients. You, as a doctor/hospital/whatever, had prescribed this drug to 60 patients. 100,000 people in the country had also been prescribed this drug. something like 40 out of your 60 die of a heart attack when they weren't at risk of a heart attack; Your sample gives you a confidence interval within two standard deviations of the mean.

true,jimmy17,null,null,"&gt;There will always be downvotes on anyone who disagrees with the uncircumcised hivemind - that proportion of the community who despite their best efforts to justify their position using the ""nerve endings and sensitivity issues"" arguments, are basically just try to feel better about their smeg filled bell ends by inferring that circumcised males are somehow inferior.

I'm circumcised and think circumcision on children for religious reasons should be banned. It kind of sounds like you have an inferiority complex rather than an argument.

&gt;I mean, seriously ? What's the big issue with nerve endings ? Teeth have nerve endings, and toothache is a bitch - if I could have those removed at birth, I'd happily have done it.

For medical reasons yes. would you allow a parent to remove all their child's teeth for religious reasons? Also would you say that it's acceptable to circumsise girls now 'cos nerve endings don't matter.


&gt;Ever caught your member in your zipper ? Hurts like fuck, and I'm circumcised (medical reasons, before you start attacking my religious beliefs - of which I have none). I can't imagine what it feels like for uncut males. And sensitivity ? So suddenly it's an asset being able to come more quickly ? I think the female population might disagree with that.

Better feeling doesn't mean you come quicker. You have no imagination.

&gt;At the end of the day, the pro-life pro-choice brigade will state it's the parents choice if they abort their baby, but those same people will be anti-choice when it comes to cutting off a (debatably) useless bit of skin.

Can you honestly not see the difference. Abortion is about the rights of a woman *own* body over that of an unthinking, unconscious foetus. Circumcision is the right of the child to choose what is done with *his own body*. It effects no one else. So Yeah, I am pro-choice in both cases. Unless you really don't understand the word choice in this context.

&gt;Hell, don't dare touch their penis, but overfeeding them with sugars and trans-fats and not encouraging them to do any exercise until they resemble fucking umpa-loompas is perfectly okay. If you would take away a parents choice to make decisions for their kids, then surely ANYTHING you do that is potentially deleterious to your kids health should be considered under the same rules.

It shouldn't be ok. I think if you are killing your child like that then yeah, their should be sanctions. I know we probably disagree here but a child is not your property to do with as you please. It is a human being with rights protected by the state.

Now, I don't know whether the quality of education is different. It *may* be, irrespective of what one thinks of Welsh. I fully expect there are good and bad schools on both sides. The questions it raises are:


(a) whether thousands of non-Welsh-speaking Welsh people should have the language thrust upon them and their children, as a result of a political ideology; and

(b) whether for some reason a different expectation exists for English incomers, and whether this amounts to a vague moral obligation to be sensitive to the place and the history where you live (which I can sympathise with) or an absolute requirement (which I reject entirely).

Going back to the schools: there is a perception, among both Welsh and English people, that the Welsh language is turning into a requirement.

....*free because employers are able to claim the cost of an apprentice minimum wage from the government

There are also training courses that the providers put you on. To a degree it has to be lowest common denominator but from what I've been told it's a tick-box exercise, people have great CVs and good interview skills but are put on CV building courses of benefit to nobody. 

Since a lot of vacancies and courses are for apprentices you can only go on said courses if you're not overqualified, iirc providers can override this and put people on at the provider's expense but that would cost so they rarely do so. The best thing about the providers according to the people I know is that they pay for travel to/from interviews.

true,mister_zurkon,eng-durham,Durham,"The problem OP, is that your school has been feeding you bullshit and telling you it's prime steak. The UK educational system is a minefield of qualifications that are equivalent on paper but are not considered equivalent by further educational institutions or employers.

Please don't take this as belittling in the slightest, but your Diploma or BTEC that is meant to be equivalent to 4 GCSEs, well just try to find anyone (especially a teacher, in private) who can say that ""equivalent"" with a straight face and without doing little air-quotes with their fingers. That's not your fault, it is the fault of schools and successive governments. Likewise a double BTEC in IT might help you get helpdesk-type work, but it isn't going to help you become a professional computer programmer - your competition will have done Maths, Further Maths and Physics A-levels and a computer science degree. 

It really sounds like you will be happier if you leave school and go to a sixth-form college. People who want to be treated like adults flourish in such places (though there is the associated responsibility - likely no-one will stop you going to the pub rather than class and failing).

**Your 16 to 18 (or 19) education is extremely important** - not as an end to itself but because in this day and age it is unlikely to be the whole story. No harm will be done to you if it takes you an extra year due to changing institutions, no-one will care about that at all.

* We don't know if he will be a starter at Swansea, why would they start someone who doesn't know the system already?

* It is still Rodgers system for the most part at Swansea, but we can't really know how much it has changed in these months.

* We can't guarantee that he will play the same position at Swansea that is intended for him here. Maybe they want him as a deep lying mid while we want him as an attack minded one.

* It could be very beneficial to learn a system with players that you are going to be playing with in the future, you learn their movements and your role much better. Also, since the system is fairly new at Liverpool, it will probably be modified from what we can see at Swansea, a system doesn't exist on it's own, it has to be molded alongside the players at the club.

* Why would Swansea take him on loan?

I think there was something else I wanted to say, but forget. Anyways, I believe that a loan would isolate him from the first team and maybe hinder or jepordise his place at the club. It's not the same as Shelvey who went out on loan without really playing for us, plus he was 19, while Hendo is 22, I feel it would be a blow to his confidence if we just sent him away.

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","&gt; Are you sure Primus isn't just setting you up a standard telephone line through BT Openreach?

They will be. 

Thing is (and this is where things get confusing), BT Openreach is a totally separate company.

They're part of the same group, but ignore that for now. 

BT Openreach own the wire from your house to the telephone exchange; there is no way you can avoid that unless you live in a cabled area. You and I cannot contract with BT Openreach, they ONLY deal with other telephone companies and ISPs. Seriously, if you ring them up they'll politely tell you to go elsewhere.

When that wire hits the phone exchange, the signal travelling on it is split. Data goes to a device called a DSLAM; voice goes into the phone exchange equipment.

BT Openreach do not own anything else. The DSLAM is owned by an ISP. If your ISP does not have their own equipment in the exchange, they'll contract with another ISP that does - this is frequently BT Wholesale but it could be anyone.

You and I don't deal with BT Wholesale either. 

The company you and I deal with is BT **Retail**. They're a totally different company again, they handle selling telephone packages to individuals and businesses.

Note that under telco regulations, BT Openreach **have** to supply anyone else under the same terms as BT Retail. 

As it happens, Openreach are by all accounts pretty good. They offer a range of contracts with account managers, service level agreements, the lot. BT Wholesale aren't too bad either as these companies go.

But they don't tell the retail phone company how to operate; that's down to the retail company. If the company that deals with you and I is staffed by a team of poorly-trained chimpanzees... there's your problem.

So why would the retail companies so often be staffed by the aforementioned chimps? 

Simple. The wholesale price of line rental from BT Openreach is [£98.81 per year](http://www.openreach.co.uk/orpg/home/products/pricing/loadProductPriceDetails.do?data=vZC%2BGHIiu80GtUKWLu%2BtzAfqMZEuYNVwUnHGezzgOd1UNeIS4WkJBRh6z%2FRUAIt8maxtgrEro1A7%0Aw5V8nzAZpQ%3D%3D). (Seriously, it's public information, you can look it up). Getting it connected is [£50.44 (£43.33 if there was already a line in place but it's been disconnected; transferring an existing line is £3.29)](http://www.openreach.co.uk/orpg/home/products/pricing/loadProductPriceDetails.do?data=ccWy9ZJoVtf1gb2YRVL3pYSkcG%2Bc%2B30URCuKygKmgSNUNeIS4WkJBRh6z%2FRUAIt8maxtgrEro1A7%0Aw5V8nzAZpQ%3D%3D).

This means when you move into a new place and the previous line was cut off, you're costing your supplier £141.33 in the first year. If they charge you, say, £12 line rental per month, they make about £2.70 in that year on line rental.

Out of that £2.70, they've got to pay someone to take your order (or set up a website to do so), bill you and put someone in a call centre you can ring up if something goes horribly wrong. 

Frankly, you're lucky to get the chimp.",0,1354027064,null,0,false,0,c77ilbx,t3_13v8it,t1_c77ilbx,t1_c77i4do,null,1430513100,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"&gt; I'm circumcised and think circumcision on children for religious reasons should be banned. It kind of sounds like you have an inferiority complex rather than an argument.

If it's *solely* for religious reasons, then I'd agree with you. But there are many valid medical and cultural reasons that have nothing to do with religion.

&gt; For medical reasons yes. would you allow a parent to remove all their child's teeth for religious reasons? Also would you say that it's acceptable to circumsise girls now 'cos nerve endings don't matter.

You'll note I said IF I could have the nerves removed from my teeth ... not the teeth themselves. But way to deliberate mis-comprehend what I said, it makes your position *so* much stronger. And male circumcision is not done with the express intention of removing nerve endings, that's a side effect rather than the end result. So another disengenious argument from your side, you're getting good at this.

Okay, take an example that does make sense ... the appendix. If it was an available option to have it removed during babyhood ... rather than wait until it bursts and you have 12 hours to either operate or die ... hell yes, I'd elect to have it done during babyhood.

&gt; Better feeling doesn't mean you come quicker.

Then why such the *obsession* about sensitivity. Every single human being will have a different level of sexual activity and pleasure, there is no *standard* level to form a yardstick, regardless of whether you've been cut or not. In all the studies I've seen done, there was no loss in feeling or sexual excitement after adult circumcision ... it's just a strawman thrown about to try and muddy the waters.

&gt; Circumcision is the right of the child to choose what is done with his own body.

Hence my comments about all the other non-necessary medical / cosmetic procedures, which you completely failed to address in your reply. A parent has a duty to try and do what he thinks is best for his / her child. If you want to start legislating about what is a ""good"" parent, and what is a ""bad"" parent based on you own personal opinion, then you're going to run into a serious roadblock.

&gt; I know we probably disagree here but a child is not your property to do with as you please.

In actual fact, until they reach the age of 18, that's exactly what they are. Parents make decisions for their children every day because they are not capable of making it for themselves. Not all parents get it right ... but most of them do.

At the end of the day, people have been being circumcised for 1000s of years, and it's had no adverse affect on them whatsoever. I have never found myself lamenting the fact I'm missing a bit of skin, any more than I lament the fact that I've had to had teeth pulled as they went bad.

If you want to equate the ONLY reason for being circumcised is because of religion then you are sorely misguided. Presented with all the pros and cons, is it not a parents right to make that choice, not because their sky fairy told them to, but simply because they think it's the best for their child ?

what on earth gave that impression? That would be stupid... 

&gt; Also, I'm still confused by your 'not straight' argument. Are you honestly telling me it's only because someone says 'you know it's alright to be gay' that a born straight person will immediately say: ""I really might try a cock in my arse?""

No, I'm saying that nobody is 100% straight and nobody is 100% gay, there's a scale. You can be more straight than you are gay, or more gay than you are straight. If you are raised in a family where sexuality is not a ""secret"" issue and not one that is ignored then you're much more likely to be open about your sexuality.

My point was that a gay family is more likely to be open about sexuality because they've made a concious decision to identify as not straight. Straight is what we (society) consider to be ""normal"" and the ""default"", so someone can say they're straight without ever considering their sexuality but someone that identifies as gay has to have considered their sexuality. Therefore if you have 100 straight parent families they are less likely to be 100 pairs of parents that have made a concious decision to identify as straight. If you have 100 gay parent families almost all will have made a concious decision to understand their own sexuality (because by default we're assumed to be straight). THEREFORE a family of gay parents is more likely to be open about sexuality with their children than a straight family...

I'm not saying that gay parents make children gay, I'm saying gay parents are more likely to be open about sexuality and their children will be more likely to actually consider their own sexuality. For example you can be more gay than you are straight, but still enjoy sex with the opposite sex. What if you're raised in an environment where sexuality is never mentioned, how will you ever consider that you actually like the same sex more? 

&gt; Same amount of kids are gay or straight, they're just more open about it?

Exactly. Sexuality is something you identify as, there are gay people that say they're straight and straight people that say they're gay. It's impossible to know what someones real sexuality is, so you have to trust what they say; if they're from an environment where sexuality isn't an issue and they've been encouraged to understand their own sexuality aren't they more likely to be honest? 

Maybe it'd turn out that more people are straight than they are gay with gay parents... but either way there would definitely be more ""real"" sexual identities coming from children of gay parents.

true,ikkleste,eng-yorkshire,Something like Yorkshire,"I actually have a by-election to vote in this week...

Middlesbrough. Frankly I have very little to go on. It's a Labour Safe seat, Sir Stuart Bell was an absentee MP, who wouldn't attend Hustings, didn't hold surgeries, by some reports spent half the year living in France, and was more interested in the Church than Middlesbrough; yet he was still elected for nearly 30 years.

I think the only way I'd vote Labour is to keep some one else out. As it is my vote is a token gesture to another party of my choice, most bookies have Labour at 1/100 to win.

I can't actually find out what Labour stand for. The candidate has nothing but how he's from the town on his website, and the general party rhetoric is how they've changed from New Labour but not what to. Miliband consistently frustrates me when I hear him on the radio, by saying that the coalition are wrong but not offering any alternatives.

The Lib Dems quite often have had my vote wasted on them in the past (like I say safe seat). I'm lefty leaning. if they were going to give up teh tuition fees debate, they should have held out for AV. The yes campaign should have been 10x better.

Greens haven't stood this time. I've voted for them in the past.
There's some PEACE party running who have the second best odds at 25/1. They appear to be campaigning on some sort of Utopia manifesto where they don't need to pay for anything. Part of me suspects they are a satire.

To be honest it all feels a little bit pointless. The same shower will get in. The Boro by-election is a forgone conclusion. My vote won't be for  Labour, and there isn't even a viable opposition I can vote against them. It's a token vote and there's not even anyone I feel like token voting for....
