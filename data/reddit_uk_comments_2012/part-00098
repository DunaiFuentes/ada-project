A retired member of the RAF, to learn a little respect. (it changed my life and I'm a better person for it.) I worked a part time job at my local pub but my meds ran out, I was having them shipped from the states. Within a week, I fainted on the job and was told to go home and rest. A good friend reminded me that I was eligible for dual citizenship. I applied and sent in my photo ASAP. I received a passport a short time later. My uncle, knowing how clueless I was instructed me to walk down to the closest NHS office. After showing my passport(damn American accent) I met with a generic GP and then told them my medication, my disorder, and how much consume in a month period. He said it would be available tomorrow from the chemist next door, and that he felt sorry for the week I went without it. In summery, and thank you all for the ability to rant, the NHS allowed me to talk to a human being about my needs, and not have to fight in order to get a life sustaining medication. It may cost more, and I'm certain I'm the minority, but I can't attest that withdrawing the financial incentive on healthcare will, at least in my case significantly improve quality of life.

[Hashing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) is where, instead of storing the password in your database as *password* you apply a hash to it ([MD5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) is one I am aware of) which, when applied to the same string will always give you the same output, so the hash of *password* is *5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99*. You store this hash, and then when the user gives you their password to log in, instead of comparing the password to your stored password, you compare the hashes.

The same applies to Brits. Most of us have no experience of any other healthcare system, so we have practically no point of reference.

true,ghostridethewhip,null,null,"I would expect Hazard at left wing, Mata down the middle, Oscar on the right if we decide to use these three players. Mata does not have pace or defensive capability, and we all saw what happened when he played on the wing last season (namely, the fullback behind him was completely neutralized in the attack because Mata is useless as defensive help). Better to keep Mata in the middle and let him focus on linking up with Torres/the wingers in the attack.

Oscar has been playing primarily on the right wing/RAM in the Olympics and has looked fantastic so far.

Like I said in the other thread, though, this question is basically irrelevant because all of our attackers will interchange throughout the match. Even Torres likes to drift out to the wing and play provider as we saw last season. I would bet that as far as RDM is concerned, it is great news that nobody quite knows where to expect our attackers to line up at any given time (makes it that much harder to plan against us).

Walker practiced with everyone else, BAE also had his own routine and didn't sign much either. Not sure what kind of injury he's still nursing, maybe the stuff from the end of last year?

It's mostly things beneath the surface. Starting a business in the US, for example, can be as easy as changing your tax filing status depending on the State it's in. In Germany, it seems like there are 50 hoops to jump through. I have the right to pursue happiness guaranteed to me by the Constitution, but not the right TO happiness. Many Americans seem lost on this fact lately with ridiculous prohibitions on mundane things. Another big one for me is the right to protect myself and my home without legal reprise. The US is a wild place in some regions, so these things are necessary whether some folks support carrying guns or not. 

Also, it bears reminding that the US is far from a homogeneous society, as many nations in Europe are. We are very much a nation of 50 semi-autonomous states that ALLOW the Federal entity to exist, whereas in Europe I noticed the Federal government seems to be the end all-be all.

Here in the UK all university training is heavily subsidised by the Government even more so for potential Doctors and Nurses so although they will accrue some personal debt, it is very small compared to their US counterparts. Unfortunatly that does seem to be changing. According to the BMA future Doctors could leave with a maximum debt of almost £70,000 ((approx $100,000) http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-18128637 Those are projected figures due to changes which will dramatically increase the amount of debt trainee doctors face. 

By contrast the only figures I could find for US trainee doctors are for tuition fees only with an average debt of $160,00 (in 2010) http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/opinion/29bach.html?_r=3&amp;ref=contributors and again it seem that these amounts are expected to increase dramatically.

As for earnings, Doctors in the uk do earn less (but have no practice or insurance costs as these are met by the NHS) than in the US but UK Doctors are seeing pay increases whilst in the US Doctors are facing a 10% cut http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2136707/Nearly-half-doctors-United-States-regret-career-path-pay-cuts-student-loans-bite.html

Thats a bit of a simplistic overview, there are other factors involved such as the interest rates and penalities of the debt which means that the debt is not as onerous here in the UK as it is in the states but it is still an increasing problem for both UK and the US.

I see the American Healthcare system like the Vetinary system in this country. You need to insure your pets against nasty expensive Vetinary treatments should something horrible happen.

Now the advantage of this is that most animals will only ever need minor work doing over there brief lives thus the insurance companies are quids in. If major work is required they will do their upmost to not pay out through some small print or other.

Then you get the drugs companies. Because insurance companies are footing the bill they can pretty much charge whatever the fuck they want. They can make it prohibitively expensive for an individual but as they are taking money from the vast pool of insurance cash it is passed over. If you removed insurance from the equation and everyone had to pay outright then the prices would drop.

Johnson - Agger - Skrtel - Enrique

Gerrard - Lucas - Hendo

Suarez - Carroll - Borini


**Carragher** - He's not leaving, and its almost blasphemous to suggest that he should. He's been loyal to the club, and he deserves to stay with us. Granted, he's not a starter anymore, and I think even he recognizes that due to his lack of pace and inability to keep up with the game, but he still has worth to the team. He'll be a great mentor, dressing room personality, and provide defensive cover in the FA Cup, Carling Cup, and Europa League when we don't really need Agger and Skrtel going up against weaker teams.

**Kelly** - I'm a big fan of Kelly, and I think he usually puts in solid shifts for us when he does play. I'd love to see him get more game time, and play every FA cup, and lower team game. Johnson was excellent at the Euro's and deserves the start, but Kelly also needs game time.

**Coates** - My minds still not made up over him, as he puts in some decent performances but also seems like a bit of a liability at times. He seems very composed for Uruguay but less so for us, but i'm assuming that with development he'll become a good player. Should be the first choice center back if either Agger or Skrtel get injured.

**Agger and Skrtel** - Legends. Gives us one of the best center back pairings in the premier league right now, if not the best. Work well with each other, and great tackling, and man marking.

**Johnson** - Great going forward, defensively improving, solid starter.

**Enrique** - Great when motivated and playing well, absolutely invisible when not. Hopefully Rodgers will bring out the best.

**Flanno + Robinson** - Left back cover, but don't deserve too much playing time.

**Gerrard** - Captain fantastic, sure-thing on the starting line up. 

**Lucas** - Should provide good cover, also one of the first names on the team.

**Hendo** - I honestly believe he'll come good this season. Last season he showed that he was a great passer, very composed on the ball, and almost never lost possession which should fit in well with Rodger's football. He'll continue developing, and will turn into a great player. Reminds me a bit of Cristiano Ronaldo in a sense when he first came to United, as he's got all the fundamentals of the game down, but just needs that final edge. Once he gets it he'll be a top class player.

**Shelvey** - First choice replacement, and should be coming off the bench in most games. Swap him with Hendo when needed.

**Cole** - We'll see which Cole we get come August and September, whether its the Chelsea Superstar, the Lille Squad Player/Starter, or the 2010/2011 reserve. I'm holding judgement until then.

**Suarez** - I'm putting it out in the universe, he's not a true striker. He's always looking for the channels, trying to cut in, and making space. Those attributes are absolutely fantastic, but he would be best employed as a second striker to help feed Carroll/Borini. His finishing also isn't top class.

**Carroll** - I hope he stays, considering that we have no true replacement. He can play in Rodger's system, and it looks to me like he'd be a better version of Danny Graham who was so effective against swansea. Needs to improve on conditioning and first touch massively though. I think he'll come good, and he'll lead the line well.

**Borini** - Haven't seen enough of him to make any definitive claims, but seems to be a good second striker/goal poacher player. Would be interesting to see how it works with Borini and Carroll leading the line and Suarez tucked in just behind. 

**Downing** - He was absolute shit for us last season. Worse than Charlie Adam. Looked lethargic, unconfident, and unadventurous. 80% of his passes went back to enrique, which is crap for a left winger. I think Rodgers might use him better, but I want to see a string of solid performances before we even consider letting him start ahead of Borini.

**Bellamy** - Love this man. Super Sub.

**Suso, Sterling, Morgan, Pacheco** - Too young, not experienced enough, and not yet good enough. Send them off on loan or play them in small matches.


**Players who Aren't Good Enough, Not Worth It, or Are Uncommitted** - Aquaman, Adam, Spearing. 



*Finally*, **Clint Dempsey** - Yes he played well last season. Yes he was Fulham's best player, managed to score a bag full of goals, and carry a mediocre fulham team in the league. But he's 29, will want high wages, Fulham will extort us, and he's just not worth it. Midfield is crowded, and he's not good enough to be a stand out, definite starter. Don't waste the 10 - 15 million pounds on him, pursue a younger, dynamic midfielder. ",0,1343673266,null,0,false,0,c5lnpsy,t3_xd698,t1_c5lnpsy,t3_xd698,null,1429508809,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,CyrilicHype,null,null,"Scottish med student here. The NHS is funded by our government, and everyone is taxed a certain amount to help pay for it, except for those under 18 or currently in full-time education. The NHS is publicly funded completely through tax. There isn't a specific ""NHS tax"", it's just taken out of the income tax each person pays. Tax is banded according to your income such that the rich pay a larger percentage of their income towards tax, and the poor pay less. My family was making £27k last year, and about 3.5k of that went to tax (if my figures are correct, I'm not sure).  

The NHS is the biggest employer in the UK, and doctors still do get paid a hefty sum, I assume this is what you mean by attraction? The thing that is driving doctors away from their specialties isn't things like lack of pay, or too many hours. It's a ridiculous pressure to meet government targets as opposed to optimising patient care - they get frustrated that the government don't let them take care of their patients properly.

The government are the ones who decide how much the NHS gets funded, and there's a lot of stuff going around about health care reforms, budget cuts and privatisation of the NHS (all of which have been heavily protested against). Why these changes are coming in is simply because the politicians in charge of the NHS have no clue what it's like on the ground. They don't know what it's like for the doctors, or the patients, or nurses, or janitors or assistants. A lot of the problems within the NHS come not from it being too expensive to fund, but from the government wasting money, putting the money into schemes that won't work, misallocating the money, introducing absurd levels of micro-management and just a general misunderstanding of what's actually going on inside a hospital. The British Medical Association have had their advice to the government ignored too many times, the politicians are opting for things that are 'vote-friendly', i.e. they sound good on paper, so they'll get votes, but they don't work in practice. And it's only AFTER they've gained power they start doing things we don't like.

An example of this is the ""4-hour rule"". If someone gets taken to A&amp;E, the department has to either have them admitted to hospital or discharged within 4 hours. Voters think this is great. ""Yay! I won't have to spend ages waiting in A&amp;E now!""
The thing is, doctors weren't taking a long time to see you because they sit on their arses. A&amp;E doctors work very hard and they need a lot of time to make sure they're giving people the best possible care, this 4 hour rule just ends up with people getting admitted to medical wards needlessly, fiddling of figures (saying a patient was admitted in 3 hours 59 minutes when it was actually 5 hours), stressing out doctors, beds being taken up and ultimately patient care is compromised because instead of giving the gold standard of care, they have to give patients the bronze standard to meet targets. 

Almost all of the Royal Colleges (every doctor in the UK who reaches consultancy, this is the position equivalent to an attending in the US, is a member of a Royal College for their field. i.e. Royal College of GPs, Royal College of Physicians, Royal College of Anaesthetists) have fought against NHS privatisation and PFI schemes. The BMA have spoken out against it, and so has the General Medical Council (these are the guys who make sure doctors follow certain ethics and laws, and make sure that they get the training that they need, they give you your license to practice medicine).

If the government wants to keep the NHS running smoothly, they need to start listening to the professionals that actually work in it, instead of wasting money and making things harder for people.

Edit: Quick aside, the NHS in Scotland isn't being privatised. Just in England (I don't know about the situation in Wales and NI). Scotland as a devolved government has control over its healthcare independent of England. Hence why us Scots get our prescriptions for free, but the English don't. Our two governments allocate money differently. If the Scots are spending more money on health care, and still keeping things running smoothly, that tells me that the problem isn't funding, but allocation of that funding.

Edit 2: Ghwyr has made a great contribution below me. Although I'm not sure that NI contributions go towards health care (I don't think they do), but I forgot about the profit made from facilities and equipment used by private companies.

Judging by this statement, I don't think you understand European countries much better. For one thing, Europe is a collection of sovereign nations, and shouldn't be referred to as a uniform place; for an example, the difference between the far north and the far south is significant in both culture and public conduct. Granted, more europeans should understand that USA is a collection of different states, with comparable differences (to a smaller degree) between some of them.

I should probably do a rant on these mentioned ""freedoms of a daily basis"" (by all means, elaborate), but I think I'll just link retarded, tangentially related metrics and call it a day.

My monthly living costs were -

* Gym - £10 (50% subsidised via work)

And that's it. I cycled everywhere, cooked food in bulk and froze it. No debts other than student loan, which doesn't get taken until you're on 21k+. And I didn't drink at the time due to a health problem.

That left me approximate £700 a month disposable income. Which is loads. I saved for months until I had a decent emergency fund. I blew some on gadgets, eating out, and could afford to go on holiday once a year.

true,Sleww,lfc68,,"**Jonjo Shelvey** - Shelvers was fantastic in the first two games. His form dropped a bit against Spurs but I attribute that to the fact that it was a million degrees outside (believe me, I was there) and he’s not used to that much heat, not to mention he played 3 games in 8 days. He truly was the best player on the pitch against Roma. He also looks to have added a bit of muscle in the past couple months, making it easier for him to defend against eh big bodies in the EPL. He almost always gives 100% when he’s on the pitch. He may not run as much as Hendo, but he sure isn’t afraid to go for a hard challenge, even in pre-season. I wouldn’t be surprised if he is BR’s first option off the bench for the midfield. He really seems to have improved quite a lot.

**Suso** - He looked pretty good on this tour. He was comfortable with the ball at his feet and looked to make the right pass. The problem for me is that he almost always kept the ball for too long. Also, he was a bit selfish in the final third. Instead of passing it, he sometimes tried to take on three defenders at the same time. That will come with experience. He may need to be loaned out to a Championship club. Also, he needs quite a bit of work on his right foot. You can’t boss the midfield in the EPL with only one foot.

**Raheem Sterling** - He was a bright spot for us throughout the tour. He was full of energy and was always running. It’s nice to see someone give 100% all the time, but that could be because he’s still 17. He needs a bit of time to mature still. His crosses are a liability. He can beat as many players as he wants out on the wing, but if he doesn’t know how to cross the ball, it’s not helpful at all. He’s an option off the bench for us because we don’t have much depth at winger, but I think he needs to be loaned out.

**Lucas Leiva** - It was great to see him in action again. It took him two games to find his feet on the pitch. He was back to making his usual boss-like challenges against Spurs. Hopefully, he’ll stay healthy this season. He still needs to work a bit on adjusting to BR’s system. He is good at long passes, but I’d rather he keep with the system and set up chances through short passing.

**Steven Gerrard** - Well, we only saw 30 minutes of him on the whole tour. Still, it was nice to see him out there again. When he comes onto the pitch, the attitudes of the other players on the pitch instantly changes. He is still their inspiration, and it really is great to see. In thirty minutes, there were far too many “hero” balls attempted. I know he likes those, that’s just who he is as a footballer, but he needs to slow the game down and go for the short, easy pass to move upfield like BR wants. I know he can play that role because he showed it at the Euro’s where he was one of the best players in the tournament. He may not play as much this year as he has in the past, but I hope he stays healthy and no injuries. He’s slowly regaining his pre-injury form.

**Stewart Downing** - We didn’t see him for much (just 45 minutes) but I really liked the energy out of him. It was hot that day, but it didn’t really stop him from running the whole time. He also put in a couple dangerous crosses. He has the ability to beat defenders, but doesn’t always have the confidence to do so. Hopefully, there will be less pressure on him this year and he can perform well.

**Fabio Borini** - Again, we only saw about 30 minutes out of him. He had a couple good plays and a couple bad ones. He looked a bit too unselfish at times. Sometimes, he just needs to pull the trigger. He also gave the ball away far too easily a couple times. I think he’s just trying to shake off the rust since he hasn’t played competitively in far too long.

**Joe Cole** - I think Joe gets too much criticism from /r/Liverpoolfc. I honestly think he was one of our better players through the tour. He had a terrible set piece in the TFC match, but I think he was the second best player on the pitch in the Roma game. He didn’t shine as much against Spurs but I think that’s because he had the handicap of Enrique on his half of the field. He had a great amount of energy and always at least attempted to run the ball down. He set up a good amount of scoring opportunities as well. I don’t know if he’s fit enough to play that position in every game so we’ll see what happens with that, but I think he should find a place in the team. It seems like he actually *wants* to be here. He’s looking for a chance to prove himself.

**Jordan Henderson** - He only played 45 minutes on the tour but I think he was brilliant. He is always running. He’s so incredibly fit. Not many people know remember this, but he played 37 out of 38 EPL games last season. He gives 100% on the pitch, and I feel like he does that in training as well. We all know how technically gifted he is (keepy ups, crossbar challenge). I feel like he just needs that little bit of confidence to be a prominent player in the EPL. Against Spurs, he looked promising going forward and even defending. He almost always picked the perfect pass. He’s very good at switching the play to the other side of the field, something a central midfielder needs to be able to do. I think, if given the playing time, he can slot into the Xavi-like role for us.

**Strikers**

**Nathan Eccleston** - I feel like we’ve been waiting for him to break through for far too long. Again, he seemed to make little or no impact on the tour. He had a couple good turns but often rushed the shot. I don’t remember him bothering the keeper with any of his shots. He’s quite old now for a youth player and is hardly the type of player we need in the squad. It may be time to sell him at this point.

**Adam Morgan** - Morgan showed quite a bit of promise on the tour. I really like how he was always on the shoulder of the last defender. Sure, he got called offside quite a bit, but he also kept the whole defense honest. I think he has a promising future if he continues to work hard.

**Andy Carroll** - We didn’t see that much of him so there’s not much to say. He had a couple bad giveaways but also showed some technical skill. He’s comfortable coming back to defend as well. He seems to show the desire to want to stay here and earn his spot on the team. I just wonder if BR will take the risk of going the whole season with only him and Borini as true strikers.

A couple things:

-	Thanks for everyone who came to the match in Baltimore. It was hot, but it was so incredibly worth it to see the Reds in person (my LFC first game – all the way from Iowa). I had a blast and so did my family. I was in section 141 and can’t think of a better way to represent the Reds. We were loud the whole time. I think the players were even surprised by the amount of support that was there.

-	I may consider doing this more often if you guys enjoy it. Let me know if you want me to continue. I’m thinking every week or so would be the easiest for me, once a month would take way too long to type up. If you don’t like it, that’s okay as well. Let me know please. Thanks!

Again I don't know where you get your assumptions for life in the U.S., but it seems extremely incorrect, it's not some violent cesspool where everyone fears for their lives and owns guns to kill baddies.

Your statement is entirely based on the use of a gun for self defense, which is simply one of the many uses of guns.

Most people don't own guns exclusively for defense. But they are allowed to have all kinds of guns.

We don't assume everyone else has a gun, that is silly. We do enjoy the right to own any gun we want. 

No one in this country needs to own a gun. But we are certainly allowed to. The survey shows that 2/3rds of Americans are perfectly happy not owning guns. But they can't stop the other 3rd from owning one.

true,[deleted],null,null,"American living in Boston, MA here.  You don't need to own a gun in this country, not realistically anyway.  It's fairly well recognized by most that accidents due to guns far outnumber the amount of violent gun crimes in the US so the safety angle is kind of bogus.  However, a gun owner will likely tell you that they are more careful than the average person and they can make their own home safe where as they cannot make the ""world"" safe. This might certainly be true of a specific gun owner (personal variance), but on the whole more people get shot accidentally at home than in shootouts or anything like that. Obviously it is a fact that the U.S. is one of the most (or the most) violent western industrial nation, but the actual presence of violence is played up severely by our media which inflates people's perception of violence frequency.  In reality you are more likely to be beaten by your spouse than injured by a gun as well, but people have far more fear of the unknown hoodlum in the back alley that they will likely never meet.  It is a very big problem with our media and it unfortunately does contribute to gun ownership as well (times of media uncertainty increase ownership).

You are definitely on to something with the notion that people are more likely to own guns if the people around them are owners, but more often the reason is ""gun acceptance"" not fear.  By owning a gun you become ""part of the club"" of gun owners.  It is a unique American fraternity.  An example is the higher incidence of gun ownership in rural areas (hunting, target shooting ect..) compared with urban areas when you are more likely to be a victim of violent crime in the city (obviously still a very small possibility of course).  Part of this is due to regulation, but most cities (including Boston which is a strict one comparatively) it is not difficult at all to legally purchase and firearms.  

I'm really split on the whole issue.  I don't think I'll ever own a gun personally because although I know I'm a very cautious person, I can never guarantee my weapon could not be used or accidentally hurt the people I love.  If I want to shoot a gun I can rent one at the firing range and they can hold on to it, I have no need for it at home.",0,1343674688,null,0,false,0,c5lo3oj,t3_xcf85,t1_c5lo3oj,t1_c5ln9qm,null,1429508991,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,Ghwyr,hampshire,Hampshire,"Funding for the the NHS comes from 4 main sources, the first two are the most relevant...

1. National Insurance Contributions. Similair to taxes, everyone pays a percentage of their earnings in NI contributions and that money goes on the welfare system including the NHS. That money cannot be used for anything other than health and welfare services 

2. Taxes. In addition to the NI as the NHS is funded on an ""as needed"" basis any shortfall in funding or investment in infrastucture etc is paid via the general taxes.

Its worth pointing out at this point that the average uk Tax and NI burdon is still less than what the average US citizen pays in taxes.

3. Charitable foundations and donations.

4. Private healthcare. Yes we have private healthcare as well for those that want (and can afford) to pay for it, and if those private healthcare providors use or share any resource owned or operated by the NHS then the NHS charges them and uses the profits for the NHS in general. So even our private healthcare funds the NHS.

So in short yes *everybody* pays for it as a percentage of their earnings.

As for attracting high quality professionals, the NHS does pay well. Not as much as some countries but it does pay well. It does however provide a very high quality of training and up until fairly recently Doctors and Nurses recieved free training and education (paid for by our taxes) so for many the ideals upon which it is founded and operates are as important if not more important than the financial incentive.",0,1343674911,null,0,false,0,c5lo5wt,t3_xcf85,t1_c5lo5wt,t1_c5lmq1f,null,1429509020,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

When I was fifteen years old I was riding my bicycle the four miles to school when I was hit by a car driven by a seventeen year old friend of mine.  My single parent family was poor, and at the time my mother was unemployed.

I broke both wrists and one knee, had a fractured skull and massive facial injuries.  I was in hospital for six weeks and in and out of hospital for many months.  I don't remember 1995 at all.  I had bone grafts and plastic surgery to reattach and reconstruct the right hand side of my face, and to reconstruct the orbit of my right eye.

My right knee was missing some significant tissue, particularly the system of ligaments that holds it together, and I didn't have adequate tissue for grafts, so a specialist surgeon was flown in from Northern Ireland-  where they have a specialty in dealing with trauma-  and a set of ligaments were constructed out of dacron fabric.

Meanwhile my right wrist had collapsed so badly that my hand was not getting adequate blood flow.  A specialist surgeon was flown in from London, and stents were placed in the veins there to improve matters.  I kept my hand.

My cranial nerves were severed on that side of my face that was evulsed from my skull, so another specialist was called in to repair them as best she could.  The surgery was groundbreaking and successful; nerve grafts are finicky things and two of three succeeded.

I suffered major swelling in my brain-  that's why I don't remember 1995 very well-  and so I was taken to one of the first MRI facilities in Europe-  and one of the first in the world-  to have high resolution MRI scans made of my head.  MRI, for reference, was invented in the UK, with NHS funding, at Nottingham University.

At the end of it all, the NHS added up the costs.  They were more than a half a million Pounds Sterling.  

I paid zero.

I never had to wait for any of this treatment.  Most people now-  nearly twenty years later- say they don't notice my scars.  The surgeons did a really good job.  I certainly have no neurological deficit, though I could do with a replacement knee.

I had more than five years of physical therapy to regain the use of my hands and to be able to walk again.  All gratis.

If I'd been in the USA, I seriously doubt my outcome would have been nearly as positive.

And that's why I start to twitch and get stabby every time someone disses the NHS.",0,1343675194,null,0,1343675387,0,c5lo8o5,t3_xcf85,t1_c5lo8o5,t1_c5lb34z,null,1429509058,109,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,109

I live in one of the poor parts of the country, my village has a population of a couple thousand, and is a former miner's village. There's a health centre here with a lot of GPs (family doctors) working there and they are top quality doctors. If you need to go A&amp;E, an ambulance will be out, and drive you to the nearest hospital in the next town over in (at most) 15 minutes. My GP has never given me anything less than the best care, and I've never heard anyone I know complain about any of the GPs in the centre. They certainly aren't scarce for money, either.

We do get pissed at people who don't take care of themselves. I read a figure in BBC news and in the Guardian that the NHS spent billions to treat obesity and its complications. Some people think the NHS shouldn't pay for treatment of obesity-caused illness.
Our A&amp;Es are often burdened by people who've had bad experiences with drugs, or have drank too much alcohol. A lot of valuable money gets spent to treat these guys, and people get annoyed that their tax money ends up paying for their treatment because they were too stupid to stop drinking. A&amp;E staff and tax payers alike get annoyed at them. Like the obese, there are some people who think that the NHS shouldn't pay to treat alcohol-induced injuries. 
I'm of the position that more should be done to discourage and prevent these issues, but treatment should still be available when it arises. I'm not comfortable with the idea that an obese person (who may very well be obese because they're too poor to afford healthy food and resort to microwave and fast food) who develops type 2 diabetes wouldn't have the money for treatment and may end up blind, or losing a limb.

I wouldn't say it creates incentives to not stay healthy, look at the obesity rates: Health care in America is absolutely extortionate, but a higher percentage of the population is obese than in the UK. Scotland has a problem with heart disease, but that's because our culture has a fatty diet. England doesn't have the same problem with heart disease, and they also have free health care, so we can discount free health care as a factor.",0,1343675662,null,0,1343680066,0,c5lodcp,t3_xcf85,t1_c5lodcp,t1_c5lnymx,null,1429509117,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I live in Manchester city centre so my rent is quite high (around the £500 pcm mark) but for what extra I may pay because I live where I do I save in travel costs with everything being pretty much on my doorstep including my place of work.

My freezer is usually full of various meat, bought when it's cheap, if I wanted to I could probably live healthily for about 2-3 weeks just off the contents of my freezer.

As for utilities and bills, my most expensive one is the council tax obviously (which helps pay for street maintenance and other council services). 

I pay my electric and water (no gas in this flat) by Direct Debit so I can be pretty liberal with what I use and I only see a £10 a month increase usually over winter. 

It's actually pretty cheap to live off anything between £17k and £20k a year I'd say. 

You won't be wearing designer gear (like someone said, Primark, F&amp;F at Tesco or George or great for cheap, good quality clothes that don't like shit) or having 2 holidays a year or even eating fillet steak but you will be able to survive and live quite happily.

true,sammo62,null,null,"I live in the US and used to live in the UK up until December - here are my thoughts:

* People in the UK travel more, not less, but it is much cheaper thanks to cheap package holidays and low cost airlines.

* Are student loan repayments are much lower - mine is 9% of everything I earn over £15k, my wife's $30k loan has 8% interest on it!

* I cycled everywhere and would never have dreamed of buying a brand new car on finance in the UK.

* Food is actually pretty comparable.

* A lot of people in the UK are asset rich thanks to getting in on the house price ~~scam~~ boom at the right time. 

* People in the UK buy less luxuries in general.

* Universal healthcare

* Relatively low taxes for those on minimum wages thanks to tax free allowance that you don't get in the USA

* People do live with their parents longer. I waited until I was 24 to move out so I had a nice nest egg which meant I could pay for my wedding and the cost of moving country without accruing any debts. 

* The recent exchange rate changes have clouded your views slightly. In 2007 when the ratio was £1 to $2 a salary of £25k compared pretty nicely. Nowadays earning $50k in the US feels a ton more than £25k in the UK. 

* In the UK houses tend to act as our long term savings accounts more than in the US. A 3 bedroom semi-detached house in my old hometown of Cambridge would average about $500k, whereas I can get a 6 bedroom, double garage, McMansion for that here in the Midwest.

Note sure what he means by the banks were too big to fail and he wasn't lucky because he didn't get bailed out he was trading on margin's with Contracts for difference.


If your not sure what that means it is when you buy shares but only are required to pay for a deposit. So if you have a margin on 50:1 which they were at the time you put down 100k you are really liable 5million.


When the share price then went from £20 to £1 he was asked to settle which is part of the contract. With the fictional numbers above you would turn the 5million in shares into 250k which is a loose of 4.75m. The only difference is he did it with much bigger sums and ended up owning massive amounts. I think I remember reading he ended up owning most of the bank at one stage.


When it went south he was asked to settle. This obviously made him bankrupt since he didn't have the funds to settle the contract. So of course if you become bankrupt in this way somebody will take control of your asserts and sell them on to recover as much money as they can to settle the depts. Instead of obeying the rules the money was then moved / stolen  and passed into foreign countries in an attempt to hide it. This was in breach of court orders and various other laws.


He was caught attempting to do the above with his trousers at his ankles and should see some serious jail time. Probably for numerous charges of fraud, theft, laundering money etc.. I know one thing for certain is that if the average Joe did anything remotely like this ""Joe"" would see considerable jail time.

&gt; I don't know why for sure, but Europeans favor being free ""from"" things, whereas Americans value being free to ""do"" things.

There's definitely something to that. The US has a much more freewheeling culture (overall: we have our free-spirited enclaves just as the US has its uptight middle-class suburban types). I've always preferred to look at the results in practice than in theory, though, and I don't think the differences are that big, where there are any. It's only at the edges that there's much real difference. And then it's six of one and half a dozen of the other. You can say what you want in public, we can drink booze in the park.

&gt; We are very much a nation of 50 semi-autonomous states that ALLOW the Federal entity to exist, whereas in Europe I noticed the Federal government seems to be the end all-be all

Yes and no. Most European countries are about the size of US states, so having another layer of government under that would be excessive. But of course we have the EU over us, which also exists through the tolerance of its member governments. It's not as accountable as your federal government, though, which has its upsides as well as downsides (see the recent ACTA vote—the EU very much has a fuck-you attitude to external pressure, and is notably immune to the lobbying of rich companies.)

&gt; I do know which way I prefer, and it's the American system.

That's hardly surprising. You were raised with it and your fundamental assumptions are in line with its.

I am not sure about this. If you are going into a scheme in the civil service, police, nhs, even M&amp;S then you will probably get 22-26K (in London at least). In finance or law, this can go to as high as 40K or so if you are in the elite roles (like trading or corp finance). The issue of the state support is key: if you take 3K a year to pay for insurance and 2K for uni repayments, that adds up fast. Also, a lot of people (and lots in the US) are essentially living beyond their means, buying TVs, handbags or cars with credit cards. Lots of people have a huge mortgage and 10K in credit card debt. Those ads on TV for sofas where you pay nothing for 1 year are what lead to people having a seemingly expensive lifestyle, built on debt. In that sense you are right, lots of people can't afford an iPhone or whatever, but they buy it anyway and pay £25 a month for 10 years. 

I would also add something: the 'baby boomer' generation born 45-70 or so have done very well, with state spending, rising house prices, a mostly good economy. My generation (born 85-2000) are getting screwed over badly with massive uni costs, housing we cannot afford, no pensions, no jobs etc. Perhaps we appear wealthy, but we are mostly living with our parents and can expect min wage jobs or internships for some years.",0,1343678024,null,0,false,0,c5lp0a7,t3_xef41,t1_c5lp0a7,t1_c5lopyq,null,1429509417,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

http://www.humanevents.com/2009/05/14/whats-so-bad-about-universal-health-care/


Here is another based on the concept of ""we dont have the right to expect another to pay for our health care"", completely ignoring the fact that we will be paying for OUR OWN health care, financing it throughout our lives.  

http://www.debatepolitics.com/blogs/mrvicchio/224-why-universal-healthcare-wrong-discussion-my-liberal-progressive-friends.html


Most of the arguments are based on this assumption- that ""liberals"" want someone else to pay for our health care.  This is not true.  Conservatives also claim that universal health care will increase our deficit and overall health care spending, which is also not true.  As we stand, we are funding DOZENS of health care administrations, each with its own little niche.  For example, we have a healthcare admin for veterans, one in each state for people who get sick or hurt on the job, hundreds of individual for-profit management companies, hundreds of individual for-profit hospitals, plus hundreds if not thousands of community hospitals and hospital systems, plus medicare, medi-cal, and I dont know how many other state administrations as well.  As we stand, of all this money we spend, less than %60 actually goes to health care.   And we still fund treatment for the poor- they have to wait until they are on the verge of death, then go to the Emergency Room.  Last time I had to take a midnight trip to the ER, it was packed full of hispanic non-english speakers with sick children.  Every one of those visits could have been prevented much more cheaply by providing care before the ear infection or cold went systemic.   

Also neglected in these arguments is an acceptance of our natural life cycle.  We are dependent for a while, then healthy and working for a while, then less healthy and working for a while, then elderly and not working for a while, then we die. The only way to make a system sustainable is if we fund enough healthcare for our entire lives during the time we are healthy. This would take quite a hefty tax hike- but is still cheaper than paying for-profit rates as we go.  Who, for example, can make enough to cover ALL possible expenses for the future?  Better to pool funds, so that we are all covered, and some will need less care, some will need more, but there is no way to tell who is who beforehand.  

Another argument is that people who are health-concious, who make sacrifices to stay healthy, will be paying for people who smoke, who eat junk food, etc.   I agree this would bug me too, but there is no reason why we cannot adjust rates based on CONTROLLABLE and preventable risk factors. Why not a health-care tax on things that are purely unhealthy, such as tobacco and fried food and air pollutants and water pollutants?   Why not pay for the whole cost of using these things up-front, instead of forcing everyone else to pay for the effects such as cancer, diabetes and obesity?    But these are things that American conservative politicians will not consider, because they are being funded by these very same corporations!

The biggest argument against universal healthcare is the assumption that having government run things inherently makes them somehow worse.  The evidence says otherwise.   Naturally, ANY big organization will have beaurocracy, red tape, and a fair bit of bullshit.  This is as true of large governments as it is of big corporations.  Thus far, everything we have privatized has gotten worse.  Independent think-tanks have calculated that removing the for-profit aspect of health care would save a lot of money over time.  

The biggest reason that americans dislike the NHS is because we believe what we see, and most of what we see is controlled by companies with a vested interest in us feeling a certain way about certain things.  For example, the health care industry pretended to be supportive of the Affordable Health Care Act, while at the same time spending a hundred million dollars on smear ads under innocuous names.

1.  The united states tax payer spends more money than any other country on healthcare, in a way they are more socialized then anyone else and as such doesn't necessarily represent the opposite of European or canadian models.

2.  Private health care will always provide better service (for those who can afford it) than public money.  As far as I know the government has never done anything more efficiently or in with better quality than a private enterprise.

3.  I can't speak for other countries, but in Canada the wait times are long and people do die waiting for operations.  It can take six months to get an MRI.  Even the supreme court of canada has ruled that the quebec government has violated peoples rights by forcing people to be on wait lists and not allowing them to pay out of their own pockets for healthcare.

4.  Socialized medicine is not a one-tier system in canada as much as the politicians would like you the believe.  Rich to moderately wealthy people can easily go to the united states to receive care in a tiny fraction of the time.  Not to mention that I never see a hockey player waiting in line for MRIs.  Also, if you know the doctor you can probably get seen first.  The poor people get worse care than the rich, but it is most surely not as bad as the US.

5.  The Ontario budget for healthcare is coming up on 45% and rising.  Socialized medicine has been successful due to the demographics of when they were introduced.  Large number of baby boomers in the 60s and 70s allowed for a large tax base to pay for old people.  We do not have these demographics anymore, and as a result healthcare costs in most provinces in canada are unsustainable in the next 20 years.

true,amightypirate,null,null,"I think what my fellow Brits are forgetting is that yours is still a young country. We have had a form of parliament since about 1000 AD whereas your first settlers arrived in America in the 1600s and only really established a congress when your people elected George Washington as your president in 1789 and the country was huge! No wonder each state and county has so much power; your congress would have to be the population of the UK to get everything done. The combination of being small and experienced allows the British government (though I don't particularly like the current system) to establish country wide law fairly quickly, expecting the police and judicial system to uphold it. City councils (which seems to be the equivalent of your county jurisdictions (municipality? if not what the frig are they?)) only hold power on the minutiae of how their city is run with rubbish disposal, educational standards and so on.

Some of this topic is nonsense. The NHS does not ""just exist"" it was established relatively recently by a health secretary of the government as a floor under which no citizen can fall. Owf says ""Brits don't pay health insurance premiums"" to which I ask what he or she thinks ""national insurance"" is? I think that is the important point; in the US even if you have health insurance it costs you (as I understand it can still cost a couple of hundred dollars to claim on the insurance) to be ill or injured. If you are ill or injured your ability to earn money is lessened, and your ability to pay for insurance to look after yourself is lessened. Which is a dangerous dependency. You need to be well to have money and you need to have money to stay well. Which is great if you have money, but if by bad luck or bad choices that cycle broke then you're up shit creek financially and perhaps mortally. If you're unlucky or stupid there is no maximum amount that you can be fucked over; you can be dead and bankrupt. The minimum conditions that the government offers you in terms of your health are not the same as the minimum you would want and sometimes nobody will look after you while you are your most vulnerable. Which is surely the reason we form society? The NHS offers us a certainty that we will be looked after no matter what dire straights we end up in for whatever reasons. I sometimes wonder to myself what fraction of my salary would I pay to ensure that one complete stranger stayed healthy forever.

At the end of the day the NHS is expensive, but the security it provides is completely and utterly worth every penny. Of course, I would like to be taxed less and still receive the same luxury, but tough fucking titties. For me the best thing is if you came over here for a visit and (noodle forgive) broke any bone, whether it was your fault or someone else's fault they would patch you up, free of any charge (except for £7.20 should they prescribe you some medication to take home) and let you continue on your way.

I had to take out a loan for ~$69,000 for my first year of school (approximately £43,969).  This includes about $49,000 for first-year tuition with the remainder for room and board.  Sum total for all four years will be over $200,000 on top of the $17,000 I had to loan for my Bachelor's degree. Post graduation I will be $217,000 (£138,278) in debt, yet as an intern (first year post graduation) I will likely only have an income of $50,000 to $70,000 the first year.  These figures are standard for private universities.  State-sponsored universities are slightly less expensive, but also incredibly difficult to be accepted to.

This level of debt is causing a national Primary Care deficit, with most doctors choosing more specialized practices over family care or general practice.  It is also far more appealing to join a medical group or insurance sponsored hospital like Kaiser Permanente.  As a private GP a doctor would also be responsible for renting his office, hiring a staff, organizing agreements with insurance companies, setting prices and somehow still see patients.  With Kaiser or similar groups, a doctor merely has to show up, see patients and get paid.  Los Angeles County Hospitals are run in a similar fashion and are the closest thing I've seen in California to a social healthcare program.  All patients seen in an LA County Hospital are provided care regardless of ability to pay, and it is amazing.

To try and give you an idea, here's a break down from my money management program for June 2011 -&gt; June 2012.

Shared ""Income"":  
£16k - Split from our separate accounts, £8k her, £8k me.  


Shared Expense:  
Rent: £7,800 @ £650/month for a three bed large terrace house.  
Gas: £885  
Electricity: £1,050 (Tech... it consumes power... who knew?)  
Water: £320  
Council Tax: £1,200  
Internet: £450 (Expensive FTTC Internet)  
Telephone: £180 (Can't tell BT to sod off :( )  
Pets: £300 (Only Critters, no dogs or cats)  
Groceries: £2,300 (All shopping, make your own food, don't buy ready shite)  
Eating Out: £120 (We don't often, and usually it's a treat for the other person, so rarely out of joint)  
Take Out: £140 (Once a month-ish)  
TV: £300 (Sky + TV License, some missing from this, not sure where)  
Random Cash: £250 (Likely Groceries)  
House Insurance: £150  
Overdraft Fee's: £125 (I knew how much was in there... she didn't. ;)  

Me Income:  
~£40k before tax... £26k after. £2k of Student Loan leaves with the tax too.  

Me Expense:  
Personal Loan Payback: £5,000 (student years were stupid, now some years later)  
Shared ""Income"": £8,000  
Car, Gas: £1,000 (only pootling to and from work, around town)  
Car, Tax: £333 (Think I brought 18 months of tax this past 12 months)  
Car, Service: £400  
Hobbies, Computing: £3300 (PC bits, iPad, Internet Servers, etc)  
Hobbies, WoW: £211  
Hobbies, Electronics: £300 (bits, PCB production, etc.)  
Credit Card Repayments: £2,300 (always pay it off on bill date, but stuff isn't' categorised, half hobbies, half   
recreation)  
Misc, Cash: £800  
Misc, Union Fee's: £240  
Misc, PayPal: £1,100 (like the CC, uncategorised)  
Travel/Recreation: £100  
Saving: £2,000  

£25k out of £26k... the rest is other misc categories that were too small to bother with.

I couldn't live my current life style on my own sure... not with my personal loan, but without that and a lower Rent I could cover that gap and still do all the things I enjoy doing. Expense is like shit, it always expands to fill volume available.

18-24 months ago I didn't have any money management software... making some was the best thing I could ever do. Just looking at your balance every week or so doesn't tell you jack about what's going on. I can see for months in advance when I'm expecting stuff to come out. I know how much spare I'll have at the end of the month and how much I can save. I can plan for larger expenditure now... months ahead of it happening... rather then just that nag in the back of your mind of something looming.

Not sure this will have actually helped you understand the issue now I've typed it all out, but damn'd if I'm going to just throw it away now.

**JSA**: If you've basically paid enough contributions over the last tax year, you're entitled to contribution based JSA - doesn't matter if you worked minimum wage, or if you were earning Premier league salary, everyone who has ""paid into the system"" gets Contribution based JSA.

After six months your entitlement to this form of JSA ends - at that point you can apply for Income based JSA. This form of welfare is ""means tested"" - in other words, it isn't automatic that you'll get it. If your partner [if applicable] earns above a certain amount, for example, that can preclude you from getting income based JSA. If you've got around £16K in savings, that would also prevent you from getting income based JSA.

Hopefully you won't have to worry too much about income based JSA - but if you're still unemployed in six months time, apply for it anyway - if you can prove you have no other income, and you don't live with anyone who can ""keep you"", then you might get it.

**Housing Benefit / LHA:** Get all your paperwork together - rental agreement, bank statements / building society book, proof of JSA / proof you've applied for JSA. Then pop down to your local council housing office and ask for a Housing benefit form / council tax form. Bring it back home, fill it in and take all the paperwork &amp; forms back in, and ask if they have a ""fast track service"" - this usually means your application will be processed within a set time, typically three / five working days.

I used to do landscaping for a self-made millionaire who traveled quite frequently.  He was in good shape for an elderly man but he ended up getting an infection in his knee while he was in London and when he went to the doctor to check it out, the doctor asked if he had health insurance back in the States- which he did.  The doctor's recommendation was for him to fly back home and have it checked out.

I believe the doc recommended this because he could get better treatment here, or maybe it would have been faster, I'm not sure on the details of this.

* Every British citizen pays (according to 2011) approximately 1,966 pounds / ~$3088 US dollars per year for your health service in taxes. [source](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2011-02-15a.40405.h)  
This past year, I am a healthy young male with asthma and allergies, and my insurance cost (split 50% with employer) High Deductible was ~380 for the fee. Now everytime I go to the doctor, I pay full price until I hit my deductible. ($2000). After that, I pay nothing. I would say I have ""decent"" health insurance through Humana. If I don't see any doctors in the year, my total cost would be $380. My maximum out of pocket is $3000. So absolutely maximum for the year for me would be $3380. My employer also gives me 1k in the year (incentive for choosing High-deductible plan). I - worst case - pay total 2380, if I max out my costs.  
  
The US system is broken as shit (pre-existing conditions, prereqs for getting rates, etc.), and it still costs me almost the same (if I practically die) as your system per taxpayer (even if you never visit the doctor). And you're telling me that I can't call your system bloated?

The U.S. has some significant challenges for universal healthcare. With some exemptions most countries do not recognize medications as patent-able.  This is not true with the U.S., we allow patenting chemical structures. The repercussions of this is the US funds nearly the entire R&amp;D budgets for the world with respect to medicine.  It also sky-rockets our health care costs.  Its not atypical to find a prescription that will cost you 10 USD in Canada to cost over 300 USD in the US.  Drug manufacturers have difficulties selling drugs when faced with so much generic competitions that can compete within a month of FDA/EMA clearance.  I should note how the drug is created can still be patented internationally, but only if its novel or unique.

So while other countries enjoy low, low costs for medicine the US effectively subsidizes free healthcare.  I don't know if US citizens realize its a major hurdle to getting universal healthcare.

Showing all the symptoms of meningitis, I was driven to the nearest A&amp;E by my family. They had me in a bed and on intravenous medication in under fifteen minutes.

They took the decision that it was too risky to wait on specific test results and threw as much medication at me as they had, to cover all possibilities. Turns out I did have meningitis, bacterial no less, and was, at time of admission, mere hours from death.

The doctors were thorough and the nurses were fantastic. Once well enough, I was fed as much food as I could eat and was given as much juice, tea, coffee as I could drink. Ten days later I walked out of the hospital alive and able to put my life back together.

MRI scans revealed I had an arachnoid cyst and the meningitis affected my eyesight so I received thorough follow-up care for all that too.

All they needed from me was my name and address. No money, no insurance details, no signatures, nothing. 

I owe the NHS my life, and I also owe them nothing. Had I been billed for the costs at this stage in my life, much of it would now have to be spent trying to pay it back. People call that *freedom?* Get civilised.

I've posted about this about 100 times, but it never seems to get anywhere.

NHS covers 80% of the problems, 100% of the time.

Just as many people fall through the holes in NHS as fall through in the american system - you read about it in the british papers nearly every day.  The difference is, here, it doesnt matter how much money you have, everyone gets the same shitty care. 

 You read about people dying in hospitals because the nurse forgot to check on them.  About doctors who cant save patients from stab wounds because there arent enough people on call, or they lack supplies.

Personally, I despise the NHS.  The only reason I'm walking right now is because I had the nerve to tell my NHS doctor to fuck off, and £1000 in my bank account to pay for the MRI he wouldnt prescribe me (so it wasnt covered under NHS insurance).  THE BEST foot doctor in england - who is currently one of the head doctors for team GB - completely failed to notice 2 severed ligaments in my ankle.  I limped into his office, told him what happened, showed him where it hurt - he did a quick feel, and told me it was a mild sprain and to walk it off.

Again, this is supposed to be one of the best doctors in the country, who completely missed something blatantly obvious.  Had I not had the nerve and money to get an MRI, and come back into the office for a follow up, I wouldnt be able to walk right now.  I ended up in a cast for 2 months, and am still not back to 100%.

My first day, being a crazy motherfucker, i dove into a tackle head on and cracked my head open.

I was rushed to the ER - same as I would be in America

I was told it would be covered by NHS by the receptionist - better than america

Then they asked how old I was.  I told them I was 15, and my birthday was in a week.  They told me they couldnt treat me.  Because under NHS, 15 yr olds are considered ""pediatric only"" and 16 year olds ""adult only"", and they had no pediatric doctors on staff.  NOTE - I was a 200lb, 5'10"" 15 year old with a full beard, and they refused to treat me as an adult because I was a week too young.

After being turned down by that hospital, I rushed over to a pediatric hospital, and tried to repeat the process.  I got to the front desk, told them how old I was, and asked to see a doctor (all with a head wound gushing blood).  They laughed at me and told me I was too old to see a pediatric doctor - I mean cmon, I was 200lbs with a beard.

NO ONE would treat me.  I fell through the cracks.  Luckily for me, I had some very rich neighbors, who called in a favor with a doctor they knew,
 **WHO HAD TO STITCH ME UP IN HER LIVING ROOM AFTER SHE GOT OFF WORK, BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE WOULD TREAT ME**

Most people are probably somewhat familiar with the idea of [supply and demand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand).  But the thing with land is that there is a fixed supply of it.  On the graph in the link, with normal goods and services, an increase in demand will lead to some increase in price and some increase in supply.  But with land, the supply curve is perfectly vertical - regardless of the price, there is a set amount of land available - so 100% of the extra demand goes into increased price (and 100% of the falling demand goes into reduced price).  
  
Because property sits on land, property values naturally rise faster than general price inflation, so it looks like there is more reward for the risk when investing in property, so demand increases, and a positive feedback loop is created, exacerbating the boom years.  It's hardly surprising that so much money goes into speculation, but eventually it just leads to a big crash.",0,1343685018,null,0,false,0,c5lqvka,t3_xes79,t1_c5lqvka,t3_xes79,null,1429510381,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Got pink eye - took 3 NHS nurses 30 minutes to process the forms to get me eyedrops.  And then they decided that the doctor was wrong, and I shouldnt be prescribed eyedrops.  THE NURSES WORKING THE PHARMACY COUNTER DECIDED THAT.  Again, lucky me, the doctor was in the same building, so I was able to call him up, have him come down, yell at the pharmacist nurses, and get me my meds.

**ONLY IN THE NHS CAN THE FUCKING PHARMACIST TELL YOU YOUR DOCTOR IS WRONG AND REFUSE YOU MEDS**

Then theres the case of the wild shrink:

Like I said above, I moved to England at 15.  I also had ADHD.  Thus, when I moved, I needed a new doctor to prescribe me Rittalin.  To make a long story short, the doctor I got was a psychotic moron.  In 3 months, not ONCE did she prescribe me with both the right medication, and the right dosage.  My family would have to phone her office almost daily to get her to send out the right medication - which never came.  After 3 months, once we had found a new doctor (which is INCREDIBLY hard in England, because the only way to have a doctor see you is to have your GP recommend you to them), we told her that we were done, and would no longer be seeing her as our doctor.  RETROACTIVELY, she modified my reports to make me look insane, and then notified the british version of child protective services that I was a danger to my friends and family, and needed to be institutionalized.  It tooks 6 months of lawyers, shrinks, phone calls, emails, and liasing with my high school to prove I wasn't a psycho.  And in fucking britian, because of the way the NHS is structured where doctors always need to work together, and always want their system to look flawless, she became untouchable.  No one would help us go after her.  She is still, to this day, a practicing shrink, and has likely fucked up dozens more kids lives.

And this is my personal (least) favorite:

My mother has a very rare, chronic illness, that requires surgery every 10 weeks to keep in check/keep from causing her unbearable pain, seizures, and overall destroying her life.  IN ALL OF ENGLAND - there were 2 doctors qualified to treat her.  FOR BOTH DOCTORS - we booked a date for the surgery with the doctor.  We confirmed over the phone that they could and would perform it.  We showed up on the day of.  And we were told they didn't feel comfortable performing it, and that we shouldnt come back to see them again.

As I said above, the surgery is very time sensitive.  So we had to shell out THOUSANDS of pounds to book my mother on an overnight flight to new york, and bombard a new york doctor with phone calls and emails to get him to treat her the next day.  And he did.  *Because in the states, if doctors pull that shit, it ruins their reputation, and they lose business.  FREE MARKET*



Every British person just tells me I'm unlucky, and that not every doctor is like that.  NO.  I have had a grand total of TWO decent doctors in all of my time in england, and BOTH OF THEM were foreigners, educated abroad.  Your system sucks, your healthcare sucks, and its a national embarrassment that you're proud of it.

Stifflling well-intentioned criticism with the emotive pleas poisons debate, which is why we so rarely have productive discussions on the NHS in the UK.

And it needs debating.

For example, cancer survival rates on the NHS are significantly poorer than in the US and other European states [source](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/01/mps-criticise-nhs-cancer-survival). Colorectal cancer treatment rates are particular poor.

Furthermore, this claim ""will provide for me, my family and my loved ones whatever we need, whenever we need it, for as long as is needed"" is not true. The National Institute for Clinical Excellent, NICE, decides what the NHS can afford and what it cannot afford, and routinely declares life saving drugs to be unaffordable. For example, sorafenib is the best treatment for primary liver cancer. NICE has declared it too expensive, so you can not get it on the NHS.

Waiting times for routine operations are notoriously high (so the ""whenever we need it claim"" is wrong).

I could go on. 

The point is that NHS as a free-to-use service is a wonderful idea (one I vigorously support), but riddled with problems which anyone familiar with the NHS will be all too well acquainted with. 

Oh, and you might be surprised to hear that the NHS didn't build a hospital until 1963, and that Great Ormond Street Hospital was treating the children of the poor, gratis, for a century before the NHS was created. It did so by philanthropy and public subscription. And there are at least 50 other nations with comprehensive state-provided healthcare. The idea that NHS is unique is a bizarre conceit which seems impossible to correct in the UK.

Our debt is fairly high but not completely horrible compared to our GDP (about 104% of GDP).  Debt to GDP ratio is what really matters.  Ours is high but not fatally high. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_debt

Plus, our economy is still growing at the moment (albeit slowly). A country like Greece is the type of country who is really in trouble.  Their debt is 165% of GDP, and their economy is contracting like crazy, something like 7-9 percent in the last year.  They have dangerously high debt and their economy is drying out at the same time, killing their ability to repay.  That's when a country goes bankrupt.  

The US has a high debt but has plenty of ability to repay.  It's not yet dangerously high and our economy (and thus tax revenue) is still growing slowly even during this difficult time (economy grew at a 1.5% clip so far this year).",0,1343685587,null,0,false,0,c5lr0qr,t3_xcf85,t1_c5lr0qr,t1_c5lqpqd,null,1429510450,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"Having lived in the UK and dealt with the NHS I think you paint quite the rosy picture.

&gt;You'd be hard pressed to find anyone in the UK who does not know someone who works within the NHS

This right here is one reason why some Americans oppose a national healthcare system.  The government is big enough and making it bigger does not make it better.  

&gt;it is a complete “cradle to the grave” healthcare 

Related to my previous point I felt that it was rather creepy that my child was assigned her own baby healthcare visitor (I forget the real name) who would come to my house to check on the baby. Imagine a nationwide version of child protective services that checks in on you even if you are doing a fine job.

&gt;Everyday when we walk past a GP's surgery knowing that we can pop in to speak to a doctor if we need to, or pass by a chemist knowing we can get our medications if needed, or see a hospital knowing our sick and injured are being cared for we know that the NHS is there for us. 

If I was sick my GP would not see me that day and forget about going in without an appointment.  If my child was sick enough that I felt involving a doctor was necessary then I might be able to get a same day appointment but not always.  Keep in mind that while you theoretically have choice in who you have as your GP each practice has a particular boundary assigned to it and can refuse patients who do not live within that boundary.  So if like me you lived in an area with only one practice consisting of a few doctors then your choice is necessarily constricted.  The NHS tried to improve that by offering more money to doctors but that had its own problems.

The medications were cheap because I lived in Wales.  As a result I paid 10 pounds every time I filled my prescription.  If you lived in England you had to pay 15 pounds.  Why?  Because the parliament was worried about Scotland or Wales trying to leave the UK and so they gave them extra benefits like cheaper prescriptions or more money for doctors.  Imagining this on a national level in the US I could see a powerful congressman getting his state super cheap drugs at the expense of other states.  If you are going to make a system to avoid the inequities of the old system then introducing more inequities is not exactly the right prescription.

When we first moved to the UK we asked about local hospitals and everybody warned us away from the local NHS run hospitals.  If you could afford it everybody recommended the private hospitals in the area.  

Of course the worst part is that many doctors had to supplement their income by doing NHS work by day and private health care in their off times as it was more lucrative.  By making themselves less available they reduced the availability of doctors and made the waiting lists even longer.  Thus the NHS was forced to spend even more money to get doctors into the system.

As a result of the crappy care provided by the NHS it is becoming common for employers to offer private health insurance as a benefit.  That is the real point.  If the NHS was as wonderful as you say then no one would need or even desire private insurance. 

Every day in the paper there was another scandal regarding the NHS either payments or denial of care or long waiting lists making minor problems worse.  The ultimate fear of being allow to die because you have become too expensive to maintain is already a reality in the UK.  

&gt;That's why we Brits get so annoyed when you insult our NHS, and that's why you need to start showing it some fucking respect.

Your NHS sucks ass. Every day your newpapers have a new story about a problem with it.  I prefer a private company to have control over my healthcare and for the government to stay the fuck out of it.  At least I can sue the shit out of a private company.  The government just claims sovereign immunity and tells you to fuck off.

It is emblematic of the British surrender to the state that they claim the NHS is a wonderful thing.  Fuck off.  I was so very glad to come home and be part of a good health care system where hospitals don't need a ""deep cleaning"" because they have been allowed to become so fucking dirty.

Government is, more often than not, an inefficient enterprise, and a government-funded healthcare system will not be any different. Brazil has had universal healthcare since 1988, and it doesn't take very long, nor does it require a lot of intelligence, to find articles online that will show you what a complete fuck-up it is. Despite the massive tax revenue that is allocated to healthcare(with special taxation being proposed to increase that), a sizable portion of it is wasted through corruption and misuse of public funding. Hospitals are understaffed, underfunded, doctors and nurses are paid close to nothing and people literally die in the hallways because there is no care available to them, or they might have to wait years for exams or treatment. Equipment often goes to complete waste in public hospitals because the staff isn't trained for it - but you can bet that a politician somewhere made a lovely buck on the public dime. Need an ambulance? Too fucking bad, there aren't enough of them to go around in most areas (I would know - my grandfather died because of this.)

So when the idea of universal health care is brought up in the US, I cringe. You can say it won't be that badly mismanaged here, but I have my doubts. With debt soaring as high as it is, is it really the right time to do this? I don't buy it for a minute that the new healthcare law is actually going to save the country any money - sorry.

Spring 2011, I started feeling more down than usual.  I go to Indiana University, a public school, funded by tax dollars, grants, donations, and tuition.  But I'm an out of state student, so I pay triple the usual tuition.  Fine, I chose this school, my parents and my scholarships are paying for it, I can handle that.

I get so depressed it becomes difficult to leave my bed and go to school.  I get behind on my classwork, so behind that thinking about the mounting workload gives me an anxiety attack.

The next day I don't fully remember.  I was crying on and off, I saw a few different people who did their best to help, I skipped at least one class, and I went to the IU Health Center, which is okay if you want a really expensive Band-Aid between the hours of 9 and 4:30 Monday-Friday.  I attend an open group stress counseling thing around 4 in the center, and start sobbing my heart out in front of total strangers.  The group leader fetches the counselor I'd been seeing in the past few weeks, who takes me to her office and gives me a box of tissues.

I call my mom.  I call my friend Rick, who lives in the same apartment complex.  We decide I will ride the bus home and Rick will drive me to the hospital.

This takes more than an hour.  An ambulance would have cost hundreds of dollars, and my counselor expressly forbid me from being alone, as I had confessed to some suicidal thoughts.  Around 6, then, and after forcing myself to eat something, I'm at the hospital with Rick.  We wait hours.  Many hours, with me shaking and crying and generally wondering what the hell happened to my ability to control and anticipate my own emotions.

I talk to admittance.  I talk to a nurse.  Another nurse?  She wanted my insurance information, I dug up a card, called my mother.  A doctor, maybe, but not a psychiatrist.  I get checked in to the hospital finally, around 11?  Or maybe it's 1.  I was wrecked.  They say I'll talk to a psychiatrist tomorrow.  We have to strip search you, and we'll go through all your belongings.  You can't have your notebook, you might hurt someone with the spiral binding.  No, you can't keep your pencils or pens.  (I'd been told to expect some of this, and given Rick my iPod and headphones).  Go to sleep.  This is your roommate (she says she's schizophrenic, when the orderlies are gone, but I'm too exhausted to care.  It's loud in the room, but I manage to sleep).

The hospital's stress ward is a blur of strange horrors.  The machinery, even the lights, emit loud noises at all hours.  One woman with dementia drags around a tower with a monitor and a drip, and whenever she moves her arm it sets off a horrible beeping.  The orderlies stop coming after it happens twice, and the patients start resetting the monitor themselves.  A man with borderline personality disorder, who is possibly bipolar, latches on to me since I listen to him and don't try to correct him much, but have proven to be smart.

I meet more suicidal, depressed people in group therapy.  One girl was raped.  A young man was thrown out of his house and broken up with on the same day.  I don't have a reason, just brain chemistry, but I tell my story anyway.

My father has to fly up from Tennessee to come get me out of the hospital, and it's just over three days before I'm released.  I am visited by two friends, my brother (who lives nearby), and my dad.  The trial has only just begun, really: I have to withdraw from a class, and sign up for a different one, but the deadline for that's passed and everything's complicated.  Dad and I spend Friday handling all of that as best we can, and Saturday we drive home, with a friend of mine as passenger, since it's Spring Break - the only convenient thing about the whole affair.  I have a prescription for medications and I'm starting to feel a little optimistic again.

Fast forward a few weeks: the prescription is increasing my suicidal thoughts, the school psychiatrist I have an appointment with prescribed me Xanax, and I eventually withdraw from school entirely and move back in with my parents (this time, my mom flies up, I meet her at the airport).  I get counseling ($25 copay, each visit) and see a psychiatrist (same) at least once a month, at first.  My medications are changed.  The dosages increase.  I start to feel human again.

The bill comes.  I'm on my parents' insurance, but the hospital wasn't in their coverage.  It's more than a thousand dollars.

They also attempt to charge us twice.

At Kroger, with insurance, I pay $10 for a month's worth of medicine.  I spend another $25 on counseling at least once a month, and $25 on my psychiatrist - at first once a month, then every three months, and now it's been longer than that, but I'll probably see her again in a month or so.

My parents, who I love dearly and am thankful for every day, begrudge me none of this.  They pay for everything.  They even pay for me to return to school, to do all of this four hundred miles away from them.

So when you say the NHS is like family, you're absolutely right.  It's quite literally mum and dad taking excellent care of you, and don't worry about the cost, dearie, you just focus on getting well.  If it weren't for my parents, I hate to think what would have happened to me last year.  I almost certainly would have killed myself, if I ended up doing all these things - withdrawing, possibly dropping out of school, being hospitalized, needing counseling...uninsured, I wonder if they would have admitted me to the hospital at all.  Counseling would cost more than $100 a visit, psychiatry probably more than that, and so would my medications - more than $400 a month, compared to $35-60.

*tl;dr* I wish like hell we had an NHS.  If not for my parents having money and insurance and loving me even when I cost thousands of dollars to save from myself, I'd be dead.",0,1343686630,null,0,false,0,c5lra78,t3_xcf85,t1_c5lra78,t1_c5lb34z,null,1429510572,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I don't know the official symptoms doctors are taught for various injuries to make diagnosis(es?), but from what I know of the NHS - doctors are trained to provide the best *value* care possible.  Not best care.  They avoid every expense they can.  To the best of my knowlege, the fact that I had a high enough pain tolerance to limp on an ankle that was absolutely fucked rather than wheel around in a chair was the deciding factor in the whole thing - ""oh you can walk?  It can't be that bad!"".  Thats not how healthcare is supposed to work.  Doctors should be better trained than that.  I can't say for sure, because I've never had the same problem in the US, but I'd bet you another £1000 that NO doctor in the states would EVER just tell me it was a sprain and that I should walk it off after an appointment like mine, ESPECIALLY after I brought up that I'd had numerous sprained ankles before, and this felt far worse.

&gt;And as some of the Brits in this thread have said, NHS is priority based, so assuming you're dying, you're at the top of the list anyway so don't worry about it.

If you're dying of anything but cancer, you absolutely should worry about it.  Because the NHS has no idea what the fuck they're doing when it comes to any kind of 'creative' care. 

 In america, doctors look at the symptoms a patient has.  They compare it to what they were taught in med school, and do researhc on their own to make a diagnosis.  Then they look at possible treatment plans, make an educated decision on the best plan, and then present their findings to the patient, so the patient can make a final decision.

In the NHS, doctors have a 'playbook'.  ""You have X symptoms - you get Y treatment because thats what the book says?  You want Z treatment because you took the time to research on your own, and think you have a better grasp on the problem than I do because you took the time to examine the problem and I didn't?  Well too damn bad, because I'll only prescribe Y, because thats what the rulebook says.  You want Z, you pay with your own damn money""

And if that wasn't bad enough, because EVERY doctor in England is a part of NHS, ""paying with your own damn money"" is actually really hard - most doctors wont take it because 'they dont feel comfortable not following the rulebook""

It's absolute bullshit.  And if you have anything other than a standard issue which falls PERFECTLY in line with their little book of rules and regulations - your fucked.

Working for GAME, I'll admit I have't taken advantage of my staff discount, besides to buy a copy of Diablo III.

So I just save myself the hassle and buy through Steam.

This is what's hurting PC gaming for retail. It isn't that GAME doesn't want to stock PC gaming, of course they do, they want the money. But PC gaming for the average consumer is all kinds of hassle. Every PC game I sell I have to verbally check that they can run the game on their system. You get a lot of consumers who get mad at me insulting their rigs, but I also get a lot of people who don't know better re-evaluating their purchase. 

PC gaming isn't as plug in and play as consoles, and as a result it is often more trouble than it's worth for retailers because we *do* get games returned because customers don't understand that a game that was made for Windows XP SP1 might some fiddling to work on their Windows 7 machine.

How did you get on in school, by the way? Did the accident and the subsequent loss of most of your 1995 memories have an effect on your life?

These comments have really got me thinking about how much a part of my life the NHS actually is. Just in my close family, we have three people who work for the NHS in one role or another and I have another friend who's currently training to be a psychiatric nurse but has had to take a year out as he was diagnosed with testicular cancer (and yes, all his chemo and other treatments were provided by the NHS). As Ghwyr says, you'd have to go pretty far to find a British person without a similar level of involvement than this. It is such a core part of our society that I simply cannot imagine this country without it.

The American mindset towards our healthcare system baffles me. It seems to me that having some of the most basic necessities run by the government isn't such a bad idea, and I think even most Americans would agree if you remove the specifics of healthcare from the equation. Americans have police, courts and prisons all funded by government - either state or federal - funding which is taken in taxes and unless I'm very much mistaken, most Americans are generally in favour of this system. Do they really not see the problem with having both of these viewpoints? Do they not see a government-run courts and legal system as perhaps more than a *teensy* bit socialist? If perhaps they do and if, as many Americans claim, socialism is anti-American, why not run their legal system like their healthcare system? 

Why not have privatised police who only help you if you have insurance? Live in a rough neighbourhood? Oh, I'm sorry, you're too high risk for any insurance company to cover, you'll just have to make do on your own, just try not to get robbed or anything. You could even have criminal courts that only convict criminals if the victims pay the court for their services? That'd be great, right? Judges need to make money and they're providing a service to the victims of crime so why shouldn't those people pay for what they receive?

Americans, if this all seems like a completely repugnant idea when applied to your legal system, why do you continue to support it's application to your healthcare system?

US healthcare is FAR from perfect.  But just like politics, it's the lesser of two evils.

Thats where you're wrong.  Outside of the US, you'd have the $2000, but you'd also have a system that works MUCH LESS of the time.  The US system, despite it's flaws, works.  It might cost more money, but if you need treatment, you're guaranteed to get it somewhere in your country.  So revising what you said, you're left with a new choice

* System where you keep $2000 and have a much lower chance of being treated correctly

or

* System where you're out $2000, but you're almost guarenteed to get the right treatment.  And if you don't, you sue for malpractice and get your $2000 back + another $20k+.

Its also worth mentioning that your story with your wrist sounds very similar to the story with my ankle.  So imagine you're in my shoes, and you have the potential option of keeping your $2000, but you KNOW your wrist is hurt, and because your doctor wont give you an X-ray or an MRI because it doenst fall under the rulebook, you're out the $2000 anyways.

true,RandomHigh,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"Call 0800 055 6688 first thing tomorrow. You can only claim from the day you first contacted them.

Make sure you call from a landline (Or a mobile on the Orange network) as the phone call will last about 15-20 minutes depending on how much detail you have to give them about your work history.

When you go to the job centre, turn up 10 minutes early and go straight in. Don't spend too long standing directly outside of the job centre either. If you get there too early, find somewhere out of the way to wait. You'll know why when you get closer to the building. 

Don't wear earphones inside the building or you won't be able to hear them call your name. Sounds stupid, but I see it all the time.

You didn't mention why you're going to be unemployed. If you're being laid off or a training/trial period is over, make sure you take any paperwork you were given to prove that you are out of work through no fault of your own. Also make sure to take any identification that you can, such as a passport or a driving license or a birth certificate. You may also need to take some utility bills with you. This is to establish your address and identity. These documents will also be needed when you visit your local council office to arrange housing benefit, so it might be a good idea to get a plastic wallet to put them all in.

They will usually ask you for your date of birth and national insurance number as confirmation of who you are, then spend about 20 minutes going through a few forms and taking some details such as your bank account where your benefits will be paid into. They will ask about why you're out of work and what you plan on doing to look for work. They will also have you list 3 job categories that you are looking for on your JSA (Job Seekers Agreement) so it might be a good idea to think about what kind of work you're looking for beforehand.

You'll be given a job diary and a copy of your JSA where you agree to be actively looking for work. Make sure you fill in this job diary at least once a day. Doesn't matter if you don't even look for work, as long as you have something in your job diary that says you have looked for at least one job a day, they most likely won't even check. They will ask that you use multiple methods of job searching, such as internet/local papers/asking friends and family/visiting local businesses.

You'll be asked to sign a few papers and sent on your way, hopefully without having your general positivity for life sucked from your soul.

The job centre won't typically arrange your housing benefit for you unless you suffer from some form of mental handicap (being a chav doesn't count), so you will need to take all of those documents down to your local council main offices. Many councils have district offices where you can do this as well, so you might want to look at your local council website to see which is closest to you.

Go to the main reception and ask for a housing benefit form. **Do not join whatever queueing system they have** to wait to see an advisor at a window/booth as you will need to take the form away with you to fill in and you will waste your time. They should have any forms you need available at the main reception where you should only have to wait 2 minutes to see someone.

Once you have the form, either grab a ticket for the queue and fill it in while you wait, or fill it in at home. Don't worry about going back home and filling it in as your claim is active from the first day you contacted them (the job centre), so you won't lose any money by coming back the next day.

On this form you will have to give them lots of details regarding your rent, including exactly how much it is and who it will be paid to. If you live in a council house/flat then it's a much simpler process, but seeing as though you are a private tenant you may have to involve your landlord.

Some councils work differently and pay you the money directly and you can pay the landlord yourself, some will only pay the landlord. You will have to ask the benefits advisor when you go back to return the form, but for now fill in as much detail as possible.

They will want to see evidence of how much you are paying to the landlord, so any previous receipts would be good, and most importantly you must take with you your bank statements for the past 3 months. Doesn't matter if you have just left work, they may still reject your application if they can't see how much money you have in your bank account and how much you're usually paying out for rent. (If you have over £6,000 in savings you may not be eligible for benefits anyway. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's £6,000, it's been a while since I checked.)

So by now you have filled in the form with all the details that you can. Head on back down to your council offices and make sure you take all of your documents with you, including;

* Passport/Driving license/birth certificate

* Bank/building society statements for the past 3 months

* At least 2 utility bills with your name on them (Gas/Electric/broadband/land line phone)

* The completed (to the best of your ability) housing benefit form.

* Copies of the forms you got at the job centre, JSA agreement/job book etc.

(Originals, NOT photocopies.)

Now you join up whatever queueing system they have and wait.

When you talk to the advisor, be polite and just mention that it's your first time dealing with anything like this and they should be very helpful. If you're not sure about anything at all, for fucks sake ASK. That's what they're there for, and if you mess up something now your claim may be rejected because you didn't fill in the right details somewhere.

When they have checked the form and given you the all clear, make sure you get a receipt. They should print you one or some places write it out by hand, but make sure you get something that says you have returned your completed form.

You should now be done. Say thank you and leave.

And now you wait. They usually take at least 3 or 4 days to even process the forms sometimes, and another few days to send you a letter letting you know what's happening. They may also contact your landlord for confirmation and/or payment details, which could extend the process even longer.

And yes, it can sometimes take up to 6 weeks before your payments come through. So you may want to have a word with your landlord and let him know.",0,1343689216,null,0,false,0,c5lrx83,t3_xel7j,t1_c5lrx83,t1_c5lpq0w,null,1429510875,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,A_User,null,null,"I'm a British expat living in the US.

You're not the only American to be confused as to how Europeans have such 'nice' lives, but I'll try to share my observations, based on my life in both countries.

Firstly: Minimum Wage. In the US, it's $7.25. In the UK, it's £6.08. If we convert that into dollars at the current exchange rate (which, by the way, is far harsher on the pound than it was before the financial crisis in 2008), that puts the UK minimum wage at $9.55.

Obviously, this makes UK's working class substantially wealthier than their American counterparts, and in particular, benefits young adults substantially.

You're right in your assessment that middle class jobs for university grads pay more in the US, but again, the current exchange rate is making that gap look a lot larger right now.

Now, onto taxes and health care.
Tax wise, America's working class gets fucked over. There's a reason you don't see England's poor living in camps of rusting, permanently parked trailers, and its because their income tax is far, far lower. In the case of those without full time employment, it may be functionally zero (with every penny they pay being refunded back to them at the end of the year).

Health care... Well, now this is one of the big ones. In the US, even rudimentary health insurance hits you for $200 a month. To even speak to a doctor will typically run you up $1-200, and even the most basic lab tests and scans can quickly throw you into the $1000 range. God help you if you take a trip to the ER, because that could easily run you up $20k. (Or $140k if, say, a rattlesnake bites you) If you think this doesn't make up the gap, I imagine it's because you've been fortunate enough to never actually need any medical attention in the US (or if you did, your parents paid for it).

Fuel is an interesting one. While petrol/gas prices are indeed 2-3 times higher in the UK, distances traveled are far smaller. Just about nobody in the UK drives half an hour for their groceries. Most kids don't need school buses, and if they do, public transport is, in comparison to what is available in the US (save for a tiny handful of its biggest and wealthiest cities), absolutely phenomenal.

Another factor with transport is the kind of cars people drive. Americans are obsessed with huge 'gas guzzler' 4x4's, SUV's and pickup trucks, and many of them seem happy to sign up to lengthy payment plans that are almost on par with a second mortgage. The majority of Britons (and Europeans in general) don't even *want* cars like this, and where lifestyle trends split, so does the budget. Excess like this bites Americans in the ass at almost every turn.

American middle class homes are far larger than their UK counterparts, and often poorly insulated. This knocks up their heating requirements in winter, and air conditioning requirements in summer. Ah yes, *air conditioning*. No doubt you're currently experiencing the mild warmth that is the British summer, so you can see why nobody in the UK has, or particularly wants or needs any air conditioning. Or a swimming pool.

They're all over America's back yards, but the UK's climate makes the home swimming pool something that most people wouldn't even dream of having, let alone paying for.

Americans are currently debating 'cutting the cord' on the cable TV as subscription fees rise and the internet provides on-demand alternatives, but they hold this discussion as if having subscription TV is the norm. The default. Near-essential. In the UK, cable and satellite TV is a luxury rather than a must-have, mostly because of the BBC, and the fact that the country is small enough for terrestrial broadcasters to cover the whole area of it relatively easily. What do Britons pay for this? a £100 or so annual TV license and the price of a cheap digital receiver. 

...And they also turn their TV off when they're not watching it. Americans leave everything on. EVERYTHING. *All the time*. It's really quite bizarre for me to watch. Almost nothing is ever turned off in the American home. The closest most things come to 'off' is standby, but as we all know, that isn't *off*. I point the blame for this behavior squarely at the American power outlet. For Brits reading this, it *has no on/off switch*. Even I can't be bothered to piss around unplugging things, and so as much as I would like to turn things off, appliances get left on 24/7, 365 days a year, slowly draining energy and money.",0,1343689643,null,0,1343699032,0,c5ls0un,t3_xef41,t1_c5ls0un,t3_xef41,null,1429510923,26,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,26

Because it doesn't make them advertising money. Taking that money in the first place was originally justified and only ever sort of justifiable as a means to an end, and the end was promotion of Olypism. Now they're actively fighting the end in order to promote the means (and get more financial means). And of course the Games have now turned the audience into the product that's being sold to advertisers who demand exclusive access to those eyeballs. None of which has anything to do with Olympism anymore. If the IOC had an honest bone left, they'd admit it and say: *[""We are not with That, but with Them, and that is our secret! For decades have we abandoned That to follow Them.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grand_Inquisitor)* Instead of furthering any and all promotion of Olympism and the Games, you now have to ask permission and pay money in order to be allowed to promote it. It's so absurd, it would be funny if it weren't so sad.

As for the argument that personality doesn't really change after regeneration, that ignores the obvious fact that his DNA is completely rewriten every time. Personality is as much a fact of biology as it is personal history.

As for the relationship with the master, they are the same species and have a much longer and in depth personal history then he can possibly form with any human companion.

How easy is navigating the underground from Heathrow to Fulham Rd.?

If we had to use a ""tout"", what should we expect to pay?

Should we not be able to obtain tickets, where is the best place in London to watch a CFC match? 

Is the stadium tour available matchday or only on days without a game? For those that have done it, how long does it take?

Any suggestions for other things to do/see in the very short amount of time we will be in London?

true,samw11,english,Sunny Runny,"* The national Minumum wage in the UK works out (based on a 37.5 hour working week) at £11,856 p/a.
* We (none of us) pay tax on the first £8,105 (that goes up when you get old - 65+)
* People on low incomes can apply for working families tax credits - we're not eligible for them because we earn too much now, so I don't know what the criteria is.
* People with children (who earn less than £50k p/a) get child benefit for every child they have - it's paid in cash so it doesn't necessarily have to be spent on nappies!
* people shop in a variety of supermarkets - people with limited budgets are likely to buy food from places like Aldi/Lidl because it's cheaper
* Going out isn't necessarily expensive if you go fo the cheap option. For example, we pay £14.99 each pcm for cinema passes to cineworld cinemas (it's more if you live in London, but there is a Cineworld in the centre of Edinburgh near to the EICC), we can go to the flicks as often as we want during the month (if you go twice you're even, 3 times &amp; you're winning) and you get 10% off at the concessions stand - we don't often use the concessions stand because it keeps it cheaper if we don't, but we go to the cinema about once a week.
* you don't have to do that - most cinema's have cheap tickets on Tuesday's (no idea why - must be a quiet night everywhere) &amp; most do the orange wednesday's thing where it's buy one get one free if you have an orange phone &amp; text the number (You must have seen that one advertised).
* most restaurants/pubs etc do cheap meal deals if you eat on a certain night/before 5.30-6pm, or even have a set menu, Carluccio's (I know there's one in Chester &amp; one in London &amp; presume they have them elsewhere) do a set menu of 2 courses for less than £10, add a glass of wine &amp; afters &amp; it's £15 each. still cheap.
* do you shop ever? You should save loyalty points. Tesco clubcard &amp; Sainsbury's nectar thingy are the ones we use most often - you can spend them on your grocery shop, buy clothes with them, use them for a day trip/holiday. We used out nectar points last March towards a Eurostar trip to Paris - it cost us £40 return on top of the nectar points we had.
* Budget. That's how people get by for the most part. I know the full tv package seems really important &amp; it's only a little bit more than the next level down, but really, it's better in your pocket than theirs. Phone them and threaten to cancel, they usually offer a discount for a few months, we dropped our package down, we've saved a fortune &amp; honestly haven't missed it.
* Make a list of EVERYTHING that you spend money on, work out where it's going &amp; then make a list of what you would rather be spending the money on. At some point, you'll catch yourself and think ""no, I'd be better off if I just had a soft drink/a regular meal/no pudding"".
* that's another thing - when you go out for a drink, drink a soft drink/water in between each alcoholic drink. Not everyone does, but it'll make your money go further &amp; reduce your hangover.
* People are being more energy conscious now, because turning the telly off at the wall, may take an extra 10 seconds, but it'll save you a few quid on your electric bill.
* &amp; our British rationing hangover... Make do and mend. People are being less 'throw-away' than we were in the 1980's. This reduce, reuse, recycle thing is actually cheaper than just buy it and bin it. If you need something 'big' (or expensive) try the local buy &amp; sell/Freecycle or even a car boot sale or charity shops. Ok it might not be right classy, but no-one needs to know that your new frock is from Oxfam.
* Oh &amp; use your local library... free books, cheap CD's &amp; DVD's and free internet access... might only save you a little bit, but if you actually go to a bookshop &amp; buy a paperback - you're talking anything from £3 in Tesco to £7.99 in Smiths/Waterstones... it's free in the library provided you take it back.
* Also, (God this post is getting a bit long) learn to cook. It's cheaper to buy some chicken, some chilli powder and a few other basics that will make 2 curries and a chinese stir fry than it is to buy 3 jars of sauce and some chicken or half a dozen ready meals. Plus, it might be fun &amp; if you go one Come Dine with Me and win... there's a grand to go in your depleted savings account (&amp; apparently they give you £250 for the ingredients/drink &amp; entertainment).

Here ends Sam's great money saving advice... I probably have loads more but it's late and I'm tired &amp; my laptop battery is flashing at me &amp; I can't reach the charger!!!

I believe that if the US adopted a universal system, it would look similar to Medicare and Medicaid because we already have a healthcare industry made up of privately owned facilities.

true,soothfast,eng-dorset,Dorset - Who's afear'd!,"Depends who can afford to buy.  You can have many people moving here who don't have the means to buy and rely on housing benefit to rent.  Which is why the cutting of housing benefit is so significant.  Its a way of cooling the housing market.  Don't underestimate the effect Buy to Let has had on the UK housing market.  Second home ownership is a big issue - its not just about housing shortages but about who owns the houses and how they financed that purchase.  Often its a house of cards with people using the equity to get a BTL.  But if they lose that equity and need to remortgage..... well.  We shall see.  There are plenty of ""entrepreneurs"" who are millionaires on paper but in reality they are just indebted to the banks and on VERY shaky territory.  
  
I've not even mentioned interest only mortgages!!  i.e renting from the bank.  That's another timebomb awaiting to go off as people try to remortgage and find they can't (as banks aren't willing to offer interest only) so they are stuck.  Banks aren't offering interest only because customers are making no provision to pay back the loan at the end of the term.  In the boom years they assumed the equity would pay it back.  But you simply cannot have equity growing and growing ad infinitum.  Its impossible.  You can always tell how much banks think prices will fall from the LTV values.  If they want 10 - 20% deposits then that's what they think prices have to fall up to now as they are covering themselves for any price drops.",0,1343692730,null,0,1343693105,0,c5lsrq3,t3_xes79,t1_c5lsrq3,t1_c5ls8h7,null,1429511279,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,ejgwhite,null,null,"Australian here. We have a two tier universal health care system called Medicare. It's provides most of what you'll need but there's strong incentives to top this up with ""private health"" care that includes choices of doctors, private rooms in hospitals, skip some queues etc. Apart from some waiting periods - ie you can't sign up to a health fund and get private Obstetrics care when you're 8 months pregnant - the private health funds aren't allowed to not cover you due to a pre-existing condition. The additional, optional private health cover isn't expensive either.

While there are some stuff ups, the system works well. As in the NHS, allocation of services is based on medical needs, not on ability to pay.

You're covered cradle to grave as long as you're an Australian citizen or permanent resident regardless of whether you're working or not.

Health systems and hospitals are funded at a state level. About the only political debate is when elections come around you'll find both sides promising to tip *more* into the health care system!

Generally speaking, universal health care in Western countries works well once they're up and running.  The only reason to think otherwise is that you've been lied to. Nothing to do with ""freedom"" or ""gubbermint control"". It's all about being modern health care being available to all regardless of you ability to pay. Societies offer roads, public transport, police forces, military protection so why not health care?

I really do feel sorry for my American friends who have to worry about health care costs instead of concentrating on getting well. I remember listening to a friend of mine in LA tell me about the stress he was under as he had the chance to move to a better job, but was risking losing health benefits for his severely asthmatic kid.

That green plastic Medicare card in my wallet never felt so good...

However even the commentators did not know that she had received a penalty, and neither did the crowd, coach or player apparently as there was a lot of confusion and protest. This is the essence of the controversy, just a mis-communication.

A touch normally gives 1 point, but they were tied after the initial rounds and were in a sudden-death 'next-touch-wins' stage. However the Korean had 'priority' (no idea how this is decided, seems stupid to me) so if the sudden-death round ended with neither player scoring a touch, the player with priority is given the win.

That being said, it is a Wednesday game and midweek fixtures traditionally have lower attendances. To improve your chances I'd buy a ticket membership, don't want to come all this way and be disappointed. With even the most basic membership you can buy your tickets long before General Sale. 1 Membership each (you can link them so tickets purchased are next to each other) will let you buy tickets in the first window, if you share 1 membership you save like £25/$40 but you'll have to wait until the 1+2 ticket (3 max per person) window, could be sold out by then. I wouldn't risk it. It's cheaper to buy these memberships than it will be buying from any tout, and with no risk. I've seen plenty of people thrown out of the Bridge for buying scalped tickets, bad times. Tout prices may be £100+ while a membership and ticket combo direct from club will total the same if not less. Do it early, memberships can take a little while to activate, tickets on sale 6 weeks before kickoff

Anyway, to your guys questions...

On game day, Earls Court is a mess, but the plethora of Blue shirts make it easy to follow people, even if you have no idea where you're going. EC is the quickest route, Picadilly line from Heathrow to EC, District Line heading South towards Wimbledon, 2 stops. No beef wearing a Chelsea shirt, most people will be. Journey time of around 45 mins I'd estimate. Assuming Heathrow Terminal 3, unless you lucky colonials fly BA and enjoy T5, it's a 5 min walk clearly signposted as you exit the arrivals area. Take the tube, not Heathrow Express and you'll be at EC pretty swiftly

Stadium tour availability I'm not sure about, but I do believe it's far more frequent than just game days. For actual dates check chelseafc.com or get in touch with the club

Thomas Cook are the official club partner, so anything they have is legit, if overpriced. Expedia the hotel they offer and add in the ticket price to see what the better deal is. Thousands of hotels in London, no issue getting a room in late November

You hardly have any time to sight see, but even in 3 weeks you couldn't hope to see half the things in London, easily the most attraction-dense city in the world. See if something in particular really appeals and go for that. In full tourist mode I'd say hit Trafalgar Square, walk up the Mall to Buckingham Palace, few drinks in one of the many bars in that area and try and check out Houses of Parliament. This is obviously the most subjective thing so let me know your interests if you want a more specific recommendation, though the above is pretty useful for these 1 night wonders

Hero's is a sandwich bar in a small road just off Cornmarket which is really nice although the best quality/price ratio is probably the Taylors sandwich bars.

Pasties can be found at the West Cornwall Pasty Company on Cornmarket and at the Queens street exit of the Clarendon Centre.

Pastries, sandwich and other snacks can be found at any of Le Croissanterie outlets.

As mentioned previously The Mission is great value for money.

If your willing to spend a little more and are looking for some more interesting places The Nosebag is an upstairs restaurant on St Michaels street off of Cornmarket and does nice meals. Also, Maxwell's on Queen Street is also upstairs and is a burger bar by day and a club by night.

Little Clarendon Street is a nice place with several (mostly french) restaurants that are quite expensive but nice; it also has one of the city's 3 G&amp;D cafes that do amazing ice cream.

Finally I should mention the Cowley Road which has a lot of takeaways and exotic restaurants. It also has Atomic Burger, excellent, and Atomic Pizza which I am sure is good although I haven't been.

I signed with the Liverpool youth academy when I was 14 after scoring +9 goals a game in 5 straight games of a tournament, I was the youngest guy there by 2 or so years and they had me as a deep lying attacker.

My older brother signed with west ham a couple of years before me like most kids back then because west ham were the shit for brining in youth players, I was small for my age and skinny but I was ridiculously quick, could swerve in and out of players with ease, good control with a great last touch. 

Most of this skill came from [playing on small cramped football cages](http://www.mapleleaf-designs.co.uk/Images/ball%20cage.jpg) where you dont have much room to manoeuvre and think so you develop quick reflexes and because the goals are small you gain great accuracy

It all looked promising because I scored in my first 5 youth games (the level now was much much higher so harder to score but not impossible) but I hated being away from friends and family and it was very strict, bed at 8 then up at 6 for a run even on weekends, then school but we were not allowed to do pe or any sports, then back and training, only eating certain foods, always travelling I got sick and tired of it.

We had just played Arsenal and I then injured my left ankle trying to curl the ball but my foot and ankle rolled on the ground. im ambidextrous and most goals came from my right and because I was on a good streak they wanted me to play because it was an important youth league game so they wanted to inject my foot with painkillers and make me play.

I came on in the 70th, scored a dodgy free kick and won it for us, the next day I couldnt walk on my ankle but they still made me go for the run, it got worse and worse, went to the club Dr who told me I had torn the muscle in my ankle. 

I had the surgery and quit then and there, out of rage but soon learned the Dr would have medically terminated me. I got to meet Gérard Houllier and Ian Rush (who told me) and they gave me the golden boot for that month and was coaches choice at the end of that season. 

I was then 17 and my ankle didnt fully heal till I was about 21 (everytime Id kick something or try and run it would kill) 

The club are cool and they send me training gear every year as a thank you and a sorry for what happened, I only just started playing again and scored 2 in 2 games coming on as a sub both times so maybe I still have it.

I would say that, looking at it as pure supply and demand, it wouldn't be surprising if increasing wages and increasing productivity in the global economy lead to a greater percentage of wages being spent on housing. So you pay a certain amount for a house, and a certain amount for food, gas, clothing etc, and earn a certain amount. Your wage goes up, which means that food, gas, clothing etc become cheaper as a percentage of your wage (especially in combination with globalization and cheap imported goods). Now you have a greater percentage of your wage to spend on other things, and housing is one of the most important things you can buy for quality of life. But the guy you're bidding against to buy that delightful new flat is in exactly the same position, with the same extra money to spend. And hence you bid each other up until one of you ends up using up that spare money. So housing ends up rising, not only in absolute terms, but also as a percentage of wages.

He would see a patient about a problem and then send for tests and do the normal doctor thing. That's X dollars. He would bill the insurance company for x and the insurance company will only pay a fraction of x. Depending on the company that fraction could be 50% or it could be much less. This is why some doctors only accept some insurance. 

Anyway, Dad couldn't keep his practice open after his partner retired without inflating what he billed the insurance companies. in effect, doubling his prices. so he closed is practice and signed on with a larger health care company. He pulls a salary now like the rest of us working stiffs for the same thing that he' always done, and from his perspective it doesn't really matter whether that salary comes from the company he's at, or the federal government. 

But the things that make a single payer system really work are the economies of scale and vertical integration that makes Walmart the international force it is. It's more efficient to have a single price for a treatment, and a single system on how that's paid out. You get rid of redundant logistics.

That's not only sensationalist, it's ridiculous.  The British value their system because they realize how fragile and important it is.  Canada's the same way.

Anyway.  Your glut of links.  We both know that I can Google the exact same type of horror stories from American hospitals.

It certainly doesn't mean that the American, British, or Canadian systems are inefficient baby-murderers; it's simply individual cases of unpleasantness.  You need statistics before anecdotal evidence is useful, and unfortunately, formal statistics almost always show government-funded universal health care is vastly superior to whatever crazy shit the Americans have fumbled themselves into now.

It is a goverment program sure, but do you identify the members of your fire service and the jobs they do with the government? It's just one of many things you're perfectly happy for your taxes to be spent on (I presume), and which no politician would be stupid enough to suggest ought to be privatised. Even in America, right?

[Wrong!](http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/2006/04/01/privatized-fire-district-keeps-costs-low-and-service-high)

Some quotes from the article:

&gt;""Our first-year contract was $300,000, and we were providing the same level of service the consultant said would cost $1 million,"" Jensen said. ""We continue to provide service as good as that of our municipal neighbors, but because we are private, we can operate more efficiently. We save 30 to 40 percent over what a similar municipal department would cost to operate.""

...

&gt;""We don't pay the insane salaries that our municipal neighbors pay,"" Jensen said. ""Our benefits are more in line with traditional industry. We are non-union, which gives us a lot more flexibility in dealing with our employees. Salaries and benefits are the big savings, but we [also] have a shop where we can rebuild and refurbish fire apparatus for our own use.

...

&gt;The fire district contracts with the Bloomingdale Fire Department for dispatching, even though the latter is a government-run operation. ""Bloomingdale has state-of-the-art dispatch and can do it a lot less expensively than we can,"" Jensen said. ""So we outsource to somebody else who can do something a lot more efficiently.""

So, they're a private fire brigade that can't operate without the help from a public fire brigade and they pay their firemen peanuts. Of course they can save 30-40%, they're only running half a service, leeching off the government for the other half (while being paid to do so) and seem to be hiring bums off the street.

In regards to your tattoo, make sure you actually want it, considering it's a crappy Chelsea badge and all... (kidding) But seriously, those types of tattoos look corny and most the time they aren't done properly. 

However, if you really do want one, I go to this great place in Greater London called ""Diamond Jacks"" . [Map of the parlour](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Diamond+Jacks+Tattoo+Parlour&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en) It only takes 15 mins to get there from stamford bridge, and you can go see other places afterwards.

This other one is good too if you want your tattoo to be detailed and have a contrasting Blue color, however I think this place is more expensive.

Her mother is the voice telling her to just be content with working class, trying to spur her into another job after the explosion opposed to seeing it as an opportunity to do something different. This languid attitude towards her daily life is what draws her to life on the TARDIS with the Doctor.

Donna faces her mother's disappointment as well as her own dissatisfaction with herself. The Doctor helps her feel important and special which is what makes her a good companion.  The best companion-Doctor relationships are the ones where they both have something to offer the other. What the Doctor gave Rose and Donna was similar in many ways. He basically gave them encouragement and love (both romantic and platonic) because that is what they both needed. And they each gave him something or helped him in some huge way. 

Martha, on the other hand, was a confidant and educated young woman. She had ambition and drive. Her reasons for traveling with the Doctor were different. It was more of an escape from daily life and family difficulties rather than a need for a complete overhaul. Which is why she left of her own accord unlike Donna and Rose. She didn't need the Doctor for anything more than a temporary escape, which is what she was for him (from the pain of losing Rose).

Will it be a loan to West Ham with a view to make it permanent? Likely. You would assume that Liverpool have spent the past 4 or 5 days shopping the £2 + 17 deal around and have finally settled.

Timing? It is now over to the player, so you probably have 2-3 days between agent and the clubs and then another 2-3 days with medical. Add another day or so for a proper press announcement. This can all be done quicker, but with the weight of this deal it likely won't be.

What we have seen in the media over the past 2 weeks with Carroll (and Aqua) is a pretty typical progression for a transfer deal, especially a larger type deal that takes a bit of work to get through. LFC have definitely been playing the media in getting this deal done, and it was probably somebody from the club who leaked todays story in order to get a last minute counter-offer out of anybody else.

true,bpcoxkr,canada,South of,"I'm a British expat living in the US.

&gt;You're not the only American to be confused as to how Europeans have such 'nice' lives, but I'll try to share my observations, based on my life in both countries.

Yeah, I'm one of them 

&gt;Firstly: Minimum Wage. In the US, it's $7.25. In the UK, it's £6.08. If we convert that into dollars at the current exchange rate (which, by the way, is far harsher on the pound than it was before the financial crisis in 2008), that puts the UK minimum wage at $9.55.

It's true the minimum wage is that, but to be honest I don't think that's the primary factor at play

&gt;Obviously, this makes UK's working class substantially wealthier than their American counterparts, and in particular, benefits young adults substantially.
&gt;
&gt;You're right in your assessment that middle class jobs for university grads pay more in the US, but again, the current exchange rate is making that gap look a lot larger right now.

I looked at cost of living, and realistically even with the minimum wage differences the Purchasing power of a minimum wage brit and a minimum wage american should be the same. Not that the index is entirely accurate. I'm not sure what is leading to the salary disparities in fields that require education, though.

&gt;Now, onto taxes and health care.
&gt;Tax wise, America's working class gets fucked over. There's a reason you don't see England's poor living in camps of rusting, permanently parked trailers, and its because their income tax is far, far lower. In the case of those without full time employment, it may be functionally zero (with every penny they pay being refunded back to them at the end of the year).

To be fair, although Americans do tend to pay sales taxes, some fees etc, the income tax rates for those with income under $30,000 (bottom 50%) a year is very very minimal. I think it's around 4-6 percent, but I don't recall exactly.

&gt;Health care... Well, now this is one of the big ones. In the US, even rudimentary health insurance hits you for $200 a month. To even speak to a doctor will typically run you up $1-200, and even the most basic lab tests and scans can quickly throw you into the $1000 range. God help you if you take a trip to the ER, because that could easily run you up $20k. (Or $140k if, say, a rattlesnake bites you) If you think this doesn't make up the gap, I imagine it's because you've been fortunate enough to never actually need any medical attention in the US (or if you did, your parents paid for it).

Having dealt with my own medical expenses for around a year now, there are substantial medical costs. On the HMO (cheaper, but limited access with referrals required) I was paying around 5-6k per year, but I also have super severe back issues. On the PPO my family and I combined probably spend 9k/year, which is the cap that you have to pay (I'm still on their health insurance). This is well above standard, the fees themselves, excluding copays (the money you pay for service recieved). Then again, my family has fairly good but expensive insurance. I'd like some sort of national healthcare, but the culture of america, which relies upon self dependence, and survival of the fittest just won't allow for it to happen. In one sense, I'd like to move to Europe/UK (yeah, it's part of Europe)/even korea for both cultural and medical reasons but it's just hard to fathom a move like that. I had poor health care, but the one advantage the US has is access to truly wonderful tertiary care centers. How do you gauge your access to high level medical care (for severe conditions) and how hard is it to get referred?

&gt;Fuel is an interesting one. While petrol/gas prices are indeed 2-3 times higher in the UK, distances traveled are far smaller. Just about nobody in the UK drives half an hour for their groceries. Most kids don't need school buses, and if they do, public transport is, in comparison to what is available in the US (save for a tiny handful of its biggest and wealthiest cities), absolutely phenomenal.

I drive like 5-10 minutes for groceries in a compact car, but in the middle of the country this is true. I'd love better mass transit, but again the distances traveled make affordable mass transit difficult. While I know london is overpriced, I noted train tickets were still fairly pricey in the UK, and the tube tickets were insane (ended up getting travelpass because i was running about doing touristy things, but nonetheless was around 100 dollars for a week of transit, far more than I spend here. Then we rented a car and drove to scotland. Although gas was absurdly priced, at least the car got great mileage.
&gt;Another factor with transport is the kind of cars people drive. Americans are obsessed with huge 'gas guzzler' 4x4's, SUV's and pickup trucks, and many of them seem happy to sign up to lengthy payment plans that are almost on par with a second mortgage. The majority of Britons (and Europeans in general) don't even *want* cars like this, and where lifestyle trends split, so does the budget. Excess like this bites Americans in the ass at almost every turn.

People buy escalades, and then get six miles per gallon (1.5 miles per liter.) Then they whine about high gas prices. Anyways, I don't see the need for a large car, the largest I'd ever want would be a ""mid size american sedan"" ala ford fusion. And yeah, there is a ton of american excess which bugs me.

&gt;American middle class homes are far larger than their UK counterparts, and often poorly insulated. This knocks up their heating requirements in winter, and air conditioning requirements in summer. Ah yes, *air conditioning*. No doubt you're currently experiencing the mild warmth that is the British summer, so you can see why nobody in the UK has, or particularly wants or needs any air conditioning. Or a swimming pool.

Simply societal differences. And yeah, insulation pays for itself bigtime, but people don't' do it. The utility companies are subsidizing it, but people are too stupid and lazy to do so.

&gt;They're all over America's back yards, but the UK's climate makes the home swimming pool something that most people wouldn't even dream of having, let alone paying for.

&gt;Americans are currently debating 'cutting the cord' on the cable TV as subscription fees rise and the internet provides on-demand alternatives, but they hold this discussion as if having subscription TV is the norm. The default. Near-essential. In the UK, cable and satellite TV is a luxury rather than a must-have, mostly because of the BBC, and the fact that the country is small enough for terrestrial broadcasters to cover the whole area of it relatively easily. What do Britons pay for this? a £100 or so annual TV license and the price of a cheap digital receiver. 

Well, most of the country is covered by terrestrial broadcast in the United States, if you're willing to get a roof antenna (60usd or so). I have super basic cable (20usd per month) so that I get a couple additional channels, and don't have to mess with an antenna, but if I wanted any more stations, it costs at least 40 pounds per month. In fact, I can't even access this online NBC olympics crap, because I don't get the other stations, where most of the coverage is. (I'm stealing your BBC for olympics). In fact, they charge per additional tv, and charge for HD, and charge for this and that, and then they have the only good TV. I've just resorted to internet TV, but the whole thing really costs americans absurd amounts. I'd estimate most of my friends families paid around 100 quid per month on home phone, TV, and internet. And at least 100 quid on cell service for the family. Then again, I'm in an extremely high income area.

&gt;...And they also turn their TV off when they're not watching it. Americans leave everything on. EVERYTHING. *All the time*. It's really quite bizarre for me to watch. Almost nothing is ever turned off in the American home. The closest most things come to 'off' is standby, but as we all know, that isn't *off*. I point the blame for this behavior squarely at the American power outlet. For Brits reading this, it *has no on/off switch*. Even I can't be bothered to piss around unplugging things, and so as much as I would like to turn things off, appliances get left on 24/7, 365 days a year, slowly draining energy and money.

Power in america is super cheap, so that's not really a huge difference, but your observations are true. I love having switches on the outlet, and you can actually get those in the United States, but most don't have them.",0,1343707994,null,0,1343713045,0,c5lwkhx,t3_xef41,t1_c5lwkhx,t1_c5ls0un,null,1429513133,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,tehJink,tardis,TARDIS,"I believe Donna is an attempt to explain why there IS such a depth to the relationship.

Ret-com was the right word... Maybe this will never be referenced again but it seems to me like something the writers were considering to tie up a lot of old series loose ends, while starting up the 'Who is the Doctor?' storyline. I've never believed the 'threefold man' reference was JUST to the meta-crisis/Doctordonna/Doctor, remember Dalek Caan saw the WHOLE of space and time and there is another legendary three figures in Time Lord History.

The Doctor travels through time so 'recent' is an irrelevant term. Donna could live her entire lifetime before becoming the TARDIS and that transformation could still have taken place millenia before if the Doctor picked her up and took her on a trip. Even if she was dying of natural causes, it can only be assumed that would free the energy, potentially catastrophically. Obviously then it is not only LIKELY but inevitable that the Doctor has plans to deal with that. The most obvious way for a Time Lord to do so would be to freeze her in time. Save her in a way, trapped in an eternal moment as her mind expands and sees all of time and space at once. 

Like a TARDIS.

In truth perhaps its truer to say I believe she becomes the 'Mother' of TARDIS, being the hand of Omega. The Doctor is known to be AT LEAST The Other, if not also Omega and Rassilon, who were present at the 'controlled' supernova initiated with the Hand of Omega. Im sure, check me here, its mentioned somewhere all the TARDIS share a single soul?

Whose soul?

There's a pleasing Ourorborus type effect going on here if so.. To place alongside the whole Merlin aspect of born old and getting younger. (Mostly)

Introduces hand, founds time lords, hops in loom, is reborn millenia later, steals TARDIS. 

Wibbly wobbly timey wimey, you said it yo damn self.

Then after wasting away in a museum, with a type 40 TT as the lens, Donna's latent idiosyncratic nature and identity is somewhat brought out by recognition of her thief.

Yes the TARDIS has always had a soul and if you accept Gaiman as canon, one who remembers the idiosyncratically human experience of kissing, btw.

And at the time I feel like people liked the New Deal. While far from perfect, the characterization of the New Deal as an evil or wasteful collection of programs is more a recent conservative invention. The Interstate Highway System turned out okay and was referred to as the largest public works program since the Pyramids.

So it's true that today a majority of Americans distrust government programs, but is it because they were taught/mislead to think this way? I'd be curious to know if there was a time when Americans took more pride in government institutions, and how aware people who ""hate"" the government are of their reliance on government systems.

&gt;However, it is thought the 23-year-old Carroll does not wish to leave Liverpool on a permanent basis.

**Daily Mail**
&gt;However, it is understood that Carroll would prefer a move back to his native North East if he is forced to leave Liverpool and is likely to shun West Ham’s offer.

**Telegraph**
&gt;Liverpool are understood to have accepted the offer, although it remains to be seen whether Carroll agrees to the move as he has privately expressed his desire to return to Newcastle United.

**The Guardian**
&gt;Andy Carroll will resist a move to West Ham United, even though Liverpool have accepted a bid from the London club that appeared to signal the end of the striker's time at Anfield. Liverpool have told West Ham that they can have Carroll on loan for the season in exchange for £2m, but that West Ham must then pay a further £17m to make the deal permanent if they retain their Premier League status.

Indian chiming in here - I also suspect the issue has more to do with respect for institutions. Both Brazil and India have some terrible issues with people actually giving a crap about institutions, and have terrific corruption to add to the mess.

Heck I remember reading how some people were building super villas in the middle of protected reserves in the rain forest in Brazil.

And for Indian corruption, well, its pretty rank. Rent seekers everywhere. We've had the upper echelons of Govt bend and break housing norms to get a building made which, was worth a bomb because of the property it was built on. Not to mention the constant destruction of mangroves and illegal sand dredging going on almost everywhere.

Civic mindedness is often lagging in developing countries. Most Americans know a very advanced form of corruption, which is far more benign but insidious than in your face corruption. (Once upon a time expats used to look at America and say ""the system just works"")

I don't doubt that one reason the NHS works because the people in the system uphold it. 

It can be done and done well. But if you attack the system, and make it fight a million battles from day 1, you divert effort from taking care of people.

TLDR: We can't compare the US system with the Brazillian system. They are far too different from each other. Also, once upon a time America was a place where ""The system just works"". They can do it again.

Plus, the NHS is probably much better than people in lay conversation describe. The Brits are notorious for being able to make fun of themselves and take joy in being miserable.

true,oyezoyezoyez,null,null,"You must be referring to ""tort reform"" - that magical change which will cause health care costs to plummet. Right. Tort reform in states has been great for insurance companies, but savings haven't been passed along to consumers.

""Tort reform""  also has the effect of capping malpractice awards. So if you or your family member is the victim of medical malpractice, your jury award is capped at a certain amount. Say your kid becomes a vegetable and needs constant care for the rest of their life as the result of a routine surgery in which their oxygen was cut off long enough to cause brain damage? Even if a jury awards $12 million - a reasonable sum to cover expenses through age 45 - noneconomic damages in Texas are capped at $250,000. And Texas has some of the worst health care outcomes in the U.S.

""Tort reform"" is a bait and switch, and ignores the real cost drivers behind medical inflation. I recommend the documentary [Hot Coffee](http://www.hotcoffeethemovie.com/) for more information.

Finally, the socialized medicine you speak of seems like it suffers from a problem that is unrelated to medicine - systemic corruption. You can argue about when the right time to reform our broken health care system is:

- PS: Every lightbulb, pen, PET machine and drug used in the NHS comes from the private sector. An overlooked point, I feel.

Even in the US, India and almost anywhere in the world other than soviet russia and the PDRK will this be the case.

The heck? I can't fathom what you were aiming to say, since you've ended up implying that to be truly nationalized an institution should have a dedicated foundry so that they can make their own forceps.

Either way, since that implication couldn't possibly be your main thrust, (I assume), it must meet the next criteria to be a useful comparative metric -

How does that make it any difference from others in the comp set? 

Its a commonality for all health systems and as a common factor, can be canceled out. Sure there are some *specific and narrow* topics where the differences are relevant, otherwise not.


Further your discussion is itself, extremely narrow when compared to the scope of what the original comment is. A comparison of the relative merits between 2 different systems. Not a SWOT analysis of the NHS.

We are discussing here a system that works very well, the NHS, in comparison to a system that works by bankrupting its beneficiaries, the US Medical system.

What you don't mention, if you wanted to bring Cancer up, is the massive cost, which bankrupts and destroys insurance plans in America. Nor do you mention that the American outcomes are also influenced by having most of  the most advanced research institutions in the world working there. 

The Americans fought a **war on cancer**. 

The Brits said : **No society can call itself civilised if a sick person is denied help because of finance**. They said this *after* they got bombed to the cretaceous in WW2.

So saying 
&gt; ""Please don't rant like this. ..."" is a bit much. 
in a conversation discussing relative merits by describing superlative comparative outcomes which occur regularly, is irrelevance. 

You could do more for your own case by just stating the outcomes you would like to see improve.

However, if you go into any emergency room, they are legally obligated to treat you regardless of the fact that you may not be able to pay the fees. What this does is that now the people w/o healthcare use the emergency room for all sorts of minor(read non life-threatening) injuries because they can't get it through normal channels. However since they can't pay, the premiums on those who do pay go up. And know, trying to afford healthcare just became that much more difficult. And so on and so on. 

The nice thing is if you have healthcare, you don't have to pay a penny over your deductible. In my case, I'm under my parents insurance and its set up that my parents pay up to $3000 and anything else, the insurance covers. One night in college, I got wasted drunk and passed out. A overly-concerned bystander called the ambulance/911. When they came, since I wasn't responsive, they took me to a trauma center and ran the entire battery of tests on me (CAT Scan, MRI, etc). All the tests basically informed the doctors that I was fine but just really drunk i.e. I just needed to sleep it off. The next day, I looked at the bills/charts and it amounted to a little over $20,000 and adding in about another $1000 for ambulance - my parents would have been on the hook for $21000 and b/c of their insurance, they only had to pay $3000. To take it further, my mom's coworker got cancer. I asked my mom about the financial part and she said that because of the healthcare provided by the employer, she doesn't have to pay a cent over $3000 - even though the costs for cancer treatment go upwards of $1 million - chemo tests, radiation, pills etc. In situations like these, insurance is a godsend.

true,FreakinLaura,dalek,Dalek,"Well, I think Vincent and the Doctor is a really good choice.  
First off, it's super amazing.
More importantly, Vincent and the Doctor can mostly stand alone from the other episodes even though there are important emotions there. (Yeah, they've just lost Rory and everyone is sad and that's important, but that's not very important in this particular episode if you aren't watching it in order.) Your friend needs to understand what's going on or else she'll get frustrated and quit.
This episode is also a wonderful illustration of the concept of the show, since you get to see the Doctor and his companion climb into his Tardis and whisk themselves into the past to fight monsters with Vincent Van Gogh.  It's perfect, really.  A madman with a box having adventures throughout time and space.
It's also a great episode to start out with because of the emotion of the story of Vincent Van Gogh.  When they bring Vincent back to the present and he sees himself in this museum and whatnot, and he's like, weeping with joy, and then they take him back and Amy is all, ""There will be loads of new paintings!"" but there aren't any because Vincent has committed suicide just like he always did, and then everyone is sad, it's just loaded with emotion.  I think it's really important for your friend to see that there is emotion and that it's not just some useless, ridiculous fantasy about a time traveling alien.  The emotion is the best way to show substance.  (I started out with those two tenth doctor episodes with the Master, and I was kind of interested from the beginning, but then when the Doctor was rocking the Master in his arms and begging him to regenerate, I stood no chance.)
In short, the whole thing was completely brilliant, and I think you should go with that.

I'm a small business man, cabinet maker and have worked in Canada and now in the UK.  When in Canada, I made between $5,000-$9,000 per month piece work as a joiner, depending on the complexity of the work.  Here in the UK i can barely make enough to cover the cost of running a business.  I haven't seen a pay check in the last 5 years in the UK, it all goes into the business.

There is a culture that seems prevalent in the UK that no one seems to want anyone else to make more then they do and we continually beat the crap out of anyone who does, chipping away at the high earners.  Lately we have attacked the truck drivers and doctors as an example, its been all over the news.  

Second, the UK is over taxed.  The whole of the UK fits into one province in Canada that has a population of 3 million.  Imagine the infrastructure that is needed for a co0untry the size of canada, now understand that they do that with the taxation of 30 Million people.  Here in the UK we have 60 Million that are paying close to 70% in taxes of varying types, and we still need to borrow half of our budget to keep things running.  Something is desperately wrong with that.

So at the end of the day people borrow to maintain the image of a life style, just like the government.  House prices are inflated by the bank to enslave us, we are literally collateral for our government to borrow against.  Taxes do not pay for the things we have, governments borrow for that and our taxes pay the piper.

You will be bored (take a book)

It will take HOURS (take a *long* book)

It will suck &amp; leave you feeling lower than the lowest (take a *happy*, long, book)

BUT... they know what they are talking about, can help you fill out the forms and may be able to help advise you one other benefits you may be able to access (such as a crisis loan to tide you over until they start actually paying you JSA &amp; HB because it will NOT be a straight away thing - it takes weeks for them to sort out.)

As a former jobcentre employee... please may I recommend not having a go at the staff, because astoundingly, it isn't actually them making your life difficult (yet) but if you make them angry/upset (trust me, they don't actually want to be there either) then they are less likely to help you.
Whilst they would never go out of there way to cause problems (not allowed, they would get fired) they can offer you a lot of help if you are nice to them.

Some will be condescending (sp?) BUT they don't mean to be. They often deal with people who are rude and unpleasant, I remember one guy threw a chair at a member of staff and a bad day in that job can be *really* bad!

You seriously think the arseholes in Westminster, Hollyrood and Cardiff should get to decide what you think and say? Okay, there are limits on free speech -- ""I'm going to come and kill you"" generally being acknowledged as unacceptable -- but, in my view, the line has to be drawn far far away from simply offending someone.

The laws are set by politicians. Politicians aren't on your side or my side. I know I sound a bit like a fringe nutter here but I don't think I am. I'm a normal bloke, with a family, a mortgage and a good job. I even stood for election on my local council once, so I've not always been so cynical about the political process or the people involved in it.

The one thing I've learnt about politicians is that all of them, even the ones who reckon otherwise, are in it for themselves. They have their ideal world view and they want to see it made it reality. They don't want to do what's right for you, they want to do what they think is right for you and then they end up getting caught up in the games power-trading, favours for mates and so on.

I'd rather have democracy than the alternatives but I'll never trust a politician with more than the bare minimum.

true,soothfast,eng-dorset,Dorset - Who's afear'd!,"Not at the moment, because the government is propping things up by paying the interest on the mortgages of people for 2 years by way of their ""mortgage rescue"" scheme (I think its 2 years).  So tax payers money is going into a scheme to keep people who have overstretched themselves in their houses.  Which some could say isn't very fair on those who are prudent, won't buy a house they can't really afford and yet their taxes are paying for those who were rather feckless.  This is why there aren't that many repossessions which is usually a historical driver for house price falls (market gets flooded with repossessions).

Personally I see it as propping up the market.

I've worked in football media and there are so many levels of 'deception' that you simply can't believe anyone if you're a fan. Newspapers and websites don't care how true a report is, they only care about how plausible and how controversial it is. Let's assume, for example, the Dempsey story is true. Fulham will undoubtedly deny it and claim that they left him behind on purpose, because it improves their position in negotiations and helps their image in front of their fans. Choosing to sell a player because it is a good deal is very different from being forced to sell a player. Simultaneously, Liverpool will send out some information to deny their involvement, because they don't want to be seen as tapping up a player. Take another example, that of Gylfi's move to Spurs. Spurs will tell Gylfi to give the media the reason that he joined because he wants to win things. This raises their prestige. Liverpool will tell Rodgers to say that he didn't feel Gylfi was worth the money, so it doesn't seem like they lost out due to footballing reasons, or couldn't afford him. It's all a matter of manipulating public sentiment. A club might sometimes bid low for a highly priced player, just to claim that he was overpriced and that market value is over inflated. This gives the picture that there is activity, even if the club had no intention to sign the player in the first place.

At the end of the day, I always look at transfer speculation in the same way I watch professional wrestling. While you know its 80% fake, there is always a hint of the truth somewhere and its a challenge to try and figure out the truth.

The doctor who missed my ankle injury is considered to be one of the top orthopedists in the UK.  When the so called 'best' are that bad, I think I can assume that the rest are far worse.

And with the prescription - *maybe* it was just the cashiers.  I assumed at the time that something in their computer system told them 'no' as I have no idea what other reason they would have for denying me the meds.

As for the stories - they are all true, and I am, medically, a horribly unlucky person all around, and I will believe that some of my bad experiences in the UK can be attributed to luck, but I have a very hard time coming to grips with certain parts of it.

For example, the psycho shrink who tried to have me institutionalized - there is NO official way to report that here.  We were advised by a lawyer to contact other shrinks, as apparently there is some sort of 'club' they have when it comes to who's esteemed and qualified etc (which makes sense) and that they would be able to follow through with reprimanding her.  The club, however, is very internally biased, and no shrink we contacted (3 post the first one) was willing or able to do anything about it.  She's still in practice.  That's not ok.  And I absolutely blame the system there.

On that same note - how the fuck can child services be allowed to go after a kid merely off of a shrinks word, with no written or hard evidence (or falsified evidence produced after we left her as patients, which is also possible)?  That's not ok either.

How can a doctor be allowed to schedule a time sensitive surgical procedure over 2 months in advance, and decide he's not comfortable performing the treatment after the patient comes to the office the day of the treatment?  Twice by the way.  Again, thats a problem with the system.

&gt;You also misattribute blame several times in your stories, if I have a negative experience with a doctor in the UK I don't turn around and proclaim the entire system is fucked, I think 'that doctor didn't know what he was on about'.


As you've seen from my stories, I've experienced more than one doctor who 'didn't know what he was on about'.  And both of the good doctors I've had (Indian's educated in America rather than Britain) agree with me that the problem is how doctors are trained and educated.  The cheapest care is not always the best care - thats the problem you get when the government has to foot the bill.

true,highd,tennant,Tennant,"The fact that Martha didn't need fixed, nor did she need the Doctor to be awesome are her best qualities. So many people are not willing to look at Martha in a deeper way. Not only was she the smartest, most capable, and useful companion, but she had to deal with much more personal emotional stuff than any of them and I think that made her like steel. 

I am not talking about her unrequited love for the Doctor, although it couldn't be fun being in love with the Doctor that was still pining over Rose. But the shear racism she had to deal with not only in 1913 but also being trapped in 1969 during Blink couldn't have been a picnic. And she was supporting the both of them. The Doctor also treated her pretty terrible and it wasn't just the friend-zoning, he was down right cold to her at times. Yes he was in pain but there was no reason for him to take her so much for granted.

None of them had to deal with what she did in anyway and while I don't think bashing the others to praise Martha, is a good thing. I feel that Martha never gets her due. Also the racism in the fandom and the hatred that people had for Freema and Martha was totally unacceptable. Freema really didn't want to leave the show after one series, that was a management decision.

The fowl, pointless stuff I have read about Martha and Freema is plain crazy.

TARDIS: Is that all you care about? Your woman?

The Doctor: My friend.

TARDIS: Oh- friend is it? And what is your idea of friendship, Doctor, I’d really like to know.

The Doctor: Friendship is, well, it- it- it’s caring for somebody more than you do yourself.

TARDIS: Fool. That’s not friendship. That’s love. Blind, heedless, love. Shall I tell you about friendship? Friendship is standing shoulder to shoulder in the face of life and death. Friendship is there when love’s candle has burned and guttered. Friendship stays loyal when the enemy is at the gate. Friendship is never sacrificed. Never surrendered. I was your friend, Doctor. Your TARDIS. Your friend-ship. How many adventures did we share? How many billions of miles did we travel together?

I do think though the question of Adam is actually 3 questions.

* Does he have a long term future at our club if we're to push on and make the top 4 and potentially challenge for the title?

The answer to this would seem to be an obvious no based on the previous season

* Can we get a good enough return on him this summer to bring in a player better suited to the system BR wants to introduce while still adding to other areas of the squad that need strengthening?

For this id suspect the answer is a no too as the front of the team still needs 1-2 more players imo and we would be extremely lucky to break even on his transfer fee this summer.

* If we sell him without replacing him is there enough depth in the squad to cover the 4 competitons we play in this year and injury to 1-2 players who play in the centre of midfield?

Looking at the current squad, Stevie, Lucas, Aquilani, Henderson, Shelvey, Cole, Suso and Spearing are all capable of playing in the middle 3.

Aquilani's future is god only knows where. Suso I would like to see in the 3 cups but id be hesitant about playing him in the league. If Joe Cole can play a full 90 minutes without looking like him may collapse from exhaustion ill take back every bad thing I've ever said about him.

But he can't do like he did at the beginning of season 6. So that leaves 2 options: Bring back Donna somehow or go get the meta-crisis Doctor. But he thinks ""Why not both?"" So first he travels to the parallel universe for the meta-crisis Doctor, and Rose comes along too. Then he tells the meta-crisis Doctor his plan to bring Donna back (put part of the Tardis inside her, then they can take that little part out later and she'll be healed and able to keep her memories, but don't ask why). They then go get Donna and do that to her. Then they go get all the other past companions (at least from the reboot). Then we can have all these characters come back from Classic Who because the meta-crisis will explain what is going to the audience that doesn't understand when he explains it to the companions that don't understand!

And after becoming trapped in Pete's World, Rose headed up Torchwood, got a degree in physics (or so I've heard, don't quote me), and helped create the dimension cannon to save all the universes without the Doctor or the TARDIS.
Don't get me wrong, I loved Martha, like I love all companions, but Rose is always my favorite. She was so ordinary, yet became so much more. Martha seemed to really push the Doctor, pursuing a relationship when what he really needed was a friend, after losing the person who had grounded him and helped him heal and whom he had fallen in love with. Plus, I know it's not her fault, but Martha seemed like she was running away from her family problems. Something I did NOT like about her though, was that she seemed almost prejudiced or something, set in a way of thinking, and it annoyed me.

The training doctors receive is independent of the NHS. The universities of the UK which teach student doctors are regulated by the General Medical Council, an organisation completely independent from the government and the NHS, and all post-graduate training is also regulated by the General Medical Council. If I chose to work in a private health care firm in the UK, I would receive the exact same training as an NHS doctor would. So don't come in here and spout your ignorance about how doctors are trained in the UK. This is not only in reference to this post, but another you made in this thread bashing the training doctors receive. Don't tar the service with something that has nothing to do with them.

First of all take everything the Daily Mail says with a bucket of salt. It is a frankly terrible newspaper whose journalistic standards are equivalent to that of a 16 year old prostitute. If you regard the Daily Mail as a reliable source of journalism; I now see why you are so ignorant. Only a few months ago was I reading a story in it about how scientists had found a cure for the common cold. LOL.

Secondly, yes people die when they shouldn't have in the NHS. And yes, NHS staff make mistakes. The moment you find me a single health care service in the world that does not have these problems I will worship you as a god among men. I damn sure know I've read plenty of news stories about the same thing happening in the USA, and there's no doubt in my mind that it happens Europe and Australia. This is NOT something unique to the NHS. I will more than likely make the wrong decision in my medical career that leads to someone dying, when instead they could have been saved if I made the other decision. This is not a problem with the NHS. This is a trait of humanity. Go build a robot civilisation if you don't want a health care system whose staff make mistakes.

Fifty Shades of Grey passes legally because of the ""literary merit"" defence. This defence was added as an amendment to the Obscene Publications Act in response to the book *Lady Chatterley's Lover*. Regardless of how terrible the writing may be, Fifty Shades of Grey is a piece of literature which focuses heavily on sex, while Girls (Scream) Aloud is a piece of slash fiction, lacking narrative.

Good Lord, how did I end up in a position where I'm defending Fifty Shades of Grey? Anyway, until somebody somewhere is successfully prosecuted for descriptions of fisting or evisceration, Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act will very much only apply to images or videos.

If Fifty Shades of Grey is indeed turned into a film, I'd be very surprised if the extreme sex described in the book is portrayed on the screen.

true,oag721,smith,Smith,"Okay, so I came into the show last year, and the first full episode I watched was ""The Impossible Astronaut"". I'd seen BBC America'a series 5 recap and knew roughly what to expect, although in that episode he seems even more strange because he is trying to act normal when he knows that there is something going on and they are keeping secrets from him. But anyway, I really fell in love with the way he was portrayed (this is why I have a little trouble with Tennant, because he's more of a bigger hero, more characters fall in love with him, and I also have a natural aversion to popular things). He is the crazy best friend, but also a father figure, as you can see in his relationship with Amy. I don't have father problems, but he seemed like the person I would want to stop by if I'm sitting in a park crying. I also love how they explores his self-loathing in series 6, because I could relate to that at the time. He has all the regret and troubles Ten has, but he keeps them hidden and you can see it below the surface sometimes, and when he talks about his self-loathing (""Closing Time"", etc) you can actually see he is disappointed in himself. I mean, a lot of this is personal stuff (same reason I love Amy, same reason I love series 5&amp;6 and complicated time travel plots and I'm sick of people complaining about it) but I think he harkens back to some of the classic Doctors, appears young and old at the same time, and is generally someone who you feel safe around. What I find the best are his speech to Amy in ""The Big Bang"" (and again with little Amelia), his actions in ""Cold Blood"" (for some reason that episode was really powerful to me the firs time, although it doesn't hold up as well on rewatch), his farewells to Amy in ""The God Complex"", and his speech to Stormageddon in ""Closing Time"".",0,1343741220,null,0,1343786838,0,c5m1eqx,t3_xfsux,t1_c5m1eqx,t3_xfsux,null,1429515415,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

I admit I might be a bit harsher on Rose than necessary around here, but it's largely in part of the fact that so many here refuse to except anything other than having inductees start with Rose, because it's 'The beginning'. This frustrates me a little as Rose is no more the beginning than The Eleventh Hour, which is no more the beginning than the 1996 movie, etc. all the way back to the *actual* beginning, An Unearthly Child. It's like skipping ~45 years of Doctor Who is acceptable, but skipping Eccleston is blasphemy.

I do agree with Blink and Vincent, though. They're great episodes, but I think they're hardly great introductory episodes.

I think ""The Big Bang"" plays this off beautifully with his speeches.

Series 6 is much darker and complex (to be honest what drew me into the show was that it was complicated, and I'm not sure I would be here if I'd watched the beginning of any other season) and it deals with loss and love and the Doctor also has a theme of self-loathing in the second half. Also, weirdly a lot of the episodes are about fathers and their children (""The Curse of the Black Spot"", ""The Almost People"", ""Night Terrors"", ""Closing Time"").

That right there, is why it won't happen. I work from home on occasion [such as today - yay for not having to deal with screaming kids on the commute home!] - under this I'd need a tv licence to own the device I use in order to do my job.

The TV licence is on the verge of becoming an outdated concept in it's current form. And I can appreciate it'll need refining, in order to take into account the changes in a more digital age. But it's hardly rocket science.

Keep the law as it is - you can own however much equipment ""capable of recording and or receiving live tv content"" as you want - if you use said equipment for the viewing / recording of live tv content, then you need a licence. If you don't, then you don't.

As for online? You can currently watch iPlayer live without having a tv licence, which is against the law.

true,TheEvilScotsman,scottish,Scotland,"I think there is some connection, yes. Scotland could be compared to Catalonia in certain regards, though Catalan disagreements with Castille are more intense because of their more recent history of outright repression practised by the latter against the former. Catalan culture was repressed under Franco, their language was not used in schools or in government offices. I'm not sure entirely but I would guess that printing anything in Catalan would also be difficult, as would making films. There hasn't been any outright oppression like that from England against Scotland for a longer time, and we don't particularly have a separate language with any widespread use since Gaelic was so effectively suppressed after the Union came into being. I don't really care about that anyway, I care that culture is weakened by fewer languages but directly I would not be affected by the number of people who speak Gaelic. I haven't found any people who mock Scottish culture being different from English, certainly not with any potency to their mock, if anything I think some English people are a little jealous of the fact that we are different.

I don't believe Scottish independence is a very smart move at all. I don't trust politicians with projects like that, and especially not the current lot, not without some sort of destruction anyway. The main reasons I don't like it as a policy though is that I care too much about the people I know to support a pointless aim which may ultimately discomfort them. I support the Union and think it has more to deliver, although it could do with some structural changes.

true,ManusDei,lfc68,,"Very good post. And it was incredibly hot in Baltimore (can't emphasize that enough), but man was that a good time. A few points of my own. I think Lucas will be fine in BR system. I don't consider him to be a long ball player. He makes sensible passes that are often not spectacular, but that is what we need. 

Charlie Adam was terrible against Spurs. You knew it was all going wrong when he gave away the opening pass (who does that...are we playing U-14 here or EPL?). I understand the logic of keeping him, but i really want him moved before his value drops any lower than it already is. He is Gerrard's match for hero balls attempted, only he converts far fewer.

Andre Wisdom really impressed me against Spurs. He completely bossed the right side of the pitch in the 2nd half. He made some great challenges and his positional play was fantastic.

Raheem Sterling does need to be loaned out. Maybe keep him as backup, but i really think he needs game time. His pace is incredible, but he did not have one finishing ball i would even consider to be below average. They were very bad crosses.

I don't know what to make of Jose Enrique either. He has been playing awful since the 2nd half of last season after such a good start to his lvpl career. Against Spurs i had to remind myself at times that it was our first choice LB out there and not some young kid getting beat and playing some very suspect passes out of the back. We really may need to sign some cover, because i want to keep Agger/Skrtel in the middle and i don't think Carra should be starting (he is a legend, but its time for a backup role).

Fabio Borini will be fine. You are absolutely right that he just needs to work the rust off.  I am hoping he gets a start in our upcoming Europa match.  Still very pleased with this bit of business.

Jonjo looks really good. His improvement is there for all to see. Your right, it wasn't a great performance against Spurs but that is fine after his Roma display. We need to keep him.

Jordan Henderson is everywhere. His fitness really is incredible, even in those conditions against Spurts. He may still need to justify his price tag, but you can't say he doesn't give 110% every time he steps on the pitch for us. That kind of effort can make up for a lot of other shortcomings, but he does have a lot of skill/potential and is young.

Eccleston needs to go. He did not impress me at all and he got a lot of minutes this preseason. Been around too long and is too old to be playing that poorly. Cut our losses and sell him and start grooming our next striker. On that note, Adam Morgan impressed for sure.

He was brought forth from a timeline that didn't involve the war. His beginnings are also very vague, but I always took him to be the personification of The Doctor's evil between his future regenerations, lifted and brought to the present. So he never physically existed in the future, but only the present(at the time).

Also, Omega and Morbius simply haven't been established as living outside the Time Lock. I don't think we should limit ourselves to The Master and Davros simply because they've been established before. I mean, at one point the same could have been said for them. ""This Saxon guy couldn't be The Master, because he's locked away in the Time War!""

And, if anything, I think Omega, and even Morbius, would be the two likeliest candidates of having survived the sealing of Gallifrey. Morbius simply because of the way he is, having preserved himself as a brain in a jar at one point, and always finding new ways to survive, and I believe even being capable of avoiding time scoops from the high council(Which means he could have been the only Time Lord to successfully avoid involvement in The Time War).

As for Omega, he's the oldest, and possibly smartest, Time Lord. If anyone could manage their way out of a Time Lock successfully, it would be him. Also, like Morbius, it's more entirely likely he wouldn't have even been involved. He's also one of the few villains, before the reboot, that would have willingly sacrificed the entire Universe by destroying the TARDIS. Dude was crazy, and without restraint.

Being British-born, albeit having lived on both sides of the pond (Atlantic) and worked for years within the realms of the international pharmaceutical industry, there is something I truly believe we do better in Europe and should thus strive in every way possible to protect: socialised healthcare and medicine. Be it the UK's massive NHS (National Health Service) or France's ""Sécurité Sociale"", as in many other European countries the healthcare system is free, or costs are minimised for all, from the point of entry to exit. This is achieved by revenue collected from taxes or payments to complimentary, private mutual insurance companies (with no shareholders and no regard whatsoever for so-called ""pre-existing conditions""). The latter are permitted to turn a fair and reasonable profit by offering individuals who choose to do so to subscribe to a policy that will reimburse almost anything that the state is not able to, e.g. some OTCs (over the counter medicines) and homeopathic and holistic treatments. This means there are contributing rather than competing interests and is why France's healthcare system is, at least to my mind in some ways, slightly better than the UK's [where the public sector is completely separate from the private sector]. Still, this is the only type of private health care I believe tolerable, as do our astute neighbours that I have had the privilege to live and work with in the past, the French. This is the way the NHS should be leaning in my humble opinion, even if it means the majority of individuals having to pay a minimum ticket of, say £10-15, to see one's GP (general practitioner or family doctor) or sacrificing a portion of the £7 flat fee ticket for any medicine (regardless of disease or cost) one buys from the local pharmacy that is subsidised by the NHS. As for the wholly-privatised healthcare system that exists in the USA, again having once been subjected to it, Michael Moore's film ""Sicko"" summed up America's perverse and callous healthcare system perfectly for me. If you haven't already, rent, stream or download it. Therein one is astonished by a seemingly-ruthless and very costly healthcare system where physicians who have taken the Hippocratic oath treat the top-tier of society to the very best of the best. Whereas the remaining Americans who are lucky enough to receive proper attention and care are left with crippling costs and treated as second class citizens. The last tier of American society is composed of individuals who are deprived of any help and compassion in their greatest time of need and seem more like 'untouchable' equivalents than recognised and embraced members of society. Thankfully, concerned individuals like President Obama are trying to change this travesty. No, I firmly believe that we, Europeans, are very fortunate to have a system of socialised healthcare and medicine that looks after all. Americans truly have a 'raw deal' and those of them who come and live in Europe learn to recognise and appreciate it all too well!",0,1343745643,null,0,false,0,c5m2ccj,t3_xcf85,t1_c5m2ccj,t3_xcf85,null,1429515922,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Pergatory,k9,K-9,"You left out one very important thing we know about The Silence: They have knowledge of future events. We know for a fact they come from the Doctor's personal future. This makes the 2nd bullet under season 5 more or less redundant, as well. However, it enforces the idea that the enemy the Doctor faces could actually be a paradox trying to ensure its own creation.

I have also long believed the Valeyard is the potential enemy. In addition to what you've mentioned, consider these extracts from two older Doctor Who stories:

From “Business Unusual”: While Lines searches for an expert, the Doctor sets off to explore the city of Brighton -- only to spot his future companion Melanie Bush walking down the street with a friend. He has been trying to avoid meeting her, knowing that if she joins him on his travels he will have taken one step further towards his destiny as the Valeyard.

From “Millennial Rites”: The Doctor asks Mel not to get involved, but his own curiosity has been piqued, and he secretly allows her to leave the TARDIS that night, knowing that she thinks she’s slipping away without his knowledge. He soon realizes, however, that by manipulating Mel into placing herself in possible danger for his own reasons, he’s taken the first steps on the path which will lead him to become the Valeyard.

It struck me as a strange coincidence that the Doctor has been doing a lot of both of these things lately. In regards to traveling with his own future companion, that doesn’t even begin to cover what he’s doing with River. One tiny mistake is all it would take to trigger a catastrophic paradox. One slip of the wrong word in the wrong time by either of them. (Which I think is why the Doctor is so intrigued by her… that she has known him for so long despite always meeting him in the wrong order suggests she has a particular capacity for not giving him too many spoilers. Otherwise her timeline would’ve unraveled long ago and possibly taken the universe with it.)

I've been saying this for ages. Couldn't agree more. There's tons of 'starting' points for Doctor Who, a lot of them at the beginning of a new Doctor's run. My own personal start point was back in the late 80's with 'Remembrance of the Daleks'. Great episode, and was a 'restart' in terms of a new companion becoming a regular (Ace), start of a new season, and start of the 7th Doctor being a bit of a bastard (if you compare McCoy's portrayal of the doctor pre and post Remembrance they're almost different characters).

true,OriginalEnough,eng-norfolk,Norfolk,"No, I can understand this. It could fairly describe my attitude so far. I thought that the Olympics were a bitter waste of money from the start. Rather, for what we were getting out of it, I thought that we were spending too much as a country. If the private investment constituted a significant proportion of the funding, I would have stayed my tongue (or fingers). I wasn't interested in the hypocrisy of the sponsorships; merely the staggering difference between what they were putting in to the event and what they were getting out of it.

I didn't intend to watch the opening ceremony, but I am so glad that I did. The atmosphere was incredible. It was tense, proud, inclusive and, under everything, humourous. From the disbelief of the Queen jumping from a helicopter accompanied by James Bond, the wonderful celebration of the British influence and influences on modern music, the celebration of our engineering and scientific legacy, to the silliness of 'Mr. Bean' and Fiji coming out to the BeeGees, I loved it. The mere fact that, at an event the world had set its eyes upon, *the British hadn't embarrassed themselves!*

For those reasons, among others, I decided to stay quiet, for now. What's spent is spent, and any attempt to derail the event (not that I can do much but moan) while it's ongoing would be foolish and expensive. I could feel proud to be British without having to feel guilty or check my enthusiasm. I was almost close enough to labelling myself English (although I do so, anyway), and joining with my Welsh, Scottish and Irish brethren and sistren to quietly encourage our lads and lasses to give Johnny and Jane Foreigner a good, fair kicking!

I still think that the sponsorship monopolies are abhorrent, along with the cost. I still think that G4S is a company that should be held accountable for their actions or inaction. I still think that the Workfare style employment and the stingy wages are terrible. I also think that it's bloody stupid that the whole ceremony set ended up in some landfill the day after the ceremony. The only difference is that I shall hold my tongue until the Games are complete.

As for the missile sites, I do understand that, were a plane to attempt to attack the Games, there would be a greater concentration of people in the stadia, so perhaps London itself might yield fewer casualties. Innocents are innocents; surely it's the number, not the name that matters. Heartless, I know, but perhaps this is an area where the heart should stick to pumping blood.

Finally, I don't entirely believe that 'grassroots' sport has been stripped of money due to one piece of anecdotal evidence: I know that my local Tennis club received funding for a new, floodlit training court under some sort of Olympic sport scheme.

I shall stay quiet until the Olympics are out of the world's eye. Mittens Romney's comments have shown me that, while I am happy to hear my fellow countrymen's criticism of our nation, I abhor foreign criticism of our internal affairs. We shall not wash our dirty linen in front of others.

The series started in 2005, before the bubble burst (in North Am, anyway), and while I get that she was working after high school, at no point did I ever get the feeling she was off to college in the fall.

As for Donna, it's perfectly plausible that she's temping only because the companies have folded, but how much longer is her job skills going to be relevant? A family friend is in the same boat as her, but older; Donna still has time to go back to school and get job security (again, if she was in Canada; there's actually a program for people who have been laid off to be re-trained for a new job).

And true, Rory *is* a nurse, which is one of the reasons I like him. When everything goes to shit, he has the skills and knowledge to pull though (like coaching Amy into re-starting his heart when he was technically dead on an alien ship). But he's not the primary companion - Amy is, just as Rose was when both she and Mickey were travelling.

**TL;DR**I don't hate any of the companions, but I do think it sends a rather juvenile message of ""Just take any part-time job you want, and your alien prince will whisk you away from it all."" 

It's traded white horses for blue TARDIS', and that's a dangerous idea, when unemployment is off the charts and those who are graduating with antiquated skill sets are finding out they're obsolete before they don the cap and gown.

The new companion needn't bee a neuroscientist, but is it too much to ask that she be involved in advertising, marketing, engineering, pharmacy, journalism, business, law, graphic design, *anything*?

I show ""Blink"" to people that are just starting the series because it's a great episode when you know nothing about the show.

My point is, if a person fears for their safety, i.e. threatened, then it is by definition a legitimate threat isn't it?

&gt;I don't want my tax money going to investigate every single case of someone being upset someone has threatened to hurt them.

It's not about being upset. It's about being fearing for your safety. People have a right to go about their lives without fear of being attacked.

And after Jack and Martha helped him save the world, they didn't expect anything from the Doctor, which was good, because they got nothing for it. Jack lost his transporter cuff as his thank you and Martha got a curt thanks.

Donna wanted to be saved, Rose wanted to be loved, Amy wanted her feelings mended for becoming ""the girl who waited"". Everyone wanted or needed something from the Doctor, and other than a wish that the Doctor would look at her with something that wasn't distain due to the fact she wasn't Rose, Martha didn't want or need anything from him.

Martha was persecuted time and time again, treated horribly by the people they met, by the Doctor, and her family. The only people that treated Martha the way she should be treated was Donna, and Jack.

I am sorry Martha/Freema was different. People in the fandom didn't like that she was black. I have read enough vitriol about them both to know this is a fact.

Knowing they have to prevent it from happening in all universes, begin the formation of a group dedicated to stopping it.

That's for the victim to decide. If the victim feels that there is a legitimate threat to, and thus is in fear of, his life and safety, then yes, it's a legitimate death threat in my eyes. The law states, as far as I can tell, that a crime has been committed as long as the perpetrator intended for the victim to fear the threat may be carried out. There doesn't have to actually be any legitimate threat to life nor does the perp at any point actually have to intend to carry out the threat. I think the law gets it right, and I think in this instance that he did want Daley to fear for his life.

4. When someone like this crops up, stick their (full, real) name, town of residence, occupation and photo on the Twat Register. For ever. Update photo and details annually, as a legal requirement.

The idea is that they're unable to shake off the Officially Sanctioned stigma of ""Twat"" for the rest of their lives. You might say the internet already does this - but people can change their names, and stories can be disputed - but this is official. 

(Jobs that require any level of responsibility could exclude people who are on the Twat Register. Fat bloody chance.)

I think her time with the Doctor, especially those 3 dreadful months where she watched over him while he fell in love with Joan, gave her real time to count her lucky stars. Yes I could see being annoyed at being rebuffed by the Doctor romantically, I just don't see that as the primary reason she left. She had to care for her family after The Master, and she knew the vacation was over.

Oh you saw selfishness, but I saw a woman that wanted attention. Given her schooling, her job, and her family issues, she seemed like she never had any of the attention, and it's sad the Doctor wasn't emotionally available at the time to see that and maybe give her some.

What a great conversation. Thank you times 10 :)

Being on the internet makes me assume that the person i'm talking to doesn't have a good understanding of what i'm saying so i often dumb things down to make them more palatable for the masses. As for the Boltzmann Brain, I actually don't know a lot about that and I thank you for giving me a new topic to learn about.

I understand.  I did an undergraduate major in physics, so I have some (limited) knwledge of the subject.

&gt;Also, I have a little note book next to my computer where i write down something impossible i see in doctor who, then leave a few pages so i can try to work out how to make it happen. So far the only thing i haven't found a way to at least partially replicate is the Time-War's 'Time-Lock' and that '2 seconds out of phase' thing that Davros used in the season 4 finale.

Things being a couple seconds out of phase has been done other times too (I think the Doctor's hidden the TARDIS that way a couple times).

The biggest issues mostly come into play with the time travel though, of course.  Given that we have no knowledge of whether time travel is even possible, let alone how it would work, it's hard to say whether Doctor Who's policy of closed loop timelines (where the events only happen because they later went back in time to trigger them knowing that they had to happen, such as everything in Blink or Amy leaving the Doctor the address in The Lodger) is at all realistic or not.  Although regardless of how time travel paradoxes would actually work, I can't imagine the Paradox generator for the season 3 finale being possible in any way.

Speaking of the season 3 finale, what about the psychic waves that the Doctor is powered up with?  That seems awfully suspicious to me.

Another aspect of this is that rural land prices are artificially *lowered* by the planning permission system, at least in many areas (green belt and all that), but artificially *raised* by EU agricultural policies (especially where the land is poor quality for farming). Agricultural businesses (leaving aside the grants) are entirely sustained by the availability of cheap oil, and the efficiencies it allows.

Of course we *could* have a re-alignment, whereby we depopulate the cities and re-populate the countryside in new settlements on poorer, cheaper land, while feeding the population domestically using more labour-intensive methods, on the better bits of land.

Personally I think EA's rating system is shit and convoluted. FM has a much more concise and efficient system. 

I hate to go on a rant here, but my pipe dream for a game would be Football Manager's infrastructure with a FIFA match engine that you could actually play in if you wanted. 

No difficulty levels and the FM rating system would improve FIFA infinitely. 

IMO by far the biggest problem with playing FIFA is the fact that you aren't really playing against differing teams; you're just playing against the same AI with different uniforms on. The difficulty scaling and horseshit non-variable AI renders the difference in player ability almost negligible. 

When Lee Cattermole is pirouetting like Iniesta and slinging 60 yarders like Xabi, it tends to frustrate. When Carlos Tevez can out-leap Marouane Fellaini you tend to scratch your head. 

There should be a mode in FIFA where the difficulty is only determined by the laws of physics and the attributes of players. It's so fucking stupid that playing Stevenage is only marginally easier than playing Barcelona. Attribute scaling is the dumbest means of increasing difficulty. Really is a joke and it's impossible to remedy with sliders. For example if you increase the rate at which the opponent misplaces passes, you might get a more realistic representation of playing in the championship, but then you'll have Xavi randomly kicking the ball out of play 20 yards away from his target if you play better teams. 

The improvements to career mode and AI suggest maybe EA will be giving a shit about offline play more, but they will never make a truly great simulation as long as difficulty scaling remains as is.

Yes, and there are little jokes you might miss out on in the new series if you haven't watched everything. However, as very few people have actually watched every episode (as there are 784 and 32 seasons) it wont do you any harm. 

&gt;can I just jump into the middle of the show?

Sure can, but I still recommend starting at the beginning of the 2005 series or at the very least at the start of one of the regenerations. ",0,1343762119,null,0,1343763157,0,c5m6seu,t3_xgp4t,t1_c5m6seu,t3_xgp4t,null,1429518018,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

**Generic Time Travel**

I went to the University of Connecticut and my physics professor was Ronald Mallet. He's been working on what he calls a 'time-machine' for a few years that's shown some promise. It's a rotating cylinder of lasers that contort space-time via a principle called 'framedragging' where space-time itself is tugged by the motion of photons. Anyway, the rotating cylinder of space-time creates a sort of time-bridge allowing you to send extremely low mass particles to travel backwards through time relative to how long the cylinder is. His model relies on the theory that time is a series of parallel timelines, where the past is set but the future is completely up for grabs. The idea is that the operator from another timeline farther in the future would send a message back through the machine and we could use that to alter our timeline. We can't change the past but we can know the future, so that's cool. He build a prototype that successfully sent neutrons back in time by about 3 microseconds. So that's cool.

**Fixed Points in space and Closed Loop Timelines**

I'm including Fixed Points in space because i'm rather proud of what i thought of. However, in order to be possible you have to assume that the universe is slowly revolving around a central point. Now, as far as we know our universe does not do that, but if it did this would be possible. The Eruption of Pompeii is a *fixed point* in my hypothesis because it releases an enormous amount of energy, which propagates outward in the universe in a sort of butterfly effect of potential energy. It's so much energy that in order to undo all of the after effects of the eruption, it would take more energy than is available in the universe. Essentially making the event permanent. This requires a revolving universe because when space-time revolves in such a way around a single, unmoving reference point it becomes a sort of 'closed loop' in which time moves normally in any individual point in the universe, but loops into itself on a vast scale. For example, if you were to travel in a space ship from one 'end' of the universe to the other, you would arrive back at earth before you left (or millions of years later depending on which direction you go.) Another side effect of that is that the future (up to a certain point relative to the size of the universe in question) is already set. So, a closed loop like the one in Blink is possible because the future has already been predetermined.

**Paradox Machine**

Can't find it in my notebook. Must have skipped it. On first glance i agree with you and don't think it's possible due to the nature of the universe and our current assumptions on time (mainly because Paradoxes don't exist in many of the mainstream theories on time).

**Psychic waves and such**

The show has this system called Archangel(?) that collects psychic energy. As it's stated in the show, it's impossible. Psychic energy is either non-existent or unmeasurable by our tech and therefore not possible at this time. However, i made the assumption that by psychic energy he meant the bio-electric energy our minds use to relay thought through individual neurons. I also assumed that this Archangel system not only harnessed the energy but converted it into some sort of usable type of energy. If the master altered the doctors age via some sort of energy, then the process would likely be reversible. This explanation really relies on a *LOT* of assumptions and isn't complete but i can account for the energy collection.. partially..

**Carrionites**

I don't think it was necessarily the words themselves that worked the science/math. I think it was more the sound-waves produced when saying the words. A professor at the University of Arizona used sound-waves to levitate a frog and i think that the carrionite 'science' would work in somewhat the same way. Oh, the 'DNA replication module' that they use in the episode as a sort of Voodoo doll could be explained via Quantum entanglement. To entangle an entire person would take a lot of energy but we have to assume they're highly advanced technologically and could do it (again assuming it's via sound waves. I know that you can entangle particles with light waves, and i think with the right frequency it could be done with sound waves, however i do Relativity and not Quantum Mechanics so I didn't look much into it.)

Right, so... this post is really long and i apologize again. Also, sorry for the assumptions. Those are some of the more difficult ones to explain..",0,1343762468,null,0,false,0,c5m6vz6,t3_xewkc,t1_c5m6vz6,t1_c5m6au2,null,1429518068,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

First you could try to go back and watch all Classic Who episodes that are available.  Not all are, and they are available from different sources. 

The most popular way to go, start off with season one of the reboot, the episode titled 'Rose'.  This is how I started.   I've heard from some that the first few episodes are a little tough to get into, and I'd agree for a first timer they can be.  I had to push through a few episodes until I was fully hooked.

Since season five started with a new head writer, new doctor and new companion, I think you could easily start there with the 'Eleventh Hour'.  Matt Smith is so much fun I think people can get hooked really easily.  There's not too much from the first 4 seasons that make it into seasons 5 and on (at least so far).  If you like, for some background, after watching episodes 5-1 through 5-3 (first 3 episodes in season 5) go back and watch 'Blink' (season 3) and 'Silence in Library' and 'Forest of the Dead' (2 parter in season 4).

(granted, at least that one introduced Davros to the new series).

I actually hope the one behind The Silence isn't Davros or The Master mostly for this reason.  One of the thins I liked about the Silence in season 5 and 6 was that they're not Daleks or The Master, who had been the main villains in every single season finale before Season 5.  If it turned out one of them was actually behind the Silence the whole time, that sort of eliminates that.  The new series needs more archvillians so that there's more surprise when a season's big villain is revealed.  The Daleks became a bit diluted, and The Master could too if he turns out to be behind The Silence.  I don't want my reaction to a season finale to be ""oh, look, Daleks/Master"" again.

Tax works remarkably similarly in that you will never, ever have 100% enforcement. There is always someone who is going to pocket a shedload by working out some clever way of evading tax. Tax avoidance schemes crop up every year devised by gentlemen smarter than you or I specifically for those like Jimmy Carr who don't want to evade tax, but minimise their tax bill legally as much as possible.

The law gets changed nigh on every year and it still goes on, and most likely will continue to go on until money doesn't exist any more.

true,manateecarbonation,null,null,"Firstly, I said that to explain that even though our US system is *broken* in the view of most people, it's still cheaper than the Brit's - which the OP was touting.  
This plan is actually pretty decent, but I'm a young, healthy male (They didn't take my asthma and allergies into account because of my employer's negotiations). These prices increase with age, pre-existing conditions, and are almost impossible to get if you're not being aided by your employer. If you don't have an employer that pays your health insurance, then you have to negotiate your own costs (yearly). After that, you may be rejected if they don't think you're worth it, or they'll charge you a ridiculous amount. I have a friend who didn't have insurance for a year or two, tried to get it for a year before he and his wife wanted to get pregnant. No company would take them on, so he just decided to pay out of pocket for the pregnancy. Granted, if you do that, hospitals will actually work with you to pay it off and give you a discount - but it's just more paperwork and effort that shouldn't be necessary.  
  
If I had never grown up with health insurance, decided not to get it for a couple years (because I'm healthy now). And I got sick, I would not easily be able to then get an insurance company to cover me. Unless I had proof that I had insurance before.( I have a formal letter from my past company stating I had insurance so that I could prove it to future insurance companies).    
  
Our system is broken because you have to know how to game it in order to make out and it is not friendly to very small companies / individuals trying to get insurance. I'm not even talking about the unemployed. My parents run a small business and it costs them a TON because they don't have the sheer numbers to be able to negotiate a good price for their 3 employees. They don't exactly make a ton of money either. (Deductible for the year is something like 5k?)  
  
Ideally, if insurance companies didn't have their fingers in doctors' practices, doctors could essentially charge less per patient, because they wouldn't have to offset the cost of everything to the insurance company. I could go into a lengthy explanation, but essentially insurance companies bloat the cost of all patient-doctor interactions.  
When it costs me 80$ for a visit to see my doctor --I don't even see one, I see a PA-- to ask about a sore throat, and they do nothing but prescribe me antibiotics after looking and being like ""oh, well try these"", it's frustrating to pay that and it makes me hesitate to visit the doctor unless it's serious. And if it is, some tests cost anywhere from $50-2000 so doctors often don't prescribe them unless you're ""high risk"". Earlier this year, I incurred a $900 charge for an abdominal ultrasound. I negotiated the hospital down (20%) because I meet their low-income requirements, but that's the flat cost of it with no insurance. If I wouldn't have spent the time to research the costs and negotiate, I would have lost 200$ because of not dodging red tape. This is part of the reason why it's broken - but also part of the reason it's not the *worst* system out there. It's just very complicated and very inconsistent. Plus costs rise every year - and have been for quite a while.  ",0,1343768512,null,0,false,0,c5m8m9q,t3_xcf85,t1_c5m8m9q,t1_c5m5mx5,null,1429518878,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt; Historical oppression does not increase the possibility of modern oppression.

Perhaps not, but it in no way eliminates the possibility of modern oppression. 

The idea is basically that historically one of the first signs of oppression of one group over another is an imposed creation of a imbalance of force. Creating a dependency of a weaker group on the strong can lead down the path of control of will by the more powerful group.

It is undeniable that this pattern of forced dependence and power imbalance has precluded many of the totalitarian regimes in throughout history. Therefore the most simple way to prevent this from happening now or 100 years in the future is to instill in your population the ideal that it is their right to be able to defend themselves against any group, including their own government.

This may not be as applicable to the United States now, but it certainly has been an important concept for nearly the entirety of its short history.

Off the top of my head you will need to pay and Parsol will deduct the following:

* Tax (have you provided parasol p45/p46, and are you on the correct tax code?)
* National Insurance
* Employers NI (I think Parasol bill this as ""Employment Costs"")
* Parsol Margin (This is Parasol's fee, you will be paying this weekly or monthly depending how your agent/agency has setup your contract with parasol)

The key to successfully taking home as much pay as possible when you are contracting/using an umbrella service is to make sure you are claiming expenses, in order to minimise your tax liability. Parasol has a great guide in their members area detailing permitted expenses and it really is incredibly easy to claim. 
If you don't claim expenses, you are throwing money away.

IF you are struggling to understand why your take home pay is so low, Parasol have a decent team that you can phone on 01925 644860 who will be able to explain things.

If you are contracting long term (over 6 months) and have the patience, discipline, and VERY GOOD record keeping skills, consider setting up a LTD company vehicle (often called a Personal Service Company or PSC). You can end up taking home more money than with an Umbrella, as you wont have their fee to pay. Consider however, the costs of a business bank account and the services of an accountant, if you are planning this route.

The Phoenix Club was the worst part of the night. Absolutely dead. We were the only people there. We arrived at about 12:30/1am. 

The girls were either orange fake bake girls, or very very small Greek girls, who looked about 17. Very disappointed. No pole shows, no interaction, the girls just stood at the bar.

Two girls took £60 for a ""stage show"" with the stag. Which involved 3 minutes of walking around the stag (fully clothed) while he sat against the pole, then they made him bend over and whipped his arse with a belt.

Waste of time and money.

The bar staff tried to scam us with a ""free"" champagne scam too. ""oh hi guys, there's 10 of you? Great I'll open a bottle of champagne for you!"" In a way that implied it was complimentary, I asked if it was free? And another member of staff admitted it was £300 a bottle.

true,Quazifuji,null,null,"&gt;I do agree with Blink and Vincent, though. They're great episodes, but I think they're hardly great introductory episodes. I think Blink largely gets recognized as a lot of people here were inducted on it, but as an actual introduction to Doctor Who it's rather poor. Vincent and the Doctor is another great episode, but kind of smacks you dab in the middle of a season.

I think they're more episodes that show off the show's quality without requiring context.  If your goal is to introduce someone to the characters and universe of Doctor Who, they're terrible choices.  If your goal is to convince someone of the quality of the show, though, then they're good.  Blink doesn't show off the show's characters at all, since the Doctor's barely even present, but if you want to convince a sci-fi fan that the show has an excellent mix of cool sci-fi monsters, clever uses of time travel, and some fairly scary moments, it's great.  It also has the bonus of beng one of the most standalone episodes of the entire series, requiring no context about the premise or characters whatsoever to watch it.

Similarly, Vincent and the Doctor's good if someone wants to show off the emotional strength of the show.  It's probably the only episode known for making people cry that doesn't revolve around the departure of a companion or Doctor, so if you think that emotional quality is what's most likely to convince someone to watch the show, it's a good choice.

Really, it depends on who you're talking to and what you're trying to do.  If a friend tells me ""I want to get into Doctor Who, where should I start,""  I'd tell them to start with either Rose or The Eleventh Hour and push them towards Rose.  If I tell someone Doctor Who's awesome and they tell me I get one episode to convince them it's worth watching, then depending on the person I might consider Blink or Vincent, and might lean away from Rose (which I think is great as an introduction to the story and premise but just not as high quality writing as the other three episodes being discussed).",0,1343773928,null,0,false,0,c5m9muq,t3_xg3ip,t1_c5m9muq,t1_c5m1ft7,null,1429519425,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

So the government (and individual counties and London Boroughs), make claims about how there is very little homelessness and what there is is being dealt with.

The paintballing was amazing. Really enjoyed it. First time going, didn't think we'd enjoy it at all, but it was brilliant: http://paintballgames.co.uk - I recommend it to all!

The Phoenix Club was the worst part of the night. Absolutely dead. We were the only people there. We arrived at about 12:30/1am. 

The girls were either orange fake bake girls, or very very small Greek girls, who looked about 17. Very disappointed. No pole shows, no interaction, the girls just stood at the bar.

Two girls took £60 for a ""stage show"" with the stag. Which involved 3 minutes of walking around the stag (fully clothed) while he sat against the pole, then they made him bend over and whipped his arse with a belt.

Waste of time and money.

The bar staff tried to scam us with a ""free"" champagne scam too. ""oh hi guys, there's 10 of you? Great I'll open a bottle of champagne for you!"" In a way that implied it was complimentary, I asked if it was free? And another member of staff admitted it was £300 a bottle.

We left after about 20 minutes.

What people aren't doing whilst looking at this story, is starting from the beginning. Who is Tom Daley? He's an athlete, who has received millions of pounds in investment from the National Lottery Foundation. Add this to the subsequent media appearances, advertising revenue, and sponsorship from corporations such as Adidas, and the kid is practically as well paid as any top footballer.

Then we'll take him to the olympics and OOPS. He's scored fourth. To anyone saying that's no big deal, it is a big deal. It would be like Manchester United finishing mid-table in the Premier League. It's extremely disappointing. The kid was one of our best shots at a gold medal, and he screwed up. Cue the media backfire! Cue the commotion!

No wait! We can't do that! We're the host nation. We can't afford to have any scandals which affect us, because we must portray ourselves as benevolent and honest. But if we can't give the people a story, they'll start forming their own opinions, and then they'll compromise our facade. *Unless*. We criticize their criticism!

And that's exactly what we've done. We've taken the words of a very unintelligent child, blown them way out of proportion, and made **that** into a national story. Because it draws attention away from Tom Massive-Waste-Of-Money-And-Misplaced-Hope Daley, but still manages to unite the people and give them something to be angry at.

I feel sorry for this poor lad. Sure, he's made some very bad-tasting comments, but he had every right to criticize Daley. Should he be arrested for bullying? Sure. But then why don't the police go and arrest Jack Highman who used to bully me in Year 6? Seems a bit of a double standard, yet again.

After City scored there was a very sporadic Poznan amounst sections of their crowd. And after we got the winner some guy in front of me and his girl started doing it. Just them, haha. 

This game was mainly a reason to make money because Oldham, being founding Members of the Premier League, entered into a pension scheme and now 100K a year (1/4 of our annual budget. No... really) is gone, and every year from now on... and it is likely to increase. Our chairman made a video and explained the situation to everyone and made us very clear how pissed off he is at this shit. 

So this was a kind gesture from City to raise some funds for our club, and it would never have happened in a million years if Dickov wasn't in charge ;)

true,Ghwyr,hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt;Why, if the NHS is so wonderful and universities are subsidized by the gov. is the UK broke and people come to the U.S. for the best medical treatment and schooling?

Why do so many Americans (and other nations) come to the UK for treatment and schooling?

&gt;All I hear is how the UK is drowning.

Who are you hearing that from? In case you hadn't noticed there is a Global recession going on at the moment. Yes the UK has its financial troubles at the moment but not any more so than the majority of countries (including the US). What does a global recession have to do with the NHS?

&gt;how can the gov. pay for most everything and still have any money at all for infrastructure, etc...?

The answer to that lies in how much they pay and for what. In the UK we pay less per head for healthcare than in the US but have a health system that's ranked #18 globally. The US for profit system costs more but is only ranked #37 Globally http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems

We can afford to continue to fund our healthcare system because we spend half as much on our military spending (per head) than the US http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures

Surviving a recession means focusing on sustainability and economic growth. Wars are expensive and don't make a lot of profit, supporting a healthcare system that is your countries largest employer and provides for a happy, healthy, and productive workforce actually makes a lot of sense during periods of economic crisis.
