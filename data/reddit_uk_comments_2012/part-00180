I don't believe there is an easily locatable list anywhere however a quick google will give you a page from the [West Midlands firearms](http://www.west-midlands.police.uk/help-advice/firearms-licensing/club-addresses.asp) licensing unit which lists ""The following is a list of West Midlands clubs who have agreed to include minimal details on these web pages"" 12 ranges, i know for a fact there are at several more not on that list - so not a full list by any means.

Furthermore (and taken from the PDF on the Wiki you are using as a source) West Midlands police have about 2000 FAC holders in their jurisdiction. The likes of Somerset, Norfolk, Yorkshire, Devon have upwards of 4000 each, most above 5000 so one can safely assume therefore that the number of licensed shooting ranges is proportional to that and say that you are looking at 20+ ranges in those forces jurisdictions alone. Multiply that by 50+ seperate police forces and the numbers are far north of those you propose and that is completely ignoring the fact that the number of licensed firearm owners is markedly lower in the UK and therefore the requirement for licensed ranges is less.

You stated that shooting is not a well established sport in the UK and that obtaining firearms or ammunition was difficult, As someone who does both and who competes across the country i can tell you that it not the case.

You did not use the word comparatively or relatively anywhere in the sentence and you were therefore making a statement not a comparison. ",0,1355758991,null,0,1355759246,0,c7hz14h,t3_14zj5u,t1_c7hz14h,t1_c7hypmx,null,1430697881,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

But the article is poorly written; it links to a piece on the Hardgreaves report which summarises ten points, but notes that if *all* of them are adopted it might add between 0.3% and 0.6% to GDP growth. This article has decided to convert that into £billions, but just link it back to tackling illegal downloading.

Take note; *this is how media lobbyists get away with murder using statistics*. Soon people will start claiming that piracy is costing the ecconomy nearly £8billion and back it up by saying the Guardian reported it.

There isn't anything to suggest the government is about to do anything different then they do now, just that the existing groups within the police what look into IP crime are being separated out into a new dedicated unit. Most likely they will continue to target websites hosted within the UK and possibly mass-uploaders. Going after everyone who downloads a song would take an immense amount of resources.

I don't necessarily think it starts with formation change but defensive style. I think we depend too much on Karacen/Tabb and Leigertwood as those defensive midfielders which ends up with us playing defense on the top of the 18 for more than half of a game. We're not bad at that but it's a strategy that is bound to concede eventually. I would really like to see an emphasis on a high line and defending from the front a bit more to see if we can win the ball in the opposition's half or force bad clearances, but to do that I think it requires a big game from Gorks and Morrison off of long balls and playing with one center midfielder who plays higher up the field. It's possible to do that with the players we have but it could end up with a very rough transition period where we give up a lot of goals. I'd like to see something like

If you just want to shoot targets, your best bet is to join the nearest club to you and attend for a few months. You'll get to use their guns, but most expect you to pay for your targets and your ammo.

After 6 months, you can apply for your own cert. By that point, you'll probably have met some people at the club and one of them would normally be happy to sign for you (if you're not a raving nutter or unsafe or something). 

The other plus side to joining a club is that you can try a few guns before deciding what to buy. You will also most likely meet someone(s) who will be happy to take you out shooting with them if you're a generally nice person. 

If you've got a SGC with guns on it, you might want to take a trip to your local clay ground and get a lesson - you might find that you enjoy that and it keeps you amused and you don't want a FAC after all.

true,Axius,null,null,"If you want to go to University, go speak directly to a University regarding a topic you want. They might say you don't have the grades, but some do run 'entry courses' that if you pass then you can get onto the degree. Especially since you had circumstances that caused you to drop out. A direct application would get you out of the UCAS system too so you'd not have to worry about that.

The reason I'd suggest something like this is because you sound pretty down about it. I know exactly how that feels and doing something productive would be a massive help to your self confidence.

Furthermore, you could consider doing voluntary work at somewhere you would like to work in future. I'm hesitant to suggest this myself because of the personal costs you could incur and the administrative nightmare that the Jobcentre would create when you try to tell them, but that's really tied to my specific experience and may be totally different to yours. You should ask the Jobcentre what their take on voluntary work is, but do NOT let them sign you up to any of their schemes as these things tend to affect benefits and if they don't suit you, you'd be stuck in them.

My local Jobcentre actually has people from igen that I have found were a great deal more useful than any unemployment scheme. You could ask to see them and talk to them about careers direction and see where you get. They have information about websites and whatnot. One such site I was given was... [this one](https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobfamily/Pages/default.aspx). The site has information about a variety of job roles you can research and see what you like the look of.

If you feel you need help with regards to CVs and whatnot, they also do that, but I have found that websites such as the Prospects.ac.uk site have very good information on that front. Try stick to UK based sites as American sites have different standards for their communication.

My overall personal advice is that you do not let yourself fall into a slump and believe that you aren't able to do anything. As soon as you do that, it shows when you go to interviews and in your applications for anything. If you think University is where you want to be, look at courses and speak to course tutors and admission tutors specifically. Admission tutors are those who will decide if you get on. They will give you the best answer and point you in the relevant direction. If that works out for you, you'd need to get student loan paperwork sorted ASAP.

true,TheJayDizzle,null,null,"ive thought this for a while, especially when we were losing and RDM would just plug in like for like with no tactical changes.

we really should be playing a 433 against many/most difficult teams:

azpi - ivan - cahill - cole: in the past alot of our width came from our full backs, and the purchase of azpilicueta seems to support the idea that we want to keep doing that. but this season especially, the wingers arent covering their attacking full backs leaving it harder for ours to make it up the pitch unabashed. 

ramires - luiz/mikel/lampard - oscar: here's where people may disagree with me. arguably oscars best position is a little deeper than he is now, and ramires a little further up. so playing luiz (lampard or mikel) deeper as a holding/releasing midfielder allows oscar and ramires to split the difference on their current positions and be able to play off of each other to build up play through luiz, using the offensive three as outlets for attack instead of winning the ball and playing it to them to set up the play as we currently do. it also releases the burden on hazmat who clearly get knackered from tracking back and forth so much, by having oscar and ramires able to shift from inside to outside to cover overlap easier. 

mata(moses) - torres - hazard(marin): so as i said. the wingers having to track as much as they do ends up in staler attack and defensive lapses. im not saying they're bad, or that they wont do any defending in this system, because of course they will, it just has more of a safety net/allows for more resting. this makes it so they get the second ball, opening up for shots and setting up torres, without having to come from  practically midfield on a counter.

true,elburrito,devon,Devon,"&gt; Unfortunately the flaw in that logic is that guns (particularly those permitted in the US) are marvels of engineering that allow the weak to wipe out dozens of people within a minute with no effort, and in a confined space they require only minimal skill.

ahahahah
the real logical flaw is on your part, not on fact_hunt's. let's take 2 countries that have similar per-capita gun ownership like the states and see how many shootings they've had.

Switzerland has had 4 shootings / ""rampage killings"" in the past century.  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rampage_killers:_Europe  

Canada has had 4 shootings / ""rampage killings"" in the past 90 years.  

The United States has had so many shootings / ""rampage killings"" that it's hard to find the other countries on that list as ""U.S."" completely saturates it.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rampage_killers:_Americas  

The most common weapon in Switzerland is the Sig 550 ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIG_SG_550 ). Weapons that can be legally bought in the States can be legally bought elsewhere too, certainly in the two countries I'm comparing them with. Hell, here in Germany I can legally buy weapons that are illegal or hard to come by in the States. 

It's quite clear that another factor than ""AHMERGERD BLACK RIFFEL ASSUALT DERTH MARCHENES"" is the cause.

your logic, that ""killing machines"" make people kill, is severely flawed. also, your assumption that only just now in modern times have guns been particularly lethal, is laughable at best. please educate yourself on the matter instead of blurting out irrational assumptions.",0,1355770602,null,0,1355770801,0,c7i23ri,t3_14zj5u,t1_c7i23ri,t1_c7hwf6x,null,1430699325,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

There are however some teams that play with a DM that is not a destroyer. Arteta or Pirlo for example. We could maybe try this with Lampard holding with Oscar and Ramires in front. Thisould take a considerable amount of chemistry building that we.don't really have time for.

Whatis likely to happen though is that Rafa will continue to execute his plan. Hazardand Moses will be firstchoice wide players. They will play very verydirect.

*During operation, a distinctive grinding and whirring sound was usually heard.* *(TV: An Unearthly Child et al) River Song once demonstrated a TARDIS was capable of materialising silently, teasing the Doctor that the noise was actually caused by him leaving the brakes on.* (TV: The Time of Angels) *However, River could have been fibbing as other newer TARDISes, flown by other pilots (such as the Master and the Rani), made the same sound in the course of their normal operation,* (TV: Colony in Space, The King's Demons, Time and the Rani) *as did the Doctor's when piloted by other Time Lords* (TV: The Claws of Axos, The Pirate Planet). *The Minyans' computer recognised the sound as associated with Time Lord ships.* (TV: Underworld) *The Doctor himself also materialised his TARDIS more than once without making the distinctive noise.* (TV: The Dalek Invasion of Earth, The Impossible Astronaut)

This sound was also made by other devices: SIDRATs, a craft similar to TARDISes used by the War Lords (TV: The War Games); a Time Lord who appeared to the Third Doctor (without using any visible means of transport) to warn him of the appearance of the Master (TV: Terror of the Autons); when the Time Lords provided the Third Doctor with a new dematerialisation circuit, it appeared on a table making this sound. (TV: The Three Doctors); and when the Fourth Doctor modified Skagra's invisible spaceship to travel like a TARDIS, again, this sound was heard. (TV: Shada)*

They had failed her. They had failed the country. The country she held so dear to her heart. For Elizabeth was not merely the queen of this one realm. But the government of this, her home nation had disappointed her so. It was time for a change she thought.

She licked her lips, and took a deep nasal breath, remembering the day when she last smelled the blood of her victims. So long ago in Zimbabwe. Her second breath brought a different memory though. What was that odour? Gunpowder? No, more subtle that that. Liquorice? Nearly... Elizabeth surveyed the room, slowly taking in the mental panoramic of the glorious dead, then there it was. The lone survivor.

""Fear."" Elizabeth mouthed. That was the smell. The lone politician cowered. Hiding behind the bodies of so many fallen. he sobbed slightly. Elizabeth was not amused. ""Arise, whelp."" the monarch said. ""Is this how you wish to die? Clutching the bloated corpse of Kenneth Clarke? Arise, and accept your fate.""

The politician pushed the body aside and slowly stood up. Still sobbing. She had not seen sobbing like this since Charles announced his divorce. A young, clean faced man stood before her. Awaiting his fate. ""What is your name?"" Elizabeth hissed. 

""Clegg ma'am. Nick Clegg""

""So, Nicholas. Did you really think you could escape? Are you not aware who I am? Are you not aware of my power? I, Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of your God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Queen, Defender of the Faith! Did YOU believe you could escape ME?"" Clegg fell to his knees. His fearful sobbing turned to pathetic begging for his life.

""Mercy!"" He pleaded

""NO."" Stated the monarch. ""Your words are nothing to me. I will show you my Mercy."" She lifted her sword high. The small square blade slowly extending in the dim Downing Street lights, as if by a darker power. The stub became a blade. The blade became an edge, then she struck the blow.

Cleggs head slumped from his neck. Blood sprayed across the room. Elizabeth could literally taste Cleggs life draining from his useless flesh. She sheathed the Sword of Mercy. Lifted the head of the final politician and headed for the door.  

Hordes of people were in Downing Street. Cameras, reporters, from every possible news outlet. The Queen held the head of Clegg aloft, triumphantly.

My friend bought a house 18 months  ago. In that time the boiler has packed up, he's just spent £3,000 having the roof and ceilings fixed plus the flat roof on the bay window. All of which would have been done by a Landlord. 

We bought this house 2 years ago. First winter and we needed to replace french doors, (£900), electric shower (£150) and all the kitchen unit doors (£500). This last 12 months the boiler has gone twice (£300), leaking flat roof (£200) and the laminate floor in the bathroom has started to lift plus the seals on two double glazed windows have gone.  All barring the last would have to be repaired by the Landlord.

&gt;  you have no guarantee you can stay in your home as long as you want if you are renting, unlike those who own theirs.

You have more chance of staying in your home if you lose your job than someone who owns theirs. You'll get LHA/Housing Benefit. They'll get fuck all for the first 3 months and then will only get interest paid for the first £200k at a rate of 3.63% but that is only for the initial mortgage so if they've remortgaged for any reason or the house is worth more than £200k they won't even get enough to pay the interest so a year down the line they'd be facing repossession as well as £1000's in late fees/penalties and additional interest which you won't.

&gt;  There is also the lesser issue of deposits, which landlords will often keep with very little recourse available to the tenants.

You what? The law is massively weighted in the tenants favour in regards to deposits. If the Landlord doesn't put it in a registered deposit scheme, the tenant can sue the landlord for four times the deposit amount just because of that regardless whether or not they get it all back at the end of the tenancy. And if the LL tries to withold the money, there is a dispute service which usually favours the tenant.

The only positions we are deep in are attacking mids and centre backs, and we do not fully exploit the former.

Lukaku can definitely fight for the lone striker spot and could possibly play better than Torres there thanks to his overall strength. It seems Torres wants to play like a target man, holding up play, pushing off defenders but he is not suited for that. He lacks the strength and physical presence that playing that role requires, but Lukaku has it.

However - I will point out that a US passport will get you into a lot of places in the world.  Further, it secures access to consulate services - and should things go badly wrong, the US armed forces have a mandate to retrieve US citizens from war zones.  If you get mixed up in (accusations of) criminal activity, then the US government has an interesting in seeing justice done properly, which is useful in the event of false accusations. If convicted, there is a good chance that the US government can arrange for the sentence to be served in a US jail (which can be significantly better conditions than parts of the world).  Finally US passport holders have a right to travel and work in the USA (i.e. rescind it, and visits home become much more problematical).

Most of the above is probably not of much interest to British citizens; as a British passport covers much of the same.  However, I would urge one to compare it to the passport from, say, Congo (to pick a less influential nation at random).

true,Silent_Ranger,null,null,"At this point we have two strategies in the transfer market and moving forward as a team:

1) Build a team around Suarez, buy pacy wingers (1 or 2) who can stretch the field and provided width as well as work rate

This is the strategy that Barcelona are currently using by starting Sanchez and Pedro over Villa, they both offer more defense and width despite a lack of goals but when you have Messi you don't need goals from your wingers.

Players that we've been linked with in the past seem to fit this billing (Walcott, Sturridge etc.)

2) Buy a quality central striker who can convert *shots* (not chances) into goals and push Suarez out wide into a creative playmaker role, we would need a creative RW to pull this off effectively

This is the strategy I would like to see us use in the future because I remain unconvinced that Suarez can improve his shooting accuracy (10 goals in 96 shots is the worst in Europe for players with 8+ goals this season).

There are a number of players we could look at, for strikers the following players could fit the bill: Huntelaar, Adam Szalai, Soldado, Negredo, Pablo Osvaldo, Cavani, Higuain, **Wissam Ben Yedder** (I really like this kid), Steven Fletcher, Rodrigo Palacio

As far as creative wide players there are also a few options: Leo Bapistao, **Iago Aspas**, Adel Taraabt, Valbuena, Max Kruse, Foued Kadir, Andre Schurrle, Jefferson Farfan, Lamela, Reus

Obviously some of these (Reus and Lamela in particular) are not very likely targets but this is just to show that there are players out there that we can sign in January who would add to our squad in noticeable ways that wouldn't break the bank

Ultimately the question remains whether we can turn possession into possession in the final third and then into goals. I believe that we can given time. Additionally Borini is close to returning and the more I look at him the more I realize he is the exact type of player we need. Regardless of which strategy Rodgers chooses he will bring in at least 1 attacking player in January to bolster the attack and give Sterling and Suso a bit of a break. If we are able to sell Downing and Cole as seems to be the plan then we might see 3 or 4 signings coming in. 

What seems to be the frustrating thing for most everybody is the fact that while we recognize that Liverpool are not quite a competitive team the league is so close that it seems like we could jump right up into CL contention. This is not the case, we are not capable of that yet because as we will all see Tottenham and Chelsea and eventually Arsenal start to pull away from the pack and perform as they were expected to play at the beginning of the season. We really should have a target of 65 points not one based on league position because this will give us an indication of how strong we are as a team on a more objective scale (because over the past 10 years 65 points could land you anywhere from 4th to 7th). Obviously our long term goals are not points based but whether we can qualify for CL or win the League, but for the moment this is a better indicator of our progress.",0,1355783418,null,0,false,0,c7i66aq,t3_14wlq1,t1_c7i66aq,t3_14wlq1,null,1430701242,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,free_at_last,null,null,"I have found a few things out. I originally did not have any qualifications in development at all.

This however, is only a setback, but not a setback that cannot be overcome.

Teach yourself. It's perfectly possible. 

Also remember that a lot of uni degrees may not be what you think they are. A lot of people seem to think Computer Science is essentially a development degree. It isn't. So people get pissy when they don't get much development experience out of it. The point is that uni will not always necessarily go into as much detail as you'd expect.

Through my travels so far, I have found that C# &amp; ASP.NET are very very popular here. You definitely see PHP and Java jobs scattered, but at least I have found C# can take the cake for most of the web development jobs.

The great thing there is C# and ASP.NET are great languages. They are very easy to learn. You'll always get different ideas about what are the best beginner languages, but I personally think C# is brilliant all round. Once you get the concepts down, you'll find it very fluent and easy to understand.

A word of warning, you will need to prove yourself in a different manner since you don't have any qualifications or experience. By this I mean, learn the language yourself, and go and build a few things. Make your source code public (Gist or Google Code) so you can show recruiters and potential employers, and build whatever you can. 

A lot of graduates fall on experience anyway, so I wouldn't worry about it all too much. A bit of dedication, show the employers what you have or can make, and you'll be OK.

If you take C#, Visual Studio Express is free, so you can download that and get started.

If you wanted a qualification, you could take a Microsoft .NET certification.

I had no university degree or experience, but got a few projects together in a few different languages (Python, C# and C++, mainly just to prove I had diverse knowledge) and I got a few responses.

You'll start at the bottom of the pack, but that's OK. Why? That first job you get will be absolutely vital to you carrying this on as a full career for the rest of your life. So you should not expect a £30K a year junior development job.

true,ProtoKun7,smith,Smith,"The transfer wouldn't even need a retcon; it was never clarified if it added more or not. It would make sense, given that River had plenty left and transferred all of that energy.

The Time War suggestion works too; the Master was given a new cycle of regenerations to fight, so it's not too big a stretch to conclude that every Time Lord fighting received new cycles in order to prolong their lifespans to fight.

I don't think it was simply a law, though. The evidence suggested it to be biological, or at least more than just a law saying ""don't do it more than this"", because of examples like Azmael, who regenerated a thirteenth time to purposefully destroy himself, and even the Master. Had it simply been a law then the Master would have easily flaunted it. Some piece of technology tracking every Time Lord and physically limiting them is more likely than that but still unlikely given certain pieces of dialogue.

I'd actually be content with the explanations of River's transference and/or receiving more to fight in the Time War. They need to address the limit properly and give even a simple explanation like that which will give plenty more regenerations, not just handwave and ignore it.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"This is a fair point, I think its worth going into a little detail as to why the situations differ. Your influence is lacking significantly compared to the Barclay brothers. If you don't get what you want the MP might loose a few votes at best. If the Barclay brothers don't get what they want they don't pay for campaigns in contested seats, this could be the difference in an election.

People will use their influence, else what is it for, I cannot take exception to people expressing a political opinion. The issue I take is that this isn't public and open so we the voters can't see how our politicians are influenced by those who are acting in their own interests, not the interests of the country. We don't know who funds lobby groups, who they pay, what jobs they offer to ministers when they leave office.

Do you think that the Barclay brothers, and their type, have the interests of our nation in mind when they use these dubious means to demand tax loop holes from governments? To me, any argument made appears to be a justification for selfish interests after the fact rather than any moral conviction that this state of affairs is beneficial to the world.

You can then slowly acquire skills in the more ""serious"" things like proper programming.

If you think about Stoke, you know you're going to need to be sharp defending set pieces, and you know you're going to find it easy to control possession. A 3-5-2 gives you a numerical advantage in central midfield and an extra big man to defend set pieces, all without sacrificing a forward. The weakness of course is the wide areas but against a team like Stoke who don't have a lot of pace to get in behind your wingbacks it doesn't matter a hell of a lot.

You think you are being smart, but actually you are being a bit stupid and your condescension is grossly misplaced. Read the following carefully:

&gt; There were 562,696 shotgun certificates on issue on 31 March 2012, a fall of 0.3 per cent from the 564,269 on issue at the end of March 2011. **The longer-term trend since 2002 in shotgun certificates is relatively flat.**

&gt; certificates (464,839 firearms) increased and is the highest number since these figures were first collected in 1995

You also are probably misreading that. FACs fell, number of guns increased, so that more than suggests that slightly fewer gun owners just bought more guns. You also have to correct for population growth.

My point is that CDs actually cost something, there's something to charge for. Digital downloads don't cost anything, there's just a few electrons whizzing around. No physical materials involved in the production.

If I go to a restaurant, eat something nice and the next day make the same thing at home, is the restaurant losing potential revenue? Am I stealing from them?

Add this to the fact that they had an extremely limited budget, and the first few episodes can be ""challenging"" to take seriously.

Please believe me that it does get much, much better. I'd still suggest ""Rose"" is an important episode to watch though, just because it establishes the characters (especially Rose herself).

true,elburrito,devon,Devon,"maybe if you're from the States Switzerland has strict laws in comparison. Switzerland has, as I've stated before, incredibly liberal gun laws. This isn't up for debate - it's a matter of fact. You're welcome to compare individual gun laws in europe and show me your findings. if you actually reach the conclusion, that the swiss laws are not one of, or even the most liberal in europe I'll eat my hat.

open carry and concealed carry are generally very diffilcult licenses to acquire in western europe. usually open carry is reserved for active police officers and military personell. concealed carry is granted to police, bodyguards and citizens who can prove they are in heightened danger. thus, yes, you are correct; almost everywhere in europe you have to enclose your weapon when transporting it. this, within the gun community, is what we call a ""no shit sherlock"". you have rights and privileges, but you certainly have duties too.

you're incorrect in your statement, that the only way to acquire guns in Switzerland is to have served in the army. you have the option to retain your service rifle post service. it's encouraged but not mandatory (anymore). legal gun ownership in switzerland encompases, but is not limited to, sports shooting, (post) military service and hunting.

calling for a person to educate themselves, when it is unmistakenly clear you do not have the competence, is the height of bad debate etiquette and hipocrisy. I'm sorry that the truth of matters apparently offends you, but it's not my responsibility.

After the actress that played Romana left the series, they recast her (using one of the main actresses from the previous serial).  They dealt with this in an interesting way.

The Doctor (Fourth) sees Romana II, who has just regenerated, as she grew tired of her previous incarnation.  The Doctor insists she can't do this, as that body already exists.  So Romana II parades a few different forms before regenerating again back to Romana II.

(I hope this makes sense.  If not [Here's the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYV_BcdPrdo))

This implies that regeneration can be willed, to a point. If there is a low limit to the amount of regenerations they have, i don't see why she would so casually do this.

I've read some interesting things lately about this subject. My opinion seems to be waving towards this, during the troubles, Unionists had a notion of having everything handed to them on a plate (To what level of truth this is, I'll leave it up to you.) Nationalists on the other hand, had to generally work harder to get things that they were equally entitled too.

This led to Nationalists having a better drive to achieve higher education levels, because if they didn't, then how would they ever make a living. Now when Nationalists are outdoing their Unionist counter parts here, the Unionists are pissed because they still feel a right to be spoon fed. 

They feel as if they're government is turning on them, and if the police get very tough on them, what would happen?
They've been rioting now for too long over 1 bloody flag being removed from a single building. Any  person would shrug there shoulders and say, 'Didn't even really notice it there, but the council voted and their you go'. But no, the loyalists involved felt like they're being forced to reject their 'Britishness'. Just imagine what would happen if they then start feeling that their Police are now trying to take away their Identity as well.

I genuinely think these view points are, for lack of a better term, insane. But I do believe these people believe at some level these things. However those that are left at these 'protests' may just be the disenchanted youth screaming for a reason to throw a rock.

 This mentality has to change, people have to realise that although they may be part of N.I and the U.K, everything here is different, they can't act the same, they exist in a world of exceptional circumstances, and they have to really get over this. 

Same thing goes for the park in Newry. Obviously he is a terrorist to some people, it doesn't matter what your own opinion is on it. Here, we have to stop pondering over issues like this for too long. If it's going to offend one side or the other, you leave the issue. Unfortunately we're not mature enough yet as a society to accept another sides view point and remember those who died in a fitting way.

So I think the PSNI are probably doing all they can without making the situation worse. I'd like to see them take every single last one of them who are violent and put them away, but I don't think it would do any good.

That's just 10, though. No other Doctor has remotely come near comparing regeneration to death - Eccleston's even called it a way of cheating death. Everything 10 said about regeneration feeling like dying, I attribute to that particular incarnation of the Doctor, not something that speaks for the Doctor on the whole.

I don't want to bore anyone with the technicalities, but BitTorrent uses two kinds of traffic, normal HTTP traffic which won't look too different from a web-request (e.g. accessing Reddit.com), and a Peer Protocol which doesn't depend on any single source or destination port.     

It is possible to block, but you need to do something called ""deep packet inspection"" (which means analyse the content of a packet) which is quite expensive and potentially a massive invasion of privacy. Virgin Media has somewhat rolled this out, but I believe their implementation depends on overall throughput in order to determine who to inspect, in order to find BitTorrent (i.e. they don't inspect everyone all of the time).    

If an ISP wanted to block BitTorrent peer protocol all of the time then they would likely need to spend tens of millions on equipment to do so. Additionally BitTorrent supports encryption and obfuscation techiques specifically designed to bypass such blocks.

Gay couples in civil partnerships can, and do use adultery as the basis for a dissolution all the time, it just comes under the standard of ""unreasonable behaviour"".

The legal test for the circumstances, and the steps taken are EXACTLY the same, its just a different word is used. There is no reason whatsoever either term couldn't be used, to exactly the same effect. Its irrelevant legal semantics, of interest to no one but lawyers.

I would add that the reason infidelity was not included as grounds for civil partnership dissolution explicitly, was solely because of complaints about making it too much right marriage. . That is not the doing of gay rights campaigners, its entirely the result of the mucky little compromise with religious antagonists that CPs were. This would not be true of marriage.


The non-consummation issue is a red herring. Annulments are incredibly rare in the UK. They take a very long time,  are extremely expensive and are incredibly challenging to get. They are unconnected to the issue of religious annulment, which needs to be awarded separately. Moreover civil partnership ARE eligible for the majority of annulments based on the other, more likely reasons: mental health, coercion, defective paperwork, bigamy. Its actually entirely possible that non-consummation is, in the average year, entirely unused as a basis.

Take my dads example, he was on the heart transplant list in the late 90's and missed a heart because he basically missed a phone call telling him to come to prep. The person who got that heart died a couple of days later from rejection. My dad eventually got a new heart and it gave him five years more life but, if he'd got the first heart the chances are he could have died a few days later from possibly the same rejection the recipient suffered. 

I will add that my dad eventually died from a complication with the immunosuppressant drugs not because his new heart gave in, basically they need to stop your immune system working for the heart to not reject.

true,Darkblitz9,null,null,"The point of the Id and the ego is that the Id is more based on carnal, instinctual and sexual desires rather than logic. You mean to say that the Rudy we see most often doe not represent the Id?

I understand your argument and Rudy 3 (the dead one) does show that he has emotion and that he does get enjoyment from hurting people, but it's not his main shtick. The point of R3 is that he's cold, methodical, determined, and logic driven. The candy is representative of that, because to him, the candy is meant for him and the other two. Most people would throw those away, but he's a logical mind: Three candies, three Rudys.

The point I'm getting at is, all three of them have a full range of emotion and can act on carnal desire, morality, or logic (the id, super ego, and ego respectively). The focus is: which portion of the psyche do they most closely represent. Rudy 1 is focused on carnal desires. Sex is his way of live, he does all he can to fuck and doesn't care for much else (until recently) So he'd most closely represent the Id. Rudy 2 is shy, kind, tries to help others, and focuses on staying out of trouble. He would represent the super ego (which we agree on) as morality and a conscience is his main driving point. While Rudy 3 (deceased) is careless, logical, methodical, and intelligent. He'd mostly resemble the Ego, which is based on logic.

Here's an example though: R1 sees a hot but annoying girl. R1 thinks: ""I wanna fuck that."" That's a carnal desire, the ID of a psyche. R3 sees the same girl and thinks: ""She won't shut up, I'll just to kill her to shut her up."" It's logical, completely immoral, yes, but logical. He wants her to shut up and killing her is one way to do that. That's exactly what he did to the DJ.

I personally don't see how you can make the connection that R3 is the Id and is focused on carnal desires when then entire time we see him he never wants the #1 carnal desire: sex.",0,1355832305,null,0,false,0,c7igw87,t3_14zjwb,t1_c7igw87,t1_c7icvcg,null,1430706557,1,false,misfitstv,t5_2s8pg,1

I think this rumour is probably false and spread maliciously to boost opposition to same-sex marriage, but we have seen people in the press, including gay rights activists, saying it will be open to legal action.

This is why the government is making such an effort to draft the law so it's watertight.

1 took several months to find work and did about ~5 months ago. I attribute this mainly to him only being in place for a handful of months before we went down the pan. It's easy to attribute that to job hopping even if administration is clearly marked on a CV.

1 found a new job 2 months ago - although she took the decision to take 6 months off for personal reasons.

I think because our field was so specialised it may have been less difficult. Also due to living in/around London there are plenty of jobs.

true,Lit-Up,null,null,"&gt; This mentality has to change, people have to realise that although they may be part of N.I and the U.K, everything here is different, they can't act the same, they exist in a world of exceptional circumstances, and they have to really get over this.

How are they going to realise they need to get over it and have a change of mentality if they can riot with impunity? If anybody tried to kick off like this in London, the police and the courts would be down on them like a ton of bricks. In the London riots, they set up special 24 hour courts in order to ensure everybody was charged with offences. No, that wasn't internment. It was running people through a criminal justice system that is both a deterrent and a punishment. It seems like these loyalists have neither deterrent nor punishment for their actions, just police trying to prevent further damage and then wider society praying that they will magically stop. It wouldn't have worked in London, it's not working in Belfast and elsewhere.

When people remark that it's just over a flag, they are missing the point of this. It is a superficial observation to note that ""they feel their Britishness is being eroded"". The more profound fact is that these selfish, bigoted neanderthals reject wholesale the idea of equal citizenship and a shared society. They're like entrenched white South Africans. They spend their time hating on others rather than improving themselves, and then assume that they're not being given enough. 

People call the Shinners political troublemakers; they hardly tabled a motion to have the tricolour flown as well, which would be the truly equal situation and a not unreasonable one! They just suggested that no flag was flown, which is actually quite a diplomatic move. Alliance then made a compromise motion of designated days and Sinn Fein voted for that. The DUP, rather than stoking tensions to get the seat off Alliance could have sold this as a victory for unionists who made Sinn Fein vote for the union flag to be flown at all. 

In London there are people of all shades of religion, and this kind of xenophobic bigotry is only mirrored by the BNP. Loyalists are the worst example of humanity in Western Europe; would anybody on the islands of Great Britain or Ireland miss them if they got deported?

It's a radical redefining of the idea of marriage.

Historically, marriage (an institution which predates the modern nation-state and organised religions) has been defined as that relationship between a man and woman within which sexual intercourse leading (generally) to the birth of children would take place. 

By removing adultery as a basis for divorce in same-sex ""marriage"", the advocates of this novel redefinition are revealing that the thing they are creating is *not* in fact marriage, since no sexual intercourse can take place within it.  

By all means, create a legal framework that allows same sex couples to express lifelong commitment, and grant legal rights to one another. But why confuse the issue by calling it ""marriage"" when the proposals themselves clearly reveal that such a contract is not and can never be ""marriage""?

Swansea gave us a great demonstration on Sunday of what could be done with players who aren't the best but who play as a team. Often they passed rings around us, while we gave the ball away with poor control or poor positioning. If we had that team work with our players it'd be unstoppable.

Its one of the raft of activities considered to constitute unreasonable behaviour. As is denial of sexual relations.

Denial of children, I would note, however, is not, and never has been. Such a divorce would have to take place on the grounds of 2 years separation. The law at present does not see that the provision of children is a necessary component of a marriage. It does however see that sexual fidelity, where it is expected by the partner, is a necessary component of civil partnerships, and will do the same of same sex marriages, just as it does for heterosexual marriages.

Adultery, inasmuch as it is sexual infidelity, IS a reason for dissolving a civil partnership. It just doesn't use that terminology. 

Same sex couples are perfectly happy to use the same terminology. The circumstances within the relationship differ no more from heterosexual marriages than the amount some heterosexual marriages differ from each other. 

Finally, if you believe that children should be raised within a marriage, why do you believe that same sex couples raising children together should not be permitted to do so within a marriage? 

Do you believe parents who adopt should have no right to marriage? Or step parents? Or those who use a surrogacy?

Given this whole back lash is simply about homophobes being upset gay marriage is going to be a thing regardless of if they them self's have to actually perform it you can understand why some groups would be hacked off that CoE/W effectively gets a free pass on the issue for their denomination and they don't.

People often don't realize, but the marriage part is the bit where the registry/book is signed. All the guff beforehand, be it vow, blessings or whatever: That could be anything, though I *think* some sort of vows must be said? It would make sense, but I imagine it's along the lines of ""Do you? Yes. And you? Yes"".

If you don't sign the book then you're not married, according to the state (sfaik). The French system makes this clear: You can have any religious ceremony you want (if they let you) but you *have* to have a civil service as well (or just that), otherwise the state doesn't recognize your union.

Incidentally, the [Marriage Act 1836](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act_1836) freed the ceremony from having to be Anglican. For a number of decades before that, if you wanted to be married in the eyes of the state then you had to do it in a CoE building by a CoE minister, apart from Jews &amp; Quakers.

The Act allowed other religious groups (e.g. Catholics) to have their own weddings formally recognized without having to have a 2nd (CoE) ceremony. It also introduced registry offices, whereby people can get married in a secular/non-religious fashion.

Let me play Devil's Advocate, from my Alan B'stard alter-ego's POV:

Alan's problem is that recording TV and lending CDs reduced profits, but it was awkward to do, so it didn't do enough to make too much of a difference. But piracy now is easy. (Personally, I've downloaded a film simply because it was quick, easy and I didn't feel like paying when I didn't have to and wouldn't get caught. But judging from Reddit, I'm the only one who has ever done this) 

Tech savvy people will always find a way to circumvent it, but as long as it's not trivial to do, you reduce the number of pirates to a more managable level. So if Alan makes torrenting awkward, that's good enough. (If I had to jump through hoops to download a film illegally, I'd probably just shrug and get it legally)

Yes, the media companies could do a lot more to make their content easier to pay for, and in time, one innovative firm will start doing it and every other will follow the money.

Edit: I cannot believe that people are presuming to lecture me on something so simple as this. 

The term ***Dominion*** is no longer in use. It was an official term in the British Empire, denoting a country that, while titularly independent, were *under the Sovereign of the United Kingdom*. That is no longer the case. The Commonwealth Realms (the term that replaced Dominions) are of equal standing with the United Kingdom. Dominion is a subordinate term. 

 The Crown exists as a separate legal entity in each Commonwealth Realm. Queen Elizabeth is both Queen of Canada and Queen of Australia, but the titles exist independent from each other (this is the reason why all Commonwealth Realms had to ratify the recent changes to succession, allowing first born children regardless of sex to inherit the throne - were we still Dominions it would not have required the ascent of each country). 

See, for instance, the British North America Act, which granted Canada independence from the UK. 
&gt;""Whereas the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick have expressed their Desire to be federally united into One Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom.""

Canada is not any longer ""under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland"", it has its own Crown, the Crown of Canada (there is no physical crown, but the title exists independent from that of the Crown of The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland). You could oust the monarchy, and it would be up to Canadians to decide if we wanted to oust them as well. Or not. This is guaranteed by the Balfour Declaration and the Statute of Westminster. 
 
I am a fervent Canadian Monarchist, but it is important to understand the nuances of terms. I am, by no means, denying that Elizabeth II of Canada is my Queen (I, oddly enough, have a portrait of her hanging in my bedroom) - but the Queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is not my Queen.

Perhaps we should ban forks too. They can be bloody dangerous!

Don't get me wrong, if I could as easily go to a website and just watch the TV shows I wanted, as easily as I can go to the piratebay or eztv and get them, I would, but that often isn't the case.

I happily use the BBC iPlayer, or well, I did, until I moved to Portugal, but since I found out about Tunlr, I have begun using it again, as well as Channel4's 4OD, because they are the easiest ways for me to watch random shows - When there's something I want to watch that they don't have, I happily pop back to the pirate bay, because I know it will be there.

Until the day comes where you can find whatever you want legally through Google in under a minute, pirates will exist. You want to block torrents? Just use Google to search for a way around it. If they blocked torrents it would be big news a long time before it actually went into effect. Most people that use torrents would find their preferred work around long before the block even came into effect. Even if they didn't, a quick Google search would yield results to get them back on their way once it came into effect. You can be sure that somewhere, someone would find a way around it, and share it online for all to use.

It doesn't matter what way you try to block it, unless you literally cut people off from all internet access, you're always going to be just a google search away from finding a solution. The only thing you're hurting are legitimate businesses - for example a business that distributes it's software through torrents, probably through the software's installer, or launcher. Your average user doesn't even know it's using torrents to download the data. This company then has to change their distribution method, potentially incurring huge fees in bandwidth, because they have to provide their software somehow, and in a way that doesn't involve circumventing the law. There's a bunch of big games that do this, and oh so much free software that do this. They'd be getting totally screwed.

Or, in other words, the Pay-to-win model.


I don't know the original goals or aims of making WoW, but it differs from the Pay-to-Win model quite a bit. While there has slowly been an increase on things you can spend real money on in WoW, it's all cosmetic. The monthly fee is a common occurrence in this type of game, and isn't unheard of in other areas of gaming, or entertainment in general.

Do I think they're trying to milk it for all they can now? Pretty much, but your comment wasn't really true. It's not like you can get addicted to WoW, and spend £100-200 or more in a single day on it because you are addicted to it. It's always £9 per entire month. Of course, you can get multiple accounts, or buy the vanity items that exist, but there are only a handful of those, there's simply far less ability to throw money into it (and less ingame gain) than there is the facebook games, where they offer increasing amounts of ""bonus credit"" when you purchase their in game currencies in bulk. The whole point of those games is to just turn your pockets inside out.

Think this also means transfer windows will be very quiet with big talents pretty much locked into what ever league they are in as teams don't want to fork out big money to bring them over. The new battleground will now be for young players, pretty much raiding academies and paying big amounts for 14-17 year olds I think.

 It is a shame now other club will get what we've had now the drawbridge is  coming up we will spend the next few years building up our profile expanding and upping our revenue the rest will now be stuck. Yeah they might get one good season and hit 4th but it wont be enough.

The reason he doesnt want sex is because his carnal desire is to kill. Carnal desire isnt sex for anyone. Especially people who are mentally unstable.

Carnal refers to a physical or sexual need. Killing someone can't be a carnal desire because it's an emotional experience, not a physical/sexual one. I can understand it's been a desire of his to kill something he loved, but it isn't his desire to kill in general either. He avoids it if he can but he's open to using it to solve his problems, as such with the DJ. He doesn't seem to get pleasure from killing, only relief.

&gt;I see what your saying, but i still dont agree. And thats ok! I'm not a psychologist, and its just what i remember from a college intro to psych class. I understand what you're explaining to me, I just feel like ID is the evil side of a person. And Rudy 3 was evil.

I don't necessarily think he's evil, but he is definitely deranged. That's up for discussion though. The ""devil on your shoulder"" idea doesn't mean  your ""evil"" side. It mainly pertains to the side of you which contains your vices; the things you don't like about yourself. Rudy3 seems to despise Rudy1, as Rudy1 (to Rudy3) represented all the things he hated about himself. While Rudy3 (to Rudy1) was a part of him he just wanted to ignore, but didn't hate.

&gt;I actually wanted to say thank you for this awesome conversation we are having. Its probably the most civil and grownup discussion about opposing thoughts/onions i've ever had on reddit I just wanted to say thanks.

Thank you as well. I'm starting to see your argument more clearly and it has been quite nice to chat about this. I'm not sure if we'll be able to come to an agreement on this, but it's an interesting topic nonetheless. Rudy, to me, is the most intriguing character in the entire series and one of the most interesting on television in general in my opinion.

One point people have missed here: if nobody else would give you a loan, you could actually use Wonga to rebuild your credit rating. Sure, they are massively expensive (as everyone has pointed out, short-term loans *are*) but if you're in a position where the bank won't give you an overdraft and nobody will loan you money, then the first step to recovery could well be a few Wonga loans.

Take 'em out, pay 'em back. That goes on your credit score, raising it slightly. After a few loans (probably 10 or so), your credit score will be high enough to use other options.

Yes, I know that most people who use Wongo won't do it sensibly, and will probably get deeper in debt. I'm just saying; if you've been silly in the past but are now more sensible, then it'd be a good move (even if you didn't need the money; pay it back on time often enough and your credit score gets to the point where cheaper loans are available).

Oh, bear in mind that somebody checking your credit score lowers your credit score. So don't keep applying for other stuff; keep going for a while before checking.",0,1355856574,null,0,1355920323,0,c7im8xb,t3_1522sd,t1_c7im8xb,t3_1522sd,null,1430709148,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Homophobia is sports is a really serious problem. It's not about being PC. It's not about trying to stamp out banter and jokes. It's about trying to stop people from abusing each other over sexual orientation.

We don't consider the n-word a joke. As a white person, I don't go up to a black friend and say ""what's up nigger?"" I don't post pictures of my black friends wearing hoodies and go ""lol, this guy is such a nigger"". Most people understand that's not a joke. If I get accused of racially abusing someone by saying the n-word, I have a lot of defenses, but ""it was a joke"" isn't a valid one.

The parallel is faggot in terms of severity, but gay can be just as bad. It's insinuating that being gay is a bad thing. In the hyper-masculine world of sports, it says that someone is not masculine and is weak. Whatever you think of the FA, this fine sends a message that it's not ok to make gay jokes. They know this is banter between friends and a joke, but they're closing off avenues for the future. They don't want a situation where a player calls someone on the other team a faggot or gay and then arguing ""it was just a joke, we were bantering"".

For a country that is SO adamant about racism being stopped, to the point where making a racist twitter post can get you arrested, England is extremely behind the times with regards to homophobia. Sorry it had to happen to one of our players, but I completely support the FA's decision here. 

By contrast, last month, a player in the MLS called another player a ""fucking faggot"" in the middle of a very high stakes game, during the play-offs, and was swiftly condemned by the league and the club. He immediately issued a lengthy apology, and still earned a 3-match ban. I supported this punishment as well.

Sure, but if the options are

1. sack half the workforce with lower redundancy pay, the other half keep their job.
1. wind the company up immediately and everyone loses their job with no redundancy pay.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"Compulsory, sure - at least right now. I can easily imagine a hypothetical future in which compulsory abortion could become the moral high ground, though.

I would argue that almost everyone would choose an abortion under the right circumstances:

How many people would choose before conception to have a disabled child? What about if they could make the decision a second after conception? Or 5 minutes after conception? An hour? A day? Etc.

I have a feeling that basically everyone would either choose against it before it happening or would have an abortion if they knew early enough, but for purely human/emotional reasons there is a point at which people will just go ahead with it.

So, first of all barring religious reasons (another kettle of fish, I guess), I would say that if we could tell early enough or had the technology to prevent it from happening in the first place, no one would have disabled children.

But further to this, in a world with few or no disabled people, 500 years in the future, it would become considered cruel and unusual to purposefully have a disabled child. Why would you want to afflict a new person brought into the world with disability? What would they even think of you for allowing them to exist as the 1 disabled person in a world of billions just because.. well, no reason at all. And hell, there would probably be zero disabled facilities at this point, because why would there be?

Anyway, after this is it not unlikely that laws could be brought in to disallow it from happening and create compulsory abortion for any ""extreme"" case where for some reason someone doesn't want to get an abortion (which would probably be beyond comprehension for people in this time anyway). In such a world opinion would be heavily against it.

We only hold the views we currently do because of the current state of the world, it's actually quite subjective and in the future we will probably consider our past selves barbaric for this an hundreds of other reasons, just as we continually do and have done throughout history.

And to make it clear, I don't support compulsory abortions for disabled people but if we have the technology to tell near instantly when someone is pregnant and also what the baby would be like, then I may change my mind.

I know of people with genetic disabilities and illnesses who choose against having children simply because of the likelihood of passing them on. It's hardly as if disabled people are all pro-disabled and want more disabled people in the world. The idea is just that once people are here they are treated equally.

One thing is for certain though: immigration rose exponentially under the labour regime. Whether or not that was the fault of Blair and co, or of Brussels, is again questionable, yet the impact was a lot of cheap manual labour suddenly wandering about the place. I'm not saying that immigration does not bring some benefit when in moderation, but honestly, a desperate individual with a wrench and no home is a much more appealing prospect to an employer of such gentlefolk next to say a local with expectations of working conditions and union laws. 

That is the perception, I feel, that leads both sides to act without first contemplating the effect their actions will have, instead of what is the most visible short-term solution to the problem the public may percieve.

What they really have here is a statistical process control problem. There will be a certain distribution of outcomes that would be expected for a given mix of patient types. By combing the results from all hospitals you can establish where your baseline is. After that you can start to use techniques like [PCA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) to identify which factors affect the outcome the most. Then you can adjust the process to gradually improve outcomes, perhaps by trying to minimise variance across hospitals and surgeons.

In general an employee is not entitled to redundancy payments until they have completed three years of service with their employer.

So all the talk of employers worried about taking on new staff is all a bit silly.

So cutting the &gt;100 redundancies period to 45 days is not going to have a huge impact on cost when considering the new employees, so it will not affect the hiring of new staff.

It does however cut costs when paying off staff who have a service of &gt; 3 years.

So again this will not help in the hiring of new staff, unless you are culling your current employees, to employ new cheaper versions with new job titles.

Granted, we don't have the best homegrown roster in the first-team but have you looked at the U21s and U19s recently? 

Nathaniel Chalobah, Nathan Ake, Josh McEachran, Romelu Lukaku, Thorgan Hazard, Kevin De Bruyne, George Saville, Todd Kane, Matej Delac, Jamal Blackman, Patrick Bamford, Islam Feruz, Lucas Piazon, Ulises Davila - all of them joined the academy over the last few/many years and are progressing fantastically well. Some more than the others, in fact. 

Being in an area like London means that the intake isn't going to be as thick as, say Southampton or Nottingham Forest, but we manage to get a fair bit of talent every year. 

Plus, Roman invested a huge chunk into the Youth academy. How else did you think Cobham happened?

This meant, while it was a good gesture for people above 65, you wouldn't be getting it for ages, so it wasn't too much of a strain on taxes, and therefore the workers who pay them.

Now, life expectancy is 80. This means, on average, people will spend 15 years on their pension. As our society is becoming more elderly, with the baby boomers of post war Britain now getting old, combining with a steady decline in the birthrate, and therefore workers, we've going to have a bigger ratio of dependants (elderly on state pension) to independants (workers who pay tax). This means, if retirement age were to stay at 65, workers would have to pay more taxes to support the elderly.

On a tangential note, an old colleague of mine, Garry, had a disabled son. Garry and his wife were told before his son was born that he would have cystic fibrosis and Down's syndrome and would die young. 

His wife is Catholic so she didn't want an abortion. Although Garry is a Scouser (and not one to normally play to religious meddling) he agreed to his wife's wishes and they had the baby. Now all he does is work his arse off, come home and take care of his son. 

He has to cook special meals every day, his son needs 24 hr care, and will never be able to speak or walk. But never have I seen anybody love anyone as unconditionally as Garry loves his son. He is proud of him, despite his supposed flaws.

true,[deleted],null,null,"1. Some disabilities cannot be diagnosed in utero, like autism for example.  Plus there's such a massive spectrum of functionality within ASD that many people literally can function just as well as anyone else (including academically).

2. What counts as a ""disability""?  My friend has quite mild OCD (actual OCD, not that fake ""omg I'm like sooooo OCD about my nail polish"" type) and is just about to finish her masters degree in maths.  Would she have been aborted?  What about people who have split personality disorder?  Bi polar?  Tourette's? And that's just to name a few.  Would these people be aborted? 

3.  Disabilities come in so many forms that I imagine the financial burden of having to test *every single pregnant woman* for every single disability would be massive. 

4.  Things like Autism and Fragile-X Syndrome affect boys at a much higher rate (I believe fragile-x is 1/4000 boys and 1/8000 girls as a rough figure.). Consequently we would end up with a higher population of females.  I don't know any disabilities that affect girls more than boys, so if there are let me know.

5. A lot of people simply don't like to interfere with nature in such a massive way.  I know this argument doesn't really have much substance to it because, well...we *do* interfere with nature in many ways.  I think a lot of people would have that reaction.

6.  We would have to be living in a world where the church really has a minute level of power.  They're against abortion as it is, and it's one thing to *allow* abortions to happen, it's a **whole** other kettle of fish to actually encourage it...therefore forced abortion is simply unimaginable.

7.  Scientists are always researching cures and medication for these things.  Why should we be spending fortunes aborting children when, some day in the future, we might find a cure, and we can leave it to the families to make personal decisions.  Also, not that this matters on an individual level, but I'm sure various scientific advances have been made because of disabilities, and scientific understanding has increased.  Surely this is valuable to our society? 

8.  On a personal note, I work full-time at a school with kids who have very severe special needs.  I also do part-time work with a family whose child has ASN.  Whilst I would *never wish* for someone to be disabled, there really is something incredible to that whole world.  It's so amazingly diverse, and people within it are so incredibly unique in many ways.  There was a Louis Theroux documentary a while back where he asked a kid with autism ""Would you like to not have autism?"" and the kid replied ""but autism is my life"".  Whilst there are massive issues with anxiety, anger, self-loathing (I know of a pre-teen kid who has tried to commit suicide), most of these are placed on it by the outside world.  We *cannot* be sending this message out to children and adults with ASN.  Can you imagine being disabled and hearing a politician say something like that?  How heartbreaking!  We need to be providing support and care for these people and their families, instead of leaving them to struggle in a world which is really not made for them.  I've seen kids leaving primary school knowing full well that there's about a 99% chance they will be severely bullied at high school.  Many of them can perform just as well as mainstream kids in academics, yet their school experiences are so viciously awful that they choose to drop out as soon as they can.  It's *us* that need fixing, not them. 

Sorry for just numbering an argument but I was brain-farting all over the place.  Also, I'd like to say that I only work in education, so I do not speak as an expert on the actual disabilities, their causes and cures etc.  Mostly I only know about their effects on daily life, behaviour, social abilities, educational factors, so if I'm wrong on any account then please correct me.

If we assume he is, there are various theories. My favourite one (season 6 spoilers)

John Barrowman couldn't be in ""A Good Man Goes To War"" (Season 6). Since this is the kind of episode where you want all your returning companions to be, we could assume they'd want Jack to be there, but already partially evolved: Dorium Maldovar (Blue man). He get's decapitated by the headless monk, but survived, explaining how Jack became a head, and how Dorium survived. 

I know this doesn't explain how he became so deformed (and big), but this could just be dismissed as a side effect of living forever. 

This is just my theory, which I stole from a fellow redditor whose post I can't find back, but there are many more. None is confirmed.
