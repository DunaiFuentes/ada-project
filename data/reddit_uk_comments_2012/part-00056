An immediate ghost-written statement by the PR department read out by, or attributed to Suarez saying ""I understand that Mr Evra was offended by the statement and I fully apologise for any offence taken"" would have done wonders for the whole situation without admitting guilt or wrongdoing.

From that standpoint they would have gone into the ""trial"" with a leg to stand on. Due to the nonsense that went on, Suarez went into the trial a guilty man, with the extremely biased FA determined to get him banned for as long as possible.

**Fun fact**: the two experts on Uruguayan Spanish the FA brought in to determine Suarez' intent were two Englishmen from the University of Manchester, who had never lived in Uruguay. 

Even so, they said it was hugely unlikely that Suarez would have said 'Blackie, Blackie' or whatever Evra claimed, because in Spanish, you simply don't insult people by just using the word ""black"". Its not an insult on its own. They said he might have said ""black shit"" or similar, but he wouldn't have just said ""Black"" for an insult, as Evra claimed.

It is clearly innovating to reduce tax exposure however it is not playing fair in terms of UK tax.

Globally the world economy is not better off due to this legal innovation. 

Furthermore the company is freeloading as it is relying on UK regulation, legal system and commercial environment to make its profit yet it is not subsidising this environment like everyone else by paying its share of taxes. Its parasitical extraction from the economy.

This race to the bottom for corporate taxation (while completely understandable from a game theory point of view - c.f. prisoner's dilemma) has an end result of close to zero tax on corporations and much higher individual tax burden via income tax.

I'm using his quote to illustrate the point that changing your mind when the facts/reasoning change *is* a good thing -- cf ""Hell there's a benefit in not being elected in that you can choose your opinion if you so change it, is that a good thing? In some respects yes and no, depends on your preference.""

&gt; as for my previous point it's likely as not to have party supporters holding true sway keeping loyal through thick and thin.

In a true Senate the appointments would not be by the parties, hence no (overt) party supporters. And even party supporters, freed from the shackles of the whip, will rebel when they believe they are right.

&gt; And my religious point is because of suggesting the Lords Spiritual which still exist today and yes in my opinion are antiquated, 

Being antiquated is not the point, though. The 'modern' scientific method is pretty antiquated but is no less relevant.

&gt; but who is to say by appointment some religious persons may not be appointed too.

Because the Senators would be drawn from institutions which have a strong basis in critical thinking.

&gt; Let's face it in a world focused on the power of religious extremism an expert in religion could and has be seen as a boon to some for insight if you'd consider it that.

I agree. And for this reason I do not yet reject the idea of a faith component to the Senate. However, although religious extremism comes from many quarters, all of it can be shot down (metaphorically speaking) by good reasoning. And I would suggest, therefore, does not require particular insight but merely an understanding of human nature.

&gt; You are not going to have a set of almost meritocratically elected atheists in the upper house in a majority, this is the ideal most Lords supporters I meet want and really it's unrealistic. 

They don't have to be atheists per se. Many who believe in some kind of god still manage to apply logical reasoning when it matters -- John Polkinghorne for example.

Further, 'meritocratically elected' is a largely contradictory conjunction.

&gt; Any selection will be scrutinised, questioning it's relationship of having a truly representative nature.

Demographically representative is not what's required. We have a house of representatives -- the Commons. What we need is an *effective* revising chamber; one that does the job well. What they must represent is good reasoning.

Your never going to be able to make things equal across a country as disparate as the UK. People who live in more rural areas are always going to have less infrastructure than those who live in more densely populated areas and even with far higher taxes and redistribution your not going to be able to fix that, let alone with the taxes we pay now. So yes, things will be unequal even though people pay the same level of tax (although they don't as things like council tax do vary). It's not fair but then a lot of things aren't.

&gt; I just think comprehensives with sets work best, and there needs to be more acceptance that the vast number of problems are symptoms of wider ills in society which schools cannot hope to reverse. Sadly there doesn't seem to be much impetus to fix them outside of school either.

Even sets have the same problems, if you don't have enough students you can't really split classes up as you won't be able to afford the extra staff or the space to run a separate class. So some kids might have to travel further to school but this isn't the end of the world. And yes, schools can only do so much with socio-economic issues, but the way schools work now just works to ensure those problems are transfered from generation to generation.

So while you don't think it's fair that you can't run separate schools for those falling behind across the entire country in a big national scheme, I don't think it's fair that we don't try new ideas in areas where the logistics are workable because they aren't in other areas.

An example is when he's asked if Rory and Amy ever had sex in the tardis while in flight, and it honestly hadn't occurred to him that on their wedding night, they might get off their gear and get down.  And even when confronted about it, he says something like:

&gt; How should I know?  It's all very human...  It's not like they put up a balloon or anything...

*“I consider that a man’s brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things, so that he has difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skillful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.”*

River is just such a blatant [Mary Sue](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue) (warning: TV Tropes link), that she works best in small doses, as an occasional bump-into kind of character.  I actually like the character, but building a whole arc around her was a bit much.  I did enjoy the tables being turned a bit as we moved forward in the Doctor's timeline and backward on River's and he started to know more than she did, though the ""power shift"" was somewhat counteracted by the fact that he was terrified and trying to avoid his own death.  I enjoy seeing some cracks in the Doctor's armor; it humanizes him. But there were points at the end of the last series where he seemed to be mostly cracks and not much armor.  We had a broken Doctor at the start of Eccleston's run, and it worked well, but I don't think we need to do that again.

You reference arguing about it the issue: Are you of the impression that many people put time and effort into countering religious influence or activity because they wish to prove their opposition wrong? Personally my own motivation, in campaigning secular issues, is to ensure that no-one is forced into following a religious activity or path due to the wishes of a minority faith (or majority for that matter).

For example, the reason behind the BHA Census Campaign - ""If you're not religious then please don't put ""Christian"" etc. on the census!"" - was to ensure that the influence of Christianity, in the planning of legislation or the allocation of public services, is limited due to how few people are actively Christian. Similarly the number of faith run schools in the UK does not reflect the number of actually religious people (but should that matter considering that many non-religious families have no option but to send their kids to faith schools).

Further, arguing about an issue like this has the benefit of 'freeing' a mind from the thrall of religious indoctrination, should they wish to.

1. They're designed by asking people how they voted in the actual elections and then they weight it deliberately based on the actual results.  You can't do this in a questionnaire about god because there is no baseline so it has some inherent bias.

true,hauntedchippy,null,null,"&gt;We as humans are natural beings. Are our decisions natural? No.

You've just freight-trained through a very difficult issue on the nature of free will rather callously here.  If you believe human beings have souls which separate them from the nature than you can legitimately define human activities to be unnatural or artificial, but you have an interesting task ahead of you to define where the line between natural/artificial is.  Is it natural to use a stick to reach food or a stone to crack nuts?  What about using the stone to sharpen the stick?  Or using the stone to cut trees?  Using the cut trees to build shelters?  Where does it begin?

Alternatively, the word 'artificial' is simply used to define anything humans do that isn't done by anything else in nature, without defining it in contrast to natural processes (you can think of 'artificial' being a subset of 'natural').

&gt;and natural selection, again by definition, is survival-guided, NOT thought-guided. 

And again you are defining the terms to specifically preclude the action of a supernatural being. 'Natural selection' is a human definition and one that certainly does not logically preclude that a supernatural being has not been fiddling the mutations or guiding the process by actions such as natural disasters.

&gt;Anyway,

If you want to dig up old shows (in a vague order of most to least accessible) look for anything with **Alan Partridge** in the title, also **The Day Today**, Father Ted (you could argue that it's Irish, but it was more popular in the UK than in Ireland), The League of Gentlemen, any Charlie Brooker shows, anything by Derren Brown (this one isn't comedy, it's technically magic but it doesn't look like magic), check out Garth Marenghi's Darkplace, Look Around You, Big Train, Nathan Barley, **Brass Eye**, Jam, Attention Scum!, and probably loads more that I'm forgetting.

Oh, also, I wouldn't advise it if you have a very black and white view of the world because it would probably annoy you, but if you find the world to be a big complex swirling shapeless mess of interdependent and ultimately flawed ideas, you should check out the documentary **All Watched Over By Machines Of Loving Grace**.

You might be able to apply for a student/holiday visa and 'disappear' once you arrive here. I had a friend from America visit for two weeks at Christmas and she didn't have a visa, only a return ticket. Immigration just asked if she was a student and then let her in, she could have just went off the radar and they wouldn't know any better. However I think the home office has been made aware of this semi-loop hole in recent months.

**But** the problem is what happens once you get here; you need proof of citizenship to rent accommodation, get a job, get medical treatment etc etc. Sure many illegal immigrants do get by with living in appalling housing rented by dodgy landlords, and doing shit/dangerous jobs for a shit wage under the threat of being reported to immigration - but would you know where to find these people? And convince them to help you over their own families and people? If you want to live in the UK then you want a better quality of life than that.

If you did get caught, you'd be held in custody for a day or so in a detention centre whilst they worked out where exactly you're from and why you shouldn't be here, and then you'd be on the next flight home. Your name would most likely get on a register warning airports that you're an immigration risk should you try to get back into the country, you might not ever be let back in again.

I just gave you examples as to why personal stuff like who/what created the Universe overall has a bearing on the legislation of this country. One does not generally think that Yahweh created the Universe without being a Christian (or Jew, I suppose). But with regard to this case, who's arguing exaclty?

I'm a big fan of the BrewDog pub near Broadway. Great craft beers, friendly atmosphere and an N64 in the corner. Perfect. 

Broadway has a good cinema of course. The bar there has lots of local beers and good coffee. 

Delilah is the place to go if you're feeling rich and want a delicious fancypants breakfast. 

The Sir John Borlase Warren do good burgers. 

Tilt serve up amazing and reasonably-priced cocktails. 

Last time I went to the Organ Grinder pub they were running a beer festival with loads of unusual and limited edition ales, and a mobile pizza oven out back! Amazing. 

Sherwood Cafe or Hollies are good for a less fancypants, greasy-spoon breakfast. Great places to sit and contemplate the universe over a bacon roll. 

Lee Rosy for a nice cup of tea and a sit down. Oddly not listed on Google Maps, but it's next door to Edin's and opposite Broadway.

That said, it would be very strange if the Doctor was anything other than a man. Not only because it goes against history but because the dynamic as a male Doctor works. It's possible, in factdefinite, that gender and skin colour were overlooked in the past - and they are both divisive issues in terms of ratings too. However, making up for this overlooking by appoointing a female Doctor seems to obvious. There doesn't need to be one.

If there was a male companion rather than female - which could imply a gay doctor, again an idea which is entriely plausible - it would stink of an attempt at being 'cutting' and 'edgy'.

true,tgjer,davison,Davison,"Nothing is ever set in stone in this show. But I disagree that a female Doctor would be ""just a ratings gimmick."" 

Casting attractive young actors as the Doctor is mostly a ratings gimmick, but the writers have made it part of the Doctor's character development and interactions with other characters. Plot-wise, the Doctor now looks young because he is *old.* Because when he was young and insecure he tried to appear old and wise; now he's ancient and alone, and he prefers the company of the young.

And the nature of the Doctor's character is that he's theoretically infinitely variable. With each regeneration the Doctor is the same being reinvented. Like reincarnation without the inconvenience of having to be a baby again, the core persists but all the details change. That's how the show survives, at nearly 50 years old if it *didn't* constantly reinvent the main character it would have gone stale and died decades ago.

So why not see what the Doctor would be like as a woman? It wouldn't be any more dramatic than the change from being seen by others as an elderly space hobo to being seen as the kind of guy who has to fend amorous companions off with a stick.

And it could bring interesting new dynamics and interactions and plot possibilities. The First doctor couldn't be the one to marry Marilyn Monroe or Queen Bess or River. A female Doctor (or a Doctor who doesn't look white) would probably have gotten a very different response from the Nixon administration.

&gt;The line between natural and artificial is whether something is the product of a conscious choice - whether it is by design. 

The issue is in the precise definition of those words (what is conscious?  Is an ape conscious?  Is a raven? etc).  As it is you are simply stating ""something is artificial if it's artificial"".  You are using a dictionary definition of artificial to justify itself (this is the fallacy of begging the question).

&gt;This isn't controversial or particularly complicated.

It is because it implicitly tackles the issue of free will and the nature of what makes humans different from other forms of life.

&gt;I feel like you don't understand evolution very well.

Full disclosure, I am a biologist but I am playing devils advocate here.

&gt;I am saying that...

I can only repeat ""and again you are defining the terms to preclude other possibilities"" so often.  You are getting hung up on the man made definitions of some words.  When science described evolution as being driven by natural selection that was *not* a logical argument that automatically made the intervention of supernatural entities impossible.  Aliens could right now be orbiting the Earth in an invisible spacecraft, carefully crafting there own genes and slipping them into the population gradually to make it *look* natural.  Such a possibility is not precluded by what we understand about biology.

The Winchesters would roll into town in their improbably cool car and start digging around.  They would probably look into the history of the place and watch for anything weird, like people claiming to have had a supernatural experience at the house.  It's possible they might have found some or all of the same clues Sally Sparrow did.

At that point, the question becomes ""How do we kill it?""  If they've connected the Easter Egg to the Angels, they would look for ways to use the Quantum Lock to their advantage - they can paralyze the enemy instantly, they just need to make that an advantage.  Can an Angel break chains?  What about dumping it in a shallow grave filled with concrete?  Locking it in a furnace?

That's all assuming that they don't bring in a supernatural weapon of their own.  They have had weapons that could kill anything short of Satan himself, they have fought the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and won, and they have literal angels who owe them favors.

In maybe-not-the-right order:

* **The Doctor's Wife**. A story that explores something we've all felt was true for the last 50 years worth of Doctor Who.
* **The Deadly Assassin**. Tom Baker vs. the Master, and the Master is, well, winning for most of the story. Infamous for the drowning Doctor scene, and for inventing the Matrix before Keanu Reeves.
* **City of Death**. Lalla Ward, Tom Baker, Julian Glover, written by (among others) Douglas Adams, and set in Paris. Everything turns out brilliant.
* **Vincent and the Doctor**. Needs no explanation.
* **Ghost Light**. I love all of Season 26, but this one is just so bizarre. With the ultimate manipulative Doctor, it's a wibbly wobbly story that half forgets to explain itself (much like the Doctor himself), and it just leaves you as confused as Ace. Also, it's set in a Victorian house with monsters and a Neandertal butler.

People have been ignoring rules on not holding more than one passport for a long time. I am surprised by respectable friends happily travelling to the other country with the second ""forbidden"" passport tucked in their luggage -- they obviously don't fear terrible consequences if it was discovered. The usual advice is just to make sure that you enter and leave a country using the same passport.

Moffat hasn't done women well for a *very* long time and has managed to sexualize every major female character since. He even has the Doctor start calling the TARDIS ""sexy"", for Pete's sake! 

In Let's Kill Hitler he has the Doctor give an aside ""of course she's difficult, she's a woman!"". Do you think someone like that is going to be able to tactfully handle a gender transition?

And beyond that let's look at the BBC financially. Doctor Who's been having a spot of difficulty and with their new simulcasting they're trying to have it catch on big time in America. 

Do you honestly think that the BBC would take the hundred of new viewers who are just coming into the show and risk alienating them with a sudden unwarranted gender-swap? That would be ratings suicide! They would never take such a risk.

The idea of gender swapping has been the thing of farce and folly since Twelfth Night. It's the subject of raunchy Z-Grade sex comedies. It's a cheap way to get laughs.

Essentially making the Doctor, a character who has never been about gender and whose ""masculinity"" or even gender itself is a thing designed to be ignored and never meant to have been made the forefront and has been the same gender for *generations*, into a woman suddenly is the ultimate way of saying ""we're out of ideas, let's just slap some tits on him"".

true,Intrinsically1,lfc50,,"My prediction. 

Kuyt &amp; Maxi - as you say are almost certainly leaving.  Maxi more so than Kuyt, but Kuyt just doesn't have the legs that he used to and they are both hitting our wage bill pretty hard. 

Adam - The first player I think we should dump.  He has been pretty average this season and it hasn't looked like he has clicked with the team.  If we can get back close to the £7M we payed for him it would be well worth it.  

Carragher - by all rights he should go.  We can't afford £90,000/week for a player who is as old and out of form as he now is.  That being said I think he will most likely stay and wouldn't be surprised if he had some sort of player-coach role as he has made his intentions of pursuing that career clear and he has enough stock with the club to be able to pull something like that and with considerationg that Hyypia extended his contract with Bayer Leverkusen and he wont be coming back this season.

Suarez - stay for at least this next season.  Obvious that we should do everything we can to keep him, but I just don't know if he will stay in the long run if we don't give him CL football (would like to think otherwise but hard to say).  For a player who cost £22M we could probably get at least £30M out of him, maybe more if he has a better season next year.

Carroll - stays for sure IMO.  He isn't the sort of player who would leave because we aren't making CL, and now that he is back to strength/fitness I think we will really benefit from having him around.  Was listening to that interview with Damien Comolli that was posted here the other day, sounded like Carroll has made enormous progress with his fitness since arriving and that it took him a long time to get over his thigh injury he had when he first joined us. 

Johnson - We could get at least  £10 out of him, but I don't think we can afford to get rid of him, nor should anyone think we should IMO.  He has been good this season, if we're getting rid of a left back it would more likely be Aurelio. 

Downing - who knows.  He has been shocking but we can't expect to get anywhere near his £20M transfer fee back.  Hard call to make if they will cut their losses or if they see something in him that most of us don't.

Henderson - stays and is HOPEFULLY allowed to play central mid where he belongs.  He's still very young and shows a lot of potential, just not on the wings.  The kid works hard and from interviews it sounds like he works even harder in training, one to hold onto IMO.

Gerrard - Stays, clearly.  Will be interesting to see his role next year, he is definitely getting old and the way he has been intermittently started makes me feel like he is going the course of Bellamy where his fitness just doesn't allow him to start game in game out anymore.  Another thing which hasn't been addressed is the fact that his experience and seniority compared to our younger players really throws a spanner in the works for our midfield.  Every other midfielder seems to be following their specific instructions but Gerrard often will encroaches on their positions and drops back into CDM when players aren't performing.  I mean, he does this because he is the captain and he is the best player in our squad (and he should be doing this), but his is a double edged sword because although it often saves us or shuts down attacks, it damages the confidence of our younger guys and doesn't allow them to fully develop into their positions.  Hopefully with Lucas to his rear and Suarez ahead of him next season there is more confidence in the midfield.  /rant  Don't get me wrong I love Gerrard, I can just hope our midfield sorts itself out.

Lucas - Stays.  HOPEFULLY he can get back to full strength relatively quickly.  I really would hate to see him take a season to get back to his old self.  

Spearing - hasn't been great but we seem to be forgetting he is just a [baby](http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae325/Mike90215/JayTunnel11.gif).  Just kidding, he's 23.  I really don't know.  He's a local, he really loves the club and you can see he desperately wants a place in it.  More likely a loan to get some experience or they keep him in my mind. 

Shelvey - stays.  He's been pretty fantastic for a 20 year old.  A lot of raw talent and seems intelligent the way he plays.  I see us keeping him as a stand in for Lucas.  He is similar to the early Lucas in some respects.  Hopefully we can hone that talent and get a lot out of him.

Coates - Stays.  Needs to be developed but hopefully he gets a decent amount of play time, he seems like he has a ton of potential.

Reina Skrtel Agger - All stay.  We need them, they have been the foundation of our team this year.  Reina hasn't been as good as he has in previous years but he is still champions league class.

Flanagan and Kelly - stay as back up defenders and develop.

Sterling - surely he will get loaned out to develop?  I really want to see him in Red but he needs to develop and we won't be able to give him enough starting opportunities.  I would love to see him start of Sunday against Swansea.  Part of me sees this as an important game to at least get 7th in the league, but on the other hand any decisions about Kenny's future [have probably already been made](http://images.icnetwork.co.uk/upl/liverpoolecho/may2012/6/3/460x345/image-16-for-liverpool-fc-vs-chelsea-fa-cup-final-gallery-293019031.jpg) so maybe there's a small chance he will actually get a start.

We have to be realistic, we aren't going to have a lot of money to play around with. Even after selling a few players having £40 or £50M is probably being *extremely* optimistic. Cavani, Giroud, Dzeko - we might be able to sign Dzeko with our whole budget *if we're lucky*. 

We're going to have to be extremely careful with our money. The owners have made a statement by firing Comolli. They are not going to be in favour of buying expensive proven talent nor are they going to give us the money to. I think looking at Newcastle's purchases of this season is a good place to start to see what kind of purchasing we will be doing.

A more realistic wishlist:

[Belhanda](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppXRe7gclig) - Only real reason is because Kenny was at a Montpellier game recently + we need a winger + we can't afford Giroud = Belhanda is being considered. £7-9M

[Dempsey](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArBu5Vwi9Ek) - he's had a phenomenal season at Fulham and we need another striker/winger with Kuyt (probably) gone. His price won't be astronomical, maybe £14M at most. Plus Werner's comments the other day. 

[Hoilett](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddAvft67RtA) - Winger - Blackburn with 7 goals and 7 assists this year. Too good to stay with QPR when they are relegated (bar divine intervention on Sunday). We could have him for £7M - £8M

[Luuk De Jong](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0qXuXivFNA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;hd=1) - Striker - FC Twente. £7-8M and we could probably have him. He's scored 30 goals in the dutch league this year and looks good.

Yakubu - With Blackburn relegated he is too good/expensive to stay in that squad. He's been good this year

The nature of war also makes it very strange. We're led to believe that ordinary ""linear"" people like us would not even understand it. It probably involves warfare on a truely galactic scale (seeing as both parties could probably build gigantic celestial engines from stealing planets, or even 'pilot' planets), and spans billions of years and an unlimited number of parallel universes.. it's best left to the imagination.

That said, I'm sure there's some room for Time War stories to be told. By all accounts, the Eighth Doctor deserves more screen time. And Gallifrey is theoretically home to Romana, Leela, both their K9s, and whatever regenegade Time Lord you can think of. Maybe even Ace and Susan.

My speculative setting for a Gallifrey story:

* Romana as a President in exile, living in the outside wastelands of Gallifrey.
* Leela + K9, and Andred + his guards as her 'court'. The Outsiders and loyal Time Lords have flocked to her.
* Rassilon leads from the Citadel, having united all remaining Gallifreyan Houses under one color.
* Renegades like the Doctor and the Master are not necessarily choosing a side in this.. I don't think the Doctor would accept any authority figure, even if it was Romana. He'd just wander around, and occasionally be forced to do Rassilon or Romana's bidding via long-distance TARDIS manipulation (that's the way it always happened on TV, anyway).

Abandoned/ruined church in the middle of the Somerset levels, raided supplies from town I live in and those along the way, small village at the foot of the (bloody steep) hill the church's on, lots of drainage ditches and a small river nearby. Set up the church as a temporary base whilst logging the surrounding trees (got a chainsaw) to reinforce and rebuild.   
Cows, sheep and willow in the surrounding fields gives food, clothes and fuel to burn (for fire at least, raiding and storing petrol's a different matter, sadly it won't last very long at all). There's probably rabbits too, but the levels are prone to flooding so not many. River gives water, clean after a boil. Ammunition's limited, but right now have access to about 5 air rifles, and several thousand pellets- at least one's pump powered, so infinite usage potentially.  
Two DIY stores in town to get hatchets/tools etc- hatchets highlighted because they're a useful short-range weapon too. Big tesco, two Co-Ops, but I suspect they'll all be raided bloody quickly. Food supplies from all the houses of the people coming with me, all tinned and presevereds we can get.   
After everything can be assumed safe, there's at least 5 rooves worth of solar panels very close to my house which I would expend a lot of effort for, not only for my inner technophile and luddiphobic but also because it means radios/equipment can be kept powered indefinitely.

Another important milestone in River's life had also occurred, though it was part of a DVD special of mini episodes, ""Night and the Doctor"". 

Spoiler for that episode below:

In the 4th episode, ""Last Night"" the Doctor winds up picking up a future version of River in the Tardis, while the present River is getting ready for their date. A future version of the Doctor comes to get Future River and take her back to his Tardis. Future River explains to present Doctor that they are going to see the Singing Towers of Darillium. After she leaves the Tardis, the two Doctors discuss how before the Library, River said that the last time she saw him at the Singing Towers of Darillium, meaning Future Doctor was going on his last date with River before she ""dies"".  

Hopefully we will get to see the events of that date and see when the Doctor gives River her sonic screwdriver and tells her to go to the library.

All religions offer a route to contentedness, spiritual redemption and a path toward enlightenment.

This axiom is still inherent in abrahamic religion too ""God is truth"". ""God is love"". ""Jesus is the living spirit of God on earth and to live like him, you can see truth and achieve godliness.""

It's all the same jive, it's just the lyrics are changed.

Any social protocol dictated by scripture is a suggestion to achieve contentedness and enlightenment.

The fact the texts are so wide open to interpretation and - particularly regarding western scripture - deformed by ambiguous morality that doesn't stand up to scrutiny even by it's own standards is merely the proof of the fallability of man.

I live in a flat with a maybe a 22k value less than a 10 minute drive will see you in front of a home going for 1 250 000. 

The local bus that serves this area is called the scum bus, as is the bus that the people of this area use to get to the local college to try to improve their lives. 

When I tell people were I live they are surprised and offer sympathy. There are a lot worse places to live in the UK to live than here. 

But the PM can get away with misquoting statistics about the poor in the house of commons and no one calls him out on this. Benefit fraud is always in the news and people go to prison for it but late payments of tax (from the rich) cost us 25 times as much every year and how often do you hear about that?

In the house of commons it would be  unacceptable to refer to a person of Pakistani descent as a shop keeper but when John Prescott ever got up to speak he was met with a barrage of drink orders (his first job was a ship’s steward, a working class occupation). Jeremy Kyle has made a career out of exploiting the poor, I have never heard of a middle class idiot being a guest on his show that was identified by Manchester district judge Alan Berg as human bear baiting.

People round where I live see the abuse every day as they get it directed at them, the local paper will not even deliver to my area, not as it is unsafe it is just not economically viable. So the people that need the jobs the most don’t get to read about the local jobs. Other more affluent people come into my area to park and get stoned as we do not matter and if they are asked to turn the car stereo down you will get told “to get back into your house that I pay for you scum”. The police do not respond to noise complaints around here but do when I am at a friends, a 5 minute walk away.

Areas of deprivation not only have their own problems but are considered safe areas for more organised criminals. You cannot leave a bike outside a local shop as even a secured bike may well be gone when you get out. And we face a lot worse.

I leave off my area in my letters, as when I do I don't get replies. 

In 2010 only 44 out of 3000 undergraduates starting Oxbridge came from backgrounds that meant they qualified for free school meals. Smart people happen everywhere. 

Reviews on health inequalities from Black to Marmot all say that poverty cost people their lives, but we live in an environment that blames people who live in poverty for the poverty they live in whilst we have one of the lowest levels of social mobility in the developed world. 

The minister of health has recently stated that if you work for the NHS in a poor area you will be paid less, whilst doing more work with fewer resources. Where do you think the best staff will go?

The simple fact is it is okay to have a go at the poor, Vicky Pollard – would it be accepted if this were a caricature of a black person? 

But I’m sure that your belief system that the poor are not discriminated against is better than the very obvious facts. I have to say the direct abuse does not come from the rich, as people round here don’t mix with the rich, but from people just slightly higher in status. People that have the ability to move to a slightly nicer area and have the luxury of a meal every day and don’t end up paying out most of their income just to pay inflated gas and electricity bills. 

So the infighting of the poor and nearly poor must be a great game to watch from above. 

The real danger is in the fact that the uninformed have a voice.

But when we're playing away and our home kit has the same color as the home team, we'll play in our aways. If they are still similar, we'll play in our third kits. Let me further explain: 

Here's an example: When we play Swansea tomorrow, (away), their home colors are black and white. Which means we'll probably wear our home kits. (Away kit would would be similar by the black, Third kits would be similar by the white base color).  

Also, from what you said: **""Hence why Chelsea still wears blue at Anfield, but Manure wears white/black/blue/anything but red.""** Chelsea wear their home kits (blue) at Anfield because it doesn't conflict with our *mostly* solid red kit. But when Man United visits, they wear their away kits (purple/blue) because once again, it isn't similar to our solid red home kit.

RTD wrote the character with the intent of it being the Doctor's mother, but has since said that it's ""whoever you want her to be"". 

He said fans will likely think that it's Time Lady, companion to the Doctor, and (in expanded universe material) became Lord President of Gallifrey Romana, who likely was usurped by Rassilon (hence the ""weeping"" punishment for her).

Additionally it could be Susan, the Doctor's granddaughter. This theory has been given particular credence by how when asked ""who was she?"" by Wilf he looks to Donna (Wilf's granddaughter).

And on the note of looking at Donna when asked who it was, maybe it's Donna. Dunno how, but I guess that's an option.

Also, she wears all white, which could be an indication that she's an incarnation of the White Guardian (an important character during the Fourth Doctor's term who helped maintain the balance of reality against the Black Guardian).

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"but if it's trivialities and tritisms like the golden rule you're after then Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Zoroastrianism and untold others have it as a fundamental cornerstone.  Or you could use the secular upgraded 'do unto others, wherever reasonable, as they want to be done by' because as GBS says 'their tastes may be different...' 
  
really though it's a huge oversimplification, the moral theorists of the secular world have torn it to pieces time and time again - how does it deal with the train track dilemma? or any of the related confusions of morality which have been detected since it was scribed?  
  
I agree that the Christian system was an amazing advance on the Jewish (no hate intended) and that people like Assisi,  Dunn and Calvin have done masses to advance and forward the thinking - however, why stop in the middle ages? why try to live in what's fast becoming a post-industrial world with the ethics system of a pre-industrial system?  certainly when that system has been shown so often in history to allow terrible deeds - need i even mention the devout tomas de torquemada?  
  
The last hundred years has proven beyond any reasonable doubt that natural system control the world, from chaos theory to the human genome everything leans towards the idea that we're simply patten matching computers with an over riding urge to survive and procreate; to understand us as beings we simply must come at the question from a naturalist perspective, from a scientific and measured perspective.  No more should we punish people for being aberrant to some poorly imagined dietys whims, no more should we apply value to people based on outdated concepts of spiritual perfection.  We must accept our reality and try to transcend it, this is the only way we're going to make society a sensible and nice place to live.   
  
Of course we can't throw away eight thousand years or however long the shamanistic tradition has lasted, however nor can we keep them forever as if god sent and holy.  If there is a god then he doesn't interfear and he didn't write the bible, surely you can see that no wise being could possibly have created me simply to suffer? created with urges to perform acts which are abomination? created without guidance but punished if i stray from a path i can't see and can't understand?  a path which feels so wrong to me i could never accept it? 
  
then this concept of Hell, ok not entirely biblical but do you know why they adopted it and it became so popular?  because the actual bible verses which explain what happen are fucking horrific, surely you've read the last book? the deranged delusions of Paul? god will pour plagues and punishments upon us until we get to knee and bow to him for all eternity while some monotonous cube repeats benedictions! what kind of moral system threatens either of those things? a Dante devil pit or endtimes torture then oblivion if you're unlucky and cloud real estate in north korea times a thousand for a numbingly dull eternity if you're lucky.  Basing choices on these things is not convivial to making good choices, to living at piece with the world or accepting others failings graciously.

As a gun owner, I'm going to say this: I don't think gun control has *any* correlation with violent crime rates. Why?

Peri had a terrible fake American accent and came across as whiny, while Mel was obnoxiously perky and just not well characterized in general.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"I'm rather fond of the pantheism perspective which essentially defines ""God"" to be nothing more or less than the totally of creation.  Everything in the Universe (and outside of it if you subscribe to the Multiverse theory) is part of ""God"", including you, me, the table, every living thing, every planet, every star, every atom, quark, neutrino, and so on.  Even the  crumbs down the back of the sofa.  They're part of ""God"", too.  

It's easy to show that ""God"" exists (proof: I think therefore I am, and I am part of ""God""), is an intelligent being (by the same proof: I am intelligent enough to reason about ""God"", and I am part of ""God"") and lives in Guildford (ditto).  But not exclusively.  ""God"" also *doesn't* exist as a material being (because ""God"" incorporates energy and other non-matter things), *isn't* intelligent (my fingernail clippings, for example, are a non-intelligent part of ""God"") and also lives on a planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not in Guildford as previously claimed. 

Although it's little more than a semantic trick to define ""God"" in a way that makes sense (isn't all religious dogma?), the nice thing about it is that it's completely rational, logical and consistent with scientific principles.   There's no longer anything *super*natural about ""God"" and no hocus-pocus required.  In fact, whenever I hear someone talk about ""God"" I just silently substitute the word ""Universe"" in my head and it usually makes perfect sense.

The problem with religion is not that people come up with interesting definitions of God that satisfy their own philosophical ponderings about the nature of existence, but that they fool themselves into thinking that they *know* these things to be true and start trying to run their own and other people's lives by them.

When London won the bid seven years ago, I wasn't the only one who saw it as a huge boost to the engineering sector. When the economic crash happened, a lot of major engineering projects were cancelled, and a lot of engineers lost their jobs. Having the olympics kept a lot of people working during that time.

The £6-7 billion of public money being spent on the olympics is mostly going towards infrastructure improvements, and laying the groundwork for the legacy plan for the area around the olympic site. 

While I completely disagree with how the olympics are being used as a showcase for corporate sponsors and the military/security industry, and as a land grab over one of the few remaining undeveloped areas of London, I also believe that the olympics has provided british engineering talent with an opportunity to create awesome power stations, tools, technologies, and infrastructure, which are likely to be completed on time and under budget. But as with most major civil engineering projects, the full impacts aren't going to be seen for another generation, and at the moment, all the focus on the games is about the spectacle and security operation that will be going on for three weeks in July and August.

Just to add a bit of perspective:

You can no longer walk out of university and expect to get a good job, you've got to earn it.

And if anyone starts complaining about the cost of studying abroad or doing a placement, it's an investment! The cost of studying abroad is half of your home tuition fees when going to a partnered university, and I found that living costs were cheaper in Toronto (where I went) than here in the UK. I probably spent more than I should have simple because I wanted to travel, but that was my own choice. Then for placements, a lot of them pay. It may be a small amount, but it's pay.

No, I think it's quite the reverse, guns used to be legal in the UK, however due to some major incidents they were outlawed. I personally don't see why they would be legal in any first world society.

To put it in to context, per 100,000 people in the US, 10 people die from shootings. 

Per 200,000 people in the UK, only 1 person dies to a shooting. 

That's 10x less death for an extra 100,000 people.

&gt;2.Do you think the fact that people are not permitted to carry weapons in self defense contributes to petty crime/violence on the streets?

I see what you mean, however I'd argue the reverse, ordinary people aren't likely to possess a gun at all times - criminals however are, I'd say having guns legal means not only a higher chance of crime, but a significantly higher chance of Man Slaughter/Murder.

&gt;We understand teapots. They are constructed by us. The chances of one orbiting mars are ludicrously small because that would imply that something has placed it there (for no conceivable reason).

Which doesn't invalidate the point which is there is no *disproof* of such a thing and so it is logical to remain agnostic to it's existence.  Saying there is no teapot is a position of blind faith.

Completely unsuccessful - not sure why, but I have a feeling my degree wasn't 'worth' anything to most employers, because of where it was from.

Most of my classmates are still unemployed, waiting for that £25k graduate starting position with company car, laptop and blackberry. For most, I don't think it's going to happen.

Most are still posting on FB about how difficult they're finding it, and how they've blown off suggestions from the Job Centre to work in supermarkets and the like.

true,ColonelMolerat,null,null,"1. Don't think so. There is a bit of a movement to allow the killing of home intruders. Personally, the law seems clear enough - reasonable force is allowed to defend yourself. There was a case of somebody getting jail (I think) stabbing a burglar something like 26 times and another case of jail for somebody calling their friends, chasing a burglar down the street and beating them with a cricket bat until they were permanently damaged. The tabloid papers kicked up a stink that these people should have been allowed to 'defend' themselves.

2. Errrrrmmmmmm. Maybe petty violence. I dress slightly unusually and have been attacked/intimidated a few times. Perhaps if guns were more common people would think twice before starting something. I'd rather not have the guns about, though - and I'd be a little worried of a crazy person with a gun taking a dislike to me, getting into an argument and shooting me.

3. Not really. Maybe some of the more 'casual' rioters and those first to attack would have dispersed. But they'd be back with guns - and even if the riots were a fraction of the size, but there were bulletholes and blood in the street, I'd consider that worse.

4. There already is some discretion for knives. Guns, I doubt it, unless the officer is a bit dodgy. Even for knives, I think the police play it safe. As a teenager, I had a chain I'd hang interesting things I owned or found from. I had a multipurpose pen knife (legally permissible, swiss-army style) hanging from it and a bobby (community support officer perhaps?) told me to take it off and keep it in my pocket 'in case it was used against me', as well as taking my name and address.

I'm a small shop owner and I don't want guns. If a thug causes trouble I can fight back/call the police/hand over the goods and claim insurance. I feel much, much safer knowing that *very* few people have guns than if everybody had them. If someone came into my shop with a gun (and I had one myself) I imagine I'd just get scared or angry and do something rash, getting myself shot. Also, unless I was prepared to shoot them as soon as they looked at me funny, they'd have me at gunpoint before I could reach for mine - then, even if they got distracted putting accordions into their bag marked 'swag', I'd probably be too scared of fucking up to risk trying anything.

true,istara,australia,Australia,"Yes, it's very much about societal norms, and one should also separate ""observance"" from ""belief"".  For older generations - much like for the Romans - physical observance: going to church, rituals, respecting the clergy, voting along religious lines - has been seen as essential in terms of proper behaviour and ""upholding public morality"".  Private belief is not particularly relevant.

For younger generations, self-expression and integrity are seen as greater virtues than compliance to an unfelt creed.  

So there will be a shift.  I also can't see it reverting, since knowledge is just too accessible now for the kind of religious brainwashing and control that we've seen ebb and flow in the past to recur.  We also have just too much scientific discovery available to us.  And greater communication, migration, tolerance and understanding between different cultures - we are much more exposed to what muslims believe, for example, than our parents or grandparents were - makes it far harder to sell a single, absolute creed.  

Even if you're an observant and charitable christian, it's very hard to shake hands with an observant and charitable muslim and genuinely believe they are going to hell.  I know that people do, but they are increasingly a minority.  And once you start thinking: ""well, obviously there must be more than one way to heaven, not just through Christ"" then a lot of other things start tumbling and crumbling.  At the very least you become more tolerant, and perhaps less likely to vote along religious lines.

""Genesis of the daleks"" is generally considered to be the start of the time war as the time lords try to destroy the daleks before they are created although ""remeberance of the daleks"" represents a serious escalation when the seventh doctor [spoiler](uses ancient time lord technology to trick the daleks into blowing up skaro) 

Although for my money, the First doctor story ""The chase"" is actually from near the end of the time war. Look at it this way, the Daleks use a tardis like time ship, where did they get that from? The daleks use time corridors, they can't build tardises, they must have nicked it from the time lords. Anyway, they use that to travel back in time to kill the doctor before he becomes a threat. It doesn't make sense otherwise, why would the daleks be so desperate to kill the doctor? He's only met them twice at this point. The daleks must have realised they can't beat the 8th? 9th? doctor and so decide to go back and have a go at one of the easier versions.

Also, the daleks in this story are the first ones to have self contained power sources, previous daleks relied on external power. Skip forward? backward? to Genesis of the daleks and now the very first daleks are built with self contained power sources, so it looks like daleks from the time war are giving themselves a boost by dropping davros hints on how to build better daleks.

true,Feint1,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,"&gt;Is there a movement to relax gun/knife laws?

Yes, but it's not large enough to get media attention.

Most of the national debate is around self defence. Labour is very much against people defending themselves with deadly force, but Conservatives want certain protections for home owners.

It's not a country with a large gun culture to begin with (at least not in the cities anyway, villages are notoriously gun loving).


&gt;Do you think the fact that people are not permitted to carry weapons in self defense contributes to petty crime/violence on the streets?

No, it would happen regardless.

&gt;Do you think that the riots last year might have been tempered had shop owners had the ability to defend their property with deadly force?

Too an extent. They probably would have ended up with more deaths and a similar level of damage though.

Most people would rather have given the police a green light to brutalise the criminals. Decades of police brutality regulation made the Met less effective.

&gt;Does the police force have some discretion in the enforcement of these laws? 

Yes.

----------------------------

The current laws are poorly thought out. You can legally own a cricket bat to beat an intruder to death with, but owning a taser is a criminal offence. 

People ignore the real problems, like cases of people being raped, tortured and murdered in their own homes. If these home owners had access to tasers they would have been able to protect their family.

The left will always counter this with cases of people who have died as a result of being shot by a taser. But the reality is that no one who intends on murdering a family has the right to complain when they are killed.

I generally favour more liberal weapons laws. People should be trusted not to break the law, they shouldn't be nannied by the state.

I don't know what forest it came from or who cut it, but I can't just rule out who or where. I don't know the answer, there is no evidence, so why would I assume? It doesn't affect the fact that it is 9 to 11 cm long

true,north0,null,null,"&gt;I personally don't see why they would be legal in any first world society.

I think it's difficult to argue that there are no legitimate uses for firearms. I live in the rural South as I mentioned, and there are plenty reasons to own a gun - hunting, varmint control on farm/property, shooting sports etc. 

&gt;however I'd argue the reverse, ordinary people aren't likely to possess a gun at all times - criminals however are

Not necessarily true. For example - [Florida] has over 800,000 licensed concealed carry permit holders, and you rarely ever heard about crime being committed with a weapon belonging to a permit holder. These people are subjected to a background check, training requirements etc. There are plenty of regular people who carry weapons without incident. 

&gt;I think instead of being a national event it would have been a national tragedy if we allowed Firearms to be legally possessed.

Just because people have access to firearms doesn't mean they will *necessarily* use them. I assume there is some sort of penalty associated with vandalizing a store window during a riot, and I assume there is some other penalty that is orders of magnitude greater associated with shooting a person. I also assume the latter would be more vigorously investigated by the police. 

The majority of the rioters were opportunists, taking advantage of the situation and lack of control the police exhibited - they weren't hardened criminals who would have killed people if only they had access to weapons. 

To me, the issue is that the police were ordered to [stand down](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/aug/09/uk-riots-police-tough-lockdown) during the riots - if your argument against firearm ownership is that the police have a monopoly on violence and they are there to defend you, then where does that leave you? The fact is that shop owners were not even given the *option* to defend their property and livelihood. 

There were plenty of well documented incidents in which shop owners successfully defended their property with firearms during the LA riots in 1992. It was by no means a blood bath, the rioters just steered clear of those shops with their owners standing on the roof with a rifle. 

I don't mean to be confrontational by any means, I am just trying to understand the perspective. I actually grew up in the UK (13 years in London) and my outlook on firearms was very similar to what I've seen in this thread - to be honest I don't really remember ever even thinking about it. I have since moved to a place where firearms are more a part of the culture for practical reasons and my thinking has changed dramatically.

They should be standing up for secular western values, not working as apologists for Islamic child rapists.

Left wing politics was born out of hostility to religion, and yet in present day Britain, people on the left naively support and defend the very thing that wishes to destroy them completely.

Islam is a major problem for the UK, it stands against everything good that Western society has stood for. It is a backwards, intolerant and dangerous religion that we are not only welcoming with open arms, but are also helping it to lay its roots. We are building massive mosques that will do nothing but help Islam become a political force in this country.

We'll end up with Islamic towns in this country, and unfortunately the people on the left still won't admit the real reasons as to why it's happened.

These people are the kind of people who would speak to a mugger as he's punching them in the face and be like ""oh it's so interesting that you feel the need to punch me in the face"" *SMACK* ""...I won't criticise you because I don't want to be culturally insensitive"" *SMACK* ""oh you've stolen my wallet! How interesting!""

I consider myself left wing by the way. But I'm also extremely hostile to religion and can see all these problems with Islam. I can see that Islam is a threat to our way of life and it's only going to get worse. I can also see that you pretty much can't openly say this anymore for fear of being called racist.

Bullshit.

People on the left need to wake up. The left should be attacking Islam and openly referring to these incidents of organised child rape as an Islamic/Asian problem, specifically. Because it is.

- Women's rights (All those women at universities defending Islam should stop to consider where they would be if we lived under Sharia law)
- Homosexual rights
- The rights of anyone who is not a muslim

The problem with Islam is that it is completely intolerant of all criticism. Look what happened when someone drew a fucking cartoon of Muhammed. People dead, across the world. People fucking died because someone drew a cartoon of Muhammed. Think about that. Think about what that means.

Islam, like Christianity, is a false religion, yet we are passing laws in this country that make it virtually impossible to say that publicly. Try saying that openly and your life with literally be under threat.

I come from a very hardcore atheist position by the way. I've been very harsh in my criticism of Christianity in the past, but Islam angers me for slightly different reasons.

Christianity is at least tolerant of criticism (in the UK at least), but Islam most certainly is not. We are passing laws (or people are trying to pass laws) in this country that more or less prohibit the criticism of religions such as Islam. It's ridiculous that I can't openly say I think Islam is a bullshit made up religion without fear of being arrested, but that is where we stand right now.

Islam is inherently hostile to not only other religions, but also to anyone who does not believe in Islam. It's a central, core part of their religion and is a running theme throughout the Koran, it's not just some fringe problem that only a few extremist bad eggs suffer from.

To greater understand my perspective on this one, let me outline my position for you:

I believe that both Christianity and Islam are man made social devices created by human beings as a means of controlling and manipulating other human beings. I believe that the human beings who created these religions in the first place wrote into them the means by which they would expand (which is why both Islam and Christianity are agressively preachy and try to expand). In other words, these religions were not created with the idea of co-existence in the first place. From the ground-up they were created to expand and conquer.

And yes, I do see Sharia Law as a real threat. I think that white people are so scared of being called racist that we allow this kind of thing to happen. There are Sharia courts already in this country, and they get tolerated because people are scared of what would happen if they were banned.

Why does it matter how many people are killed by guns in Britain? When you ban guns people use other tools (knives) to reach the same ends.

If Country A has 100 murders each year and Country B has 100 murders each year... the only difference being that mostly guns are used in A while mostly knives are used in B... would you argue that Country B is safer? Of course not, that's fucking retarded British logic.

I'm so sick of you idiots citing ""gun crime"" statistics rather than violent crime or overall homicide statistics. You're either incredibly stupid for not realizing why those statistics are irrelevant or you simply don't care.

&gt; Simple example: School shootings.

Oh my god! In a country of over 300 million people a half-dozen school kids die in a shooting each year! Ban all guns!

Ignore the fact that more kids could be saved every day of the fucking year if alcohol were banned.

My landlady just pops her head in if people are heavily complaining, if someone is leaving - she has to inspect this house and show the room,  or if something breaks - which usually generate a lot of complaints.

true,blue_strat,null,null,"If your money goes to Amazon, and they don't pay it in tax, then it will leave your local economy and possibly the national economy if not usefully reinvested in their UK operations.

If you give the money to a local business with local suppliers, it will stay in your area and improve profits and conditions locally, both through business and the local and national taxes they pay.

Obviously small shops cannot compete on price with massive companies that can sell high volume for low profit margins. But for every purchase you make with disposable income, you make a choice of where you want your money to go — to help local businesses develop your community, or to help inter/national businesses. A large business that doesn't pay tax may increase the spending power of consumers through low prices, but it won't be contributing to Government- or council-supported infrastructure.

Even if Amazon and the large chains did pay ""appropriate"" levels of tax, there is still a difference between physical and internet-based retail. If Tesco sets up a big store in a town and decides to contribute to local schools, and source their meat and veg from local farmers, then they can contribute to a local economy. But Amazon doesn't have the physical connection that prompts such relationships. They can decide to give portions of their profits to Cancer Research on awareness days, but they don't localise to the point of addressing individual communities.

Some places in the US you need binoculars just to see traces of civilisation.

Probably the reason why the US doesn't legislate further against it, is that very reason. The UK is significantly smaller, and with relatively aggressive expansion, the arse end of nowhere is getting harder to find, so chance criminals are finding it harder to get access to firearms.  
Obviously, there'll always be a hardened aspect that'll get hold of a gun, no matter what controls you put in as well.


Also, the other thing to bear in mind is the constitution that you always bang on about. I believe it's the ""right to bear arms, as part of an organised Militia, being a necessity in guaranteeing a free state""?

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"So my brother (also a Spurs fan) and I have had this conversation multiple times. I'll skip the long version and go to the highlights;

It's easy to forget he's only 28, still in his prime years. He can easily play for 6-10 more years. He's also one of the 5 or 10 best strikers in the world, absolutely unstoppable when he's on his game. His problem has always been that he's moody and doesn't always play his best. Which is fair, but he also commands so much attention that he opens up the field for the rest of the team.

Adebayor has said that his wage demands are so high because of the Charity work he does in Togo, so I'm hopeful that if we did buy him, Levy might be able to swing a deal where Spurs give money to charities at his direction, or help him set up a foundation; this allows him to keep doing charitable work, while also not driving up our wage bill.

The bottom line for me is this; I don't want his current contract, but I do want him as a player. He's very very good. Should we looking in Llorente or Damiao or other options? Of course.

End Clothing is another good one, stocks lots of nice brands (including hard to get American ones) but again, very pricey.

Aspecto also delivers i think? Similar to Oi Polloi in its products.

Mr Porter delivers and has some nice stuff, but it's very expensive again, especially the blazers.

I actually agree with you on this. Even in ""gun friendly"" states over here, most people own at least one handgun and have the legal right to carry it... but are too lazy to do so on a frequent basis. They only carry when they feel especially concerned for their safety; to me this is like only wearing a seatbelt when you're expecting to be in an accident.

*If you are a warrior who is legally authorized to carry a weapon and you step outside without that weapon, then you become a sheep, pretending that the bad man will not come today. No one can be “on” 24/7 for a lifetime. Everyone needs down time. But if you are authorized to carry a weapon, and you walk outside without it, just take a deep breath, and say this to yourself... “Baa.”*

I think our real problem is if one of Cahill or Luiz cannot play. We will be in great shape with both of them since they are both quality players, recent injury or not. But without one of them, Bosingwa will be a major step down at CB (despite his great play lately), and we would not have a single player on the roster who can adequately play RB.

&gt;'They' get rowdy? Who are they? Doctors, lawyers, air mechs or environmental health techs? Do you routinely generalise tens of thousands of people based on the behaviour of a few?

I grew up in a town next to a hub of servicemen, a great deal of businesses explicitly ban uniform because of the kick off I describe, this isn't me pushing an agenda it's a proper fact that can be verified in a great deal of towns and cities nationwide.

&gt;How rowdy do 'they'you get that shops and hospitals feel the need to deny them service. I attended hospital with a broken leg and had to remove my uniform and sit with a sheet around me to avoid offending the lovely people of Leicester.

Well, that's fucking horrible, I'm sorry you recieved such shoddy service.

&gt;Why the fuck should they get up, put on civvies, drop off kids, get changed again. Work, changed again, pick up kids. Pop out for lunch? Get changed? Fuck that.

Maybe an informal dress code on the home front would be more pragmatic, I dunno, I'm not the one calling you all cunts.

&gt;What agency is it that is immoral? UK plc?

Don't be a prick about it. Your facetiousness is deliciously close to the mark. Yes, the cunts that sent you and your bros to shoot up some afghan warlords and decimate Iraq because of global power struggles.

true,north0,null,null,"&gt;it's arguable that it's easier for criminal aspects to get firearms illegally, especially with the vast tracks of fuck-all-ness you have. Some places in the US you need binoculars just to see traces of civilisation.

But most gun crime occurs in inner-cities and very urban areas like Detroit, Chicago, New Jersey, Delaware, LA etc. 

&gt; I believe it's the ""right to bear arms, as part of an organised Militia, being a necessity in guaranteeing a free state""? There's probably some context missing (and I haven't had the damn thing tattooed on the inside of my eyeballs like some), but I don't see any organised militias in the US?

Organized militias exist. But the point is that it takes away absolute power from the government. The government will never be able to have complete authoritative power over its citizens because the population is so heavily armed. It probably could subdue the population if it really wanted to - assuming the military remained loyal - but it would come at a huge cost. 

If the British government decided tomorrow to seize power absolutely and enact some sort of fascist dictatorship, is there really anything the citizens could do about it? 

This sort of thing seems far fetched, but I think that's just because we've been lucky in the West for the last couple centuries to live in relative autonomy with relatively liberal governments that respect the rights of their citizens for the most part. But major parts of the world are still absolutely subject to arbitrary rule by dictatorships, so I think it's important to retain some sort of perspective.

HBO is an American company. They actually made Game of Thrones, the TV series, despite it being largely shot in Northern Ireland. Now here's the thing: they then sell the TV series to broadcasters in other countries. The one who bids highest gets it exclusively. This is how HBO can afford to work purely off subscription. They have the huge revenues coming in from other national broadcasters who buy their programs. In the UK we have either the BBC or Sky. None of the others have the monetary power. Sky has more money so they outbid the BBC to buy up all the decent American TV shows.

The BBC would never pay to air such a risky fantasy series. Even HBO themselves didn't know whether it would be received well. Sky however, can afford to do so, just like they outbid the BBC on the Formula 1.

The subscription is payment for regular access to the standard service, the adverts are payment for access to a series that Sky have had to buy. They do not receive their programs for free, they have to buy them from the original producers.

In regards to their business model, since the NewsCorp scandal broke they have been making significant changes - to their credit - but it is mainly out of fear of losing customers. 

1) Sky Go was launched as a pc, smartphone and tablet application. 
2) They have recently changed it so you can access Sky Anytime+ even if you aren't with Sky on your Broadband package. 
3) They've been buying up all the decent programs from America for ages anyway so you have access to a bigger variety of stuff. 
4) They changed it so you can subscribe to just Sky Go. This allows you to watch all the major football programs on your pc, iphone or tablet without paying the full prices of a Sky Subscription. If you have some basic tech knowledge, you can even launch Sky Go on a laptop/PC and connect it via HD cable to your TV and watch the football on your large TV screen via Sky Go.

They even had the rights for The Wire, Channel 4 having the rights for The Sopranos. Sky Antantic has come along, and they seem to be buying the right to show American (and even joint ventures that the BBC and HBO have a history of doing) even if they are shit, they are effectively shooting fish in a barrel. Also repeating HBO series that terrestial tv has already showed (Six Feet Under comes to mind). 

I know sky do not often fill their programming with original Sky made content, but I still find that they are able to double their income from subs and adverts obnoxious.

It was Dicken's time, albeit a time where a stroke would fucking kill him.

Perhaps she's the most comfortable with watching death *because* of that.

Subsidies of all types need to go. They are one of the reasons food prices are so distorted http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007-2008_world_food_price_crisis

Before anyone starts with the think of the farmers bullshit, I would like to add I am a farmer and the only subsidy we claim is the ELS, we managed to run a small but relatively succesful suckler herd. We are never going to be rich but we are not on the breadline either.

Oh and it is also very nice of the BBC to not put things in perspective

DEFRA says ""Successive UK government have been opposed to capping payments. This is because to avoid losing subsidies, bigger farms would restructure and the only gainers would be lawyers.""

The BBC kindly left it at that but they did not state, that just capping our farmers would not do any good, particularly as in other countries there are many more small farmers as opposed to here where it is mainly large farmers. in fact succesive governments have been more inclined to do away with subsidies and work directly on environmental aspects http://www.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/farm-manage/cap-reform/",0,1336867758,null,0,false,0,c4nbyen,t3_tjyxn,t1_c4nbyen,t3_tjyxn,null,1428912751,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

She also had a boyfriend when she met him. I like Mickey, but she immediately ditches him. Sure, he's no Doctor but bloody hell she moved on fast.

Lets move the argument to things we actually know nothing about. There is no proof so far that there is alien life outside our world. So do you then decide firmly that there is no alien life? Why would your default position be that there isn't?

Your teapot argument is based on thing that is almost clearly untrue. You're making me out to say this:

*""You cannot disprove the existence of something that is &lt;clearly untrue&gt;, therefore why would you have an opinion either way?""*

When I am actually saying this:

*""You cannot disprove the existence of something that &lt;we have no knowledge of or no way to measure&gt;, therefore why would you have an opinion either way""*

 You may have never since a poor farmer but you have to take into account they are cash poor, asset rich in general. I don't mean the massive farmers farming 2000ha. This is the issue the whole subsidy has to go, look at wheat prices over the past 20 years (wheat is an ideal indicator of food prices as opposed to oil) they have fluctuated so much that even if you sell your product at peak times you lose out later this causes cash issues for many farmers. Also due to the nature of the job its relatively difficult to just hold on to stock until ""the price is right"" a calf becomes a cow if left too long add to that they eat shit loads.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"I met the queen at a party at Buckingham Palace in 1983. She was actually really nice (although everyone around her were cunts, and I get the later impression this is deliberate to make her look great). While I didn't get to have intercourse with her for the purposes of procreation, the general view I got from her was that she was really an incredibly nice woman and I'd hate to upset her.

By contrast, in the mid-70s I met princess margaret who was a completely different kettle of fish. She was a woman of incredible joie-de-vivre (I doubt I spelt that right) but was definitely someone very erm... unlimited. I guess that's the phrase. I didn't mention her to the queen when I met her nor her to the queen (having not met the queen yet), but I could see that H.M. Queen would not have been impressed if I had told that I had spent time with her sister and found H.M. Queen more 'uptight'. Having said that it was quite something to have met her. It contradicts greatly with my views on what is the fair distribution of wealth for example, but I'm glad I met them both.

true,skinnyhulk,eng-kent,Kent,"Tenant farmers should be treated the same way as high street however, they are not because of several reasons:

* 
Rent prices for agric land are highly variable for example grade 1 land averages out at 150% more per year to rent than grade 2 or 3 land (http://www.smithsgore.co.uk/news-smiths-gore/agricultural-rent-database-26741)
* 
Farmers of all types are price takers not price givers, for example if the price to produce a t-shirt goes up the high street will pass that on to customer. However farmers cannot do that as the speculators, granaries and wholesalers just go somewhere else
* 
Due to the seasonality of farming, supply exceeds demand at certain times of the year (spring lamb)
* 
Not enough ""vertical integration"". Most farmers never sell direct to the customer
* 
Location it is harder to grow wheat in Wales then it is in the East of England, however it is easier to produce milk in the west as opposed to the East (rainfall) this makes it very difficult for individual small farmers to negotiate contracts

&gt;long term contracts with supermarkets and other retailers? 


Most definately, but most farmers cannot/will not use long term contracts, as you nearly always get screwed, the problem with long-term contracts is the buyer always pushes the price down and the grower does not have enough clout to push the price up (only exceptions are with very specialist crops, such as vipers bugloss)
Also change is happening now, soon the supermarkets will be directly fined in law for treating suppliers like shit (how strong this law will be we will have to wait and see)
&gt;aren't some farmers switching their grain to use as biofuels


This is a myth that seems to have spread. If farmers starting planting bio fuels then that would cause the price of food to rise as they would NOT be growing foods
A prime example of this is Oilseed Rape, many moons ago the price of OSR was VERY high, so all the farmers started growing it, this caused the price to plummet massively. So by now I reckon your thinking about quotas, well they frankly do not work as you guessed it speculators come in and fuck it all up again, dairycrest, unigate and so on. We used to have the Milk Marketing Board, which was actually quite good (it dictated prices) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_Marketing_Board however due to current EU trade legislation we would not be allowed to have it back as our government is not allowed to manipulate the market in direct competition with other countries (self-subsidy, fucking complicated legislation)

With regards to better infrastructure for the industry, that is not going to happen with the publics general perception of food in general, the I want strawberries in December crowd et al

Also the EU market is too big for them to logistically dictate prices as the cost of living between the countries is so different.
But many farmers do get together and form cooperatives and machinary rings to improve their buying and selling power, sadly they are not quite big enough (there are a few exceptions)

In truth it is a very difficult and complex subject, same as with the tenant farmers, people forget that for businesses to work and work well and effeciently they need competition, and currently there is no competition within europe for the farmers (due in part to subsidies). An example is this many dairy farmers contracts are tied in such a way that the farmer is not allowed to reveal the price per litre of milk he is recieving to the press, or the contract is cancelled and fines must be paid, the milk buyers are smart, they know exactly how much they can squeeze the market, this is basically price fixing.

The NFU are very effective, but they cannot compete with the scale of the many problems facing UK farming as most of it is EU bollocks. On the one hand we have the sheer ineptitude of DEFRA (quick to punish slow to fix) the cock up that is the Rural Payments Agency who miscalculated and mess up many farmers subsidies, this year, last year and every year since their inception and you have the EU regs (double tagging, microchipping), negative press with regards to food production and basically farming is not big enough in this country to get the attention IMO as to which it deserves.

But overall the Doctor's not relied on stumbling upon people and making friends. In fact for a while his companions were stowaways and accidental partners. Sometimes he isn't really looking for a friend.

But you make a point. Like Donna noted in ""The Runaway Bride"" sometimes the Doctor needs someone to tell him when he's going too far. It's possible that he trusts his companions to keep him in check.

Interestingly like all of the other's fears (Amy waiting, the Weeping Angels attacking) people's fears are what they hope their faith will protect them from.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"There's a really superb bit written by Orwell about this, if you'll excuse the long quotation:

&gt; And with this [gentleness] goes something that is always written off by European observers as ‘decadence’ or hypocrisy, the English hatred of war and militarism. It is rooted deep in history, and it is strong in the lower-middle class as well as the working class. Successive wars have shaken it but not destroyed it. Well within living memory it was common for ‘the redcoats’ to be booed at in the streets and for the landlords of respectable public houses to refuse to allow soldiers on the premises. In peace time, even when there are two million unemployed, it is difficult to fill the ranks of the tiny standing army, which is officered by the country gentry and a specialized stratum of the middle class, and manned by farm labourers and slum proletarians. The mass of the people are without military knowledge or tradition, and their attitude towards war is invariably defensive. No politician could rise to power by promising them conquests or military ‘glory’, no Hymn of Hate has ever made any appeal to them. In the last war the songs which the soldiers made up and sang of their own accord were not vengeful but humorous and mock-defeatist(1). The only enemy they ever named was the sergeant-major.

&gt; In England all the boasting and flag-wagging, the ‘Rule Britannia’ stuff, is done by small minorities. The patriotism of the common people is not vocal or even conscious. They do not retain among their historical memories the name of a single military victory. English literature, like other literatures, is full of battle-poems, but it is worth noticing that the ones that have won for themselves a kind of popularity are always a tale of disasters and retreats. There is no popular poem about Trafalgar or Waterloo, for instance. Sir John Moore's army at Corunna, fighting a desperate rearguard action before escaping overseas (just like Dunkirk!) has more appeal than a brilliant victory. The most stirring battle-poem in English is about a brigade of cavalry which charged in the wrong direction. And of the last war, the four names which have really engraved themselves on the popular memory are Mons, Ypres, Gallipoli and Passchendaele, every time a disaster. The names of the great battles that finally broke the German armies are simply unknown to the general public.

&gt; The reason why the English anti-militarism disgusts foreign observers is that it ignores the existence of the British Empire. It looks like sheer hypocrisy. After all, the English have absorbed a quarter of the earth and held on to it by means of a huge navy. How dare they then turn round and say that war is wicked?

&gt; It is quite true that the English are hypocritical about their Empire. In the working class this hypocrisy takes the form of not knowing that the Empire exists. But their dislike of standing armies is a perfectly sound instinct. A navy employs comparatively few people, and it is an external weapon which cannot affect home politics directly. Military dictatorships exist everywhere, but there is no such thing as a naval dictatorship. What English people of nearly all classes loathe from the bottom of their hearts is the swaggering officer type, the jingle of spurs and the crash of boots. Decades before Hitler was ever heard of, the word ‘Prussian’ had much the same significance in England as ‘Nazi’ has today. So deep does this feeling go that for a hundred years past the officers of the British army, in peace time, have always worn civilian clothes when off duty.",0,1336882737,null,0,false,0,c4neeux,t3_tk4r2,t1_c4neeux,t3_tk4r2,null,1428913903,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17

Except guns aren't the only variable. What about the fact that the US is far more diverse than the UK?

2008-2009 the Royal family cost the UK tax payer about £42 million right? 

(http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8124022.stm). 

So when considered that tourism in the UK is worth something like £96 billion the royal family's expense is virtually nothing.

I wonder how much of that would be left if there was no royal family and tourist coming to see the '£1 million hat'? The Royals with their cost are directly responsible for around £200 million so that means they actually make us £160 million a year. In fact here's a handy little video to explain:

Mirrors don't hold an image, they are a reflection--a false image. Otherwise the angels in the city would cause a new angel from every piece of semi-reflective (Depending on optics, refraction) glass, water, or other surface. The fact that two angels in the city were able to operate and move around means they can either do it blind, or be able to see their own reflection in glass.

Also, it is fairly safe to say that all intelligent life is able to identify that a [reflection is themself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test). From Blink we know that they can look at themselves: hands in front of eyes when working in packs.

Can an angel process information (Observe) while it's in it's stone form? If it can, mirrors are useless anyway. It will figure out through the mirror test that it is themselves, or they would simply see stone. If it can't observe in stone form, then the ending of Blink wouldn't have worked out (1 can't observe 4, so 4 reverts back. 4 was watching 3, so it covers it's eyes. 3 can now revert back and release 2...etc).

This ignores the fact that the canon was changed with 11, where they could be 'tricked', treating the quantum lock like a conscious decision and not a reflex. But they also could move en masse without covering their eyes. The comforting reassurance I give myself is that the recent angels were fully powered, and not the 'scavengers' they were in Blink.

However, what would happen if we kept an angel under video surveillance then put a monitor with the video with a 5 second loop facing the angel. Does the image of the angel become a NEW entity? Or is it simply the same angel by proxy? If it becomes a new angel, they lock each other. If it's a proxy then it goes back to the whole mirror thing. I lean to the angel by proxy status due to the fact that when the angels were sucked into the crack, the one in Amy's head was no longer there even though she had a memory of it. The only way it could have left is if the source was no longer existing.

true,Learnincurve,derbyshire,Peak District,"Historian here: The way I would go about it would be to first get a working template up on your site using the churches from your area, make it so other people can add to it. Obviously you would need to find a web savvy person willing to do this side of the work, I am sure there would be web designers willing to help you. The key is to make it look as professional as possible to give the whole thing *respectability*.  Trust me there is a very good chance you will find yourself dealing with some crusty old Luddites and that will be key.
I would go for a church wiki thing myself, slightly different to what you want I think but most people have heard of wikipedia.

 Then contact the church of England and tell them about your project and ask for a list of all churches and help. The real bitch here will be finding out who the hell is the right person to talk to about it, in fact it might be quicker to drive to the nearest cathedral and ask to talk to a bishop in person. (wear a suit)  Depending on who you talk to you will either just get a list or every vicar in the county getting *involved* and telling congregations about ""this marvellous new project"". (The church is rather keen on being seen as modern). Once you get your list you can then say ""the C of E gave me a list"" to other religious institutions, such as the Methodists and the catholic church and ask for help. 

Then you hit the Christian internet forums and announce your project and say religious organisations X T and Z  have been very helpful.  

That's all I can think of right now :)

Edit: I should mention that the reason I would talk to the church is that most churches are locked when church services are not on, if you have some sort of collective legitimacy then doors, quite literally, will be opened to you.

true,skinnyhulk,eng-kent,Kent,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_the_United_Kingdom#Economics

As for you saying own lots of land, do no farming etc, that would not benefit the landowner that much due to cross compliance, the land must still be farmed, even if it is done using extensive systems. Also the subsidy per acre recieved is much lower than the cost to buy an acre. For example,  for ease of arithmetic say the subsidy payment was £500 per acre, the cost to purchase that same piece of land would mean the acre price would be over £2000 per acre. You would end up with a spiraling effect where the more money per acre in subsidies would drive up the land price. Who is going to sell land when they can make money off of it for little effort.

And as I have said in other posts, farmers are cash poor asset rich, hell if you sold every single item you owned you would probably have a pretty penny in cash.

Farmers are price takers not givers, we do not dictate the price that someone can purchase our products for, sadly the supermarkets and dictators do that. I urge you to read up a bit more on it, or if you have any questions please ask.
The conspiracy theories saying rich farmers are just trying to get control of the food are just bollocks, most farmers work on the land because they actually enjoy the work, job and lifestyle, they just want fairer pay.",0,1336905959,null,0,false,0,c4nguvw,t3_tjyxn,t1_c4nguvw,t1_c4ngjn4,null,1428915122,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

[1] A self published, non-peer reviewed paper whose conclusions are a crude personal appeal to parsimony.  Written by an author who does not appear on the institutions staff list (suggesting a students project).

[2] Actually quite interesting, but in no way pertains to the idea that our universe is a simulation.

Your original claim remains completely without justification.

&gt;so why would your default position be that there is no butter?

Doesn't matter why, the position is one of faith.  If we were being pragmatic though we can bring in inductive reasoning and say ""most fridges I have examined (say 80%) in my experience contain butter, ergo it is more likely than not that this new fridge contains butter.""  We still have no knowledge of course.  But the butter example is not a good analogy for teapots or gods because physical evidence is something that's readily available.

&gt;There is no proof so far that there is alien life outside our world. So do you then decide firmly that there is no alien life? Why would your default position be that there isn't?

There is some rather striking evidence that there is life in this universe so the existence of alien life is not just possible, but plausible. You then need to proceed from plausible to probable (cf Drake equation).  Deciding firmly either way is to do so without any knowledge of what's true, most scientists word their hypothesis that there is alien life very carefully to avoid this but they will of course state that it's a position of belief or conjecture at this point and not one of scientific certainty by any stretch.

&gt;Your teapot argument is based on thing that is almost clearly untrue. 

*Almost* being the operative word, but it's not as if we cannot imagine possible circumstances for a teapot being there.  We are capable of launching objects towards the orbit of Mars.  Perhaps it was left there by an ancient civilisation.  The fact is we live in a universe where teapots exist and it would be possible to place a teapot in an orbit around Mars (which contrasts nicely with the god question which has no establishment in reality of any kind and so has all it's work ahead of it if it's to be taken seriously).

&gt;""You cannot disprove the existence of something that &lt;we have no knowledge of or no way to measure&gt;, therefore why would you have an opinion either way""

Well if it prevents this hangup I'll make it easier for you:  Thor, Zeus, Allah, Shiva, Ra, Set, Flaying Spaghetti Monster etc.  You must clearly have no opinion on the existence of these unmeasurable entities that have been created by hallucinating and/or mentally ill humans over thousands of years.

I can make something up, right now, that has absolutely no basis in reality or fact of any kind.

It's quite sad - but true - that Australia and New Zealand mean almost nothing to ""modern Britain"". In fact ""modern Britain"" finds Australia and New Zealand highly offensive and routinely regard these countries as ""racist"" in spite of being settled by ""the British"".

What are we trying to say? I guess we're admitting that ""modern Britain"" is hostile to - let's be honest - ""white British"". And by rejecting Australia and New Zealand ""modern Britain"" rejects ""historical Britain"" and the descendants thereof.

Australians/New Zealanders that come to Britain looking for a taste of their ancestral roots find a very different ""modern Britain"" that is completely unrecognisable from the cultural ancestral stories passed down through the generations.

""Only if nomination is by the political parties.""

""In a true Senate the appointments would not be by the parties, hence no (overt) party supporters. And even party supporters, freed from the shackles of the whip, will rebel when they believe they are right.""

Okay but what would be the alternative then, specifically? If you could please elaborate, I'd be interested.

""I agree. And for this reason I do not yet reject the idea of a faith component to the Senate. However, although religious extremism comes from many quarters, all of it can be shot down (metaphorically speaking) by good reasoning. And I would suggest, therefore, does not require particular insight but merely an understanding of human nature.""

You're using rationality in a political context. Hmm. Whilst I agree to an extent, it's not very likely. I'm saying this act was clearly a way of balancing things in a very public way. Whilst it does have its uses practically, who knows what you can expect. Sorry I was playing Devil's Advocate there. Much as you were earlier I expect.

""Further, 'meritocratically elected' is a largely contradictory conjunction.""

Perhaps I should have said appointed then. But at any rate I've heard countless times how experts are deservedly needed in parliament, based on merit it seems. And all of them based on personal opinion. This is why we elections to find the one that the most people prefer. 

""What they must represent is good reasoning.""

Yeah..

There are also many other subsidies that farmers can claim for, you have HLS, ELS and many more. With a new farmer, if he owns the land but does not have entitilement, the person holding that entitlement may still not be able to claim SFP.

This is why the CAP is so useless, basically the SFP is just stocks and shares in the countryside.

As someone who had a weird mole go strange quite recently I got an appointment with my GP the same day I called, and an appointment with a hospital dermatologist the same week, who removed the thing inside of 10minutes. This was free as I'm a British citizen, however you would probably have to pay for the hospital visit up front even if the GP visit is free.

When my appendix burst one night at 2 in the morning and I drove myself to A&amp;E, out of the 5 or so patients there, the nurses told me I was the *only* legit one.

There was a guy with a sprained ankle who thought he'd go because it's ""quicker"" than going to the doctors, there was a young girl who'd blacked out drunk and had been rushed in by ambulance (nothing wrong with her either), there was a violent drunk who had to be bought in by police, and a tramp who likes somewhere to sleep.

I was awestruck, I cannot believe the way some people take the NHS for granted in this country. And some people have the gall to complain about an £8 prescription charge!

Charge the drunken idiots who waste the ambulance and hospital staff's time, and don't charge them lightly either.

Tell them when you phone up about your US insurance and I'm sure they'll know exactly how it works and will be happy to bill them.

The first price I saw with a private GP was £170 without annual membership which is £80.  I'd definitely call the local NHS GP first but if you'd rather just get it seen to and money's not a problem then there are plenty of private GPs in London and they'll have fast track dermatologists too if it calls for it.  If you tell them over the phone they may even book you straight into a dermatologist.

================

I did a second google search for ""London private walk in doctor"" and one came up with clinics in ""Moorgate, Liverpool Street, Bank and other Locations"" with prices starting at £30.  If you're in Zone 1 anyway you don't get much more convenient than that and they all seem to be advertising that they'll see you on that day.

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"I think race can be ignored. It's the culture which is probably the most appropriate thing to talk about. The colour of the mens skin has nothing to do with it, it's not as if, because they're asian, they're somehow more likely to go out and run a sex ring, and i don't think their religion makes this more likely either. It's more the culture which surrounds the negative aspects of these religions and their religious texts which is important. Not every muslim male is going to go out and run a sex ring, and i don't think most peoples interpretations of Islam is the problem here, i just think it's the (for want of a better word) extremists who take these teachings from the Qur'an and use them to justify these acts. Then again, we don't even know if these men DID use the Qur'an to justify anything, instead maybe they used some of the Qur'an (male dominance over women) to justify their beliefs and then act on those beliefs by commiting these crimes.

Anyways i think i rambled there, i hope people get what i'm saying.

Basically:

Race = not an issue.

Religion = not an issue.

Culture that stems from the teachings of certain parts of that religion = the problem.

&gt;If we assume that the reason behind these crimes is the religion of the suspects, the problem is with a specific cultural/ideological subset of a specific religion.

I've had my fill thanks very much, we've got enough youngsters on our team in enough positions to carry us on through injury or suspensions.

I want a fucking striker who can put the ball in the back of the net, who's done it for several seasons and who can hit double digits BEFORE New Year. Dempsey sounds.. reasonable. Honestly not many others in that position who *would* move to Liverpool.

I want a DM who can rotate with Lucas while he recovers from injury. Its unreasonable to ask him to play every game next season and Spearing has been crap while Shelvey should be loaned out again. Diame sounds a good option on free transfer but his wage demands of 60,000 a week are a little.. odd.. I'd like your opinions on if he's worth it.

I want a quality right winger. I don't know who, I don't know for how much, but we need one badly. We have plan A of Downing crossing to Caroll but we need plan B of pace and trickery and Suarez can't do it by himself. Andy is starting to learn the game a little more now but its not his game. pace, trickery, I would suggest Shaun Wright Phillips but I've lost interest in him after all the clubs he's bounced around from.

Can we PLEASE buy Madrid and Man City burn outs? They always play better after they leave their club.

I'm for freedom of religion in that I do not believe people should be forced by law to believe in a certain thing or to not believe in a certain thing, but I am also against the building of places like mosques. Muslims can pray at home, they don't need a mosque to pray.

I've written elsewhere that I believe that both Christianity and Islam are man made social devices created by human beings as a means of controlling and manipulating other human beings. The human beings that created these religions in the first place wrote into them the means by which they would spread - believers are told to preach and to be intolerant of non-believers. 

In other words, these religions were designed from the ground up, by the people who created them, to expand and conquer, not to simply co-exist. Building mosques gives religions like Islam a solid root and a base from which to further expand. You can't demolish a mosque once you've built it, because Muslims are retarded psychopaths that will literally murder the people involved if they dare to do it (and before you even try to call me ""racist"" or whatever for pointing out the truth, dare I remind you what happened when someone dared to draw a fucking cartoon of their prophet Muhammed? Yeah, death all around the world. Try knocking a mosque down once it's been built. You wouldn't dare).

We are seeing some huge mosques now in this country, and Islam is only going to become stronger as a political force. There will be muslim towns in this country before too long, and Sharia courts will start becoming a bigger problem than they already are as well.

I personally would love to see the majority of mosques demolished for these reasons, but because the consequence of demolishing these mosques would be carnage, murder and suicide bombs all over the place, I'd settle for putting a stop to building new ones.

I'm ecstatic that you were so moved by the Beautiful Game that you're helping support it in your local area, and my goddamn nipples are erect that a new fan has chosen the Spurs banner as their own.

Having said all that, I wish you wouldn't sign off with ""Fuck Arsenal."" Why? Are you from Tottenham? What basis do you have to say that? Somebody told you you're supposed to?

We all love a rivalry, we all love banter, but - and this is just me talking - please try to keep your banter and insults a little above the ""fuck em"" line. Have a look at [/r/gunners](http://www.reddit.com/r/gunners). See all the ""Fuck Spurs"" posts right now for their precious St. Totteringham Day? Don't they look like a bunch of idiots while they do that? I see exactly one thread lauding their team and fans for their support over a very difficult season, a half dozen talking about how shit we are.

I rally for derbies, I'll make fun of Gooners, but most of all I love my team (teams, really, since I'm from across the water and support my local and national with every bit of the enthusiasm I throw out for the Spurs) and I want to portray a better image than those guys are showing for Arsenal.",0,1336944793,null,0,true,0,c4nmhbe,t3_tl3zx,t1_c4nmhbe,t1_c4nl056,null,1428917772,0,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,0

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"I think we can ignore the religious aspect of it in a larger sense. Sure these guys were Muslim, but i don't think this means we need to paint Islam as a religion which advocates this kind of thing. The cultural issue i'm talking about is a culture in which these guys (who all were in an area which had businesses open very late) were able to prey on these young girls (who were all out near these businesses at these late times) without fear of repercussion because of a possible wall of silence. I am just wary of people (read: BNP and EDL) using this (they already are) as a way to demozine ordinary people who practise Islam. This, instead, should be seen as a group of men who used ideas in the Qur'an (if they even did!) to justify their behaviour. Their behaviour wasn't caused by their religion, the way they read their religion helped them justify their behaviour (dominance over women in the Qur'an etc.)

It's kind of like Catholic Priests abusing children. That doesn't somehow mean we should demonize all ordinary Catholics, and i fear that this may be what happens here.

Edit: Also i think there's a problem with a culture in which a young girl can talk about the abuse she has suffered and not be believed because of the stigma attached to being in care.

I have first hand experience on how it is to be treated by the care system, and some of it is absolutely disgusting. Many people in the care system here in the UK just aren't believed when they talk about issues they have at their new foster home, because they've been labelled as 'messed up' or 'crazy' just because they've been put into this position by their often abuse parents. They're also severely reprimanded for wanting to have any independence, which i think can cause even more problems as these kids lash out as they try and escape overbearing foster parents who are scared of the kids getting into trouble because it gets the foster parents themselves into trouble. I don't know the specifics of what was said but if a 13(?) year old girl can talk about being raped to her carers (i think this girl was in care, but if she was not then ignore this entire paragraph i guess) and not be taken seriously by a careworker (she should have passed that info on so it could be investiaged) then i think there's been a massive failing on the part of the government and the way it handles foster children and children in the care system.",0,1336946767,null,0,true,0,c4nmu79,t3_tlb58,t1_c4nmu79,t1_c4nmrnf,null,1428917940,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

But then doing nothing would have opened them up to attacks from their own party/base and reducing it to 40% again would have made the left howl. There really were no good options with that one.

One thing that is important to remember is that when an administration gets into office, the government doesn't really change much. And learning how the government operates is going to take some time, because the byzantine complex that is the government doesn't really operate in a way that is easy for anyone to understand. There was an interesting article in the Standard which covered just [this topic](http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/comment/comment/camerons-guru-has-lost-patience-with-the-status-quo-7537225.html). And you have to remember that this is the first time we've had a new government in the digital era, with rolling 24/7 news coverage provided not only by TV, but by a myriad of blogs, real time feeds, forums etc. Combine that with a laundry list of serious problems facing the country, quite a few of which are external issues and not something the new administration can actually control, that this lot are mostly new to actual office, and it's far harder for the new guys to cover up the fact that they honestly have no idea how to operate the machinery of government. If Labour doesn't win the next election, and is forced to do a complete redesign of the top end of their party as a result, we'll see exactly the same thing. However, if they do get in to power again they will do do with a team of people who have been in office before.

Thankfully though we have so much more variety nowadays and can focus on things that are tailored to our individual tastes. There's absolutely nothing wrong with demanding something better than the middle of the bell-curve of entertainment, choose something that many people dislike or don't get but a smaller subset including yourself think is amazing.

For example the Canadian show *How It's Made* should float my boat and I do enjoy it, but as a tinkerer huge industrial processes are far less interesting to me than lo-fi hackery so I find *The Secret Life of Machines* much more enjoyable.
