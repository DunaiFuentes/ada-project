That's like saying the leader of the UAF is linked to Stalin's purges because they believe in in largely the same things.

&gt; I keep hearing this slander against UAF, that they're violent. UAF has signatures from everyone, all different members of society, all three main parties. Even Cameron, for all his many faults, has signed it.

The UAF had signatures from people many years ago. Martin Smith the assistant secretary of the UAF now claims David Cameron is a racist (lol). People just assumed they were a group that stood against racism, yet that's no longer the case.

&gt; So UAF in general obviously aren't thugs

You need to look into groups such as Antifa.

&gt; and if they have violent members, well shit: they are just some of their members. The EDL is a street movement, it's purpose is to intimidate communities. If anti-fascists are there to start violence, it's with these racist bastards who frankly have brought it upon themselves

true,InsufferableTwat,null,null,"I can see why you think that. My feelings on this are complicated, for all sorts of reasons. I'll keep this as brief as I can.

It kind of depends whether we mean ""capitalism"" as a system that describes how free market (ish) economics works, or as some sort of politic-economic ideal that we should aspire to. I think it works very well as the former. The trouble is, people - especially Americans - mistake capitalism as an *objective* to be aimed at. It isn't, it's a system, not a goal in itself.

As a system, it doesn't have *ends*. And it doesn't *necessarily* work towards human advancement, although it *can* do a lot to help it, and has done. 

When a company director makes decisions which are in the interests of his shareholders, but flatly against the national interest, that's not a bad director. His job is to maximise profit for shareholders. If he looked out for the country he'd be doing something else. 

Similarly, the managers that work for a large company are geared to the same thing. The nature of capitalism on a large scale, is that the providers of the Capital expect a return for it. That means the system has to pass something (money) upwards and out of itself.

I don't personally care particularly whether companies are foreign owned. But as someone who works in rural communities, I can see that large contractors (e.g. in farming and forestry) result in money being sucked out of local areas, which results in local contractors and other businesses suffering. If all of a large company's profits are going to the Cayman Islands I imagine there's a similar effect, but as it's in the wider economy, we don't perceive it directly. 

Capitalism constrained by regulation and a sensible political system is probably the best way of feeding 7bn people. I don't have any better ideas that I honestly think would work. 

However unconstrained capitalism has - pretty much by definition - no capacity for forward planning. There are finite resources, which (whatever you think of the politics) can't be made infinite by the clever use of words. When these start to run out (I'm mainly thinking of peak oil, but there are other examples) the best capitalism can do is provide an economic incentive to find a solution. It can't guarantee that a solution *exists* or will be found in time to avert a disaster.

Really? Without even arguing the correctness of sending men to fight in the Falklands, the Balkans, Iraq etc. you're overlooking the very simple point that most soldiers weren't addressed on which wars they'd like to fight (as if they'd say: ""all of them, let's get killing!"")

They were just told where to go and went. Those who joined up because they wanted to kill Afghans or whoever would be few and far between. You ask our troops why they're serving and I suspect the majority would say they joined to protect their way of life, whatever the reality of the job might have turned out to be.

Myself, I would argue that the reality of their jobs at the moment is fighting for the freedom of others. Whether or not you agree, you certainly can't mean to argue that their time overseas is spent primarily for their benefit. Yet it is these serving men and women, whose lives at home would scarcely be affected if Saddam continued to murder his people, or Ratko Mladić to shell Sarajevo, who you think are least deserving of remembrance?

It is the ultimate mission of combat forces too. Death is one of the worst ways to deal with things, we as a country have accepted this, that's why we don't have a death penalty anymore. However when people are being oppressed, or others are threatening/deny life to innocent people then sometimes military intervention is the only way to deal with it.

Instead Britain stopped trade with the Republicans while turning a blind eye to fascist Germany and Italy trading with Franco and even sending military aid in the form of actual soldiers aswell as equipment. There were many atrocities on both sides but a LOT more by Franco's side but the whole war is overlooked because of WW1 before it and WW2 which broke out soon afterwards.

Why on earth are you crossing the road, without looking, and definitely not on a pedestrian crossing, apparently purposefully avoiding those as if they were the devil's toys? Why haven't you checked if there wasn't a cyclist coming on the same road? Because you didn't hear any car coming?

I'm not using the pavement because I know I'm not allowed to, and because it would be dangerous for you pedestrians. Why the hell are you making me swerve on the cycle lane? Why are you using the road (sometimes, despite the car traffic!)?

In my experience, pedestrians are the worst ""road users"". I'm more scared of pedestrians' behaviour than I'm of the car driver's right behind me.

And yes, if I get hit by a car because a pedestrian suddenly decided there wasn't enough space on the pavement, and stepped off of it, using the cycle lane, and making me swerve, I'm blaming the pedestrian, not the car driver, who couldn't really have done anything about it.",0,1352670459,null,0,false,0,c6zug0h,t3_1309d2,t1_c6zug0h,t1_c6zocw7,null,1430379604,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

You're suggesting the govt should have scolded the press for misleading the public? Good luck with that.

&gt;That the govt was right all along?

Please pay attention. The harshest criticism of Blair's Iraq policy was that it was wrong - ill-considered, inept in execution and counter-productive in its results. Wrong.

But the Gilligan lie (and let's not forget that the man himself acknowledged the lie - to FAC &amp; Hutton) deflected attention into a fantasy world of dastardly conspiracy and ddeceit. Unfortunately for that story, five intensive inquiries have failed to find a morsel of evidence to support the fantasy - because none exists. None *could* exist - because the world simply doesn't work that way. Hundreds - maybe thousands of people would need to be in on this conspricay - many of them with exceptional reputations for strength of personality. Many of them with no reason to love Tony Blair.

In 2002, Blair's govt, the intelligence establishemnt (and most of the worlds intel bodies) and moost of the public - believed that Saddam must have WMD, and would be prpared to use them to promote regional hegemony (as he had done before).

The only delusion here was self-delusion - a widesspread groupthink - with its roots in Saddam's (undisputed) history and encouraged by Saddam himself. That we now know that Saddam was keeping his powder dry, while sanctions and inspections wer in force, has no bearing on what was believed - what was *known* in 2002.

There  is no excuse for this constant perpetuating of this shoddy journalist's lie. This decision has ben laid out in the most intensive/extensive detail ever seen in British history. To allow this mountain of evidence to be filtered into the soundbites beloved of the very media that got it all worng, the first time, is shameful.

Helmets don't save you from trucks. And to say they do is dangerous.

Example 3 - person uses headphones, gets hit by a bus. 

Here's the thing, in built up traffic, or even avarage commuting traffic you can't hear anything that specific. Traffic just becomes white noise. And even is said person could hear a bus, do we really think a cyclist could do much about it?

If you want to save lives....tell cyclists to Not cycle up the left hand side of vehicles, large vhicles especially. I believe being crushed my left turning trucks and busses represents something like 35% of all cycling deaths. That bit of info would and should be the first recommendation to all cyclists.

true,JamesM_,eng-durham,Durham,"&gt; It matters not (I'm my opinion) who hears the better on the road. In situations where a warning noise is made both cyclists and drivers could easily be in equal danger. So I would say that it's not a case of one party being more vulnerable than the other..

That utterly depends. ""A warning noise"" for a car may be a police siren (about to be T-boned by a copper shooting a red light), or an HGV horn (about to be pulverised).

A ""warning noise"" for a bike may be ""any engine"". Bikes are going to come off worse (and injure the rider) in a collision with just about anything, which makes them different from cars.

&gt; I addition too this, it does wind me up no end that one of the many criticisms of cyclists by drivers is a criticism they can equally be guilty of themselves.

While true in general (and true for many people, not just cyclists/drivers), in this case I see it more about the risk/danger tradeoff than anything else. Drivers can afford to be less aware of their surroundings (when it may cause them to come a cropper), because they are surrounded by a lovely metal box. (Note, I'm only talking about collisions where the first party comes off worse. Not car-on-bike collisions).

&gt; Another perspective...surly the person in charge of the machine that could kill someone with ease should take more precautions to when using their machine? Why blame cyclists.

Drivers *already* take care; drivers taking care is something that is universally true, beyond contesting and beyond the scope of this discussion :)

The point is, I as a driver treat other drivers as stupid. That's how I was taught to drive, and it's the way to avoid accidents.

The fact is that the Mail has a circulation of 1.95million per month, whilst the Guardian has just under 216,000 (2012).

true,MMSTINGRAY,eng-derbyshire,Derbyshire,"I havn't got my books to hand but I think there is several quotes in the Nuremberg Diaries and other first hand accounts of what Hitler said/did that show that attitude towards Britain. 

I haven't actually read the trilogy but if you have it to hand I'd prefer if you can cite whatever sources he used? I just don't remember ever reading about a serious plan to rule the world, maybe a few allusions to a world ruled by the Reich in rhetoric but that is not the same as actual intentions. 

As you pointed out Britain was a naval power which is of course a big reason why Hitler wanted to avoid hostilities with the British Empire, I never said otherwise, I simply said that he thought British people were superior to other races (I didn't think I'd have to say this but I obviously don't think that) and that he was planning to leave us alone as long as we didn't interfere with his continental plans. Hitler actually had little interest in conquest outside of Europe. Also a strong opposing force is more of a high priority target than a weak one, so what do you mean?

I can't find the link but there is some copies of (translated and untranslated) nazi literature available online, if you read that you will see it is primarily focused on reversing the 'injustice' of the treaty of Versailles, forming a great Germany, racial purity, etc within Europe. I think originally the party wanted colonies but Hitler actually didn't see the need and saw them as more of a problem than a benefit.

The Nazis invaded those countries for various reasons which are much to numerous to go into here unless you insist we break it down to that level lol. However Hitler and the Nazi party weren't stupid, it's never good to invade a country for no reason and all the places they invaded were strategically important for achieving their goal. 

Switzerland was left alone because they collaborated and there was no point in attacking them. Switzerland is a weak country and would have been crushed by the Nazi war machine, proof they didn't just invade wherever was easy.

Of course a nation of pacifists would be technically easier to invade, I'm not arguing against that. I'm arguing about the statement I made ""Hitler was planning on leaving Britain alone if we left Europe to him, I think he even actually said he wanted the British ruling overseas as he respected them more than the other ""races""."" That you said was false. 

By the way I'm not trying to be aggressive by asking for sources, I'm a historian so it's just par for the course. I know it can come across as something other than genuine interest in discussing it so thought I'd clarify :) I'd be citing sources myself if I was at my desktop and/or had all my books to hand. 

Also I'm not sure why either of us are being downvoted lol.

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"&gt;That utterly depends. ""A warning noise"" for a car may be a police siren (about to be T-boned by a copper shooting a red light), or an HGV horn (about to be pulverised).
A ""warning noise"" for a bike may be ""any engine"". Bikes are going to come off worse (and injure the rider) in a collision with just about anything, which makes them different from cars.

I think your making an incorrect assumption - the warning noises for both bikes and cars are the same, as both cars and cycles use the road, and they have to react to the same things. No argument that cyclist are more vulnerable in a slow traffic system than cars are, but, cars themselves are just as much a danger to other cars.

Most of the noise I hear on my bike is traffic from the rear as it overtakes. There would be nothing I could do if one of those cars had a moment and ran me down.

But..yes, there have been times where a siren is going off and I need to be aware of it, but even with headphones on, I suspect I would be as aware of it as any car drver with music on and we would both act in the correct manor.

Im rambling a little  - I suppose to sum up, if a cyclist can hear as much as a car driver, and we all have to react to the same things I really see no issue in this case.


&gt;Drivers can afford to be less aware of their surroundings (when it may cause them to come a cropper), because they are surrounded by a lovely metal box. (Note, I'm only talking about collisions where the first party comes off worse. Not car-on-bike collisions).

While its true that they are surrounded by a lovely metal box, its also true that they can (and do) exceed speeds of 80mph which I would argue puts both cars and cyclists on a more level playing field than most drivers assume.

&gt;Drivers already take care

True...and false.

Drivers (on the whole) have the best intentions, but that's not to say they are infallible, or even on the ball all the time. And cyclists are something of a blind spot (mentally and visually) for a lot of drivers. As a vulnerable road user I am pretty much at the mercy of other car drivers. If one accidentally miss judges something and plows into me, my headphones mean nothing, and there's almost nothing I could do to avoid it. In a round about way I agree with your idiot drivers comment.

&gt;take precautions (such as not having earbuds in, obeying the traffic laws, using a helmet) unless they want to take the risk.

On the face of it those are all good points. But (there's always a but). do you wear a helmet when driving, do you listen to music while driving? Adding one and removing the other would make you safer in your car.

There is one interesting thing to think about regarding precautions in a car verses a bike: A car offers nothing towards your health, you could easily argue that a car damages your health (due to inactivaty). A cyclist on the other hand, is (all things being equal) fitter, will have a longer life expectancy, and according to a bunch of papers (http://cyclehelmets.org/1015.html) the benefits out way the dangers by 20/1.

So im already taking a positive precautions with my life by cycling and not driving in the first place ;)


On a personal note - putting aside personal ""Logic"" regarding cycling....on my daily commute - Im high-viz'd up, have 6 lights on my bike, 4 of which a rear lights flashing night and day. I never jump lights, I never undertake, i maintain a average speed of around 23mph (about the same speed as city traffic round here) and I wear a helmet.  I like precautions. I just wish other cyclists where the same :)",0,1352679955,null,0,1352681491,0,c6zwydb,t3_1309d2,t1_c6zwydb,t1_c6zw1t6,null,1430380772,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2
true,Toneh,null,null,"&gt;I can however picture several ways that a cyclists head impacts part of the car or pavement.

Yeah, your right. I was just being difficult, and I wanted to open up a discussion about how helmets influence the rider and other road users. 

The questions remain, do cyclist with helmets get hit more often? Does that outweigh the higher risks of brain damage in the event of a collision?

I've noticed on the road that drivers are much more cautious around non-helmeted cyclists. I even spoke to a girl who confessed that she hated cyclists but was more cautious around the ones without helmets, to the point where she was afraid of overtaking, so my reverse psychology did work at least once. However, I've wondered if a flashing light attached to the helmet would confuse said drivers into being safe either way. 

There's a thrill about being more dangerous too. It sharpens the senses and gives you huge amounts of energy. My quads got huge from the high acceleration cycling in the city environment; you end up trying to accelerate with the flow of traffic rather than under or over take, it's like a right of passage on the road, prove you're willing to put a huge burst of power down and drivers respect your space. Vigorous movement of arms and legs, even a little wheel wobble also helps, keeping the motorized zombies on their toes. Drafting is the shit too, well over 35mph behind buses without breaking a sweat. 

PS I'd like to add a disclaimer for all of this: most of my opinions on this topic are conjectures. For safety advice; do whatever you can, whenever you can, to make sure you don't fucking hit anything. The road is the most dangerous thing you deal with on a day to day basis! Don't let tedium and normality ever make you forget that.

They wouldn't have taken over all of Russia, maybe as far in as Moscow but yeah I see your point. 

What was unacceptable was Britain being seen to break a protection treaty and for our business interests to be damaged. As I said, if we cared about what was right we would have got involved in the Spanish Civil War. Politicians at the time actually thought fascism would be a good way to slow down the 'commie tide' flooding from Russia. As you probably know Mussolini, Hitler and Franco all brutally put down and left wing groups in their country. If we cared about doing what was right we would have stopped Hitler straight away. Don't kid yourself into thinking that the British or American involvement was motivated by noble causes. And remember most of the Nazi stuff we think of as being so evil now wasn't actually known about at the time. 

The troops themselves probably were acting with noble intentions 9/10 times but the governments were. That's why I do feel a universal remembrance tradition is a good thing and that problems with atrocities and justifications should be laid at the feet of individual soldiers and the governments responsible, it shouldn't tarnish the collective memory of all those who died, in any war, doing what they felt was right and without any maliciousness.

I still love Tennant the most, but in a show that's run this long, and had so many actors, the only thing constant is change. (Oh and Daleks. We'll never see the last of them.)

Remember, Tom Baker used to be considered the absolute best Doctor. David was always going to leave at some point, the show was always going to continue on without him.

I might suggest showing her a couple good episodes from the classic series. Genesis of the Daleks I always found entertaining. Just tell her she'll get to see their origin, the origin of Davros, Sarah Jane in her prime, and a good Doctor who isn't David.

true,CannibalHolocaust,uk,London,"&gt;The troops themselves probably were acting with noble intentions 9/10 times but the governments were. That's why I do feel a universal remembrance tradition is a good thing and that problems with atrocities and justifications should be laid at the feet of individual soldiers and the governments responsible, it shouldn't tarnish the collective memory of all those who died, in any war, doing what they felt was right and without any maliciousness.

The thing is, everyone thinks they're in the right. I strongly doubt there's an army who believe they're the 'bad guys' and the enemy are the 'good guys'. The Taliban now don't think they're bad nor did the Red Army, the troops in the British colonies, German troops in WWI/WWII etc. I think this universal praise of troops is dangerous because it promotes the notion that simply being in the army and following orders regardless of their merit is something which is honourable. I disagree entirely with that position and think instead people should be praised based on merit. I have no problem praising troops who died fighting the Nazis in WWII but I do have a problem praising troops who took part in the genocide against the Kikuyu people or facilitating the famine against Bengalis.

It's not necessarily aggressive to ask for sources it is however rather hypocritical to do so whilst seeking to excuse yourself of any requirement to do so.

&gt;I can't find the link but there is some copies of (translated and untranslated) nazi literature available online, if you read that you will see it is primarily focused on reversing the 'injustice' of the treaty of Versailles, forming a great Germany, racial purity, etc within Europe. I think originally the party wanted colonies but Hitler actually didn't see the need and saw them as more of a problem than a benefit.

Whilst I make no claims to being a historian I did do (modern) history at Uni and so have read a fair few sources on the Nazis. Amonst other things I must take issue with your usage of 'within Europe' as it is evident going simply off his military actions that  Hitler wanted the 3rd Reich to expand far beyond the European peninsular. Even within the short time he had he attempted to push into the main body of Eurasia, Arabia and Northern Africa.

I would agree however that Hitler didn't really want colonies, what he had in mind was more like an Aryan Dominion ultimately covering the entire globe.

&gt;Switzerland was left alone because they collaborated and there was no point in attacking them. Switzerland is a weak country and would have been crushed by the Nazi war machine, proof they didn't just invade wherever was easy.

Take a look at the extravagant preparations to Swiss have long made to defend themselves, they're 'weak' only in the sense that they've got minimal ability to project military force. Defensively (helped in no small part by geography) they're strong and would have taken a great deal of Nazi blood and treasure to conquer. In stark contrast to a pacifist Britain which the Nazis would have been a prime target for the Nazis if only for our industrial base and massive merchant marine.

edit. I don't have the 3rd Reich Trilogy to hand just now but am reminded of a quote from a book I do have to hand. Whilst I disagree with him on a good deal Hobsbawm is bang on in The Age of Extremes: Part One - The Age of Catastrophe - CHpt 5 Against the Common Enemy p.54:

&gt;""Yet compromise and negotiation with Hitler’s Germany were impossible, because the policy objectives of National Socialism were irrational and unlimited. Expansion and aggression were built into the system and, short of accepting Nazi domination in advance, i.e. choosing not to resist the Nazi advance, war was unavoidable, sooner rather than later.""",0,1352682042,null,0,1352683669,0,c6zxhwu,t3_130a3g,t1_c6zxhwu,t1_c6zwsgg,null,1430381027,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

I really do see where you are coming from with this but I think that there is a difference, which should be recognised, between praising those who have done wrong and having general remembrance services for the armed forces as a whole.

true,Deynai,null,null,"&gt;I've been told that STEP papers are not rigorous and that I should not bother preparing for them as I am doing four maths A-Levels

In my opinion this is really terrible advice. 

There's multiple reasons for spending almost all of your time preparing for STEP to be honest. There is overlap in STEP, so by doing STEP questions you'll also be revising for your A-level work and highlighting areas that you may not fully understand such that you get a much more grounded knowledge of the A level content than if you only did A-level questions. 

Also practice, the length of the questions demands stamina and accuracy, so if you're going to do well you'll need to be able to do a couple pages of maths for a single question without making silly algebra mistakes, something that I found A-level maths alone was not sufficient for. Having this practice will make A-level questions feel like a breeze. 

Furthermore, you could have 100% in every paper in as many A-levels as you like, if you don't get your 1,1 in STEP then you will not get in (They sometimes have leniency with the 1,1 requirement, but since you're doing 8 A-levels I get the feeling they would be very strict indeed about the 1,1). Alternatively, get your 1,1 in STEP, A* in Maths, A's in the Further maths + additional, and fails in everything else, and you will be fine.

Having said this, I should also add that this is advice I would have given myself 2 years ago as someone who was doing 3 A-levels and almost nothing mathematical outside of that. It's possible (likely) you're a lot better at Maths than I am and you might find STEP a doddle, but at the very least make sure you look at the past papers before you write off the need to prepare for them.

Why don't you read up on what fascism actually is before you start insulting people who would put their safety on the line to keep the streets safe from those like the EDL. I was in Norwich yesterday, and happily I can say that we chased the majority of these bastards into the train station they came from and away from our community. 

I can only assume you commented here to try to slander people that go out and actively campaign against organised racial hatred, so that it does not become accepted in our society. And for that you should be ashamed of yourself.

The majority of German forces were deployed in Europe, North Africa in support of Mussolini (remember Mussolini wanted to reforge the eastern Roman Empire and also occupy parts of Africa, something Hitler was happy to let him do if he could manage it) and on the Eastern Front. So Arabia and North Africa were more in support of Italian troops. I'll admit that the Eastern front was out of Europe but that was more because Hitler felt it was necessary to invade Russia as it would only be a matter of time until they attacked him. That was more, from Hitler's point of view, of military necessity rather than a advancement of Nazi ideology. He did say (I think in Mein Kampf) that if a united Reich did need to extend it's borders at some point it should be east towards Russia and that colonies were no good. In some of the meetings where he can be seen to be explicitly planning an aggressive war he talked about conquest being out of a need for more agricultural space rather than it being a matter of conquering peoples. 

He really wasn't planning on conquering the globe. I think there were other Nazis who did talk about such a thing but they were considered extreme ideologists even within the Nazi party.
Either way the main aim was to unite all Germanic peoples under one ruler, to achieve racial purity within those borders and to have enough land and wealth to feed, clothe and employ all the people while still leaving the country wealthy. I think there was also some stuff about equal rights and stature as the rest of Europe.

Mein Kampf and other nazi literature like that magazine I can't remember the name of that I think Rosenberg printed? It's full of stuff about how people of the same culture should all be under the same rule. There was even talk about exporting people to their homelands and stuff. It's all crazy of course but like most insane stuff their is a method to the madness lol.

I agree that a pacifist Britain would be easier to conquer, as I said, I'm arguing about what Hitler was planning which was NOT a conquest of the entire world.

And the Swiss could have been crushed easily, Belgium was long considered really defensible and fortified and look how long that lasted. Especially after they became completely land locked by the creation of Vichy France, even before that though Nazi forces could have easily occupied the main cities and the government would have to had to flee or surrender. How can you deny that? And if that isn't occupation then what is?

If you are on a computer or laptop or have any appropriate books to hand then please find something that shows Hitler was planning what you say. 

I am aware that I, rather embarrassingly, can't provide any of my own sources right now but if you ask other people who know a lot about WWII they will probably verify what I say, if you do your own research it will agree with what I say.

I think it's an entirely harmless gesture that only accomplishes good things, and news presenters/celebrities wearing poppies encourages others to buy/wear them, even if for the wrong reasons, which is ultimately a good thing due to the money charity receives.

true,nothanksohokay,null,null,"You need canvas, a bunch (at least three boxes) of 24 count crayola brand crayons (they melt the best), a glue gun, a heat gun (or hair dryer but it will take much longer), painter's tape, and an area outside.  For the tardis I used foam that I bought at walmart in a rainbow variety pack.  I printed out a basic photo, stenciled on the foam with pencil, and then used an x-acto knife to cut out two Tardis' (Tardi?).  One was attached to the canvas with double sided tape while I melted the crayons, and then the second went on after so it looks totally clean but the lines of the wax outline the image.  

Glue gun the crayons to the top of the canvas with the points facing down. Outline the canvas in painter's tape so that if the outer crayon splatters it only gets on the tape and your sides are still white.  Go outside (or in my case, my open garage) and use the heat gun to melt the crayons.  

It takes practice to get the wax to go in the direction you want, learning how far and close to keep your heat gun, and the angle the canvas sits at is very important too.  Different colors react differently.  This is the first complete one I did, I experimented a bunch with spare canvas and crayons to figure out how my heat gun worked and what angles and amount of time worked best.

true,Zenigata,null,null,"&gt;‘The aim of German foreign policy’, Hitler began, according to Hossbach’s memorandum of the meeting, ‘was to make secure and to preserve the racial stock (Volksmasse) and to enlarge it. It was therefore a question of space.’ By this he meant, as he had always done, the conquest of East-Central and Eastern Europe, which would solve the German race’s need for expansion ‘only for a foreseeable period of about one to three generations’ before further expansion, probably overseas, became necessary and indeed, with the probable collapse of the British Empire, possible. After a detailed survey of the shortages in raw materials and foodstuffs, Hitler concluded that ‘autarky, in regard both to food and to the economy as a whole, could not be maintained’. The solution especially in terms of food supplies was to be found in ‘gaining space for agricultural use’ in Europe, by conquest and, implicitly, the removal or reduction of the people who lived there. ‘Germany’s problem’, he declared, ‘could be solved only by the use of force.’93 - The Third Reich in Power p432

Why would Hitler's ambitions arbitrarily stop with a limited Eastern expansion? Endless expansion till all the lebensraum is occupied by Aryans is the logical end game of Nazi ideology.

true,pnw0,eu,United Kingdom,"Amazing how bad people passwords are.

Passwords like this ""torino2006"" are not secure. If you notice, some of these look like a random string of numbers and letters (eg 2a3a793266745d14eca0a9e4bd179f2a ) while some have that plus a password in brackets. This is because passwords aren't actually stored, what is known as a hash is stored. 

A hash is a string of numbers and letters that are generated from your password in a one way mathematical process (meaning that you can't get the password from the hash). The way they were able to get the passwords here was by generating (or buying) a massive [table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table) of hashes for lots of words in the dictionary, as well as words + numbers, then they could compare their table with stolen hashes of the password, if they see that two of them are the same, then they have their password.

To avoid this happening, you need to use a password that doesn't use words in the dictionary (or any common used phrases, such as abc). Using characters such as '@' instead of 'a' (eg t0m@t0e$) is **not** a good idea, because when they are generating their table they can very easily generate tables which take this in to account.",0,1352685975,null,0,false,0,c6zyjpt,t3_1317sc,t1_c6zyjpt,t3_1317sc,null,1435669530,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I agree with Sgt_General, Green would be better placed in the centre at the moment. He is the kind of grafting player that the midfield will need in the absence of Austin. I would also be slightly doubtful over Diouf starting the game considering his reaction to getting taken off, but if he does play I would expect him to play the support striker role.

Hopefully we can get Jerome in as soon as possible, our options up front are threadbare, and I think he would be good for us. If the takeover does indeed happen ""in days"" then I would imagine Warnock will move fast to strengthen, there are plenty of Premiership fringe players that could improve the squad, and I think there is probably a list somewhere  of all the players that Warnock would like to bring in.

But what you think is the logical end game is different to what Hitler said himself, what others reports said and what he actually made plans fore. And what I'm arguing is Hitler's plans not what may have happened, one deals with facts and is academic history the other doesn't and is just pure (but fun) speculation.

The control over the Suez control would have been useful during the war to combat British trade and limit their maneuverability, after the war it wouldn't have been as big of a deal for the Germany that Hitler envisaged. If a peace was made with Britain then it wouldn't really matter who held the Suez whether it was Italy, Germany or Britain. 

As for oil well Saudi Arabia wasn't really the best place to go for oil as it was not fully realised how rich in oil it was and the industry there wasn't yet as well developed as elsewhere, plus it would be harder to transport. Where as Germany controlled/would control (depending when in the war we are talking) most of Scandinavia, Romania and the Caucus area in Russia. These were all oil rich places that had non of the disadvantages. I can't remember the exact statistic but Romania alone provided something like a third of all the oil the Axis needed during the war.

true,Zenigata,null,null,"&gt;I concede I'm not sure how far East he would have pushed but endless expansion is not feasible nor would there be much need if he held roughly the area that was the maximum extent of the German advance.

""Much need"" till when? If the Nazis had got their 'Thousand Year Reich' would limited eastern expansion have been anything like enough? 

As the source which you demanded and I supplied stated the Nazis initial war aims were intended to provide for **‘only for a foreseeable period of about one to three generations’** after that further lebensraum would be necessary for the expanded Aryan population. It seems rather bad form for you to demand a source then not acknowledge it

As for this being ""not feasible"" we're talking about Hitler here, of course global conquest is ""not feasible"" that's hardly going to stop it being a mad man's end goal now is it? But going back to our initial point of contention invading a nation of pacifists who have great industrial capabilities &amp; a massive merchant marine would have been both highly feasible and desirable for a megalomaniac.

Why are you making out that Saudi Arabia is the only place in the area with oil? Iran was a major producer of oil in the 30s. Even with Romania oil, that is to say the lack of it, was a continual problem for the Nazis (hence all there messing about trying to make synthetic oil).

true,Deynai,null,null,"&gt;Is there any particular method to ensure accuracy and rigor or is it just a matter of repetition and logical layout?

It's something that just comes with practice really. With preparing for A-levels, I think a lot of people just try to memorise how methods work through repetition more than anything, and if you've done a good enough job of searing it into your mind then you'll get full marks. 

With STEP though it's a bit different, you're not just memorising more and more things, you're actually improving your ability as a mathematician, learning where to look for clues, increasing accuracy, stamina, etc. In a way it's still just repetition, but it's not repetition of a single method until you've memorised it, it's repetition of lots and lots of difficult problems with none of them quite the same.

&gt;when would you recommend that I start preparing for STEP.

It really depends. A very small minority of people take STEP a year early and have a first go at it in year 12, but I have heard if you do this then you can end up with a higher requirement on your offer (i.e S,1 instead of 1,1). In contrast, you can leave it as late as February/March of Year 13 before you start and still have sufficient time to prepare.  

There's certainly no harm in looking at the questions and having a go now if you're keen though. You're unlikely to run out of questions to do as there's an archive of about 25 years (75 papers, ~13 questions on each). The [booklet by Stephen Siklos](http://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/admissions/step/advpcm.pdf)  (My DoS!) is probably the best place to start, as it gives a nice introduction to what STEP is about and has a nice selection of questions with his own personal comments/hints and full solutions for each.",0,1352691001,null,0,false,0,c6zzzrj,t3_1310l7,t1_c6zzzrj,t1_c6zxrwd,null,1430382203,3,false,cambridge_uni,t5_2s17x,3

Most of what Hitler did wasn't that crazy (militarily not morally) up until part way through the war with Russia. He didn't plan to conquer the world.

I said repeatedly it would be easier to invade a nation of pacifists, I am arguing that Hitler didn't want to conquer the world. I've said that like 4 times now lol. And what does being a megalomaniac have to do with it? 

The lack of oil is why they wanted to seize the Caucus oil fields, also if Russia surrendered the end of the war, and easier trading, would be much closer. If Mussolini captured Iran then it wouldn't be part of the Aryan master race and would still provide Hitler with oil, plus the demand for oil would drop significantly after the war. In Hitler's mind he wasn't going to lose, and it was questionable if he would for a while.

I'm done with this subreddit, I'm going to find a Doctor Who community that:

1: Accepts that Rose is not the only companion 

2: Doesn't think that the ""love"" between a 900 year old being and an immature 18 year old girl is in any way meaningful and not deeply disturbing

3: Doesn't feel betrayed because the Doctor brought other companions to the same place(s) he brought Rose

4: Isn't psychopathic in their affection for a character, be it Rose, or 10. Seriously, it's pretty damn rare to see a post that talks positively about a Doctor other than 10 that isn't full of ""BUT 10 IS BETTER"", ""HE WAS OK BUT 10 IS THE BEST"", ""HE WAS AWFUL, 10 WAS THE BEST BECAUSE HE LOVED ROSE"", etc etc.

That's only a fan theory, and not really a great one, if you ask me. People love citing it around here, but it has no actual grounds in any form of Doctor Who. The truth is that regeneration is something Rassilon toyed with, and eventually changed the DNA of Time Lords to implement. Along with this, he wired into their bodies that they could only regenerate 12 times.

It also wouldn't make much sense if River Song could burn through all of her regenerations if the regeneration limit was just a Time Lord law.

&gt; why she had to kill him

As seen in ""A Good Man Goes to War,"" Melody Pond was abducted by Madame Kovarian to be used as a weapon to kill the Doctor- the goal the Silence were (and possibly still are) striving to achieve.

&gt; why 11 had to marry her

If you've seen the 10th Doctor episode, ""Silence in the Library,"" we catch a scene where River whispers something into the Doctor's ear when he asks why he should trust her- we know now that she said they were married in the future (remember that River's timeline runs opposite to the Doctor's, so the first time the Doctor sees River is the last time River sees the Doctor, and so on).

&gt; why she is even part of his story

River was first introduced as a character in the two-parter, ""Silence in the Library"" and ""Forest of the Dead."" We know that since the Doctor and River's timelines run opposite to each other, then this two-parter was the *last* time the Doctor met River, though it's the *first* time he met her, leaving her story open-ended. It also helps that Moffat wrote those two episodes- he probably had something bigger for River in mind even at that point.

&gt; Her storyline, and Amy's for that matter, got a bit confusing.

So, I've pretty much explained the big details on River, so we'll get to Amy. The general belief is that River was conceived on Amy and Rory's wedding night. Sometime between their honeymoon and ""The Impossible Astronaut,"" Madame Kovarian kidnaps Amy and replaces her with a Ganger.

So i'll admit, Dempsey has certainly been less than impressive, but that's mostly in relation to everyone else.

The thing to remember about Dempsey is this; he is the only one of our summer signings who is having to learn an entirely new style of play, and, in effect, a new position.

Dembele is being asked to do exactly what he did at Fulham; pick the ball up deep, advance it on the dribble, create, and make incisive runs. Pretty straightforward.

Gylfi is playing the same style of game he played at Swansea; pass and move; in generally the same position.

Jan is playing exactly the same position and style that he did at Ajax, which is why he's fit in so well; he's playing the same game with different people around him.

That also generally applies to Hugo; he's being asked to keep doing what he was always doing.

But Dempsey, at Fulham, was played either on the wing, but allowed to float inside, or behind the main striker, but was always tasked with simply cleaning up the attacking chances. He was not a creative influence; he's a finisher, a janitor of sorts, cleaning up the chances everyone else makes. And he's very good at that, as we've seen here; despite not creating very many chances, he's popped up and scored 2 goals in 4 games, a decent strike rate for someone who's not a striker. The guy scored 17 goals last year for Fulham. He's not a talentless hack anymore than Defoe is; they're both just specialized players who play and thrive a certain way.

But here, he's also being tasked with linking up play in the final third, something he's simply not great at. He sees space well, and runs to it, but needs someone to get him the ball. He hasn't had much game time with Dembele, but when he has he's looked far better. The other thing to remember here is that Defoe, who's been on form as our striker, is also a poacher; a great many of the goals that Dempsey would ordinarily get a chance at are being cleaned up by Defoe instead.

What Dempsey needs is a little more time to learn the system and his position in it, and also, Adebayor. Adebayor's ability to create chances for other players will be a huge boon for Dempsey; I think that he will feast off Adebayor's hold-up play in the final third.

TL,DR; Dempsey is our only summer signing in a new position, wait til Adebayor starts playing regularly.

TL,DR edit; And Dembele gets back so we can actually move the ball up the field reliably.",0,1352698367,null,0,false,0,c701yhb,t3_131kdv,t1_c701yhb,t3_131kdv,null,1430383201,30,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,30

Bale and Lennon's productivity being poor today was much more because of our midfield and link play than their actual performance. I love THudd, but pairing him with Sandro is not a good strategy. Sandro is a ball winning midfield, and he's a beast at it. However, THudd cannot pass under pressure. If he has space, he plays long balls better than anyone, but he cannot dribble and move the ball around when being pressed, which teams like Man City at home are obviously going to do. The THudd to Caulker set piece goal was a thing of beauty, but it was completely obvious to me from the start today that we were not going to score from open play. We desperately need Dembele back.

People are always going to question manager's decisions. I don't know how football would be like if every fan simply ""[trusted] the manager and his decisions."" Gone will be the blogs analyzing the lineups and formations pre-match.

I also enjoyed the characters, for the most part, the ELO bit was fun, and the plot in and of itself isn't too bad. It's two things that really make me dislike it.

1. Do you have a concept in sci fi or horror that really squicks you out? I can sit through a panoply of horror movies with some mixture of blase, amused, and excited. But there are a couple of concepts that just send me right for the Never Drawer, wherein I shall file what my mind beheld. Chucky the doll in Child's Play is one. What the Absorbaloff does to people is another. I can't exactly tell you why, it's just one of those things.

2. The way the ending is handled is intensely unrealistic in a way that calls back to and sort of highlights what were minor missteps earlier in the episode. After we managed to swallow down the ""Absorbaloff"" nonsense and take it in good cheer, the painfully obvious ""plot twist"" with an attitude of ""oh it's just a silly one-off episode I shouldn't take it too seriously"", and then we hit the end... Here we've got a fate worse than death handled with total writer's ineptitude. Yes, I know she says ""it's really quite peaceful"" but you know what? Bull. A human born and raised consciousness wouldn't feel just dandy about eternity as a stone slab. The Doctor would have known better too, that he brings someone back who had passed on and trapped their mind in a paving slab was just plain cruel. It flies in the face of the Doctor's established character. The idea he would lock someone in that state forever because ""it's better than dead"" is very...un-Doctor-like. The ""love life"" bit, cheap gag though it may be, at this point only serves to heighten the revulsion at this terrible plot point. The ending took what had otherwise been a silly, throwaway, but still *fun* episode and turned it into stomach-churning in the last few minutes.

&gt;And heavily regulated part privatized, or social insurance healthcare works very well in Europe. Germany and Holland have private insurers, France has private hospitals, all have copayments, and they are rated better or equal to the NHS. Britain has one of the most socialist systems in the world. Personally, I think our system works pretty well, and I'm reluctant to change it, but all of this rhetoric that the Tories are switching to an American system is incorrect.

Actually its a fair analogy. There isn't going to be socialized healthcare in the UK, the bill introduced this year removes the requirement for universal healthcare and people are already being turned away from major operations that aren't deemed essential. The European countries at least provide a basic level of care for all operations, this won't be the case in the UK. Instead of a hip operation you will get walking aids since they are cheaper. Private health insurers often don't cover chronic conditions so people will be forced back onto the nhs. Frankly what has been voted in is a mess. Still the Tory and liberal mps were so happy they banged that table the day after he bill was improved. Was this because they stand to personally gain through this bill, hundreds of them have directorships and hold shares in these private health companies?

Let's compare Cambridge's Maths admissions statistics with other subjects. The vast majority of applicants get an interview, and then:

- In other subjects, on average less than a quarter of applicants get an offer. Then about **85% of these will get in**.

- In Maths, over a third of applicants get an offer. Then about **50% of these get in** (including a small number who miss their offer but get in anyway).

The difference, of course, is down to the fact that it's a lot easier to get A*AA than to pass STEP.

STEP is much harder than A-level mathematics. Each question is much longer than an A-level question (you're supposed to answer between 4 and 6 of them in 3 hours!), and they're designed to stretch you much further than you're used to. You don't need to learn any material beyond the A-level syllabus to take STEP. However, you need a great deal more mathematical maturity, ability and experience dealing with more difficult and complex problems.

From your other post:

&gt;My Maths teacher has told me that STEP papers are not as difficult as A2 Further Maths, this doesn't sound right to me. Is it the case?

I think your teacher needs sacking and you need someone competent to give you advice.

You don't need to start preparing for STEP straight away, but it would certainly be more useful than taking 4 superfluous AS levels. (By the way, unless you've got a very good reason I'd recommend dropping at least a couple of these. If your reason is ""I want to get into Cambridge"", then not only is that not a good reason, it's postively counterproductive.)

I'll leave you with a couple of good resources to start with:

true,Swiftfooted,eng-northumberland,Geordie in London,"The police will have arrested him under s. 127 of the Communications Act 2003 (now the most misused statute in history) which prohibits sending grossly offensive or menacing messages over public electronic communications networks. 

Considering there have been a few cases recently as frivolous as this where the CPS have simply chosen not to prosecute, I can't see him actually being charged. Of course the worrying thing is that the police are still arresting people in these circumstances and obviously have no clue what the law actually is. Even a few recent cases which have gone to magistrates courts and ended up in fairly disproportionate sentences are probably based on a misreading of the law, hence why you're right in being disappointed that anyone is pleading guilty to these offences.

It may just be the law student in me talking, but I really want a case on this section to go up to the Supreme Court. Assuming they can have a rare moment of clarity it would probably stop the ridiculous arrests we're seeing now. Failing that we're now far beyond the requirement of any restrictions on free speech being necessary in a democratic society (under the ECHR) so I'd be interested in the European Court of Human Rights' opinion on the section. Unfortunately if the case is simply thrown out by a magistrate or not prosecuted there's absolutely no precedent, it needs to go to at least the High Court. 

Of course a final option could be a massive movement of everyone just posting the most blatantly offensive and menacing messages they could think of to try and create some political will to amend the section.

true,acuteindifference,1905,Super Frank,"&gt;at the current moment the only problem with the team is our inability to bury the game early.

I disagree. In games like Shakhtar, for example, they pressed hard and stopped the ball getting to our attacking trio, or made sure whenever they had the ball, they didn't have any space. One of Mata, Hazard or Oscar continuously had to drop back to get the ball and start an attack. I still think there is no transition between our defense and attack, and stronger teams have been (and will be) easily able to trouble us. For the type of game we're trying to play, most (if not all) of our players have to be comfortable on the ball and able to pass it. Our position at the top of the table had most people wrongly convinced that we've been excellent this season. We haven't been. 

We need a deep player who is comfortable on the ball and who can pass the ball (long and short). Mikel and Ramires both have the same weakness; their passing is terrible and we saw that again today.

Is looks like the Libyans started an Arab Spring type of civilian protest but it somehow escalated into an armed conflict which emanated from factions in Benghazi who fancied seizing power for themselves. The Western powers jumped on board and decided to support the rebels because they have a beef about Ghaddafi. 

Ultimately, the rich nations interference in the conflict resulted in a stable country being torn to pieces and left in a state of chaos, run by warlords. Surely a great improvement. 

In Syria it looks like a similar narrative. If you try to learn something about the situation, there are credible sources suggesting that the rebel forces are not acting alone and that the West again is shit stirring in order to destabilise Iran, upset Hizbullah, fuck with Assad, suck Israeli cocks, institute a shock-doctrine and impose an IMF-World Bank fiscal dictatorship etc. etc. 

Actually, I don't really know. We are in the dark. But ""pretty much the same as Libya"" doesn't indicate much. 


&gt;Whereas in Afghanistan we're there to try and install a western democracy


In Afghanistan, if by ""we"" you are referring to the Western powers, they are there to revenge 9/11, and to control part of the world where they want to put an oil pipeline. They also like being next door to Iran. 

Now they're in a situation from which they don't know how to extract themselves.

I could apply much of what he said to my own company. I was discussing this point with a colleague this morning. However, I think there are some factors that make this different. 

a) I think it's quite remarkable that the employees of the BBC can openly criticize their employer on air in a way that they might discuss any other organisation.

b) I don't think the criticizm was valueless bitching like many disgruntled employees. There was some positive feedback with a view to keeping the BBC an effective public service.

Anyone could have knocked in 3 goals given the service he had that game, every single one of his goals was a one touch thing. That service just isn't going to happen against city.

Defoe doesn't offer much to the team short of poaching, prior to the Maribor game he had 1 goal from 8 matches. He was yanked last weekend because he had a measly 11 touches in 60 mins (as the lone striker!), so his form has been dropping. Against city we just aren't going to have the opportunities for Defoe to 'poach a goal', instead we needed someone who could bring Bale/Dempsey/Lennon into the game to provide us with a more rounded attack, Ade is that man.

Ade was man of the match as voted here, with more than double the votes of his nearest rival (Sandro), I feel that your opinion that he did fuck all is off. Dempsey/Lennon/Bale were certainly off on Sunday which doesn't help Ade (and would have completely nullified Defoe).

AVB also alluded to the fact that rest time between games influenced his striker decision. Defoe almost hasn't rested in months (playing 2 near full games in the past 7 days, 3 if he played on Sunday), Ade has fresh legs.

My gripe about this story is twofold; firstly is that the BBC is so ratings orientated that they want to go out and actually create news (and report on themselves) so even safe zones like R4 now try and create controversy and then make it last for a news cycle. In this case they weren't content with the Saville story, but wanted a trend so they picked up a story from 20 years ago and tried to revive it.

The massive concern for me is that Rochdale has teenagers that need help now, and importantly has police officers and socials workers who are in their jobs now that actively caused them further harm. It is a massive scandal dwarfing this one and yet, the BBC wanted to move to another story about a  dead abuser and that suited a lot of people. They then decided to drop that one and start another one.

The major problem with the current system isn't so much that there are loopholes, the problem is that only a small percentage of tax payers use them. If everyone used them then taxes could be raised to account for the loss and everything would be fair, the same applies in reverse if the loopholes were removed, taxes could be lowered and they would still be fair.

The situation we as tax payers find ourselves in at this time are patently unfair. Now, the media browbeating and putting social pressure on tax payers who are mitigating their tax exposure wil be effective up to a point, as people don't like to have their reputation tarnished, but that won't actually fix things in the long term.

The only thing that can fix the system in the long term is tax reform and a closing of the loopholes, the only way to force that kind of thing through is to ensure the government is under more pressure to reform than not to.
Unfortunately due to the media and corporate influence on our political system the only way to force through such change is to hurt the government more than the smearing they will receive from the large companies opposed to it.

The only way I can think of making that come about is a society wide effort to take advantage of the system in the same way that the opponents of tax reform do, hence my above assertion that everyone should mitigate their tax exposure as much as is legally possible.

You suggest that the UN should intervene in Syria, the UN have already intervened in Syria, keep in mind the UN Troop have strict doctrines against aggressive intervention meaning the majority of the time they act as an independent observer. They both lack the equipment and troop for a more aggressive intervention hence such action fall across multilateral groups such as NATO, EU and in the case of Africa AU. 

As mentioned already part of the problem with why it is the responsibility of Britain lies in the fact that our military is one of the most powerful within NATO and as such there is a pressure for right or wrong for Britain to act.

Vehicles that kill people quite often as shown by a quick search, yet finding more than a few injuries a year related to cyclists jumping reds is quite a task.

You're much more likely to be hit by a car jumping a red light, you are also more likely to die from that collision too.  While I wouldn't like to be hit be either, I know which one I'd rather be hit by, even though statistically I'm more likely to be hit by the bigger one.

So good job doing your research there.

Another internet search shows that Breivik claims he cannot be allied with the English Defence League because they support multiculturalism. 

&gt; And in what way are UAF not still anti-racist? That's the whole point of their existence. And I am a proud anti-fascist, I recognise the danger of far-right extremism (particularly at the moment) and I want to help stamp it out before it gains any support.

The UAF contain dangerous far left elements the same way in which the EDL contains dangerous far right elements.

&gt; As if you're getting confused between anti-fascism and fascism itself. You haven't got a clue! Why don't you read up on what fascism actually is before you start insulting people who would put their safety on the line to keep the streets safe from those like the EDL. I was in Norwich yesterday, and happily I can say that we chased the majority of these bastards into the train station they came from and away from our community.

You couldn't make it up. Do some research in how the fascists of post-WW1 Germany seized power. They did so by beating up their opponents on the street. That sounds a lot like the actions you are utilising.

You cannot claim you are anti fascist and then proceed to talk about how you attack people that have different views to you. Why is this so difficult for you to comprehend?

The English Defence League are expressing their right to free speech and to peacefully protest. You have the right to counter protest these demonstrations. You do not have the right to threaten people with physical violence to prevent them from expressing themselves. This applies to both people on the left and people on the right.

&gt; I can only assume you commented here to try to slander people that go out and actively campaign against organised racial hatred

I've already said I support peaceful protest. I don't support non-peaceful protest which the UAF is just as happy to drum up themselves.

I do not particularly like the EDL or the UAF. I think a five minute conversation with members of either group shows them for what they are.

&gt; Take a good hard look at Greece at the moment, and tell me that UAF are the same as fascists

Are the EDL the same as Golden Dawn?

In the US, you have a mess. You can't use your phone on any carrier you wish like you can here. Each carrier has  their own exclusive phone.

Furthermore, carriers like Verizon clamp down on the device so you never truly own it. They withhold software upgrades so it takes additional months for the next version of Android (for example) to reach your phone.

This is a joke right? Islamic extremism is not a problem in the UK?

* Richard Reid planned to blow up a commercial aircraft in-flight. He was born and raised in England. It is especially concerning when it's revealed he was radicalised at the Finsbury Park Mosque which was taken over by a group of Islamists. Complete failure of Multiculturalism where a whole community of recently arrived Algerians and other Muslims who had been born here came together declaring war against the West.

* Taimour Abdulwahab al-Abdaly, otherwise known as the Stockholm bomber, showed little interest in religion whilst growing up in Sweden. Yet after attending the University of Luton, and further residing in Luton for 10 years, he became radicalised. The family of this man blame British society for the radicalisation of their son.

* Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian Islamist that tried to detonate explosives during a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit, was president of UCL's Islamic Society. During one of the society's trips, a preacher told members “Dying while fighting jihad is one of the surest ways to paradise"". He is the Fourth president of a London student Islamic society to face terrorist charges in three years.

* Bilal Abdullah is a man born and raised in the UK who was behind the 2007 Glasgow International Airport attack and also alleged to be behind the 2007 London car bombs plot.

* The London Stock Exchange bomb plot? All nine of them were British Citizens.

* The failed 2008 Exeter bombings? Nicky Raymond Reilly ( Mohamed Abdulaziz Rashid Saeed-Alim) born in England, radicalised by religious fundamentalists.


That's just a few examples of how Islamic extremism threatens the UK.

I didn't even realise that there was a central head of the ULU, I thought there were student heads of UCL, Goldsmiths, LSE, QMary etc. Unions. 

While I am not sure that I would have declined to attend a remembrance service, I do think that he does raise a point that the 'non-political' nature of remembrance services can limit our ability to think critically about diplomacy, morality and conflict at present. Even wearing a poppy could be interpreted as a rather nationalist badge, as remembering the soldiers who fought and died in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Falklands is not entirely dissimilar to tacit support for these wars. I am sure that the British public would be outraged for example, to see German footballers wearing a mark of remembrance for German/Italian/Japanese soldiers who died in 20C conflicts *even if this not about the wars themselves, simply the deaths of the soldiers*. 

So the poppy is perhaps a more politically charged statement than we realise.  

Clearly, remembrance should not at all be a time to say: 'look how many people died because of the Tory party's foreign policy, Labour would be much better / No this is all Labour's fault, their peace plan was shite...' However, if there is an unwillingness to look at our foreign policy and global events objectively in retrospect then we will almost inevitably be doomed to repeat our mistakes again and again. As one comment suggests, it can seem a little odd for David Cameron to be lamenting loss of life in previous wars, while sending British soldiers over the top in Afghanistan, lobbying for several regimes with highly dubious human rights records to buy British arms and maintaining a nuclear arsenal able to kill millions. I am certainly not saying that these actions are incompatible, simply that they might warrant scrutiny.

Wow, that is quite impressive.  The attempt to claim VAT (paid by the customer) as a tax paid by Starbucks is pretty outrageous.  Nice of them to pay NI contributions and rates though.  They don't get that the issue is not that they're evading, it's that they're avoiding via pretty devious creative accounting techniques.

The Government &amp; EU should of course look at these loopholes (it should be noted that Starbucks in France and Germany pay minimal tax due to the same reasons as well, so it's not a UK-specific issue), but Starbucks really need to think about the impact on their brand.

All intervention needs to first be backed with a credible alternative on the ground in the nation in question. This was the problem in Afghanistan and Iraq. No credible alternative to the Taleban and Baath party.

Secondly it needs wide ranging support. In Libya we had the support of the Arab League, UN and NATO in general (ironically needing to drag the Americans into it kicking and screaming).

Thirdly it needs to be a supporting role. If you have boots on the ground there'll be expectations on them and resentment when those expectations aren't fulfilled.

Most of the rest can be managed. It might work in Syria but their opposition seems to be getting gutted. I see nothing that looks like Assad is in real danger.

Doctor Who isn't the most consistent with time travel (most stories aren't) but I like to look at the world in the block universe view (which according to theory is the only way time travel is possible): every point in time is equally real. The past is not gone, the future is not open. People and good times are not gone, they're just in another time, and still real.

Anyway, Doctor Who was really the first show I started watching that was live and not reality (I barely watched anything). I'd seen it around online and tuned in with my dad (we used to watch reruns of Star Trek: TNG) to the series 6 premiere (we did watch BBC America's series 5 recap first) and I loved it. Even though I didn't want to wait a whole week to see the conclusion. We didn't watch all of them together, and I got the series 5 DVDs from the library and caught up on my own, and later started watching series 1-4 when BBCA aired them (although due to their schedule I did not finish until the following year). My little brother and my mother were also around sometimes when I'd watch, even though Mom doesn't follow that closely and ends up confused when the alien shows up. I also got my best friend hooked and she watched all the episodes from series 5 and 6 (1-4 were harder to find on Dailymotion, sorry) and I saved the latter half of 6 (and later 7) as they aired because she doesn't have BBCA. Backing up a little, though, when ""Let's Kill Hitler"" aired my brother got to stay up and watch with me and popcorn, and it was so much fun...we cracked up at the ""You will die in 32 minutes"" scene. He hasn't seen the series in any particular order, just catching random episodes as I would watch them, but I have gotten Netflix this year and we've been watching some of the older ones together (mainly for K-9) and also *The X-Files*, my other favorite show. I won't say that we needed more bonding, but Doctor Who has really proved to be a great family activity. I can't wait until Christmastime! (I'm making my family watch ""A Christmas Carol"" too, because it's too good.)

I can't wait to introduce my kids to Doctor Who when I'm older...I'm probably just going to have episodes on every once and a while and they'll get used to it like my brother. I don't really like the idea of a ""correct"" way to watch Doctor Who.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;far more Iraqi's are dying now because of it than would have died otherwise

Well, we could argue this for years. Saddam had already invaded two of his neighbors, committed genocide and slaughtered countless people in his country, for nothing more than maintaining his grip on power and wealth. In addition, the huge majority of civilian deaths in Iraq were caused by other Iraqis, in no small part by militia groups in order to create a situation of sectarian conflict with a view to destabilize the country and eventually drive out the infidels. Can the commitment of the Jihadi's to mass murder honestly be blamed on the Americans or the British, when they made every effort to fight those same groups? 

In Iraq there are the beginnings of a democracy. In recent years the wahabi opposition to the US invasion has subsided to the point where the U.S can withdraw it's combat troops from the country. The baseline we start from now is far better than the situation under Saddam. 



&gt;On top of all this we have a resurgent power in Iran caused by the political upheaval in Iraq.

The Iranian government isn't 'resurgent'. It never disappeared only to flare up when Iraq was invaded. The same government has ruled there since the Islamic revolution.

The guy is a decent professional, he wants to play, he wants to be active and he wants to perform. He's not a ""LOL £50k a week to sit on my ass, HELL YEAH"" kind of player.

The problem is, his performances are sub-par. I know it, you know it, and many many other knows it. You know who else is privy to this knowledge? Clint Dempsey. You can bet your ass the man himself is disappointed about his performances and that might affect his confidence.

Now, I am of the mindset that Dempsey needs ""a rest"" not dropped. The guy is clearly not fitting in as well as he could, and negativity is building up. Dempsey first two issues are that he is not VdV and he is not Moutinho, people dislike him for that already. This is now developing into him become a target of frustrations (rightly or wrongly) for many spurs fans. What AVB needs to do is to rest him, give him a few games out to work on less physical side of things in training, such as positioning, tactics and movement within the team.

I don't think this because ""OMG HE IS RUINING THE TEAM"" but more because if he remains a target of frustration and hate from fans then in the long run he is just going to get worse, be demotivated and become an empty shell of the player he could be. He needs this break for himself, and not to appease irate supporters.

I will point out if the more hardcore minority that want him out of spurs altogether manage to push and get more people supporting their agenda, you are going to ruin a guy who could be a great player for us. You all know if Dempsey is at his best he can provide cover to many areas and that he is a decent player.

In short, Dempsey doesn't need dropped, he needs a break. He needs a break from the team for a few games to sort his head out, and more than this he needs a break from being the target of frustrated fans outbursts.",0,1352738538,null,0,false,0,c7086gt,t3_131kdv,t1_c7086gt,t3_131kdv,null,1430386131,8,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,8

How anyone can have faith in such a lazy player is beyond me. He works hard apparently. Anyone who has watched him in person knows the falseness of that statement. Refuses to make runs, blames other players for his laziness, drops deep for some reason and slows us up. 

It's mind-blowing to see what people describe as a good Torres performance nowadays. He ran around a bit yesterday and had a few good touches and that constitutes a good performance? Relative to his output for us since we signed him, maybe. Overall, another below average performance for the typical Premier League striker.

He is absolutely beyond reproach. There is no going back to the Torres of 2007. There is no going back to the Torres of 2009. There is no ""I believe in Torres, let's give him until January"". He's going to play for us until January because we have no other options. He won't find the elusive ""confidence"" he needs because it's not a lack of confidence, it's a malaise that has pervaded his every sinew - we shouldn't hold him to the standards of 2007 because that is the aberration, the anomaly. Whatever he was perceived to have he never had.

We've heard this message a million times and I hope that Rodgers gets his one or two players. We can argue that we need help or cover in the defense and the midfield but it's painfully clear that the first place we need to start is the goal-scoring.

Look at our League results... an extra goal-scorer (or two) could have been the difference in our draw against Newcastle, could have broken the tie against Stoke, could've been the derby win over Everton. If Skrtel doesn't make that mistake against Man City, that's three points there too.

Including the Chelsea match, if we got three points from at least a couple of those draws, we're talking about a completely different season.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; When we give thanks to our forebears today who have paid the ultimate sacrifice, we must continue to realise that it’s not about the tanks we own, or the ships we possess. Any nation can have a large military, but it’s about a deeper willingness to accept and understand that there are times when it must be employed for a greater good, often at a cost of treasure and blood.

The greater good has never existed. It has always been spite and economics—always, even going back as far as the Crusades. It's why we aren't in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, or any other of the ""friendly dictatorships"". Hell, the USA should be invaded to oust that fascist nightmare. They could be then deployed back home to oust the one here.

It's a fiction that allows for the legitimisation of any offensive measures because the other party is cast as sub-human through a perverted sense of entitlement born of a pseudo-moral supremacy. The same goes for ""the greater good"" surrounding any anti-libertarian ""terrorist"" counter measures: indefinite detention, secret courts, secret evidence, stop-n-searches, internet surveillance, armed police in stations, increased budgets, etc. People like to talk of benefits entitlement but the real problem is at the macro political-financial-military level and the micro—""say that again and I'll smash your face in"", petulant driving and road rage, ""we are great britain the football team should always win"". We are *a** nation that suffers pride.

There are only two reasons for war(ish) behaviour:

1. the ability to project control over a population and have them work for you, or in other words, to extract surplus. This can be in the form of plundered resources but more subtly and for the longer term payoff you impose a favourable currency. Currency is a means of exchange, so controlling the monetary system of a ""colony"" is key because then you can be the remote silent middle-man of nearly all social interactions. You get to inflate, depress and tax whilst giving the illusion of economic freedom. At the end of nearly all conflicts currency is the first change; it was at play in Iraq, Libya, the Nazi party broke out of the post WW1 depression partly due to their own fiat money supply decoupled from internationally coordinated gold standards, and of course in places like Greece and Spain presently.

true,CannibalHolocaust,uk,London,"&gt;I think we should be incredibly careful. Libya was a case I supported. Intervention is easy to get wrong and very hard to get right. We did roughly the best that could be managed in Libya but the historic trends do not look like this.

&gt;All intervention needs to first be backed with a credible alternative on the ground in the nation in question. This was the problem in Afghanistan and Iraq. No credible alternative to the Taleban and Baath party.

The difference here is the opposition to the regime has been driven internally, starting with mass protests within Syria about a year ago. Obviously given the nature of Syria being autocratic, political parties are banned but we do have opposition blocs like the Syrian National Council, the National Coordination Committee for the Forces of Democratic Change, the Kurdish Supreme Committee and the newly formed umbrella organisation, the Syrian National Coalition for Opposition and Revolutionary Forces which encompasses all of the above groups. It should be noted the SNC in Syria was modelled on the Libyan Transitional Council which turned out to be successful so I don't know why we'd back the TNC in Libya but abandon the SNC in Syria. The SNC is also led by a Christian, George Sabra and was previously led by a Kurd so it's clearly not a sectarian organisation. 

Libya (and possibly Sierra Leone) is the only reasonable comparison to Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan were completely different invasions for completely different reasons (relating to security rather than humanitarianism). Libya and Syria were both internally driven uprisings with foreign elements later joining in (on both sides of the war).

&gt;Secondly it needs wide ranging support. In Libya we had the support of the Arab League, UN and NATO in general (ironically needing to drag the Americans into it kicking and screaming).

Syria has been kicked out of the Arab League and members have been strongly supporting the opposition with arms and resources as well as demanding the overthrow of Assad. They are basically occupying the same position as Libya but this time Syria has more support from Russia/China.

&gt;Thirdly it needs to be a supporting role. If you have boots on the ground there'll be expectations on them and resentment when those expectations aren't fulfilled.

I don't think you'd need boots on the ground at all. The rebels have captured large swathes of territory and are only pinned back because of the Syrian regime's airpower and artillery strikes. A no-fly zone would get rid of that factor and they'd manage to gain territory pretty quickly. It'd also reduce their reliance on foreign jihadis for assistance. Libya had the same problem but got out of it because they received other forms of assistance from the international community. Currently it's only really Turkey and Qatar who are providing non-jihadi assistance to the rebels.

&gt;Most of the rest can be managed. It might work in Syria but their opposition seems to be getting gutted. I see nothing that looks like Assad is in real danger. Whereas in Libya the rebels had seized control of Bengazi and looked a serious threat to Gaddafi before we got involved. They were losing when we intervened but had demonstrated materially that they were a viable alternative. Not some slash and burn group who'd topple government without being able to take control.

The Syrian rebels are actually in a similar position to the Libyan ones prior to the no-fly zone. They've captured huge swathes of territory including key border crossings, they are in control of large parts of Aleppo and skirmishes are occurring on a regular basis in Damascus. They're actually more advanced than the Libyan rebels were before intervention and they've managed to hold out far longer than the Libyan rebels would have without a no-fly zone in place. The reason the no-fly zone was pushed for was because the Libyan rebels were about to get pulverised unless Libya's air support was taken out. The Syrians have been on the receiving end of regular air strikes but are still controlling large parts of Syria whereas the Libyan rebels would have been defeated pretty quickly.",0,1352741061,null,0,false,0,c708v57,t3_131zrn,t1_c708v57,t1_c707a5b,null,1430386523,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Because of the new box issue, there's huge resistance to changing the basic Freeview parameters; I see it as unlikely that we'll change for at least another 10 years due to install base issues, and even then, we'll probably just drop DVB-T and MPEG-2, keeping current Freeview HD boxes in working order; note that the move to DVB-T2 changes muxes from 24MBit/s to 40MBit/s at the same signal quality, and H.264 uses around half the bitrate of H.262 for the same picture quality, so a move to Freeview HD receivers for everything would allow us to fit the current 5 SD muxes worth of channels into 3 muxes, reducing us from 6 muxes total to 4 muxes total. Additionally, we could fit Freeview into a tighter spectrum allocation by having some of those 4 muxes be SFNs (single frequency used by all transmitters sending the same content - so different frequencies to allow for things like Welsh language programming).

Finally, remember that Ofcom conducts feasibility studies without necessarily committing to changes; it may well want to quantify the costs of clearing the 700 MHz band for LTE, so that if an operator gets interested, Ofcom can do what it's doing for the 800 MHz band, and insist that the winning bidders pay the cost of clearing the band - for the 800 MHz band, the winning bidders will have to cover the full cost of clearing Freeview out of the way before they can start deployment in that band, which is estimated at £180 million. If the cost of clearing the 700 MHz band is (say) £500 million, and the network operators say that they ""need"" more spectrum, Ofcom can point to the study, and say ""well, it'll cost you £500 million to clear the 700 MHz band, plus the cost of the spectrum licence.

My biggest issue with completely giving up on him is with the treatment he's received since he moved to us. From the very first second, he was under a lot of pressure, which you expect any footballer worth his salt to thrive under. Problem is he wasn't given a steady run to settle into the team - makes sense since he was a young player and Kenny wasn't keen on blooding him in that quickly. Combine the pressure and lack of first team football though and I feel sorry for the lad.

That being said, I like Andy as a player so I hope he goes on to do well, but unfortunately just can't see it happening with us so I hope we sell him ASAP to fund a new striker.

It's hardly ancient history when the leader in question is still in power. And whilst it's true that he was stable - it's entirely false that he was not butchering people. His prisons and police state functioned as normal during this period (Between the gulf wars), where thousands were killed or tortured to maintain the regime.


&gt;Yes because they were under control before the war happened.

Whilst this is true, the 'control' you are talking about is the systematic repression of an entire country. It isn't solving the multitude of ethnic issues Iraq has either, and if your solution to such problems is that you simply install an autocratic brute to govern, then I put it to you you're no better at heart than every empire builder in history.

&gt;Iran's power, or the perception thereof, has increased massively

I dispute the contention Iran's power has increased massively, and the perception of something in the public eye doesn't make it true. While it's true they've gained influence in Iraq, the effect of this remains to be seen. Any leverage that the Iranians can get, they'll take,  as they have in the past with Hezbollah,Syria, Bahrain and others. 

Al-sistani (Iraq's most respected Shiite cleric) has long opposed the Iranian model as his particular school of thought does not wish clerics to play a role in government. I bring this up only to help make you understand the limited role that Iran's influence might possibly hold in Iraq, where there are plenty of Shia political entities when compared with somewhere like Lebanon, where the Shia were under-represented and Iran took the opportunity to create and nurture Hezbollah.


&gt;It has made Saudi Arabia very twitchy and has led to the current stand off.

Not sure what stand off you are referring to. If it was the nuclear stand off with the IAEA you are referring to, you'd be wrong.

Second, one thing that you didn't include is the prospect and quantity of players on loan for each team. United has only two players on loan, City have 5 (2 of which are Santa Cruz and Bridge - aka on their way out), compared to Chelsea's 10. Of those 10, the list includes the likes of McEachran, Lukaku, De Bruyne, Hutchinson, Courtois and Bruma - all of whom are highly regarded for their potential to play, and are much talked about by the club and fans alike. All of these players, including Essien (not sure where his future lies), would add amazing depth to at least every part of the pitch. 

Yes, they are not all proven like their United or City youth-counterparts but I believe they deserve a chance, and many of them will get that chance in time.

In regards to key positions where we need quality depth, I'd say CBs and strikers are the main concern, as has been evident in recent weeks with injuries, suspensions and lack of goals from the strikers. I believe CBs are less of a worry if Hutchinson and Bruma are deemed high enough quality as backup. The main argument, as we've all been a part of on this subreddit is the striker dilemma. What does the club do? bring back Lukaku and see how that goes? Swap someone for Torres? Bring someone in to play alternately to Torres? What about Sturridge? Many unanswered questions that will at least have to wait until the January transfer window for some sort of resolution. Personally, we need another quality striker. City have a wealth of options, United grabbed Van Persie to make their front line an even bigger threat, while Chelsea just backed up their strikers with great attacking midfielders. CFC needs both, and Torres just isn't cutting it week-in, week-out. 

Chelsea need a proper plan B for when things don't work out on the pitch. Without that, they'll keep dropping points when they could be getting the full 3.",0,1352745497,null,0,false,0,c70a44k,t3_132k2b,t1_c70a44k,t3_132k2b,null,1430387121,9,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,9

&gt;The Indian economy was 25% of the world GDP when the british came. It was 5% when the british left. Is this a coincidence? Of course not! By the way, this is not me saying this it's our Cambridge-educated economist PM Manmohan Singh.
British atrocities in India simply cannot be overstated. What the British have done to india is much more terrible crime than pretty much anything that has ever happened to any group of people in Europe. But do you think westerners will ever acknowledge this? Of course not! They'll just blame us for being poor and uneducated and boast about their own superiority without realizing that their riches are directly stolen from us.
It enrages me that british did all this and then just walked away leaving us to clean up the mess. In 1947 we were left with a population of of 300 million a literacy rate of 15% and per-capita income that is 200 times lesser than what it is today. We should all keep this in context the next time we complain about India. Given where we started from and where are today, we've made tremendous progress in getting modern India to where it is now.

Lets break that down, just for you r/unitedkingdom

&gt;The Indian economy was 25% of the world GDP when the british came. It was 5% when the british left.

I have no idea how this data exists (I doubt it does exist) but the Industrial Revolution may be something to do with it.

&gt;They'll just blame us for being poor and uneducated and boast about their own superiority without realizing that their riches are directly stolen from us.

I doubt people do say that.

&gt;It enrages me that british did all this and then just walked away leaving us to clean up the mess.

What does that even mean?

&gt;In 1947 we were left with a population of of 300 million a literacy rate of 15% and per-capita income that is 200 times lesser than what it is today. 

Actually is was 6 times less than it was today, the United Kingdom's has grown about the same in that data bracket. I would also add that the income division in India is much greater and there is more poverty.

Russia has a similar problem. Although it has a stronger, more experienced military than China it also lacks the ability to send an expeditionary force to Syria and support them while they are deployed. Any deployments via air would have to cross Turkish airspace (and naval deployments from the Black Sea would have to go via Istanbul), and NATO wouldn't allow that.

One way might be to look at the profits generated by the beneficial owner of a company and subject those to tax in some way. Now the beneficial owner might be in a different jurisdiction so I don't know if it would be possible to enforce.

I would say if there is some arrangement where money is transferred elsewhere in a beneficial ownership chain and ends up being taxed at a lower rate than the UK corporate tax rate, then that is by default an arrangement specifically designed to avoid UK tax.

So I would like general anti avoidance laws saying that money generated from UK business cannot be taxed lower than the UK corporate tax rate.

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"It's not just a company, it's a corporation; a 'body corporate' formed by a Royal Charter - this sounds arcane but it's important - it means the BBC has a 'legal personality' and has the status of Personhood in law. 
Another type of corporation in British law is a 'corporation sole' which attaches to an office and to any person currently holding the office for example; the Archbishop of Canterbury. 

When people question trust in the BBC it's not JUST 'The BBC' as an entity they're questioning, it's commitment of the general public to this weird set up we have in the U.K. Other countries don't have anything like the BBC organisation wise, sure some of them have public broadcasters, but none come anywhere close to the scale of the Beeb. We are unique in having a public broadcaster be dominant in the market and it's a fragile state of affairs, it's one of the only corporations of its type left, most were got rid of in the 1980s under Thatcher. 

Most other media outlets in the U.K are owned by people either directly or indirectly for profit or propaganda - The Sun by Murdoch, I.T.V by share holders, The Mail by their general trust.... etc.

The BBC is owned by all of us but obviously not everyone can have a direct say in every decision made, that's why there's a structure in place - journalists reporting to editors who report to managers who report to heads of departments who report to directors who report to governors and the trust who report to Parliament to MPs who report to us.  It's not a private company accountable to only a small group of share holders, it has a significant different set up to that, one that means Parliament has the ability to make substantive changes, they could even decide to scrap the Royal Charter and the funding all together. When you're asked 'Do you trust the BBC' what they are really asking is broken down to two questions: 

Firstly do you trust their impartiality - do you trust them to be following their own ethos and secondly do you trust the PROCESS? Do you believe that enough people in the layers from the lowliest runner to the mightiest member of the Trust is doing a good enough job that when you see the 10 o'clock News of an evening you can be confident in what you're hearing?  

The question MATTERS because you as a puny individual don't get usually get any say in the operation or existence of a private company in which you're not a shareholder, but you COULD choose to vote for an MP who promises to scrap the BBC and if enough people did that it would be gone. Trust is not an asset the BBC can afford to lose any great amount of for any length of time. It would be fatal.

But the idea that there is an endemic problem with militant Islam in the UK, that Muslims threaten the culture and way of life of British people is ludicrous.  They (EDL, etc.) see themselves (white, male, Christians) under threat in a country that is predominantly white, Christian, and, well, still very institutionally sexist, frankly. The idea that a native racial majority is under attack from a (historically persecuted) minority is one of the hallmarks of fascism.

true,[deleted],null,null,"**RB:** I'm not too worried. I'd say the two Manchester sides have slightly more depth but not substantially more. As far as quality goes I think we are fine if either Iva or Azpi gets injured. If they both get injured then yes, we will have to figure something out. Bertrand could deputize there. 

**CB:** I agree with you here. The issue I think is that we don't really have a young CB or a player who can deputize at CB in a pinch without having to rot on the bench all year as a ""just in case"". Our best 5th choice would be Bruma but I don't see recalling him. Chalobah is a bit too young as is Kalas and they should both stay out on loan. Romeu theoretically can deputize there although he wouldn't be anywhere near the quality of Smalling, Jones, Toure etc...

**CM:** Our biggest issue for me. Even more of an issue than striker. Let's take the Liverpool and Swansea games for example. We reached a point in both games where we stopped really creating good chances. Our only option was to bring on Sturridge or Moses and add a little livelyness up front. It never really amounted to anything because we still hadn't changed anything in the most influential area of the pitch. For me a plan B should always start in CM. Change of shape or adding more control, changing the midfield dynamic, or adding more directness can substantially change a game in a way  that simply swapping out strikers won't always do. We have no options in CM to change a game. I don't see Lampard remaining injury/fatigue free all season. I think we should take of the option of recalling one of KDB, JMac, or Essien. Recalling Essien would solve our CB/RB cover as well but KDB would give us a new dimension. An alternative would be to start getting Oscar into the midfield more. 

**AMs:** Not really an issue but we need to start rotating more. 2 of our key players, Hazard &amp; Oscar, are playing their FIRST SEASONS IN THE EPL. Very susceptible to burnout IMO. 

**Strikers:** Not even close as you say. Our second major weakness. Yes the two Manchester teams typically play more than one striker but they have options and versatility on the striking front. Even with a lone striker system you still need options. As with the CM position we have no way to change a game or  bring on an entirely different type of player. Less options also make it harder to tactically exploit different oppositions. 

**Final thoughts:** I don't think that we can't even think about winning the league but I do think that we should not expect to. Generally the teams that win this league are teams that are flexible from back to front. We are only really flexible in our AM department. We certainly have the quality to win the league (and I don't mean this like Arsenal fans say it) but it won't be easy (it rarely is anyway). Injuries will make it extremely difficult and we've been lucky on the injury front so far this season. You also have the consider than Man City will not be progressing in the CL, allowing them to further focus on the league. The ideal situation for me would be 1 loan recall in CM, make a SMART buy on a striker, and a little more rotation up front.

That the far-left is dangerous in the same way as the far-right is a huge misconception. It literally doesn't make any sense to think that, unless you don't understand the first think about Revolutionary Socialism/Marxism/etc. You keep going on about Stalin + Soviet Union as if they were left wing; as a totalitarian, undemocratic state the USSR and Stalin were decidedly not left-wing. But that's a whole other discussion I don't really want to get bogged down in. 

You seem to think that fascism is only defined by using violence against political opponents, this is not the case. There are many definitions of fascism/nazism/et al that vary, and admittedly the term 'fascist' is often used loosely, but key components of the far-right idealogy are ideas about racial purity, nationalism, dictatorship and discipline. These things are all very not left-wing. So calling UAF fascist just shows you don't actually know what fascism is.

The reason for the 'no-platform' policy (the idea that racist/fascist groups should not be allowed to communicate their views publically) is not simply because left-wing groups disagree with racism, it is that hate speech will lead to prejudice, discrimination and ultimately violence against minorities if left unchecked. Racist views are objectively unnacceptable. We should not as a society and as individuals tolerate hate-speech. 

The EDL is a street movement. It travels to communities from other areas of the country to intimidate minority groups there. There are not interested in discussion. Their views are vile. And while not every one of them sets out to get into fights, many of them do, requiring people to be prepared to defend minority groups from them if they kick off. All the time they are being aggressive towards anti-fascists, they are not threatening ethnic groups. Groups that already feel vulnerable. Think of anti-fascists as a smoke-screen, directing any violence from EDL towards people who can handle it and are prepared to be hated at. 

Another useful thing that anti-fascists, like those in Norwich on Saturday, do is show how crazy and aggressive groups like the EDL are, so the public can see for themselves. It barely takes anything to set them off, and photographs like the ones the person above took show that many of them are a bunch of nutters! People need to see this, because far-right groups are very good at spin!

EDL isn't 'the same' as the Golden Dawn, but again, they do believe similar things. We are in the worst economic recession since the 30s and it only takes a little push and before you know it organised fascism has taken over huge swathes of the country (as it has in Greece at a terrifying rate). As Hitler himself said, if the Nazis had been crushed from the beginning when they were still small they would not have succeeded. Sure you may not be a fan of needless violence. Well nobody is if it's needless! But I argue that if we put down groups like the EDL now we will save a hell of a lot of lives in the future. So it isn't needless violence.

true,Mr_Wolfgang_Beard,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;So neither Russia or China could actually do anything in active military terms, unless it was to start a major shooting war with Europe and the US.

Exactly! No-one ever claimed the war would be *in Syria*, they said it would just kick off WW3. A *World War*. A war that occurs all over the world.

Russia and China aren't preventing western intervention by patrolling the Syrian border with tanks on the lookout for western forces on the way. No they're preventing it by saying ""Don't you fucking dare!""  
Russia and China are at the end of their tether when it comes to putting up with America putting restrictions on their military actions but running around ~~invading~~ ""saving democracy"" wherever they please. They see it as a huge double standard and hypocritical. The only thing keeping their imperialism in check is the western threat of intervention, but the opposite is also true.

If the west were to do as specofdust suggests and just stride into Syria saying ""We're doing whatever the fuck we like in Syria, regardless of the UN's opinion; and there's fuck all you two can do about it thanks to geography!"" then it wouldn't be surprising to hear them respond in kind with ""We're going to do whatever the fuck we like in Japan/the Philippines/Korea/Georgia/Estonia/Ukraine/Belarus/..., regardless of the UN's opinion; and there's fuck all you lot can do about it thanks to geography!""

This is a transition season and while it is nice to keep winning and take some pressure off as the season progresses, in reality 3rd place and a good CL/Cup run are as good as can be hoped for.

We're also entirely predictable at the moment and while Mata, Hazard, Oscar is a great trio, it's obvious you'll be facing them so easier to plan on stopping some of the danger. There is a serious risk of burnout too as Oscar and Hazard are playing in their first full season in England

It was nice to see the closing down at times yesterday, a lot of players really put a shift in, but effort isn't enough. Mikel and Ramires lack the ability to split a defence or spread the ball around so you see the trio dropping back deeper to dictate the possession game just inside the opposition half, this leaves Torres as the sole forward and frankly he's doing well if the ball doesn't bounce off him.

Russia doesn't care nearly enough about Syria to actually fight over it, and China doesn't give two shits about them because they've got no money.

I guess you weren't paying attention to what was happening in the UN when violence in Syria first broke out - Russia and China blocked it. They do care about it. What they care even more about is the state of diplomatic relationships between them and the US/West. If the west starts saying ""Fuck you we do what we want!"" then why would they not respond in kind?

Also, he is extremely quick, so the next few years are when he should shine the most. Players that rely on speed tend to wane once they hit 25 or so.

true,[deleted],null,null,"AVB got sacked in March last year and we were on 46 points in 27 GP. Just for argument's sake let's call 48 points the 'SACK ZONE' This about on the edge of 4th or 5th place in March usually.  Right now were at 24 points in 11 played. 16 league games till March so that is 48 points worth of games. In that time our toughest fixtures are Man City twice and Arsenal once. The rest are fixtures we *should* win, although of course it doesn't work like that. We would need to drop 22 points from those 16 games. 6 Losses and 2 draws, or 11 draws, or 4  losses and 5 draws, etc...At our current season rate of 24 points per 33 we can expect about 35 more points in those next 16 games ending up about 11 points above the sack zone. That is a pretty good cushion. Manager aside, our squad is considerably stronger than last year. With the squad we have I think we can be reasonably assured that unless our current blip turns in a a catastrophe we will be okay. Although anything is possible.

However, said SACK ZONE is a flexible number and is largely dependent on performance in other competitions as well as previous managerial accolades. For instance, in the 2010/2011 season, Ancelotti found himself at 48 points in March but was allowed to keep his job due to the trophies he won the years previous as well as a solid in the Champions League. We also managed to finish 2nd that season with a chance to finish first despite our poor winter performance. Had we beaten Man U in the league or in the CL that year things might have gone different for Carlo. At least he was given until the end of the year.

In AVB's case he had yet to prove himself at Chelsea and our CL performance was awful. After just eeking through the group stages we put on one of the worst CL performances we ever have against Napoli. These factors meant there was less leniency for the SACK ZONE.

In RDM's case he did win the CL last year so I would expect that unless things go horribly horribly wrong he will last at least until the end of the year. Getting through the CL group stages and maintaining current league performance will be crucial though.

**TL;DR:** Yes hypothetically anything is possible. The most likely scenario however is that RDM will last at least until the end of the season. Not losing to Juve, winning our easier fixtures, and taking some points from Man City/Arsenal in the coming months will likely determine that. It all seems a quite reasonable task though.

I broadly agree that the energy trilemma is worth investment, but the timing comes down to your stand on economics. Some would argue the bond yields are only where they are due to austerity. Others are feeling more Keynesian. I'm more wait and see.


&gt;it could be said that the point that we privatised our energy is around the same point that we stopped investing heavily in the future of energy production.

It could also be said that we privatised our energy when we realised how much investment was required due to years of neglect.

And in even more coherent words, I never suggested that they would. You can't win arguments by making up comments to debunk. I don't even think the US wants to get involved in this conflict, given they had to be dragged into Libya. If you bother to read the rest of my posts I've consistently talked about the need for Europe to start taking it's regional security more seriously. We can't rely on the Americans anymore, they are more focused on the Pacific. What we need to do is work with the Arab League to take out Syrian government forces, control the rebels and ensure that the country has a passable transition to a regime that we can work with. 

My point was that Russian and Chinese forces really couldn't do anything about this other than protest because they lack the type of military which can operate effectively outside of their respective borders. Russia has some marines in Tartus, but so long as they were left alone their would be no way for them to enter the fight without starting a war they would lose badly. 

The aim here has to be to ensure that Syria transitions into something we can work with, and not some nightmarish fundamentalist state we'll struggle to control in the future that tries to start a war with Israel.

I've not found the ideal interface metaphor yet. I don't want a window but a portal, and I don't want to shuffle pieces of paper around or keep file cabinets tidy, or deal with random popups (browser and OS). I don't want secret hidden dot files either. I also want to be able to easily view any remote information fetched locally offline. I don't even want invisible characters like `\r\t\n`. Neither do I want those preference tabs that have no real ordering so you have to look at 5 or 6 pages before you realise the thing you want isn't an option.

I feel the browser in many respects is a virtual machine trying to smooth over the cracks left by Windows®, accidental and deliberate. I want one tiling (portal) manager, Xmonad might come closest, where I set up the tiling geometry that never stacks and I can issue any portal to be a view into any app whether that app is my local chat client, web page or anything else. Most of all I want text to be display in the font of my choosing with no paragraph width where information adjusts to any size of pane. It pisses me off no end when I find a site that prevents magnification by ushering text off the screen horizontally because of absolute formatting rules. I don't think any one wants to read txt 250 characters wide (or in Comic Sans). I want none of the apps or even web pages to be able to share data or make network connections without my explicit approval, so none of this Guardian and 459 adbright cookie business (not that I read that rag anymore).

Oh right. Okay then.

&gt;The Indian economy was 25% of the world GDP when the british came. It was 5% when the british left. Is this a coincidence? Of course not!

You can't *steal* GDP, when the British took over most of the world was in subsitance farming or starting to move into industrial based economies. In 1948 when we left, the entire of Western Europe had industrialised **and** USA **and** Japan, their GDP's increasing exponentially over years. So it wasn't that we ""stole"" India's GDP, it's that in relation the rest of the world's GDP it had decreased.

&gt;What the British have done to india is much more terrible crime than pretty much anything that has ever happened to any group of people in Europe.

Which propped up the front and prevented the Japanese from swarming into the subcontinent, and we all know how benevolent they would have been; [wouldn't we](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanking_Massacre). Or maybe [this?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731).

Steven Moffat's Doctor Who is even more sci-fi than RTD's with all the time travel and 51st century set stories with space ships and stuff. There are some of those power of love/friendship stories (Craig basically) but it's more sci-fi now.

As for internal logic, Doctor Who has always contradicted itself and changed. Steven Moffat's Doctor Who is about fairy tales and complex plots and super fast adventure. RTD's Doctor Who is about the beauty of the universe and of ordinary people. Heck, the Doctor Who of the late 70s was all about gothic horror and alien baddies. The Doctor Who of the early 80s was like a boy's adventure novel series, the Doctor Who of the early 70s was like a James Bond adventure movie with aliens thrown in. What Doctor Who ""is"" changes all the time.

Characters overcoming difficulties with the power of love doesn't actually happen -that- much. I'd like a list of the number of times it happens in RTD and Moffat Who in comparison before I'd believe that. Archangel Network or not, that's pretty much the culmination of RTD's season 3 finale anyways. And even -that- isn't technically bad writing.

It was different, what that was stopping was world domination, not conflict in small shitty nations (which happened many times during the cold war). Plus, as you know, the cold war is over.

&gt;No Russia blocked it because it has political ties with the Syrian government and China blocked it because it is allied with Russia. 

China and Russia are not friends. They do some joint military exercises, sure, but China will probably eat half of Russia sometime before 2100, and the Russians are plenty wary of the Chinese' growing power. Russia certainly does has political ties with Syria, they're it's last ally in the middle east, but they know they're losing it regardless, and they would never have invested military might in protecting the Syrian regime from a western or international intervention.

&gt;Don't be so naive. There are hundereds of tragedies that occur every day that the West does nothing to prevent. Everyone on the planet knows we're only trying to intervene in this crisis because of the larger politics involved in it.

IMO RDM should not give Torres the same freedom as our attacking mids. He too often drops deep even when we are dominating in midfield. Torres should be given specific instructions to play off the last defender and stretch defenders away from our AMs. AT ALL TIMES.

The only real text in the linked article is the bit that starts *""there is absolutely no historical account of any major famine in Bengal prior...""*, which is attributed to Amartya Sen, who is a well-known, Nobel prize winning economist. But when you track it down, that text, and the text that follows, including *""The Holocaust in Germany was a minor event compared to what the British did to a people, who trusted them and were loyal to them.""* is from [this article](http://www.samarthbharat.com/bengalholocaust.htm), which mentions Amartya Sen, but is actually written by some other guy called Anil Chawla, who describes himself as *""an engineer (and now a lawyer too) by qualification but a philosopher by vocation and a management consultant by profession""*, which sounds like something David Brent would write. 

The top comment talks about 1.8 billion deaths from 1760-1950, and this being the greatest crime in history, but the same author who gave that quote also says [here](http://www.countercurrents.org/polya201111.htm) that: 

&gt; ""1.8 billion avoidable Indian deaths from deprivation under the genocidal British over 2 centuries is not that surprising when one considers that despite modern medicine, antibiotics, and the essential absence of famine avoidable deaths from deprivation in the period 1950-2005 in India and South Asia totaled totalled 0.35 billion and 0.47 billion, respectively""

So 1.8 billion avoidable deaths constitutes the worst crime in history, but post-Independence India has had 0.35 billion preventable deaths, which would be 1.2 billion if extended out to the 190 years of British rule.

Sorry, it's just that specofdust has been arguing for the idea that ""WW3 wouldn't happen because Russia and China wouldn't start it just over Syria"", whereas I've been arguing ""The US won't just barge into Syria because Russia and China would start WW3 over it."" I assumed that when you disagreed with me it was because you agreed with specofdust about Russia and China not being capable of stopping the US and not being willing to start WW3 over it. I take it that is that not the case?

&gt;I don't even think the US wants to get involved in this conflict, given they had to be dragged into Libya. If you bother to read the rest of my posts I've consistently talked about the need for Europe to start taking it's regional security more seriously. We can't rely on the Americans anymore, they are more focused on the Pacific. What we need to do is work with the Arab League to take out Syrian government forces, control the rebels and ensure that the country has a passable transition to a regime that we can work with. 

I'm very happy to say that I wholeheartedly agree with you on this topic, and if the [+16] I have next to your name is any indication I believe that I find myself to generally agree with you on most political matters.

&gt;My point was that Russian and Chinese forces really couldn't do anything about this other than protest because they lack the type of military which can operate effectively outside of their respective borders.

Indeed. However my concern is that ""their"" protest may take the form of also ignoring the UN's decisions and further degrading diplomatic relationships - and with all the unrest between China and the other nations of the pacific going on right now (and given how many of those nations have close ties with the US) that could turn very bad very quickly. *Especially* if we were to do it with specofdust's attitude; [""If an actually interionational group of nations got together and said they were going into Syria there is no way Russia or China would even try to stand in their way.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/131zrn/british_army_faces_being_sent_to_syria_if/c704qmd) (i.e. ""You can't stop us we're ignoring your opinion."") rather than a more diplomatic approach.

&gt;The aim here has to be to ensure that Syria transitions into something we can work with, and not some nightmarish fundamentalist state we'll struggle to control in the future that tries to start a war with Israel.

true,severedfragile,lfc68,,"&gt;It's not irrational, some people actually believe that he is a racist.

Firstly, that in itself is a pretty irrational belief. The evidence against him is pretty tenuous, and even the guy he allegedly racially abused has said he doesn't think Suarez is a racist, so for random people on the internet to think they know better, despite all that and evidence such as his ancestry, friendships and charity work, is pretty damn irrational.

Secondly, let's say he is a racist. Does that make every move he makes evil? It does if you don't feel the need to be rational about it.

By that I mean, the interactions between more distant relationships - helping out strangers, sacrificing the self for others (not necessarily loved ones), defending universal freedoms, the power of the many. 

In 11's stories, they are much more intimate. The love between a couple, trust between a couple, links between parent and child, the force that the feelings another can have over you, even if you don't know it.

(I wonder if anyone can name the episodes I'm thinking of when I name the above themes).

The community spirit, utopian type ideas that Davies/Tennant/Eccleston's era put forward were big, big pulls for me; those kinds of themes and settings always interest me (Star Trek, BSG I suppose).  

I miss the grandeur of Davies stuff, but I equally appreciate the new intimacy that Moffat has brought.

This is a good resource for someone going with you. How to help etc. So make sure your nan has a look through it if you can't get someone from either CAB or a disability charity that deal with benefits. 

Also, have you seen the actual guidelines and how they actually score you? They're very crafty during the assessments by asking things like 'Do you enjoy reading?' and inferring from that stuff like concentration or ability to sit still for extended periods of time. When you know what they're looking for and how they award you points it's much easier to steer them in the right direction to awarding you points by answering to the previous question 'Yes but I'm not able to sit for longer than x minutes and I can only concentrate for x minutes'. Rather than letting them jump to their own conclusions. You can find them under the 'medical descriptors' bit of this website www.esahelp.co.uk/

Hope it goes well and don't be afraid to appeal if necessary. As already mentioned the overturn rate is about 70%-75% if you have someone with you during your appeal. Preferably someone from CAB or a disability charity. You should have plenty of time to see someone from one of these after being told their decision and last I knew they keep you on ESA during the appeal so don't let them put you on JSA.

I got a 1970s Puch road bike for £50 from him, Sturmey Archer gears and everything, and I got the impression he's mainly doing it as a sideline because he likes restoring bikes, probably be willing to buy it back from you when you head back to the States. 

He's a bit slow to upload photos of stock, so it might be worth dropping him an email to ask if he's got anything cheap that'll do you for a few months.

Alternatively, BikeZone on St Michaels' Street or up in Summertown.

Avoid CycleKing, they're hardcore shysters and even if you only need the bike for a few months it's 50-50 if it'll last that long.

true,Mr_Wolfgang_Beard,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;It was different, what that was stopping was world domination, not conflict in small shitty nations (which happened many times during the cold war). 

Yes. Proxy Wars were prevelant during the Cold War, and I have no intention of watching the conflict in Syria turn into another one.

&gt;Plus, as you know, the cold war is over.

Yes and what we've been talking about this whole time is the fact that [your stance](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/131zrn/british_army_faces_being_sent_to_syria_if/c704qmd?context=1) would trigger the next one.

&gt;China and Russia are not friends. They do some joint military exercises, sure, but China will probably eat half of Russia sometime before 2100, and the Russians are plenty wary of the Chinese' growing power. Russia certainly does has political ties with Syria, they're it's last ally in the middle east, but they know they're losing it regardless, and they would never have invested military might in protecting the Syrian regime from a western or international intervention.

Yes, that is all true. But what you propose is the US and the rest of the West saying ""Fuck you Russia, fuck you China, and fuck you UN; we're strong enough to ignore your rulings!"" - the growing unrest in the Pacific right now means that China would *love* to justify an invasion of Japan or the Philippenes with ""Well the West clearly isn't interested in listening to us any more. Why should we continue to listen to them?""

&gt;I wasn't talking about state goals, I was suggesting my own one. So lets not go calling people naive on the assumption that because they happen to support a similar stance to another group, that they support it for identical reasons ;)

Ok whatever. We are talking about an action that could lead to WW3 - a war that would likely end in a nuclear holocaust.

Take someone with you.

As others have said, they're very crafty. For example, telling them about your favourite soap operas gets put down as 'Able to sit comfortably for extended periods of time', and so on. Unfortunately, because of they way they skew it towards what you are assessed as *capable* of, not what you *can't* do, your problem is one they'd easily ~~use to reach their targets~~ mistakenly assess as fit for work.

Be very clear about what you *cannot* do, even if it goes against our national stance of ""mustn't grumble"". Maybe it's catch a bus, or visit family if one of them has a cold, or whatever. You know more about the condition than them - it often isn't even a doctor doing the assessment, let alone any specialist.

Contact them tomorrow and insist on your right (yes, it's been confirmed as such by government) for the meeting to be recorded. They almost certainly will tell you it can't, that the equipment isn't available etc., and they refuse to let you bring your own.

Its obvious how much she changed him and kept him from becoming a monster and something that he would have hated.  They had a strong bond and friendship.  My least favorite is Martha - I liked her but I disliked their relationship. I didn't like that she was like a love sick puppy and felt she was chasing after him but I liked how clever she was.  I felt like the relationship they had wasn't very good for her.  I'm looking forward to the new companion, but that is because she is a brunette (as am I) so I could cosplay as her! 
I seem to be the only person to say this, but one of my least favorite episodes is the Girl in the Fireplace.  I really liked the characters, but the doctor is ready to abandon Rose at the drop of a hat and thinks that he can't get back to her. He starts thinking that he's going to have to actually get money, etc.  I felt it was out of character for him to do this and it kinda ruined the episode for me.  One of my favorites is a silly episode - The Next Doctor.  I liked how at first the doctor is thinking it could be a future incarnation and then it turns out to be a mistake but it was a really enjoyable episode for me.

Perhaps Davies/10 was more about the scifi aspect of storytelling to you, but I think some of the most emotional episodes came out of his run (10 leaving Rose on the beach, anyone?). However, I guess I do agree that Moffat/11 is more about character building with a scifi/fantasy backdrop. This is evident in the higher quality production, editing, what story choices they have made, etc. It's a different vision, but I think a valid and potentially a great one. There have been some stumbles, but humanizing the Doctor brings such a personal element to the show that I couldn't possibly turn my nose up at it. I don't think relying on emotions is ""cheap"" storytelling because it's something that most people can relate to; in the midst of something alien and strange, this group of companions is making decisions based on feelings we've all experienced.

-------------------------

Reports and educated guesses would suggest that **enquiries** will be made for:

* Huntelaar
 * Not young, but has the mobility, can poach and more importantly is proven that he can play with Suarez. Coming towards the end of his contract and Ive personally been told its pretty much a done deal. Is NOT a valid long term option but may be what we need for a few seasons until we bring a player in.
* Walcott
 * Fans are divided, a lot are judging him based on his performance at Arsenal, they think hes all speed and no finish. I believe he's built for the Tika Taka system and he could be exactly what were looking for. Also coming to the end of his contract, high wages, semi high risk but could be exactly what were looking for. Plus he's a fan which can always help in negotiations. 
* Sturridge
 * BR seems to like him, we were in negotiations with him last window but we couldnt agree on a price. He is a good player and he's clearly fed up with lack of chances at Chelsea and wants first team football, but with Falcoa coming in all signs point to him leaving. Chelsea will hold out for big price because its us but his insistence to leave may aid us.
* Hooper
 * I personally dont want him, he's got an good scoring record..in the SPL which isnt very exciting (no offence). Would be an insult to pay more than 5 for him, would only see him as a sub at best. 
* Damião
 * we tried to get him on loan but came in too late in the TW to finish negotiations, was big interest on both sides. Expect to pay 18-20m if we want him, maybe even a loan to purchase deal. Very exciting player, very pass oriented striker already and plays like a young Torres. BUT a gamble, Brazilian league isnt the best for rating players, some players shine out there and cant handle the pace of another league.

Less likely but still possible enquiries for:

* Tello 
 * failed to find a place at Barca, I hear we were in talks last window but he wanted to sign a one year extension to try and break into the team, Neymar is now on his way in meaning his chances are even slimmer, may abandon ship
* Torres 
 * If you think he's lost more than 5% of his ability after one and a half bad seasons at chelsea then you need to get off fifa. Chelsea never used him right and while we all know we have the key (Gerrard) to his goal scoring Engine a few fans dont want his goal scoring capabilities because of his comments.. Sticks and stones. MAY be used in Falcao negotiations but may want to stay in England, we would likely be favourites if we can match what they want, BR's call though.

I guess I'd say I'm still on board, but worried -- much like season 3 of Community, there seems to be a real danger that the very smart, very talented showrunner will get lost in his own strange world and take the show down these odd corridors that the audience is not prepared to experience, or in Moffat's case, lose people in a labyrinthine plot (one thinks of LOST, or season two of Veronica Mars). But there is certainly hope; as I said, I loved s5, loved it, so IMO there's still plenty of silver screen magic to be had.

Instead of hints that lead up to the finale (like with Bad Wolf [s01], Torchwood [s02], Harold Saxon [s03], planets disappearing [s04]), it's just being shoved in our face. Everyone was speculating that River was Amy &amp; Rory's daughter because it was pretty obvious.  

I like to have those little hints that are impossible to figure out, leading up to an amazing finale.  Moffat is *all about* the companion.  He's not writing Doctor Who, he's writing The Doctor's Companion.  Davies wrote about the Doctor and gracefully incorporated aspects of the companions in there.

The few episodes of season 5 I enjoyed were basically through the Weeping Angels 2-parter.  After that it was the Amy Pond Show, feat. Rory.

Are the suits in charge really thinking of the Chelsea to be, 2-4 years from now?  Can our present season just be shuffled under the carpet as another ""transition"" season, if it doesn't result in any trophies?

Didn't our reserves recently turn into a U21 squad?  That seems to signal to me a giant change in direction for the club..

I agree that we have a bit of a problem with depth right now..  But say we buy a striker - what message does that send to Sturridge and Lukaku?  I think the powers that be might be treading cautiously for that reason.

Say we buy a 25 year old central midfielder..   Maybe we don't realy want to do that, because given enough time, we want that slot available for our youngsters - Romeu or McEachran , or whoever.  Maybe that's our new strategy - buy young and develop.

So the **World Trade Center** and **Pentagon** weren't a financial ""centre"" nor a military target?

&gt; and civilians being hit in the cross fire

So the Hiroshima deaths were just caught in the cross fire?

&gt; Some of us believe in loyalty to our friends

""They"" are not your ""friends"", you do realise US companies are some of the worst tax dodgers in the world? But I digress—your argument was about ""defending us"" (not ""US"") and you cited an American example. That's quite a non sequitur. Talking of friends, we had some in Bengal (1943) and we contributed directly and passively to the deaths of up to 4 million people through starvation. 

&gt; However you are perfectly happy to defend terrorists who intentionally kill as many civilians as possible, for absolutely no purpose other than to show how ‘powerful’ they are.

Now that description fits exactly with what Hiroshima was about, and they did it twice remember? It was to kill as many civilians as possible **despite** condemnation from many people of power including the military and even Churchill:

&gt; Winston Churchill later asserted: ""It would be a mistake to suppose that the fate of Japan was settled by the atomic bomb. Her defeat was certain before the bomb fell.""

It is accepted scholarly thought that the real reason was to put the fear of god into the Soviets and make them back out of the pacific. It's also a great implicit card to play at the negotiation table when they started dividing up the spoils of war. The Soviets had up to the Berlin wall, and the US was free to invade the Pacific and Latin America, committing all manner of clandestine and direct atrocities, which continue today in places like Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. 

It is moronic to believe that the whole Iraqi and Afghan population was conspiring to attack America, or as you see it ""us"", and therefore they posed a legitimate threat and deserved all the droney goodness, tortures and birth defects thereafter. Just like the WMDs in Iraq none of Rumsfeld's [super villain terror caves](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGhGHxw0mSo) have turned up either. ""We"" didn't enter to save woman or for human rights, but were there to kill the ""terrorist"" threat, ie subjugate and murder the general population.

China doesn't tend to favor military intervention in general. I don't see how either nation would be willing to go to war with Europe/the US over an aggressive peacekeeping mission, only that Russia would lose some influence if the new Syrian government was pro or neutral to the west. It's also worth noting that both Russia and China conduct similar actions against parts of their own nations (such as the Caucasus - read up on Chechnya, or in Chinas case Tibet), so they could hardly back rebel forces when they have dealt so harshly with rebels in their own territory. Doing so would give separatist movements more legitimacy which is again something neither want.

As for specofdusts comments, technically he is correct. China and Russia could do nothing to prevent it as they don't have the soft or hard power capabilities. They present no military threat. The fallout would depend on what the goal was, Russia wouldn't want to lose influence in Syria and would be unhappy with a western leaning government or a pro-democratic Arab state.

Its very important to remember that..

**Torres will, more than likely be favouring a LFC return.**

**Reasons to stay in England or go:**

He's said before he loves it in England, he said he loves the prem, its speed, its excitement and I bet he will want to stay here to continue to prove himself on the big stage. 

He loves Gerrard and Gerrard loves him. These two almost and there beautiful chemistry and teamwork almost won us the prem. Whether or not he asks Gerrard to put in the good word with BR or Gerrard sweet talks him to return there always a possibility.

As a bonus he's repeatedly pissed off Chelsea fans by praising us and he's kept his house in Liverpool so no problems getting him settled in.

**Chelsea and Falcao:**

Deals go both ways. I know some are saying (and I've even said) that Chelsea will probably try and use him in an exchange for Falcao but he may not agree to it, remember **he will more than likely get a say** regardless of what Chelsea want and his input could sour this arrangement. Also, although AM may be his childhood club he may want to stay in England and in the prem and to return to the club that made him a super star. 

**Why not another English club?**

Same risk with Chelsea. He cant afford to go and under perform, he's looking to to hit top form again and probably also knows he may not get another chance after that to do so again. He know while there may be a few here that cant let the past go the majority will welcome him back and worship him.

**Money, Money, Money:**

Chelsea wont sell him cheap, but they have to keep in mind they really dont want him on the pay role (even if they can afford it) and an unhappy player is a pain in the ass so odds are they'll be looking to shift him asap. Id guarantee Chelsea wont let him go for less than 23m. wages? your looking around 100,000 a week and thats with a pay cut and believe me he'll take it if he wants to get out of Chelsea. Why would Chelsea sell to there rivals? same reason they sold him to us, because they know we'd be very interested and more importantly pay (and its always good to keep transfer negotiations open with a rival for future deals).

**Worth the risk?**

Yes. I dont say this because Im a big fan of Torres, I say this because Im a bigger fan of LFC. 

It may be a gamble for most teams especially at that price but he's already a proven super star here, his ability never changed, the chelsea team, system and role was a ugly change and because Chelsea never played him to his strengths he scored but on a much less impressive scale. Him and Gerrard together were phenomenal, but imagine Gerrard in the centre slinging cutting passes and Suarez carrying the ball over distance, Torres up front will be in wonderland. 

**What about the fans?:**

We've all made mistakes. we've all done and said stupid shit. He thought he was doing the right thing but clearly was wrong, in my eyes if he rejoined us now he would be a Liverpool player, wearing red and all would be forgiven because when your a liverpool player you never walk alone. 

It's BR's call and Ive given my honest and as far as I know, truthful opinion on what may be going through his mind.

I know BR likes to know his options and should this Torres for sale become official or atleast privately official he may chose to act on it.

They aren't even allowed to report the news! The cheerleading around various wars, austerity, and the Jubilee were particularly vile, but they've suffered an absenteeism in just about every area possible (NHS privatisation, true cost of war, expenses, pedos, NOTW, etc). I can't think of any ground breaking programming or news story that came out of the BBC. I suppose there's always hawking various wares to US television. It's clear they are a tool of information management, they replaced the Ministry in that regard. They have well and truly primed the UK population with the myth that the FSA are noble rebels, just in time for the fetishised Remembrance day, and on the day after news is released that ""our noble troops"" will be sent into Syria.

true,nachoiskerka,mcgann,McGann,"Ultimately there are 5 best points to start from:(in chronological order)

1.An Unearthly Child-Watch episode 1 and then skip to ""The Daleks"". Episode 1 is a great at weaving the mysteries of the doctor. The rest of the tale's kind of crap until the climax where you kind of realize why the doctor NEEDS companions. That's about it

2.The Spearhead from Space-A Robert Holmes Masterpiece, though to be fair it really doesn't pick up until episode 2. In the mean time all the mysteries of the doctor are brought to the front quite readily, as this episode was used to bring in new viewers during the switch to color.Arguably if you're dead set on starting with rose(2005 reboot), then I'd suggest starting here. Rose basically rips the plot while having less the explanation of the rest of it and the execution is rubbish by comparison. Yes, a 1970's story trumps a 2005 story.

3.Doctor Who(1996)-Plausibly the most dividing piece of doctor who ever. Most people tend to watch this first or last. To be fair, the things this movie does everything right when establishing the doctor. Many of the current cues of the new TV series are ripped from right here, and to be honest the references to the time war later in the series are downright confusing without Paul McGann's face in the mix, as it's really weird to think ""A time war broke someone like tom baker"" for a mental image when compared to the adventurous cuckoo-clock of Paul McGann. Also, it helps that coming off this there's the largest amount of stories available for any doctor, if you're willing to dig at all.

4.Rose-Personally, I HATE Rose as an episode. Very little time is spent with the doctor, and a bunch of side characters who won't really matter for the rest of the season get a bunch of time. The villain isn't very scary, and everyone runs around really stupid-like. Rose is introduced and so is the new doctor(at a snail's pace), but the constant cuts, the attempts to fit too much in too quickly, and worst of all the ripped plot that doesn't do the bad guy any justice because of the way the episode was directed just annoy me so much. Luckily the VERY NEXT episode is fantastic,  but I think people have too much nostalgia when they think about this one...

5.The Eleventh Hour-To be fair, in a functional manner with today's discussions, this is one of the best places to start. The episodes all go down easy, the doctor's introduction benefits from extended run time, and most of all, the story flows so well because it FOLLOWS THE DOCTOR.

We wouldn't need to make any major changes whatsoever to fit carroll in. We're playing a game where we put lots of crosses in and the ball gets played across goal so so much. But, for some reason, there's nobody to get on the end of it or to recover the ball.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The Syrian National Councils leader is a plant from the Neo-Cons and the usual movers and shakers from the likes of the US and UK. A lot of the opposition has been funded by these people before any Arab spring.

The most senior of the SNC's official spokespeople is the Paris-based Syrian academic Bassma Kodmani.


Kodmani is a member of the executive bureau and head of foreign affairs, Syrian National Council. Kodmani is close to the centre of the SNC power structure, and one of the council's most vocal spokespeople. ""No dialogue with the ruling regime is possible. We can only discuss how to move on to a different political system,"" she declared this week. And here she is, quoted by the newswire AFP: ""The next step needs to be a resolution under Chapter VII, which allows for the use of all legitimate means, coercive means, embargo on arms, as well as the use of force to oblige the regime to comply.""

This statement translates into the headline ""Syrians call for armed peacekeepers"" (Australia's Herald Sun). When large-scale international military action is being called for, it seems only reasonable to ask: who exactly is calling for it? We can say, simply, ""an official SNC spokesperson,"" or we can look a little closer.

This year was Kodmani's second Bilderberg. At the 2008 conference, Kodmani was listed as French; by 2012, her Frenchness had fallen away and she was listed simply as ""international"" – her homeland had become the world of international relations.

Back a few years, in 2005, Kodmani was working for the Ford Foundation in Cairo, where she was director of their governance and international co-operation programme. The Ford Foundation is a vast organisation, headquartered in New York, and Kodmani was already fairly senior. But she was about to jump up a league.

Around this time, in February 2005, US-Syrian relations collapsed, and President Bush recalled his ambassador from Damascus. A lot of opposition projects date from this period. ""The US money for Syrian opposition figures began flowing under President George W Bush after he effectively froze political ties with Damascus in 2005,"" says the Washington Post.

In September 2005, Kodmani was made the executive director of the Arab Reform Initiative (ARI) – a research programme initiated by the powerful US lobby group, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).

The CFR is an elite US foreign policy thinktank, and the Arab Reform Initiative is described on its website as a ""CFR Project"" . More specifically, the ARI was initiated by a group within the CFR called the ""US/Middle East Project"" – a body of senior diplomats, intelligence officers and financiers, the stated aim of which is to undertake regional ""policy analysis"" in order ""to prevent conflict and promote stability"". The US/Middle East Project pursues these goals under the guidance of an international board chaired by General (Ret.) Brent Scowcroft.

Brent Scowcroft (chairman emeritus) is a former national security adviser to the US president – he took over the role from Henry Kissinger. Sitting alongside Scowcroft of the international board is his fellow geo-strategist, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who succeeded him as the national security adviser, and Peter Sutherland, the chairman of Goldman Sachs International. So, as early as 2005, we've got a senior wing of the western intelligence/banking establishment selecting Kodmani to run a Middle East research project. In September of that year, Kodmani was made full-time director of the programme. Earlier in 2005, the CFR assigned ""financial oversight"" of the project to the Centre for European Reform (CER). In come the British.

The CER is overseen by Lord Kerr, the deputy chairman of Royal Dutch Shell. Kerr is a former head of the diplomatic service and is a senior adviser at Chatham House (a thinktank showcasing the best brains of the British diplomatic establishment).

In charge of the CER on a day-to-day basis is Charles Grant, former defence editor of the Economist, and these days a member of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a ""pan-European thinktank"" packed with diplomats, industrialists, professors and prime ministers. On its list of members you'll find the name: ""Bassma Kodmani (France/Syria) – Executive Director, Arab Reform Initiative"".

Another name on the list: George Soros – the financier whose non-profit ""Open Society Foundations"" is a primary funding source of the ECFR. At this level, the worlds of banking, diplomacy, industry, intelligence and the various policy institutes and foundations all mesh together, and there, in the middle of it all, is Kodmani.

The point is, Kodmani is not some random ""pro-democracy activist"" who happens to have found herself in front of a microphone. She has impeccable international diplomacy credentials: she holds the position of research director at the Académie Diplomatique Internationale – ""an independent and neutral institution dedicated to promoting modern diplomacy"". The Académie is headed by Jean-Claude Cousseran, a former head of the DGSE – the French foreign intelligence service.

A picture is emerging of Kodmani as a trusted lieutenant of the Anglo-American democracy-promotion industry. Her ""province of origin"" (according to the SNC website) is Damascus, but she has close and long-standing professional relationships with precisely those powers she's calling upon to intervene in Syria.

And many of her spokesmen colleagues are equally well-connected.


Outside interference and I wonder if the Syrian National Council will be the ones who elect the next Syrian leader when Assad is ousted?

I hate to say it, but there is a massive hand steering things in Syria and the goal is to remove Assad for reasons different from wanting to stop people being killed.

The justification for the ""inevitable"" military intervention is the savagery of President Assad's regime: the atrocities, the shelling, the human rights abuses. Information is crucial here, and one source above all has been providing us with data about Syria. It is quoted at every turn: ""The head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told VOA [Voice of America] that fighting and shelling killed at least 12 people in Homs province.""

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights is commonly used as a standalone source for news and statistics. Just this week, news agency AFP carried this story: ""Syrian forces pounded Aleppo and Deir Ezzor provinces as at least 35 people were killed on Sunday across the country, among them 17 civilians, a watchdog reported."" Various atrocities and casualty numbers are listed, all from a single source: ""Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP by phone.""

Statistic after horrific statistic pours from ""the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights"" (AP). It's hard to find a news report about Syria that doesn't cite them. But who are they? ""They"" are Rami Abdulrahman (or Rami Abdel Rahman), who lives in Coventry.

According to a Reuters report in December of last year: ""When he isn't fielding calls from international media, Abdulrahman is a few minutes down the road at his clothes shop, which he runs with his wife.""

When the Guardian's Middle East live blog cited ""Rami Abdul-Rahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights"" it also linked to a sceptical article in the Modern Tokyo Times – an article which suggested news outlets could be a bit ""more objective about their sources"" when quoting ""this so-called entity"", the SOHR.

That name, the ""Syrian Observatory of Human Rights"", sound so grand, so unimpeachable, so objective. And yet when Abdulrahman and his ""Britain-based NGO"" (AFP/NOW Lebanon) are the sole source for so many news stories about such an important subject, it would seem reasonable to submit this body to a little more scrutiny than it's had to date.

The Observatory is by no means the only Syrian news source to be quoted freely with little or no scrutiny …

&gt;He was in the BBC studios during Jimmy Savile's heyday, and is widely thought to be a High Priest of Satanism, his story keeps changing insofar as he says in one place, he was unaware of any distasteful allegations against S until 1997 or 1998.

GK: We would actually be better off getting a decent backup. Courtois does not fit here because he's only a starter, same with Cech. Maybe Blackman in a few years, but I get nervous as fuck if we have to turn to Turnbull.

----

LB/CB: We're good here.

RB: I think we're good here too. City have more depth but Maicon is pretty shit. Ivan is comparable to either starter, and while Azpi isn't quite up to par with the backups, we bought him in part for his potential. His play now is good and will steadily improve. Not too worried  about this position with Ivanovic there.

We'd honestly be better with another *young* central defender or two, like Hutch and maybe Bruma.

----

Midfield: Too thin. Bring in another Ramires type midfielder. I don't fancy the Oscar/KdB mold for this position because I think Ramires-type midfielders will be more useful, whereas Oscar would be nice against lower teams.

**TLDR:** Lazy, selfish aunt left us stranded in London police station when trains/buses stopped for the night. 

When I was 10 my family went to England to visit my aunt and her husband, we had gone to France for the day, and found out the hard way that the trains don't run past 11. My aunt from Shefford Bedfordshire wouldn't come pick us up because they were ""too tired,"" even though it was my mom's birthday.

 The only places that were open were the pubs (for a few more hours) and the police station. So us 4 girls spent the night piled onto a marble bench in the police station lobby while my parents tried (unsuccessfully) to call cabs to take us back to my aunt's house.

In the morning, we scurried over to the train station to wait for my uncle to meet us to help us back to their house. He said he'd be there at 9am, didn't get there till 11. We tried sitting in the McDonald's because there were no benches in the station, but the owner/manager/whatever shoo'ed us out and called us 'hussies.'

true,Real_Rodriguez,null,null,"I don't think finances would be too much of an issue. It really comes down to BR and if he thinks he can use him, because if Rodgers doesn't think he can be useful he won't come at all.
Torres spearheaded a rampant Spanish NT through two major tournaments, he's not as effective as say Villa in that squad but he is sufficiently comfortable with the pass and move system BR wants to implement.

As far as finances go, Torres would have to go into the first team (assuming he does come I don't see him being bought to occupy the bench) Which means one of our midfielders would have to be cut. Allen and Lucas are sure ins, the last being occupied by Gerrard for the time being.

That leaves Sahin/Shelvey on the bench (for the short term) and since we don't own Sahin its plausible we'd elect not to purchase him, if Carroll does go and bring in 15-17m, we'd have approx 27m to fund a Torres move, i'm assuming the wages from those two would go some way to making Torres affordable as well.

true,acuteindifference,1905,Super Frank,"* Our defense could use some work.

* We need better rotation. If one or more of Hazard, Mata and Oscar get injured/suspended, we are completely and utterly fucked. Its already been clear how dependent on Mata we are. And its scary. RDM needs to be using the subs more efficiently and using the last 10-15 mins (atleast) to give some squad players some game time. 

* RDM does not have a plan B. Other than throwing on Moses and hoping for the best. 

* Our transition from defence to attack is terrible. We need a good passer in the deep midfield, someone who can control the game. My vote goes to start playing Oscar a bit deeper and get Moses, Marin and Piazon more time in the attacking positions. 

* For all of our possession and pretty passing game this season, we haven't actually scored a lot of goals by breaking down teams with our attack. Most of our goals have been on counter attacks and set plays. We are too narrow in our build-up play. We need to improve things. Another reason I think Marin should get regular game time. He's a dribbler, he's direct and he goes past people. We need that.

* We need to be more clinical with the chances we get. I'm a huge Torres fan but I'm sick of trying to convince myself after every game that he's still got it, he showed some glimpses today, he'll be back to his best very soon. He makes two or three amazing runs every game, doesn't get the ball and then gets frustrated. Once he's frustrated, he gets into wrong positions, instead of making runs towards the goal, he starts making runs away from the goal, getting himself into positions from where it is almost impossible to score. Other times he'll drop back, get a pass and try to beat three or four defenders at the same time and lose the ball. He needs to perform better. Yes, he's scored 6 goals this season, but anyone watching our games can clearly see that he should have had so many more.

* I know you guys are huge fans of Mikel here and he's significantly improved during the past year. But he still has a long way to go. He has a very small passing range, an average shot and he cannot dribble. He's not known for making crunching tackles and bullying people in midfield either, so in my humble opinion, he does not bring a lot to the team.

* We miss Lamps a lot. If anything, he's a more than decent squad player to have and we could use the rest for Ramires.

* Our treatment of Malouda has been really pathetic in my opinion. He's no Messi, but he's been at the club for years, he's always worked hard, given his all for the team and this is no way to treat a team member.

I wish we had him still, and played him in some games just to see. He would be more effective then Yesil or Morgan and possibly Borini. Also, I feel like you guys are just saying that he wouldn't fit the system without any reason. I personally tthink he has great footwork, can shoot from outside (which is required in our style), and he can get a head on the many many crosses that we throw in there. Seriously, I feel like our new style has TONS of crossing because our best attacking comes when we can draw in the defenders, and dish it out to the wide open wing (that ""one more"" pass). We cross all the time, andy is better with his feet and movement then you all give him credit for. I wish we kept him, used him, and decided what to do with him in January. I bet he would have added to our goal tally, and Suarez would be playing on a wing!

Yet that isn't even a question of that, it would be much simpler and less of a thorny moral issue to have to deal with if it was. Truth is we as a nation we are committed to human rights and the funny thing about human rights is that every human no matter how repugnant gets them. This is the system stopping a man being forced out the country at the whim of the government to stand trail in a place where evidence gained under torture maybe used against him.

I'm damn proud to live in a country where a law like that exists and I'm even more proud that it exists in the face of the outrage of people because it's protecting a man we don't like. 

This maybe a personal victory for Qatada but if we over rule these laws that protect us in special cases where they are inconvenient then we have done more to harm out nation that Qatada could have ever done other wise.

Check your outrage at the door and *think* about what this represents in the abstract and what you are calling for when you are calling to give government power to ignore the questions of some ones human rights.

Why would he leave something he left Liverpool for? He left to be in contention for silverware. 
hat's what is happening for him at Chelsea. It's horrible to think but why would he take a step down?
If anything, he would want to rejoin the club he really loves, his boyhood club, where he is adored regardless. Atletico.
And lets face it, Atletico have more chance at the minute of winning honours than us.

Torres wouldn't want to leave Chelsea whilst they are competing. 

Chelsea won't let Torres go for cheap. 

The only team Torres would leave Chelsea for if pushed would be Atletico (or Barce, but they won't have him).

Chelsea want Falcao. 

If Atletico were to let Falcao go it would be reluctantly and Torres could be the sweetener.

It has to work for all parties and Torres back to us would just be a dumb move on his part. I love Liverpool but this is just realism.

**EDIT** Ok, I've been thinking more about this. Maybe he would come back.

He isn't getting the support from the fans like he had at Liverpool.

He said last week his best form and when he was happiest was at Liverpool.

He has won the Champs league and FA cup with Chelsea. Maybe that is enough for him to consider coming back. He knows deep down he would have to work hard to get our respect back, but if he was committed and worked hard, we would acknowledge this and forgive him.

He still has a chance to become a legend, this will not happen at Chelsea.

He loves Merseyside, he loved living there and lets face it, the Wirral almost has its own micro climate ;)

His kids are LFC fans, he always said he wants them to grow up as scousers.

IF, that's a big IF, this was to happen, it needs to happen in January.

Big questions is if we have the funds for him. And whether Rodgers would prefer Huntelaar. 

Who knows, we need a goal poacher though, desperately.

**EDIT 2** I can't stop thinking about it now. I'd love for a Torres/Suarez partnership BUT is Torres good enough anymore?

Would he refind his form with the knowledge that he is at a club that would forgive him and grow to really love him again. The buzz off seeing the KOP bouncing. 
He is a massive confidence player, I think he would get it back knowing the whole crowd is there behind him.

He has lost his pace, his first touch has never been spectacular, trying to go past players he looks like he hasn't got proper control over the ball.
