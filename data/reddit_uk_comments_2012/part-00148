true,JakeSanchard,null,null,"Being on the dole isn't bad at all. I graduated from University of Huddersfield in July and I've been in dole for about 3 months now.

The people who work at the job centre are actually very helpful. They give you so much information on where to go to get a job, how to search for what you want. I had an interview earlier today and they referred me to a volunteering group in my area and also gave me a few good tips on improving my CV.

You will be given an agreement. Mine is to apply for 3 jobs a week from the job centre website and apply for 1 from the local paper. What usually happens is the employer will list their email address or phone number and you'll either send them an email with your written application and a CV attached, or you'll ring the number and ask them the details of the job and they'll send you an application form. Email tends to be the most favoured method of contact for employers so make sure you have a professional email address (avoid anything like dancing_penguin67@gmail.com. I use Fastmail. It's free, and looks professional and it really helps keep your mind focused on job hunting.

Yes, aptitude tests and phone interviews count as doing something to look for work. You wouldn't be given them if you didn't contact the employer in the first place.

Your first interview will basically be about you. What do you want to do? How far are you willing to travel? How's your CV? When can you start working? Max hours per week? etc. They tend to ask you for three generic job titles that you will be applying for. They don't technically force you to work but if you turn down an offer than they can dock your dole or kick you off it entirely. However, since they only recommend jobs that you've told them you would prefer, this shouldn't be an issue. You have reasonable grounds to decline a job position if it's completely unrelated to what your 3 choices are. For example, they gave me 2 job applications for Support Worker which is great because a. They give you applications that haven't been listed on the job centre yet and b. Support Worker is my preferred choice out of that and my other two choices. If they gave me job applications for HGV driver or night DJ at a club then it would be fine for me to decline these since this isn't what I'm looking for/qualified to do.

Now, since you are graduate, you will likely be referred to a Graduate presentation. This will be something like a 30 minute talk on what graduates can do to get work. There's tonnes and trust me, it's well worth going if you get the offer.


Keep in mind that if you do get a menial job that is unrelated to your qualifications, you can still keep looking for other jobs and resign once you get accepted to somewhere more suitable. Most job applications actually assume you are in work and will ask you how much notice you need to give so that you can make the move as securely as possible.

There's probably something I've missed so if you want more info then please ask or drop me a message and I'll get back to you tomorrow! Hope I've helped in some way.",0,1351211063,null,0,false,0,c6rtxac,t3_123b8z,t1_c6rtxac,t3_123b8z,null,1430240653,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

To clear up a few points I made. When I finished my degree I still had open opportunities and interviews with a number of positions  that I had applied for. Looking for other jobs was not a priority when I had relevant interviews to prepare for. The last of these interviews ended in mid september, around the same time graduate schemes started opening up again for applications. Looking for other jobs had been the last thing on my mind til now. I was always thinking of applying to jobs that were in my field to get that much needed experience.

The reason I didn't do a placement are as follows: firstly I applied for placements during second year as opposed to third year (stupid I know), and had a few interviews, but didn't manage to get any. I spent most of my 3rd year being a depressed piece of shit and thinking my course was shit and wanting to study something completely different as a postgrad. By the end of 3rd year I realized I actually liked the course and by then I couldn't find any placements.

To be clear, there's no gap in my CV as since graduating I currently do have voluntary work on my CV and it is in my field. It's ongoing but it is more of a research than a hands-on role, which is why I'm looking for experience (in the hands on aspect - which is lacking). The hours aren't concrete though as I can choose my own. I'm also regularly doing voluntary charity work as I have links with some of the local charities and they are always happy for me to help.

I'll pass on the CV offer for now as I've given it to someone who's a careers advisor to have a look at. When that comes back, and I still don't have any luck I'll try to PM you.

/end rant.

About the game.  Walker looked like he has all season, not confident and I sort of hope he doesn't get a pass because I know he'll just fuck it up.  I hope his form picks up or else I hope we start looking into our reserves/youth for a right back to fill in.  

I've said it before and I'll say it again.  Defoe just is not very good at a lone striker position.  Our real danger comes from the flanks and what good is danger on the flanks if the opponents know the ball is going to be drilled in because we have a 4 foot tall striker in the box.  I think the right option would have been to start clint and defoe up top, or siggy and adebayor.  I don't think Sig and Defoe play very well together, but that could be my gut reaction.

I love sandro.  While he was not at the top of his game, I love his determination and his attitude.  When he was attacking he looked good, he has good ability to hold up the ball, but occasionally fucks up an easy pass... but I will let that slide as he does a great job tracking back and attacking.

T.hud was actually, in my opinion, one of the better players out there for me.  He wasn't creating like many have pointed out, but he was passing.  He was getting the ball around and also coming way deep to grab the ball and spread the ball out to either flank.  Sure some of his long passes were not long enough, but as someone else pointed out his completed pass ratio was pretty damn respectable.  He is a pretty shit defender though, but I suppose that is not really why he was on the pitch.

All in all, I think a draw was a fair result given how piss poor our play was in the final third.  I do think that Naughton should have had a penalty (but I am biased).  I do think the ref was a little unfair to us in other areas as well (again, biased).  I also believe that Maribor played pretty dirty in the first half but straightened themselves up in the second.  I was pretty livid with the diving, rolling around and theatrical bullshit, but like I said, it got better.

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"Thats exactly in line with the sentencing guidelines.

They have a much lower starting point because the crimes were committed as minors- all those who were convicted of the murder charge were 17.

The starting point for murder by an adult is 15 years, and where a weapon was brought to the scene its 25 years. The minimum term for someone under 18 is 12 years.

 Then there are aggravating factors. Starting with 12 years, there is the presence of a weapon, the level of planning, the age and vulnerability of the victim. Those get us to 18 years.

30 year+ sentences are very rare, and with a particular set of aggravating factors. For those under 18 they are virtually unheard off (on the other of abduction and murder of a child for sexual purposes, or multiple murders with aggravating features)

You can read about it here http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/murder/

Being a bit glib about it, essentially it *is* because you're american, but I don't mean that in a harsh way. Sentences, and the use of jail just happens to be considerably lower here than in the US (per capita the prison population is a fifth of the size) so, you will be used to hearing much longer sentences in the news. Many people in the UK dislike this, it must be noted, and would prefer a more punitive system, so you are certainly not alone.

Given the age of the aggressors, I can accept the length of the murder sentences. Equally, however, I can sympathise with those who want much longer sentences, especially given the cruelty involved in this. This wasn't some gangland fight that went wrong. This was a slaughter.

The manslaughter sentences I am less comfortable with, especially as they will be eligible for release at the halfway point, HOWEVER the jury could have convicted them of murder and wasn't able too (although its clear the juries were split on that point).  Such is the nature of trial by jury.

Please keep in mind that I don't really make minimalist art, so my feedback may be irrelevant.


It's really easy to get obsessive with details, I understand. Highly detailed artwork is fun and impressive, but I find that it often works really well if you have some areas of high detail, and some areas that are almost void of detail. Perhaps in the future if you know you're going to get obsessive with details, plan the composition in such a way that you can have some areas of intentional low detail. Particularly if you want to include text, because then you can just chuck the text onto an empty area and not detract from the detailed areas. Just a thought!


Point taken on the poster. However, I don't find that my eye naturally moves through the composition. The composition is basically three rectangles - the wall, the poster, the floor, with a fairly rectangular hand thrown in. If there was some other element, some sort of detail or a curve/vertical line, it might help to lead the viewer's eye from the poster down to the hand. Just off the top of my head, maybe the scene is lit dramatically and there is a shadow cast on the floor that angles toward the hand. Or maybe there is some detail on the wallpaper that leads the eye that way. Sometimes it's nice to throw something else in that leads the eye from the hand, back to the poster, keeping the eye moving throughout the piece. Right now, what I find happens is I look at the poster, then eventually I look down to the hand, and then the triangular shadow leads my eye out of the frame. The composition on ""Rose"" does a really nice job of this, so it's distinctly possibly that you already know exactly what you're doing here :)


And oh my god, I can't believe I just typed that much. This is why you never encourage someone with a degree in fine arts/art history to give you feedback. It's also why I shouldn't leave comments when I'm tired. 


I apologize if any of that sounded rude or condescending, that was certainly not my intention. It's obvious from your posters that you're quite talented, so I wouldn't be surprised if I'm just telling you things you already know/have considered. 

Once again, great job on these! I'm really surprised that you haven't gotten a ton of upvotes. I also understand if you would like to rescind your prior request for me to comment on your future work!

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"Very much so. I suspect the sentences would have been 28/29 years had those convicted of murder been adults.

Had it been one person acting alone I suspect they would have been the same.

What the presence of the mob does, is it spreads guilt across the members. The number of convictions is due to joint enterprise- merely by participating in the group that chased the victim resulted in a manslaughter conviction as a minimum, even if they didn't land a blow.

This is a slightly problematic law, as it massively lowers the standard of reasonable doubt to the jury coming to a subjective judgement about whether or not the accused ""had reason to believe"" the main person commiting the crime would act as he did/carry a knife. So some juries will convict on tenuous evidence, and others will refuse to to, where they should.

In this case a lot of the juries reached manslaughter convictions, but were deadlocked on imposing a murder conviction- the oldest in the group, a girl, who was a major ringleader, escaped a murder conviction, despite kicking the boys dying body as she left the scene, and received 12 years for manslaughter.

Its worth noting the murder convictions are much, much longer, as they are life sentences, with minimum terms- they will serve at least 18 years, and only then MAY get paroled.

The manslaughter convicts will be eligible for early release after 6 years.

Utilitarianism: Killing this man does nothing but provide for net loss in society, if caught the murderers/assassins will be put behind bars resulting in loss of utility for society, second round effects for this will be the increased resources of keeping them imprisoned. Loss of wellbeing as well for his wife/children and friends as they have lost a friend.

Deontological: If you take this situation and apply it to its universal logical extreme; murdering anyone who you disagree with. Then imagine a world where that was commonplace the world would not function as there would be murders everyone, hence unethical.

Aristotlian Virtues: Murder and lack of empathy for others is a vice, and should be not be strived for. This breaks the law of averages as well, as if having a virtue of sociological awareness if considered to be a virtue then murdering in the name of this virtue is a massive extreme and leads to loss of virtuous life.

Loss of wellbeing as well for his wife/children and friends as they have lost a friend.

This is pretty weak, as it depends on the utilities and probabilities you assign.  Theoretically, it could be that a level of threat to boardroom level executives delivered net gains in terms of lower levels of exploitation globally.  It's unlikely, but a case could be made.  Along the same lines as the government should fear the people more than the people fear the government.  With government we (arguably) have a legitimate way of exercising power, albeit, it seems to tend towards one pound one vote as opposed to one person one vote.  That is definitely the case with the economic system and corporations though, here money is most definitely directly related to power, and the vast majority of people, particularly in developing countries, have no legitimate means of exercising control over the corporations which have the most profound effect over every moment of their waking lives - including power over life and death.

So even though he is innocent (simply by virtue of the fact he will not be tried, and is therefore not guilty be default), the fact he has been *accused* of the crime is enough to allow the extradition to take place, even if the CPS don't think he has a case to answer, or that the accusation is even correct.

I'm in exactly the same position as you. I finished uni in June with my civil engineering degree and now can't get a job anywhere. I have signed on just to get that little bit of money coming in as its better than nothing. I have to apply for 5 jobs a week but they can be from anywhere, my two most used sites are probably reed.co.uk and totaljobs.com same as you mentioned. Most weeks I don't apply for any jobs advertised by the job centre and it's fine although I recently found quite a few good jobs on there, you'd be surprised. Also if you are applying for menial work such as retail which I have been doing it's best to have a second cv WITHOUT your degree on it as someone mentioned earlier they'll see it and just think that you're gunna take off the first chance you get. I first signed on about 6 weeks ago so if you have any questions about the procsses feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer.

We don't need the Doctor to be relatable- that's why we have a companion.

If we only do a certain age/gender/ethnicity Doctor for the sake of being able to relate to them, then people will never learn how to relate to other ages/genders/ethnicities.

We have it to help pay for our local government (council).

It pays for the services they provide, your own council will have full details on their website and they'll send you a breakdown of what it pays for with the bill every year.

&gt; Why do some parts of the UK have it and others not?

The whole of the UK has a form of local government taxation, just in NI it's called Rates.

Is it?

It's probably not really fair, but what tax is? There is a benefit to help some people pay it.

I support the need for a tax to pay for a local government, but perhaps an income based system would be better. My own council tax bill share is £1,100 a year due to the value of my home.

If you find they are pressuring you, and you need to stall them a bit until you find an engineering job, then just apply for admin type jobs, do a reasonable application but not one that stands out. That way you shouldn't get an interview but you will keep them off your back until an engineering job does come up.

I ended up borrowing money from my family to tide me over, a situation I was fortunate to be in.  I now owe money to my family after being employed but have the regret that I didn't sign on.

This story probably doesn't help, but please strongly consider taking the money.  You'll be paying into it once employed, and it's there for people who are trying to find work.  You're entitled to it.

true,pbhj,uk,.,"I have a drink when I'm out. One.

One drink over a 2 hour meal time. Alcohol is metabolised quite quickly - a single unit is effectively nullified (without food) after 2 hours. Granted I drink gradually over the duration of the meal.

One drink in this study is about 0.6 pints of beer (12 US fl oz), so my intake is likely just over 2 drinks for a pint of speckled hen : http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa35.htm.

That's going to put me around the 20mg level at the end of the meal.

The NIAAA cite another paper

&gt;""50 mg% is the level at which deterioration of driving skills begins. (JAMA 255:522-527, 1986.)"" //

Which would mean that one drink will not impair driving for a normal male (females apparently are more affected).

So, I'm wondering if this is backed up by the science. TBH I'm not that bothered, ""no alcohol"" is a simple way to push a low consumption message.

As someone else mentioned driving tired appears to be a far greater impairment than a single drink; though I'll accept that alcohol probably skews the impression of how impaired one is. If I'm feeling tired or want to have more drinks then I'll agree in advance with my partner for them to drive or not go out.

Perhaps the law should focus on ability to drive safely rather than specifics of the persons situation - can you pass a reaction time test, read a distant sign, communicate effectively with the tester, walk a line, score normally on a hand-eye coordination test, parallel park??

true,johneth,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"To the people saying that the Licence Fee should be either abolished or made optional I say: you don't know what you're missing until it's gone.

The Licence Fee guarantees the BBC's independence from market forces, meaning it can make niche and specialist programming for smaller audiences which are high quality without worrying about the cost or return on investment other than audience appreciation (see: BBC Four, science and history programming on BBC One / Two, 6Music, specialist radio shows on Radio 1 / 1xtra / Radio 2 / all of Radio 3 / a lot of Radio 4, and a whole lot more).

It also allows them to concentrate on areas which would have too high commercial costs if it weren't funded by the Fee, such as the Natural History Unit's output (Frozen Planet, Life, Planet Earth, Human Planet, Blue Planet, etc. etc.).

It allows them to support and nurture unknown talent without worrying that they'll fail or not be successful first time round (BBC Introducing on the local and national radio networks as well as at festivals, various BBC 1/2/3/4 comedies and dramas, live music performances like Later...). A commercial BBC would not do this nearly so much.

It lets them provide a comprehensive global news service. News is expensive to do - Sky News for example does not make a profit (it's a prestige operation for Sky)

Without the Fee, it wouldn't be able to be supported, at it's current size, with adverts. There's a finite ad spend in the UK, which is shrinking for TV.  It would seriously damage not only the BBC, but other broadcasters, like ITV, Channel 4, etc. (not Sky so much, as they rely more on subscription revenue).

Like it or not, it's a unifying institution in the UK: for national events of significance, it's the place people go to - the royal wedding, jubilee stuff, the Olympics for recent examples. People can visit BBC studios, buildings, do lots of work experience there because it's a public institution. It's always been there.  Damaging it by removing the Licence Fee would probably damage life in the UK in unquantifiable ways, the most obvious of which would be reduced spending in the UK's creative industries simply because there wouldn't be as much money around. The creative industries, by the way, are one of the UK's major assets.  It allows the BBC to do all these high quality things, forcing other broadcasters to up their game.

Anyway, you can probably tell that I support the Licence Fee.

I think a fair package for comparison would be the cheapest pay TV package Sky offers; that's £21.50/month. Presumably, Sky have decided that £21.50 is the lowest price point that makes sense for TV; if they thought there was more profit in offering a cut-down cheaper package, they'd do so.

Having said that, I do think the BBC's funding needs reform; I would tie the licence fee purely to BBC reach, and permit the BBC to buy audience share from the commercial channels (by doing deals where the BBC pays the commercial broadcaster a fee of the commercial broadcaster's choice and in return gets to count the audience of that channel at certain times as part of the BBC audience) to achieve high reach. I [wrote this up a while ago in a bit more detail](http://blog.farnz.org.uk/2010/10/on-funding-bbc.html) - basically, though, I'd say that the BBC needs to continually increase reach to be permitted an above-inflation rise in income. Once the BBC has 100% reach (i.e. every person in the UK watches a BBC programme or listens to a BBC radio show), it's stuck at the same budget modulo inflation; if it loses reach, it finds its budget is reduced.

Basically, the BBC should have a strong incentive to be the broadcaster that provides something for everyone, and to fund niche programming; let commercial broadcasters chase big audiences, and let the BBC try to get everyone in the UK interested in its output.",0,1351244537,null,0,false,0,c6s04w0,t3_12434p,t1_c6s04w0,t1_c6rzth4,null,1430243651,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Firstly its worth mentioning that its not quite a year. Being aged 21 and under serves to mitigate 

Personally I'm actually fine with this. Primarily because the evidence is overwhelming that the human brain is miles away from being finished developing in teenagers. They are mentally lacking in all manner of capabilities to make good decisions and to control violence. They are wired to lack empathy and impulse control in a way they are not in a mere handful of years time.

Perhaps more to the point the person who commits a crime a crime at that age, is not the same person who will still be being punished in 20 years time. These are children, however horrible they may be, and in a decades time that child will be gone. That is not to say they will be a nice person, or indeed a safe person to release, but they will be a spectacularly *different* person. To a far greater extent than someone who commits a crime in their mid 20s. 

I do respect disagreement with this of course, and I do understand that it makes little difference to the victim or their family, but I do think it unrealistic, and neurologically unjustified to judge teenagers, particularly at 16 and 17 by the same standards as adults.

No, he done it of his own volition. He didn't send a company memo round afterwards telling everyone either. To assume there were a few people within the BBC who were aware of these allegations, at the very least, is fair. But to condemn the BBC as a whole because a handful of people didn't accuse him when they may not have had any evidence is absurd.

Jimmy Savillie was a huge star of the BBC and a much loved public figure - why would they sully his reputation without hard evidence? His fame and status was good for the BBC so maybe they didn't want to go and destroy that based on rumour? I'm not saying ""oh, he's on the tele so he can do whatever"" but having such a huge public image is not something so easily attacked - in fact, the only reason he's probably getting tore to pieces now is because he's dead so he can't make a defence. Nobody is going to defend a dead person accused of being a sex offender because there will never be any evidence to prove he is, but an influx of evidence to prove he was. When John Terry was found guilty for racism (I know this issue is no where near as serious as child molestation, but you get my drift) nobody was foaming at the mouth demanding the abolition of FIFA and The FA. Years ago when Cheryl Cole (Tweedy at the time) assaulted that woman in the nightclub, there wasn't a mass calling demanding the music industry be destroyed. I can guarantee there are people, most likely celebrities, possibly even ones you admire yourself, who have there own horrible dark secrets that because of their position and wealth you will never hear about until they die - if ever at all; even when the mass media finds out they can still seeks legal recourse to cover it up; I.e. injunctions.

I'm not saying its right to cover it up if they had solid evidence, but not announcing the to world that one if their stars is a pedophile hen all they have to go on is hearsay is a terrible move (if thy ha solid evidence then disregard me, I've not really kept up with this issue)

P.S. just because you personally may not watch BBC content doesn't make it redundant. The Beeb offers a lot of quality and varied programming which many people all across the world find enjoyable.

You do if there is public subsidy. For a greater cultural good. That is my point. Now admittedly, this is an entirely subjective viewpoint, but; I think that the world of the past century would have been a much shabbier place without the beeb. And I think the next century will be. 

The reason why I think it needs to be a tax on everyone is because most people do not think about things that way, because they are encouraged by the rest of the media not to (bit like the situation with the death penalty in this country). Look at the dire state of the rest of TV in this country. Look at the rubbish on ITV. This Savile story was pretty much the first piece of investigative journalism on there of any worth for years. And surprise surprise it was trashing the beeb..

Your logic is similar to that which prevents there from being universal healthcare in the US and that is killing the NHS in this country ""Why should I pay for others?""

The reason why is because, at its best, the BBC improves things even for those that do not indulge in any of its content at all. 

I appreciate that my viewpoint is an ideological one, but it is also a considered one. I think this is probably my final word on the issue for now.  ",0,1351246457,null,0,false,0,c6s0aoj,t3_12434p,t1_c6s0aoj,t1_c6s084j,null,1430243710,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2
true,erythro,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;compare to what, exactly? The BBC has, what, 5/6 tv channels and 8 radio which is where my TV license money goes.

Yep.  Now let's compare prices.  £145 per year, which comes to £12 a month.  This is ad free.

Sky is minimum £21 a month, which is only entertainment channels, supported by ads.  40 of them, admittedly.  But a few of those are not exclusive, like dave, and a lot of the rest are things like ""discovery, home and health"", ""discovery, travel and living"", ""sky living"", ""sky living it"" and so on.  I'd argue that a simple channel count isn't so significant.  This doesn't include any HD, which the licence fee does.

This does not address the fact the sky gets some of the licence fee, and that the licence fee funded channels are also shown on sky.

&gt;And of course the biggest difference of all; I can cancel sky anytime I like. I can't even watch ITV 1 without a tv license. that's whats unfair about it. Even if I never watched the BBC, I'd still be paying for it.

I suppose I don't think that's that unfair.  There are advantages to a licence fee funded broadcasting service that are universal, whether you even watch the channels or not.  British audiences have a much lower tolerance level of adverts due to the BBC.  British news coverage in television and radio aspires to be more neutral in tone, due to the BBC.

Compare to the US, or the newspapers.  The most respected news coverage in broadcasted media is the BBC, so people want to be more like them, and that's better for everyone.

If you don't care about broadcasted media, fine!  Don't pay the fee.

The only ways to stop this way of doing things would be to cut funding to the bbc, raise prices for the bbc, or subject it to heavier corporate or government pressures.  

You don't complain that your taxes go to other things you don't use (I assume) - at least this way the ""tax"" of a licence fee is only for those who want to interact with broadcasted media.",0,1351246461,null,0,false,0,c6s0aou,t3_12434p,t1_c6s0aou,t1_c6rzth4,null,1430243710,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

That takes 22%ish of your whole income, and is an automatic tax code given to you as soon as you begin work for the first time, or applied afterwards if you work at a second job. You can contact the HMRC and claim this back and correct your tax code (I'd recommend doing this ASAP, you can go back three years).

You have an 'untouchable' minumum income, which is £8105 a year. (Incidentally, that's twice what Jobseeker's allowance is pw, so anyone's argument about being better off is bunk.) Your tax code is dependent on your total earnings, but will be calculated after this amount. Everyone pays National Insurance at a flat rate dependent on your whole earnings.

Obviously its up to you how much you weight this. But neurologically its a fact. The brains of teenagers are enormously underdeveloped compared with those just a few years older.

If you are looking either to judge how risky a person is, or how bad a person they are, then it is a fact that if a 25 year old commits a crime, and a 17 year old commits a crime, then the 25 year old is both higher risk, and also more worthy of blame. In ten years the brain of the 17 year old will be radically different

The extent to which this should be weighted is absolutely debatable.

But personally, as I said, I see no point in punishing someone in their late 40s who has virtually no connection to some vile 17 year old kid. It may serve a visceral sense of revenge, but I don't think it provides any benefit to society whatsoever.

true,Galerath,null,null,"&gt;Anarchism has always been met with militarism to reinstate fascism or monarchy.

Or to initially instate such a system. There will always be individuals who will seek power and they will inevitably through force of will or force of arms, rise to that power. Any system has to account for that, but Anarchism doesn't. That's why no system based on a lack of government will ever work - it assumes that tyranny comes from *without* and has an irrational faith in the good of individuals. Tyrants are of course individuals, and the will to power is a common one. You cannot change human nature.

Lets put it this way, if you overthrew the government tomorrow and tried to set up an anachrist, phisiocratic society, I'd be the first one to organize a militia, establish a government and start operating on a capitalist model again. Not because I'm a shill for a foreign power but because I believe adamantly that the alternative would be chaos, misery and famine, and I'd rather establish order and enforce my will than see that happen.

I very much doubt I'm alone in that too - there are plenty of individuals who'd quickly rush in to fill the power vacuum and rebuild the hierarchy. 

&gt;You have a poor understanding of what anarchism means.

And you have a poor understanding of Capitalism. So I guess we're equally ignorant. My understanding so far is you're advocating a sort of anachronism-sydicatism where people live in communes and farm the land without any wage system, government or established currency. Of course that may be a straw man but you consistently fail to make your position clear, instead you make obtuse allusions and then claim I don't understand you.

&gt;The greatest atrocities have been in the name of capitalism.

At the risk of invoking Godwin's Law, no, the Nazis did what they did in the name of racial purity. The Nazis were, as you may recall, National Socialists who ran a planned economy. In other words, a group of *Socialists* caused the holocaust due to their racism.

It would never be in the interests of a purely self-interested Capitalist to murder all the Jews. Why go to all that expense, when all you're doing is eliminating potential customers? All it's going to do is make people hate you, which is bad for business. Only irrational hatred in the form of nationalism and racism can produce a genocide. 

&gt;It demands that a capitalist colonises the working class. Just as an imperial centre like london extracts wealth from the periphery to its centre, so does the capitalist from the worker.

To quote the father of Capitalism, Adam Smith: ""To found a great empire for the sole purpose of raising up a people of consumers, may at first sight appear a project fit only for a nation of shopkeepers. It is, however, a project altogether unfit for a nation of shopkeepers, but extremely fit for a nation whose government is influenced by shopkeepers."" (*Wealth of Nations*, Book IV, Chapter VII)

He is also firmly on the side of paying people enough: ""No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable."" (*Wealth of Nations*, Book I, Chapter VIII)

&gt;People didn't want planned obsolescence. I hope you don't believe politicians sell what people want, and by the way economics and politics are inseparable. I'd throw in military as well in the current system. Santa doesn't exist, it was your parents not the tooth fairy, and the free market is a fiction.

Here you are again making that worst of all arguments, the argument by association: ""Santa doesn't exist, therefore the free markets are a fiction"", please stop arguing like an idiot when you clearly aren't.

How many people immediately ran out to *queue* to buy the latest iPhone when their old one worked perfectly. People are fickle. They want shiny toys. Apple is the ultimate, disgusting expression of that. But the fact that Apple exists is a standing testament that contrary to your assertion, there are a lot of people who literally buy into this built in obsolescence. This is consumerism and I don't like it, and it's unsustainable. But consumerism is a result of our present system, rather than the heart of Capitalism. A capitalist system can be run without consumerism, if you don't believe me, I refer you to The Wealth of Nations; Adam Smith has plenty to say on the evils of consumerism.

The perfectly free market *should* not exist. The market must be restrained by government to serve the best interests of the people (*Wealth of Nations*, Book IV, Chapter IX), as doing unsavory things is often in the interests of pure profit. And lets be clear, a market will exist any time people trade. A market will exist in your anarchist communes, and it will be a free market - because there'll be no government in place to try and restrain it. Some people think this is best, they call themselves *anarcho-capitalists*.

The main feature of this was that it was a flat rate tax. This was immediately controversial, and led to a vigorous protest movement, culminating in violent disorder, known as the [Poll Tax Riots]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poll_Tax_Riots).

What people usually object to is people who display undesirable traits (violence, antisocial behaviour etc.).  When this happens to involve groups who are visibly different, it's *easy* to say that they do this because they are *not like us*, which is *because they are foreign*.  It's not in itself justified, but it happens often enough.  With some mass media outlets (Daily Mail, Telegraph) publicising the negative, and mentioning race/nationality, then even without bias in the reporting, people are led to associate that group with that behaviour, even if their personal experiences differ (hence my anecdotes above).  This is why propaganda works, and why 'If you repeat a lie often enough, it becomes the truth'.

As for the paragraph in the linked article:
&gt; David Cameron has promised to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands a year, instead of hundreds of thousands, amid fears about pressure on public services. 

This serves as a call to action of sorts - the Telegraph conveys these interesting (but not worrying) statistics, and immediately discusses reducing these statistics by referring to an authority figure.  It is, to be fair to the Telegraph, properly balanced after that with a discussion of the benefits of immigration, but what most people will recall in a months time will be a sense of the headline (1 in 4) and that Cameron promised to do something about it.

true,Wolphoenix,null,null,"&gt;Honour killings are targeted attacks most commonly against particularly innocent and vulnerable women that do nothing but support outdated patriarchial power, which are closely linked with islamic culture. 

Honour killings are a term invented by the Western world to label any murder that a Muslim commits with regards to his or her own family or relatives or any possible variant of that. When it comes to defining this sort of murder by ourselves, we label it ""crime of passion"" and other names, just so we can sound different than those ""barbarians"" with their ""culture"", and we count mitigating circumstances such as provocation. When a non-Muslim man murders his wife for cheating on him, we don't call it an ""honour killing"" even though he kills her because she has dishonored him by cheating on him. But if a Muslim man murders his wife because she cheated on him and dishonoured him, suddenly we call that ""honour killing"". This is why I refuse to call ""honour killings"" anything else than murder. It's a damn shame our courts have gone along with this anti-Muslim bias.

&gt;I do not for a second think that these kids at Victoria station aren't in the wrong, but I'm willing to bet in hindsight a lot of them would regret what they've done and be genuinely remorseful. And that differentiates from honour killings for me at least, where the families stand by the awful things they've done and genuinely believe they are acceptable

All criminals think that what they do is justified. It is only after years of punishment that they rethink their position. 

&gt;It's not about religion, it's about mentality and intent.

And the same mentality that we see in ""honour killings"" are prevalent in a lot of other murders. But we don't label that ""honour killing"". Why not? Because to be labelled ""honour killing"" it must have been committed while Muslim. That's the only difference.

&gt;But, I don't know a great deal about this, so please point out if I'm being naïve again

Don't get me wrong. I am not attacking you. I am just trying to point out some inherent bias I keep noticing again and again in our society where perfectly rational and intelligent people are getting swept up with how the media portrays Muslim and Arab criminals.

That was the case until a couple of weeks back when I watched the first episode of season 5 with Matt Smith. And this time I loved it! Matt Smith is great as the doctor and Amy and Rory are the perfect companions. And together they make each and every episode exciting and interesting.

true,DangerousMousePad,null,null,"A) What is Belfast like? - Since your coming from Glasgow you will notice that the cities are quite similar though for some fucking reason Belfast City Council seem to think it's ok to knock down lovely Victorian buildings (that's a rant for another time). Like Glasgow you have your good and bad areas (depending on what side of the fence you sit on if any). The city centre is quite compact which makes for easy navigation, I would say Glasgow city centre is bigger with likes of Succihall St, Buchanan Galleries and St Enoch centre  etc.. where as we have Castle Court and Victoria centre (gonna have to plug InShops as well) plus a few good shops if your willing to explore. Nightlife is good though I haven't been back in sometime so I don't know if this 2am shut thing is still going or not. But there are bars and clubs to cater to most music tastes.

B) Areas for flat hunting - Right this is difficult as weigh up whether you live in the city centre (or close enough to walk to work) or do you use public transport to get around?? Areas I would recommend are Lisburn Rd, South Belfast and surrounding areas [Google Maps link](http://goo.gl/maps/hTfiJ) the further up you go out of the city centre the nicer it becomes, you may also want to look at Stranmillis, and Malone. You might also want to look at the North of the city around the Antrim Road area and some places up near Belfast Castle are nice and leafy there (if that is what you are into, plus there are some good primary schools up there too).  If you let me know where about in Glasgow you live I could try and make a comparison (or alternative depends on how much you wish to spend) This also relates to schools too. As i think you have to be in the catchment area.. and this also boils down to which side of the fence you are on as unfortunately some primary/secondary schools in this day and age still ask for baptism records.

C) Schools - see point B not to clued on primary schools but secondary/grammar schools there are many to choose from and you find out fairly quickly (if you plan to stay that long with your daughter) which ones are held in high esteem.

D) Transport - If anyone commuted 2 hours in Belfast I think they would be living in the other side of the country! Depending on where you choose to live, you'll find that the route will either be served by Citybus / Ulster Bus or a the train. I use to live in the north or the city and would take around 25/35 minutes depending on traffic and which bus route I took. Some roads can get mega busy in the mornings which is just down to them being pretty badly laid out. 

If your new work is near the BBC building you won't be short of places to go for lunch and things like. The city hall is only 5/10 mins walk away and most Citybus buses leave from here. You also Europa Bus and Train station a short walk away which serves a lot of destinations. 

I suppose some of questions would be what sort of area do you want to or like to live in i.e. do you want to be near the hustle of the city or do you want somewhere quiet. Also do you have own a car? As this may extend your rental options, as it can be easier to use a car than depend on public transport (sometimes). I don't want to ask but more of statement as I mentioned during the above your religious leaning (if any) **may** have some bearing on what school your daughter can attend. My sister had the same problem with her children when they where younger (children where born to parents of two different religions so neither where baptised or christened).

I disagree. Paedophilia is uncommon. The fear of paedophilia is very common however. Just for contrast 2,000 children (aged 2 to 17) a year DIE of flu. So realistically your child is much more likely to die (from all possible causes, flu, car accidents, cancer, etc) than be abused.    

But we have charities which go around inflating the figures so they get more funding. For one example many of them expand the definition of ""sexual abuse"" to include *words* from an adult of a sexual nature (and they ask very large age-ranges, so this ""abuse"" could have occurred at age 7 or age 15).   

I think there are things we can do to keep sex abuse under control like listening to victims and doing checks on people with regular contact with children, but this witch hunt has lost all proportion with the issue it attempts to address.

The only difference would be, presumably, that they would have to use advertising. There's nothing to stop private broadcasters being impartial, it's just that they wouldn't have the money that the BBC does to avoid having to be ""competitive"" with other sources like Sky by getting their hands dirty and going a bit Fox Newsish.

To be honest, if the choice was there, I would favour a free service with advertising than a paid one without them.

*Robot (1974), first serial of the Fourth Doctor (who held the role for seven years, the longest of all of the Doctors)

They said:

&gt;Apple itself must (having created the confusion) make the position clear: that it acknowledges that the court has decided that these Samsung products do not infringe its registered design

but then granted Apple the ability to hide the statement:

&gt;Mr Carr realistically recognised that Apple had a genuine interest in keeping it uncluttered.

Another thing worth noting is the legal document states the notice should be:

&gt; On 9th July 2012 the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Samsung Electronic (UK) Limited's Galaxy Tablet Computers, namely the Galaxy Tab 10.1, Tab 8.9 and Tab 7.7 do not infringe Apple's registered design No. 0000181607-0001. A copy of the full judgment of the High court is available on the following link [link given].


&gt;That Judgment has effect throughout the European Union and was upheld by the Court of Appeal on ….. A copy of the Court of Appeal's judgment is available on the following link […]. There is no injunction in respect of the registered design in force anywhere in Europe.

By injecting their own paragraphs is Apple breaking the order? And without a doubt the last paragraph intentionally blurs what the court makes clear it's aiming for with the statement which is basically that here in the UK we've decided Samsung's tablets are fine and that's all that should matter within the UK, legal activities elsewhere should have zero effect on your choice of device.

When I first saw ""Rose"" (Eccleston's first episode), it was my first experience with 'Doctor Who', and I was confused.

""What the hell is going on?"", was my main thought, while ""Plastic aliens?"" was a close second. Not to mention I watched it with my Sci-Fi hating wife.

""Why is this older man taking so much of an interest in this younger girl, and why did see willingly go with him at the end? Just what the hell...?""

After that first episode ended, I'll admit it, my wife and I looked at each other, said, ""What the hell?"", once more, and put 'Doctor Who' back on the shelf.

Now, the main reason why we gave it that first try, was because we enjoyed 'Torchwood: Miracle Day' a fair amount. When the season was nearing its end, I did some quick googling to see if it would be back for a ""second season"", only to find that 'Miracle Day' was actually the fourth season.

While continuing to look into Torchwood info, I found out that it was a spin-off. 

""A spin off to...Doctor Who? That show with the silly plastic alien?""

When finally learning this, it had been about 2 or 3 months since my wife and I first tried out 'Doctor Who'. I told her about my 'findings', and we agreed to give it a second go.

We watched ""The End of the World"", thought it was better, but still nothing worth noting. Watched ""The Unquiet Dead"" and thought ""Hey, look, Gywn!"", which gave us a little more ['oomph'](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=oomph) towards the show.

Then we watched ""Aliens of London/World War Three"", and put the show back on the shelf for a little while. It was just too silly. We didn't understand.

It wasn't on the shelf for too long this time, before we decided ""One more try"".

That last 'try', well, it was ""Dalek"". Oh.My.God.

How did this rolling toaster bring so much fear? How is this the ultimate villain? It's just so...silly. So odd.

It worked.

[""Why don't you just die?!""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Hmv80q5fAWU#t=211s)

.....Damn

Then came ""Father's Day"" and ""The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances"".

How did this silly show convey emotions so well? It's [terrifying](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38DgjKQhhys), [sad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFQQVEd5LoM) (hell, just re-watching that short clip gets me), [whimsical](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=E83ZLtYar7s#t=488s), [humorous](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E83ZLtYar7s&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=237s), [mysterious](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18Va0qZ4EZY), [empowering](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=5ecycHAZtaM#t=53s),......[epic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=nCCMg-rcCQk#t=78s).

In these tough times perhaps the general population should really consider what is more important to them...

1) Sacking police officers, closing hospitals, etc so we can keep funding prohibition (which damages society far more than any drug), keep retricting the freedoms of people who do no wrong to society.

2) Not sacking police, closing hospitals, etc - getting £100000 in tax, not damaging the lives of otherwise law abiding people, not allowing prohibition to allow the funding of criminal gangs. Making drugs safer...

For the 'safer' point, here is a good example....

Cannabis sold by a lot of gangs in the UK is **toxic**. 

Due to the fact that weed is not legal there are going to be major health issues in the not too distant future...

Criminal gangs have been spaying silica of weed to mimic the look of THC (and increase weight) for years. Silica causes Silicosis... 

So because weed is illegal, and its illegal to 'protect us' it has made the safest drug on the planet to become dangerous to human health .... Isn't prohibition just fucking great !

Its like moonshine in the 30's USA ....

This privatization your so fond of is going to mean that only the rich can afford vital services.

Your example of water companies in 76 also isn't that valid. It was due to 76 that things changed, not privatization - i.e the shock created a change in policy - this coupled with the global warming theory made governments around the world change their policies.

true,kenny-rogers,null,null,"&gt; Here you are again making that worst of all arguments, the argument by association: ""Santa doesn't exist, therefore the free markets are a fiction"", please stop arguing like an idiot when you clearly aren't.

It's kinda getting boring to read pro-capitalist dogma and other oddities so I'll be brief. If you truly believe that's the argument that is being made in the above quoted section and not a poetic phrasing with the subtext ""you are naive"", then I'm in a difficult position.

&gt; How many people immediately ran out to queue to buy the latest iPhone when their old one worked perfectly. People are fickle. They want shiny toys.

People are taught. A kid doesn't know the difference between the toy and the wrapper, it has to be shown that one needs to be thrown away and the other played with.

&gt; This is consumerism and I don't like it, and it's unsustainable. But consumerism is a result of our present system, rather than the heart of Capitalism. A capitalist system can be run without consumerism, if you don't believe me, I refer you to The Wealth of Nations; Adam Smith has plenty to say on the evils of consumerism.

You dismiss anarchism (which isn't a synonym for chaos but in brief mutual aid and ruling by consent) out of hypothetical failure (and irrational fear), and you promote capitalism sans consumerism out of hypothetical success! The argument that it can happen because Smith may have wrote about it is peculiar indeed. We have had 500 years of something like capitalism and we are yet again on the brink of a world war, probably the fourth. War is the end of capitalism because industry must fight over control of resources so it must deny other people wealth. (Psuedo-real-quasi-bastardised) Capitalism therefore is an irrational distribution of resources and labour in reality, but also in theory, if the competitive model holds true. 

I don't believe the greatest atrocity should be thought of as Hitler it is one of a collection, that would be Western propaganda, and any way both capitalists brought his party and Stalin to power. Firstly 6 million jews in ovens was a myth first propagated by Soviets advancing west, and is incorrect by pro-holocaust standards who seem to have adopted a theoretical maximum of about 1.5 given the available time and infrastructure constraints, and like you said why go to that expense when trying to fight a war? The figure is much lower, and it is peculiar that there were a bunch of Jewish Kapos supposed tasked with day to day running of the system. Spending all that effort building barracks seems a little strange as well. Most looked to have died through malnutrition which makes sense because the German empire was under siege. The same thing happened with [the Bengal Famine of 1943](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943), however the British deliberately diverted supplies and destroyed infrastructure. Actually it makes great capitalist sense to exterminate the Jews or cause famines to save money on prison or other costs so in one sense it was completely rational and fiscally responsible. The same happens today, is a recall for a brake system known to fail going to be more expensive than the potential lawsuits?

People naturally drift towards anarchism, it is only through indoctrination and violence that hierarchy is perpetuated: religion, military, mass advertising, organised sport, terrorist propaganda, the class system brought about by Capitalism. Capitalism is more a set of forced irrational choices where production for the sake of production becomes the norm, which elevates a minority to power who then go on to abuse their power especially in times of crisis.

&gt; The market must be restrained by government to serve the best interests of the people

Again how naive. Governments wield armies to create markets in the first place. They set the rules like corporate law, debt enforcement, intellectual property, and create the monetary system. That would be one of the contradictions of capitalism, it loves big government (especially big military).

&gt; Some people think this is best, they call themselves anarcho-capitalists.

Anarchist philosophy quickly moved on from that, as did capitalism from the Wealth of Nations.

Blink, while good, is over-rated.  It almost annoys me that people try and push that episode as the first Doctor Who episode to show newcomers.  

Silence in the Library / Forest of the Dead was fun the first time I saw it when it aired.  When I heard that Moffat was taking over as head writer for Doctor Who I was pretty damn excited to see what he would do with River Song.  As it stands now, I am not disappointed.

true,superpencil,null,null,"A.) In my opinion Belfast is...slow. There is less opportunity over here. On the high streets there are more shops closed than open. It's literally governed by murderers and terrorists... Who do a god awful job of running the country. If you ask me... if you are going to make a big move, go somewhere with potential and opportunity for your daughter and yourself. Go somewhere where religion doesn't dictate what streets you can walk down and what area you can live in. I don't like anything about Belfast, I have lived here all my life and am in the process of emigrating to Canada. Anyone who says Belfast has changed a lot in the past few years is right.. It isn't as bad as it was by a long stretch but its still riddled with sectarianism, violence and hate. And we might not have NEDS but we do have spides who are just as bad.

B.) I'm sure it's obvious even to people that dont live here that Belfast is still divided. Your decision about where you live will largely be based on your religious background. For example: moving to East Belfast as a Catholic would not be a good idea. It's as simple and backwards as that.

C.) Schools in NI are rated by this system. http://www.etini.gov.uk/index/inspection-reports.htm
Have a read of potential schools and see what rating they have. I am pretty sure education is slightly better the further out of the city you go. Lisburn, which is 20mins from Belfast (9 mins by express train) is a highly desirable area for schools.

D.) Public transport is decent... On some days it can be a total disaster, on others it's fine.

E.) Have only been to Glasgow City twice. Thought it looked quite similar to Belfast. Other than that I don't really know much about it.

This will probably get downvoted massively because I'm not saying what great craic there is over here in our wee Belfast that people who don't live here seem to adore so much.

Without getting into the rights or wrongs of it all, there was a decent level of animosity between the Police and population here.

The word class did not get thrown around much, but that's pretty much what it was about. The Liverpool fans could be dehumanised and smeared after the event because they already were smeared by the Police and in the pages of the Sun etc everyday. Northern working class scum.

The Hillsborough report moved me a lot more than anything else that has happened recently in the news. The local news interviewed one of the parents, a guy who has been on the news a fair few times before and is normally calm and collected. 

He broke down in tears after hearing the findings, and talked about how his daughters had been branded drunken thugs, louts etc and how he'd had to wait until now for that stain to be removed from their memory.

Let's say a very high ranking and powerful journalist at the Mail used his job and status as a tool to visit vulnerable children, where he would abuse them, and the bosses at the Daily Mail heard about this (repeatedly) from credible sources and he was investigated by the police. The Mail decides *not* to take *any action whatsoever* to stop this, to prevent further people being abused, and continues to pay this journalist to travel around the country, visiting young children, as the scale of rumours and gossip continues to rise. 

I'm not saying the BBC should be dismantled, or that even people should be sacked, I just find it annoying that this issue is being politicised by people (usually on the right) looking to attack the BBC for their own reasons, and people on the left are blindly defending the BBC in turn.

So they wouldn't do it. You'd have to pay them more to make it worthwhile. To be fair most childminders and babysitters are either housewives or teenage girls who aren't on benefits anyway- so (although I get your point) that's a bit of a bad example.

However, many part-time jobs (like the one my mum had after losing her ""real"" job) pay barely any more than benefits as it is. It was only worth her while because my dad pays for the house instead of child support- so for the majority in the same position it would make more financial sense to be on benefits. People do them anyway because sitting around a house will make you want to kill yourself eventually, if you don't have enough money for distractions.

&gt;I turn to the form of the publicity order. No more than that which is proportionate is necessary. As regards the newspaper publicity we had no complaint about the detail of that and, subject to the wording, I would affirm Judge Birss's order. As regards publicity on the Apple home web page, Mr Carr realistically recognised that Apple had a genuine interest in keeping it uncluttered. He proposed that instead of requiring the notice to be on the web page itself, it would be sufficient if there were a link provided from that to the notice. There are some links already provided. All that need be added is a link entitled ""Samsung/Apple UK judgment."" I think that would be appropriate and proportionate.

&gt;As regards the period for which the link should appear, Mr Carr recognised that a one month period would probably suffice. So I think it should be required for a month from the date the order of this Court is made. But for the fact that Apple have agreed to obtain discharge of the order of the Oberlandesgericht I would have considered a longer period necessary.

true,ibpants,1972crest,,"I'm with you on almost all of this.  Mancini is a top manager with an outstanding record and it's troubling to hear City fans being so negative about him.  When did we become so impatient and fickle?  We're the motherfucking Champions for fuck's sake!

I see what you mean about what 3 at the back offers us going forwards (which is no doubt what Mancini was thinking about at the time).  I was cooing over the idea in preseason - genuine width, 2 dedicated strikers, etc. but it's looked pretty flimsy defensively for the most part.  Again, I'm sure Mancini was more concerned about going forwards, but 3 in the back was an absolute gift to the way Ajax were set up - they didn't have anyone playing centrally right up against our centre backs, but they were caning us down the flanks.

I also don't think it's too much of a stretch to think that Mancini has been influenced by a largely successful tactic in a league he no doubt takes an interest in.  He's dabbled with 3 centre backs before, but it seems to me that it was always used to close the match out and cement the lead.  This season is the first time I've seen it used with the kind of attacking intent we saw in Serie A last year.  

I think it's great that Mancini is willing to update his tactics as football continues to evolve, I just don't know if the players have had enough time to get completely comfortable with this iteration of 3 at the back.

And yeah, the constant whining about zonal marking does my head in too.  I watched the Arsenal match on telly and one of the commentators (I don't remember who, some Scottish bloke) actually said ""Yeah, maybe statistically zonal marking concedes fewer goals, but I just don't like it.""... ????",0,1351266937,null,0,false,0,c6s3ujc,t3_124cg3,t1_c6s3ujc,t3_124cg3,null,1430245504,5,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,5

He made the goal with his little ball to Falque, and then he bundled it into the net. 

I think if JD had played better in the first half and if Townsend hadn't been on, Gylfi could have had a stormer. Defoe needs to realize if he's static the whole team tends to be static.

Britain punches well above its weight in what it achieves and where its influence is found.

How can anyone describe the British as inward looking, the country that banned and fought international slave traders, and when they were the world's first and only empire to willingly introduce something along the lines of the 1926 Imperial Conference.  The country that brought together and signed the Singapore Declaration, gave the World Band Aid, continues with Sports Relief, and is set to be the largest net contributor per capita to the EU.

I've found that for folks that are new to the show, or especially new or new-ish to genre television in general, it's been best to start them with Smith then talk them into starting from Eccleston and moving forward.  A few of my friends I've had start at Eccleston, either because they're familiar with genre TV or were adamant about at least starting at that ""beginning"" and I've spent most of a season going ""no, no, trust me, it gets good, really...just keep watching...yes, yes I know, it's really cheesy, but that's kind of the point...""

So I'd say it'd depend on the folks you have over, but Eleventh Hour has been great at just grabbing folks and sucking them in.  Personally I love it all, but the higher production value on Smith's episodes tends to make them more palatable for the newbies.

He was rather dismayed (not sure if that is the best way to describe his reaction and views) at the lack of knowledge of Old English, Germanic and Celtic myth and folklore in England so he wrote LoTR and the hobbit as a reimagining and a way to reintroduce the themes and stories and idea from the Sagas and Eddas.

Then Tennant came along. He may have been 35, but I for sure didn't see him as that age. Looked just gone 30 in my opinion. The chemistry was there between him and the companion as well, which was great.

I understand what you mean about having contrasting ages to help relate to real characters, but for me, the Doctor is best to be young/young looking. Smith's Doctor makes me think he IS an older man, but in a youthful body. That's just the perfect interpretation in my opinion. 

Then as a side note there is always this tiny bit of me that wants the Doctor to be with the companion, so younger is better in this case. Probably started because of this 10/Rose thing. When SE5 came out, I hated Rory at first because I wanted it to be 11/Amy, because of the chemistry.

Mancini is not completely to blame, but he's not completely blameless either. And that's not really a problem for me as there are no perfect managers.

I think the issue here is when people rush to identify a scapegoat. I'm really disappointed in the defensive performances so far and think it's a problem worth discussing, but not a single defensive player on our squad can't be held accountable for a mistake that resulted in a goal against. Mancini is an easy target and no one wants to write treatises on Vinnie's foolish dribbling.

Things like zonal marking will always have their detractors; if the players are comfortable with it and it results in fewer goals, who needs to listen? And a lot of people just want to find fault with us to begin with, so whatever Mancini does will be wrong, even when there's a great case for why it was right. To me, the only point that *really* matters is that he's delivered us two trophies so far and we continue to improve over the long term. It's hard to argue with success, and there are teams who'd kill to have Mancini as their manager. It's just tactics and preparation; there's absolutely no reason to assume he can't sort us out.

When this happens to involve groups who are visibly different, it's easy to say that they do this because they are not like us, which is because they are foreign.

That's very true. I'm Arab and I lived in the UK for 3 years. I went to uni in quite a rough city and violence/antisocial behaviour was in no way exclusive to one group. I saw it from persons of white origins, Caribbean origins, Pakistani origins, etc. While I certainly noticed that a significant number of people of foreign origin - especially Pakistanis -  were poorly integrated, most of the people I met were well integrated into British society. 

I've lived in 5 different countries in both the West and the Middle East and in my experience, people wherever you go have a habit of dismissing persons of their own culture behaving in a poor manner as being the exception and not the rule, while exactly the same behaviour by foreigners will be seen as representative of them all.

Honesty, I'm not that worried. Suarez wasn't exactly giving 100% the other night, especially off the ball. That, along with the fact that he seems to have inherited Dirk Kuyt's iron lungs, means that he will probably be alright for the Derby match. 

Gerrard always goes Optimus Prime in this fixture so I expect AT LEAST a goal from him. Perhaps Yesil will make an appearance? I also think Suarez will be subbed on in the League Cup match next week.

Our boys in Afghanistan did not sacrifice themselves for us, or for democracy or freedom or anything like that.

The invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan are war crimes, and we're allowing Blair to get away with that.

Those deaths are a tragic waste and a travesty of justice. 

These soldiers - those from Afghanistan and Iraq as well as those from WWI and WWII - are victims of war and they're victims of our politicians.

The best way to honour all of them is for us to say that war is not acceptable, and that we won't allow it again. 

We should not be allowing the same politicians who sent our soldiers to war to stand at memorial services wearing ""remembrance"" poppies. Their doing so is disgusting. If they honoured the lives of our troops they wouldn't send them to die in the desert in the first place.

Wearing a red poppy is saying that you're ok with that.

The current government have done a lot of damage by hijacking the tuition fee process, to transfer the cost of University from the taxpayer to the student, but at least a student entering University now gets a decent education, thanks to Labour's tuition fee increases (see link above). Ultimately, the major problem for people going to University isn't the tens of thousands they have to pay after they get their education (if they earn a decent salary), but rather the quality of the education which will allow them to earn that decent salary, amounting to [hundreds of thousands more over their lifetime](http://i.imgur.com/UkEK8.png)*, creating the basis for a prosperous economy for themselves and for everyone else.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"I have an optimistic feeling about this one. Although this sounds too easy to say, I had been tempted to go for draws against Wednesday and Charlton, but in the end had decided to be positive in the face of nearly overwhelming cynicism (although in the case of Charlton I was motivated by the thought that, after so many draws, we were due to win sooner rather than later).

However, Birmingham have been lacklustre this season and - crucially - don't have Zigic, who seemed perfectly able to exploit our Achilles' heel last season. I'm convinced that we'll come out looking much more positive than we did against Charlton (it could hardly get worse, could it?) and hopefully we'll have wait it takes to win it. We'll still concede, though. **2-1 to Leeds**.

Here's the team I predict to play:

---------------Kenny

Byram---Lees---Pearce---Peltier

White---Norris---Austin---Tonge

---------------Diouf

---------------Becchio

Substitutes: Ashdown, Kisnorbo, Green, Brown, Varney, Hall, Gray.

There is still a good chance that he'll continue playing Brown: he's certainly been playing no worse than certain other players, but if Austin is fit then I struggle to see him leaving him out of the starting line-up, while I'd been surprised to see Norris dropped after he scored on Tuesday. Tonge is a dead cert to start - it seems as though Warnock has actually come to rely on him, which is interesting.

White, on the other hand, is not as likely to start as Tonge. An article in the *Yorkshire Post* claimed that Warnock put him on against Charlton with the mission to go hell-for-leather in attack, but he got the wrong end of the stick and spent the game defending instead. I think that his position will soon start to come under threat from the likes of Hall and Byram. I doubt that the former will start, although I can see him being brought on for him debut tomorrow, while the latter is looking increasingly wasted at full back, but I think he'll stay there until Drury becomes capable of more than one game a week.",0,1351286088,null,0,false,0,c6s94kg,t3_124u04,t1_c6s94kg,t3_124u04,null,1430247951,3,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,3

There's an ongoing debate at the moment between two sides; those that want to play a larger part inside a greater unified Europe, and those that want to play an even greater role with an emphasis on the Anglosphere and Commonwealth which includes a third of the planet's population.  Neither is insular.

&gt; There are endless programmes on British history, wildlife, culture etc etc yet far less informing of other places, unless they are ex-empire. 

Cobblers.

There's also a rich vein of travel programmes, endless programmes about living abroad and iconic programmes from Michael Palin's wanderings to David Attenborough's global endeavours.   Unless they are ex-empire includes a 3rd of the world, so what you're really incorrectly saying is that Britons have little interest in the outside world when you ignore the 3rd of the world which you admit they are well versed in.

Let's also forget that the British passport is the single greatest document the world has in it when it comes to enabling travel bar none. No other travel document available to civilians will get you into more places without having to apply for a visa.

&gt;Yes, there is a rich history full of achievement, but for any amount of chest thumping and flag waving one does, this is a massively inward looking nation.

Betty Swollocks, it is.

If anything for the amount Britain spends poking its nose into other people's business and occupying the international it could do with being a little more introspective if anything, which by the way is not necessarily a bad thing. As for 'chest thumping and flag waving', are we even talking about the same country?  Britain is known for taking the piss out of itself and being eternally embarrassed when it comes to flag waving.  People were commenting during the Olympics that to have a little pride, optimism and championing made a nice change.  Normally it gets rolled for Last Night Of The Proms before being put back into its box for another year.

Are you sure you know what inward-looking means?  This is a country that is going through austerity and yet still INCREASED its foreign aid by 38%.  This is the country that not only pushed for the G8 to do more, it's also the country that balled out the G8 when they were failing to meet their commitments, and that's by a Conservative Prime Minister, calling G8 leaders a bunch of suits that make promises to the world's poorest and  then forget them over lunch!    This is the country that gives more of a percentage of its GDP to foreign aid than *any other country* in the world.  Bill Gates championing his charity vaccination programme applauded the UK for taking a world lead.  The chief executive of the international charity Save The Children actually singled out the UK and Norway saying they needed more countries like them, urging the the leaders of other countries and the EU to take their example.  The UK schools and vaccinates more overseas children in one year than it does in the entire UK.

It's one of the few things we're doing right.  The UK is not only not inward looking and self obsessed, it's the world leader in its weight category to the contrary!

Study with a student from China, and witness their amazement at the degree to which British students challenge their teachers. Also, Surestart looks set to have an important impact on helping students from impoverished backgrounds to become more articulate, and able to stamp their individuality more clearly.

You are wrong to imply that individualism equates to, paraphrasing, 'rioting, looting, taking drugs, fucking everything up and getting angry'. Mostly, those are the actions of a unit in a mob, not an individual.

The Fifth doctor (Peter Davidson)- 

* ""Castrovalva"" - Right after regenerating, and having issues stabilizing as the new doctor 
* ""Mawdryn Undead"" - Introduces the companion Turlough, features the brigadier. 
* ""The Five Doctors"" - All 5 doctors together.. (well Sorta, since well William Hartnell had already passed, his doctor is played by a different actor)

The Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker)

* ""The Two Doctors"" - Features the second doctor and his companion Jamie. A bit silly and Jamie looks way to old to play the part but I enjoyed the episode enough to recommend
* The real suggestion to watch for the sixth doctor unfortunately is an entire season ""The Trial of a Time Lord"" where the doctor is put on trial. Introduces the Valeyard.


The Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy)

* ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" - Already mentioned this one previously.
* ""Silver Nemesis"" - This is a story that hinted at back story from before the series started and I wish we could get back to it. it was in fact the 25th anniversary special.
* ""Ghost Light"" - Timey-Wimey
* ""Curse of Fenric"" - some more timey-wimey stuff here.

It's all rubber. Details are painted pretty well. The strap is very small. I have narrow wrists, so I can get by, but most people will need to replace the strap. Very easily done as it's not attached to the rest of it, it just loops through 2 slots. The pin for the strap is metal, but the actual buckle is entirely plastic. Fairly sturdy, but might require replacement.

Don't expect much from the interior. It's just a detailed, painted, plastic housing with 2 LED ports that illuminate when you press the one active button on the far right. Uses 1 LED to illuminate both ports. Snaps are metal and secure very well. It's constructed with it's ""worn"" shape in mind, so the cover fits too snugly when laying flat, but PERFECTLY when worn. Cover stays closed without issue.

Sonic Screwdriver is a smaller scale (2/3 actual size) and doesn't extend. No sounds from either device. Sonic illuminates the end cap, but it's just an LED with a blue plastic cover, not a blacklight like the full-sized prop.

This season he already has 4 goals in 8 games (which is best on the team, and only 2 behind the league leader). Last season he had 12 goals in 59 games in all competitions, this year he's scored 6 in 14 games (including the Comm. shield and Super cup). 

I don't understand how *anyone* can say that his performances haven't improved enough? Is he destroying defenses in every game? No. Is he consistent every game? No. But who is?

He isnt a left back so will be caught out of position as he doesnt know what to do. In such a high pressure game he'd crumble playing out of position. And Wisdom has been a rock so theres no need to drop him, we havent lost with him in the side yet.

Secondly, the PCC is supposedly going to oversee how Police funding is spent and hold the Chief Constables of each constabulary to account. But I thought local MPs, councillors and the Home Office should, and often are,  already be doing that.

Lastly, they will be able to devise their own Crime &amp; Police Plan, which the Chief Constable (and their constabulary) will have take into account. And all of this could potentially be undertaken by someone with no relevent experience or qualification to do so.

In my county, there are fortunately two independent candidates both of which have prior experience with police matters (although this isn't the case for every county). If I were to vote, it would likely be for one of them, but how often in elections do non-party affiliated candidates win?

I suggest someone like [Mary Anning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Anning) whose ""work contributed to the fundamental changes in scientific thinking about prehistoric life and the history of the earth that occurred in the early 19th century""; [Hertha Ayrton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertha_Ayrton) the first woman to become a member of the Institute of Electrical Engineers whose work in her lifetime was constantly attributed to men or ignored because she was a married woman; [Rosalind Franklin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin) whose theoretical model of DNA was the basis of the work of Watson and Crick. Some of her work was co-opted by quite underhand means according to contemporary reports. What about [Dorothy Hodgkin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Hodgkin) who analysed the molecular structure of complex chemicals including antibiotics (penicillin and cephalosporin C), cholesterol, vitamins (D and B12 used to treat anaemia) and hormones. 

Many more people are aware of Alan Turing than are aware of these women and the profound effect that they had on their fields and on how people in their fields viewed women and their contributions and frankly society as a whole should appreciate their work more.

""B...b..but"", I hear some of you cry, ""we haven't heard of any of these women, you gotta be famous to be on a bank note...""

What is this madness? Let me explain the thinking behind it. 

We play Suarez wider, leaving what looks like a vacant place where the striker plays. Allowing Gerrard and/or Jonjo to venture forward and act as a striker. 

Picking Assaidi because he impressed midweek and think he's earned a start. And because I'm worried little Raheem will get butchered in what will likely be a physical game (the derby can get rough). Bring him on late in the second half (70ish minute) so he can run rings around the now tiring opposition.

Eleven is very much like the old doctor and I don't enjoy that character as much.  I find him cruel and untrustworthy, his the motivation are hard to predict.

Nine needed a companion to help him recover.  Eleven wants a companion for amusement and doesn't seem to mind the consequences.  I hope the future Doctor goes back in the direction of Nine.

The language in the Satan Pit, was an unknown language, the race who wrote it was also an unknown race for the most part. Remember that ""Satan"" said he came from before time itself... The Tardis does not translate the language of the Judoon simply because it's the law. Meaning that the Shadow proclamation probably has a law on the book, or maybe even the Time Lords had the law on the books, that Judoon was not to be translated by Tardises, or maybe the law is that the Tardis not translate a language when that languagei s part of a challenge to test intelligence oand/or knowledge of a race, and the Tardis does not translate Old High Galifreyian, I think this is also due to a restriction in place by law. Second: The Tardis translates into the language of the listener. So the Doctor probably hears the translation in Gallifreyian while Rose, Martha, Donna and the Ponds hears the translation in English. Third: The Tardis only translates for those who have been inside as a companion to the Doctor. Fourth: The Translation the Tardis does is psychic in nature. It makes a psychic connection with all parties involved. Distance from the Tardis does not seem to be a problem. Fifth: It translates all communication/linguistic forms, spoke, written, and other forms of communication.

What the fuck. Michu, Jermain Defoe, Steven Fletcher, Luis Suárez, Demba ba. all those players have score more goals than him and dont even have half of the creativeness we have on our team and cost waaaaaaaaaaaaaay more less than he did. Most of you know deep down Torres have been shit since he arrive that the reason soon the name Torres is mention you jump into self defense mode and try to protect him. torres is a grown man if he want to be protected or stop all this criticism he have 90 minutes every week some times 180 minutes to prove all his haters and doubters wrong, But week in week out he tend not to give a shit, he havent improves on nothing and at the end when someone mention Torres in this subreddit. the constant pouring of downvote being. We all want to see Torres succeed ,  But I wouldnt be biased as you to protect him even though he not doing shit to help the team. the last 6 games in row he had 5 or 6 chances where it was only him and the goalkeeper and somehow he always manage to fluff his lines. Torres is not what we pay for by the time you all realized that and put the pressure on him he will deliver. last season.

* Liverpool Former Manager Bob Paisley once said. “If you’re in the penalty area and don’t know what to do with the ball, put it in the net and we’ll discuss the options later.” Torres should do exactly that and maybe he will finall justify his huge price tag. 50 Million. 

* Torres cost us 50 million and it took him 20 games to finally score his first goal. and his current stats are 79 games with 18 goals. But anytime that mention most of you guys get mad.
* Salomon Kalou 256 games and was used mostly as a sub and score 60 goals but you guys constantly hated him and never even wanted to see him play. Why should Torres be treated any special.

My impression is that, having seen the overthrow of other vile dictators and the consequences thereof, it might be better, on the whole, to suffer under a fiendish dictator who maintains stability than to have one's country plunged into a civil war that tears society apart and causes tens of thousands of deaths. 

The mainstream media presents the Syrian civil war in a very narrow context. It assumes that the anti-government factions are somehow good guys against Assad's bad guys and it can't be trusted to reveal what might be any external influences, if such exist. 

Ultimately, I don't know enough about Syria or the civil war there to feel like I have a grasp on the situation so I mentioned it in the context of thinking that RT is biased towards Assad but might be offering something more accurate than the BBC - i.e. BBC's reporting is so poor that the source representing the ""baddies"" might be the lesser of evils, in this case. 

By the by, I don't know anything about posters n Bradford but why would people be pro-Assad? Do you have expertise about Syria to really know something or might there be popular support for Assad, rightly or wrongly?

When I became a full on news junkie (um, I seem to recall a date towards the end of 2001....) and had a cable TV subscription, I would watch BBC news then Sky and Sky was often quicker and better informed and presented a more rounded view. I would have rated the main news outlets on TV in the following order - Channel 4, Sky, BBC, ITV. Yes, I'm comparing turds. 

If Sky has gone more Fox-like, it doesn't really change the infotainment landscape very much and for Channel 4 to be the best of the bunch doesn't bode well for a free and open society.

Zombies are just as vulnerable as humans but with much diminished faculty and sense of self preservation. Also, how long does it take for a zombie to die of starvation? Their primary motivation for hunting humans is as a food source (braaiiiinnnss) but with diminishing returns as the human population decreases. It stands to reason that they would eventually starve as a function of their success. An oil rig has a pretty fair chance of surviving intact for say 10 years and the survivors can then make their way to the mainland. To be fair, I don't really follow zombie survival literature and there may have been a good deal I've overlooked.

true,eastlondonmandem,english,INGERLAND,"I think it's been like this for years. People are able to get housing benefit and then stay on it forever. That alone saves them loads of money. Do a few days a week and stay under the radar and you can have a home for life. Even more so if you have a kid or two. It might not be an amazing life but I think some people would rather sit on their arse than work 5 days a week.

I have actually asked a friend about his work situation and he said he was afraid to do more shifts as it would take him over the housing benefit limit and he would have to start paying £900/month to look after him and his son. He doesn't get enough shifts to cover the whole lot, so instead he sticks to doing a couple days a week at most. He has Sky, Broadband and smokes a lot (cigs and weed) and seems to live a comfortable if quite boring life.

Again I think most of my criticism is of the system rather than the people. People are kinda like water into a glass in my opinion, it will take the shape that is being provided by the glass.

And I never mentioned food stamps, anywhere. I just said it shouldn't be cash. In that, they shouldn't be literally given money which can then be spent on ANYTHING, because it's stupid and a large percentage will abuse it. They aren't grateful of it.

Just for a similar example... I work at a theme park and we have an ""exit riders"" system for disabled guests. Anyone who has any disability is entitled to use it, on the grounds that you can't apply to one and not the other. It's designed really to aid those who couldn't stand in line, or walk the long distance through the queue... Such as those who have trouble walking, or mentally cannot understand and tolerate the concept of a queue and would become frustrated. 

But, everyone uses it. Everyone. Some people don't ""look"" disabled (as other guests often point out, rudely), but clearly need the exit riders queue due to other non-obvious reasons, but most people who use it are just abusing it because they can. How do I know this? Because they don't understand the system and get angry at it. Everyone who NEEDS it uses it properly.

See, if the main queue is 2 hours and and exit rider comes on at the exit, they then have a time card where they cannot ride any other major attractions for 2 hours. And some people get SO angry and say ""whats the point then??"" er, so you don't have to stand in line, and can go sit down for two hours, enjoy something else, eat, etc... Not so you can just skip a queue.

And it's the MAJORITY who are trying to abuse the system. The genuine exit riders are a small minority.",0,1351336870,null,0,1351337730,0,c6sgxkb,t3_1228rk,t1_c6sgxkb,t1_c6s9j1d,null,1430251701,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The problem would be that that wasn't on the Demetrio recording, I imagine?

However, even if it had been - are the police justified in using that language? It seems that, as he was acquitted, people (the jury) think that they are. Zephaniah makes an excellent analogy with the disabled example - Would we consider a policeman saying ""You'll always be a crippled fuck."" to someone in a wheelchair who'd just described themselves in that way as being 'acceptable'? I wouldn't expect a police officer to swear at me, or around me, unless they'd just hurt themselves. Certainly not if they were arresting me, not least because they can arrest *me* for using such language.

Sadly I'd put money on it. For years claimants under the age of 25 were subject to lower rent rates - the ""Single Rent Room Rate"" or the local equivalent. Now that same rate applies to claimants under the age of 35. This means in a worst-case scenario a person in my neck of the woods aged over 25, but under the age of 35 will have lost £150 housing benefit¹

It won't happen by the end of this parliament, but by the end of the next? Odds are ""housing benefit"" for people aged under the age of 25 will be removed, except for under specific circumstances.

Add to that most JSA claimants will start paying council tax from next year, following the changes to the council tax benefits system - basically councils are having the amount they're able to claim back from central Government cut by 10%, and being given [limited] powers to decide who pays what. Put simply it's expected most JSA claimants will pay around 10 - 20% towards the cost of their council tax. So if their council tax is around £600 a year, they'd be expected to pay £60 - £120 towards it.

It depends on where you live. Like every city, you're never more than a few minutes from a bit of a shithole but, to be fair, our shitholes aren't that bad compared to cities in GB. Belfast is very small. I like the people; we're a relatively open, chatty and friendly bunch. Of course there is a loud, destructive, tiny minority who may make you think otherwise. I don't like that our nightlife scene is fairly shitty/quiet. I don't like Sunday trading legislation and other backwards policies and people in power, such as those trying to increase the minimum cost of drinks and make bars close at a particular time.

**b. the £100 000 question - what areas would you recommend for flat-hunting?**

[Click here](http://www.gumtree.com/flats-and-houses-for-rent-offered/belfast). If I were an outsider moving to Belfast I'd go with north or south Belfast. North Belfast if you work in Belfast City Centre and want to get home within half an hour (even in the northernmost parts). [This map](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/nicrimemap/) is out of date but if you go to 2008 it'll give you a general idea of how safe some areas are. However, you cannot tell if those clusters are statistically significant using that map alone so bear that in mind. [This](http://www.ninis.nisra.gov.uk/mapxtreme/InteractiveMaps/Crime/atlas.html) is more up-to-date and interactive and may be more useful.

**d. It would be cool if I didn't have to commute for two hours every day - what's public transport like? Please tell me it's better than in Glasgow?**

People like to shit on public transport but it's great here. The buses are anyway, I'm not familiar with the trains. There are about 6 buses I can take which drop me between 30 seconds and 3 minutes walking distance from my house and I'm not all that close to Belfast City Centre.

As JeremyKylesLovechild says above the stress will get to you. I've never been in the position where I couldn't pay my rent, but there was a month (just after I moved out) where I was late (due to things beyond my control) and I almost had a breakdown even though I *knew* I was fine, although that might just have been British guilt haha.

The general guideline I've read online is that you shouldn't spend &gt;30% of your post-tax income on rent, this can be stretched in certain circumstances but if you're in a position where you're paying over 50% you're probably not in a maintainable situation. The standard personal finance advice is to have an ""emergency fund"" of at least a few months; if you're living in the position where you're literally pay check to pay check (100% of income going out every month) you're setting yourself up for a huge problem.

Living costs stack up fast, it's really not wise to put yourself in a position where over 50% of your income is going towards putting a roof over your head.

true,cyphered,uk,Kent,"It probably depends on where you live, I'd say. I'm sharing a flat with 2 other people in Canterbury, which is a pretty expensive place to live (compared to London and places like that though, it's nothing). I'm the only one with a job - one is a student, his parents pay his rent, and the other's parents also pay her rent. We're paying £1,100 a month for an unfurnished 3-bed flat, no bills included. So I pay roughly £367 a month in rent.

Your rent also probably won't include your council tax, it'll be you that has to pay it. The expense will depend on where you live and the value of the place. We're in a Band C, quite lucky it's so low tbh, and we pay £160 a month. If you're the only person there you can get a 25% reduction in your council tax, but it still may be expensive.

I earn approximately £230 a week, at a 40hr job on £7 an hour, and I can make that rent plus my share of the council tax at a stretch, but I'm by no means rich. We also had to live in an empty flat with no furniture until we were able to either get together enough money to buy it or people could give us their old stuff.

You just have to take a look at rental prices in your area.

A local community is setting this up. Have you ever *been* to a community council meeting? With a few noble exceptions, it's made up of people who can't write a coherent sentence, yet are quite happy to start world war 3 over the location of the dogshit bins. I wouldn't trust them to recruit a competent fencepost. 

The main difference between Local Authorities and the community councils is that the former are professionals and (generally) have some clue about the law. However their procurement procedures, which are intended to make everything transparent and avoid corruption, mean that (a) everything costs 50% more than it should, (b) the overheads and admin costs for doing anything are 50% more than they should be, and (c) small-scale, simple solutions to simple problems are absolutely out of the question.

All of the above explains why civic administration in Britain is, and will always remain, shit: apart from a very small minority of genuinely talented, principled public servants, only arseholes *want* to work in such a hide-bound stifling environment. Sometimes competent people get jobs in it by accident or because there's nothing better going, but generally the best people are all elsewhere. Not a bad thing, as they're probably getting something *done*.

The prepubescent child must be at least five years younger than the adolescent before the attraction can be diagnosed as paedophilia.

His analogy that its like insulting a disabled person to make them stronger. Well 1: Being black isn't a disability, you can't logically compare the two, disabled people suffer in a way black people, despite the Guardian's pretensions, really don't. 2: the kid used the term in a direct question, it's fair enough to quote it in the reply, 3: why isn't he annoyed that the kid used the term? If he wants equal treatment, why does he set different standards for things white and black people can do? Surely if he believes its acceptable for black people to refer to themselves as such, it makes it more acceptable for anyone to refer to them as such?

How many of us can afford it though?

Housing companies aren't daft - they don't build ""unsellable"" homes to maximise profits as the article claims, because homes that don't sell don't generate a profit.

New builds are artificially more expensive because every time a developer puts up a block of flats, the buyers of those flats are required to subsidise the cost of low-income properties for their neighbours.

We put the entire burden of that subsidy on those who are least able to afford it - the first time home-owner.

It's about time that ridiculous system was scrapped and low-cost housing subsidised out of general taxation so that the burden is spread over a wider percentage of the population.

Then you might finally see a situation where a plot of land is only viable as a new build when it is crammed full of tiny flats.",0,1351357982,null,0,false,0,c6sjpug,t3_126ddt,t1_c6sjpug,t3_126ddt,null,1430253008,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Combined with the fact I'm not on Welfare, means it's pointless to discuss the basic cost of living post I made, given that it has nothing whatsoever to do with welfare. The person asked for an example of what people spend their money on, I supplied one. I included the outgoings that for *me* are a necessity.

If I were in receipt of £544 a month combined LHA and JSA, as opposed to the salary I bring home after tax, NI, and Private Pension? Then yes, I'd have a different set of financial priorities. For **me** internet would still be among them, for a variety of reasons, included but not limited to:

* No local libraries near me. Given that people in receipt of JSA are expected to look for work on a regular basis, the lack of local internet access would be a problem.
* The move to Universal Credit, which will be predominately managed online only.
* The saving garnered, via access to online energy tariffs, being able to buy items online at a cheaper rate than offline.
* The educational and entertainment value.

Etc. Etc. But like I said those would be my reasons, where I to find myself in a situation where I was on welfare.

It's only really an issue if you just end up in a long-term contract with people you don't get on with, sometimes language barrier can be a pain, or some people who are just completely insensitive to their surroundings, music in the middle of the night, not cleaning up, rude etc.  Providing you seem to be getting on during the viewing, and maybe go for a drink in the local pub before moving you can generally get a feel of what people are like.

Also never be afraid to ask questions.  Does the shower work properly?  Any issues with the central heating?  Is there parking?  Somewhere to put a bike?  Are the neighbours cool?  What are typical bills like (if not inclusive), how fast is the internet connection?...

People tend to be pretty upfront about things.  Also test water pressure when getting a house anywhere on a hill.  
If there's a garden, ensure you understand how much work will be involved in maintaining it.  Vegetable gardens are great to save money, but are you allowed to help yourself?  How much gardening will you have to do?

Overall, I've had a great experience with house shares.  My only main issues have been shared internet access, where you have the guy that torrents 24/7 meaning you cant do anything without a 3g backup option, and not properly checking how good the English of some housemates were in one place.  Asking them to pay bills or clean up was a giant pain when they don't understand (or pretend not to).",0,1351359358,null,0,false,0,c6sjznt,t3_12642u,t1_c6sjznt,t1_c6sh13y,null,1430253139,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The scapegoats are obvious today: Mbia and the ref. Arteta's goal was blatantly offside. Furthermore, I haven't seen any replays yet, but it seemed that when Hoilett chipped the keeper, it was Zamora who was offside, not Hoilett. 

Mbia. What the *hell* was he thinking? I'm absolutely bloody sick of these stupid red cards. We had *so many* of them last season, so many cheap sending offs, from Diakité's incessant yellow cards to Barton's red-because-it's-Barton against Norwich to Taarabt's ridiculous sending off for toe-poking the ball 10 meters away to Cissé's unnecessary rash tackles that cost us points and contributed to our relegation struggles, something which I'd *very much* like to avoid this year.

And it's not that I really mind losing away against Arsenal. They are very, very good at home; that's not where we should be getting our points. But it's impossible not to be frustrated when we had the draw in our hands, then Mbia gets sent off like that and they get a goal that shouldn't have stood.

6 points against Reading and Soton or we're in trouble *for real*.

You may have heard of some of these concepts named after him: Turing test (and reverse Turing test), Turing completeness, Turing machine.

For a specific example, take the halting problem: given a computer program, determine whether that program will ever halt or continue to run forever.  Turing proved that this is basically impossible: you cannot program a computer in such a way that it can tell you whether any other program will eventually halt or not.  Turing developed things like the Turing machine and also the concept of a decision problem in order to show this, both extremely important concepts today.

&gt;Just my two cents here, but I don’t think the fact he’s a wannabe actor makes him a stooge.

&gt;The show starts by saying that Derren sent out a tweet asking for volunteers for a new, unspecified show.

&gt;A wannabe actor is exactly the type of person who would respond to this sort of thing… If it was another “Miracles for Sale” sort of show, it would be exactly the sort of exposure he’d want.

&gt;His Casting Call Pro profile appears to match up with what we have been told about him—aspires to be an actor, but hasn’t put any work into it. Has done A Level acting, but no further, and his only listed job is as an ensemble player while at college.

&gt;As others have mentioned, the guy in the Zugo’s ad is NOT Steven Brosnan, but Karl Greenwood.

&gt;An awful lot of people have CastingCallPro profiles, it does not make them actors… I have two (one set up in the UK while I was studying drama, one in Canada when I was working with a Christian drama group), today I run a bookshop and am a part time photographer, and have never done a professional acting gig… and yet I have more listed credits than Steve Brosnan does.

I last looked at a selection of new-build houses in 1996. I noticed:

* They seemed to have quite big gardens, but only because the developer had not put up the dividing fences.

* The upper floor joists were on little metal hangers. Some of the houses actually had a design limit on how many people could be upstairs for this reason.

* The interior walls were paper thin with extremely poor sound insulation.

* The roof was built with prefabricated roof trusses which meant that there was no loft space.

* All cupboard and storage space was designed out. 

* The water pipes and wiring were plastered directly into the walls, making any repair work very disruptive.

* The rooms were all very poky.

On one estate, it happened to be pissing down with rain when we visited. Back in the agent's office, I asked why the house was so expensive for its size when an older property seemed to represent much better value. She replied, rather sniffily, that as a new build it was all under warranty which meant that any problems would be dealt with quickly. Just then a resident barged in. ""It's been two weeks now and there's still water coming through my roof. When are you going to get it fixed?""

Nah, I think the commenter 'Luke' nailed it:
Just my two cents here, but I don’t think the fact he’s a wannabe actor makes him a stooge.
The show starts by saying that Derren sent out a tweet asking for volunteers for a new, unspecified show.
A wannabe actor is exactly the type of person who would respond to this sort of thing… If it was another “Miracles for Sale” sort of show, it would be exactly the sort of exposure he’d want.
His Casting Call Pro profile appears to match up with what we have been told about him—aspires to be an actor, but hasn’t put any work into it. Has done A Level acting, but no further, and his only listed job is as an ensemble player while at college.
As others have mentioned, the guy in the Zugo’s ad is NOT Steven Brosnan, but Karl Greenwood.
An awful lot of people have CastingCallPro profiles, it does not make them actors… I have two (one set up in the UK while I was studying drama, one in Canada when I was working with a Christian drama group), today I run a bookshop and am a part time photographer, and have never done a professional acting gig… and yet I have more listed credits than Steve Brosnan does.
Don’t think the inclusion of a CCP profile should be considered definitive, especially in the absence of any evidence that he’s ever done any actual acting before.",0,1351365296,null,0,false,0,c6sl6a1,t3_126lev,t1_c6sl6a1,t3_126lev,null,1430253766,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Again, if goals are all we expect of him, his production has been more than good enough (4g in 8 games is absolutely sufficient).

Probably. 

The point is to find something that prevents abuse.

I'm not saying use the American system, you seem to be saying there's only two possible ways this can be done. You also have to remember that societies differ, and the way the American public fiddle the system and the way Brits do is likely very different.

Don't attack me for simply responding to you. It's not irrelevant and you know it. People will abuse any system, but you can cut down abuse by making it difficult to abuse. The harder it is, the more effort and time it takes to abuse a system, the less people will do it. This is common fucking sense. The system in place at the theme park with time cards was introduce to cut down abuse but still provide the service to those who need it. The same needs to happen everywhere.

I'm typing this to you on a laptop I received from disability benefit. A laptop I needed. But it cost around £500 more than it really needed to. Was there any fucking need for me to have a Macbook Pro? Why not offer something basic that does the same damn job? And why not return them when the course finishes to discourage abuse? It's fucking stupid.

People do deprive their children for cigarettes and drink... Most abusers of the system aren't depriving their children though. They simply go without non-necessities, except cigarettes. Or, they borrow or even steal. Or they have access to more money by abusing the system elsewhere. 

I mentioned to someone else in this read that abusers of the system like the media spotlights certainly do exist, my brother is one of them. I know first hand what a burden on society these people are.

You seem far more emotional about this subject than I. All I've done is be honest and provide my experience and thoughts and you've turned to agressive and irrelevant attacks just because I don't agree with you.

Audio/Video: a lot of the talking parts were very clear, as if done in a studio. Some of the camera angles seemed a bit good considering he shouldn't be able to see any cameras. (I'm not an expert on any of these things so correct me if I'm mistaken)
Finally, in reality it's odd that he didn't just google any of the things, or use a laptop to access the internet.

I'd suggest that as long as your job is secure, and you're not spending more than about 40-50% of your income on rent then I don't see why not. Just control your spending on frivolous things and save money where you can, as insurance in case you lose your job.

I think Moyes has a fair point about wanting the referee to be strong for the derby as I'm sure its a sentiment shared with Liverpool fans but I don't think it's as disrespectful as some of you are making out.

He's obviously deflecting some of the focus away from our poor performances from the last couple of weeks as all managers do but his greivances are fair about the Rodwell sending off.

It was a fair tackle and the reaction of Suarez is what got him sent off in a game in which I felt Everton we're the better side for the opening 20 minutes prior to the red card.

Regarding AJ I feel he's right again as AJ's 'diving' was all the talk at the time much like Suarez is now.

The difference is that Moyes sent a tape of all the decisions to the Head of the Referee's and I think it was either 8 or 9 of the decisions out of 10 should have been penalties.

Obviously I'm not saying he was perfect all the time but its all apart of the mind games that goes with the derby so good luck for tomorrow and as a classic Evertonian I expect a Liverpool win as Neville will undoubtedly start and be raped to death by Allen and Gerrard.",0,1351369667,null,0,false,0,c6sm2c2,t3_126iw7,t1_c6sm2c2,t3_126iw7,null,1430254205,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

With mobile telephony, the virtual circuit isn't fixed in the same way your fixed line home service is. You can drift from one cell to smother when driving or walking. For this reason, I'd imagine it would be difficult for a network to amend the virtual circuit to your location if the call at your end is ceased. Practically, it's also more important to limit the number of active subscribers on each particular cell, because of 'cell breathing' effecting the range of access.

Our garden is a canny size, with patio and a semi-detatched garage. We've also got solar panels for hot water and super dooper insulation! *Thanks building regulations!*

I have noticed that in my friends new build homes, the ceilings are really really low, however in mine, they're just as tall as my mams victorian terrace.

true,lsusobeast,lfcflame,,"Such a shame you maintain his viewpoint, because you seem pretty level-headed. The idea of Liverpool ""conning"" their way to results is flat out silly and disgraceful to even mention. Moyes is just the latest in a long line of managers/players to try and take their shot at Suarez, despite the fact that diving happens by players on virtually every team in the league. What's even more ironic is that the only team who has suffered as a result of Luis' diving recently has been Liverpool. He no longer gets 50/50 decisions and that is something opposing teams should be thrilled about. Stoke rotated the fouler, consistently raping Suarez's legs for 90 minutes without any discipline. 

Furthermore, the idea that Moyes would immediately stamp diving out of one of his players' game is laughable. Diving is a part of South American culture no matter how much we hate it. Suarez's diving has been a part of his game for his whole life, and it is just a tad bit harder to get rid of than saying ""Hey Luis, stay on your feet."" 

Lastly, the idea of banning a player for diving is absolutely absurd. This shit has just gone too far. Trying to trick the ref into giving you a call on offense is no fundamentally different than hacking a player on defense in a way that the ref doesn't see the action. Hell, it isn't too much different than fouling someone on defense and then throwing your hands up in order to say ""I didn't touch him.""

true,Morinaka,null,null,"I'm amazed at what passes for one and two bedroom flats after having looked at some in the last few weeks to help out a relative who needs one.

One bedroom flats are a very mixed bunch but most seems like an after thought, in one of them it had a combined kitchen/lounge (which seems to be a norm now) and the lounge area would be lucky to get a 2 seater sofa and a TV in it, the TV would be next to the fridge, £500 a month; most of these places would be better called bedsits with an extra wall. One of the two bedroom places i viewed was a joke, it had 4 rooms total in it for £750 a month, it had a combined kitchen/lounge with the door to the bathroom opposite the kitchen in the lounge, like 4 foot away from the kitchen with the toilet just inside the door, you'll certainly have no privacy whatsoever when going to the toilet. That place would have made a nice one bedroom flat but you couldn't get £750 a month for it that way.

The big advantage to new builds (regardless of shit design or not) is that they are much cheaper to run, walking into a flat conversion of various old houses and they are freezing cold, walk into a new build and it's warm and barely requires any heating. I live in a new build and 15 minutes of heating is all it takes to make the place borderline uncomfortably warm. Fixtures are generally good and up to standard but the fitting was average at best.

The biggest issues i've seen are the lack of storage as mentioned in the article, fucking weird rooms shapes, seriously whoever designed these places didn't think about furniture, just make places with square or rectangular rooms not L shaped and angled monstrosities that make putting anything in them a pain in the arse.

Oddly the best flats in my area that i've seen are all built by the local housing association(s?), a friend of mine has a new build HA place that is very well built and miles better than the crap i've been viewing, his one bed flat puts most of the two bed ones i've viewed to shame.",0,1351375440,null,0,false,0,c6sn9d2,t3_126ddt,t1_c6sn9d2,t3_126ddt,null,1430254749,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

I also don't like the fact that bikes have to adhere to the traffic lights at pedestrian crossings. Don't get me wrong, if there are lights at a junction and it wouldn't be advisable to go through a red, but as it is bikes are forced to stop and accelerate again every minute, creating more of a nuisance for the cars behind. This again emphasises the need for an exclusive cycle lane.

Other than that though, I find most car drivers friendly around the city, with a few rather bad exceptions. A lot of people need to learn how to use their indicators.

In the first series, he seemed (to me at least) to be very much in control. The cracks started to appear a little in the Christmas special and a lot during the last series. This final episode was brutal and, though I thought it might be great to see him get nailed to the wall after last week's episode, his monologue with Ollie and him desperately running from the press was quite sad. What a great character. 

Also, I've never liked Ollie very much, but I thought it was great that he would be the one to step into Malcolm's shoes (or try to, anyway). Very fitting for him. 

And Glenn! I loved his take down of Ollie last week and this ep was 10x better. ""I'm going to lamp you... with a lamp!""

true,cavalier_hat,null,null,"Hey, fellow aussie living in Edinburgh here :)

Don't worry, I was terrified about the wet weather thing too when I first moved here, but it's actually not too bad. There are a few essentials.

First I would say sturdy winter boots. Wellies are a great option as they are quite cheap and waterproof. But for just walking around, these are what I wear (You may be able to find cheap options on other websites).

http://uk.thenorthface.com/tnf-uk-en/women-s/shop-by-category/footwear-shoes/women-s-nuptse-faux-fur-iv-49898.html

Secondly you need a winter jacket/coat. Long coats are preferable for cold days (down to your knees) and make sure its thick material. But for when its raining, a hooded waterproof jacket with a fleece inside is fine. (Wearing a poncho over your clothing may be cheap and waterproof, but it will instantly mark you out as a tourist)

So thats shoes and coats covered. You will also need scarves, gloves, hats (you ears will be freezing!) and sweaters. Honestly, the trick to winter here is layers. You will be fine.

Oh, and thick mens hiking socks. Loads of them! Mens ones seem to be thicker and of better quality. You can never have too many socks. I hope all that helps, and if you want any more advice about anything, just message me.
