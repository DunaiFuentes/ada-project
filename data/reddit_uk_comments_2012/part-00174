Applications that can immediately be assumed to be from an English speaking person will probably go to the top of the pile. They will be called back first.

I imagine something like this could be at the root of this?

Also, I do not know if this is the same everywhere, but I know some people will associate misspelling of 'normal' names (Jordan &gt; Jorden) with stupid people.

Did anyone actually read the article?  I'd like to highlight the following:

&gt;""Mrs Saldanha ... answered the telephone because it was 05:30 GMT in the morning and there was no receptionist on duty.""

&gt;""Mrs Saldanha ... was the person who answered the call from the Australian DJs and **was not the nurse who discussed the duchess's medical condition**.""

&gt;""In the call, **another nurse** was tricked into revealing specific confidential information about the duchess's medical condition."" 

(ie not *this* nurse)

&gt;""The BBC understands Mrs Saldanha had not been suspended or disciplined by the hospital.""

&gt;""A palace spokesman later added that ""at no point did the palace complain to the hospital about the incident"".""

So, not only was she not even the nurse who divulged the information to the DJs, she simply answered her phone and passed the call on, but she was never in any trouble and the Royal family never complained. 

So, if the DJs are responsible, how come the nurse *who actually spoke to them* hasn't killed herself. 

I suggest that there were actually underlying reasons for this poor woman committing suicide, and those reasons are the ones that should be investigated and addressed rather than the demonisation of a pair of entertainers, simply for the fact that they're an easy target.

In the UK, when we graduate, we work 2 years as a junior doctor rotating around departments. Minimum salary is ~22.5k ATM, and you also get banding depending on what hours you work (+0%, +30%, +40% or +50%). 

We pay back 9% of how much we earn that's over the repayment threshold towards loans. So the threshold for Scottish students is the 15.8k, and if I earn, let's say, 27k in my first year before tax, then 9% of (27k-15.8k) is what I'll pay back over the year. (This is assuming an even monthly salary, as it's actually based on your salary per month as opposed to per year). You do this until the loan is paid off. You can make extra voluntary payments to help pay it off quicker.

As a Scottish student, the government subsidise my tuition fees at medical school, so my loan (you also get a bursary that replaces part of the loan depending on your household income, nothing for high ones, a few grand for low ones) covers academic maintenance and living costs. My loan is £2,870 per year. At the end of it all, I'll have to repay the loan amount, which'll be about £10-14k, based on the scheme above.

Medical school is either 5 or 6 years here, depending on where you go and if you choose to take a year out to gain an additional bachelor's degree in a medically related science/art. The final year of medical school is subsidised by the Scottish Government Health Directorate who pay your tuition for that year and give you a means-tested bursary for maintenance, you're also eligible for another loan, that'd add to the amount you have to pay back.

Time is a delicate thing; one of the fundamental rules is that you can't do something one way and then go back and do it a second. Not only would you still be there doing it the first time, but you risk creating a paradox, which is damaging.

Some companions have left, and the Tenth Doctor did revisit all of them while holding back his regeneration, though didn't interact with most; only watching from a distance because of the risk of affecting their timeline.

The problem in Manhattan is that all of the time jumps the Angels sent people on created a lot of distortions, rendering time travel to that period difficult (hence the TARDIS bouncing off 1938 the first time). The TARDIS barely got there the first time. It's the same universe; parallel universes are a different phenomenon.

That's coupled with the fact that Amy and Rory created a paradox by having Rory die differently to how they saw the first time. The rest of their timeline was set when they were sent back again, and going back for them would have risked creating a second paradox and destroying New York.

true,ApolloDeus,ni,Northern Ireland,"I went on it after being on escitalopram for several years.  While the escitalopram was my wonder drug that pretty much cleared up my depression and anxiety, the sexual side effects were becoming increasingly frustrating so the doctor tried me on the mirtazapine.  Same as you, it knocked me out for several days but it did nothing at all for my depression.  With every increase in dosage, my depression and anxiety has gotten worse and suicidal ideation - which was never a huge part of my depression - has become pretty much constant.

Although, unlike people who are actually suicidal, I don't want to die and have no plans whatsoever to kill myself.  The thoughts are just there, and they freak me out... which leads me to believe it's coming from the drug and not me, so I'm in the process of coming off mirtazapine and back onto escitalopram so I can get my life back.  

As for the sexual side effects of SSRIs, I was hardly the worst affected - I just lasted forever, and that's not necessarily a bad thing, even though it was frustrating at times.  I'd rather have my life back, though, so at least for the meantime I'm happy enough with escitalopram.

That doesn't make what the radio DJs did acceptable. People shouldn't have to be suspicious of each other all the time because of radio DJs 'prank' calling people. When you are playing it live on the radio it shouldn't be called a prank call, it should be a crime. 

I doubt that this person was all happy and well beforehand but, I can easily imagine something like this tipping someone who is already depressed over the edge (I get depressed and can imagine it tipping me over the edge and certainly at least leaving me thinking about suicide on a bad day). I don't think whether she killed herself partly because of the radio 'prank' call or not changes the fact that what the radio DJs did was wrong, it just shows the harm it does to some of the people involved more clearly. As well as the harm it might well have done to both of the nurses on the phone, it is also very unfair on the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Clearly, they deserve to be left alone while the Duchess is ill.

1) because people are unfairly laying the blame of this poor woman's suicide at the door of the Australian DJs. Ridiculous. 

2) because no one is reading the fucking article that they are then commenting on. 

I'd like to highlight the following:

&gt;""Mrs Saldanha ... answered the telephone because it was 05:30 in the morning and there was no receptionist on duty.""

&gt;""Mrs Saldanha ... was the person who answered the call from the Australian DJs and **was not the nurse who discussed the duchess's medical condition**.""

&gt;""In the call, **another nurse** was tricked into revealing specific confidential information about the duchess's medical condition."" 

(ie not *this* nurse)

&gt;""The BBC understands Mrs Saldanha had not been suspended or disciplined by the hospital.""

&gt;""A palace spokesman later added that ""at no point did the palace complain to the hospital about the incident"".""

So, not only was she not even the nurse who divulged the information to the DJs, she simply answered her phone and passed the call on, but she was never in any trouble and the Royal family never complained. 

So, if the DJs are responsible, how come the nurse *who actually spoke to them* hasn't killed herself. 

I suggest that there were actually underlying reasons for this poor woman committing suicide, and those reasons are the ones that should be investigated and addressed rather than the demonisation of a pair of entertainers, simply for the fact that they're an easy target.

No, but the attention is because of public enjoyment. And the public attention can't help but be invasive, even if on an individual level the interest and the actions are completely reasonable.

That's not how probabilities work.

You can consider a number of possible realities to create a population from which to determine the rate at which realities created by means other than a deity exist; but you're just fabricating data. There is only one reality that we have direct awareness of. If we could measure the deity value directly we'd find it was 1 and so the chance of God existing would be 1. I'm going to guess you'd disagree on the expected result - but that disagreement isn't based on science.

I noticed from the reports that the woman is not being sentenced until a medical report has been completed. I imagine this will show her to be of sufficiently poor mental health not to be held responsible for her own actions. She probably suffered years of mental and/or physical abuse from her husband that was more the cause of what happened than any religious factor.

But, hey, the damage is done, the headline writers have blamed the Quran in another piece of wonderfully balanced reporting and that's what will stick in everyone's minds about this case.

true,Quazz,capaldi,Capaldi,"Fixed time means that all the events transpired in said time slot can never be altered.

So, for example, if in that fixed time they meet the Doctor at one point, then the Doctor MUST go there or otherwise time would ""die"". Fixed points can never be altered at their core, although the details can be changed (such as in Waters of Mars or Fires of Pompeii and arguably also the Impossible Astronaut)

The reason the Doctor can't go back to visit them is because he never did beyond that one time (when Amy was a kid on the night she waited) from Amy and Rory's perspective and thus he never will, because he can't. 

If Amy and Rory had, on the other hand, experienced more adventures than the Doctor had at that point in time, then the Doctor would have been obligated to spend more time with them and do those adventures.

Alas, they had not and thus they are separated forever from the Doctor. As far as we know, anyway.

&gt;For example, old companions, some died, some got old, but the doctor could theoretically always re-visit them if he misses them..but he never does, doesn't it?

Most of that time is in flux and as long as it doesn't mess up the timelines, it's fine. If he were to introduce himself as the Doctor before they had met the Doctor it would change his own timeline in an unpredictable manner that could have severe unforeseen consequences. This is why he attempts to avoid crossing his own timeline. Cheap tricks are fine as they don't change anything meaningful.

&gt;What I don't get and bothers me is that the doctor never seems to meet with himself [ maybe it happened but I'm a new fan, just watched the last 3 seasons and it never did ] and whenever smth bad happens i think to myself, why don't you go back and fix it?

This hasn't so much to do with fixed time as with established events as well as crossing his own timeline.

&gt;...there has been a surge of interest at the idea of creating a Doctor Who parody version at Gallifrey One

And it should probably stay there as this practice of making a cover or parody of anything popular is extremely cliche and trite. It's even worse when you combine things that just have no business being combined.

He wants desperately to take a drugs holiday but his cd4 count has been under 100 for many years. Obviously this didnt make much sense and he wouldnt just go ahead and do it without consulting his consultants. 

These videos are compelling to be honest. They raise issues that are taboo but I dont think they offer any real alternatives. 

A quick overview for those that arent familiar:

-The CDC needed funding so developed a test that would trigger in men with weakened immune systems 

-Immune systems were being weakened by lifestyle explicitly the use of poppers

-Robert Gallo patented the test and earns $1 per test, good money and a money earner for the US

-There is no gold standard HIV test, and test from state to state and country to country will reveal different results

-The HIV virus has never been isolated, it sort of has but not to a standard that meets kochs postulate. 

-AIDS was caused by high dosage AZT, a chemotherapy drug, those emaciated figures of AIDS patients were effectively caused by doctors misprescribing AZT. 

-HIV is benign and doesnt lead to Aids. 

-Some people have stopped using anti-retrovirals and instead of getting sick have actually got better and their immune systems have strengthened

I may have missed a few bits out

The main protagonists espousing these ideas are group of aids denialists called the Perth group (who were prevented from challenging the health industry in court due to not being considered subject matter experts) and a virus specialist named peter duesberg. There was an activist called Christine Maggiore who stopped taking medication and died.

The Citizens' Advice Bureau is one place, they're really good for impartial advice on benefits etc., but perhaps more importantly they know what other help is available, such as that from charities.

If you're religious, then take the big step of going and introducing yourself at your local church or other place of worship. You're likely to find people there who will be helpful, considerate and sympathetic.

Maybe you feel cut off from the home-school network, but I'd suggest making contact. They'll know about how best to tackle things like writing a CV which demonstrates your academic and more general skills accurately, whereas the JobCentre people probably won't have a clue about home schooling.

But to gain legal meaning, you go to a secular office that marries everyone. 

Religious ceremonies shouldn't have an effect on how someone is viewed legally. A religious marriage should mean as little to the law as a bar mitzvah, a jewish boy isn't considered an adult by the law just because he turned 13 and took part in a ceremony. 

You can still *have* your religious ceremonies, you just need to fucking stop other people having theirs and stop expecting them to have special meaning outside of your religion.

* make sure you are getting all the benefits you are entitled too - moneysavingexpert.com has a section on this, and many other things. -  that will help out with getting a job, socailising and so on.

* get registered on the electoral roll. It gives you proof of address that you might need for many other things. Google for your local council and their website should tell you how. credit, mortgages and so on use it to assess you, so it's worth doing, even if you never intend to vote.

* get registered with a GP and dentist. Google for  these too, there's tons of NHS info out there.

for socializing, you do some with work colleagues, or you take up hobbies and meet people there. Basically, to develop social skills - ask questions. What people do outside work, what family they have, where they live and so on, and then follow those up. Voila, basics of conversation. Then when you see them again, you can ask how family/area/hobby/life etc is going, and on goes conversation. Like any skill, you need to practice it to be good.

the job market in the uk at the moment is hard, so it's going to take some work, - but London in particular has a decent job demand even so. Job wise, there is a huge variety out there you can do, from manual labour work to supermarket shelf stacking, office jobs and and so on.

He's extremely solid in possession, has one of the highest pass completion rates (3rd behind Terry and Cahill), is always making himself available for the pass (as evidenced by him getting more touches than anyone on the team by a fair margin) and is the key player in a possession based philosophy.

He gets a good amount of tackles in (3rd equal with Azpi), tops the team with Luiz in interceptions, but also plays the role of CDM with lots of awareness, which is probably best illustrated by him giving away 29 fouls but only picking up 3 yellows. Using fouls to break up counters, and without gaining cards, is one of the dark arts of a CDM that's hard to gauge but makes a world of difference.

His ability to win aerial duels is actually reasonable as well, only Terry and Cahill are clearly more effective.

Similar to the average person in the street, the average person in the church is perfectly happy/ambivalent/apathetic to homosexuals getting married.

It seems that most Christians are decent, caring &amp; fair minded individuals and are willing to allow gays to marry in their places of worship, particularly if the gays in question consider themselves to be part of that religious community.

The reason you ask the question you do is because you're hearing the reactionary 'anti-gay' types. This is understandable, after all they're the most vocal. But they don't realise how many gays are also Christians. Of course, depending on which part of the bible you read it 'stands to reason' that gays wouldn't want to be Christians: ""Stone those men who lie with other men"" etc. But you have to remember that gay Christians are just like all the other Christians: they *pick and choose bits of the bible. They have to.

For the majority of Christians in the UK, the Jesus said ""Love your neighbour"" aspect is far more important than the other mumblings in the book. Quite right too.

I had just qualified as a car mechanic and I was applying for jobs as a small percentage minority: I was a man who had hair down to the bottom of the shoulders! Apart from retail the only job I could get with it was as a pizza delivery driver for Dominos, which was barely enough to cover fuel and rent.

I was totally unsuccessful after months of looking for a garage job, seemingly only because people just didn't want to know because I looked like a metal head. 

I was at a family funeral a few months later and my uncle was there. He founded an electrical company and also bought an aluminum window company, he now is chairman of both. He suggested I get a hair cut to be more employable, his attitude was: ""it's not right but it's the way it is, businesses judge your looks"". I rationalised that society labels people because it takes less imagination... 

So I got my hair cut and now I am 4 months in as a minimum wage estimator for the aluminum window company. But the hair was definitely an identity thing for me and I am still coming to terms with being conned out of it to run in a wheel, with Radio 2 piped in the office 9 hours a fucking day....

&gt;has one of the highest pass completion rates 

I have no problem with that, but 99.9% of all those passes are back-passes or short side-way passes. I guess what I'm trying to say is, for me, he doesn't do anything productive enough with these passes. 


Compare him to say, Essien in his day, and you'll see what I'm talking about. That's how I'd want my DMs to be. Compare him to any good DMs (Alonso, Khedira, Yaya, Scott Parker even) and you'll see the difference. He's been around for a long, long time now and he really should have developed into a more well-rounded and complete player by now.

true,huracan_6,null,null,"I am going to have to disagree with you a little bit.  In the claims that you make in your response you basically say that the big drain on US healthcare is big pharma.  That is simply not true.  Many people make that mistake but it is something that I think people need to know.  The truth is that it merely seems like the majority of a dollar spend on healthcare is spent on prescription drugs, when in reality it is a significantly smaller portion.

This misunderstanding stems from the way that we are charged for our healthcare.  [This image](http://www.kaiseredu.org/~/media/Images/EDU/Issue%20Modules/Health%20Expenditures.jpg) shows the actual percentages of each dollar spent on healthcare.  From that we see that only ten percent of one dollar spend on healthcare is spent on prescription drugs.  The problem is that insurance covers most of the other stuff on that list, and the out of pocket expense is very different.  From what I recall, roughly ninety percent of out of pocket expense is spent on prescription drugs.  If it was flipped and everything was payed for evenly then prescription drugs would look much more affordable than they are.  Especially considering the fact that by staying on drugs that you need, you can stay out of the hospitals and reduce your overall healthcare expenditures.

Lastly, from the article that I linked at the end of my post, they list a few drivers of healthcare cost.  Their first one is laughable when you look at that chart and think about the fact that if someone has a chronic disease and stays on their medicine it could lower their trips to the hospital and thus spend less money.  That said, their last one refers to administrative costs.  Approximately seven percent of the dollar is spent on administrative costs.  This is almost as much as the cost of the drugs.  

Now that I have talked about the reason why I think big pharma is not a driver of healthcare costs, I have another point to make.  By negotiating costs and driving prescription drug costs down, we would be destroying innovative pharmaceuticals.  The amount of money it takes to discover, patent, go through animal trials, go through human trials, file with the FDA, and then finally go to market on an innovative drug is really really ridiculously high.  GSK states that it takes about 800 million to develop a drug, I have heard higher and lower depending on a lot of circumstances.  The thing about that is number is that companies do not only pay for drugs that they end up getting to market, they also pay for drugs that they research and that fail in clinical trials.  Then, due to the way patenting of drugs works, after the drug hits the market they have about eight years between launch and the patent ending.  That means they have eight years to recoup their losses and make money to drive further innovative medicine, before generics can make the drug for pennies.  By trying to lower drug prices we would stifle innovation in medicine and we would never find cures or treatments for diseases that people have.  I truly believe that pharma companies, though they are there to make a profit, also are there to help save lives and make a difference.  

[This picture (the one in the article)](http://www.curesam.com/2011/11/14/happy-birthday-dr-banting/) shows a child who received life saving insulin.  In just two months he gained 14 pounds due to innovative drugs.  Do we really want to stifle this sort of business, one that can really make a difference in someone's life?

He is a very physical guy in the midfield and you rarely see him get fun off the ball and is able to muscle guys off of it.  I have always thought he has done a great job in dictating the tempo of the game, especially against Arsenal and Spurs where he was a straight boss.

I think what most people get caught up on, is at times this season, when Luiz or Lampard would wander forward, he would be in positions where he was doing the defensive work of three people and he would be able to shut the counter down.

Basically this is why she is my favorite companion, I think some people have the opinion that Rose was annoying because she constantly wandered off, relied on the Doctor to save her, and because she showed a lot of jealousy because she was in love with him. I like how curious Rose was, she tried to comprehend everything and (although many people see this as one of her biggest character flaws) she was not afraid to wander off in awe of what she was experiancing and try and get the best experiance she could meeting people and seeing everything she could of where The Doctor took her. She was also a key part of The Doctors development, in regard to showing him how to love and express emotion again. She fixed The Doctor and gave him a huge sense of comfort, and I definitely think she had the right to fall in love with him, and I'm very glad that The Doctor reciprocated that love, as it made a very enjoyable and heart wrenching sub-plot. Her two seasons were my favorite, they involved lots of plot development and the love story to me was a brilliant addition. I loved Tennant and Piper.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The question of stifling innovation is reasonable, but that can easily be fixed by government subsidization of research. One could counter-argue that paying for the research just means we are paying for the drugs in a different way, but you could come out ahead by decreasing the costs on the back end by funding the front end research. 

For example, Atorvastatin, a great (possibly the best statin) made $125 billion dollars during it's post-NDA to patent-expiration period. Considering that pharmaceutical companies bring in billions of USD in profits every year, they can afford to charge less for specific medications. If pfizer is making ~$4b USD in profits annually even after Lipitor went generic, they could do just as well with $3b in profits. 

The other problem in the US is that we don't refuse to buy drugs from big pharma that are poor in a cost-benefit analysis. Take Zytiga, a medication for prostate cancer. It costs 3k british pounds per month for treatment, but only increases life expectancy for 4 months (14 months vs. 10 months without). Doesn't save your life, just delays the inevitable at a cost of 12k pounds. There is a new biologic anti-cancer medication coming out for a very rare and agressive type of cancer that costs $6k per month to administer, and doubles life expectancy (from 9 to 18months vs placebo. (Note: I'm being vague about the drug, the maker, and what it treats on purpose). That's paying $54k for an average patient to still die. 

Of course, pharma HAS to make these drugs. Perphaps the cure for said type of cancer will be based on this new biologic agent, and if it were never made, you aren't any closer to understanding the disease process.

My proposal is this: Socialize the research (tax payer funding, which we already do to a large extent on diseases that big pharma refuses to research because there isn't a profit there [Orphan Drug Act]), and also socialize the profits (by making the drugs cheaper). You tell pfizer that the US will give grants for it's clinical trials after they file their IND, but they must sell the drug to patients at a reasonable cost. The best part of this system would be that independent pharmaceutical corporations that don't have the funds to do clinical tries after isolating a lead compound could get grants just as easily as Merck, Pfizer, Genentech, Rosche, etc which would increase competition.

- The red dragon symbolizes Kilgarrah, Christianity, Wales and King Arthur. It is the 'New Religion'. 

- The white dragon symbolizes Aithusa, Paganism, Magic, Morgana and the Saxons. It is the 'Old Religion'.

In a way, Merlin supports Aithusa and what the white dragon symbolizes. Merlin is part of the Old Religion, of Paganism and magic. He has similar powers to Morgana and can in a sense sympathize with her. To destroy Aithusa is to destroy Merlin's heritage. Part of him wants Aithusa to succeed and grow up to defeat Kilgarrah. He wants a land where magic can be free, but in legend Camelot does not offer that. 

You could argue this is at the back of his mind. He is not completely on Arthur's side, just like he isn't completely on Morgana's side. He is caught in the middle - **until the ultimate plot point of his magic gets revealed to Arthur.** It is at this crucial stage that we see the direction the BBC wanted to take this show. 

In modern legend, Arthur accepts Merlin's magic. Merlin becomes the 'court wizard' who pulls Arthur out of all manner of problems. This is shown by author's such as T.H White.

Yet in older legends, or pseudo-history, it is unclear. Arthur stood for something (Christianity) that Merlin ultimately did not. 

In the TV show itself, they are actually at odds. Arthur's father despises magic and it is magic that is responsible for the death of Arthur's mother.

It will be interesting to see what they choose. ",0,1354932875,null,0,1354933463,0,c7d0zdo,t3_14dug8,t1_c7d0zdo,t3_14dug8,null,1430610793,3,false,merlinbbc,t5_2s3xe,3

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"I'd be interested to know who those sects are, and who is denying them the ability to perform those ceremonies.

Regardless, your counterpoint doesn't answer the core issue. Whether legally binding or not, people are going to want some ceremony and pomp for their weddings. Even if it were justified to do something like that (and it isn't) people who believe the exact opposite of what any church preaches can get married in that church. Atheists and Agnostics are happily wed in the house of God, and yet this one small sect is denied what even the anathema of organised religion is given. Does that not seem unfair to you? 

I couldn't find a reliable source for what percentage of couples wed in a registry and what percentage wed in some kind of ceremony (not to mention the imminent small percentages doing it in some other, lesser-practiced ways) but deciding that weddings can't be legally binding purely because they happened in a church won't fix the issue. It'll mean the churches will still carry on wedding everyone else, and the Homosexual couples will look at all that joy and all that pomp and all that happiness...as they sit in a stuffy office with a 40-something woman, waiting to sign a slip of paper, in clothing they might wear to a job interview.

Imagine going to a restaurant and seeing everyone else tucking into delicious-looking meals. Steaks, Racks of Ribs, Lobster, Salmon, rare delicacies and steaming platters of sides and vegetables, salads and fruits that look so fresh and delicious they make your mouth water, desserts that look like they belong in an art gallery and, going on people's reactions, taste like they came right from heaven itself, and then being told that at this restaurant, you and you alone can only eat bread. It could be the best bread in the world, but it's still bread. That's the equivalent of your proposal, because even if implimented, the church would keep on doing what it's doing, and it's attitude would never change. That's the fantastic stupidity of this issue. A group of people who are so set in specific beliefs that they will move mountains to defend them even against people who have never considered threatening those beliefs, and who desire nothing more than to be happy without harming or infringing upon anyone else. 

Sadly, we have reached a point where Religion has to be told, if not by it's own members then by the law, that it is not okay to discriminate, because I'd bet a lung that if the situation were reversed, then Christians everywhere would be up in arms about it, and rightly so.

If religion and marriage are going to stay intertwined, and the basic desire of peoples dictates that they should, then we can either sacrifice the egos of a few old men who plod about wearing silly hats and dresses telling everyone what terrible things are going to happen if they don't quietly submit to their rule. Or. We can sacrifice the happiness of a not meaningless part of our society which is already beset by hatred by specific peoples and groups. 

Frankly I think it's high time religion got a bloodied nose. It doesn't even have to just be Christianity either. Islam is also massively against homosexuality, to the point where homosexuality is a crime in 76 countries according to an article by The Independent and is punishable by death in seven*.

It doesn't take some grand restructuring of the legal definition of marriage, nor the stripping of legal binding the marriages performed in churches. All it takes is a swift kick up the arse to people who apparantely believe themselves capable of judging entire sects of humanity, while simultaniously being told judge not, lest ye be judged+.

true,TinyZoro,cnty-england,England,I think you're missing the point. I enjoyed your comment it was sincere and then it derailed in an amusing way. However I think JB_UK was making a point about how we've all become so inoculated to news as a source of mild amusement we disconnect from thinking about this as real people - two kids and a father who've lost their mum. Two radio journalists who've seen the bottom fall out of their joke. A bunch of colleagues who've lost a friend. Elderly parents who've lost their daughter. Some middle manager in the NHS who now regrets the dressing down he gave her. The point is in the real world stuff means something it is not just a fake shock in the news cycle or a bit of a lol here. That dosent make your comment wrong. What I like about Reddit is that there is a constant unexpected change of tone or pace.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"Maybe my ability to think clearly is clouded by the late time of night, but I'm feeling optimistic! Derby have won the last seven games against us, but with us ending the Tuesday night, Leicester at home *and* Huddersfield away hoodoo, I think that we could genuinely see a reversal of fortune at Pride Park. I'm going to predict a **2-1 win for Leeds**.

I still can't see us keeping a clean sheet - especially as Derby seem to have a knack for getting a goal or two (Robinson in particular has a good turn of pace), though I think that their problem has been not conceding more than a goal or two. If we can win the midfield battle like we have been doing, then we'll definitely be in business. I just hope that our players don't look at the respective records of Derby and ourselves and get all arrogant.

I can see him keeping the same team, if at all possible. Diouf seems doubtful to be on the bench, let alone start, so McCormack will surely get a run in the side now, while the only other possible change I could think of is Hall in for Thomas. Hall was terrific against Huddersfield, while I've heard of one or two doubts over Thomas's fitness, so it will be interesting to see how it goes, although I'd naturally prefer the same 11 to start. However, I am delighted with the fact that we seem able to replace one dangerous winger with another!

Here's hoping for Green to get a goal against his former club, too!",0,1354933726,null,0,false,0,c7d163g,t3_14gspg,t1_c7d163g,t3_14gspg,null,1430610866,3,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,3

true,Acutuse,null,null,"The Doctor is a Galifreyan, a member of an alien race biologically resembling humans in most cases, but with the notable exception of having two hearts.  He is represented in this image in his 11th form (not really important if you don't follow, think Freeza in DBZ but actually cool.  Given you are 12, I expect this reference to catch, but calm down and let's keep going).  Now the chap on the right in this image is an imagining of the Hyrulian hero of legend, Link.  This las was born with 3 hearts, and every time he kills a really fierce beast he acquires its heart and adds it to his own collection.  He also occaisionally manages to find pieces of powerful hearts cached by his forebearers.  Sometimes just lying around, other times hidden in wooden boxes on cliffs or under bushes only found when they are burnt.  Frankly that seems to indicate Hyrulians are  weird, but that's another discussion.  Now the curious aspect of this is that Link. whenever injured loses a quarter or more of a heart, sometimes as many as 4 hearts in one blow.  Say what you will, the man has a capacity for pain.  Fortunately his health can be regenerated by eating the hearts of any common creature one might find in any old mysterious woods; nutritious.  Back to the image, our man Link here appears to be an adventurous lad or has managed to beat a good number of baddies and collected their hearts.  The argument at present is unknown, but based on the gesticulaiouns of our two subjects, the Doctor thought it prudent to inform Link he has two hearts, to which point Link was simply not amused.

Or possibly a 4-2-3-1 with Huddlestone and Sandro holding and Dembele just slightly infront of them. That would give us a brick wall in the midfield to deal with Fellaini and company. 

Obviously Adebayor in there because it's going to be an absolute scrap fest, and he's been on pretty good form when he's played (goal against the Greeks and Gunners) besides from the red card obviously.

This would also work a lot better if we had Parker for Huddlestone. Don't think that's going to happen though, unless he makes a surprise appearance off the bench.

The problem with counting the number of people with AIDS in places like Africa is because of costs they use a diagnostic test. That test asks if they are suffering from a multitude of ailments such as dehydration, diarrhoea, sickness, vomiting and a tonne of other thing. If the person ticks a good eight of those symptoms they can be classified as having AIDS. There is no blood test done on these people. Now the issue comes that many of these symptoms can equally be prescribed to a horrible diet, lack of access to clean water and a tonne of other medical problems. 

This is not to say that many do not have AIDS or not, as they have not been diagnosed in the way that they would in the developed world. In fact the estimates for the number of people who have it have been revised down quite a bit over the years I believe. 

It is not a case of duping more a case of using flawed assessments to measure the incidence of the problem.

true,LAXLuther,null,null,"&gt; People kill themselves all the time. How do you know you've never done something in your life at some time, no matter how small, and that's led to someone taking their own life? 
 
My work!  I'm a counsellor, specialising in grief. I've dealt with people for whom such incidents can be hugely damaging.  You don't have to be a ""mental case"" to commit suicide.  Incidents like these could provoke something in a person's unconscious life.  And If they are unable to deal with it, or find someone to help them, it could lead to suicide.  

It's not about the ""small"" incident, it's about how personal the victim takes the incident, and how deeply it affects their inner life.   

We're not all the same.  There are people that don't find pranks like this funny.  It's embarrassing, humiliating and deeply painful for them.  It leaves them exposed and vulnerable.  And that can come as a big shock, so much so that they don't know how to deal with it.  

And that was my original point.  People whom say she probably had other issues, makes it sound like she either had mental health problems or couldn't handle whatever else was happening in her life, and then this drove her over the edge.  She simply may have been a person with a personality that found an event like this too damaging, too painful.  That doesn't mean she has a mental disorder, or that this combined with whatever was happening in her life pushed her over the edge.   



&gt; I also enjoy how you don't like other people speculating on what may have been happening in her life, but you feel perfectly qualified to tell us how she may have felt.

So I should just sit by and watch how other people speculate and not do anything about it?  Watch how their default is to insinuate that she probably had other issues.  I'm speculating like everyone else, because that is all we can do.  I'm presenting a counter argument.  I resent the fact that people always associate suicidal behaviour with mental illness, which is why I feel so strongly about it. 

And it is not that I don't like other people speculate about what may have happened in her life.  It's about the narrow mindedness of their speculation.   ",0,1354954517,null,0,false,0,c7d56mb,t3_14g0it,t1_c7d56mb,t1_c7czfb0,null,1430612766,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

This whole issue is a non issue when you look at the underlying fundamentals.

Since the beginning, there were two visions of Europe.

The first, the UK's... of free trade.
The second, of Germany (and France)... of Federalisation.

As recently as 2007-08, there was still an open door for both visions, depending on who would seize the initiative.

However, with the oncoming of the financial crisis, the initial reaction of the core in the Eurozone has been to aggressively push for closer integration. 

This subsequent loss of sovereignty, and submission into what is effectively, a Greater Germany, would never ever wash in the UK. I am not convinced that it will wash in France either...

My tip for 2013, watch Germany and France's relationship... It looks almost Shakespearian in how they are staying united but positioning against each other at the same time.

Anyway, I digress.

TLDR: Two competing visions for Europe. UK (free trade)/ Germany (superstate). German vision has won in the midst of 'crisis'. As Europe pushes closer together into one entity, no way that UK will join up. 

It is not a case of us wanting to be IN. Its a case of if they want us in if we are not committed to the full package.

It's amazing. Don't expect any cliché spy action, it's totally going for the realistic approach, which involves a lot of Westminster politics, and well, desk jobs. Understandably, these more realistic agents are not that keen to die to keep politicians in power, or to help minor Soviet defectors escape to the West. 

Nearly everything is done in dialogue, with only one or two scenes of 'location action'. But if you can appreciate that, it's a very intense show. Characters will actually die, and things rarely work out as you might expect from a mid century ITC spy show.

&gt;I'd be interested to know who those sects are, and who is denying them the ability to perform those ceremonies.

For example, the Quakers and the reform Jews. Both of these sects are absolutely fine with people being gay and they wish to perform marriage ceremonies for the gay members of their congregations.

It is currently illegal for them to do so. Under current English law you cannot perform a marriage ceremony in a religious building for a gay couple. 

To make it absolutely clear. I want this to change so that *if* a church *wants* to perform a marriage ceremony for a gay, or any other couple, then they are free to do so.

&gt;Whether legally binding or not, people are going to want some ceremony and pomp for their weddings.

Again, as I have already clearly said, you can have all the fucking pomp and ceremony you want. How are you interpreting anything that I've said as meaning that you wont be allowed to have a ceremony?

The rest of your comment again seems to be implying that I want to prevent people from marrying in a church with a ceremony. I'll try to make it as simple as possible. My proposed changes would mean the following.

* Religious ceremonies can be carried out by any religion.
* Those religious ceremonies can be carried out for anyone.
* Those ceremonies have no legal standing.
* For a legally binding marriage you go to a registry office.
* YOU CAN DO BOTH

Please read that last point again, then a third time. No one is getting anything taken away. If you just want a civil union, just get a civil union. If you want pomp and ceremony, have a huge wedding in a church and then later on you can have it legally recognised. If you want, have two religious weddings. One catholic and one jewish for all I fucking care. 

I repeat yet again. 

Currently it is illegal for ANY religion in England to perform a religious marriage ceremony for a gay couple. 

I propose to allow religious sects to perform gay marriages IF THEY WISH TO DO SO.

I propose that a religious marriage ceremony have as little legal standing as a bar mitzvah or bat mitzvah. Judaism isn't whining that jewish children aren't legally recognised as adults just because their religious ceremony claims they are now adults.

The CofE and others are currently not only not letting people they don't like play with the CofE's toys, they're not allowing people they don't like to play with their own toys. I want everyone to be allowed to play with their own toys and to be able to share them IF THEY WISH TO DO SO.

http://www.penaltychargenotice.co.uk/private-land-enforcement/

""THE LEGAL POSITION

As there is no primary legislation to govern parking on private land the issue of private parking tickets to motorists is dealt with under both contract law and the law of trespass, depending on the circumstances.

Many websites advise motorists to simply not pay private parking tickets as they say they are unenforceable. This was the case in some situations prior to the first of October 2012 as the enforcement company had to find the actual driver at the time. However from October 1st 2012 the Government has addressed this issue by making the registered keeper of the vehicle responsible regardless of who was driving at the time. If the ticket is not paid within 28 days the registered keeper becomes legally liable for the charge unless he provides the actual driver’s details to the parking enforcement company in which case he cannot then be pursued.""",0,1354964112,null,0,false,0,c7d64zf,t3_14hpv5,t1_c7d64zf,t1_c7d60if,null,1430613416,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Sell200AprilAt142,english,"England (Liverpool, City of London, Bournemouth)","Many trains (the inter-town ones called national rail, not the tube) have luggage racks near the end of the carriage. If you put the case in there, try to slot it like a book in a shelf so you don't get blocked in by others, or block other people's. Carriages usually have seats facing both ways and I'd suggest it's better to sit facing where your luggage is even if you're a bit further away. If you have to move someone else's luggage to make yours fit I've never seen someone complain, just do it carefully.

Some trains don't have special luggage areas, in which case it's usually fine to tuck it to the side in the vestibule (the open area just inside from the door). Though sit close because baggage looks more suspicious there. Trains also sometimes have more open carriage areas for buggies / bikes (virgin trains) but also useful for large luggage.

Don't put your luggage by the side of your seat in the walkway. British trains are narrow and it's a pain to get past. If there's a moving buffet car that comes through the train they'll ask you to move it.

If the trains particularly empty you might get away with putting it on the seat next to you, though be prepared to move it somewhere if asked.

The tube's similar but has no baggage racks. If you can stand with it to the side just inside the door, you've got the best chance of not being trapped behind a crowd or getting in people's way. If the tubes quite empty you'll be alright having by your legs on the floor, though sit in the middle of the carriage away from the doors so people don't have to get past you.

Oh, and defo stand to the _right_ on escalators and make sure your bags on the right too so people can walk on the left.

Couple of other things:

- avoid being too loud (phone, music). Turn your music down til you can't hear it with your earphones off.

- most (non tube) trains will have a conductor ticket check even if you went through a ticket barrier at the station (so don't store it away in your bag)",0,1354968581,null,0,1354969654,0,c7d6hkf,t3_14h4ed,t1_c7d6hkf,t3_14h4ed,null,1430613584,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

The point is, belief is by definition a delusion. Because it's a determination to accept something as a fact without logical reasoning or evidence. You can't make the comparisons like you did, because those examples are things that depend on something upcoming that may happen, for starters, and if they DID happen they would be instantly provable. So, even if the examples were examples of belief, which except the first they are not, they are all potentially provable. Religion isn't about whether or not something might happen in the future, it's about something that exists NOW but... Well, you can't see or feel or detect or have any way of proving it. Before you suggest after death, it's still not provable to other individuals. If it's only witnessed by the believer, it's easy to pass anything - however believable, off as a delusion. I often ""see"" things out the corner of my eye, like a pigeon say wondering on the platform at London Bridge, but it isn't there... It's just my peripheral playing tricks.

We can only give general, partisan advice, but other than the helpful specific legal information you've got so far there are always going to be other things you need to know, and to resolve that you need friends and acquaintances nearby. 

If you've had a bit of a sheltered life for so long then you need local, specific knowledge and information about where you live and what you do. So go out of your way to meet all sorts of people in safe situations, and force yourself (if necessary) to interact with them. Church/religion, as suggested, is superb for this, if you are into that sort of thing. Similarly playing or even just watching sport with others is a good way to meet people - make sure it's a team or group activity that involves talking, such as football, cards or ten-pin bowling; not solitary pursuits like running, chess, golf or anything on-line. If you are asked to be on a committee for anything, or there's a chance to help with organising something like a local event or anything, sign up and just offer to help. People love help, and will be keen to get to know you if you are useful. 

I guess you like the internet as it is to Reddit you have turned. So use Twitter if you don't already. It is very safe as you can be (almost) totally anonymous. Seek out people who live locally to you and interact with them. Find out if there are tweetups near you and go to them. This is a very good value way to meet people.

And protection was what the army was brought in for before the IRA drove them from peacekeeping mode to what was effectively warfighting. Don't forget it was the Catholic community who welcomed soldiers into their communities as their protectors when they were deployed initially. Decades of sectarian murdering soon put paid to that.

Undoubtedly episodes such Bloody Sunday were a tragic force against the army's effectiveness here but the hyperbole surrounding what they actually did over the course of the Troubles is astounding.

And then breathlessly the same people painting the picture of protectors as murderers attempt to justify their support for actual murderers who never set out to do anything else? Sorry not interested.

The point about the police force is a better one. Although knowing the likely religion of a guy wearing a uniform still doesn't come close to justifying killing him. And going by the ridiculous level of political analysis on the PSNI today even as they face a terrorist thread with their hands tied, I can totally see how incidents in their case get overblown too. It's not as if a certain party, in the absence of any real direction, doesn't make it their aim to invent issues with the police force.

true,ben9345,english,London,"That's not true. 

In the first treaty we acceded to, namely the treaty of Rome, the Commission, Council and EP were all there, the bureaucracy that supposedly everyone hates was there when we signed up. 

As was he common Agricultural policy, as was 'Free movement of persons, services and capital', as were:
1. articles granting 'aid having a social character, granted to individual consumers...', 
2. aid to 'promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment... (effectively us helping out countries like Greece).

There was also Article 119 which forced member states to 'ensure and subsequently maintain the application of the principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work'. 

At the beginning of the treaty it says (remember this is 1957 so literally the inception of the EC/EU) that member states are:

DETERMINED to lay the foundations of an ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe
...
RESOLVED to ensure the economic and social progress of their countries
...
RESOLVED by thus pooling their resources to preserve and strengthen peace and liberty, and calling upon the other peoples of Europe who share their ideal to join in their efforts.

Now if all that sounds purely economic and not social in anyway then your not reading it right. No doubt there was a focus on the economic side but it was never going to be just economics.

Since when has anyone expected any company to do anything different?  The entire mandate of any publicly traded company - and one that they are obliged to fulfill - is to make a profit for their share holders.

That includes minimising their tax burden, unless the cost of public outcry is higher than the taxes they are avoiding.  This has never been the case, and even now is only the case for Starbucks - and only because they're in a highly competitive, consumer facing business with very little lock-in.

&gt;  They can't have thought that the public would be accepting of this if it became public knowledge?

It has been public knowledge.  If anybody hasn't realised until now that international companies employ elaborate accounting practices to reduce their tax burden, then it's because their head has been in the sand - not because it hasn't been ""public knowledge"".  All that is happening now is that the media is whipping up a frenzy and the government is going a long with it to shift the blame for the sorry state of public finances away from themselves and onto the private sector.

Why would nationalists feel need to take a look at their lives for agreeing the park Be named after a man who is considered a hero and a martyr in the nationalist community?

Its more analogous to the argument : Nobody deserves to have their wallet stolen, but if you leave it in plain view in the middle of a group of known thieves and unprotected, some dickhead is going to steal it. 

&gt; I guess there are elements of this that are hard to appreciate being outside NI, but from an outside perspective it appears that the Alliance attempted to broker a sensible compromise between the unionist and republican positions, and settled on the same policy that they have at Stormont and many DUP controlled councils.

This is exactly what it was, and it was a good idea. But unfortunately it went against a huge proportion of the Alliance electorate (who were clearly ignorant, misinformed or just plain belligerent) and when your political representatives start to ignore you in NI, quite often the pitchforks come out. It's sad but unfortunately NI seems to have larger than its fair share of thugs. When people feel that politics is no longer the answer, these thugs say ""Hey, why not try violence?"" and something primal in all people who feel ignored goes ""Yeah, that might work"".

&gt; It appears that deep divisions, violence and hatred across the political divide in NI have been papered over to a certain extent over the past decades.

It's working, but a lot of people were brought up with huge divides and I don't think the divide will die until they do.

I had that same problem about where to fit in *The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon* but I figured it'd probably be best to watch them twice. Also I'm really hoping there will be more River episodes so I'll probably wait until her timeline is complete before watching. This is the order I worked out, let me know if I have missed anything or got anything in the wrong place:

- A Good Man Goes to War (birth of Melody Pond)
- The Impossible Astronaut / Day of the Moon (Melody -&gt; Mels)
- Let's Kill Hitler (Mels -&gt; River. River enrols at Luna University)
- Closing Time (gets her Doctorate at Luna University, taken by the Silence)
- The Wedding of River Song (River kills/doesn't kill the Doctor - not sure if it's worth watching The Impossible Astronaut here again)
- First Night [spoiler](#s ""River 1 - first night in prison"")
- A Good Man Goes to War (adult River)
- The Impossible Astronaut / Day of the Moon (adult River)
- The Pandorica Opens / Big Bang 
- Time of Angels / Flesh and Stone
- The Wedding of River Song (in Amy's garden at the end)
- The Angels Take Manhattan (River has been released from prison)
- Last Night [spoiler](#s ""Doctor takes River 3 to the Singing Towers"")
- Silence In the Library / Forest of the Dead (River dies)

I know First/Last Night [spoiler] (#s ""needs to go in 3 times but I'm not sure where it fits the third time."") I'm also not totally sure whether these are in the right place:

&gt; - A Good Man Goes to War (adult River)

Also, if they're not meeting in the right order, I'll be really interested in their explanation for how she will look older and older as they go on...

On top of that, memory wipe of a Timelord seems to be imperfect. Donna started to remember when the Master did his business on Earth, so if the Doctor did the same to Oswin then she'd also remember him Asylum of the Daleks.

I have no doubt Clara will be special, but I doubt she'll be the same person as Oswin. Maybe connected in some way, but I really doubt the Doctor Who team is so out of ideas they'd just recycle an old one.

Also, they stated that Coleman wasn't even supposed to play in Asylum of the Daleks, but they ran out of time so just starred her, which, as far as the show is concerned is fine as it's been done plenty of times before.

They can legislate on others, but you know as well as I do that any flags taken down in public areas will quickly be replaced, there is little they can do about them. Same goes for curb painting, murals and bonfires.

People taking an issue over a flag, either way, is just stupid. They could fly it everyday, fuck they could hoist 50 of them up the pole and it would make fuck all difference to my life. At the end of the day it's a thin piece of material.

Transport around Manchester I've no clue about, but I'd guess around £5 a day depending on what you get. (The new cross-city travel pass around Sheffield is £4.30 a day, and that covers buses and trams)

Pubs will depend on if you mean London or not. However, you should be able to get a meal for under £10 each I'd expect. (Maybe more in London). Drinks will depend on what you're drinking and where.

This is what most Brits will picture when they hear an American accent, much like yanks will picture a top hat wearing, monocled, tea drinker.

So to answer your question, the majority asscociate American accents (rightly or wrongly) with your very republican, gun toting, double digit IQ-bearing stereotype. Due to this, here in the UK we tend to have a fairly low opinion of American accents.

**Accommodation:**

[Laterooms.com](http://www.laterooms.com) - Handy for independent hotels

[Travelodge](http://www.travelodge.co.uk) - Cheap, basic, everywhere

[Premier Inn](http://www.premierinn.com) - Bit nicer than Travelodge, although also more expensive.

[Ibis](http://http://ibishotel.ibis.com/gb/united-kingdom/index.shtml) - Wide range of prices, quite a few hotels in London

**Travel:**

[National Rail Enquiries](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk) - For mainline rail tickets (ie London to Manchester). There's loads of other sites that claim to be cheaper, I've never found them to be and they often add a booking fee. Booking ahead as far as possible is the best way to get a discount. Don't buy your tickets on the day you travel unless you want to be ripped off.

[Transport for London](http://tfl.gov.uk) - For the tube etc. You'll almost definitely want a travelcard. As much as they try to flog you one, I wouldn't bother with an oyster for a short visit.

As for food etc, you can spend as much or as little as you want. Fast food is £3-5 per head, chain restaurants about £10-15 per head. If you want really cheap, there's always a corner shop or supermarket not too far away for sandwiches etc. I'd recommend finding a Wetherspoon's pub for cheap cooked breakfasts - you're almost guaranteed to be near one and it'll almost definitely be much cheaper than your hotel.",0,1355004944,null,0,false,0,c7ddfdm,t3_14ijrb,t1_c7ddfdm,t3_14ijrb,null,1430616932,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

He tricked my mother into the event horizon of a collapsing galaxy
to be imprisoned there... forever. He still visits my sister, once a year, every year. I wonder if one day he might forgive her... but there she is. Can you see? He trapped her inside a mirror. Every mirror.

If ever you look at your reflection and see something move behind you just for a second, that's her. That's *always* her. As for me, I was suspended in time and the Doctor put me to work standing over the fields of England as their protector.

Install flash player and then just use a browser to go to the website and watch the stream. Hit full screen as soon as the button appears and you wont even see any ads, if ads are blocking you refresh and try again.

Second alternative is that install ""Opera Mobile Labs"" which is a browser. Not Opera but Opera Mobile Labs. After that add all the adblock extensions to it and it will block all ads on the streaming sites so it will make your job even easier.

Third alternative is use ""Veetle"". Veetle is a free app which lets you watch movies, shows and matches being streamed. You can test the site on your laptop too for example, here are some shows

http://veetle.com/index.php/listing/index/shows

This is the best match streaming app I've found and Veetle has really good servers so they handle the load and do not lag.

Fourth alternative is that you can install Sopcast which is also available for Android. Just go to their site with your droid and download directly.

I disagree. they are perfect examples of people believing in things without evidence, or in some cases believing in things in the face of evidence to the contrary. 

&gt; Because it's a determination to accept something as a fact without logical reasoning or evidence. 

like my examples. Susan believes her boyfriend has changed, when all the evidence says he'll cheat again. a delusion, right? what's the difference? 

&gt; You can't make the comparisons like you did, because those examples are things that depend on something upcoming that may happen, for starters, and if they DID happen they would be instantly provable. 

right...like God would be once you died...or if Jesus came back....

&gt;  Religion isn't about whether or not something might happen in the future, it's about something that exists NOW 

Like Susans NOW boyfriend who she believes is not cheating...

&gt; Before you suggest after death, it's still not provable to other individuals.

which matters why? it's provable to every individual sooner or later...

&gt; The only relevant comparison is to unicorns or fairies, orks, giants, ghouls, ghosts and other made up tosh.

I don't believe you've shown this to be the case. you just don't like my examples, but you can't say exactly why.

true,Learnincurve,derbyshire,Peak District,"/r/photography has a weekly newbie questions thread on a Tuesday, check the links at the top and come join us :) 

But as to answer your question you just take them, if you have a phone with a camera use that to start with. There are many elements of photography, the single most important being composition - read [this](http://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds) first.  

Many many people try to buy their way into taking good photos but without learning this basic principle first and as a result are taking shit photos with £10,000 worth of gear.  My advice is getting down to eye level is incredibly important, be it a animal, child or statue the basic saying is ""never take a picture of a duck from above"". 

Another thing is that mega pixels don't mean shit when you get above 8mp. It's sensor size that makes a difference. A mobile phone has a teeny tiny sensor, so in basic terms less information can be recorded, where as a full frame camera has a sensor the same size as 35mm film. This is why a 8mp DSLR will always always out perform a 24mp phone  when it comes to larger photographs. But in all honestly although you may not get the blurry background with a phone, there isn't much difference between any camera if you are printing standard photograph print size if you have good light. 

I'm a camera dealer and the inside tip is that canon will take in old cameras and give you a discount on the new one *but* they don't throw these cameras away, they refurbish them and stick them on the bay (with a year warranty) undercutting everyone else which has driven the prices down to the point that they can be £100-£300 less than the nikon equivalent. The Canon 20D in particular is *obscenely* good value for money (it's not got the indoor performance as the current models but it will be damn near identical outside).

Don't buy a bridge camera if you are wanting to learn, they are for your granny who wants a long zoom but will never take it out of auto.

The vast majority of the Northern Irish population, both Republican and Loyalist. For what its worth, my reading of the peace process was the Republicans were often more willing to compromise than the other side, but at this stage that isn't a particularly useful observation.

What *is* true is there are minorities that remain committed to escalating social conflict and maintaining paramilitary politics/violence on both sides of the sectarian divide (including the hideous [Republican Action Against Drugs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Action_Against_Drugs).

My, not very informed, analysis is that the heady mix of identity politics and the thrill of street fighting draws in a) old hands who can't give it up and much more importantly b) kids from poor backgrounds who are bored/casting around for a positive identity to defend etc.

The periodic rioting in Belfast has bugger all to do with the flag, and has a lot to do with very similar social pressures to what we have in the rest of the UK, and led to our own riots in 2011, being channelled through different social relations. Put differently, if the sectarian divide was not there the kids would be kicking off anyway just on a different pretext.

I think it's likely that people are attributing ""Irrationality"" and/or ""cognitive dissonance"" to be ""mental illness"", in these cases.

I think that in general I see religious people as having certain 'issues' (who doesn't?) but whether that is due to an emotional problem, ignorance (in the truest sense rather than an insult) of certain topics (cosmology for example, or perhaps biology (I'm thinking 'origins')), childhood indoctrination or simply that they haven't taken the time to think about 'the world' in a cold, rational way, would have to be established on an individual level. And I imagine most of it could fall under ""cognitive dissonance"" as I mentioned before.

At least give him a proper chance before we sell him off for nothing and could go on to be a very good player elsewhere. The potential is there in him, people talk about Henderson and say he's got potential even after the very poor performances he had last season, Pacheco is slightly younger than him and has been given nowhere near the amount of chances, sure Hendo cost 16 million(?) and had premier league experience but my point still stands. (Not knocking Henderson by the way, he has improved this season)

He's made 17 appearances and with 14 of them being over two years ago, and mostly substitute appearances, it's not really fair to judge him on them as he's matured since. He did well at his time at Norwich, his time at Rayo Vallecano was hampered by injuries and I don't recall him ever being in the Spanish Third Division.

&gt;I have no doubt Clara will be special, but I doubt she'll be the same person as Oswin. Maybe connected in some way, but I really doubt the Doctor Who team is so out of ideas they'd just recycle an old one.

This. Please.
The rest. Meh. 

There are no coincidences in DW. None, ever. And especially not with Moffat at the helm. 

I think she's a character ""out of time,"" stuck in different times, in different places that she never remembers. The Doctor may be her savior, but sadly, only in a way similar to Donna; she will either die or have no recollection of their travels. 

I think it's important to remember also, that there is no way this was an accident. The introduction of JLC was kept a secret for a reason, and those who say this is merely a ""trial run,"" or a ""final audition,"" I think, are way off. 

Just like the Doctor, people lie. And although I don't doubt JLC's claim that she plays someone new, I also don't believe she isn't cleverly omitting the truth to keep the season's secrets. Or any of them for that matter—I haven't seen anyone say that she wasn't supposed to be a part of the opener, but who takes any DW interviews as the whole truth? 


TL;DR: I think JLC plays someone outstandingly complicated, and unlike anyone we've explored with before, and that her first onscreen performance has everything to do with who she is.",0,1355023288,null,0,false,0,c7dhv2b,t3_14ih6y,t1_c7dhv2b,t1_c7dcbx7,null,1430619089,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

* The episode where you find out who the guy in the black costume is.  The reveal scene where he comes out of the shower is perhaps the best use of music to evoke emotion I have seen.  I have watched the clip on youtube showing the musicians recording it probably 30 or 40 times.  It somehow seems to encapsulate both her emotion and curiosity and the views burning desire to finally know. The crescendos and accelerandos sync perfectly with the video editing, drawing the viewer in emotionally as the camera continues to show us a new peice of the environment, each more astonishing then the last, finally reaching a zenith as she sees him for the first time for who he actually is.  As a viewer the music combined with the visuals almost lets you feel the palpable sense of amazement and wonder at seeing that person in that place as the owner of that suit.

If flags are of no consequence why is the EU so insistant that national flags be removed? Why should nations have a foreign flag everywhere.

I believe the festival of lighst was a campaign funded by the EU that produced childrens cartoons that discouraged children from saying Christmas. It featured an African an Arab and other foreign kids in Ireland in class. The Irish kid says merry Christmas and the foreign kids get upset saying it is not christmas for them, the Irish kids is upset that he upset them.

Teacher enters and they have a very special moment where the teacher says 'why don't call it a festival of lights!' and everyone can be included.
Yay says the Indian kid, Diwali has lights.
Yay says the Jewish Palestinian Lesbian, something about a candle

Then a feel god song about multiculturalism.

Then the Irish Kid says what about Hindu, Jewish, Any other religions festival, will they be changed to include me?

Then the teacher says, check your privilege shitlord! The child is sent away to be reeducated.

The historical revisionism... EU history textbooks refer to USE as if it is a country. When it says, the parliament, it means EU parliament, when it says our president, it means the EU.

I think your side really has lost the future of the EU debate.

It has been abundantly clear to anyone half a wit in their head that the goal of the EU is one nation with total control. It seeks to erode sovereignty bypassing any democratic attempt to stop it.

Understandably there are more stringent measures in place for celebrity patients, and the measures at this hospital should be looked at to see how this mistake occurred.

However there's also an issue of why as a society we consider it ok for pranks like this to be carried out. Why somehow we behave like if someone is trying to do something ""as a joke"" that excuses them from considering the potential consequences of their actions. Why do we not expect people in entertainment (e.g. radio shows) to consider what might happen if they attempt a call like this and their story is effective and they're given information. It doesn't take too long to think that maybe someone will be reprimanded or lose their job, or be hounded or demonised by the media, or could be treated badly by their coworkers. I'm not suggesting they could have thought something this terrible would happen, but there are serious consequences that could have been foreseen, and it bothers me that we accept that it's ok they didn't think of this because ""it was just a prank"".

You and I are all going to try to find ways of minimising our personal tax burden. As a DPhil student, I don't have to pay income tax or NI on my stipend earnings, even if they exceed the personal allowance (provided I work full time and don't take side jobs which exceed the allowance). I don't care how many people whine about me avoiding tax, the government decided that this is fine so I'm going to bloody do it!

The people to blame for ""tax avoidance"" are no other than the ones who set the rules leaving loopholes allowing for it. That's our lovely HMRC and government. You want to fix the situation? Then direct your anger at the tax men (and ladies) and government.

The government is very happy for the public to be angry at the corporations because they can win popularity points for paying lip service without actually doing anything.

**TL,DR: companies want to keep as much of their money as possible, just like you and me. It's the government's responsibility to ensure that we are each taxed a ""fair"" amount.

In the opinion of some people - other people have a different opinion.

Ultimately, I think it odd that we blame politicians for following political dogma, considering that is why we elected them in the first place. Ed Balls is also following his political dogma when he proposes higher debt funded spending.

What actually irks me is that neither side ever details the costs of higher debt funded spending.

If £20 billion of debt funding spending can (or cant) generate enough GDP growth to raises enough taxes to repay the debt within a sensible timeframe, such as 10-15 years, then why on earth don't the politicians say so?

It is frustratingly difficult to work out whether higher debt or lower debt would be good for the economy because no one who  has the ability to work it out actually crunches the numbers.

Until we have some organisation crunching and publishing those numbers, we are stuck with politicial dogma.

**However** it also has some standout moments. *The Empty Child* and *The Doctor Dances* being a particular personal highlight. And it does introduce the new viewer to many ""familiar"" Doctor Who villains quite nicely.

You don't have to watch the old series at all if you don't want to. If you do, I would recommend just picking up a few classic episodes, at least to begin with.

Then tax would be x% of that.  All the details needed are already in the land registry database, so it's a fairly trivial task.

A separate idea, but often bound to LVT is that of citizen's income.  You take all the LVT, take off the government costs, then divide the remainder amongst every citizen equally.

I say this because it means that series 1 and 5 are natural starting points. I usually suggest series 5, then going back if you like it, but since you liked Tennant, I'd suggest start with series 1.

[DW Sports](http://www.dwfitnessclubs.com/locations/cambridge) - Beehive Centre, although I have heard some bad things about their equipment failures etc.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"What your describing is how my surgery worked prior to this change. Now you **can't** book ahead. If I phone tomorrow morning, and get through to a receptionist? The appointments that I can book are for tomorrow only - I can't ask for an appointment on Tuesday / Wednesday. If I want an appointment on Tuesday / Wednesday I have to phone on Tuesday / Wednesday, and hope I can get through, and get an appointment.

Same with cancellations - you phone through-out the day, and try and get one. For that day.

You're also no longer able to just turn up and ask to see a GP at their earliest convenience - you'll be directed to a walk-in clinic. The nearest one being two bus journeys from where the surgery is located [I'm fortunate in that there's another one about 300M from where I work.]

The only services that you can book ahead, are for blood tests, and things like the Asthma clinic, which have to be booked ahead, as it's run by a visiting GP.

So to summarise. If it's an emergency you either take yourself to A&amp;E, or go to a walk-in clinic and wait for however long - on a Saturday afternoon, it's typically four hours. If it's a routine appointment you have to phone at 8AM in the morning, and book an appointment for that day. If you can get through. I tried five days in a row, without success.

If you can get through, you need to try and book the last appointment slot they've got, so you can get to it, coming back from work.

They do offer an evening session - Tuesday. So if you work normal hours, realistically you can now only see a GP one day of the week. So you phone at 8AM - when most people are supposed to be commuting to work, hope you can actually get through, and then try to book the latter slots.

The NHS is indeed a wonderful thing. When it's not run by bureaucrats who impose the kind of stupidity that now dictates how you get an appointment at my GP surgery.",0,1355053956,null,0,false,0,c7dn9s4,t3_14groy,t1_c7dn9s4,t1_c7dddfy,null,1430621716,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Not impossible, I'd guess, but highly unlikely. 
That said, if you CAN mimic accents that well, that's pretty awesome and I wish I had your ability. 

The only reason I sound so negative is because if someone suspects you're poking fun by imitating the local accent, it's not going to do you any favours.

**EDIT:** At time of edit, this comment has been upvoted by three people and downvoted by six. Nobody has posted a reply that discusses the question I have posed.
I am not saying that the woman's death was selfish, nor am I saying that it wasn't a tragedy. However, I am at a loss in understanding how anyone can directly blame the DJs for it. Must we all be worried about causing a death every time we prank someone, or make a joke, or argue? If she had not committed suicide, all anybody would be talking about here is how reckless and irresponsible she was at her job. Her reaction to the events does not change them, nor does it change what the DJs did.
These DJs had no idea who this woman was. You absolutely cannot say that we should go through life worrying about if people are depressed and suicidal as we meet them. With that in mind, what would you say about the DJs if she had just lost her job and got on with her life?
I personally think to blame these men, who are already feeling like massive shits and are quite possibly blaming themselves, is atrocious. I just hope that none of you find yourselves in the position where your actions, with no semblance of intent, cause a death.
