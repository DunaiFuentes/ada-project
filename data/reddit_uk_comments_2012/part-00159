true,Galcius,null,null,"So there are a lot of (very funny) humorous responses, but I'll try and offer a relatively serious one.

Pastimes are generally related to class, there are few things that all classes engage in. If we roughly divide Britain into 3 classes - the working class, the middle class and the upper class, activities are generally as follows:

**Working Class:**

 * Football (i.e. Soccer)

 * Darts

 * Television (Soap Operas, reality TV, talk shows)

 * Betting (There are a *lot* of betting places in the UK, usually located on high streets. I think betting on horses and football results are the most common, but I'm rather middle class so it's not an activity I've taken part in.)


**Middle Class:**

 * Hockey

 * Football

 * Cricket 

 * Rugby

 * Golf

 * Television (usually slightly more high-brow reality shows such as The Apprentice, satire, comedy, and documentaries. Middle class people rarely watch talk shows and might half follow soap operas but wouldn't take them seriously.)


**Upper Class:**

 * Shooting

 * Hunting

 * Cricket

 * Golf

 * Polo

 * Horse Racing (particularly betting on the races in person at the race course, unlike the lower classes who will usually go to a broker on the high street)

 * Television (not sure, probably similar viewing habits to the Middle Class)


**Shared**

 * The Pub. The pub is sort of the binding element of British society. All classes will go to the pub to socialise and relax as well as eat meals (most pubs serve food these days, often everything from Breakfast to Roast Dinner). Pubs are usually aimed at particular classes, for example a Middle or Upper class person wouldn't go into a ""Working Mens Club"" if they could possibly avoid it, similarly you won't usually find an inner city working class person in a country pub. However you do get a good mix of people in most city pubs. 


 * Clubbing. Clubbing is different than going to the pub. At the pub you might sit down, have a meal and a pint, talk with friends and then leave, but if you're going clubbing, you're going to dance and drink. Again, clubbing is not really segregated by class, but it is segregated by age - not many people over the age of 30 go clubbing, and in my experience most people in their mid 20s have already made the transition to going to the pub to socialise instead of clubbing. Basically, I'd go to a pub with my parents, but not a club (in fact I wouldn't go to a club with anyone as I don't like them! :P )


 * Watching Football. Following a team and watching football is another reasonably common past time, mostly for men. I don't personally find it very interesting, but it is another one that tends to cross class boundaries a bit. 


Remember that I'm writing this from a class perspective, and my own background is Middle Class. So my view is subjective and slanted. There are probably other common pastimes that other classes get up to that I just don't know about, and things that my family just didn't care for that are common to the Middle Class. 

I hope that's helpful.

true,Lit-Up,cnty-uk,Republican,"Tourism revenue is not only irrelevant to a debate about our constitution, the suggestion that the monarchy promotes tourism is also untrue. There is not a single shred of evidence to back this up. Of the top 20 tourist attractions in the UK only one royal residence makes it: Windsor Castle at number 17 (beaten comfortably by Windsor Legoland, in at number 7). Royal residences account for less than 1% of total tourist revenue. Indeed, the success of the Tower of London (number 6 in the list) suggests that tourism would benefit if Buckingham Palace and Windsor castle were vacated by the Windsor family.
The British tourist industry is successful and robust - castles and palaces would remain a part of our heritage regardless of whether or not we have a monarchy (look at Versaille). Other attractions, such as the London Eye, Trafalgar Square, the west end, Bath, Stonehenge, Britain's beautiful countryside and so on, will continue to attract tourists in the same numbers as they do today. The government body responsible for tourism, Visit Britain, hasn't even collated statistics on the monarchy as an attraction, which shows it is not a key factor in the promotion of the UK as a tourist destination.

The tourism argument has been dreamt up to distract people from the real issues. There is no evidence that the monarchy is good for tourism, in fact, there are good reasons why the opposite might be true.

In my mind what it comes down to is in the long-term by snatching market share away and not paying taxes on the profits, you will contribute less to the taxman which means less money to be re-invested in the infrastructure which supports your business and customers.

Say if a member of the EDL wrote something that a publisher refused to print, they might declare (wrongly) that their freedom of speech or expression is being affected. It would be true if the government stepped in and said that it was illegal for it to be printed, but a lot of people seem to confuse the difference. I think it's a bit dangerous for freedom of speech if we don't understand what it really means. 

This case is very different though. If the EDL put up a billboard and people illegally painted over it, that wouldn't be a free speech issue, it's just vandalism. They *do* have a right to not have their property vandalised though. You could argue that if law enforcement refused to do anything about it *because* of the message or if, in this case, the government endorsed the hacker's actions, that that would be a violation of free speech, but petty vandalism isn't.

I'm not going to get into a detailed explanation of postcolonial sentiment. But I would like to point a few things out.

r/India, for whatever reason, is permeated with right wing nationalists. A large proportion of the cherry picked comments being criticised here - rightly or otherwise - are put forward by said majority. It's almost like using the opinion of the EDL to claim that the Brits are all racists. 

That said, ""Water under the bridge"" is a sentiment that more easily comes to you than to us. The Brits aren't responsible for all the evils in India today; we're a 65 year old country, we've had more than our fair share of fuck ups since we kicked you out. In fact there's no saying if there would be an India without you lot. However; let's not be so naive as to pretend that overall, the British Raj, wasn't the single most comprehensive, humiliating, evil clusterfuck in the history of the region. 

So you see, while we understand your pain in dealing with your postcolonial guilt - yes, yes, it's been a while hasn't it - you will excuse us if we maintain, unreservedly, that we got the short end of that stick.

But British didn't treat India as a proper province, they could have allowed some development to take place in the industrial sector. But no, they had a minimal development policy. They developed only as much necessary to keep the country creaking. 

Most of the developments like railways were designed for faster removal of resources than for the benefit of the people. What the people got was a mere trickle down effect. (see Mike Davis's '[Late Victorian Holocausts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Victorian_Holocausts)', yeah plural, those were more than one holocaust).

Education was limited to princes and serfs. The British trained only a few paper-pushers, just enough necessary, to keep the bureaucracy going. Even Gandhi's father was a bureaucrat. 

The Company was more worried about its stock prices than 10 million dying of hunger. It was more concerned about revenue than aid. It took a 1 million loan from Bank of England to, wait-for-it, support its army. Florence Nightingale had to start a campaign to tell British commoners that actually a famine was on.

British killed [millions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_major_famines_in_India_during_British_rule) by their apathetic attitudes in famines and epidemics. Multiple famines with each killing tens of millions. Don't even get me  started on the dirty [salt taxes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Disobedience_Movement), plunder of [temple treasures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohinoor), [Rowlatt Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowlatt_Act) and [Doctrine of Lapse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctrine_of_Lapse). 

British hindered industrial development and killed artisan trades by stopping export of Indian clothes, on the pressure of English mill owners. They took Indian cotton, spun it in England and Netherlands and flooded the Indian market with English and Dutch cloth. Since, Indians didn't have a representation, they could only whine. And the British turned a deaf ear.

For example, when people tried to oppose Salt taxes, the Viceroy, Lord Irwin famously said:

*At present the prospect of a salt campaign does not keep me awake at night.*

Yeah, if as taxing salt was his birthright. He put 80,000 in jail for trying to evaporate sea water. Really freaking hilarious ain't it?

The Palestinians were under the impression that the land was guaranteed to them by the British after WW1 and the Jews had a similar idea. England was in charge of the area until the late 40's and during their occupation there was a massive influx of Jews. When England was no longer responsible for what is now Israel, the UN drew up an agreement splitting the land in half to form two separate countries for the Palestinians and the Jews that would share holy sites in the area. The Jews accepted the plan, the Palestinians did not, the English left, the UN lost control and a civil war erupted.

Now as we all know the Palestinians lost the civil war, even though they were aided by almost every surrounding country and then some, and the disputed area became what is now Israel. Now since the creation of the state of Israel they have been involved in numerous wars, usually against multiple neighboring nations at a time, and have returned the majority of land occupied during war. Yes Israel still occupies the Golan Heights and the West bank, but you can see why they would be hesitant to discontinue their occupation since terrorists took control of the Gaza Strip after they left.

back then we may have created about 4/5 chances for him a game (excluding the ones he made himself), now we create roughly 8/9 chances a game for Suarez (excluding the hundred millions he creates for himself and Im sure he'd gladly create for Torres/any other striker)

After travelling around Europe with a group of friends for two weeks, we return home absolutely exhausted. I, and a few others, had minimal sleep the night before came home due to finding a bar that served 1 litre beers. Granted, this much was our own fault.

We'd booked a month before a coach to pick us up from Gatwick and take us to Nottingham. We rush through the airport, quickly say our goodbyes to those who lived in the South and were being collected by parents etc, and run off the catch our coach.

We had worried for no reason as were an hour early for the bus. It was about 10pm at this point so we got some food at a cafe and waited by the bus stop for our bus. It was fifteen minutes past the time our bus was due, and it hadn't arrived. This is pretty normal for UK buses though, so we weren't too worried. 

Then suddenly, our coach arrives. We were absolutely thrilled. Until it sped straight past us without stopping. We're all thinking what the hell is going on. After twenty minutes more we collaborate with other passengers and call us National Express to ask what's going on. 

After a two hour 'investigation', the driver claims he stopped and we said he didn't. There's nothing we can do, they say the best they can do is offer a replacement bus. And this was only after much complaining. At 5am, we get a bus to London whereupon we sit in Victoria Train station for five hours (taking refuge in McDonalds) before getting another train at 9am.

We never received compensation of any sort.

The pentagon, fine. The world trade centre was hit purely to kill civilians, trying to defend the actions of cunts who think that’s acceptable is just disgusting frankly.

&gt;So the Hiroshima deaths were just caught in the cross fire?

Yep, they were given warnings and stayed, not much else the Americans could have done for them.

&gt;""They"" are not your ""friends"", you do realise US companies are some of the worst tax dodgers in the world? But I digress—your argument was about ""defending us"" (not ""US"")  

The American people are our friends whether you like it or not. You may disagree with their government, but if the American people are deliberately targeted, we have a moral duty to stand by their side.

&gt;Talking of friends, we had some in Bengal (1943) and we contributed directly and passively to the deaths of up to 4 million people through starvation. 

During the height of ww2... we had slightly more to worry about then some villagers on the other side of the world, obviously resources were going to be used to fight off the Nazi’s, how’s that surprising?

&gt;Now that description fits exactly with what Hiroshima was about, and they did it twice remember? It was to kill as many civilians as possible

The point was to take down strategic military installations. They still would of been hit had every civilian in the area been evacuated.

&gt;It is accepted scholarly thought that the real reason was to put the fear of god into the Soviets

And thank fuck they did.

&gt;It is moronic to believe that the whole Iraqi and Afghan population was conspiring to attack America, or as you see it ""us"", and therefore they posed a legitimate threat and deserved all the droney goodness, tortures and birth defects thereafter.

I love how you make out as if we just rolled in, tortured every single person we came across, destroyed all their houses while raping the women and walked off. We’ve pumped billions into the country. We’ve built them roads, hospitals, school, given them a stable government, stopped the rule of the barbaric Taliban (for now). I never agreed with Iraq, I still believe Afghanistan was legitimate however.

&gt;course was cover for some other eco-political interest of which we have to speculate—perhaps fighting the enemies of Israel

Maybe it was to defend Israel, after 60 years of being attacked and threatened by the surrounding countries I can’t really blame the Israelis for making strong ties with the US, I’d do the same.

true,sigbhu,null,null,"since I've been quoted here from the original thread, let me expand on what I said.

British colonisation of India was a complex affair: there were some good bits, and some bad.

The first time I met my roommate, it was a restaurant and we got into an argument about british colonialism, esp in India. he was british, and if this wasn't already clear, i am indian. 

however, there is a twist: he argued that it was almost entirely a bad thing, while I argued that there were many good things about it that people don't talk about. 

**the good bits:**

I'm entirely a product of empire. English is the only language I speak, and think in. it would be unimaginable that I would be the person I am, thinking what I think now, without a couple of centuries of british rule in India. 

my grandfather went to a british-run school (before independence, obv.) and once told me a story of how it was. this was a little school in the middle of nowhere, and every month, the government would send a very red, very unhappy scottish man called mckertish to the school to inspect it. he would make the kids sing ""god save the queen"" (which my grandfather would render as ""god shave the queen"", earning him a reputation as a revolutionary firebrand) and ask each kid about their lives in english to see how far along they were getting. 

*this level of involvement and attention to detail is unheard of in INDIAN public schools today* 

this school was free for my grandfather, he learnt english, he went to college (also british run) and helped rebuild India after independence. 

let me make no bones about it: cultural relativism is bullshit. indian ""culture"" before british had stagnated for quite a bit, and it's fair to say that a culture of humanism, liberalism and freedom is superior to a culture steeped in feudalism and mysticism.

for a thousand years, we (as indians) had a long period of relative prosperity and peace. however, we failed to capitalise on that and doing anything with it. we continued to remain largely illiterate, feudal and agriculturally dependent. for whatever reason, geographic, cultural, or political, the enlightenment, and then the industrial revolution, happened in europe, and especially in england, and not in India. 

either deliberately, as part of the white man's burden, or accidentally, by contagion, european enlightenment ideas were introduced to India and transformed it more radically than anything *we* came up with for a thousand years. 

if the british didn't colonise us, I don't think we'd be the liberal democracy we are today (at least on paper). 

**the bad bits:**

now, there are some things the british did that are objectively evil in India. the massacre at jallianwallahbagh is a good example. (though all the shooting was actually done by ethnically indian soldiers).

I don't think it's too much to ask for the british government to apologise for this. this was a bad thing, and an apology doesn't cost you anything.  it's the right thing to do. 

but what I'm most concerned about is economic violence during colonialism. 

now, I've mentioned earlier that it's a matter of cultural shame and misfortune that the enlightenment and the industrial revolution happened in europe and not India. however, once started, the industrial revolution was sustained by raw military force. the mills in lancashire were fed by forced labour in India. thumbs were cut off thousands of indian weavers to prevent competition for england's dark satanic mills. indians were transported en masse to the west indies as indentured workers to produce raw material for england's factories. 

there is no doubt that economic interactions between coloniser and colony were heavy-handed, unfair, and largely rapacious. the reason the british economy exploded was because of the largest redistribution of resources the world has ever seen: from *hundreds of millions* in china and India to a *few* in britain. 

that India is a secular, democratic republic is almost entirely because of the enlightened rule of the british raj. that India is poor, deindustrialised and backward is also almost entirely because of the rapacious plundering of the british raj.

The site is still an embarrassing joke but I'm not nearly as angry about it. I really should have checked this obvious thing first before flying off the handle, sorry.

**I don't want public discourse to be guided by who ever has the power to stop the other side from speaking** 

At it's heart this has been done for the same reasons that the EDL use thuggery and intermediation. They use their power over the EDL, in this case their ability to hack the EDL site, to express their control over them. Just like the EDL use their power, the abhorrent willingness to use physical violence, to express their control over groups they don't like. 

Freedom of speech is about protection from your government but this is still simply a blatant act of censorship by one group over another by means of force to deny expression they disagree with.

That is not ok, it's not good and it's not even funny. It's embarrassing.

Speech is best countered by speech and when the EDLs speech is so inherently idiotic you are only helping them by attempting to censor them. There is no need for give them the impression what they are saying is valid enough to be suppressed when you should easily be able to run rings around their ideas and arguments with hardly a second thought. 

When the EDL speak they only embarrass them self's, by stopping them doing so you are *helping* them and giving them a actual true chance to play the victim.

This does nothing but undermine the good work of those who are actively working against the EDL in sustainable reasonable and useful ways.

But if you feel it should be tied it to something specific, the answer is right there in front of you: the story of Amy Pond.  I mean, she dies possibly sometime before she is born, grows up with her own daughter as her best friend, and even explicitly states at the end of Ep. 5:

*There's a little girl waiting in a garden. She's going to wait a long while, so she's going to need a lot of hope. Go to her. Tell her a story. Tell her that if she's patient, the days are coming that she'll never forget. Tell her she'll go to see and fight pirates. She'll fall in love with a man who'll wait two thousand years to keep her safe. Tell her she'll give hope to the greatest painter who ever lived. And save a whale in outer space.

true,anarchistica,null,null,"&gt; during their occupation there was a massive influx of Jews.

The influx started in 1881, though.

&gt; When England was no longer responsible for what is now Israel, the UN drew up an agreement splitting the land in half to form two separate countries for the Palestinians and the Jews that would share holy sites in the area. The Jews accepted the plan, the Palestinians did not

The UN, like the League of Nations, was still a tool controlled by the British and French empires. They used the LoN to annex conquered territory after WW2, and dominated the 40-ish member UN too.

As for the Partition Plan, even the UN itself admitted it was bad. There were 660.000 Jews in Palestine in 1947, and twice as many Palestinians. Of those Jews, some 600.000 were recent immigrants who often immigrated illegally too. In 1947 this 33% of the population owns 6% of the land. The UN decides to give them another full half of the land, which includes the economically most viable part and 1/3rd of the Palestinian population. In one of the reports on the matter the UN predicts the Palestinian state would not be economically viable.

If all of Russia would move to the US, and the UN decides to give them everything west of the Mississippi, do you think anyone would agree to that?

&gt; Now as we all know the Palestinians lost the civil war, even though they were aided by almost every surrounding country and then some

It did help that the Jews included WW2 veterans and had superior equipment, training, motivation, etc. It's not like they started in 1948, the Jewish terrorist organisations that formed the basis for the IDF had been around for decades.

&gt; have returned the majority of land occupied during war. Yes Israel still occupies the Golan Heights and the West bank

The Palestinians currently control about a quarter of the land the UN plan acceded to them. Israel controls 88% of the land.

&gt; but you can see why they would be hesitant to discontinue their occupation since terrorists took control of the Gaza Strip after they left.

AFAIK, Israel is the only country in the world that has awarded terrorists with [military service ribbons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Military_decorations#Service_ribbons). &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

Yeah, it escalated into the cold war that has nearly lead to mutual destruction several times. We have at least a few brave Soviets to thank for it not happening (see Cuban Missile Crisis).

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;apparently Lebanon doesn't even let Jews into the country, that's fucked up!

Can you give any authoritative source for this?  These sorts of rumours fly about all the time, and usually it's rumour rather than reality, or there are all sorts of nuances which get lost in a game of Chinese whispers. 

Stories have always circulated amongst travellers about not being able to travel to Greece with a Turkish stamp, and vice versa; and not being able to travel to Lebanon with an Israeli stamp and vice versa.  Personally, I've never had any of these problems (and you can always replace your passport if you do).  There used to be stories of ""removable visas"" too, though I've never been offered one.  

Stories of nationalities being barred are slightly different obviously, and all of the above, and these, are going to be somewhat dependant on existing conflict zones, wars, regional politics etc.  Remember, the border between Israel and Lebanon is a conflict hotspot, with problems in either direction - missiles from the South of Lebanon have struck Israeli territory, and Israel has conducted military operations in Lebanon, [most recently in 2006](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Lebanon_War).

However, I've never ever heard that Lebanon investigates people's ethnic heritage or religious convictions before issuing visas.  I'm not a Jew, and I don't wish to underplay any travel issues they might experience there, but my own experience of Lebanon was a mixed up, fairly liberal Middle Eastern country full of very friendly and accommodating people.  Yes, it's a bit of a powder keg, and the security situation varies a lot.  Yes there are some nasty people hiding out there.  But, the average Lebanese is tolerant, enlightened, and as educated as their personal situation allows.

Edit:  Incidentally, it's not just an issue in ""backwards"" Middle Eastern countries.  The ""free"" US used to put hurdles in front of citizens wishing to travel to some parts of the world, e.g. Vietnam and Cuba.  I think, even now, US citizens generally have to travel via Mexico to visit Cuba, though that old bullshit might have ended.  It's certainly ended vis a vis Vietnam, since Clinton normalised relations.

Edit edit:  This is a US site, so treat it with some scepticism, but [this is what they say on Israeli stamps](http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_948.html#entry_requirements).

It's not like we were talking about the finer points of sheep shearing and got onto concentration camps and how the poor animals represent an unnoticed genocide.

true,jbubermensch,US,usa,"You're spot on in most points here. Particularly that we don't have the type of transitionary passer in our band of two that is capable of really controlling the flow of the game. I see us buying to fill that capability, as Oscar has too much talent in the final third to be pulled back. Possibly in January we could go for someone like Fernandinho, who's a deep passer with great range and a lot of experience in the incredibly fluid brand of soccer that we're playing now.

As far as Torres goes, I absolutely agree. I've said it elsewhere and I'll say it again: Torres will never have the quality that he once did. We keep seeing these glimpses and thinking he'll come back to his old form, but he's a different player now. He just doesn't have the striker's mentality anymore, and without it he's not dangerous. He's too easily frustrated and doesn't have a real eye for goal.  We need to either start using Sturridge more or play Hazard in a false nine. I think either option would bring more goals than the current system. Obviously we should also buy up front in January as well.

As far as Mikel goes, his strength isn't necessarily in bullying people off the ball. He's just great at positioning, and wins the ball through interceptions or forcing foolish passes that someone else intercepts.  I agree that his ability in the final third is sub-par, but that's not his job. He's there to shield the defense, and he does it very well. If the system had the proper personnel, Mikel would be forcing possession changes and then laying the ball off to a playmaker, whose job it would be to find passes that transition into attack. If we had someone like that in the system, Mikel would be perfect in his position. We only notice his lack of playmaking because that's not Ramires' greatest skill either.

Finally, I completely disagree about Malouda. He had one good season for us for which I'm definitely grateful, but towards the end of last year it was made very clear to him that he was going to be surplus to requirements. He's being paid far more than his ability deserves, and that's money that the club could be using to fill its gaps. By overpricing himself this summer, he burdened the club with his salary, and I think he deserves some sort of punishment for it.

Unfortunately I think we're still in transition this year, and I wouldn't expect loads of trophies. But if we shore up a couple holes we have the potential for an incredibly entertaining and dangerous team.

This is harder to explain, but basically we weren't planning on being serious for a number of good reasons, but we fell for each other really hard.

And obviously, ended up going to a Halloween party with her while I was dressed up as Rory. She did NOT go as Amy because we thought that would kinda be weird, plus she had a costume already planned.

I can absolutely confirm that there is no question of privatising the police.

As the Home Secretary has made crystal clear, the crime fighters will remain police officers, patrolling will not be privatised and policing will remain a public service, accountable to the people and carried out by consent.

The law prevents the jobs police officers do from being delivered by private contractors beyond the limited powers of transport and custody conferred by the last Labour government.

When it comes to the work that goes on behind the scenes – things like administration, IT and maintenance – if savings can be made by collaborating with other police forces, other emergency services, local authorities or private companies I will look at them.

It is vital that as much of our policing budget as possible is directed to frontline policing, and not wasted on expensive and inefficient administration.

Many Thanks.

No one is bigger than the club. Fernando made it clear with his body language and his actions that he thought differently. The day he handed in his transfer request is the day he lost all my adoration, and more importantly, my respect.

Can't believe the lot of you want him back. Remember how you praised Kenny's comments about ""no one being bigger than the club,"" and how Agger let Torres know what he thought of the move? You all have short memories I suppose.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"&gt;Would it not be simpler to say that if you do business in the UK as part of a multinational, then the part that's in the UK needs to have a set of UK accounts and get taxed accordingly?

I think this is roughly how it works out currently; the companies have national subsidiaries, or local companies owned by the same group of people, and they simply move cash from one to the other by setting up transactions. So say company A in the UK buys a bike pump off company B in Luxemborg for £100million, that's perfectly legal. Company A only gets taxed on what money it has left after all the transactions are done.

Global warming and climate change have both been used since the 80s.

So Climate change, which is just as accurate, is preferable.

&gt;'Fuck the Zionists' killed it for me. I'm no fan of Israel but other nations in the middle east are just as greater evil. From watching Homeland I did some research and apparently Lebanon doesn't even let Jews into the country, that's fucked up!

Pointing at other people's wrongdoing in an attempt to give Israel a pass is a typical Hasbara tactic. 

By the by, I can find no information to suggest that Jews are prohibited from visiting Lebanon. Israelis or people who have been to Israel might be unable to enter like with some other Arab countries but this isn't based on the religion of the person but the passport or the stamps in them and even then it's not set in stone in the countries I am aware of that do this. 

Considering the brutal violence inflicted on Lebanon by Israel since the first invasion, it's hardly surprising if there are feelings of enmity towards Israelis and Jews (I believe the majority of Jews support the existence of a racist Jewish homeland and deny the Nakba and Palestinians' right to return). 

It is typical for Israel apologists to make misleading claims about the way Jews are treated. Everything is a blood libel. Your expressing what appears to be a falsehood (that you learned from a shitty US drama? God help you) as somehow related to the EDL hackers request for us to ""Fuck Zionists"". Connecting irrelevant things as if they draw a picture of Jew-hating is typical Hasbara. 

Whether or not Lebanon denies access to Jews has no bearing on whether or not we should ""Fuck Zionists"". It has nothing to say to us about the purity of motivation on the part of the hackers. 

So you come across as an Israel sympathiser because you sounded like a Hasbara dude.

After the January window, if we get a decent couple of players in, I expect the next set of fixtures to have a lot more green in it. Lets hope for a really powerful second half of the season to get us up to a European qualifying place.

Governments want these large companies to operate in their country so don't crack down on them like a ton of bricks, but at the same time, have a duty to ensure the MNC is paying their way and that its people aren't being exploited.

MNCs by nature will always tend to something that will increase their bottom line. Governments should pull in the other direction. The problem is the government doesn't have a huge interest in fighting a big battle, and so the things MNCs can legally get away with are much broader than should be.

The baby was not a ""goo clone""; it was a real baby from a real person. The Amy who'd been traveling with the Doctor all that time was in fact the ganger (which is why the Doctor reverted it with his sonic, disrupting the connection). Part of the reason River couldn't be there was because she didn't want to be, and partly because I imagine it was a fixed point (""time can be rewritten""... I'm not convinced- remember the Waters of Mars). Could you explain what exactly it was in The Girl Who Waited that confused you?

The TARDIS has no cloaking device. It has a perception filter. Some people notice it and some people don't.

true,jihangir,null,null,"German cars tend to be notoriously expensive over here. Audis, VWs, BMWs, are not considered 'cheap cars'.

For £500, you're not going to get much, I'm afraid. Unless it's absolutely essential that you have a car for work, I'd suggest waiting until you have a bit more saved up before taking the plunge. A £500 car is going to be un-reliable, and probably cost you more than a £1,000 a year in maintenance getting it through the MOT.

That's my suggestion, however I'll answer your question. Your best bet for £500 is to look at a Ford Ka. These are very popular, and hence getting spares (from both scrap yards and garages) is cheap. Insurance is cheap, and they tend to be quite reliable. Earlier models tend to suffer from rust, so going for a post-2002 model is better.

Have you considered getting a moped or cheap motorbike? They're infinitely cheaper and probably less hassle than a £500 car!

Hope that helps, and welcome to the UK!

full data of the local authority grants are [here](http://www.local.communities.gov.uk/finance/1112/grant.htm#set1213)

I did a quick comparison in the cuts in the top and bottom two local authorities in the Guardian data at the end of [this page](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/nov/14/council-cuts-england-detailed)

Based on this:

Hackney 2012: £224m, 2013: £207m, cut 7.4%

Liverpool 2012: £338m, 2013: £313m, cut 7.4%

East Dorset 2012: £2.57m, 2013: £2.32m, cut 9.8%

North Dorset £3.649m, 2013: £3.24m, cut 11.2%

Spending per person  

Hackney (based on a population of 217101, the data on the first link is complicated, but this is close to an estimate on Hackney council website of 219200, though their estimate is for 2010, should be close enough)

2012: £1032/person, 2013: £956/person

North Dorset (based on a population of 66117 (see above excuses))

2012: £55/person, 2013: £49/person



The Guardian really need to explain their 'Cut £ per head' column, if Hackney had really had a cut per head of £266, their grant would have been cut by £57m, around 25%.

The Master said (in series 3 even I  believe) that the Doctor closed a rift at the Medusa Cascade singlehandedly. His name burns there, apparently. The Doctor somehow created a timelock across a gigantic portion of space and time. Where did he get so much power? The rift, perhaps? 

And from the Series 4 finale, we know that Timelocks can be unlocked. How exactly is always left in unspoken, but...it seems likely the Doctor's name would unlock the Timelock, but only if he himself speaks it. 

Then, in the God complex he sees what he fears most. ""Oh...of course it's you"". Now it forks a bit. This can be himself, which has often been proposed. It would fall in line with this theory, fearing his own power and such. 

Or it could be Timelord society. (which would tie in with the cloister bell). You, after all, can be both singular and plural.

What a stupid straw man, our belief is that every human has basic rights. That those rights are not universally offered and that we do not have the power to force every government to recognise those rights does not change or undermine those beliefs. If anything it just shows the importance of actually practising what we preach.  


&gt; Means that we do NOT have the power nor influence in the UK to be able to make sure everybody in the world has human rights.

But where we do have the power we offer those rights or those rights are mealiness and leave us with no moral authority to condemn them in other nations. Just look at what is happening to the USA where they condemn censorship in other nations but are actively perusing legislation in SOPA and pushing for trade agreements like TPP or ACTA that include censorship tools and threaten freedom of expression. The west is regularly called out by the Muslim world as being hypercritical and you want to take some of our basic core beliefs, that every human has human rights, and only apply those rights to select groups mainly our own citizens? Do you honestly not see the danger in that?       

&gt;The situation with this guy is very different though. He's just another Abu Hanza, a man preaching hate to young muslims in an effort to have acts of terrorism performed here. He wants you to die, he wants me to die, he wants our PM and queen to die, he hates our culture, way of life and would be happy for another 7/7 to occur.

And to remove him from our country you are willing to undermine fundamental beliefs that make up our way of life? Do you not understand how stupid that is? 

&gt;This guy is dangerous, costing us money to keep here, and quite frankly I'd like the idea that he was deported to be tortured somewhere, he deserves it.

So you'd rather ship him off somewhere that we may struggle to keep an eye on him and in doing so giving him exactly what him and his ilk want? Genius!

Let me explain something to you, terrorism is a tool to force people and place to change their behaviour. It's not about winning a war, it's not about taking control it's about creating fear. Some times that's used to make demands but when they are targeting our way of life it does not matter if you give in to the terrorists demands so long as you give in to that fear. 

You see a lot of what extremists don't like about us are the rights and privileges we think every person should have. Freedom of religion and equal treatment no matter your race, gender or creed is something that does not sit well with them. They attack us not with the intent that we will turn to their way of life but that we don't offer a chance at a better one. Our freedoms, our belief in basic human rights threatens their ability to control and subjugate because we offer an attractive alternative.

By making us give up liberty for security they destroy what they see as a threat to their way of life. You are being conned by people like Qatada into doing exactly what they want. The only harm Qatada can really do to us now is if he is able to make up undermine our ideals when dealing with him. 

You say he wants to destroy our way of life? His not going to do that with a few bombs, his going to do it by making people like you so scared you'll happily dismantle it for him. You are being used and you can't even see it.

Which makes this next bit even more entertaining. 

&gt;If Russia tried to invade us and we had to fight them off after using our crumbling rust bucket that is trident, would you pick up a gun to kill these soldiers, or hope that we'd surrender and be under Russian rule instead?

War and terrorism are not the same thing. If I saw some one about to set off a bomb in a terrorist act  I would stop them, if that meant killing them at the time I would. I would not how ever give up everything I believe in in the hopes that it might maybe stop future terrorist acts from taking place. 

As for war I'll just point you to the [Geneva Convention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions) which are a case of us making international agreements to respect human rights even in the times of war. Do you not realise how pathetic that makes you sound here? That you bring up being at war as an attempt to justify not applying human right to people who are not our citizens when we actively seek to apply human rights to the citizens of nations we are at war with and expect them to do the same? 

&gt;This guy is worse than any invading soldier. His mindframe is set against our way of life, he wants other men talking the same hatred and for countless younger men to commit acts of terrorism.

And you not only want to help him do it but offer him a hugely powerful recruitment tool for angry young men. How we are dealing Qatada is one of most potent and important tools in preventing and undoing the radicalization people like Qatada are trying to foster. His smug self satisfied act in the face of this is nothing more than an attempt to goad us in to doing what he wants. He is trying to make it look like the only way that we actually win here is what he wants and it's very sadly working. 

&gt;Fuck him, him not being in our country would be beneficial to us. He isnt s british citizen and should have no right whatsoever to be here.

You are right, it's not and the truth is there are a bunch of reasons he shouldn't be here but that does not change the fact that he is. He is here and we have to deal with that. Which we can either do by holding on the ideals that Qatada hates or by throwing them away and giving him just what he wants. I know which I'd pick.

&gt;You cant be politically fundamental when guys like this are concerned, if the government was it could cost British lives.

This is the price of liberty and as a nation we've committed our self's to that liberty. If you don't like that I'd suggest you go find your self a police state dictatorship to live in for a while, I'm pretty sure you'll quickly realise just how lucky we are and how important it is that we uphold our ideals.

What's funny is that you use the call to war but then talk about the horrific idea that British lives maybe lost if we don't act in the way you suggest. Which is it? Is our way of life worth dying for or should no one ever have to die to protect it? We fight people like Qatada every day by going on with our lives and keeping our ideals in the face of harm they threaten us with. That makes me deeply proud.

In short, you are a cowered, I understand why you are scared I understand why you are calling for the things that you are calling for but you are actively seeking to help people like Qarada achieve their goals and you are doing so because you are scared of them. That's it.

I'd suggest you spend some time thinking about that.  

**edit**

To be clear if you want to give up liberty for security because of are scared of the bad man that's up to you. You even have the right to vote in a way to seek those changes how ever please don't pretend this has anything to do with protecting our way of life or anything to do with you disliking Qatada. 

I personally think it's silly thing to do, that what you are giving up is not worth the cost and the truth is that you can't even be sure by giving it up that you are any safer or that the terrorist will stop trying to hurt you but that a debate we can have. What we can't have a debate about is the that is anything other than a choice between standing up for our way of life in the face threats to it or giving it up to in an attempt to better protect our self's.

Given it's demographic, Reddit is a terrible place to get an opinion on legalisation of weed that is an accurate reflection of the UK. We have  a collaboration of like minded people, looking at resources that back up each other's opinions, and a voting system of popularity that creates the suppression of alternative arguments and opinions, no mater how well argued or equally valid. If there's two things on Reddit that are 90% circlejerk and 10% discussion it's religion and drugs.

&gt;Think you may join us one day and legalize it?

Not in the near future. It went from middle tier drug to bottom tier drug to decriminalised (sort of) and back to middle tier, political shenanigans against the governments own commissioned scientists who argue for legalisation, and nothing in the political wind that suggests absolutely any appetite for heading back to lowering the nature of the offence / decriminalisation / legalisation.",0,1352906700,null,0,1352907235,0,c718u3g,t3_136l0b,t1_c718u3g,t3_136l0b,null,1430403802,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"I think our inability to deploy the ball to our wide men last weekend was due to our injuries (squad depth?) and Dempsey. Huddlestone was never going to be the man to distribute cleanly all game against the likes of city (and neither could Carroll if asked). We needed Dembele.

Dempsey was poor and was unable to draw pressure from any one else around him, this allowed city to allocated resources to blocking our pace on the wings. A good run or two, maybe a key pass would have opened up space up front for us to probe. Instead we never managed to take the pressure off of Bale/Lennon.

AVB foresaw this, you could clearly see that our strategy was built on earning and making the most of set pieces (which city have been conceding to recently). It was successful, but unfortunately we couldn't hold on.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"There are whole different layers here when we talk about development. The whole concept and extent of development as we now think of it is to some degree an artifact of the Industrial Revolution. There were means of increasing agricultural yields, sanitation, ease of transport or various things before industrialization, but they were inherently slow processes, and the onus is there to demonstrate that such these processes were ongoing in pre colonial India. In that sense, stagnation is neutral, if it was the state of affairs before Britain arrived. 

And for development beyond this slow, pre industrial process, at the most fundamental level, if you remove all influence from Britain and the rest of Europe, you remove the technology which makes the modern world possible. You accuse me of colonial condescension, but the alternative is to say that the Mughal Empire, or the other Indian States, were engaged in a parallel Renaissance, Scientific Revolution, and Industrial Revolution, which would have led to the same ends at the same pace. You'll have to enlighten me if I'm incorrect, but my instinct is to place this in the same category as the Muslims who say quite sincerely that Western science is useless because all science is in the Koran. 

It's also worth bearing mind that the Industrial Revolution only had an impact on Britain from 1830 onwards, and in the rest of Europe from 1850 or 1870 onwards. Working conditions for most people actually declined in Britain for about a century, and working people were only treated decently from about 1920 onwards. So the delay is there, but it is not as significant as you're making out, nor is it all in the direction you talk about.

Moreover, if you go for the more realistic alternative circumstance from isolation, that India developed a more equal trading relationship, it's not necessarily the case that India would have zoomed ahead. Why would it not have behaved like the Ottoman Empire, for instance? If it developed, why would it not have broken down into the sort of inter-state or inter-nation conflict seen in Europe, or the rapacious Imperialism which European countries certainly inflicted, or which emerged from the Westernized Japan.

I say this not to defend the Empire in general, but to rebuff one, in my opinion, incorrect form of criticism. The great evil of British India was that India was not allowed to decide its own fate, but that doesn't mean it is meaningful to assume the most utopian, alternative, hypothetical outcome, and hold Britain responsible for the difference, what the poster in the previous thread called 1.8 billion deaths and 'the greatest crime in the history of humanity'. That if only the British hadn't been involved, India would already, inevitably be dominating the world (as it may well do in future). That is a sort of nationalism, of the same sort that justified the British Empire, just applied to the other side.

Why exactly *do* people listen to their shit music very loudly through shit in-built speakers on their phones instead of using headphones, particularly on buses? 

Even if it was awesome, brilliant, amazing music that everybody on the bus was in to, it would sound crap through that speaker on their phone.

Can they not afford headphones? Do they think if they don't have their headphones they somehow have a ""right"" to listen to this music irrespective of other people's comfort? Do they think they're making the environment better for other people, by adding some ""class tunes"", perhaps? Are they ""showing off"", somehow? Or is *meant* to be antagonistic? 

I experienced this once on a Megabus coach from London Victoria to Manchester - a 5 hour journey, and it was annoying by the time we'd got to Oxford Street...

My girlfriend lost it a bit and told the teens involved that it just wasn't fair to do this all the way to Manchester, and they reacted in a ""What's your problem?"" tone, called her some names, I made it very clear that this was *not* cool and they needed to can it, and then they sat in silence throughout the rest of the journey *seething* at us as if we were the ones being unreasonable. Weirdly, two other passengers behind us also thought it was me/my girlfriend being unreasonable. Not one other passenger offered support when it was getting argumentative.

Karma was restored when it transpired nearer Manchester that their phone batteries were dying (I wonder what could have caused that?!), and they had no way of getting to their final destination because they couldn't call anybody to pick them up. Fucking idiots.

Maybe it's some sort of socially evolved thing i don't know.

You could have pointed out literally anything else, but instead you focused on the fact that doing minimum wage work for barely any time a week pays very little.

Other things you could have pointed out include that it is unfair to have minimum wage based on age (it assumes certain circumstances, which may not be the same for everyone, and normally you aren't allowed to discriminate wages on such things anyway), or that paying  minimum wage essentially allows some companies (supermarket chains for example) to subsidise their profits with government money, or the fact that despite the austerity measures being placed on the poorest in our society people like George Osbourne still say things like 'it isn't fair for all the burden to be placed on the rich' (I can't remember exactly what he said, but it was along those lines, and what I said wasn't editorialised - he was pretty blunt about what he said).",0,1352911916,null,0,false,0,c71a643,t3_136plw,t1_c71a643,t3_136plw,null,1430404421,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

On Blu-Ray. I've also purchased S1 - 4 of Doctor Who, The Shadow Line, Two seasons of Luther, and all of Spooks, on DVD.

My problem with the BBC are the thugs they employ to collect the licence fee. Having been accused of taking part in a conspiracy, and being told that I would be arrested for owning a TV without a licence? And having received letters from them that I would perceive to be of a threatening nature? There's no way in hell I'm paying a penny towards them.

Now in fairness I no longer receive those letters. And I did get the flimsiest of apologies for the way I was spoken to. But it took a seven page letter, send via recorded deliver, and CC'd to my local MP, for them to do anything about it.

Then there's the obvious? If I'm not watching any live TV, why should I pay a licence?",0,1352914378,null,0,false,0,c71aub7,t3_136o9u,t1_c71aub7,t1_c71alac,null,1430404811,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt;Ricardo is on the other end of the scale (or so I've heard, I believe he teamed up with Malthus? I have his book but haven't read it yet. Read the first part of Malthus and it was pretty disgusting), regarding the poor as parasites who have to be made to work harder or starved out.

Yes, Ricardo himself was a pretty unpleasant figure (certainly from a leftie's perspective, but [the Ricardian socialists](http://cas.umkc.edu/econ/economics/faculty/Lee/courses/488/reading/esu2.pdf) used a lot of his work - as well as Smith's to develop what became known (by Marx and others) as ""utopian socialism"".  Thomas Hodgskin is a particular favourite of mine, and one of the first people to coin the term capitalist.  [He wasn't very polite I'm afraid...](http://www.cleverley.org/areopagus/docs/hodg/hodgmain.html)

Sorry to hear of your own experience of crime, but on this:

&gt;There will be property crime as long as there are people with no morals. Even if everyone has equal property some bastard will decide he wants more than other people and won't be afraid to take it from them. I very much doubt that many crimes are committed from actual need, but rather jealousy, want and a lack of sympathy for others.

I would have to argue the libertarian socialist case, that there will always be property crime so long as there is (private) property.  If it is, as you argue, more about jealousy than greed, then this is even more evident.  Just so we're clear - I'm against private property, not usufructory possession and use.

&gt; (You on justice - I'd prefer to call if law since it isn't just!): Unfortunately it's mostly used by the rich as a manner to keep the rest of us in line.

Yes.  Proudhon has a good quote on this - ""Laws: We know what they are, and what they are worth! They are spider webs for the rich and mighty, steel chains for the poor and weak, fishing nets in the hands of government.""

&gt; (On racism, you): think that it can just be based on tradition - i.e. if you're brought up being told black people are inferior and you never come into contact with one, you'll probably believe it and maintain the belief and pass it on to your descendants. 

Definitely, but of course, any remotely libertarian upbringing would act against this (parenting, education, etc.)  I definitely think the current economic system, and the hierarchies it supports, engenders and exploits go a long way towards explaining the racism, sexism, heterosexism, gender-identity prejudices, ableism etc.

&gt;(On Inside Job:) It looks a little like it might be trying to take a complex situation and blame it on a few individuals (which is always an easy way out), but that's just a very slight worry. I'll order it in as I'm very interested in all this. 

Do, it's very detailed and full of useful data, whether you agree with some of the agendas within it or not.  Some of the interviews with those involved are very telling, but it's actually a fairly in-depth look at some very complex issues rather than merely banker bashing (though there's some of the latter).

Yes to behavioural and new economics btw.  Interesting fields both.

&gt;Remember that Capitalism doesn't preclude worker owned businesses (see for example, John Lewis, the Co-op, etc.)

I'd argue that it does.  A worker-owned business is by definition socialist.  Indeed, self-employment as a sole trader is pseudo socialist (Marx actually called it the ancient system of production, but it's non-exploitative).  On the other hand, I don't buy that John Lewis or the Co-op are strictly worker-owned businesses.  I can go into detail if you wish.  A better (though imperfect) model is Mondragon corpration.  There's a very dated 1980 BBC Horizon programme about it [here](http://american.coop/content/mondragon-experiment-1980-bbc-documentary), but there are several more up-to-date news stories and videos about it in less detail online.

true,Girlwithnousername,uk,"United Kingdom, London","I had quite a positive experience with TV licensing. I'd been living in a flat for 2.5 years when I discovered that I didn't need a TV licence for watching TV on my computer (I was always under the impression that you needed one if you had kit that HAD the ability to watch TV). When I moved into the flat the TV arial was so appalling that it was unwatchable. My landlord was unable to come up with a solution, I tried a TV booster and then just gave up. So my six-month old TV sat there gathering dust for a year until I finally gave it to his son to give it to his elderly auntie because it was useless to me.

So I only ever watch TV on my mac, and as my internet has generally never been good enough to stream stuff live, I've never bothered. 

Anyway, I think some new reg came in and the landlord was forced to name all tenants so we suddenly turned up on a list of some sort, hence the very long delay between moving in and getting a TV licence demand letter. 

It took six months of writing (not many letters, just slow correspondence), and not only did I get them to leave me alone, but I got 2.5 years of TV licence payments back without really having to kick up very much of a fuss at all. I explained about the aerial, I explained about giving the TV away, I told them that I never stream live, and then finally I got my (now former) landlord to sign a statement saying that, 'to the best of my knowledge, all of the above is true.' 

As many have pointed out above, they need to prove that you've been watching live television. How they go about doing that without witnessing it is beyond me.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's through pensions and other financial contrivances that the economy, politics, and society in general is corrupted. It's the modern equivalent of the afterlife—work hard in the present and your reward will be in the next. A pension scheme is such that the current productive generation subsidises the ""retired"" previous. Ignoring health care, old age should be quite inexpensive unless you feel entitled to two or three holidays a year, that sort of thing. The trouble is that we (collectively) construct lives that are very expensive, poor inefficient housing difficult to heat and repair, urban areas that demand the car to allow travel which by design disenfranchises the youth and the elderly, but most of all industry produces people of both weak mind and body.

The last issue is at first offensive but it is a genuine complex issue. We favour specialists that become useless over time, jobs that weaken people through RSI, sedentary lifestyles, artificial social interaction through the television, and an economy which is generally exclusive. Families and communities that would have provided the support for a ""retirement"" of sorts are broken through non-obvious modern migration patterns as the youth moves for university, then jobs, then for the best schools. I don't think we can support mass retirements in the way we have done for 30 years, and if it isn't already it will be a rich man's privilege. Retirement ages have already increased, many people will never afford to pay into one, retirement projections are being cut, and a majority have had a quantitively eased wage cut. Nothing I have seen tells me that I should trust any of these financial constructs, and I should pursue regenerative sources of tangible wealth rather than hope for sterling in the future.

The 2012 NHS GP registered list size was 280k and the Mayhew 2011 study put it at a conservative 237k. The population makeup of Hackney results in a vastly lower census response rate than many other areas due to language barriers and the natural tendency of the residents to avoid contact with 'official' documents like the census.

Mayhew 2011 - http://www.hackney.gov.uk/Assets/Documents/estimating-and-profiling-the-population-of-hackney.pdf

2012 NHS ADS registered - http://www.commissioningboard.nhs.uk/files/2012/11/rca-calc-stages.xls

Even the projected 2013 ONS census figures from the second link indicate 251k for Hackney from the 219k in 2010. In comparison North Dorset has a projection for 2013 of 69k from 66k in 2010. 

The worrying part for me is the incoming public health funding allocations for 2013/14, for which the funding formula is being revised in light of recent NHS funding changes and the shift of responsibilities to local authorities. There's not much information around yet, but the rumour is that the change will see the formula changed to be based on age of population instead of deprivation.

So, we went to sit down and wait for him to acquire change as everyone else got on the bus and paid, and then he turned around and shouted ""so are you going to pay or what?"" and I said ""are you going to stop being so rude?""

Some random old man on the bus was like ""do you want me to call the police?!"" to the driver, most remained silent and another woman huffed and puffed at us.

I was like whattheFUCK? I felt like there was some piece of the puzzle missing, something we'd missed that made us look like the arseholes, but actually I think it's just people actually would rather tolerate bullshit than the stress of combating the problem.

Andy Carroll. 35 million pounds. Granted, we probably aren't as butthurt as Chelsea for their gigantic investment in Torres, but whatever.

He didn't fit the club. Sure, he's a lad with promise and youth, but we have to face the music at some point. Carroll was an investment that we shouldn't have made. Not for that ridiculous sum of money. Plus, Suarez for 2/3 his cost was a much better deal. I'd have thought FSG would at least have had some influence, what with their sabermetric approach to the Red Sox, but that clearly went to hell.

Would I like to see Carroll back in LFC kit? Surely. The 35 mil that we invested in him is sunk cost at this point; we might as well get the best use out of him if we can't ""flip"" him to another team for at least 25 mil. He's not a bad player by any means, he needed a chance (which we honestly didn't really give him), and a much smaller chip on his shoulder.

Low cost, low impact living is often the method. The issue is that the costs of getting to that point are higher than you may imagine.

That is pretty much the same as equity investment. However if you mean growing a business, there is an argument that is not the tangible wealth you describe.

I imagine regions would be the main factor that would account for salary differences, as I also read around reddit some time back, can't remember when, that the average salary in the UK is around 25k Pounds. Which means the numbers above do make sense, but I also looked up on some rent in major cities, 1-2 bedroom apartment would go around 500-600 Pounds. A 30k early income (30% income tax?) ends up to 1750 Pounds a month/2170 Euros. It's a decent salary, don't get me wrong, I wouldn't mind it - but compared to other places it does look lower, doesn't it?

They might buy goods and services from other companies in the group at an inflated price (someone has already mentioned brand rights/royalties) but this isn't actually as easy at it sounds.

HMRC aren't stupid, they know that this is a potential way to avoid tax and so there are a mountain of regulations about this but to put it simply you have to price these transactions at a similar rate as if you had made them with an unrelated third party (""arm's length""). If this is judged not to be the case then these transactions are essentially revalued to a deemed market value when calculating tax. 

Example: Your company buys payroll services from your other company at a huge price so you make low profits. HMRC don't like this, it's deemed that actually you (should have) paid quite a low price for this considering what these services cost on the open market - your costs are now deemed to be lower, your profit is deemed to be higher and your tax charge is now higher. Now you have a small amount of money in hand (small profits) but a high tax charge, bad news. This bit of tax law is huge, really complicated and a nightmare even when you're doing it completely by the book and with an honest heart.

""A fair amount of tax"" is a lot more complicated than the gut reaction suggests. Google's a a pretty good example of this. They generate £XX in this country but most of the actual work is done in California (where their 17,000 employee are). Do you tax that money here? There? Both? Split? Twice? Why?

I'm not defending this kind of behaviour but while it's very hard to define ""fair"" it's a lot easier to define ""legal"".

That is not the only point you are making at all. That point is barely relevant to most of this discussion. Most people relationship with debt is about their relationship with their mortgage. If you intend to avoid one btw your retirement living costs will be higher and variable.

Your initial point was that equity investment is a pointless rip off. Fixed income investing is beneath you and even a simple savings account is ruled out. I was genuinely curious as to how intend to fund your later years (presumably when the RSI curtails your code monkey ways). However it seems the plan is wishful thinking.

The truth is if you want to shake off the system then mud is your only real choice. Otherwise you have to make the system work for you and that means engaging with that most artificial of things, money.

Avoid debt and take every little advantage you can along the way (tax relief on the way in and 25% tax free on the way out is not much, but I'd suggest it will work better than burying gold bars).

Either on the wings or centrally, he can create a couple inches for a shot or cross with the ball at his feet, and his technique, as is known, is superb. Great delivery off of crosses and set pieces, good passing, good ball control. The other thing is that his awareness in the box has developed a lot. He's really good at picking out the right pass to directly create chances, and that's a helpful thing whether he's played wide or in the center.

The examples you gave are all players of a different style than Eriksen; even Wilshere is not as attacking-minded as Eriksen, despite the fact that he likes to take people on. Eriksen is very direct with his passing pretty often, which is a good thing in his advanced role, but only when players are getting forward (this is why I think he struggled to adapt in such a strong group at the Euros).

Filtering out Israeli crimes, since probably 1922. Currently there is a coordinated script to legitimise the current invasion and attack on civilians. [Anti-war](http://antiwar.com/blog/2012/11/11/israels-latest-assault-on-gaza-the-lie-of-who-started-it/) explains the lie. However, that  BBC article is a very strict narrative that is being copied by all major publications, and mirrors the ITN narrative just aired:

1. Stress how these strikes have taken out a senior military official therefore are immediately legitimate.
* Stress this is a response to ""rocket fire"", again legitimacy.
* Stress how the Palestinian people are calling for vengeance.
* Talk up islamic extremism.
* Don't mention the known child deaths, understate the Palestinian death toll.
* Don't mention apartheid.
* Only give or (give the lion's share of) quotage and face-time to Israeli spokespeople.
* Throw in political cliche: ""We continue to call on all sides to exercise restraint to prevent a dangerous escalation that would be in no-one's interests.""

Let's look at the [Dailymail comments](http://co.uk/news/article-2232937/Israeli-airstrike-kills-Hamas-military-chief-Gaza-sparking-fears-new-war.html):

&gt; * Well done Israel. Thank you. If only every government in the West had a similar policy for dealing with terrorists, instead of going to any and every extent to protect their human rights. And then pay out massive sums of money when this filth complain that they weren't treated right!

&gt; * Best video Ive seen in a long time. One less terrorist on the planet. Good.

&gt; * Once again Israel shows how to deal with those who would destroy them. No need to spend millions in various courts trying to remove fanatics who present a clear and present danger for them. Identify the enemy, locate the enemy, destroy the enemy. Israel places the rights and lives of it's citizens way above the multitude of enemies who seek their destruction.

After reading these comments, I am enlightened somewhat. It probably isn't a good idea at all for British police to be carrying guns about due to certain situations escalating to the point where an offender may get a hold of the gun and shoot a shitload of innocent bystanders down.

However, I still think there should be a rule in place (alongside the proper training) for police to carry guns in certain situations (like the lovely Tottenham riots we witnessed last year). Shit, water cannons would've been great to at least start with. There is still a mindset of ""fuck it, the officer can't harm me"" causing people to continue with their mindless out-of-control actions on our nation.

In his last 26 appearances for LFC he scored 9 goals (.34 goals per match) and in his current vein of form for Chelsea, by far his best at the club, he has 7 goals in 18 appearances this season for CFC, he is scoring .38 goals per match.  And that was his worst year for LFC by a huge margin.  He left us after scoring 81 in 142, .57 goals per match.  That's staggering.  Suarez is a top, top player, but he doesn't have the numbers to match Torres' at his departure point.

My guess is, if the City interest is real, they would use LS7 as a CF behind one or two strikers.  They already have proven goalscorers, so this is less important to them.  But, clearly City should pay what we want--no reason to compromise.

It's my belief that this is the lineup of episodes that will maximize your enjoyment of the series and keep you understanding the season long continuities, without any filler whatsoever. This was especially difficult with Season 6, though, since I saw the entire season and I still don't really understand what the hell went on. Keep that in mind when you watch those episodes. If you're looking for purely the highlights of the series and nothing else, I've put a *!!!* after the episodes which I believe most people will agree are the absolute cream of the crop, best the series has to offer overall.

true,BrokenClockwerk,lfc50,,"It's true that City have struggled a bit this season, but they are still guaranteed at least 3rd place and it's really their Champions' League performances that are awful, not their league ones.

Most teams are lucky to have one amazing striker (like Suarez or RVP or Ibrahimovich, etc). Manchester City has two in Tevez and Aguero, as well as an extremely good backup (Dzeko) and a very promising youngster. If Suarez goes to City, he's not going to want to rot on a bench, which means sitting Aguero or Tevez and basically guaranteeing that Dzeko and Balotelli only play in cups and during an injury crisis.

Yes, Balotelli might be sold, and although Dzeko is extremely good, he's still replaceable. However, are strikers the reason that City are not winning as much? I don't think so. They are struggling to adapt to Mancini's 3-5-2. They've only let in 10 goals so far this season (compare to 11 for Chelsea and 16 for United), which gives them a good defensive record, but the wingbacks are struggling to be effective, and the midfield isn't looking especially creative. With Joe Hart in diminished form, it's no surprise the City are looking weaker than they did last season.

Maybe Mancini hopes that he can just flood the field with good strikers and hope to win every game 3-2 like United does, but that's not a good strategy for the long term. If City is looking to invest, they need to look towards the midfield 5.

You are a pragmatist who is willing to compromise core ideals if you think the outcome is wroth it. I simply never think compromise those ideas is ever worth it.

&gt;We aren't going to torture him to gain a statement of confession for braking our laws against terrorism. As a country, we don't torture people. Extraditing him would NOT make us brake any human rights laws in this country.

The law states then sending some one to a place where they maybe tutored as you may as well just torture them your self. Again we return to the idea that human rights are a universal concept. You either think every one has them or you don't at which point they stop being human rights and become national ones. 

&gt; Do you think the people of this country honestly GIVE A FUCK about somebody who wants us all to die

Yes.

&gt;He wants to be deported does he? I can almost guarantee you he does NOT want to be deported.

I guess I could have phrased that better. He likely does not want to be deported but he is perfectly aware that it's going to happen one way or another and he would much prefer it happens either illegally or by forcing us to undermine our ideals.

&gt;Infact, off the top of my head I can think of better examples he could use.

I'm going to set up something that maybe a strawman here but I think it's relevant.  You logic here is that because people are murdered we shouldn't worry about the morality of theft.

There are other things he can use but for him and the people who follow him us stripping away his rights is a potent one.

&gt;OK, you realise that things such as the Geneva Conventions are only effective if they're enforced?

Yes, my point was simply that you where pointing to war as a reason to abandon human rights when we as a nation are signed to them.

I abhor the way we've been ignoring them. For example I find the use of ""enemy combatant"" as a way to ignore the conventions as deeply shameful. It's in fact an act of the kind of ""pragmatic"" compromise that you seem to be such a fan of.  Because you are asking that we pull the same trick Qatada.

&gt; In essence, I want to live in North Korea 

No, in essence you are willing to give up liberty for security and I was just suggesting a way in which you could experience where that path can lead with out attempting to screw over the country in which I live. 

As for the rest of your comment, it's just you explaining why you are scared and why you are willing to give up grand ideas for the selfish advancement of you and your tribe. If we are ever going to move past that it has to start now. I simply don't think we can ever see peace unless we stick to thinking as humanity as a single whole group and that every human born has rights that we should strive to do our best to see them have. 

&gt;How am I actively trying to help Qatada achieve his goals? 

I would very much like to see the man out of the country but I would like to see  it done legally with out us compromising the kind of rights that threaten Qarada. I went over all this already but you simply ignore responding to that in favour of shit like this, which is very clearly *not* what I was arguing.
