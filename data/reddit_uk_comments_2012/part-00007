Voting No simply means that you want the ownership of the team to include the CPO in the discussion.

What Roman and Buck were trying to do in October was buy their way out of including the supporters in on the decision. They attempted to purchase enough CPO shares so that they could influence the vote to sell the Freehold of Stamford Bridge to Chelsea FC. Had they been successful, the CPO's only bargaining chip (The Freehold) would be in Chelsea FC's possession, and then Chelsea FC could have moved the club anywhere they wanted without having to consult the supporters. (THAT is the issue. The outrage from the CPO had little to do with moving to a new stadium. It had everything to do with Chelsea FC's administrators attempting to circumvent the whole reason the CPO was set up in the first place.)

&gt; homosexuals to be given the death sentence.

looks like the title was- (so it might be referring to that)
&gt; Death Penalty?

I think that this sort of rhetoric used to preach to a community could lead to physical actions against individuals. So in some ways an incitement of violence etc. It is not a pre-crime judging them for actions which might not be committed but an incitement of them.

Secondly individuals recieving these leaflets seemed to effect peoples lives too 
&gt;  ""Sometimes I wondered whether I would be getting a burning rag through the letterbox or if I would be attacked in the street.""

I am also one of those who throws this around quite a bit, it often comes up on forums due to clashes between UK/Europeans and Americans and I am always a little torn.

I think in our society there is a need for controlling the way people can be damaged by this kind of hate but it can't just be someone being offended it has to have an effect.

I think it is so complex because free speech or freedom in general presumes that beings can think freely. Although our realities are always being changed by outside influences be that behavioral, social etc. I think that American's take the freedom too far to almost validate archaic thought patterns as being free whilst they in fact are anything but. While on the other hand punishing someone for expressing their thoughts in such a way isn't entirely through there free expression. Either one is hard to quantify and that is why I suggest in someways the effects or consequences may be more viable to consider. 

However in the end punishing someone for expressing beliefs isn't all that effective in changing those perceptions and is more likely to cause cultural groups to feel persecuted because the sentence hasn't changed their perception which they will still probably be unable to rationalise this hatred as being wrong. I think it is a problem that can only be solved through education or other ways of changing people's perceptions. However again this is a hard argument because how can you suggest right/wrong thought patterns/beliefs.

I'd attribute a lot of 'hate speech' to cultural constructs that people have been washed with over there lives. Culture to me is a symptom of human social evolution along with just being a construct, people in different parts of the world formed cultures to cope with their environments both physical and social. Parts of those cultures really are incompatible with a post modern society like Britain. In fact any part of culture that impacts on how power is distributed or how you treat another really is. (Like legislation)  To be honest I think that the only parts of culture relevant to the future of humanity is the sense of identity and festival (Like self expression).

Another annoying thing was mystery woman, she was mystery for mystery's sake and when you think about it, her being there doesn't make any sense.
      
Biggest problem with the episode besides regeneration scene is Time Lords, writing make big deal out of them and they have in total 7 (or so) minutes proper screentime and they get defeated really easily, just for sake of having more time to do overly long buildup scene for regeneration.
    
Also, quick question, how the hell did Doctor survive that fall from spaceship? End of time had potential to be great story, but it did one major mistake and it was focusing too much on regeneration rather than the actual events causing it.

He's extremely versatile: he can play on either wing to great effect, as a lone striker, partnered striker or on the shoulder of someone up front.

Work rate: he works harder than any other player on the team. Against certain teams this doesn't work, because they clamp him down (again, he is versatile - so he can drift) but quite often it pays off. He also sacrifices his body to win balls back.

Aerial threat: The way Carroll has been playing, he's probably the best header on the ball from open play. His reactions are also AMAZING. Remember how he ducked under Enrique's low cross that Carroll locked on to against Everton?

Penalties: Kuyt has the best penalty record of any player in LFC history. Of his entire LFC career, he has only ""missed"" a penalty once in all competitions - when his shot was saved by in form Tim Howard last fall. 

He works with and runs many charitable organizations in Liverpool. His family is well situated there and he does NOT want to leave.

His partnership with Suarez has been the most deadly so far. Last season under Kenny those two equally ripped the premier league apart.

He can score from distance, he's a great poacher in the box.

Which Muslims would you like to hear from? Those in the majority in the UK, those in the minority or those from overseas who are living in an Islamic run country? You'll find Muslims of all opinions wherever you look (assuming they're not afraid to speak their mind).

There are Muslims who will agree with the men who were convicted, of course, and in the UK I would say these guys are very likely in the extreme minority. But it's not completely clear as to why they are in the minority - it's not a simple case of ""Those guys are 'wrong'."", not when it comes to scripture.

I would say a good reason that most Muslims around here don't 'mind' gays, as such, would be because they live in the 'West', as it were. Homosexuality is not, in general, looked down on in the UK - it's not illegal, it's not underground, it's accepted as normal and rightly so (imo). Consider how many Islamic states deal with homosexuality - it's not exactly encouraged in a number of countries I can think of. That's not to say that the 'Mid-East' is backward, but rather homosexual rights have been fought for extensively in the UK etc. for decades now. There are movements in other (middle eastern) countries, but if you're going to imprisoned/killed for being gay then basic self preservation comes into play somewhat.

The reason for homosexuality being dealt with in such ways over yonder is exactly the reasons that (fundamental and not so fundamental) Christians also have a problem with it: There are sections of 'the book' that say it's bad.

Now of course the 'moderate' Muslim (i.e. reasonable), [such as someone who commented](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/oknd9/a_man_who_handed_out_a_leaflet_calling_for/c3i2nx7) on this story the other day condemning the protagonists, will argue that these men are mis-interpreting the scripture and that it *really* says to ""love everyone"" or similar. Of course, the Bible says exactly the same if you look in the right place, and I don't dispute that there are areas of the Qur'an etc. that *do* say the same thing quite clearly: ""Love everyone"". This is testament to how many people are happy to ""get on"" with anyone and everyone.    
However... One must ask oneself *why* there are Muslims who would call for (or heavily imply that) gays to be subject to the death penalty. Similarly we ask ourselves why would people who called themselves Muslims flew planes into the Twin Towers. And why there are people who identify as Christians killing doctors who perform abortions.

It is because they feel justified. For whatever reason, they have a bit of scripture that gives them the reasoning to kill various types of people, or people engaged in a particular practice. Christians can call for the death of gays too: Leviticus is quite clear that gays should be stoned to death.

But other Christians will point out that Leviticus is Old Testament and that Jesus has revised the law. And then someone can point out that Jesus said that the old law still stands. And someone can point out the Jesus said ""Love each other"" and ""He who is without sin, cast the first stone."" And then someone else will point out that... You get the idea.

My knowledge of Islam is limited, but I have no doubt that the Qur'an etc. is subject to similar problems of differing interpretation for specific parts of the scripture. There are, I believe, passages that call for the death of unbelievers (doesn't matter *why* - it's there). There are also places that call for the death of apostates. It *doesn't matter* that these areas are subject to contention - the fact is that they *are* being used to justify killing and have been... however long you want.

So... are these Muslims 'wrong'? It depends where you're coming from. As I happen to think that no-one deserves death for whatever reason, then yes I think they are wrong. But are they 'wrong' in terms of what Islam is all about? Well I don't think anyone can really say one way or the other though there will be a consensus. Of course people outside of the religion will very likely side in a particular direction, but the fact will always remain that the scripture can be taken either way, if you want it to. That's one of the problems with 'divine' scripture.

Where does this leave us? Well in my opinion I think it's important that we avoid the ""No True Scotsman"" fallacies and point them out when they appear. Obviously various religions *can* be used to justify many unsavoury things, as they sometimes are today (here) and extensively in the past. We should be 'fighting' at grass roots, as it were. The best weapon against this kind of [religious] sentiment is education and actually that's a good reason that faith schools really should be opposed. Even if most CoE schools are moderate in their approach, there's always those that are more extreme (lying about evolution etc.) as well as avoiding things like sex education, or telling children that sex outside of marriage is wrong/sinful or that homosexuality is evil. As it happens it's very easy to argue against any religious point regarding why homosexuality is 'wrong' apart from when their god is invoked. ""My god says it's wrong"" can be countered with scripture only, I think, and as I pointed out above that's a stalemate really. The atheist argument: ""Well I don't believe in your god so it means sod all to me. Leave the kids and everyone else alone!"" doesn't really work.

I've rambled slightly, but the overall point to take is: While we might find some aspects of religion distasteful, the fact remains that many people will use their religion to either justify or hold prejudice.

That's what millions of people do and will be doing in about 6 hours from now.

To many people use the excuse ""no jobs around here"". There is a simple solution to that.

You have the ability to take a train to somewhere else. You have done so in the past. I spend 37% of my monthly pay cheque on travel. The remaining 63% is a lot more then I would earn claiming JSA.

You could easily earn £800 a month in a retail job. You currently earn £212. If you were to spend half your pay on travel, that would leave you with £400. Almost double what you are earning now.

I am sorry, but you choice not to look for work further afield. That's the problem. People expect jobs in the local area.

Who are we do decide what people do or do not think is OK? Obviously I don't think gays should be killed and really ain't in favour of these guys and their actions at all. But I think the best way to go about eradicating homophobia is through education (and one of the reasons I oppose faith schools is because of issues like this) but that's not an immediate solution.

I imagine this is why there is a law regarding incitement to violence and why, I assume, anyone who is taken to court for such a thing has a chance to justify their reasoning behind saying such a thing.

So... We would not automatically have the right to say ""I think X should be put to death."", but we do if we can justify it?

So our freedom of speech in the UK is limited due to our not being able to justify a call for someone/a group to be killed, as I'm not sure anyone can do that. Mind you I imagine that various groups/papers have said ""The death penalty needs to be introduced for paedophiles. The difference would be that society cares less for paedos, plus they're criminals and seen as 'wrong'.

Of course I can see the reasoning behind the law and tend to agree with it, but there are people who would (hopefully in this thread because I want to talk to them!) see this whole law as being a violation of free speech and so should be removed, even though the reasoning behind it is somewhat sound so far as it goes.",0,1327107879,null,0,false,0,c3j1784,t3_op3l5,t1_c3j1784,t1_c3j0ydy,null,1428212002,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Pharmacy assistants can dispense certain drugs under the supervision of the pharmacist, but they do not have the option to exercise clinical judgement in the same way as the pharmacist, and have to stick to the letter of the guidance to avoid the pharmacist getting sued or diciplined.

I had a similar job working in the BT call centre that 999s are routed through before they get to the ambulance / police / fire dispatcher, the operator who asks you which emergency service you need.
That wasn't a nice job either,  even getting one of those 3 words out of a panicking, drunk or abusive individual, often with strong regional accents was very difficult at times.
Essentially we were there as a filter to stop pocket calls, toddlers mashing phone keypads, faulty lines  (a line with some kinds of fault will dial numbers on its own, repeatedly, for hours on end) and perverts calling to find a female to ask about her underwear etc. from reaching the actual emergency dispatcher.

I worked there 7 years ago and I sincerely hope things on the London ambulance service have improved, one christmas eve I had a caller on the line for 45 minutes just trying to connect to a dispatcher, repeatedly cycling through the secondary and tertiary connection lines while supervisors constantly called their management to see WTF was happening.

Possibly the most heart-breaking call I had was from an elderly woman who told me she wanted the police as she'd been kidnapped, was being held in an unfamiliar place by people who would not let her leave. The address came back as a nursing home, and shortly afterwards a nurse came on apologising the lady had got confused and had just forgotten she lived there.
Since the caller asked for the police I was obligated to call them independently to inform them of the call, give the address etc. The nurse said she did this every time she got chance to use a phone :(

We took 100 (operator services) reverse charges, faults and other miscellaneous calls too. Any type of call could come through next, you only got 2 'DING's in your ear first if it was a '9s' call.
Some of the callers on 100 were tragic too, some people called asking what day it is, or whether today is a bank holiday, or how to spell things, crossword clues they were stuck on, mostly old people wanting someone to talk to, you'd hear other operators spelling the same word for the same person minutes after you'd had a call about it yourself.

By far the worst part about it was the shift pattern though, the guy in the article with his nights / days switching is pretty bad but I was a 'temp' contractor like many others just used as manpower polyfilla for the permanent workers. We worked 4 day weeks 10 hour shifts with no scheduled 'downtime' which isn't so bad except it was never the same 4 days- on and of days were sprinkled randomly over the week. Sometimes you'd get 6 days off in a row if 6 'off' days magically aligned, but the inverse is also true- the worst stretch I had was 80 hours work over 9 days.
After 3AM we were allowed to read a book while not on calls as it was mostly quiet. As you might expect pub kicking-out time was a bit manic.

Waking up at 2 in the afternoon on your day off, knowing you have to sit awake until at least 3am so as not to completely fuck yourself over and get some daylight time before the following day's 8pm start got depressing very quickly.

It paid £7.50 an hour for nights, £9 on sundays, after I finished uni it was the best paid work I could find so I stayed there 10 months.


**TL;DR:** 999 calls don't go straight to the fire/police/ambulance, there's a room full of insomniac BT employees in the middle who route them, I used to be one.

**ProTip:** if you say nothing else, just say which service you need to the operator clearly as you can, help will come.",0,1327159945,null,0,true,0,c3j65em,t3_oq2uj,t1_c3j65em,t3_oq2uj,null,1428214335,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

I don't think it was that clear cut, not on my reading anyway. It's possible that the council were being overprotective here, but we can't really know without more detail. I presume they felt strongly, since they tried to stop the cruise, the question is whether they do this automatically, or whether they have valid concerns. We can't know that. Again, I don't necessarily think they were right to try and stop it, but I can see why they were concerned.

The CFC PR machine is always talking how good our academy kids are, and here we are buying Cahill (who may be the next Terry for us, who knows?) instead of recalling Bruma who has been on fire in Germany so far (who could also be the next Terry, who knows?). And why is Sturrige constantly playing as winger/striker/ACM when he is clearly an in the box CF?

AVB is attempting to shoe horn everyone into his system, instead of adapting the formation to suit everyone's individual strengths. Lampard remains the  glue that holds that midfield together, and woe be us if he is out injured for more than a week.

*Woman with dementia allowed out of care home in custody of elderly man*

SOCIAL SERVICES were scrambling yesterday to explain how an elderly dementia sufferer was allowed out of her care home...for a 16 DAY CRUISE in the custody of an equally elderly man.

'We don't know how this happened, but we're shocked' said an unnamed family member. 'We though when she went in to care, we wouldn't have to worry about her wandering over to the next street, much less a world cruise!'

The woman, 82, was said to have been released into the custody of an unnamed 81-year-old man.  The man is said to have convinced the care home staff that they 'always went on cruises together', despite the fact that the man was unable to care for her, except for one to two day stretches.

'How they let her leave the country, for two weeks, without the council lifting a finger to look after her welfare simply boggles the mind', said a person close to the case, who chose not to be identified. 'What does ""care"" mean, if anyone can run away with you at a moment's notice? He wasn't even her husband, he wasn't even family.  If you have someone in care, I urge you to make absolutely sure the care home knows not to let them go off on their own, or in the custody of someone just as vulnerable'.

This case, according to an unnamed expert, simply proves that Britain's care system is not fit for purpose. 'The fact is, these care professionals would rather be cozying up to criminal kids, than act in the interest of a pensioned, to prevent her being taken advantage of. Why they didn't do everything in their power to make sure she was kept safe and out of harm's way, is simply beyond me.'

There's a reason multi-Doctor episodes have to remain infrequent and rare; if they didn't, it would completely lose its novelty. I remember either Tennant or RTD saying something along the lines of multi-Doctor plots running the risk of being more about the actors than the story, which is a strong case for straying away from them.

I agree that Sturridge should be CF. However, his stats on the wing are quite good (although he was shit today) and we dont really have options on the wings. We need to pickup a winger good enough to push Sturridge over to CF.

true,consensualbestiality,null,null,"When I was but a wee lad, I went to the library one Saturday morning. There was a hotdog cart outside, so I purchased myself one, and was thoroughly enjoying myself. Since I couldn't take food into the library, I decided to take a stroll around the building. Halfway around, I noticed a weird crunch of gravel behind me. I turned, and there was the most beautiful white peacock I'd ever seen, following me. I took a few steps towards the gorgeous thing, when all of the sudden, I heard a voice in my head. The voice was none other than Scott Baio, who acts as my common sense usually, for reasons I'm not entirely sure of. Scott Baio said just 8 little words, but they made my blood run cold: ""Are you sure he wants to be friends?"" I looked deep into the peacock's eyes, and realized two things simultaneously: First, he did not, in fact, wish to be friends, and second, he was a soulless abomination from the depths of hell, sent to feast on the flesh of young innocents. 

So I ran. In fact, I screamed like a woman and ran. And the peacock gave chase. Now, for rather large, somewhat gangly-looking birds, they can actually move at quite a clip on land. As the peacock closed, I realized I was still holding the cursed hotdog in my hand! Ah-ha! I thought to myself! The peacock is after the food. I risked a glance over my shoulder, saw the peacock was still gaining on me, and chucked the hotdog off at a ninety degree angle to my escape route. ""Surely this will get this accursed devil-fowl off my trail!"" I thought. But alas, no. 

The peacock never even glanced at the hotdog. It just kept coming straight at me. Memory can be a bit vague and uncertain, but if birds do have tongues, I am 100% certain it licked its bony non-lips in anticipation of its upcoming meal of little boy meat. 

At this point, I started sobbing, and ran off the trail, up to the windows of the library, where people were inside reading and whatnot. I banged on the window, screaming bloody murder as I heard the crunch of approaching talons on the gravel. A couple people looked up, but nobody seemed to care, not one bit. 

I turned around to face my fate, just as the peacock attacked. The rest is kind of a blur of sharp beak pecks, talons trying to gut me, and the awful, awful warbling battle cry peacocks make as they feast on the flesh of the living, which to this day haunts my nightmares. 

Finally an old lady from the library came out with a broom and shooed it away. I was crying and bleeding. I needed 4 stitches. I never got to finish my hotdog. 

To this day, I'm TERRIFIED of peacocks.

true,michael_ellis_day,null,null,"I think skpkzk2 had something different in mind -- not a multi-Doctor story at all, but one in which his having already been present at an event is a plot point.  For instance, ""I must avoid going somewhere/doing something precisely because I am already there earlier in my timeline, therefore I have to find another way of accomplishing my goal.""  

In *The Shakespeare Code* [spoiler](/s ""Queen Elizabeth showing up enraged at the Doctor"") implied he was due to head back to that approximate time and place sometime later in his own history.  

In *Battlefield* [spoiler](/s ""everyone recognizes the Doctor as Merlin, and then he finds a note from his future self revealing he was Merlin."")  

Yes, these were both cases involving the same incarnation of the Doctor crossing his own path, not two incarnations, but that's irrelevant.

But Moffat definitely has a bit of a crush on the last few seasons - which were actually excellent seasons.

That whole concept of the Doctor as the brilliant, manipulative chess player is mirrored from Seven to Eleven (and never demonstrated more directly than the end of A Christmas Carol). There are even some of the same plot concepts being played out. Much as Seven breaks Ace's faith in him to defeat Fenric, Eleven breaks Amy's faith in him in the God Complex. And Ace's very existence as his companion is the result of time manipulation, just like Amy came to travel with The Doctor for the same reason.

You can even dip into the extended universe, where the idea was for The Doctor to shape Ace into a Time Lady. Close enough, we have River. And now, there's this whole question of who The Doctor really is, and why he is such a singularly important Time Lord.

Present : In the absence of a good DM, our defenders don't take the risk and pass it upwards even in slightly risky situations and wait for clear gaps to form. With in-form Lucas out, and Adam/Hendo both naturally attacking midfielders, this situation will surely worsen.

But I took an instant dislike to the guy, not for his politics but because he made a point of using the longest words he could find in the dictionary to make himself sound educated. prick.

In terms of the video content, he was hating on a guy who offered an alternative viewpoint to the one reported in the mainstream press.  If you view every 'political' event in NI, through the lens that each side is trying to have its 'version' of the events publicised then you would probably say that there is probably no absolute truth only opinions.

Anyway this Unionist guy didnt do himself any favours and this dude did his upmost to utterly dismiss the comments suggesting an alternative view of events, but i feel he let himself down somewhat with his really angry personality.

The unionist bloke was doing that thing that unionists here seem to love to do, defend the undefensible.. they need to sit back and realise that a core element of 'loyalism' and working class unionism is to hate and get on like pricks... in the village they hate catholics more than the Westboro's hate the gays.... anyway.. his tweets suggested that there was more to it than just some film crew getting a totally unprovoked kicking, suggested that this lad was more than just some kid doing some work, mentioned his dad who was a notorious 'RA man back in the day, suggested that it wasnt sectarian, suggested that there were drugs involved... offering several conflicting stories to excuse some kid getting a kicking, he then proceeded to get on like a complete knob on twitter.

hence this guy's video, utterly dismissing that there may be different shades of truth.. Surprising really when it doesnt look like the dude in the video had been in the Village and probably has lived a very comfortable middle class life in the bandit-country that is Moira.

I don't know the truth, I do know that someone got a beating and it's not going to help Belfast become the Hollywood of western europe.  Bunch of cnuts.

As much as I am disappointed with the performance of our players tonight, Dalglish's starting 11, choice of tactics, and transfers have been suspect on more than one occasion this season. Frankly, I am not happy with a single player he has brought to the club, with the exception of Bellamy (you know, the guy who we got for free), who while brilliant, cannot play for 90 minutes on a weekly basis. 

The remainder of his purchases have combined for a paltry handful of goals and only a few more assists. It's pathetic and in any other industry, a manager who produced results like this would be on his arse. 

I'm not saying that we should be sacking KD yet, but I consider him to be on thin ice. FSG made it clear that failing to achieve Champions League this season would be considered a massive disappointment for the club. If we maintain this form, we will wind up as an overpriced mid-table team.

I mean, I *could* sit here and try to wade through all this crap, figure out what I'm supposed to do myself and then tell my Facebook feed with very little confidence how to do their part to act against ACTA. . . but somehow that doesn't seem like it would be a very effective strategy. We need someone to break this crap down - I'm 23, not American, and I've never written to an MP before or even voted for that matter. Seriously, apart from my usual outraged intellectual masturbation, what the fuck do I do ?

Edit: Okay, so apparently this is what you do:

- Pick someone from [this list](https://www.laquadrature.net/wiki/MEPs_INTA). These guys are on the International Trade (""INTA"") Committee of the European Parliament. INTA gathers reports from the other committees, then compiles them into their own report to give to parliament. Opinions from concerned citizens need to be included in this report, and that means you! So contact them about your concerns. Email or phone or whatever!

Oh but wait a minute, you say! I *am* concerned, but up until now that was only because ACTA was compared to SOPA and I know that SOPA is bad and then this video with all the evil stuff and the offputting narration and ACTA is bad too, right guys? Right!? Well . . . have I got the thing for you!

- Read [this](http://www.laquadrature.net/en/acta-updated-analysis-of-the-final-version)! It's a criticism of ACTA. If you roll over the little superscript numbers you even get the actual text from ACTA itself, which is nice. 

Well actually it's more confusing than nice, because the ACTA text looks really innocent and harmless compared to the criticism of it. 

ACTA Article 27.3, for example, asks the signing party to ""endeavour to promote cooperative efforts within the business community to effectively address trademark and copyright related rights infringements while preserving legitimate competition and fundamental principles such as freedom of expression, fair process, and privacy."" 

Which of course really means that ""police and justice missions could be handed out to private actors, bypassing judicial authority and the right to a fair trial."" 

""Wait, what?!"" I hear you say. . . well just think about it for a second. I have. Hm, skip on to the other criticisms maybe, because the ACTA text behind a few of those other ones do actually sound dodgy.

So you've got a little of bundle of arguments in hand ready to contact your MEP.

- Now read [this](http://www.laquadrature.net/wiki/How_to_act_against_ACTA)! It's basically the page I got all my information off, but you'll actually understand it now. Plus, my lighthearted tone won't rub the right way with the MEP's assistant on the phone. You have to be *concerned*. This article has everything I said and more, in just the right tone to turn you back in to a concerned citizen.

For the 2012 Daleks, I think you have to remember that Daleks are a time traveling species. So, it's possible for them to change history. In 2012 no one had seen a Dalek, then they went back in time and inserted their presence before 2012. 

I think the Mondas cybermen were there for nostalgia sake. It's a big universe; the Doctor could have thought they were dead when they weren't. 

The Doctor simply forgot about Silence whenever he saw them. Before that, they weren't a threat to him, and they never left any evidence of their presence. That is, until they kidnapped River and she called the president. With that first piece of evidence, 11 was able to piece together their history.

It's absolutely impossible that RTD wrote his series planning for the Tardis to explode and alter timelines. It's possible that Moffat would want to use it to retcon previous plotholes, but there is no positive proof. All it would have required would be two lines of dialogue.

""So the universe is the same as before, Doctor?""

Bosingwa is not the same player he used to be. He's almost too scared to tackle now with his knees the way they are, and while he does have pace, without a proper cross it's all a waste. Cole wasn't all that bad though, I mean, we kept a clean sheet and he had a pretty busy day in the attacking half. Not everything was fantastic but not out of character with the rest of the team.

Had hope to see Cahill too but maybe next week. I don't think it's realistic to think Luiz will play RB, I don't he ever has his entire career. I believe he has some experience as a LB, but the man's a CB and that's where he'll play. If he was the solution to our RB problem, I'm sure AVB would have tried that already.

&gt; 2) Torres should have had double the amount of chances today. 

Yeah. The man's in some serious dips of confidence right now. I wish he'd take on more shoots and also stop thinking about it so much. I think if he relied more on his instincts he'd have more success. With regards to your fourth point, I agree. He needs to hit some goals in successive games and really boost his confidence. His attitude looks good though, much better than the early CFC days.

Sturridge is not a proper winger, I thought he might be almost a like-for-like replacement for Anelka, but he's a CF. Maybe he'll mature into the position, but in the meantime, we should get a proper wide player to take his spot, and play Studge in the middle.


&gt; 3) I understand the thought behind the initial midfield three but I would have loved to see Romeu instead of Meireles so Lamps and Ramires could push higher upfield.

I actually think it was right to sit Romeu for this game. He's looked a little dull the last few games, and this is his first season at the highest level, so maybe a rest will do him well. Also, I don't think we really needed that defensive specialist for this game, so we could afford to play a more robust midfield. 

I think the decision to wait on the Meireles sub had more to do with Essien's fitness than Meireles; don't want to give him too many minutes, he has been out for a long time.

The Angel would have to approach the Silent from behind, obviously. If the Silent does not recognize that an Angel is behind it, it dies. Simple. However, once the Silent sees the Angel, it is a trivial matter to escape. The Angel will freeze, and the Silent can easily keep the Angel in its sight until it is out of the room or otherwise out of the Angels vision.

All depends when you call though, if there's footy on or the clubs are turning out you're not likely to get through very quickly. 45 seconds seems a long time when the adrenalin is raging, I guess.

An operator will stay on the line until the dispatcher answers, and if he/she judges that the caller is likely to struggle to communicate with them due to being old / young / distressed /drunk / angry+shouting the operator stays silently on the line until the very end. Sometimes the dispatcher would actually request you to mute the caller and take details such as phone number and registered address from the operator instead.

if you call from a BT landline the operator instantly has your address, which means they can call the police and pass that on no matter what else happens. I was shocked to learn that if a line was registered with another company and the caller disconnected before confirming the address we actually had to call the 3rd party supplier and check the details before calling the police, just in case BT had not been made aware of a change to the subscriber details. Hope that's not still the case as vital minutes wasted on the phone to Virgin or NTL could have made a difference to lives.

If you call from a mobile the system gave rough location co-ordinates presumably based on the cell mast(s) you were near to, which we could give the emergency services, so they almost always have something to go on.

The only exception to this is VoIP, there's no location data at all and no subscriber detail, if you absolutely have to call 999 using VoIP and the service supports emergency calls, make sure you give your location clearly.",0,1327201666,null,0,false,0,c3jc6e8,t3_oq2uj,t1_c3jc6e8,t1_c3j8rcj,null,1428217245,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Care to expand?

Of course, it's about numbers as I said.  It's hard to label as radical what most people believe.  It'd be interesting (and educational) to see how they'd spin a call for free markets as communism though...

&gt;There is absolutely nothing with copyright, patent or trademark laws.

Except they lead us to where we are now, and much much further down the line to fascism, as the future will undoubtedly demonstrate... (we'll revisit this no doubt).  They also have resulted and continue to result in untold death in the developing world.

But, given that in the classic series, a group of Time Lords could force another Time Lord to regenerate using their psychic abilities.

But, the situation with River is different. After all, she's human (mostly), but her biology was complicated by her conception. She's not a Time Lord, though she can regenerate. That's a Gallifreyan thing, along with the schizm in time and time-travelling spaceships.

Time Lords have to go through the Time Lord Academy before they can actually call themselves Time Lords.

Unless of course you don't understand double standards and what they are. It's fine for city supporters to say not all 2 footed challenges are red cards, but that doesn't mean they couldn't be, say, free kicks, or yellows. But the argument that was applied to Kompany's red card by the ref(s) and the tribunal who reviews the appeal, was that all two footed challenges are red cards.

true,Grigori7,english,London,"Dear Charles Tannock, Claude Moraes, Sarah Ludford, Marina
Yannakoudakis, Syed Kamall, Jean Lambert, Gerard Batten and Mary
Honeyball,

I am writing to inquire as to your stances on the Anti-Counterfeiting
Trade Agreement (ACTA). Given the recent developments in the USA
concerning both SOPA and PIPA, I would appreciate a transparent
response explaining exactly what similarities and differences ACTA
possesses when compared to these two acts.

My concerns thus far are as follows:

- The debate and voting on this act have, thus far, appeared to be
handled in an extremely secretive manner. This does not appear to be
fair, democratic process to me.

- ACTA fails to define what ""counterfeiting"" and ""piracy"" actually are.
One of the main concerns surrounding SOPA and PIPA have been that its
wording is vague, and that such ambiguity has no place in legislation
due to its facilitation of abuse.

- ACTA would give each country's government the right to disconnect
citizens' access to the Internet based on accusations rather than legal
process. This is a practice that the British public associates with
despots, and rightly so.

- ACTA will permit legal action to be taken against individuals if
rightsholders claim that infringement is ""imminent"". I would very much
like to know how anyone could support such a claim.

- Acts such as PIPA, SOPA, and ACTA will generate Human Rights abuses.
Scott Edwards, Director of the Science for Human Rights programme at
Amnesty International, recently stated that while governments should
protect their citizens' right to have their intellectual property
protected, acts such as these will ""generate a powerful and
unprecedented market incentive to censor user generated content."" This
incentive will obviously hinder the development of original creative
content, as well as increasing the barriers to any grassroots
organisation with an Internet-based business.

In short, ACTA runs the risk of destroying younger generations' faith
in their representatives. We do not want to have to abide by a
cosmopolitan law that we had no say in agreeing to, especially when
that law inhibits our free access to information. We do not want to see
the Internet, the greatest repository of knowledge that has ever
existed, be crippled by industry-driven fear. I do not wish to one day
tell my children about the time when one could freely link to content
online without fear of reprisal.

Piracy is obviously a problem, but it is a problem that must be
confronted in a manner that does infringe upon our rights.

Thank you in advance for your responses.

Yours sincerely,

There's a good chance that they'll point out that those who do not believe as they do are going to suffer divine judgement and likely burn forever in hell.

That makes some people feel very uneasy. After all, it's not nice. However the uneasy people don't have the 'right' not to be made to feel uneasy. Similar to 'offence' - people don't have the right not to feel offended. The world would be a ridiculous place if it were and would cater to the most shallow and prudish people.

&gt; Secondly through encouragement comes action

Yes, I think that's the one and only point of reason: that implying a group deserves death can't be defended by the 'free speech' as it can *only* be justified by acknowledging that you are trying to encourage for these people to be killed, whether that be lawfully or unlawfully (let's ignore the people who are saying ""Kill XX!"" simply to make a point about free speech). This doesn't limit debate on the topic, I think, as it's possible for MPs to raise the question in the house and be free from prosecution. How one would lobby an MP to do that is another matter.

There is one issue though: one could argue that any particular ideology might result in encouragement to the same ends. The preacher(s) I mention above: one can easily move from ""deserve hell"" to ""do not deserve to live this life as you are"". Would we stop it before it got there? It's a historic reason for killing heretics etc. after all: ""He/She is acting against the will of our god! Do not suffer a witch to live! etc.""     
Some people even say that an atheist is someone who does not think that life is important (or 'sacred') and so is more likely to kill people themselves and/or encourage it. They would therefore say that anyone who identifies as an atheist should be stopped from speaking, or spreading their (non) belief, perhaps by putting those people to death. To them, that would be 'nipping it in the bud' before it gets going.

It sounds unbelievable, especially to a paranoid Londoner who rarely lets her own children out of sight. Two days later I have gone native and my daughters are playing outside ""alone"" – well kind of; I'm hovering on the doorstep.

&gt; From my vantage point I notice several blanket-covered prams left outside houses and am amazed to learn that there are sleeping babies in them. Unsupervised! Outside! Can you imagine that happening here? It did happen in New York a decade ago, when a Danish mother left her daughter outside a restaurant while she ate inside. She was arrested and narrowly escaped jail for child neglect and abandonment.

City is looking the better side (or at least the more complete side), their attacking play is usually good. It's lucky for us that we've been excellent in our defensive play so far, and I must say that King has been extraordinary for me (Benny has been lacking off a bit, but he's hopefully shaping up).

Our presence up front leaves much more to be asked though, and I'm getting the feel of the United away game... We will be able to play good and equal to City for 60 minutes, then end up losing 3-0...

It was good to see that our free-flowing passing game was back from the start this game (unlike the last game like Wolves where we never got any flow going at all).

The Kaboul free-kick was unnecessary, really, I would rather have Rafa taking it or maybe the same variant but Bale trying to get a shot off. Rafa had some good opportunities but was blocked twice by the defenders.

I'm hoping for a good second half, but I'm afraid it may end with a loss. We need to push up Bale and Lennon more, get them to create chances, 'cause Defoe will never win any 1-on-1 versus this team, especially not a heading duel. *inb4Defoescores1-0withaheaderfromacorner*

[I tend to agree with Peter Tatchell on that front](http://www.petertatchell.net/free_speech/cps-drop-case-against-street-preacher.htm), that it was 'good' that he was not convicted/taken to court. I think that's the right thing to do - he was expressing an opinion without any conclusions as to how such sinners should be dealt with, if at all.

From discussions I've had before on reddit, I'm of the opinion the freedom of speech should extend up to but not include inciting or encouraging violence against an individual or group. Of course taking that to its logical conclusion I'd have to include paedophiles in that, but I imagine that most people condemn violence of any kind, even if it's 'understandable'.

I realise you might be wondering why the hell I was asking questions if I'm actually in agreement with you, but often people say ""It shouldn't be allowed!"" without giving a decent reason so I sometimes like to check, particularly as I wasn't entirely sure why myself when I started the thread. People would say similar of the street preacher mentioned here, but I for one - even though I'm massively pro-gay rights and do the odd protest in support - don't think religious people should be silenced for disagreeing with such lifestyles. That doesn't mean I don't think they should be countered, of course, but they should be allowed to express dissent.

Balotelli surely stomped on Parker by intention (maybe not his *head* by intention, but that where the foot touches). Should have been a red card there. Then he would never have gotten the penalty either...

Oh, the penalty. Is the English rules different from the Europe rules? 'Cause I remember Milan-Barcelona when Messi took a penalty, he stopped and waited out the Milan keeper - it is a bookable offence. It is a yellow card. And what did Balotelli do? He stopped. Should have been his third yellow card right there... Definitely a red.

I won't type any ""fucks"" because there aren't enough of them to express what I feel. Damn, Ledley, you fucked up your own record...

**Edit:** Fucking stomp on Parker should have been an instant red.

*Correction:* Balotelli should have gotten 2 yellows -&gt; 1 red, and 1 instant red. Summarise that, 2 red cards. Instead he gets to score the win from a FAULTY PENALTY (Europe rules)! ""The beautiful game""? Today I lost some respect to football as well. FUCK!

**Edit 2:** From Wikipedia:

""After the referee blows his whistle, which is the signal for the kick to be taken, the kicker must kick the ball in a forward direction (not necessarily at the goal, though this is almost always the case). **The ball must be kicked after a run-up by the taker, who may slow or stop his run during the run-up** but may not feint when he is on the point of kicking the ball (""paradinha,"" Portuguese for ""little stop"").[1] If the taker scores after violating this rule, the kick must be re-taken and the kicker must be cautioned for unsporting behavior.""

**Edit 2:** From Wikipedia:

""After the referee blows his whistle, which is the signal for the kick to be taken, the kicker must kick the ball in a forward direction (not necessarily at the goal, though this is almost always the case). **The ball must be kicked after a run-up by the taker, who may slow or stop his run during the run-up** but may not feint when he is on the point of kicking the ball (""paradinha,"" Portuguese for ""little stop"").[1] If the taker scores after violating this rule, the kick must be re-taken and the kicker must be cautioned for unsporting behavior.""

Look at the [Home Office homicide statistics](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/crime-research/hosb0212/), of the approximately 5,000 under-16 deaths in the UK in 2010/11 (of any type, the vast majority medical), 6 were homicides committed by someone unknown to the child and 7 by ""Other family(non-parent)/friend/acquaintance"". I cannot find the officially stated motives for these specific homicides, but there are several news reports of quarrel related deaths, and the lack of any reports of sexually motivated killings leads to me to believe none that year had a ""stranger danger"" sexual origin.

By comparison, in [2008](http://www.rospa.com/homesafety/Info/child-accidents-2008.pdf) there were 91 road deaths and 17 Drowning/Choking/Suffocation deaths  (stats for under 15s rather than under 16s).

Jewelry, especially necklaces, consistently cause more child deaths than pedophiles. Yet over recent decades as ""stranger danger"" fears have increased, so has the proportion of children owning and regularly wearing jewelry. It highlights just how irrational and misplaced parental fears are.

true,Grigori7,english,London,"Dear Charles Tannock, Claude Moraes, Sarah Ludford, Marina
Yannakoudakis, Syed Kamall, Jean Lambert, Gerard Batten and Mary
Honeyball,

I am writing to inquire as to your stances on the Anti-Counterfeiting
Trade Agreement (ACTA). Given the recent developments in the USA
concerning both SOPA and PIPA, I would appreciate a transparent
response explaining exactly what similarities and differences ACTA
possesses when compared to these two acts.

My concerns thus far are as follows:

- The debate and voting on this act have, thus far, appeared to be
handled in an extremely secretive manner. This does not appear to be
fair, democratic process to me.

- ACTA fails to define what ""counterfeiting"" and ""piracy"" actually are.
One of the main concerns surrounding SOPA and PIPA have been that its
wording is vague, and that such ambiguity has no place in legislation
due to its facilitation of abuse.

- ACTA would give each country's government the right to disconnect
citizens' access to the Internet based on accusations rather than legal
process. This is a practice that the British public associates with
despots, and rightly so.

- ACTA will permit legal action to be taken against individuals if
rightsholders claim that infringement is ""imminent"". I would very much
like to know how anyone could support such a claim.

- Acts such as PIPA, SOPA, and ACTA will generate Human Rights abuses.
Scott Edwards, Director of the Science for Human Rights programme at
Amnesty International, recently stated that while governments should
protect their citizens' right to have their intellectual property
protected, acts such as these will ""generate a powerful and
unprecedented market incentive to censor user generated content."" This
incentive will obviously hinder the development of original creative
content, as well as increasing the barriers to any grassroots
organisation with an Internet-based business.

In short, ACTA runs the risk of destroying younger generations' faith
in their representatives. We do not want to have to abide by a
cosmopolitan law that we had no say in agreeing to, especially when
that law inhibits our free access to information. We do not want to see
the Internet, the greatest repository of knowledge that has ever
existed, be crippled by industry-driven fear. I do not wish to one day
tell my children about the time when one could freely link to content
online without fear of reprisal.

Piracy is obviously a problem, but it is a problem that must be
confronted in a manner that does not infringe upon our rights.

Thank you in advance for your responses.

Yours sincerely,

We lived on a nice street, however next door we had a rehabilitation halfway house with junkies living in it, they spotted us a mile off and some dunce who lived with us let them IN to use our toilet (??).    The next night, someone hopped over the glass covered wall and stole all the beer keeping cool in the garden, and put a hammer through the kitchen window (we had iron bars luckily).    Two doors down, a friend of mines house was broken into when they advertised on facebook about a party, like you - four peoples laptops and electricals were stolen. The kids all had insurance (**Something unis are supposed to push you to do - ours always made us sign up for it**).    Luckily for them, the police also caught the buggers trying to sell them in a gumtree sting.    So yes, without insurance the police will be pretty unhelpful, but that's what you get.    Unfortunately, it all reverts to who you think has been watching you and how obvious you make it to locals that you're students.

true,Mimsy_borogoves,hampshire,Hampshire,"Me and my flatmates were in a similar situation and just so you know this story won't hold any advice, plus I was either asleep or at uni when the events unfolded. Also sorry in advance if this a long'un.

So it was 4am on a Wednesday morning, none of us had gone out the night before and so none of us would have left our floor door unlocked and by this time we were all in our rooms asleep. One of my flatmates is woken up by a knock on her door. Thinking it was one of the lads pissing about she gets to answer the door to tell them to piss off. She opens the door to see a dishevelled man in his late 30's standing in her doorframe. ""Where's Danny?"" He asked.

Seeing as there is no Danny or Daniel on our floor she quickly tells him to ask the warden, a third year, who just so happens to be living on the same floor as us. She locks her door. This strange man does this to a couple of other doors, scaring the life out of another girl and funnily enough one of the big guys on my floor too. So the three of them end up not sleeping or leaving their rooms and texting people about what just happened. I slept through the entire situation. 

Bring the morning and the warden and most of the guys are sat in the common room around the spot where the telly used to be. The police were called and told about the theft of the telly and also two pairs of trainers that belonged to on of the guys. I just join the conversation about how shit the whole situation is and how on earth the guy got in considering the door to our floor locks once closed and so does the entrance to our building and only we have the keys to our floor and none were missing, nor was there a sign of forced entry.

Anyway I go to uni, and come back to mostly everybody that lives on my floor with an interesting story to tell. Just a couple of hours after I'd left our thief had made his way back to our floor and he'd brought a friend. This was about 11am and there were still quite a few people still in the flat. So they're standing there in the corridor, nobody saw them come in, but they had obviously just got in because they were close to the door. At this point none of my flatmates had realised that one of them was the same guy who'd taken the telly. They're both barely standing because they're on something and that's when one guys notices something familiar, they're both wearing the exact same trainers that went missing from the night before. So he starts asking ""Nice trainers mate, where'd you get them?"" 

They both reply ""Our mum.""

They very quickly feel very conspicuous and just run down the stairs and out the flat with some of the guys giving chase. Luckily an off duty bobby is in the right place at the right time and catches one of the guys and asks him what he's on. In the end they caught the other guy, turns out it was his brother and they'd done a quick sell of the telly, but now they're in jail.

The worst part of all this is that our landlord was a complete cunt throughout all of this. Turns out a set of keys from one of the past tenants hadn't been handed back and he didn't chase it up because the tenant was a ""nice girl."" Plus he told us, through the warden, that the police had rang up saying that they'd found a pair of picks on one of the guys, and definitely no sign of keys. Not trusting him, the guy that had his trainers nicked rang the police up, gave them his unique victim code (whatever its called) and asked if there had been an update with the case. Turns out the officer in charge of the case was off duty that day and that the picks didn't exist. Furthermore our landlord also went to the student union and told them we'd let the guy in the first time and the second time they'd climbed in through an open window. We live on the 3rd floor (To any Americans lost in this subreddit, that's the 4th floor to you).

Anyway everything was sorted, we got a new telly and compensation was given to the guy who lost his trainers. I have a feeling though that the police were only so useful by fluke because that one off-duty bobby happened to be in the right place at the right time and so got the ball rolling with the case.

true,FreddyDeus,yorkshire,Ayup,"£34,763 per annum would give you a net annual income of almost precisely £26,000 (give or take 84p).

In 2011 the average annual earnings for an individual were £26,000 a year *GROSS*. Giving you a net income of £20,042.

Of course, that figure is the median average income, which is not reflective of the kinds of income most people earn.

The mean average income is £22,000 a year GROSS. This means that 50% of employed people in the UK earn £22,000 a year or less. This would be mean a NET income of around £17,322 a year.

So someone on benefits, even if they are capped, could come out with nearly ten thousand pounds a year more than the mean-average worker in the UK.

We called the police who came and took statements from the people who had their items stolen, and the two who were in at the time. Nothing much happened after that.

We then started scouring the local pawn shops, and second hand stores, and after a two weeks of searching we found one of the DVDs (it was a limited edition and you could only buy it in Sweden), and eventually the rest of them. We called the police and they got the name and address of they guy who brought it in. The police confiscated the DVDs, dusted them and returned them. We also found the guitar in a local shop and had that returned to us (we never found the laptops or perfume).

The guy was found and bought in for questioning and is now going to court.

I love how you just hand wave away any concerns with 'you can use renewable energy if you want'. And you're asking what planet I live on?! The round trip efficiency of making, storing, transporting, and burning/electrolysis will never make sense. I've actually studied hydrogen power and renewable energy to a postgrad level, I work in the industry now, and I have done for several years. I didn't form this opinion lightly.

I agree with your last point. I fully support a high level of nuclear power and renewables to power the grid. Replacing petrol with hydrogen would take around 50 extra 1GW nuke plants, solely producing hydrogen. Just to let everyone continue their happy, carefree, motoring life. Never going to happen. Even if a commercial enterprise started manufacturing hydrogen for sale to the market place, it would have to compete with its own energy source, direct (green) grid electricity. Why would anyone buy hydrogen in this scenario? It's an inefficient energy carrier than will never make sense to consumers. 

Storage is also a complete nightmare. Hydrogen embrittlement. The low boiling point. Your fuel is literally boiling away when not in use. You'd go on holiday and come back to find half your fuel gone. 

The only way hydrogen will make sense is if we crack some 'easy', cheap form of nuclear fusion. Giving society so much surplus electricity we don't know what to do with it. We won't even have a single commercial fusion plant until at least the mid-part of the decade. If ever. We only need the equivalent of 4-5 nobel prize winning developments in science to happen concurrently for them even to start pouring the concrete.  

The future of transportation is electricity. Electric trolley buses, electric trains, electric distribution vehicles. What oil is left will be used for flying, trucking and food production.

Dear Sajjad Karim, Chris Davies, Jacqueline Foster, Nick Griffin, Arlene McCarthy, Paul Nuttall, Robert Atkins and Brian Simpson,

I am writing to you today about the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) which is currently being discussed and pushed through the European Union. I am concerned that one of the greatest inventions in human history, and as shown during the Arab springs last year one of the most powerful weapons we the people have, will be destroyed by regulations that are only in the vested interest of the few at the expense of the masses. 

Internet piracy is an issue and must be dealt with, but to enact ACTA would to be like combating shoplifting by locking the customer in a small cage with a number of security guards watching their every move ready to pounce if they even think that the customer is about to shoplift. The treaty would frankly be only useful to established companies in stopping any new company from taking their customers.

I urge you to protect free speech and the people's rights by standing up against this treaty.  

Thank you for reading.

Dear Catherine Bearder, Peter Skinner, Nirj Deva, Sharon Bowles, Nigel Farage, Keith Taylor and Marta Andreasen,

I am writing to you today in regards to ACTA - the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement.

I am aware of the need to protect intellectual property, as a freelance photographer I am more than aware of the damage copyright infringement can cause, however I have strong reservations about the method of enforcement conceived by ACTA.

I would like to know your positions in regards to this legislation and, additionally, if you support ACTA your reasons why.

My main arguments against ACTA are that;

ACTA creates enforcement agencies out of Internet Service Providers. This is a position they do not want and should not have. Enforcement should be done by the justice system and not private companies. This allows greater transparency, less bias and hopefully more inclination towards fair resolution. Additionally the added procedures that is required from ISPs to do this creates a significant barrier to entry for new ISPs which will stifle innovation and market competition.

The main parts of ACTA are the ""protection"" against 'counterfeiting' and 'piracy', and large powers are granted in the fight against them - however the document does not define these terms, allowing future businesses, politicians and courts to define these individually creating an inconsistent and undemocratic enforcement with wide ranging capabilities.

The internet has been called a Human Right by many and even the UN praises it's openness together with the ability for freedom of expression. (http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.27_en.pdf). ACTA defies this report by allowing fullscale disconnection from the Internet to ""offenders"" against it. This is made worse by the fact this can be done without due process.

Finally I would like to raise my biggest objection to this proposed treaty - the shady and secret history behind it. This treaty was drafted behind closed doors with hopes that it would not be released to the public until it was too late to stop it. This is completely unacceptable and means that those behind it know it is not wanted by the general populace. Your duty as elected representatives is to consider the will and needs of the population as a whole, not a small sector consisting of major corporations who finance backroom deals to help protect them.

The actions in the US with PIPA and SOPA recently show the backlash that can be felt when the general population realise what is being done against them by people they expect to represent them and I hope this can be avoided in the EU with a fair, democratic and balanced system.

I support the prevention of copyright infringement and counterfeiting goods but not at the expense of removal of democracy, freedom and due process from millions of people.

I await your responses in due course. 

Yours sincerely,
Ookware",0,1327262336,null,0,false,0,c3jinwl,t3_orglr,t1_c3jinwl,t1_c3jgx8e,null,1428220363,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,SexWithTwins,null,null,"This speaks to the next big shit storm in UK media.  The findings of the Leveson Inquiry are going to have repercussions way beyond print journalism.  The keyword here is Murdoch.  

Anyone who thinks he's going to forgive and forget for the ditching of his plans to wholly own BSkyB is deluded.  And since he also largely blames the BBC and Channel 4 for the sinking of Rebekah Brooks, and world's largest English language tabloid, he's now going to go after the licence fee with even more determination.  But he's playing a waiting game, because he knows full well about the potential to deliver a service viewers exactly like you and me want, but currently aren't getting.

We no longer have a TV licence, because we live on a tight enough budget as it is, without having to factor in the cost of occasionally glimpsing the news headlies and the odd episode of QI.  On top of that we're vociferously opposed to the idea of paying for Top Gear and Strictly Come Dancing, on the weak argument that it enables the BBC to carry on making The World at One and natural history documentaries.

We're also penalised by of the downside of not being able to (legally) stream as-it-airs content, for example, because iPlayer deliberately delays the rebroadcast of topical content, whereas light entertainment is immediately made available.  Case in point being, whenever an episode of The Girl Whose Nipples Speak German is aired on BBC Three, it is immediately available on iPlayer.  But Newsnight and Question Time aren't made available until, sometimes, 24 hours later. 

Murdoch knows, from the model adopted by Dish in the US, that people will pay for content À la carte, on the belief that it offers more choice.  In reality, it segregates and segments the market even more than it already is.  Genre based Electronic Programme Guides are the future of TV.  But this is anathema to the idea of paying a flat fee.  

What happens next is down to whether or not the British public are prepared to see the BBC go to a voluntary funding model, similar to PBS in the States, through a switch to a lower cost replacement for the licence fee, with the option to top-up the subscription package for premium content.  What's worrying, isn't if this will happen, it's when.  Because if Murdoch gets his timing right (and when has he ever not?) this could potentially destroy the BBC altogether — because Murdoch ultimately holds the rights to more premium content than the BBC can afford to compete against.

I would argue, rather than trying to out-do Murdoch on broad interest programming, they should focus on their core strengths and focus on science, factual and drama.  But I rather suspect the BBC Trust have an agenda driven more by the profits of BBC World, the commercial wing of the BBC, than they do the continuation of University Challenge and Only Connect.",0,1327264365,null,0,false,0,c3jj0q9,t3_orr3l,t1_c3jj0q9,t3_orr3l,null,1428220531,9,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,9

true,ctesibius,cnty-uk,"Reading, Berkshire","I suspect this is supposed to be the equivalent of the 9pm watershed on radio and TV - a very basic filter to try to make the Internet somewhat child-safe, never intended to be water-tight. If so, there are two considerations which we should be careful not to confuse: should we stop children of some age from seeing some content; and is this an effective way of doing it with minimal interference on other users.

My own answer to the first is yes - there is a lot of content (not necessarily sexual) which a five or ten-year old should not be exposed to by chance. I don't mean that they should not see it: I remember seeing real people being killed in the Biafran War while watching the news with my parents when I was seven. But that was very different from coming across a NSFL image while idly browsing alone. Obviously, there is a huge amount of room for argument over who should be able to see what, but I think that most people will agree with the some points: a five year old should not be able to see sado-masochistic bestiality; and a fifty-year old should be able to see young ladies without their under-crackers. Anything beyond that is very much up for debate!

What about the second consideration? My experience is with my mobile provider, who have a content bar in place. I had to establish that I was eighteen or older to have it lifted. There were several ways of doing this, including wandering in to one of their shops. Not difficult, but I would have preferred that the default was off for postpay users (normally over 18 because of the contract) unless the account-holder asked for it to be set on.

Personally, I think that this is the wrong approach to censorship. Select in, not out. Use the same approach as for DNS-based blacklisting of spam sites, but reversed. So set up a DNS TLD "".kids5"", and couple that with filters which at the ""five year old"" setting white-list any site registered under this TLD. Similarly with "".kids10"" and so on. The main points about this approach:

* You don't need to use a URL ending in "".kids5"" - you can have this as an alias (technically you would use a CNAME record in DNS). This way no-one has to change bookmarks.

* Because it depends on opting in to an age classification rather than opting out, it will be less vulnerable to spam (easy to de-register if it happens), and in any case most porn or NSFL providers would not want to register.

* It's something which could be enforced by client-side software very easily. So leave the decision to parents as to whether to install it, and have different privileges on different accounts on a PC, rather than blocking a whole ISP connection.

* It is necessarily a broad-brush approach like the 9pm watershed. I don't see that as being a big problem: if that approach is good enough for TV, why try to lock things down more tightly on the Internet?

I have wandered the world for much of my life. I grew up with some of the wonder and excitement, and in part because of how bored I was when my family settled down I went looking for adventure when I was able to. I loved it, and I loved being able to do it.

But it had to end. I needed to deal with my life for a while (mostly to go to school). But recently, in my attempts at catching up on all the things I missed, I watched the Doctor Who reboot. It honestly made me miss all those things, and makes school a little hard to sit through knowing full well where I've been and where all I could go. I figure that somehow I will turn my experience in school into a way to go do better things later, and go back to exploring when I'm done.

I have a theory that a lot of people who grew up after the space program started have been raised with this idea that there is more to life than just what is around us. That we've been raised with this drive to find new things, and explore - which is awesome. But it does make life hard to sit through sometimes.

Seriously read the Stasi files on east germans, even after they'd been nazis and lost to a psychotic Stalin they STILL had trouble seeing the injustice they were being subjected too and understanding that the state didn't have their personal best interests at heart, even as everything they could see was being broken up and sent back to russia, even as the trains were pulling up the rail roads behind them - many or maybe even most of them still thought that the government was looking out for them and these hardships were simply part of life.  
  
Every little drip that isn't fascism which you ignore is filling that bath that'll drown the baby, every little reaction to events which is 'forced upon the government' and every little 'good idea not properly reasoned' or 'bad idea that isn't really causing any trouble' is silently filling the room with gas until you fall asleep and never wake up.  
  
As has been said, you can't afford to be neutral on a moving train - when you look away from oppression you're siding with the oppressors, when you keep quiet about unfairness you're siding with the cruel.  No this single bill isn't a night of long knives, it's not a train ride to a work camp but it certainly is yet another step towards our internet, and thus our voice; being silence, being controlled by the government, being dictated to and being unable to complain.

This is [DEVE's homepage](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/DEVE/home.html), which to be honest isn't very enlightening. I think they may be one of the bodies that reviews and comments on bi-lateral and multi-lateral trade agreements. So ACTA falls into their realm. I think there are several committees on the EU that review ACTA. I'm not sure if if the committees on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has been asked to comment. I would imagine they would be more on our side.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor.

With that being said, it also has the stories that all the writers and producers of the new series grew up watching.

We are currently still rebuilding the team, and it shows. We've replaced Konchesky and made-of-glass with what is the best left fullback we've seen in quite a while. We're re-shaping the central defence to Agger and Skrtel instead of Carra and Agger/Agger's replacement during the three-to-five-month month injury period we all knew would appear at some point during a season.

We're missing what eventually went from being a useless twat to becoming a key piece in central midfield in the form of Lucas. We're missing a Class A striker due to losing a game of Race Card against Patrice Evra and the FA.

For the first time in ages, we are being supplied with decent crosses from the wings. We're not getting the kind of service that makes a man squeel with delight like a little girl, but at least we have something that actually does resemble wingers, and not what we've been having for the last ages in the form of a series of more or less useless players, who eventually gets replaced by a retrained Dutch 10,000 meter runner. 

And we have an angry, stubby little Welshman with poor knees to sub in as a striker ever so often. As long as we do not overuse him and provide regular maintenance, he seems to have some will and some pace about him, and can actually score a goal or two.

So we do have a a flop of a striker. Are you surprised? If you haven't been paying attention for the last two decades, let me explain something to you: If you are brought in as a Liverpool striker, you get struck with the Liverpool curse. It works in one of two ways; either you turn to shit right away despite having been a promising player with heaps of talent, or you keep performing well but you are ruined for everybody else and will never play as well ever again if you are sold from Liverpool. This has been more or less the rule of things ever since Ian Rush went to Juventus, but the difference is that in the past we used to have at least six strikers or so at hand, utilizing the dual order between ""Is shit now"" and ""Will be shit if he ever leaves"" in order to have at least two or three functional strikers to lean on.

We did spend too much yank money this summer, and we got too little return on too heavy investments. But we still have a rock solid foundation we can build a decent team on. We should just realize that we require a lot of strikers in order to find one or two who works. So we should cut some dead weight, and instead of splashing out £30M on one single striker again, we should rather get six £5M strikers or at worst three £10M strikers instead.",0,1327313589,null,0,false,0,c3jqcho,t3_osop5,t1_c3jqcho,t3_osop5,null,1428224052,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

It suggests that if the wording was changed so that it would be binding or that any future changes were transparent then they'd be happy to apply it.

&gt; The regulator didn't revoke the channel's broadcasting license at the time. But in the course of investigating the complaint, Ofcom realized editorial control of Press TV rested with the broadcaster's headquarters in Tehran, rather than with the its operations in London. That posed a problem because it was Press TV's London office that held the channel's U.K. broadcasting license. British regulations require the entity ""in general control of the TV service"" to hold such licenses.

Making your own takes a long time, and if you're poor you're probably also more prone to moving around every year or two as your slum residence degrades from good-enough-to-rent to uninhabitable. 

Gardening also takes tools - a garden fork can cost as much as enough food for a week, and if you're poor enough that buying veg is an issue, then saving up money just isn't going to happen. Seeds also seem very expensive if you're a beginner - 99p for a *chance* of future carrots in several months doesn't compare to £1 for a large bag of quality-assured fresh carrots right now.

If you *already* grow veg, then yes, you have a good buffer against future penury, but trying to start from scratch, even if you're as keen a gardener as I am, it's too difficult and expensive to really get started without a lot of help from outside.

As I am sure that you know SOPA, and PIPA that are currently being debated in the United States would effectively close down the free internet entirely, using the excuse of protecting Copyright. Nikki Sinclaire MEP does not support the American Government  making this more and more questionable move and is completely against any similar legislation in Europe.

The EU soon will be debating the ACTA Treaty which like the SOPA and PIPA threatens the exchange of knowledge and information on the Internet; in any and all circles where the information could be deemed to be someone else's 'property'. We believe itself should not exist in any form. It is a catastrophic violation of individual private property, and so we will oppose ACTA when the final bill comes up for vote in the European Parliament. These proposals only adds to the growing already very BIG list of reasons why'd we'd be better off out the EU !!
 
No-one would disagree with the need to oppose and control infringement of IP/Copyright, but ACTA is not the way to go about this.  ACTA like SOPA and PIPA criminalises the general population and strangles innovation and freedom of speech and expression.

The whole episode would use all the typical Bond villain tropes, building audience expectation that Stormageddon is some diabolical mastermind. The Doctor would burst into his lair with a cheesy, over-the-top shout of, ""Not so fast, Stormageddon!"" He would deliver the stereotypical evil monologue, detailing his supposed plans for wold domination, ending with words to the effect of ""...and no one could stop me. Nothing could stand in my way, could it?""

At which point the Doctor would assume a defiant stance, the music would swell to a dramatic crescendo, and after a silent beat the Doctor would reply simply, ""No, you're right, I don't see any way this plan of yours could possibly be defeated. Well done, Alfie!""

There would be some brief banter with Stormy offering thinly disguised prompts to urge the Doctor to defeat him, with the Doctor casually batting each one aside with a technobabble reason why that course of action would have zero chance of stopping the plan. As this happens, the Doctor would find a comfy seat, recline, and close his eyes as if napping. Stormy would look incredulously from the Doctor to the countdown timer on the doomsday whatever, and at the last second, desperately slam his palm on a cancel button, as the Doctor smiles and opens one eye.

Then the true scheme and its purpose are detailed, with a few moments of ""How did you know?"" from Stormy, and a few detective-mode flashbacks from the Doctor. Stormy thinks all his planning was a complete failure, but the Doctor reassures him, ""Oh, no, it's a good plan. I like it. A lot. I just wanted you to know one thing: I'm proud of you, Stormageddon, Dark Lord of All. Now, shall we take it from 'not so fast Stormageddon?'"" They reset the scene for Stormy's defeat, go through their stage-managed roles, and the Doctor is the hero once again.

In the aftermath, as the Doctor and his companion(s) are leaving, the Doctor explains the historical impact of Alfie's actions, and the benefit felt for generations to come. ""But in order for all that to happen, someone had to bring everything to a head. Someone had to play the villain. Stormageddon will be remembered by humanity as a terrible and evil monster. But you and I will remember Alfie Owens for what he was: A hero. A braver hero than I'll ever be, too. The people I help usually know I'm on their side, eventually. Alfie was prepared to be known by everyone as a cruel and sadistic villain, all for the sake of saving those same people who would hate him. He deserved a congratulations from *someone*.""

From a recent thread concerning how jurors deal with rape cases: [Grigori7 gives some statistics demonstrating how 'bad' people can be at dealing with the salient facts and ignoring their own biases.](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/oaorx/earl_of_mansfields_son_raped_16yearold_after/c3fqopj)

But in terms of common sense: Suppose someone is up before the court charged with whatever. A juror goes on Facebook or whatever and finds the defendant has made loads of YouTube videos making fun of people who like ballroom dancing. Juror is a ballroom dancer and is annoyed by the misrepresentation and ignorance shown by the defendant. Whether the juror intended it or not, he/she has likely been prejudiced by what he/she's seen. Perhaps not as much as others could be, or very much at all. But the point stands: The juror is unlikely to view the defendant as neutrally as they should have.

People find it very hard to separate or distance themselves from thier emotions when it comes to certain issues. Consider your own past when you've heard about something, a news issue for example or that someone had done something. Then a little while later you hear something to the contrary. Which to do you 'believe'? I can guarantee that in a large number of cases you've said about the new information ""Hang on, no... X can't be right because I heard it was Y.""

That is, in a way, a good thing. We're generally skeptical by nature (depending on how old we are) because otherwise we'd find ourselves in all sorts of trouble: ""Hey! Jump off this cliff - everyone who does it here can fly!""    
""Erm... wait now... that doesn't make sense.""

An extreme example, but it should make the point. A juror taken his or her own initiative and finding irrelevant information about a defendant has the potential to skew their views unfairly.",0,1327332132,null,0,false,0,c3jrzk1,t3_ossrr,t1_c3jrzk1,t1_c3jrtlv,null,1428224831,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

As somebody who **is** on it, I can tell you, without the drama, that it is indeed not as bad as BT.

On the cheapest packages: 

&gt; Customers with Broadband size: XL / L / M – during peak times, we moderate the speeds of the very small proportion of customers who are downloading and/or uploading an unusually high amount. Where we improve upload speeds, we'll also be adjusting our traffic management in the upgraded areas so everyone can get a fair share.

On the more expensive packages:

&gt;**Customers with Broadband size: XXL (50Mb)** – your downstream usage excluding file sharing traffic (see below) remains unaffected and we'll soon be increasing your upload speeds from 1.5Mb to 5Mb. However during peak times we'll need to slow you back to 1.75Mb if your upload usage is particularly high.

&gt;**Customers with Broadband size: 100 (100Mb)** – your usage excluding file sharing traffic (see below) is unaffected.

This is compared to BT, who offers you a 40mb limit on the cheaper speeds, and £5 per extra GB you download over your limit. And you're right, the higher download speeds have unlimited usage. My problem with that lies in the higher speeds being quite a bit more expensive than Virgin's.

&gt; This is why America was trying to pass SOPA, they are unable to take down foreign websites so blocking them in the US is the next best thing.

Except America runs the global DNS system, through ICANN.

The issue is that to prevent privacy would require absolutely draconian action. What happens if I set up MegaUpload 2 in any country without strong anti-piracy laws, but provide a service to the whole internet? Piracy will move to a different location, and then more draconian laws will be enacted. Which will be similarly ineffective. The only long-term solution if you go down that route is filtering all incoming traffic for infringing material, which will be a massive violation of privacy.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"This is likely my favorite Liverpool-related blog. The articles are detailed and generally well-thought-out. A couple things I took away from this article:

**1.**

I thought the 50% success rate idea was something important to keep in mind. It personally gave me a lot of perspective.

In past year or so of transfers we see (in the order the author used):

* Torres, Meireles, Aquilani and Babel v. Carroll, Henderson, Adam, and Downing
* Ngog, Jovanovic, Insua, and Poulsen v. Suarez, Bellamy, Coates, and Enrique

To me, I really only wish that Meireles had stayed on our squad.


**2.**
&gt;With the 2011 net spend around £35m, but with the wage bill slashed due to lack of Champions League income, it could be said that Liverpool haven’t really moved on (or regressed) that much; reshaping the squad, without getting into debt.

This part of the column jumped out at me too: **but with the wage bill slashed due to lack of *Champions League* income**

We haven't really ""moved on (or regressed) that much"" but it's obvious that we have to qualify for the Champions League as soon as possible to be able to continue improving our squad beyond what we have now.
