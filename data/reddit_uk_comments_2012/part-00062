Brilliant comment. I don't really have an answer to that one but I do have a few straws to clutch... 

All I can think of is that he did start off on a fairly good note with 5 undefeated matches undefeated (4W 1D) before the run broke (unfairly) against Man Utd., and then went on to string another 6 undefeated matches (5W* 1D) before that ill-fated QPR match. 

Yet, despite all those wins, everyone who watched the season could see that the team wasn't entirely happy. The high-line was proving troublesome, the lack of clean-sheets was being questioned, the narrow margins of the last-minute wins were becoming worrisome, sulking faces were being seen more often than not in the dugout. His first 'proper' loss for me was losing 3-5 to Arsenal, which IMO, was the last straw on the camel's back.

It also bothers me that the verdict on him being a bad man-manager isn't unanimous within the team. Those bitter with his decisions are almost venomous, while those who see him in a positive light have also bestowed a lot of praise. There are the neutrals who have diplomatically distanced themselves and said nothing yet. And then, there's AVB himself.

&gt;I like the Raspberry Pi but surely it is easier to teach programming on a normal computer? Which schools already have many of? Sure - programming is more difficult in a Windows environment sometimes but hell there is nothing from stopping them using Linux as there are quite a few easy distributions now.

So we reimage an IT suite with Linux, fine. Maybe we can get it joined to the domain. The IT Manager will already be throwing a fit because it doesn't work with the existing Windows user profiles and group policies. Then you have the problem of Lesson 2 coming round and an English class coming in with a teacher who expects the same Windows and Office setup used in the rest of the building.

&gt; it irritates me when the schools waste so much money on Microsoft licenses

Licencing has been a massive expense for us over the years. Yet we don't get any support now for software we've spent thousands on because it's coming up to 8 years old now.

To give Microsoft their due, [this new licencing deal](http://www.microsoft.com/uk/education/schools/software-licensing/types-of-educational-licence/enrolment-for-education-solutions.aspx) for schools will save a lot of money.

The trouble is the Headteacher and finance staff signing off on software licencing might not know what an SQL server is but they do know the terms ""Microsoft"" and ""telephone support"". They do not know or understand terms like ""open source"" or the idea that you might get technical support from an Internet forum.

You'd assume that with some wide men coming in, Sturridge would move towards the centre, question marks remain over his ability and teamwork though

Fergie had that line about going in to a season with 4 strikers who could be relied upon, well it seems as of now we only have Torres, Sturridge and Lukaku, none of whom I would call reliable. If the club is going to persevere with Nando then another big name striker could be accommodated, the two of them splitting game time still amounts to 30-35 full games each. Studge wouldn't like this, of course, as he'd be forced to continue out wide

I think bringing in Falcao or Cavani would be a coup for us, and would also be a priority over keeping Sturridge happy. We need team players as you can't have players like Mata racking up 55 games again next season, this means some time spent on the bench or in the stands. I think Sturridge would be one of the first to react badly to any such talk too. Then again, Lukaku could go on loan and Danny could be a solid 3rd choice striker.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"Most people I talk to have wildly different opinions on Higuain, which I think is a very dangerous sign. Some Madridistas think he should be the first name on the team sheet (after permanent fixtures Ronaldo and Casillas) while others think he's a waste of space who is rightly far behind Benzema. I don't come across many people who think Falcao or Cavani are anything less than top class. Also, as Real create so many chances, Higuain rarely has to do 'the dirty work' himself, while Falcao and Cavani are seen dropping back a la Didier and winning the ball. I prefer that kind of all round contribution, Cavani in particular excels here

I think Torres would be fine with a big name coming in, as long as he still plays. City have the best striking situation and they keep Balotelli, Dzeko, Tevez and Aguero happy, all £30m strikers. United still called upon Berbatov, now 4th choice there, a fair few times this season even with 3 young men in Welbeck, Rooney and Hernandez

I don't think Torres is finished, I honestly think he can come good, but I don't want to go in to next season with all hopes on him, and all the pressure on his shoulders. Having a few players helps us adapt to a changing situation and cope with midweek fixtures (more next season due to Club World Cup at Christmas). Whoever comes or goes, we need 3 or 4 players who can do the job. You can always use 2 men in one game, say Torres bangs a couple in a game, give Lukaku the last 20-30 minutes and let him have a shot against smaller teams.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'm not an anarcho-capitalist by the way, but I do think anarchy defined as without wilful coercion at the macro level should be the goal. I want the most wealth for the most beings for the most time, so that means this generation cannot fuck things up for the next and just like 'nature' one generation needs to leave the real/political/abstract environment more fertile than the next. If this wasn't the case we'd still be proto-organisms drifting around on bed rock, or we'd be headed back in that direction.

The most significant for me is agriculture and the current design of money. Both destroy wealth over time, whilst centralising power, resources and especially land. A statement about modern agriculture (from the latin *agro* meaning field), is an obvious destroyer of wealth. Since the invention some thousands of years ago average soil depth has fallen significantly, and there is evidence coming out that suggests the fertile crescent around Iraq where agriculture was born was wrecked by ploughing and over grazing.

If true what does that mean? A society becomes predatory using up all resources particularly the soil and moves on, which sets up a race between communities to see who can mine the wealth fastest. We can contrast this with the forest (an anarchistic system) which builds soil over time always leaving more wealth for the next generation: more soil, more plants, more animals, more wonderful complexity, till man came along with his artificial intelligence and reversed that trend. We also find the most predatory of inter-human relationships surrounding land.

So what of money? Just as land is an increasingly scare resource, so is money, or should I say the design of 'our' money. It comes from central planners and quite arbitrary rules govern how much should exist at any given time. The system also demands more from every generation than the last because money creation comes with a precondition: you get money if you give more of it back. At the macro level that means someone goes bankrupt or collectively society goes into more debt to service the previous debt, which goes into more debt to service the... and 2008 happens. The government arbitrarily prints money and things chug along for a bit, then the Euro collapses and we go to war with China over the relatively untapped wealth of Africa. The system firstly is wildly open to abuse because it is a centralised power (dominated currently by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, both private entities), but the people are incentivised to be competitive over a deliberately scare resource and of course money is anonymous. You have no idea if the 10£ in your wallet came from a legitimate (I don't mean non-legal tender) or ethical source. It could be diamond blood money, it could be David Cameron's, or the spoils of war. Likewise, money that you have earned into existence can be used by someone you find distasteful, or to pay for the war. Money therefore forces you to trade with people who you wouldn't normally. Boycots only really happen one way, and I can't refuse an entity use of my money via a third party. Also you can't avoid taxes, making anyone contributing to also an accessory to murder!

I see society as an emergent system mostly dictated by the tools we have at hand. The most ubiquitous is the use of money, and it is one we never got right. The same can be said of our voting system. 'Direct democracy' or consensus works on the small scale, probably up to 100 people, but it quickly fails, so we go paper which forces representation and in a world where there is a central will governing money there is one that get to pick the monarchy. We can break that culture by shrinking the social bubbles, but that could lead to tribal fighting for example if it was even possible. The alternative would be to expand the sense of identity (which the internet seems to have done), then get rid of the reps national boundaries and have overlapping bubbles of socio-economic centres. 

I've been brief but there is plenty of things to say, the obvious counter would be what about crime and immigration. To that I just say they are both a symptom of inequality; address the money system that allows profits to be centralised or a priority over ethics, reform land stewardship (opposed to ownership), and any thing else that de-stratifies society.",0,1337898772,null,0,false,0,c4s0edo,t3_u1msp,t1_c4s0edo,t1_c4rva9j,null,1428994288,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,McCackle,eng-sussex,West Sussex,"I think you have unrealistic expectations. Any public meeting in which there are strong views ends up with people behaving as they do in the House of Commons (booing, heckling, jeering, cheering) it's just that over the years it's developed into the particular behaviours we see during PMQs. It's odd because although it looks chaotic and undignified it's actually quite formalised and strikes a highly effective balance between passionate argument, immediate reaction and reasoned debate. And remember this is only during moments of high tension, if you watch BBC Parliament throughout the day you'll see debates conducted in an exemplary way day in day out. You're complaining about 30 minutes of theatre in a week of business, and as I say even that half an hour of seemingly abandoned childishness is highly evolved in terms of parliamentary procedure. Before you get too sniffy about it all, take a look at the European Parliament where behaviour is dignified and courteous but debate is essentially meaningless or non-existent and serves only to rubber stamp decisions made in a backroom meeting somewhere. The UK parliament is loud and messy, yes, but that doesn't mean it would be more effective if everyone behaved like they were at a tea party.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Thats because they're spending their money on shit.

Someone with a disabled child (and I know this because I have one) gets extra money. And a lot of it.

For a start, there is DLA. The top rate for mobility and care is worth £7540 a year. And then there are TWO payments through child tax credits of £2950 for a disabled child and another £1,190 if they're on the top rate. So in DLA and CTC alone, the parents of a child on the top rate of DLA are getting £11680. And they get another £1000 child benefit. So for that one child, the state gives them £12,680 which is more than many people earn in a year.

If one parent isn't working, they can also claim carers allowance which is £55.55 a week or another £2888. So now we are at £15,568. 

They also automatically qualify for a Warmfront grant to get heating installed and insulation done in the house for free. 

AND then on top of that there are any unemployment benefits or wages, working tax credits, child tax credit and child benefit for any other children etc that they may get.

ALSO there are many one off payments that are available. For example, one charity will give you £500 a year to spend on leisure activities or toys etc for your disabled child.

So in light of the above, I'd like to know just why parents of disabled children needed to take out a loan to buy basics last year.

I do in fact know the answer to this as I know personally someone who has two children with Duchens MD. She gets over £40,000 a year in benefits, has use of a free adapted car and still runs out of money 3 to 4 days before her next fortnightly benefit payment because somehow it costs her in excess of £800 a week to run a house for a family of four even though she has a rent free house with no council tax to pay. She, like them, pisses away her money on pointless shit and is up to her neck in debt because she has spent her money on pointless shit in the past. I can't even work out what the fuck she spends her money on because she has nothing to show for it, not even a well decorated and furnished home. And it sure as hell is not spent on the kids. The only time they go out is when we take them out or she fobs them off to respite care. Even the PS3 and Xbox 360 they have was given to her by a local charity run by a local radio station after she gave them the sob story. I'm sure she must take £250 out of the cash machine twice a week and set fire to it.

My brother works for the local council. His job is to go out and advise people on debt. He says it is common to go to the house of someone who is facing prison for failure to pay council tax who says they can't afford it because they have no money and have other debts whilst between them and their partner they smoke £100 a week in cigarettes. There are a lot of people with a lot of really fucked up ideas about the order in which you spend your money on things.",0,1337898871,null,0,1337900089,0,c4s0f51,t3_u2hlo,t1_c4s0f51,t3_u2hlo,null,1428994298,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,lopsiness,lfc12,,"Because he's arrogant, an asshat, has questionable taste in modifying the Liverbird on his trainers, but mostly because he's all these things without winning any championships in the NBA. His move to Miami culminated in an hour long special on ESPN called ""The Move"" or something like that in which he announced his decision to leave the Cavs and join the Heat. It was overblown and really a testament to how ridiculously hyped he his since he hasn't won anything. 

He's also seen as kind of cowardly, with a penchant for caving in the fourth quarter during big playoff games. His move to Miami seemed more of a scheme to win a championship by piggybacking on the success of Dwayne Wade, who is an all star player with a championship already. 

The stars of the previous generation of players (Bird, Jordan, Magic) set a standard by always competing with each other by leading championship tier teams on their own, so for LeBron to team up with someone kind of makes him out to be too afraid to make a run on his own and he has to use Wade as a crutch to win. 

In his defense, his previous team (Cavaliers) really didn't do much to make the team good enough beyond a first round playoff spot, but the whole thing together with his inability to win so far in Miami leaves quite an unsavory taste in the mouth of many fans, regardless of allegiance.

And that is why I don't want him associated with Liverpool. ",0,1337900164,null,0,false,0,c4s0or3,t3_u074u,t1_c4s0or3,t1_c4rfije,null,1428994433,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Yes, we ALL want the best for our kids. But sometimes, financial circumstances dictate that we cannot buy every luxury item. So we DO WITHOUT. That's the way it's always been. But no, these people don't want to do without ... they take out payday loans they can never possibly pay back and KNOW all the risks, yet they do it anyway. Then when they are up to their eyes in debt, it's somehow the governments (taxpayers) fault for not giving them enough money ?

My final statement was about entitlement, and about if you wanted something badly enough you had to work for it. 40 years on, that sentiment seems to have been lost. The government (taxpayer) MUST GIVE THEM EVERYTHING, and because little johnny is disabled, they can make a sob story to the newspapers and tug at the heartstrings.

What I really don't like is when people *whine* about the ones they don't like, spewing a torrent of complaints about how *their* Doctor was the *best* and this one is *awful* because he's so *different* and *why* couldn't they have kept *their* Doctor longer?

Because Doctor Who is a show about change. Each adventure takes place in a different place and time. Companions come and go. The Doctor changing his appearance and parts of his personality is one of the hallmarks of the show, one of the things that makes Doctor Who special.

Liking one above all others or even very much disliking one is perfectly understandable, and does not prevent anyone from being a ""true whovian"". But ruining it for everyone with your loud insistence that ""FNARG THAT DOCTOR SUCKS BLARGHL"" is most certainly not. That does not make a true whovian.

Having personal experience in campaigning, I've come to realise this; Politics in the UK is a game of accumulating influence, and having the confidence to walk into a campaign office repeatedly and volunteering to help will get you much further than money ever will. 

Climbing all the way from being a lowly campaigner to the Cabinet is exactly the same process, volunteering with elections, standing for seats (even if you know you won't win), talking with people, and getting your name heard.

You get the ""political classes"" because families within that ""class"" typically tell their offspring to help out a political party as soon as they're old enough. As a secondary effect, they're more likely to take Politics courses. When they bear children, the cycle is repeated.

Too many people will just fall for the ""all politicians are losers"" mantra and the associated misconceptions exemplified by the OP and would feel repulsed by the idea of talking and helping people who are politicians. This precise attitude eliminates their chances of making a real difference.

Alright, well let's have a looksie.

&gt;Right... like Transfer Fees &amp; weekly wages

Yessir, which accounts a lot of Chelsea expenditure but not all of it, so for example investment in the youth set up, stadium expenses, depreciation of non-player assets and a whole heap of other stuff is not included, so our operating losses aren't running as highly as suggested by the official total. Especially when you take into account that transfer expenditure isn't deducted immediately but amortised over the length of the contract. So for example Torres' £50m 5 year contract only costs us £30m over one of the three year windows. In addition depreciation of any assets acquired prior to the implementation of the rules (ie the transfer fee deductions of any players we signed before now) aren't counted toward the ""expenses"", which saves 10's of millions off our current expenditure already.

&gt;Do you have a source for that claim?

[Here you go chief](http://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Tech/uefaorg/General/01/50/09/12/1500912_DOWNLOAD.pdf). Article 60, paragraph 7 says that in the event of a break even deficit a club may rely on showing that their deficit has decreased from the previous reporting period. Annex XI mentions this as well.

In addition even if we completely collapsed and fell afoul of the rules the worst they'd ever do is slap us with a fine. Bottom line is UEFA need the big clubs in their competition for commercial reasons, so they'll never actually go any further if they can help it.

There's many more reasons why these rules won't trouble the big clubs from clever accounting to outside business dealings like City have done with their stadium naming rights. Suffice it to say, the only people who should be worried are the smaller, poorer clubs.",0,1337912302,null,0,false,0,c4s2zg1,t3_u221c,t1_c4s2zg1,t1_c4s2gad,null,1428995505,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

true,TabascoQuesadilla,mcgann,McGann,"Start with the 2005 Series 1 (Christopher Eccleston).

However, the first half of Series 1 does a pretty good job of putting new viewers off in my experience.  I have one friend who will never forgive me for ""forcing him to sit through that pile of shit"" (referring to 1x01 ""Rose""), and refuses to watch any other episodes.

So the alternative is to start with Series 5.  It's a good ""fresh start,"" since it's a new Doctor, new companions, and a new production team, so it's almost like a new pilot (production slates for S5 actually said ""Series 1"").  Then, when you get caught up, pop back to Series 1's ""Rose"" and watch the rest.

I'd *recommend* starting with Series 1, but if you think it's too childish and hokey then try Series 5 instead.  But Series 1 gets pretty fucking awesome about halfway through, so I'd try to power through if you can.

At any rate, MAKE SURE you follow this order:

1. Series 1 (2005)
2. Series 2 (2006) (first episode should be ""The Christmas Invasion,"" the 2005 Christmas special)
3. Series 3 (2007) (first episode should be ""The Runaway Bride,"" the 2006 Christmas special)
4. Series 4 (2008) (first episode should be ""Voyage of the Damned,"" the 2007 Christmas special)
5. **The Next Doctor (2008 Christmas Special)**
6. **Planet of the Dead (2009 Easter Special)**
7. **The Waters of Mars (2009 November Special)**
8. **The End of Time, Part One (2009 Christmas Special)**
9. **The End of Time, Part Two (2010 New Year's Special)**
10. Series 5 (2010)
11. Series 6 (2011) (first episode should be ""A Christmas Carol,"" the 2010 Christmas special)
12. The Doctor, the Widow, and the Wardrobe (2011 Christmas special; will end up being the first episode on the Series 7 DVD set, but Series 7 hasn't started yet)

So the important bit is to watch the Specials listed in **bold** between Series 4 and Series 5.  This is *very important*, as there are significant plot developments in those Specials - think of them as Season 4.5.

They're not included in the Series 4 or 5 DVD sets (there's a separate ""The Complete Specials"" set for them), and on Netflix they're categorized as separate movies and not as part of the series.

If you jump from Series 4 to 5 without seeing the Specials you'll be *super* confused.  So make sure you do that.

But if you start with Series 5, it's not a big deal at all, you don't have to watch the specials first.  Only if you're watching S1-4 first.",0,1337915901,null,0,false,0,c4s3pdy,t3_u3rs4,t1_c4s3pdy,t3_u3rs4,null,1428995917,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

Despite popular opinion being that all footballers are mercenary arseholes just looking for a large paycheck, there are players who aren't all about the money, and the fact that he's stayed at Porto without agitating for a move while being one of European football's hottest prospects for the last three years suggests he might be one of those players.

And we're not offering peanuts when it comes to salary - while our top wage earners get well below what some of the really big clubs can pay, we are still up there - there are maybe only a dozen clubs in legitimately top leagues across Europe who can beat us on salary. Hulk's likely on less than 50k/week at the moment given he's at Porto, so a wage at the top of our ceiling, while not nearly as much as other clubs could offer, would probably still be a decent raise for him.

The other teams being linked with him won't offer him the playing time we will, except maybe Liverpool (and I think we beat them on other factors at the minute). If he considers this really important (as you'd think he would) it may make a Spurs move his preference, which, as we're seeing with Vertonghen, can be very important.

To this point, he doesn't just want playing time, he reportedly wants to play in the centre. He's been largely used as an inside right forward at Porto, playing on the right of a forward three. This is what Chelsea, the apparent favourites for his signature, want him for too - to play in the role Sturridge has this year to the right of Torres. If getting to be the main man, playing down the middle, is really as important to him as has been claimed, that's another factor in our favour - we'd be offering to build our forward line around him if he joined, and nobody else in the PL is going to offer him that with the likes of Rooney, Aguero and Torres in their first XIs

Finally, all of these PL clubs that are also said to be in for him have other big targets as well - one of them is going to be spending the same money being talked about here on Hazard, and there are plenty of other big names being bandied around in connection with them. They can't sign them all, and an awful lot of the big names expected to move seem to be talking abour preferring to come to the PL this year.

It likely is a pipedream that he'll end up at Spurs, but I'm not going to dismiss it out of hand. Especially as, despite how keen I am on some of our other supposed targets, this is the only one mentioned so far that might make Modric think twice about leaving.

edit: despite all that, the Times has him already having agreed terms with Chelsea, so nevermind. Though in better news they also have QPR lining up Jenas to replace Barton.

The main reason that you may not be able to see much of a distinction from the contemporary Conservative party is because they moved their social policies to the left, after the well-known speech by Theresa May, admitting that they were seen as the 'nasty party'.

&gt;  Van Gaal, as well as Co Adriaanse, is credited with allowing the deterioration of Ajax’s academy in the mid 90s.

&gt; As a coach his approach is on the side of the collective, also applies to how he develops players, often militaristic it’s ultimately geared towards winning. “I do not think he can make Ajax a top club again,” Cruyff stressed. “He will get results short-term, but things have to change in order to improve Ajax.”

&gt; Cruyff, believes in the individual, under Van Gaal’s watch there was a shift away from the traditional approach – often referred to as the ‘Michels model’ – effectively the importance of individual training which Cruyff is an ardent supporter. The belief in this is during critical stages of a match, instead of relying on others, the player would solve the predicament himself – for example, running towards goal, he would know whether to shot or make a pass – character building is as much as important as skill development, talent is one thing but with a football brain things become more advantageous.

The grammar leaves a bit to be desired, but I think that's the thrust of the argument against van Gaal.

For me though, a more worrying issue is rumours that [van Gaal would rather be manager](http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/1077874/louis-van-gaal-tells-liverpool-he-wants-manager%27s-job?cc=3436) than move upstairs.

And about half human? It's something that is never explicitly contradicted in all of Who history. But fans have rejected this aspect of the character to every bone in their body. Most don't take it seriously. Which is hard when you think about the Eye of Harmony evidence posed. It can be explained by ""The Forgotten"" comic (which has terrible art), but I think that half human is a good piece of character development. I mean a character from a 48 year franchise doesn't get character development a lot. And at least the Doctor has the excuse of regeneration.

But yeah, he's half human. But most fans don't take that seriously. So whether you consider him half human or not is up to you. It takes a while to settle in your mind. I'm not sure if I'm totally dedicated to it. It took me a while to get used to the brother, parents, granddaughter, kids, wife, great grandson, and cousins/family.

Been supporting them for 10 years..over here most of the football lovers are Liverpool or united fans plus a few chelsea and arsenal fans...Not surprising really cos our local football scene is really bad. NO ONE watches local football matches, it's really an eyesore. Pitch condition is awful and most players aren't even professional footballers. Grant holt (Norwich) played here for a season a few years back though. Been taking a bucket load of stick from utd fans here up til this season.  Most of the Bpl matches shown here were of the traditional top 4 clubs up til bout 4 years ago. Had to settle for watching city once a month and streaming the rest online or reading every article available on the net. City jerseys werent even stocked AT ALL before the abu dhabi takeover (searched the whole of the island) but there's an increasing number of people wearing them nowadays which makes me wonder...

The main reason I got interested in city was because most of my classmates at that time were united fans and I wanted something different..but I grew to love city cos of the way the players at that time worked their socks off for the club and the super unpredictable nature of performances - city vs tottenham 4-3 fa cup, you never know what you'll get from supporting city. Plus they had an Asian playing at that time too (sun jihai)!

Remembered the time when we had bernabia and berkovic and matches were played at Maine road. Best city memory was when we beat united at coms, first derby there and winning the match. Good memories!! Man I love this club.

true,[deleted],null,null,"There are two very different situations when it comes to parking:

**WHEN DRIVERS DON'T RESPECT THE LAW**

Every single day I see cars left parked and unattended on double yellow lines. Double yellow lines! One is never permitted to park on double yellow lines. Loading, yes. Parking, no.

Often people parking in these obviously no-parking areas are blocking a narrow bridge or road making it difficult for local traffic and can often cause delays.

These people *need* to be prosecuted *far* more frequently. There just isn't enough of this kind of enforcement.

**WHEN COUNCILS MAKE IT NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO PAY**

Westminster Council in London are notorious for introducing loony payment schemes that are near impossible to obey. They have a telephone parking *only* system that requires half an hour on your mobile to an 08xx number (which doesn't use your free minutes) and frequently fails to register your debit card correctly.

That said, he WAS reliant on the old guard. The same old guard that AVB was brought in to phase out. With no Drogs, a quickly aging Lampard and Terry looking more and more unstable at times, I'm not sure if RDM is 100% the right person right now, not that I don't want him. 

Guardiola will easily get the best out of Romeu, and could spark Torres as well. He was actually quite a shrewd negotiator at Barca (though I don't know exactly how much say he had in transfers), and in terms of spotting talent that can translate into first team performances, he is bar none the best in the business in my opinion, considering how much his team dominated after he took over from Riikjard.

I mean, I get that coins dont have anything like the anti-counterfeit technology of bank notes (if you dont know about it, its a fascinating field in and of itself. Special paper weaves, UV luminous inks, swirls, holograms etc) so it makes a certain sense to counterfeit them instead of notes which would be picked up relatively quickly.

1) Size and Weight.

Metal weighs a lot. Especially £4.1m worth. I wouldnt be surprised if the value of the metal exceeds the value of the coin. Also with that weight it will take up a lot of space and be more vulnerable to discovery.

2) Speed.

I dont know if youve seen a printing press, but those motherfuckers are *fast*. To individually stamp each coin would take ages, and the tooling costs are that much higher because coins are pretty detailed.

I would have thought that you would want to do this as cheap,easily and fast as possible so that you can get your counterfeit money out into the world and then vanish immediately so you cant be found.

The heat around ""media ethics"" is only coming to a boil now. Back then the Guardian were fighting alone.

Back then they were asking who Cameron was spending Christmas with and getting stonewalled, back then they were warning him Coulson was a liability and they were laughed at, back then it was just a couple of rogue reporters phone hacking and everyone else including Brooks and Coulson were innocent and on and on.

The fact is, until the phone hacking story finally broke properly, Cameron acted with arrogant impunity, being far too close to Brooks, Coulson and the Murdochs than should have been proper, but not giving a fuck because it is easy enough to ignore the Guardian's bleatings when you have News International on your side.

And if you want fucking crazy... Mobile phones connected to the mains supply at your house need one, if they're capable of receiving a signal. Unplug it, and suddenly it's the phone's owners responsibility.

Also, if you're registered blind, you still have to pay a TV licence fee, and yes, the black and white licence is reduced.


Also, on the topic of TVL inspectors, I am actually registered with them and passed as only using my TV for consoles.

That the law has so many loopholes in it that lets people appeal against parking tickets is to my mind more a reason to tighten the legislation so that when something says ""do not park here"", then it means it.

true,Syeknom,eng-Cornwall,"Cornwall (expatriate, living in Belgium)","This has nothing to do with the Troubles, which was a complex period of tension and violence regarding the status of Northern Ireland, the unification of Ireland as an independent unity, religious conflict between Catholics and Protestants and the role of the United Kingdom in Ireland.

Instead, this incident is regarding my home of Cornwall. 

Cornwall used to be a seperate Kingdom (*Myghternedh Kernow*) independent of the various states of England. The Danes invaded and eventually united England but did not annex Cornwall. We were eventually subsumed into England during the reign of Edward the Confessor, shortly before the Norman invasion in 1066.

Furthermore, we are a celtic people and not anglo-saxon. The western celts settled in Brittany (France), Cornwall, Wales, Ireland and Scotland. There is a strong argument that the Cornish are ethnically distinct from the English as our lineage traces back to the ancient Britons and the celts as opposed to the Anglo-Saxons.

Linguistically we also differ, as the language spoken in Cornwall up until the 18th century was not English but Cornish, a Brythonic language comparable to Welsh and Breton. It is descended again from ancient British language spoken before English (a german language) became the dominant language of the isles.

As a consequence of our subsumation into England we were slowly anglicised in language, in culture, in religion and economically.

Cornwall to this day has a distinct and unique culture from England and we celebrate our celtic roots and facinating history. There is a strong sense that we are seperated from the English somewhat and we take great pride in our Cornishness. We are now one of the absolute poorest regions in the UK (we were incredibly skilled tin/clay miners and farmers/fisherman - all industries that died out horrifically and left us with nothing) but still have our history, our traditions, our beautiful beaches and countryside and our culture as sources of immense pride. The Cornish language is undergoing a revival, and bi-lingual signs are commonplace in our towns and villages.

There has been a growing political movement in the region that wishes to see Cornwall become a devolved country within the United Kingdom - on par with Wales, Northern Ireland or (for the time being) Scotland. This seperatist movement does not have a real hope of success in the near future, but it slowly gains popular support (it also, bizarrely, has a tiny militant wing!). We (the Cornish, not the seperatists) have also made gains in that the Cornish Language is officially recognised by the EU and the Cornish Pasty (a baked food) is legally protected as a Cornish foodstuff.

The article posted describes how the bi-lingual English/Cornish signs had to be removed and our flag (St. Pirran's flag) was taken down for the olympic procession. Not only that, but a torch bearer carrying the Cornish flag had it confiscated from him by the metropolitan police stating that the flag was a political symbol. Naturally, this is an affront to the Cornish pride in their region and indignation is understandable. Furthermore, the claim that displaying the flag is a ""political act"" is inflammatory as the Cornish display their flag all over the region without hestitation or political intent (indeed, our local government flies the flag as well). 

Hopefully this sheds some light for you. Cornish history truly is facinating and if you ever get the chance to visit I strongly encourage you to do so. Cornwall is one of the top tourist destinations in the UK due to its pristine nature, long stretches of dramatic beaches (including some amazing surf) and beautiful rural charm.",0,1337936785,null,0,false,0,c4s6iir,t3_u2mcg,t1_c4s6iir,t1_c4s1xzj,null,1428997237,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

true,Memoriae,eng-Cambridgeshire,Cambridgeshire,"Working in a bank as a cashier made me able to spot fake coins in a bag of 20 of them.

There was a BBC article on fake coins a while ago, about how hard it was for the ""common person"" to identify a fake, and that even the experts needed a jewellers loupe to see the fakes.  
It's utter bollocks. Even the best of the fakes are pretty fucking obvious at the worst of times.

The key things that you need to watch for are the front and bank being **perfectly** aligned. The Queen's head isn't perfectly upright on £1 coins. I've seen some where the head was bolt upright, and had to show my boss a real one to prove it was fake.  
The lettering on the side needs to be sharp, especially the cross.  
The edge should be pretty well defined, but it's not the best thing to go by, as the ridges will get worn on old coins. New ones should still be crisp.  
And the designs themselves should have **detail**. Yes, the design gets worn on old coins, but if you see something that looks anything other than evenly worn, it's a dead giveaway.

On a load of probably 50 £1 coins being dropped off at the bank by a person, I could easily guarantee that at least 2 are fake. And I'd spot them, and drop them in that nice little baggie of fake coins I had by my till.",0,1337937017,null,0,false,0,c4s6j6f,t3_u46aw,t1_c4s6j6f,t1_c4s6hys,null,1428997246,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,geekchic,null,null,"&gt; Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, branded the move “insensitive”.

&gt; He told The Jewish Chronicle: “To suggest that anti-Semitism can ever be explained, rather than condemned, is insensitive and, frankly, bizarre. AQA needs to explain how and why this question was included in an exam paper.” 

That unfortunately is the position taken on a lot of issues which leaves us in a sort of intellectual limbo land where we know prejudice exists, but lack the mechanisms to understand it and seek to eliminate unfounded prejudice.

While it remains controversial to sit down and study why people are racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic, anti-arab, communists (joke), etc - it will be impossible to develop systems to counter such ""sicknesses"".

How can you debate an issue with a person if you don't have at least some grasp of their side of the argument?

This is not a direct attack on M Gove, as he is just expressing a view that a very sizeable percentage of people share - that there are issues should not be studied, just condemned.

true,ParrotofDoom,english,Greater Manchester,"The law is very simple.  Councils use the following documents...

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/traffic-signs-manual/

...to enforce parking regulations and other road matters.  The designs are extremely simple.  For instance, there are only two designs of parking bay.  Both are described in explicit detail, with accompanying diagrams.  And yet, councils often make a hash of it, combining the two designs or inventing their own.  Then there's the traffic regulation order, which is a document that allows the council to regulate traffic in certain ways.  So in a car park, the TRO will specify what is and is not allowed, and what the council can fine motorists for.  But one of the appeals I made was that the council's ticket didn't follow the law (wrong number of days for the appeal).  The adjudicator noticed that the council had attempted to fine me for an offence that didn't exist on the TRO.  Basically, the council were making up their own laws to get the money out of my pocket, and the adjudicator ruled against them.

Then there's silly things like double yellow lines.  They are incredibly easy to design, paint and maintain, and yet councils regularly fuck them up.  It doesn't stop them trying to get money from people who park on them, and despite telling them that they've cocked up their implementation, they'll use every excuse under the sun to ignore your entirely correct appeals.  I had one council tell me that because ""they'd lose some paperwork"" they would cancel my parking ticket.  They did this rather than admit they were completely and utterly wrong, and that they were knowingly trying to take money from people who hadn't committed any offence.

Basically, when I see unlawful road signage - and if you know what to look for, you see a hell of a lot - it just demonstrates to me that councils are, for some reason, unable to follow the very simple guidance offered to them by our government.

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"Addiction can be dealt with, believe me I'm an ex cocaine addict and dry ( I don't drink any more ) ex alcohol dependent so I have quite an insight into addiction. Basically we're *all* addicted to something.

In her case though:

Step one: Stop the source of the problem in its tracks, and in this case that would be the person who's buying her all the food ( her mother ) 

Step two: Channel that addiction another way i.e. some kind of fitness regime and massively fat reduced diet which she seems willing to do ( half the battle ) 

Step three: Get her some medical support and counseling so she can face up to the real underlying issues and deal with them. You can't beat addiction on your own, it only ever works in the short term and you go right back to where you started pretty quickly ( as this girl has )  


Seems to me her mother needs some serious counseling and a kick up the arse too, she's pretty much killing her own daughter. The fact that she's not willing to help her daughter is IMO pure laziness and denial. 

To be honest I don't have any sympathy for her in the same way as I don't have any sympathy for myself and the way I pushed myself to my limits. You do have choices, it's up to you whether you want to act on them. 

My councilor has a great phrase for this condition, he calls it researching your own death and the only way you won't prematurely reach that goal is to break the cycle and remove the trigger points and supply i.e. what triggers the addiction in the first place and where it comes from.  

She's hitting rock bottom and there's only two ways you can go from there. You get help, or you die.

Traditionally an enforced holiday to give banking workers such as tellers and clerks a day off before mandatory holidays came into being. Because of the way the country worked at the time, the bank being closed pretty much meant you were too.

2) The number of members of parliament remains constant. Each is a member for a constituency. The size of the constituency changes periodically to take account of population so all MPs have roughly the same number of people in their constituency, regardless of geographical size. That means a county like mine the size of London has 1 MP whereas in London there are several. Occassionally the number of MPs will rise and fall by a few if boundary changes alone are not sufficient to level out the numbers. Usually this is done by a party for their own particular gains.

true,[deleted],null,null,"To be fair I think it could have been an excellent question but I don't think you can expect a really meaningful answer up until A-level, but then again you have to begin asking such question early and introducing them if they're ever going to be able to answer the question later on.

I'm not sure a GCSE student , when they tend to have studied more specific points of history, would have the eclectic knowledge to explain usury in Medieval ages, the reformation, the lack of recent proselytism in Judaism and/or integration, the history behind pogroms, the creation of the British mandate of Palestine, the later formation of Israel, current events and the traits of authoritarian regime to externalise the concept of a common foe and what drives people to extremism.

One or two points, sure, they'll have covered but they're not really going to develop any real understanding unless it is specifically made a topic to be studied - and that really would be OTT at this level.

It's certainly not a question that should appear in a religious studies exam however.  It belongs in the history classroom.  Asking it in Religious Studies is begging for the answer 'because they killed Jesus' which does nothing to address or explain extremism.

The actual question was 'explain briefly why some people hate Jews' which is such a soft ball it has no right even being in an exam.  If you've studied religion for two years and you can't say, 'Judaism does not recognise the prophets and central figures of the Abrahamic faiths that came after it, and it is considered by some to be responsible for their persecution', then it should be an immediate fail - but that answer achieves nothing in exploring the main historic Jewish persecutions.",0,1337950416,null,0,1337951375,0,c4s7nf1,t3_u47zn,t1_c4s7nf1,t3_u47zn,null,1428997772,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

 I understand that the New series Doctor Who is defiantly a kids show, but in choosing younger Doctors they permanently sell themselves to a junior market, and slowly loose the 20-somethings market as they get older.

Young Doctors work because they are a ""big-brother"" figure to young kids and a ""love interest"" figure to older teenagers. Middle-aged doctors are the ""fun/crazy uncle"" figure to younger kids, but do not represent a love interest or heartthrob to most &lt;20's.

An older Doctor could easily some up a Grandfather figure, or protective father figure to many generations of whovians, and resurrect a bit of nostalgia to pull in the classic fans who are starting to lose interest.

true,lokithecomplex,uk,Edinburgh,"&gt; It's ""worked"" for thousands of years. Human migration has frequently revolved around moving to find work. The reason there are so many Asians in the UK is because we gave them financial incentives to emigrate in order to help rebuild after the destruction and depopulation of WW2. At times it's essential.

Sure labour demands have drawn people and oversupply has lead to exodus and migration. Those things are not without pain. The industrial age is a more unstable age. Migrations of the past have been smaller and still characterised by clashes. Modern migrations are on a different scale and speed.

&gt; It's only in recent years that we've drawn lines on the map and restricted things. That's part of the problem, I'm sure most illegals would gladly become legal if given the option. I'm all for increaced visa allocations backed by harder clamp downs on illegals. The best way to eliminate the latter is to make being legal the preferable choice. Make it so that anyone with a clean criminal record can get a 1-2 year visa to help their families out financially. 

Here's the thing though is a political refugee more valid than a starving refugee? Why is universal political asylum for a fascist or communist good and asylum from poverty bad?

I'm not sure the country could cope with open borders. Though I can see the enormous pressure for that. The economic logic I think is short term.

Absolutely but I'm not sure we should base all economic policies on what works for highly skilled British IT workers in Dubai.

true,RedSquaree,,Belfast,"I'll just repeat what I said [in another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/tn8z4/derry_city_of_culture_city_of_fear/c4o5xed)

&gt;I'm a bit surprised by how the story has been sensationalised by the guardian. I'm fairly sure that Derry is still one of the safest cities in the UK (top 50 probably). Not exactly a city of fear. No city is crime free. Crime happens all the time and pretty much everywhere. Paramilitary policing occurs in some areas in Northern Ireland where the communities do not trust and engage with the public police. Dr. John Topping wrote a number of articles (his PhD topic I believe) on paramilitary and community policing in Northern Ireland. I'd give details but I'm on my phone atm. The guardian's article is garbage.

In a second post:

&gt;Loyalist/Unionist community organizations (LCOs) and Republican/Nationalist community organizations (RCOs):

&gt;""To digress slightly, it is a notable feature of Northern Irish society that levels of recorded crime have tended to be (and still remain) significantly lower in comparison with the rest of the United Kingdom ( NIPB 2007 b ; HMIC 2007 ; PSNI 2008 b ). Unlike the often compared transitional democracy of South Africa, which suffers from ever rising and extreme levels of violence, the people of Northern Ireland appear to have relatively little to fear (Altbeker 2005 ; Shaw and Shearing 1998 ). Though, in returning to our main point, a clear lesson has emerged from the research within both the police and the community contexts — that such sustained levels of social control and reduced crime within the post-conflict transitional space are not due to the successful implementation of any overarching (community) policing policy. Indeed, it was generally recognized through the fieldwork with the PSNI that their ability to conduct community policing (and manage crime more generally) would be significantly attenuated if it were not for the level of community-based security governance that provides both supplemental and parallel ‘ policing ’ at the local level. Indicative of the community sector attitudes across Republican and Loyalist areas, one group simply noted ‘ it [crime] would be a hell of a lot worse off I can tell you … if this place was England, it would be a tinder box … ’ (RCO). Interestingly, it was also evident from the research within the diverse community levels that, in many cases, the PSNI were also happy to ‘ sit back ’ and allow such ‘ others ’ to do their work ‘ because it was doing their [PSNI] job for them ’ (LCO).""

true,CannibalHolocaust,uk,London,"My answer to the question:

Racism or xenophobia is apparent everywhere but Europe has traditionally been the most violent region by far in world history and the only 'foreign' (or immigrant) group to exist there for any meaningful amount of time have been: [1] Jews and [2] gypsies. Naturally these groups would have been scapegoated for domestic economic/social problems and thus political parties would be formed based on this anti-foreign (in early 20th century Europe this basically means Jews) stance. You still get it today with populist, xenophobic parties being elected all the time during economic crises (Front Nationale, BNP, Freedom Party, True Finns, Golden Dawn etc). In Germany, after WWI they suffered from an extreme depression and the Nazis rose to the top in the same way Golden Dawn are in parliament in Greece. Obviously the Nazis were particularly horrific and you had WWII and the holocaust (in which Jews and 1/3 of the European gypsy population were killed).

I think if you replaced Jews/gypsies with any other group you'd have had the same thing, in fact if there were a large number of black Muslims in Europe during the early 20th century and before then I think things would have escalated much more quickly (due to them being more visibly different). We have more recently in 1995 had a genocide against Muslims in Bosnia so this sort of stuff isn't isolated.

And if you think people are going to be spending more on healthcare once NHS hospitals have the numbers of private patients they can treat limited to 10% but the profits they can draw from the private healthcare insurers at 51% you've clearly run screaming from the facts before.  It actually opens up a new revenue stream for the NHS whilst assuring universal healthcare stays cost-efficient to the tax payer.

true,ghostridethewhip,null,null,"I think Guardiola is a solid manager, but for people to be comparing him with Ferguson and Mourinho is in my opinion, questionable. He has surely been a great manager of a great side for the past few years in Barcelona. Much of the situation is circumstantial and leads me to believe that he was a fantastic manager for Barcelona, but may not be for another club like Chelsea.

He played with Barcelona for 11 years. He coached the B team for two years. He was as much of an in-house expert as Barcelona could have asked for, and I think this is one of the main reasons for his great success. Barcelona already had an excellent academy and a solid club administration that he was familiar with, a great stadium with a following unmatched anywhere else in the world, and a squad filled with world-class talent.

Yes, he got them to play beautiful and effective football, but could he do the same at a club like Chelsea where he does not know all of the players and staff, where the players may not universally love and adore him like they did in Barcelona, where he does not have a history as a 10+ year player with the club, where he does not have an intimate knowledge of the youth side and the inner workings of the club? It seems as if much of his success as a manager has been built on the foundation of one of the best clubs and talent pools in footballing history, so I question that he deserves to be in the conversation of ""best managers in the world.""

Personally, I think using A-levels to approach such ideas would be far more constructive. GCSE students are essentially taught how to pass exams. Independent thought is encouraged but isn't the main focus until you get to A-level.  


I fully agree with 87liyamu: the classroom should be the place to expand a student's sense of humanity and citizenship, not a 2-hour exam. This kind of question on a GCSE paper could force the student to cut such a complicated issue down to the bare minimum (""because they think Jews are greedy"", as opposed to ""Jews have historically been associated with financial institutions because..."").

I know some people want rid of the monarchy, and it is a nightmare to explain to many people from other countries. But it is one of the things we are most well known for; there are dozens of royal families across the world but we have *the* royal family. 

Tourism sounds like a poor argument at first but people genuinely do come from all over the world looking for a glimpse of the Queen in Buckingham palace, to see the weapons and jewels of ancient leaders in our museums or to stroll down the halls and through the courtyards that past monarchs once walked.

Now, as to the difference between Cable's public comments and Hunt's private comments that you characterise as ""bullshit"". My point, and it's a simple and straightforward one relating to Hunt's appointment rather than his eventual conduct, is as follows:

- Cable made his comments whilst in the quasi-judicial role that required him to behave with scrupulous neutrality on the question of the bid. Even talking to his constituents in such terms as he did was a breach of that responsibility, he was just unlucky they were actually journalists.
- *Before* his appointment, Hunt was well known to be favourable to BSkyB. This was not a secret, private view - he had previously made public expressions of support for Sky and James Murdoch, and I recall media reports at the time making a great deal of this fact. So the 'private' memo to Cameron is hardly the smoking gun everyone is making out - it tells us nothing we don't already know.
- The fact that Hunt had a predisposition towards Sky did not preclude him from taking on the quasi-judicial role *so long as he conducted that role scrupulously and transparently and based on the independent advice he received*. That may be distasteful to you and others, but it doesn't make the appointment inappropriate as what actually counts is *how* he subsequently conducted himself.
- So: Cameron appointing Hunt, though perhaps ill-advised, was not inappropriate and any suggestion that he did so to get Hunt to ""fix"" the decision is mere speculation.

Now, it may yet be shown that Adam Smith and/or Jeremy Hunt acted inappropriately; at the moment I get the sense that there is a lot of smoke but no fire because although the Smith/Michel communications look highly suspicious, there's no real suggestion from anyone (at least that I've heard) that it actually compromised the independent quasi-judicial decision-making process Hunt was charged with. Please note I'm not saying it definitely didn't, I'm saying that on the evidence we have so far it's not clear that it did.

I hope that explains where I'm coming from, and why I think it serves everyone best to look at what the facts actually show rather than what satisfying conclusions we can leap to. As I said above, if you can point out something I've overlooked or misunderstood, I'm more than happy to revise my opinions.

1) A common way to get more page views is to stir up a transfer battle between rival clubs

2) Jan himself seems to be putting a little bit of pressure on Ajax and Spurs to get this shit done. In another more recent interview he said he's not even thinking about Arsenal and wants to wait for Spurs and Ajax to figure something out. 

3) Translation subtleties?

true,szlafarski,lfc99,,"This would work really well. Enrique's tackling success rate would mean Agger can get forward plenty - and we all know what that means.

Reina in net, Carra or Coates, or even Kelly at RCB, Skrtel in the middle, Agget LCB, Johnson on the overlap would be DELICIOUS. Lucas and Stevie without a doubt in the middle. Carroll at the front, Suarez cutting in laterally from the right, moving more centrally as Johnson runs up the touch line - if we can get Downing firing (as he always seems to do in his second season at a club) then we might have something great happening.

Bench: Doni, Kelly, Coates, Hendo, Spearing, Adam, Bellamy

The bench, with what we have - worries me. I'd almost like to see Carra take the coaching or Assistant Management position, allowing Flanno, or even Jack, to get more game time.

I'm still on the fence about Adam - but at the same time he was one of our best players last season until Lucas blew out his knee. Plus, Martinez also likes using a 433/4231, which is what our academy teams play thanks to Rafa.

I want to see Spearing on the bench do bad - he was in our top 5 most successful passers this season and I seriously feel he improves with every game. I know people want to loan him, but he's almost at that age where a loan might kill his confidence, you know?

At the same time - Bellamy as our only attacking game changer is a HUGE gamble.

In every town of any size there is a brothel or two where two or more girls work together. In cities like London or Birmingham there are many.

How is the john supposed to distinguish the legitimate ones from those which use trafficked women? He may have no reason to suspect until he's done his business, but walking out he sees one of the women being slapped about - now he is unable to report the brothel because he would put his own liberty at risk.

Or he calls an escort to his flat, her driver drops and waits for her outside; he believes her to be Polish and has a happy experience with her, becoming a regular. After a few visits he gets to know her a little and she reveals that she's not actually Polish but from one of the small Former Soviet Republics, she's been trafficked and it's not her driver waiting outside but an abusive pimp. Likewise the john is prevented from helping the girl or reporting the situation to the police, because of the jeopardy of his own imprisonment.

Yes, this seems like an attack on johns, for whom few are likely to have sympathy (but at least they pay their bills on time). 

In reality, this is an attack on legitimate British - or at least European - working girls, because it targets their clientele.  

There is absolutely no benefit in criminalising punters who *unknowingly* frequent a woman who is trafficked, as this law *specifically* does. He should be free to report the matter to the authorities - *that* is in the best interests of the victims. 

The best situation is to have sex-work legitimised and no longer under the table, so that shady operations cannot persist. Once escorts and brothers have to be STD checked to maintain their licences, the shady operators are *far* more easily identified - the lack of a license is a huge red flag - those that can even compete in the new market. 

Your reply focuses on the trafficking law that was brought in under Jacqui Smith, but you ignore the case of Monika Campbell and Lisa Gaskin who were [praised by their sentencing judge for running a ""model operation""](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7719143/Judge-praises-women-who-ran-model-brothel.html).

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"1. We will certainly make transfers but it will be difficult to attract the top talent because we're without Champions League football. There was a recent article with Clint Dempsey (I player I wouldn't mind seeing in a Liverpool shirt) but he wants to move on from Fulham to CL competition. Unfortunately, we don't have that at the moment.

2. From what I've been reading and seeing from Wigan, it does appear that Martinez seems to be a bit more creative with tactics and formation. I hope he can place some underachievers on our team in the best position to succeed.

3. I think it depends on who we can get, I think.

4. I think all competitions will be respected, surely Europa League will prove to be an incredibly valuable experience for him and this squad. But I think the focus *must* be to secure a Champions League position. As I mentioned in point 1, we will continue to have a considerable amount of difficulty attracting/signing top talent if we don't have the Champions League.

5. At least two full seasons (if given a reasonable transfer budget). I think Dalglish deserved two full seasons as well, if not more.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"With the law that Jacqui Smith brought in, I can see why she went after sex trafficking as it is abhorrent, and is a growing problem. Unfortunately I think that in this case, she simply didn't know enough about the sex trade to fully understand how it was run, and the best way to tackle it. Like many women of her generation her views on sex, the role of the women as a victim and so forth didn't really match up to how things are, and I think this is made clear by the radio show she did about the sex trade, where she was surprised to find that some women genuinely do like working in the industry. So I don't think she did it of malice, she did it purely out of ignorance.

Now, regarding changing the law on the sex trade, we both know the reason this cannot be done in an objective, clear and focused way. The media. As the self appointed masters of the country, especially when it comes to morals, they are a significant roadblock to progressive reform of any time in this country. And the problem extends from the Guardian on the left through to the Mail on the right in the world of print, and across talk shows to things like News Night when it comes to TV. It is very clear that we need to legitimize the sex trade, ensure that it is licensed, regulated, that the workers have access to the health care, testing and security they need, and that they pay the tax required to fund this. We also need to allow communities the right to veto brothels if they would rather they not have them in their area. However, if a politician, from any party you choose, were to stand up and suggest this then the media would destroy them. So, I do not agree with your closing statement, I think its a case of a) women old enough to run for these offices have somewhat dated views on sex and the sex trade, and b) even if they wanted do do exactly what you and I agree upon as the best course of action, the media has already decided that it is not the right course of action and will end the career of anyone who attempts to pursue this. In the end it's a flaw with democracy, you have to be popular, not right, even if you know your doing stupid things.

Or how about a speed limit signs with an unlawful circular yellow border?

Short of building a huge wall we already have open borders.

There are people - university academics, I guess - who spend their entire working lives studying the phenomenon. 

Our politicians could try listening to them, but it doesn't take much to realise that that ""solution"" was totally ill-concieved.

&gt; …  Like many women of her generation her views on sex, the role of the women as a victim and so forth didn't really match up to how things are, … So I don't think she did it of malice, she did it purely out of ignorance. … I think its a case of …  women old enough to run for these offices have somewhat dated views on sex and the sex trade,

Perhaps you've hit the nail somewhat upon the head here, but that doesn't really make it alright.

The law *deliberately* penalised innocent parties, choosing the *most non-optimal* strategy for crime reporting.

&gt; It is very clear that we need to legitimize the sex trade, …  However, if a politician, from any party you choose, were to stand up and suggest this then the media would destroy them. … a flaw with democracy, you have to be popular, not right,

There's a difference between promoting the practice, putting up banners and bunting and saying it's all ok, and actively working against it and demonising it. You can just choose a path that allows consenting sex-workers to quietly ply their business, without drawing attention to it or making it more difficult for them.

true,dayus9,eng-gloucestershire,Lincs,"This is a hard one, because at some point someone's going to have to actually put a price on a human life and the life of a child when compared to an adult, or a pensioner. I'm surprised nobody has had to do so yet actually. 

How much public money is it worth to look for a missing child? How much is it worth to look for a missing pensioner with only a few years left. When should we stop spending money looking for murderers who have only killed one person? There has to be a cut-off point doesn't there? Yes this murderer has destroyed lives, but what about the other crimes those resources could used for? 

From what I can see, the amount of money and effort put into this sort of thing is directly linked to the amount of press exposure a case gets, which has to be wrong doesn't it? 

The same sort of thing comes to mind when we hear about the NHS spending a shitload of money on saving the lives of a few people with a rare disease, is it actually worth it financially? How much is a human life actually worth in monetary terms? Because when you start wasting money at the expense of others, that starts to be a problem doesn't it? 

That was a longer and more rambly post than I expected it to be.

true,marysdresswaves,tardis,TARDIS,"First of all, I recommend forgetting anything you've read about particular episodes &amp;c while you watch.  It's not really fair to yourself if you've got all these preconceived notions.  You don't want to set yourself up for disappointment; just take them as they come.  And remember, the episodes are from 2005, a brand-new reboot, and they were still trying to figure themselves out at that point.

Secondly, I discovered the show serendipitously on BBC America with Eleventh Hour when I was home sick from work one day.  So, I saw all of Matt Smith before any other Doctor.  When I finished him, I thought I ought to check out the rest of the series and watched Rose.  But I really wasn't digging it, so I skipped to Tennant and watched all that Netflix had on him.  It took me a minute at first but by the time I got to Human Nature, I was enamored.  

And just last week, I started again with Rose.  I finished Father's Day last night.  I've been pleasantly surprised with a few of the episodes and I'm glad to be watching Eccleston's take on the Doctor.  


So, yes.  I also have had trouble making it through Series 1, but I recommend enjoying the ride because it changes a lot and there WILL be something more up your alley coming.  Tennant's Doctor can get very serious at times - he does a lot of profound apologizing.  And Smith's Doctor is debatably even sillier, but the story lines are more complex.

You're going to hate Love &amp; Monsters.  :)

true,Intrinsically1,lfc50,,"To not answer your questions in any specific order (sorry) but to rather just rant, it depends on if the owners are serious about this ""new beginnings"" mentality.  If they are they will have to invest some serious money into the club (not just what we have available for signings currently) and a lot of that will have have to be for wages as well.  If we trim the fat and get rid of these substitute players who we don't use often but are costing us tens of millions in wages per year (Kuyt, Maxi, etc) as well as get rid of Joe Cole (who we are basically paying for to play at a different club) we will have some extra.  Secondly it depends on the new system we put in place.  If we get van Gaal or someone with a similar background then we will have that ""project club"" factor where players might see joining LFC as being part of something that is exciting and growing towards something big.  Whether you agree with the what you think it looks like the owners are doing so far or not, you have to admit they are looking very ambitious, much more ambitious than anyone who has been running the club in the past decade.  They didn't buy this club to let it be average and to rake in short term profits, they bought it as an investment to grow and through being successful.  Once we build up a bit of steam toward reaching that goal, even if we still don't have CL football, we will still look like an exciting club to be part of.

All we really know about what kind of transfer budget we will have is statements made by Kenny before he was let go.  What the owners were telling Kenny when he was part of the plan and what the owners are telling the new manager are likely to be two different things regarding our bankroll.  It wouldn't make sense in my opinion to make all these changes and look so ambitious without giving the new team in charge the tools and resources to follow through with the overhaul. 

I think we are likely to see Martinez as manager, who doesn't have the most prestigious resume but is tactically adept, with a team around him of extremely smart and experienced (think van Gaal, maybe Txiki Begiristain etc).  Where we are playing a football that is less formation based, more philosophy based.  I don't think that in-house, very deep interview with John Barnes was posted on the LFC website by accident.  As the Anfield Wrap said, it was almost certainly something PR related for us fans to look into, clues to the new philosophy of Liverpool FC.  If you haven't read it already, I would recommend [checking it out](http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/barnes-on-lfc-barca-future).  

If this truly is a long term project, the new manager will have to be given time and won't be held to the same standards as Kenny was his first year.  I'm sure if it is disastrous he will have to go but another finish between 6th and 8th will probably be forgiven if it looks like progress is being made.  It's just a shame that whoever he is he won't have the full support of the fans unless he is immediately wildly successful.

&gt; Can you briefly describe day to day life inside?

Depends on what you've signed yourself up for. If your not doing anything then the day is like this:

7am Optional exercise. The prison has to offer prisoners an hour out doors everyday. Not many people did this though becasue it was basiclly just standing out side in a sort of caged courtyard, in the cold, at 7am! A bit rubbish.

8am You have to be up and out of bed. They come round and check you're up by looking in the little window on your cell door. If you're not up, they wake you and you get put on report.

8:30am - 12pm Is the morning. If your not doing anything that day, this time is just in your cell. Otherwise your out of your cell doing what ever your signed up for.

12pm - 1pm is lunch time. They bring everyone whos not in their cell back to their cells for 12. Then its waiting around till they unlock your door between 12 and 1. Go down to the servers and get your food (you get a sheet every week with boxes to tick, to pick what food you want for the next week. You get 3-4 options for each meal). It was always a small baguette with what ever you chose in it, crisps and a chocolate bar. 

1pm - 5pm Is the afternoon. Same as the morning.

5pm Everyone back in thier cells. Then everyone let out to get thier dinner to take back to thier cells. Again, you get what you chose, usually pretty grim stuff.

5pm - 6pm In cell.

6pm - 8pm is association time. This is time in the rooms each wing has with pool tables, phones, and showers. This is the only time you can use these things. You don't get association time every day, and how long you get on the days you do get it depends on what level you are on in the reward system. The highest level gets the full 2 hours, the middle gets one, and the lowest gets no association time (but is let out for showers) On the weekends association time is in the morning *and* afternoon ,twice a day, if its happening at all, with nothing happening in the evening.

After that its all cell time untill the next day.

&gt; Did you get much opportunity to learn stuff in there?

Yes, there was a few classes you could sign up for, English and maths, the basic stuff. But the big thing in Aylesbury was the mechanics classes. I think Toyota (or some other car company) had some sort of deal with the prison to train prisoners in car mechanics, a lot of people did that. But mostly what people did in the morning and afternoon times was all rehabilitation courses or prison jobs (laundry, cook ect.)

&gt; Was there much of a culture of violence/aggression between inmates.

Some. But the prison officers were really strict about it and would come down *hard* on any fights. If you wanted to fight someone you'd have to really want to fight them because the officers would be on you in seconds, almost all of them. They would get you in a lock (arm lock, head lock) pin you to the ground and drag you off to segregation (British version of solitary) where you'd go up in frond of the governer (prison boss) and get punished. Usually that means time in segregation, which isn't much fun - its an empty cell with nothing but a bed, toilet and sink. So if you want to fight, you have to be willing to put up with that for a week or two. 

&gt; My concept of youth prisons is pretty vague, so any sort of general description would be interesting, ta!

Just like any other prison from what I hear. A few rules are different, like prisoners having to have single cells, unless they are trusted prisoners. But its generally the same, but I can't say much about that because I haven't been to an adult prison.

&gt; Also, grats on your new found freedom!

If you read his interviews, he is a huge proponent with the variability of the 3-4-3 and its ability to change on the fly. The key to the 3-4-3 is the extra width that the wingbacks provide, and we already have one decent left wb and a very good right wb. Our centre backs are a 3-4-3 proponent's wet dream because of how versatile they are. Skrtel can slot into the right easily, or he can play as a sweeper. Agger and Coates are both ball playing defenders who can push up as a DM, or shift over to the left at will. Carragher can still play in the centre because his lack of pace is now covered by having 2 other centrebacks protect him, allowing him to cut out incoming balls. 

While he does switch with the 4-3-3, it is built around the shape of his 3-4-3. The key on which formation he plays will be around none other than Gerrard, because he is the person least suited to a 3-4-3. The CMs in the 3-4-3 need to be very tactically disciplined, but the center is where Gerrard is the least disciplined. There is no place for a free roaming attack midfielder in a 3-4-3, but that is exactly what Gerrard is. He has to either temper his game in the centre, or go back to playing on the right. It will be interesting to see what happens with Gerrard if Martinez is really appointed as our manager. 

Other than this, we won't see much problems. The positions that we might need to reinforce are all positions that Martinez needs for his 3-4-3 anyway. We need another winger, a backup DM, a backup striker and a backup left back. If Martinez wants to build for his 3-4-3, he will get a right winger so Suarez can play cut in from the left, a leftback who is more effective going forward than Enrique, and a DM who is slightly more physical than Lucas and have the ability to move up in support of the attack. I already know more or less the players that are suitable for the roles except for the left wingback position.

If you think of a small bath room with an uncomfortable bed in it instead of a bath, a tiny window with bars on and a little tv, that is more or less what a prison cell is like. If you don't mind, or can get used to, spending most of your time in a cell then its not too bad. A lot of people can't stand it and thats what the punishment is. So I suppose it depends on your temperament.

&gt; If you were going to get £1,000,000 as a reward for reducing costs in the prison service - what would you do?

A tough question. Honestly, I don't know. Maybe fewer prison officers, I think thats mainly where the money goes, paying all their wages. But it seems like a bad idea to get rid of them, they are needed in there.",0,1337973448,null,0,1338036755,0,c4sc64b,t3_u4q4c,t1_c4sc64b,t1_c4sbikc,null,1428999968,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

A right winger will allow Suarez to cut in from the left, which is his preferred position. It will also allow us to play with 2 pure wingers, Downing on the left and the new guy on the right. 

The bench should be fine. When everyone is fit, Spearing shouldn't be on the bench, so that leaves Henderson and Adam. Personally, I feel that if Henderson can bulk up and build up his physical side of the game, he will be very suitable for a 3-4-3. The 3-4-3 is kinda unique in that it doesn't need a specialist in center midfield, like attacking midfielders or defensive midfielders. Due to his unique development from an attacking midfielder to a holding midfielder, Lucas is perfect for this role.

Pilsner - Didn't really like it. It had this sort-of sharp, sour bitterness to it that I just didn't enjoy. I'd rate it above the major commercial beers, though. 

Blueberry - Good. I would've preferred a little more blueberry flavour to it, but the comment one of your team made about not wanting to make the fruit flavours overpowering was totally valid. Maybe a little more blueberry would be cool, though.

Blackberry - Liked this. It had a lovely armoa to it, and although again the fruit flavour was understated and I would've preferred a little more, I was definitely a fan. Split between whether I liked this or the cranberry best. 

Cranberry - Possibly my favourite. I especially liked the cranberry pulp residue left in the bottom of my cup, which added a nice touch of authenticy to the drink. I had four or five of these, and could very easily drink that many pints of it. 

Cask - Big fan of this, too. I especially liked the bigger servings, but I shouldn't let that cloud my judgement. I'd definitely have a few pints of this on a summer's day.


Overall, very positive. I would like to see the fruit flavours leveled up slightly, though. Naturally, I'd be more than happy to drink lots more of your beer again, if you'd want opinions on your revised recipies.

Yes, could get deoderant on the canteen. Which is a like the prison shop. You get a big list of things like tobacco, snacks, toothpaste and that sort of thing. You get a list each week and tick off what you want and you get it next the week. You pay for it by either getting money sent in by family or friends, or you can earn a little (very little, about 20p an hour) by doing one of the prison jobs (laundry, cleaning, cooking ect.).

Yes, nearly every one smoked. Tobacco is called 'burn' and a roll up is called 'a burn'.

Not usually, but you can if you're mates with who evers serving. The food is normally grim enough that you wouldn't want more of it anyway! For instance, I had boiled beef sausages once, they were always grey and horrible, but this time I bit in to one and my teeth hit something hard. I pulled this hard thing out, it was the lenghth of the sausage. Its was a blade shaped bit of gristle which I think was the nose bone of some animal. What ever the rest of the sausage was made of was probably just as horrible, but mashed up better.

No one I knew ever had a phone. But Aylesbury is quite strict and so it would have been very difficult to get anything in that you weren't meant to have.

There was a little bit of graffiti, but not much. Got painted over all the time. And no one really vandlised anything, you don't have much and if something breaks its not getting replaced anytime soon, so people took care of things like the pool tables.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_and_anthropogenic_disasters_by_death_toll

Even in terms of genocidal events Europe loses to Russia. I stand by the idea that Europe only looks bad because of cultural bias of 'what we study in school'. It might be the case that WW2 saw the first industrial revolution to genocide and racial hatred.

&gt; About your second point, Jews were picked on because they existed.

But why does it exist to this day? Why did it get traction then? Why is the money grabbing jew a persistent idea? And I question the significance of the jewish proportion to the holocaust. I don't like numbers games, but even if we reduce it to that it is less than half the story. Estimates suggest deaths of non-jews were more significant, but we don't get questions about that.

There's always more context, the most significant seems they weren't Christian, and whether people want to talk about it or not, there is a bias towards wealth if you happen to be jewish. The richest of money lenders, those that serviced royalty, were jewish. The elevation of usury to a legitimate economic model and social relationship was afford by the jewish culture. Jews were typically outcasts and had to adopt the less acceptable jobs, perhaps debt and tax collectors (the src is a recent Chomsky video, therefore a shaky one I know). Which reminds me, why did 'they' have no homeland? What caused 'them' to be migrants in the first place to become a minority elsewhere? So yes they existed, but that doesn't explain the context or answer why 'the state' chooses to go after the same peoples? Currently we see agitation against the disabled, against those on welfare, homosexuals, and muslims. This is coming from government officials! It perhaps includes jews to a certain extent if we look to any juvenile chan or the recent arrests in Glasgow.

Maybe the better question is why do we see predatory nation states? What causes some populations to become migrants in the first place? Or why being jewish gives you access statistically to higher incomes? (The last point is a certainty if we include UK data and the US. Of course then there is the Israeli oasis amidst quite impoverished peoples.)",0,1337978635,null,0,false,0,c4sd9j2,t3_u47zn,t1_c4sd9j2,t1_c4sc9nb,null,1429000484,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"The farting aliens are a shame all fans must bear, trust me. The first season is harder to get into because, yes, it's sillier. Or at least not sillier per say, but less serious.

Doctor Who is a show known for its optimism and not doing that whole ""dark and gritty sci-fi"" kind of thing. It's got serious episodes but they're not like intense emotion 24/7. Just the fear and excitement of adventure or getting killed.

Like I don't think that Empty Child is silly. It's not super dark or gritty but it's fairly serious. Not dark though.

Series 1 has an underlying ""arc"". The entire show doesn't work towards one big plot- it's not Fringe or Heroes. It's more one-week adventures with a light arc going through each series (series 6 excluded, it has intense arc heavy).

Daleks are really cool. There's something about them that despite looking like saltshakers, has made them an instant hit since 1963. If you're having a hard time, even into series 2 (which, the new Doctor will seem sillier to you at first, but his run gets darker) then we can give you recommendations for certain episodes.

edit: Also, honestly, the 9th Doctor's run (series 1) is one you appreciate later on. After seeing the other seasons you realize how well he did. The acting. Esp considering it's 2005.

A couple of people have made a grab for the torch bearer since it began and they basically got thrown in a hedge by the guys in grey...

Agreed. That's something that's putting me off the whole thing.

It has been amusing seeing the Coke trucks on the BBC yet they can't mention the company by name :P

There's also good hints of the Rassilon/Omega/Other relationship- the legendary triumvirate (founding fathers) of Gallifrey.

Mondasian Cybermen are the real Cybermen that originated from Earth's sister planet, Mondas. The people there augmented themselves w/ tech and eventually became Cybermen. Unlike the new series series 1-4 Cybermen from the parallel universe invented by John Lumic (Cybus Industries).

Temporal grace is the idea that nobody can be harmed inside the TARDIS and no violence can occur within it because of its dimensionally transcendental nature. Which is violated on many accounts...like the 6th Doctor story Attack of the Cybermen. In the 11th Doctor story Let's Kill Hitler, the 11th said it was a clever lie. But in the Infinity Doctors novel, it actually works.

The Rassilon Omega Other Zagreus relationship is long and complicated. Rassilon is the jerk of a politician on Gallifrey who takes credit for the invention of time travel when really it was Omega who did that (and got sucked into a black whole in the process, later to be discovered in the 3rd Doctor story the Three Doctors). The Other has to do with Lungbarrow and I don't want to spoil that. Same with Zagreus and its significance. But it has a lot to do w/ Rassilon and the Doctor. And same with the Other.

Btw Rassilon invented looms and the Time Lord ability to regenerate. In fact, he invented Time Lords. Before that, there were just Gallifreyans with one life. Before Rassilon, there was Pythia, the ruler of Gallifreyan society (a matriarchal society). But then Pythia's curse made Gallifrey barren and it was nigh impossible to birth children naturally- hence Rassilon's invention of looms and regeneration.

Ermm...short is a relative term. /:d

edit: OH! Also. The TL-vampire time war was between the TLs and the vampires (beings from an alternate universe). Really this one was all Rassilon's fault- him being a jerk politician. Rassilon was determined to destroy any species that would potentially become a harm to the Time Lords in the far off distant future (like the end of the universe, has to do w/ Zagreus). So he had the bow ships (type of battle TARDIS) systematically hunt them down for thousands of years. And naturally they fought back and killed lots of TLs. The Doctor is prejudiced against vampires (see Project: Twilight, Legend of the Cybermen, Big Finish dramas).",0,1337990207,null,0,1337990417,0,c4sfgpi,t3_u55fk,t1_c4sfgpi,t1_c4sejnp,null,1429001521,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Except the Monarch appoints the Prime Minister. This is normally just a formality since there is normally little doubt about who can control a majority in the Commons, but eventually a day will come where there is a hung parliament and enough doubt over the result that no one knows who should be appointed. 

The monarch can also refuse to sign legislation. Again this hasn't happened since Queen Anne, but it's not that difficult to imagine it happening. A government has massively lost support of the public, and passes a very very unpopular law.

There's more to the beautiful game than the tikka-takka barca style. as delightful as that particular flavor of football might be, (and I happen to think it is) That's never what Chelsea Football Club is going to be, and that's not what we're about. Grinding out results in the English league sometimes demands a certain physicality and directness that the Barca style doesn't account for. 

That doesn't mean we have to play route 1 all the time, far from it. Chelsea played some absolutely sensational stuff under Mourinho, Hiddink, and Ancelotti but it was always 2 or 3 dimensional.
(this has been true even under Robbie at times; though usually against much weaker opposition; I'm thinking here of the 6-1 against QPR for instance).

It's very different. The hard part about 1963 is getting used to how *different* the Doctor is. He's an old man, self important, and a jerk. He just came from his people- xenophobic bureaucrats so he's still got their ways in. The worst part though is the slow pacing of 1963. And indeed all the way up to 1970 (colour and modernization year).

And the other agonizing challenge is the 108 missing episodes that have been reconstructed with photos and the audio of the episodes. Because the BBC threw out over 200 of them to save space...we got most of them back. But 106 are still missing (2 haven't been released to public yet though, hence 108).

There's the Doctor who is a healer, a wise man, and a good person. And then there's the great warrior, the Oncoming Storm, the Time Lord Victorious.

I agree with the whole press exposure equaling more money spent on things, I think partially because front line services and the government want to stay in the proverbial good books of the country as a whole. If there's an occasional news story about a rare disease cured because of them pumping £10 million into research for it, people in general will look upon it as a good thing. However, they use these at times when there's also postcode lotteries for basic cancer treatment and care for the vulnerable going on.

2. The Angel, which moves incredibly fast would either run across the silence again or leave the area. I would say it is more likely that the angel would cross the silence's path again as the angels are hunters; they wouldn't stop before they hit their prey. 
3. After a number of times of being quantum locked and then searching the entire area again, the angel would show up behind the silence, easily killing it.
4. Now, I don't remember any instance of a dead silence. It could have the same effects when it's dead as it does alive or the effect could be negated, but since they are not a known race before they appear to Amy it is assumed that a dead silence is still impossible to remember without an external memory bank.

Whereas the woman showed some signs of recognizing that she said everything before, but shrugged it off, the angel would likely continue it's search, trying to kill whatever is stopping its memory. One part of the area that the angel and the silence are in would go unremembered to the angel and it would keep trying to search that area, knowing that whatever it is trying to kill is inside.

There is very strict regulations on some firearms such as Assault rifles and pistols, lesser (but still significantly strict in comparison with the US) regulation on firearms such as shotguns and rifles. My Grandfather and Uncle both own several shotguns, as my father did before my mum made him give them up.

Firearms are restricted in the UK because of legislation passed by parliament, the legislative branch of the UK government. We previously held access to firearms as a right in the 'unwritten constitution', this was formerly written in the Bill of rights written after the Glorious Revolution. The right was limited over time as the benefits of an armed populace for national defence, self protection was reduced by the creation of larger and professional armed forces and importantly the creation of police forces.

You asked why not ban alcohol as guns have been banned. Well as you have learned firearms are not banned, access to them have been restricted. The same process if true of alcohol, over the years access to alcohol for children has been greatly reduced for example, also court order can be issued banning persons from getting drunk, drink drive laws have been introduced and Local Authorities (similar to American city councils) can create 'alcohol free zones' where public consumption of alcohol is banned. 

Simply because alcohol kills some people does not mean it should be banned, the same is true of firearms. The same is also true of cars, trains and central heating systems. It is reasonable to limit access to firearms as the danger they pose to both society and the rule of law has been viewed by Parliament, the courts and the public as a whole, is greater then the cost of the loss of liberty.

Is killing in self-defense not a legitimate function, though? What about the sporting function? That's also legitimate. Alcohol doesn't have a single legitimate function.

&gt; Alcohol is a socially pleasurable drug that is tolerated in society because in general the downsides are limited and alcohol has a wide range of functions - of which death by accident is a very minor aspect.

It's pretty much impossible to use a gun for self-defense in the UK. Nobody is allowed to own a handgun and long guns must be stored at home unloaded and locked in a safe.

true,refcon,null,null,"There is a significant difference in the law regarding self defence between the UK and the US.

1)The UK - In the UK we have a Common Law right to self defence of 'reasonable force'. This means that in order to defend yourself you can use appropriate level of force - if someone pushes you, you cant gouge their eyes out. You would however be able to punch them (depends on police then courts whether force was appropriate). If someone attacks you with a  knife you could legally be able to stab them in return - the force used is reasonable to the threat. 

We have in the UK had several cases where this Common Law right has come to criticism. The first was [Tony Martin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Martin_\(farmer\)) a farmer who shot 2 people who burgled his house. He would have been in his right to shoot the people had he felt threatened for his life, but he shot them when they were leaving. He was therefore using excessive (and therefore illegal force) and found guilty of attempted murder. It was believed by many that he should have the right to defend his property using more then reasonable force, which leads us to...

2)The US- In the US you have both a Common Law right to self defence (your legal system was inherited from the UK when you rather unsportingly declared independence) as well as several Statute Laws (laws passed by the legislature) which govern the level of force allowed to be used. These allow for more then reasonable force, such as the 'Stand your Ground' law in Florida or the 'Castle doctrine' in Texas. 

In the UK we have tried to move closer to your system on several occasions but it falls down as those laws essentially states an unreasonable level of force can be used. This doesn't work within the current English and Welsh (I cant speak for Scots or Irish) law. 

Guns are rarely used for self defence as the level of force you would have to face would be life threatening, which as guns are less prevalent in the UK the ability for criminals to threaten life is reduced. There have however been cases where the use of force involving firearms has been deemed lawful. 

I personally would be in favour of slightly less restrictive gun laws as the ones on the books now were written after a massacre of children at a primary school.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; I don't know a huge amount about prostitution, but I don't think 19yr old girls are offering unprotected anal sex for £40 on adultwork of their own free will.

Y'know, if they're not, then it's the men who are coercing them who you should be going after.

I have taken occasional titillation in browsing AdultWork and the going rate is £100 an hour. A bit more or less, maybe £20 each way, depending on how pretty the girl is. 

There are a few girls who charge considerably more and who are, presumably, satisfied with the amount of work they get charging £250+ per hour.

However there aren't very many girls charging the rate you mention - I've certainly never seen that rate advertsied, so this is clearly an extreme corner case.

I have heard of one woman who advertises on there who is famous for bareback gangbangs, and I'm pretty sure she's cheap, too. I've read other girls saying that she loves it, and that they go through her reviews to see which punters have left feedback, so they can blacklist those guys (for their own protection).

Honestly, with some experience of kinky girls, it wouldn't surprise me if a girl offering unprotected anal for £40 is doing so because she likes it. There are rare girls who like unprotected sex with strangers - who are going out and doing that every weekend. Sex with boyfriends isn't the same, protected sex doesn't feel the same - those aren't ""dirty"" enough to excite the girl in question. Obviously many girls *don't* feel this way, but some do.

There are certainly girls in your town who like unprotected sex with strangers - it's probably just not very many who actually indulge it (outside of swingers' contact groups with regular healthchecks). There are certainly girls in your town who like anal, and there are certainly girls in your town who like the idea of sexual humiliation that prostitution lends. Again, relatively few indulge that latter kink (there are many girls who are too shy to ask their boyfriends for anal, for fear of being thought ""dirty"", even though that's the appeal) but it doesn't seem incredible to me that there are one or two girls in this country who do actually get off this way. I understand the kink, even though I think it's absolutely blindingly stupid to indulge it.

Certainly, no working girl needs to charge so little. I think you're crazy to base your arguments on such an extreme and rare corner case. My former neighbour used to have at least a couple of visitors in a short working day, and I very much doubt she was charging less than the going rate of £80 an hour, protected. She commuted an hour each way, each day she worked (2 or 3 days a week) to ensure word wouldn't get back to her kids, and she drove a much nicer car than I do. For the record, she didn't enjoy the job very much, but she considered her choice to be working minimum wage in Tesco for much less money, being unable to take her kids to school and collect them at 4pm, and providing a much less comfortable lifestyle for them.

Finally, I doubt there are actually that many guys who want unprotected anal with a prostitute that advertises it! 

Irrespective of all that - yes, go on, criminalise the johns, it's hard to garner sympathetic voices for them. It doesn't matter that *some* are guilty, if you're criminalising all of them.

Again - how often do I need to say this? - ""it's one thing"" to ""actively propose a regulated sex trade"", but ministers aren't just doing that, they're attacking working girls and telling women what they can do with their bodies, because these politicians don't like their lifestyle and because they want to impose their morals on others.",0,1338019912,null,0,1338020130,0,c4sjqlz,t3_u48zr,t1_c4sjqlz,t1_c4sgdiq,null,1429003603,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,raggisnoora,lfc50,null,"Well that looks a bit crazy, not saying it wouldn't work though. In my experience when you have 3 in the back the wings are more like wing backs. You simply cant risk 4 on 4, which will happen unless like I said you have wing-backs or you could have two defensive midfielders. I highly doubt any manager who will manage this team will want to play 3-4-3 or 3-5-2 as a first choice. I'd imagine it being a last resort when you lack width in your team.

That being said, depending on the manager I think we'll see either the European mixture of 4-3-3/4-5-1 or the British 4-4-2. It's really a matter of what players are available this summer. The current squad fits  4-3-3 a lot better than 4-4-2, main reason being we don't have a right winger. This is how I see it:

**4-3-3**

*Benifits:*

* We have all the players needed (Reina; Enrique, Agger, Skrtel, Johnson; Gerrard, Lucas, Henderson; Downing, Carroll, Suarez)

* Most of the players know this system, some more than others though.

* Gerrard can have more of a free-role position

* We can play Henderson/Shelvey in this system without loosing much strength in midfield (I think they are both a bit shaky, but I think they will both have an immense role in the club after 3-4 years, especially Hendo)

* With a good holding defensive midfield most of our midfield problems will be obsolete from last season.

*Faults:*

* Carroll/Downing are under a huge pressure to deliver in this system since they are 2/3 of the attacking force.

* We can't loose anyone out to injury, apart from Downing, Johnson and Handerson with out weakening the XI (their replacements being: Bellamy, Kelly and Shelvey/Adam)

* Gerrard and Henderosn will have to be 5x better than last season if we are to have creative force that is good 
enough. They will be key-figures.

* (benefit/fault) we can see a certain performance slack in most other positions along as their 3rd of the field is on par (meaning, Enrique can slack if Agger/Skrtel play a bit better). But the risk is on: Downing/Carroll and Gerrard/Henderson

**4-4-2**

*Benefits:*

* We don't have to rely as much on Carroll and Downing

* There won't be as much pressure on the midfielders the whole season. Only two will have to play (that is if we 
sign a right winger) so they will have more rest

* This is a system that fits Downing better

* Carroll/Suarez combo

* We have a good cover for short term injuries in midfield.

* (benefit/fault): The risk is on Gerrard/Lucas and Suarez/Carroll which sounds a lot better than above. However 
we can't see much performance slack in other positions because the midfield doesn't have the same presence

*Faults:*

* Our defense becomes fragile with less cover from the midfield

* We don't have anyone that can play the right wing position properly (sure we CAN play Hendo or Johnson 
there, but I think we'd be better suited with someone else)

* Hendo/Shelvey will see less playing time

* We can't loose Gerrard or Lucas for a long time

* We have to sign another striker to cover for Suarez and Carroll

* We can't loose Agger or Skrtel to injury (Carra is too risky in this system)

Problems I have with other systems: Some of our XI players won't be able to play their optimal positions or the first team won't hold the best players we have got at our disposal (3-4-3/3-5-2: The defense will be: Agger, Skrtel and x. If the x is Johnson/Enrique they wont be playing their optimal position, if the x is Carrager/Coates then we are sacrificing one of the following: Johnson, Enrique, Hendo or Downing...It is most likely that it will be Enrique, who is better than Carra or Coates.)

I think I managed to get all my thoughts down, I'm not surprised though if I contradict my self somewhere. But I strongly believe we will see 4-3-3 next season compared to our current team.

With respect, you have gone from stating that the majority of gun owners are sensible and use them for sports ( as they do here in the UK) to self defense. The issues are different. Gun crime in rife in the US, due in part to the relaxed laws on gun sales and ownership. That is why  we have the laws we do have here.

This isn't true.

&gt; Fair enough, but give someone a gun, and it's likely to be the first thing they reach for rather than the last.

Here's the thing though: When I'm armed I do absolutely *everything* in my power to avoid confrontation. If you're perceived as an aggressor or even just somebody who didn't try to deescalate a hostile situation and you then use a firearm there's a good chance you won't be able to claim self-defense. Guns aren't for when somebody calls your girlfriend a slut, you say something nasty back, punches get thrown, and then you draw your weapon and fire. Guns are for when somebody has decided to attack you completely unprovoked and you have no ability to escape or avoid the confrontation and believe your life to be in immediate danger... that's when you draw your weapon and start firing.",0,1338025656,null,0,false,0,c4sk5qw,t3_u5q0r,t1_c4sk5qw,t1_c4sk23z,null,1429003807,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

It seems a shame to close the blinds and keep out the sunshine during the day but it's heating up your house. The same with having your windows open, especially if you live in a city.

For sleeping take a sheet and soak it in cold water. Wring it out and sleep under it. As your body heat dries the sheet it will cool you off. You'll probably wake up in the middle of the night and the sheet will be dry, if it is and you're still hot just dampen the sheet again. A fan at the end of the bed speeds up the process.

Another thing you can do is create a cold water bottle. Take a 1.5 or 2 litre coke bottle and fill it water. Stick it in the freezer early enough so that it will be frozen solid by bed time.

&gt; what practical skills did you learn

I can read and write a lot better than I used to be able to, but thats mainly down to my own efforts with reading a lot of books and practising with my writting. But I spent most of my time doing prison jobs, like most others there did. Really shit horrible dirty jobs, and doing it for about 20p an hour. Any job I get now is going to be a lot better than the prison jobs I did all the time, in every way (conditions, the work, the pay, ect.) This has toughened me up work wise because even the most shitty lowest paying job is going to be a huge step up and much better than what I'm used to. Which is quite good.

The courses they had specifically for rehabilitation were a bit useless to be honest. Things like anger management, and ones to do with drugs. I can't even remember what they were called let alone the things they taught, thats how useless those courses are. But then I was already doing all those kind of things under my own steam and didn't really need any help with it, so maybe they were helpful for others.

&gt; did prison work?

It has for me, but thats definitely not the case for everyone. 

&gt; Realistically is it a case of you not getting caught again or you not doing trouble again?

Its that I'm not doing anything wrong anymore. For two reasons, 1. Fear of going back to prison and 2. Because I just don't want to. I can't be bothered with all the nonsense I was getting up to when I was younger. Drinking, taking drugs and fighting all the time doen't have the same appeal that used to have. Whether or not thats because of prison is anyones guess.

true,[deleted],null,null,"A couple of things you hit on there interest me.

As a bit of disclosure, I'm interested in how the prison service can be reformed.  I'm all for allowing prisoners to earn a real working wage whilst in prison, so rather them leaving and then having to rebuild their lives from practically scratch, to have a managed nest egg when they leave.  Putting real commercial work into the prisons, allowing the inmates to have a small part of that wage when they're inside for luxuries and treats, put a significant part towards their upkeep (so actually paying for prison like others outside pay tax) and the rest, the larger part, put aside in either a savings or post office account.

I like the idea of you saying that given just time to mature and to be an older person you don't identify with the younger you, and whereas the younger 'you' was prone to mischief a more mature, older 'you' just isn't as inclined.  I have a problem with sentencing someone who's, for example, 20 and still punishing them for what they did when they're say 27.  I think they're literally, in most circumstances, completely different people whether they've spent that time in jail or not.

That builds me up to my next question.  You can Internet-Kick me in the bollocks if you want.  How would you consider prison terms (don't think of it of yourself because obviously you'd have wanted to get out as soon as possible) but if prison sentences were based more on when a working trade has been learned, money has been saved for a new start, and when the person age-wise has changed, as opposed to sentencing time wise for the crime?  Obviously you say your time inside drove you to read and so your literacy improved, but what if there was another level to that where they actually drove home a skill or a trade, and maybe you even stayed in for longer (maybe in an open prison) where they sort of replicated the mandatory regime of a school but for a tech/6th form college/university education and made sure you had not only learned but had put into practice and were earning.  Literally a second shot at state education but this time with a state parent checking your grades.

But I saw Remy play in this Year's champions league and he's good off the ball. And when he scores he usually does most the work himself.

So if Remy came to tottenham he'd get much better deliveries from Bale and Van der vaart (Possibly Modric). He's done brilliant for a side who came 10th in the league. He also scored 12 goals for them this season.

And Damiao is just 22, Remy is 25. Honestly, both of them would fit in well in our system

TBH, Mata's value greatly decreases if you shift him from the center to either side, and Mata is also REALLY good. So unless we change the system, (which is not justified by the addition of one player), it doesn't make a lot of sense to play Hazard centrally. We do, however, have a lot of holes to fill on the wings. Either wing that Hazard could play would help us greatly, but he's said that he prefers playing centrally. So if this is our plan, our chances of getting him are reduced. On the other hand, Hulk seems like a shoe in on either wing. While he's not quite as valuable, it's still likely a lot cheaper. I would also argue that goal-scoring form is more of an issue for Chelsea atm than creativity, which Hulk would probably help more. So for me, Hulk takes it by a bit.

Although offenders are usually warned, they are liable upon conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 under the terms of the Act.

Finally sent out another batch of decals yesterday. **To celebrate, i'm doing another giveaway today** :D

I also made a new site last week for selling decals because I can't use Etsy anymore, but I have no idea how to get people to visit it. If anyone has any advice on how to get the word out or can share it with other Whovians, that would be fantastic. www.busystudio.com Thanks!

**Today's Giveaways are;**

* 1. [10th Doctor](http://busystudio.myshopify.com/products/10th-doctor-decal)

* 3. Vashta Nerada
* 4. Ood &amp; Angel

&gt; I'll be following the same format to my other giveaways. All you need to do is leave a comment here. I'll leave entries open for 24 hours. After that no entries will be accepted.

&gt; Postage is free and includes international.

&gt; (How it works behind the scenes: All commenter names are collected and then put into some software that spits people at random)

**TL;DR**

Leaving a comment enters you into the competition to win a decal

Entries close 24hours after this is posted.

Sorry, but if we're not gonna overpay for him neither are fucking Arsenal. They need him less and they are even stingier than we are. 

If you look at some of the prices of defenders being sold in the last year of their contract, we're doing the right thing by being a little patient. 15m Euros is a ridiculous price when you look at what players like Clichy sold for. 

I have a massive mancrush on Jan, but even I can see that he's not the only target available. If Ajax are seriously going to take nothing less than 15m, they are probably not going to sell him this summer. If we save 2-3m on him, that money can go towards, say, a signing bonus for Adebayor or towards paying a player's wages for a season. 

Furthermore, there are even more recent quotes from him saying that he's not really even thinking about Arsenal--he wants to wait for Spurs and Ajax to get it done. If anything, the fact that he seems set on us should be even more reason to be a little patient. He's pretty clearly applying some subtle pressure on Ajax to just get it the fuck done. 

Maybe I'll get burned for this later, but I would be shocked if we didn't sign him within the next 2 weeks.

true,clarbri,null,null,"1. We're going to struggle to bring in top talent this year, I think.  We do have Europa League football (albiet by the backdoor of a cup win), so that will help a little bit.  I think Hoilett would be a good choice (young, talented, available for dirt cheap), especially with a view toward playing a front three.  We need a striker or two - Fletcher from Wolves (to allow us to play the same style as we do with Carroll - not exactly the same, but close) and de Jong (for something different) would be good choices, and I think we could get both of them.  Jose Angel from Roma could be a good option to provide some cover/competition for Enrique.  I'd like a couple of new options in midfield - maybe Aquilani could provide one of those, but I somehow doubt it, and I think we'll look to offload him (or, possibly, he'll look to offload us).  I wonder if Udinese would him + cash for Asamoah.  Diame might be a good buy - enough quality to cover for Lucas without being an unsettling presence.  Young-ish, as well, so could get better.


2. I think we'll look to play a 4-3-3/4-5-1 (which, with our squad, could end up being largely the same thing).  A lot of people are taking it as written that we'll play 3-4-3 under Martinez, but I think he's more adaptable than that and will play whatever suits our squad best.  That said, we've got some players (or could bring some in) that make that 3-4-3 a very attractive option.  I think tactically, we'll be much the same as we were this year:  high-posession attacking football backed up by a solid defense.  Possibly with the ball on the floor a bit more often.


3.  I think Flanagan and Shelvey could use some time on loan, Flanno especially.  Robinson as well.  Depending on who we bring in/how we line up in midfield, Spearing could be out as well.  Cole and Aquilani would probably be shipped out as well (hopefully permanently and not on loan).  Maxi and Kuyt are probably as good as gone, although I wouldn't mind hanging on to one of them.


4. While top 4 is the ultimate goal, I think we'd be setting ourselves up for disappointment if we made that the official goal for the first season.  Fifth or Sixth for the first season is probably a more realistic bet.  Other than that, good showings in the cup competitions would be the goal, with a look towards bringing another piece of silverware home (ideally, the Europa League).


5. 2-3 years minimum, baring a disaster.  Sacking another manager quickly is going to make it near impossible to bring in anyone qualified.


6.  Unless we're in the bottom 4 (or close to it) come Christmas, we've got to stick wth him, for the reasons above.  ",0,1338053594,null,0,false,0,c4sn5j4,t3_u4lt0,t1_c4sn5j4,t3_u4lt0,null,1429005210,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/azerbaijan/9291718/Mass-arrests-and-detentions-in-Azerbaijan-ahead-of-Eurovision-Song-Contest.html

&gt;Around a hundred protesters congregated by the promenade overlooking Crystal Hall last night, the stadium where an estimated 26,000 fans will flock to watch the final, and begun to shout slogans demanding democratic freedoms and the release of political prisoners.
In front of shocked onlookers, uniformed police and plainclothes security officials pounced on demonstrators and dragged them through the crowd. Some tried to resist but were bundled into awaiting patrol cars and city buses commandeered especially for the event.
Islam Shixli, a journalist for the local Azadliq newspaper was one of the detained, despite wearing a clearly visible fluorescent yellow press jacket.

&gt;Fuad Hasanov, a human rights activist who was monitoring the demonstration, said: “If the Eurovision was not being held here right now, in the presence of the international media, I am sure that the consequences would be much worse. “ Dawn Gonzalez, a Canadian fan who witnessed the arrests was surprised by what she saw: “It is a shame because I think it is a great opportunity for the country to put a good foot forward on the world stage but, based on what I have seen today, I’m not so sure.”

&gt;The event is rapidly becoming a PR headache for the oil rich, post-Soviet republic. International coverage has seen glitzy images of Baku and Eurovision performances juxtaposed with footage of police brawling with peaceful demonstrators.

...

&gt;Activists have also been using the rare presence of foreign press in the country to advance their cause and further protests on Saturday are highly likely. Many opposition members are concerned about the consequences of their actions. Fuad Marasov added: **“When all of you leave, there will be a new wave of oppression.”**

After you've caught up with the new Who, then you can go back and sample the classic series. It's very different, and for some an aquired taste. It varies a LOT between 1963-1989. It suffered from cheesy plots, and low to no budget special effects from time to time. In spite of the limitations, it was sometimes excellent. However, modern viewers have a hard time with the oldest episodes. I usually advise starting in the 80's and working back. The 5-7th Doctors often had better budgets and stories. The 4th Doctor is an icon, a fan favorite, but he had a long and inconsistent run. The 3rd Doctor was often earthbound, but had help from a good supporting cast. The 1st &amp;amp;amp; 2nd Doctors are difficult, and thier stories are incomplete, due to the loss of many episodes.

Don't forget one of my favorites, the 8th Doctor. He has only the 1996 ""Doctor Who the Movie"" to represent him on film, but there's lots of audio adventures that feature him. He has the most amazing TARDIS! The movie was intended to be a pilot for a 1990's reboot of the series, unfortunately that didn't happen till 2005.

But the way websites work is that your computer connects to the server and says ""I want the content of reddit.com"", then the server sends back the html text of that page.

It would be far easier to mandate that all browser vendors disable cookies by default, and then users could choose to enable them (just as soon as they see how well YouTube works without).

true,[deleted],null,null,"I don't like the idea of commercial work as a privilege, that sounds like the prison is more punishment than rehabilitation.  I like the idea of work as being mandatory towards release. So the problem I suppose you're saying is how can I have 100% of the prison population either working, or doing training so they can work, when they've got a prison to run.  You got me thinking but I can't get away from a couple of things.  Lots of people go to work and still run their own homes, cooking, laundry - I realise we're talking about a prison and it's a slightly bigger operation but still, how much cleaning can there be if everybody had to either put an hour in before the day or at the end?  I can imagine there might be some jobs that require more full time work but then again I can't imagine it not being something that all year-one prisoners couldn't cope with.  Even then I can see the canteen being run as catering business as well as somewhere that feeds the prison.  Even when learning a trade like mechanic or stone mason or welder I can see how 3-6months in the canteen and being taught how to run a business, to handle your taxes, employment law etc, could be beneficial.  I can also see how prison tiffin boxes could go down a storm in city lunch trade and schools.

What I am left with is the impression from the media that many people are repeat offenders.  It costs £45k to house a prisoner for a year (how so much I don't know, it's not like once you've built the prison you have to keep paying for a new one to be built) but that means that 'year one' of rehabilitation for a three time offender has ended up costing 3x£45k.  If they learn the same thing rehabilitation-wise in year one for a 3x offender it ends up costing the state £135k plus court fees in putting him there.  I wouldn't 'give' the prisoners money, there'd have to be a product or a business model, but even if we were to give every prisoner a £20k salary it would only cost £2billion, and I'm willing to bet a prisoner walking out of prison after 3 years but with close to £30,000 in the bank, after he's been paying some taxes and some of his electricity etc., and a fresh education, finds it a lot easier to break the cycle. 

I even pay a resident's property management fee to the building, why shouldn't prisoners?  Two hundred quid over the year from eveyone into a pot, and any unpleasant prison job or somebody who's struggling to stay in a work programme will at least be able to be employed minimum wage by their own fellow prisoners.",0,1338062067,null,0,false,0,c4soj6q,t3_u4q4c,t1_c4soj6q,t1_c4skpic,null,1429005871,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

As a person who has worked in a few pubs over the years, I have had this same experience.

And it's not just because they are easier to forge, it's also because most staff are not trained on what to look for when dealing with £50 note forgeries because pubs have such a high staff turnover rate that most won't ever see one, and because whoever accepts it is usually responsible for paying for it if it is fake.

In all the pubs where I worked, any staff member who had been there more than 6 months knew how to check for dodgy £50 notes. We were even shown how to check the ink instead of relying on the little UV lights after an incident in another pub in town that lost £500 in one night to some travellers who had coated some forgeries with sun tan lotion to reflect the UV lights.

Only at the very end of the episode does the doctor state that River told him his name. And I also agree with Jentacular saying:

Since a lot of the workers are from outside the country on temporary visas, accommodations and ,occasionally, meals are provided and ,depending on distances traveled, car sharing/transport is arranged. The company is generally pleasant but the work is hard and it takes a while to learn to flow. 

If you do this, i wish you the best, you don't usually see locals doing the work.

edit: if you're physically fit and would like to stay in the city, you can do festival venue preparation work (tent raising, moving things around, etc).

true,[deleted],null,null,"I've heard of other countries that have work placement schemes for their prisoners but I don't know where the idea of making sure prisoners leave prison with a healthy bank account came from.  It just seems intuitive to me.  You can either lock someone up in a cell for being a detriment to society where he's only going to be a further drain and grow resentful, or you can put him to productive use.  And if the purpose is rehabilitation then making sure going to prison doesn't mean you go back to scratch and having to build everything up again when you come out seems like a no brainer.

In that sense I don't like the idea of prison sentences being considered only in terms of time.  Obviously there'd have to maximum jail terms but rather than somebody unemployed getting 2 years for say a vehicle related crime I'd far rather a judge say ""you obviously like cars, you're going on a prison mechanics course and you're not coming off it until you're a qualified mechanic, you've paid compensation to the owner of the car, and you've got ten grand in the bank so when you come out you can move away and actually buy your own motor instead of nicking one.  As soon as you meet that criteria you'll be released.  Get busy.""   If they want to learn a different trade because they'd enjoy it more, fair enough.

And if it takes 6 months for a place on a prison mechanics course, like you say, they can go work in the laundry on minimum wage.

Councils spend billions to get certain jobs done.  £53 billion to be exact and a lot of it will be put up for tenure.  Every prisoner in the system on £20k would cost just 2 of those billion, and I'm willing to bet some prisons wouldn't have a 70% re-offending rate either, so the population would go down.  It's win win really because with less crime there's less policing and court costs, which means more money could go to the councils.

And whilst the debate is already out there as to whether prisoners should be allowed to vote I don't see why if prisoners are paying their own taxes and supplementing the cost of running the prison why they shouldn't have a say, in a vote, as to where some of those taxes are spent on in their prison.  At least then you're encouraging a community and prison cohesion instead of people being stabby.  They'd be working collectively to actually improve the prison.

Would people really go for it if in reality it meant some of the shorter sentences got longer? 6 months work, training and saving isn't really going to achieve a lot.  I suppose if that's what the sentences are changed to for people going in I suppose they won't have much choice in it  [I'm edging towards a minimum sentence along the lines of the same time people spend willingly studying to get the exams that allow them to go to university.

For example operating a shopping basket when the user is not logged in could be built using cookies, and you do not need to ask for consent. The guidelines went further then this, but guidelines are not law, and they are just being relaxed to match.

You can also push consent into a terms and conditions. For example you could store the users session id in a cookie, to track if they are logged in, and to auto login when they return. In both cases you just say ""by signing up/logging in you are agreeing to our terms and conditions"", and in the terms you say you use cookies. That gets around it. That is also covered by the previous example.

What this law ultimately comes down to is Google Analytics (and similar services). They are not allowed without prior consent (implied or otherwise), as they are not and crucial to the website. This has not changed, and so this change in guidelines means very little. It still means you technically have to tell your users you're tracking their usage when they first visit, which sucks.

However ICO have said they will not be actively searching for sites that use analytics without asking for consent, they will only be acting on complaints. So if no one complains, you can get away with it (but you are breaking the law).

Over the last few years, we've either paid an artist or group who were famous decades ago (think Scooch or Humperdinck) to produce another mediocre song just to place last, or done a fucking reality TV show to pick a crappy contestant and occasionally pulling out all the stops and having Andrew Lloyd Webber crap out another mediocre piece of songwriting.

I say instead, we just enter an unsigned rock band (rock is something you NEVER see in Eurovision, it's all just cheesy bubblegum pop or ballads often containing at least one made-up language entry per every few years, in fact, the highest points winner in Eurovision before they changed the rules were Lordi in 2006? And they were a fucking metal band.) There are loads of unsigned bands across the nation that would be itching to at least be given a chance in the limelight. What we should be doing as a nation is secretly hiring a record label executive to scout out this unsigned talent then giving them a chance at Eurovision stardom.

* If they get nul pois? Fair enough, they had nothing to gain anyway, and we basically got our act for almost nothing.
* If they do well? Give them a fucking major record contract. You've basically scouted talent on the cheap.

First situation: If no sufficiently strong coalition can be formed, the government would tell the monarch to dissolve parliament and hold a second election.

Second situation: Technically, yes, that is possible, but it won't happen because of game theory. Any attempt to refuse to co-operate with parliament would be met with an immediate uprising to overthrow it and turn the Kingdom into a Republic, and then the law would be passed anyway.

&gt;This is not secure. Security is essential to a website. 

And what is your reason for saying that it is insecure and how is it any less secure than saving the session id to disk? Also, security isn't essential to a website, it's essential to ***some*** websites which deal with information that needs to be kept secure. If you just want to display some static text, what security considerations need to be taken into account?

&gt;Also you don't need to remain logged in to a site?

Of course you don't. Unless you actually want your room mates making comments for you. Like I said earlier, some people consider persistent sessions a security flaw.

&gt;You want to log in every time you hit the voting buttons on reddit?

No, but why would you need to given that you have a non-cookie based session?
