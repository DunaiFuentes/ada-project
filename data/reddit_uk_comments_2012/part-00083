true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Interesting, and I'll preface this by commending you for a rather eloquent compilation of your thoughts, although I add just a few remarks of my own in response...

&gt;Then the really big New Fan: the person who blogs to their friends ""Omg I just found this amazing new show"" and then they marathon the new series. They gush on and on about a particular character they may adore. Rose, 10, 11...This is a pretty short stage.

I disagree here. You seem to think that delving into Classic Who is va vital step before becoming a ""true fan"" that is analytical beyond the initial gushing, and that this stage is a brief phase, but there are so many here that prove this wrong.

I, for example, have delved very little into Classic Who, but I would hardly call my fandom a brief initial phase. I've written whole articles discussing and dissecting the show simply on the merits of New Who (it is, after all, six seasons. That's more than many other shows get in their entire run, let alone all of the feature-lenth specials New Who has had).

Suffice it to say that a love of New Who and New Who alone is not the mark of the unexperienced nubian all bubbly and excited over something they barely comprehend yet, but it's just a particular brand of fan (a fairly popular brand, given the availability of New Who online, but I'll get to that later).

Trust me, New Who on it's own has enough facets to analyze, critique, and deeply enjoy that does not require looking back on all that followed it. I certainly wouldn't call fan's of Nolan's interpretation of Batman going through an 'initial phase' if they haven't gone through the 70+ years of shows, films, and comics that led to them.

Basically, you seem to think that the point of fandom is to voraciously spread outward, but I'm precisely the opposite: I tunnel inward. I place individual episodes under a microscope and analyse their facets with meticulous detail, and would imagine attempting to spread myself across the titanic compendium of all things Doctor Who would spread my knowledge very thin to the point where I'd be striving for quantity over quality comprehension.

Not to say that either interpretation of fandom is either right or wrong. Fans are people, and as such are unique and individual creatures. Everyone will express their fanaticism in unique ways and there's certainly nothing wrong with that.

Ultimately the progression to fandom is even more simpler than how you've described it.

**There is discovery, consumption, digestion, and creation**.

These take many forms, but are ultimately the stages of all fans, from the zealotous to the mild.

(Oh, and returning to the topic of New Who being more available than Classic, it's clear that Netflix allows the freedom to binge on the shows you love, inspiring fandom much more easily than attempting to track down all of Classic.)

**EDIT**: OP since reworked her post to describe her own personal journey and not a holistic one of fans in general. I've got a bit of egg on my face since this might come across as far too accusatory than I actually intended.

I never say that you have to get into classic to get past the gushing thing. That kind of happens on its own. And before I talked about a fan considering classic I state that a fan would want to get into discussions about stuff (I cited the example of companions).

That description I made that you're quoting was for a new fan. You've been a fan for a while now haven't you? I mean I guess new is a subjective term. Some would call my three years as a fan ""new"", but I digress.

I never said that you need to look back on classic to analyze or critique or enjoy something. But you do need to watch classic to see how the show progresses over many decades. That's why I said that a person would be able to do this after they watched classic. It's not like this is a checklist of things fans must do. It's just a progression many will take.

&gt;Basically, you seem to think that the point of fandom is to voraciously spread outward

No, I don't. I didn't make any statements about the ""point of fandom"". In fact, I don't even think fandom has a point. Like candy. There's no point to candy. We just do it because we can. Because it's fun. It isn't a job or a qualification or a checklist.

The reason for this is that in future you can increase the number of run trains on it, or use it as a diversionary route in times of service disruption. If you have stopped running on it then all the housing estates that have sprung up along the way start to moan like fuck that there are trains running on the train line at the back of their house and complaining to every man and his dog using the simple phrase ""there were no trains running on that line when we moved in""  So with at least one train per week running when a solicitor does the searches before you buy your house it will show up as having a train service and the solicitor will include the warning that this service could increase, you have therefore been warned and can't claim that the railway has devalued your property.

The biggest scandal thats going on with housing at the moment is the propping up of the private sector in the form of housing benefits and guaranteed 5 year rent schemes for private landlords, thats whats fucking everything up. its a fucking scandal, we dont build council housing no more.

The right to buy was the first attack on council housing which was probably lobbied for by private interests, and its been downhill ever since. Every privatised service in this country has brought problems for the population, as can be seen across every single privatised service. Not one of them has brought any benefit to the public all have to be subsidised by the public purse, costing 3, 4, 10, 20, 100 times what it cost to keep it in public hands, all the while lying to us that it will be more efficient at providing the service and ultimately at cutting costs. 

The private companies do cut costs definitly but at the expense of the service, and the benefit of the shareholders. Those same services are then scuttled and each portion is privatised again, thereby increasing costs which double, quadruple and more all adding stress and misery to those who are forced to use them.

Fucking hell, I've even had operations in private hospitals, paid for by the NHS, simple operations that once were provided as routine, where the NHS can no longer provide them as their simple in-house services are privatised. All costing millions more than they used to...

My mum was in hospital over Christmas, and I got a phone call from her at 2 am telling me that she needed a drink and the nurses were ignoring her. She was still a bit loopy from all the drugs so I assumed she was just confused and I called the ward to tell them that she was upset and she needed a drink. I spoke to the ward-sister and she said that she would get her a drink and go and sit with her for a while.

At 4 am, mum rang me again. They still hadn't brought her a drink. I tried to call the ward, but there was no answer. I drove to the hospital, went to her ward and gave her a drink myself.

I (a 32 year old man) just walked straight into a female ward without anyone trying to stop me. No nurses, no security, the only person I saw was an old man on a drip; stood in the hallway starring at the wall.

I sat with her for a while and at about 5 am a nurse bobbed her head through the door, and disappeared again. I chased her down the hallway and explained what had happened.

true,gooneruk,cnty-england,London,"I was in Clapham Junction on the main night of rioting there. Got there whilst there were still some police (in riot gear) around, and before any shops got broken into. I was stood on [this junction](http://goo.gl/maps/VW4Z) for the start of the rioting, and then went down St John's Road as the attention shifted there.

I took my video camera with me, and you can see some of my HD footage on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/gooneruk/videos). You'll also see a chunk of it (including some not on Vimeo) on a BBC2 documentary later this month, called ""RIOTS: IN THEIR OWN WORDS: PART ONE: THE RIOTERS"".

The crowd was pretty big, I'd say more than a thousand people and most looked to be in an age range between 14-18. Most of the bystanders and onlookers were older, from mid-20s through to about 40. The racial make-up amongst the crowd was heavily black and mixed race, which is a reflection of the estates in the Clapham/Battersea area, in my experience.

After about half an hour of some relatively fruitless attacks on the JD Sports, attention switched to the big Debenhams on the corner. It got broken into, and people were in/out non-stop, grabbing mostly jewellery, watches and some clothes.

At this point, the police completely abandoned the area. They were originally in a line across St John's Road, preventing the crowd from going further down that main shopping street. The only shops being attacked at that stage were on the corner: Debenhams and JD Sports.

You can see in my video [Ransacking Debenhams](http://vimeo.com/27458844) how the police retreated and then dispersed in cars/vans, leaving the street completely unprotected. Until that point, there had been no damage done to 99% of the shops in Clapham Junction.

Obviously, all hell then broke loose.

The crowd moved down St John's Road, attacking various shops. I stayed up on the corner for a while, because the crowd was still big there, and there were a few shops getting smashed in there anyway. The zoom on my camera's pretty decent, so I got some good footage.

Trainers and sports gear were a big draw, and I lost count of the number of Foot Locker bags that I saw. Some people couldn't wait to get back home, and so were putting on multiple jumpers/jackets right there and then. I was amused at how many had bothered to take coathangers too.

My favourite moment was seeing one lad come back out of Debenhams, cross the road and go up to two girls. The first of the girls looked at his bags and his hands full of stuff, and said to him (really loudly) ""What you got for me then?!"" It was a touching moment, truly...

Another good sight was seeing a guy walking away from Currys with some kind of ipod dock stereo system in a box, some other electronic device also in a box, and then, perched on top, an extension multiplug. That's some good robbing, right there. A practical thief.

I then moved down St John's Road, filming as I went and getting a bit more up close and personal. At times, I had to keep my camera hidden from view, or shooting quite literally from the hip, as a number of rioters were getting aggressive towards those taking pictures or filming. I saw a number of people running away at full sprint, being chased by a couple of rioters.

It was interesting to see which shops got attacked and ransacked. Currys was absolutely gutted, whereas the Waterstones practically next door didn't have a scratch. Likewise the Jamie Oliver deli place, whereas TK Maxx was nigh-on empty.

I made a list on my phone at the time of which places had been attacked, and it was about 50-items long. And that didn't include a few others on St John's Hill, which I didn't see until later on.

Things were starting to fade out a little by then, and all the talk amongst the rioters was ""Where's next?"". Phones were out constantly, and were either glued to ears or had fingers flying across. I can't say whether Blackberrys were the most common, as I didn't notice. It wasn't until reading news reports the next day that I heard about BBM organising everything.

Everyone was talking about Stockwell or Brixton as the next destination, but I wasn't up for following the crowd, and headed back to the station to go home. There, I saw about 4 police at the main entrance, I guess stopping people who looked like rioters. They were the first police I'd seen for about 3 hours.

When I got home, I flicked on the news and saw that the party shop on the junction was now up in flames, something I must've missed by a matter of minutes. There hadn't been any fires until then, just smashed windows and wrecked shop interiors.

This may not be completely relevant, but just yesterday, I was taking my elderly father out to go get an eye test, and as we were walking, he happened to trip over something and fall before I could catch him, landing on his face and cutting his nose/hand. Blood everywhere basically. Since we were around the corner from his doctors surgery, I thought I could just walk him there and clean him up, get some first aid, etc. His injuries weren't serious enough to call an ambulance or visit the A&amp;E I thought, as I do know a bit of first aid, but didn't have any plasters, bandages on me, etc, and he showed no sign of concussion.

Now, I know I shouldn't expect help from a busy doctors surgery, but the place was empty, no patients in the waiting room. Apparently all the doctors were busy, the nursing staff were out, and the receptionists couldn't offer first aid, despite one of them actually being a nurse, as she had seen my father before.

We ended up going miles away to a walk-in centre.

Having been in that situation myself - this is an issue of attitude and long term thinking.

Yes, my first job after unemployment paid a lousy wage, and I was basically working for about £1 an hour in real terms. However, I looked at it as a stepping stone to a better job, not as my long term career choice.

Now there may well be people who are happy on £5.50 per hour, and we shouldn't force them to upgrade if they don't want to. The taxpayer should, and indeed must, subsidise their income where they are unable to earn enough to live on due to outside factors - but when a person chooses to live on the breadline, then that is their choice, and not something that should be dependent on a taxpayer subsidy.

Who cares whether the UK is a kingdom or not? Arguably it's not a kingdom now. A monarch is someone with power over a nation, but ours isn't, so calling our ""Queen"" a Queen is inaccurate - it's just a historic left-over name without the original meaning. A name is just a name. Plenty of names are what they are for historic reasons, or for no reason at all. If ""Queen"" is OK for a person without the power of a monarch, why not ""United Kingdom"" for a fragmented democracy?

Did anyone prosecute the ""Deutsche Demokratische Republik"" for not being ""Demokratische""?

My name is ""Stephen"" - apparently something to do with the Greek for a crown. But I don't have a crown. My reddit name is based on a dragon in a Terry Pratchett book, in turn named after the boss of the bookkeeper that created it. I'm not a dragon, nor am I the boss of any bookkeepers.

true,Mr_Wolfgang_Beard,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Nope nope nope nope. Any weapon that ends up being legalised for self defence ends up being easier to get a hold of by criminals. Despite what you might think legalising a weapon puts you in *more* danger than you used to be.

Imagine these two different scenarios:

1. A 30 year old street fighter attempts to mug you.

2. An 8 year old chav wannabe attempts to mug you.

In the first case it is pretty likely that you will get beaten up and successfully mugged. Even if you are above average in your self defence skills, you have to admit that that this scenario is rather dangerous (compared to the other one).

In the second case you will probably just laugh at the kid and walk away, or maybe give him a smack round the head for good measure. Even if you are unfortunately below average in your self defence skills, you have to admit that option 2 is really low risk compared to option 1.

Now give everybody weapons that ""even the field"" (E.g. a gun or a taser).

We will assume that (because you are a law abiding citizen with good morals) you will not want to use your weapon until you are left with no other choice. We will assume that your attackers will confront you with their weapons already drawn, and that they have no problem with using an unreasonable and illegal amount of force to enfocre their unreasonable and illegal demands.

In the first case you have evened the playing field a little bit and you have more of a chance to defend yourself. However you are still in a lot of trouble and the danger has not been reduced by much.

In the second case things are different. The amount of danger present has increased massively, and you now have to take this threat a lot more seriously than before.

If we give the dangers numerical values then without weapons the danger for the 30 year old was 10 and the 8 year old was 1, so had ""5 Danger"" on average. Introducing weapons reduces the 30 year old to 8, but increases the 8 year old to 4 - you have ""6 Danger"" on average which is an increase.

**TL;DR:** An arms race never makes you safer unless you are at the very bottom of the food chain. On average you will be in more danger (Just look at the Cold War for the most famous and potentially disasterous arms race in history). Rather than demand new laws that let us defend ourselves (new laws that would put us in more danger), we should demand better police forces and an improved justice system (things that will put us in less danger).",0,1341311763,null,0,false,0,c58tzt3,t3_vy2nw,t1_c58tzt3,t1_c58t8nm,null,1429286058,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Fact is, law abiding citizens will and will continue to be attacked, mugged, killed by criminals who Use weapons that are impossible to own as law abiding civilians (see; pistol crime) or knifes, or simply be better fighters.

Can an animal realistically give consent to sex with a human - or was it simply conditioned to behave in that manner, and therefore intellectual consent was not implied.

I recall a related debate which was fascinating in that it drew out the prejudices of the audience so well.

If we can build a robot that simulates sex with an adult - it can be presumed to not need consent to run what is effectively just a software/hardware programme. But if consent is not a problem, then should we build robots in a form that would satisfy the sexual urges of paedophiles?

Some said that as abuse of a human was not occurring, it should be permitted, while others fell back onto moral revulsion at the very concept of paedophilia, and even ""harmless"" methods of releasing that tension in the person were not to be countenanced.

* a 26 year old aikido expert
* a 60 year old lady

We'll pick an average mugger, so the 26 year old aikido expert has no problems, but the little old lady is fucked. And, y'know, if the attacker is a rapist, then that sentence reads literally.

So a gun is (as American self-defence proponents say) the great leveller - it doesn't matter than women are on average weaker than men, they and the infirm need no longer be victims to muscular predators. 

And, y'know, the average British mugging is pretty easy and low risk. You're in a quiet side-street near a park, you know the area - you're not going to get caught if you mug someone and run away. For the culprit, an unarmed victim makes them perfectly safe.

If there's only a 1 in 100 chance that that guy walking down the street might have a gun in his pocket - well, suddenly the stakes are a lot higher, aren't they?

Even if the criminal is armed, criminals are shit at gun handling. They don't go down the range and shoot off 100 rounds at targets once a month, they don't take ""gun safety"" courses, which teach preparedness and stance. 

So even if the criminal is armed, too, the victim actually now has the advantage - because their gun ownership license requires them to take training.

And fuck it, even if the odds are 50:50, muggers are going to get shot and word's going to get 'round on the street that Bob died committing a mugging and - y'know what? - this shit isn't worth it. 

There are [countless studies that show that legalising conceal carry has led to lower crime rates in the USA](http://cornerbar.areavoices.com/2010/03/30/as-concealed-carry-permits-rise-gun-deaths-fall/). There's a town in the USA that mandates that every home must have a gun for self-defence - the burglary rate has only dropped in the decades since the town ordinance was passed.

Honestly, am I arguing for a relaxation of gun laws in the UK? No, not really - not in our cultural climate.

What I am arguing here is *NOT* cherry-picking your examples and anec-data, making **bold** statements and pretending like the stuff you made up proves your bullshit point just because you happen to say it does.

Policing and the justice system are only a secondary solution to crime - it's only treating the symptoms. If you have meningitis, the doctor doesn't say ""oh, we'll drain your brain fluid to ease the pressure a bit"", instead he gives you drugs which will kill the actual bacteria causing the inflammation. The real solution to crime is a fair and equal society, so that people don't want to commit crimes, so people aren't born poor and forced to live their lives in deprivation, so that people feel they can achieve success in their life though work and legal means.

And the biggest one we seem to have is lack of regulation, which is essential to keep the free market free. So I would say the reality of the situation we're in right now is that the balance between business and people tipped to far towards business over the last 30 years (where as previously it had been to far toward people), and it needs some adjustment to get things back on track. 

As for replacing capitalism, so far no one has really come up with a better idea. We tried communism and various forms of socialism, but that just seemed to result in a gigantic state attempting (and failing) to micromanage absolutely everything. And at it's best, this idea of state control was never as flexible or agile as more liberal economic approaches, which is why the west got so far ahead of the Soviets during the cold war.

I've seen the idea of libertarian socialism mooted quite often, but the problem with this is that while it would probably work quite well in a small culturally homogeneous group (around 100 people with a similar world view), no one has really been able to explain how it would work in a larger group with a more diverse population (40K people, with a wide range of world views), and it seems to be limited by dunbars number. Technology can help, but even if you're part of multiple groups or using computers/social networking to build bigger groups your still limited by your brains inability to directly deal with more than around 120 people.

Whats the statistical average for muggings and assaults? 16-25 year olds? I don't know but I doubt its 30 year old street fighters and 8 year olds... kind of making your hypothetical pointless .

Congratulations on missing my point entirely. I used extreme examples so that it would be easier to understand. There are no statistics for what I'm explaining so you're going to have to use your common sense:

There are a lot of bad people in the world. Many of those people want to rob you, and some of them will try to do so. **Some people will not try to rob you because they are unable to.** Teenage girls are more likely to be mugged than proffessional rugby players because they are easier targets. Giving everybody easier access to weapons makes everyone an easier target. Nobody is safer. Lets imagine that I am a criminal:

 * With my bare hands I can easily rob people smaller and weaker than me.
 * With a knife I can easily rob people smaller than me and people who are a little bit bigger than me.
 * With a gun I can easily rob anybody who is not also armed with a gun.

Weapons exist to give the owner an advantage. It is an eternal ""one up on you"" game. Hypothetically we could reach a stage where there is a weapon so dangerous that everybody is on a completely even playing field (a newborn babe could kill a soldier in a tank with as much ease as a soldier in a tank could killl a newborn babe), but it should be obvious why that is a really bad goal to have. If you don't understand why arms races are a bad idea then go look up the Cold War on wikipedia.

&gt;Ban for pistols , handgun crime increases.

I'm not going to bother talking about this for very long. It is suffice to say that it is a flawed argument. Laser Pistols are banned, however we have not seen an increase in crime involving Laser Pistols. This is because Laser Pistols are *hard to get* (they do not actually exist) and as a result they are not involved in crime. A ban is only effective if the ban is effective. You've used tautology to say *""The ban will be ineffective in removing all the illegal weapons. Therefore the illegal weapons will be used in crime, which means that the ban will be ineffective in it's goal of reducing crime. Therefore banning is ineffective because banning is ineffective.""*

&gt;Fact is, law abiding citizens will and will continue to be attacked, mugged, killed by criminals who Use weapons that are impossible to own as law abiding civilians (see; pistol crime) or knifes, or simply be better fighters. Rather than expect us to either just hope we aren't killed, hope the criminal won't decide to kill or disable us but equip and train people to , when needed and if they want to , try and defend themselves.

&gt;It's not perfect, but allowing defenseless citizens to die and get fucked up because we don't trust ourselves isn't perfect either!

I have some news that just might rock your world gazzthompson: people much smarter than you (animals too) figured out the solution to this problem at *the dawn of time*. The perfect solution is to make each individual responsible for his or her own safety. Back when the first few animals came into existance (millions and millions of years ago, long before mamals evolved) a few of them realised that they would be safer from predators if they stuck together as a group. They were more successful because they lived as a *community* rather than in isolation. Many different species have this trait of living in groups, and there are many different hierarchies that exist. When humans first existed they lived in families and tribes. The young humans and weaker humans (sick adults or women in late pregnancy) were unable to defend themselves so it was left to the rest of the group to defend them. So we evolved from ""each individual being responsible for their own safety"" to ""each community being responsible for it's own safety"". I wont insult your intelligence any further and I will just skip to how those people that are responsible for protecting the community are known as the *police* in modern times. If you have a problem with crime then the best thing to do is demand a better police force (improved community) rather than demand new weapons for individuals (a step backwards from the success that teamwork brings).",0,1341317246,null,0,false,0,c58uitk,t3_vy2nw,t1_c58uitk,t1_c58u6m3,null,1429286308,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Well fuck me for using clear examples right?! I'm just pointing out that there are a lot of people who would commit violent crimes if they hadn't lost the genetic lottery; guns enable these people.

&gt;Even if the criminal is armed, criminals are shit at gun handling. They don't go down the range and shoot off 100 rounds at targets once a month, they don't take ""gun safety"" courses, which teach preparedness and stance. 

Oh never mind, it turns out you're full of crap too. I mean FFS is it *that* hard to imagine that a criminal would legally aquire a gun before using it illegally?

You've completely missed my point. Your example is just my TL;DR. Why would you bother bringing that up? Yes the granny is safer, but you've also put the other victim in a fuck tonne more danger! You've removed their advantage by giving criminals easy access to guns, so on average you've done fuck all to make the world a safer place.

There are statistics that can throw it either way, so I'm just not going to pay any attention to them (there are many many many factors that contribute to gun crime beyond just ""whether or not they are legal"") and instead focus on common sense: legalising guns is a step down the path of an arms race, and we *know* that arms races are a bad idea if you are aiming for safety/peace of mind.",0,1341318510,null,0,false,0,c58uo9e,t3_vy2nw,t1_c58uo9e,t1_c58ucp7,null,1429286378,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

All of the finales, barring 6, had good ideas, but when it came to the actual writing, most fell short, and over-compensated with dramatic music and reveals. Season 3 and 4 had a lot of focus on humanity's role in the Universe, and what our existence meant in full view of life, which is what makes good sci-fi, but Martha, despite being a fantastic character, was ruined by her unnecessary love for the Doctor, and the 'grand finale' of Season 4 was just plain bad.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;  Fortunately I don't need to use Google as I remember enough physics to be able to calculate the theoretical intensity of the received signals based on transmitter distance

As I said, you don't know enough and your reply is a brilliant example of why being able to put something into Google doesn't mean you'll get the right answer (not that I'm saying you did) 

You are working the figures which would give you a correct answer for a receiver using an omnidirectional antenna with no gain polarised the same as the transmitter. You are not factoring in the fact that TV antennas are yagis at least around 20-30dB of F/B (A 3 ele yagi has 20dB at least) and going on for 18dB of gain as an average. So you need to take your calculated signal strength from the 4G transmitter and reduce it by a factor of 100 to 1000 and take the received signal from the TV transmitter and increase it by a factor of 80 or so.

You're also not taking into account the signal polarisation. Once you get to VHF, polarisation makes a big difference. You can have someone transmitting horizontally polarised and someone receiving vertically polarised both on the same frequency and they'd not be able to hear each other. Virtually all TV antennas are horizontally polarised and all mobile phone tower antennas vertically polarised. The loss between horizontal and vertically polarised signals is another 20dB.

So there could be 50dB of attenuation in total which would mean the received signal from the 4G transmitter is around 100,000 times weaker than when being received by a correctly polarised omnidirectional no gain antenna.

&gt; I checked some rural areas which I know to be quite far from Sandy Heath and they would theoretically have as strong or stronger GSM reception.

...into an omnidirectional antenna with no gain and correctly polarised.

Redo the maths taking into account the factors I've shown above. The only time it wouldn't be taken into account is if the 4G transmitter was in the forward lobe of the azimuth pattern of the antenna and polarised the same as the antenna. Even if it were in the path, it is most likely the opposite polarisation and you need to reduce your end figure by a factor of 100 to take in the losses just due to polarisation.

If you really really want to get all pedantic about it, there's software available that will give you the topography between a transmitter and receiver and calculate losses for things like hills getting in the way.

Not having a go, merely pointing out that you cannot come to a conclusion based on the one part of the equation that you do know how to calculate and that you have to consider the whole system.",0,1341319496,null,0,1341320719,0,c58usv3,t3_vvxg6,t1_c58usv3,t1_c58dou8,null,1429286460,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I instantly became hooked. I started with the very first episode (""Rose"") of the new series. I've finished Doctor Who last month, as well as finishing Torchwood too. I'm re-watching the show in preparation for the new season and I'm toying with the idea of watching the old episodes too.

true,Mr_Wolfgang_Beard,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;Have you ever been attacked ? I have, and I called the police. But guess what, the criminal didn't give me the privilege of talking with the police on the phone whistle he attempted to brick me in the head. And the police turned up , 10 mins after it happened .

I'm sorry to hear that. However I still think that my theory (an effective police force) is better than yours (being armed with a gun). Imagine a parallel universe where you and me are on the other side of this argument, your story could have been something like this:

&gt;Have you ever been attacked? I have, and I *tried to use my gun to defend myself*. But guess what, the criminal didn't give me the privilage of *drawing my weapon* whilst he *shot me with his own gun*. And the police turned up, *a few hours* after it happened.

I don't *""live in this perfect world where everybody walks around in groups of hundreds and the police are everywhere and anywhere""* but my goal of ""protecting everybody with the police"" is better than your ""every man for himself"" IMO.

Ok I can see that you've edited your initial post so I'll just debate against that because I think that is at the core of our disagreement:

&gt;Edit: we can talk hypothetical situations and statistics all day, I simply think law abiding citizen should be able to reasonably equip themselves to adequately defend themselves and homes.

It is my belief that law abiding citizens should be safe in their own homes and in their own cities. Their property should be safe and their physical stature/means to afford weapons to defend themselves with/street knowledge shouldn't cause them to be an easier target for crime. This is the ideal world me an you both want. You think the best way to get there is by giving people easier access to weapons, but I've pointed out the flaws in an arms race. I think the best way is to have a police force, but you've pointed out that the police force isn't perfect either.

I think overall I will win this argument purely because there will always be people looking out for one another - that's what humans have evolved to do.",0,1341320643,null,0,false,0,c58uyp9,t3_vy2nw,t1_c58uyp9,t1_c58ul7v,null,1435704322,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;We tried communism and various forms of socialism, but that just seemed to result in a gigantic state attempting (and failing) to micromanage absolutely everything. And at it's best, this idea of state control was never as flexible or agile as more liberal economic approaches, which is why the west got so far ahead of the Soviets during the cold war.

We've tried social democracy, and various flavours of authoritarian State capitalism with peripheral bits of socialism bolted on maybe, I'm not sure anyone has ever really taken the key first step, the sin qua non of socialism though - worker control of the means of production.  Not even in Russia after the revolution was this ever really achieved.  As for communism, that was only a dream, and even Lenin knew it could only ever be one in an unindustrialised country like Russia.  For the record, communism is a Stateless, classless society without money or markets.  We can debate if such a thing is achievable, but I don't think it's fair to say we tried it and it didn't work.  Lenin was supposedly waiting for revolutions in industrialised countries where communism could be achieved and could then ultimately be spread back to Russia, and of course, that was wishful thinking on his part.

OTOH, for all their flaws - and they had many - and all their crimes - and these have become legendary (and I don't mean fables!), the various ""Communist"" countries often achieved some quite incredible elements of social and economic progress that I don't think we should overlook for ideological reasons - don't throw the baby out with the bathwater as it were.  In many cases they turned nations barely out of feudalism, into partly industrialised nations very rapidly (at great, sometimes horrific human cost).  They introduced some social reforms much earlier than Western countries, and had fairly progressive elements like universal healthcare and free universal education, extensive social housing programmes etc..  There was a study conducted in the mid 2000s, by a severe critic of the USSR, which surveyed attitudes towards the old communist regime, and he found something over 70% regretted its demise.  There have also been studies looking at how many Russians have died as a result of its passing, and the numbers don't make for pretty reading.",0,1341321502,null,0,false,0,c58v3lm,t3_vyy5n,t1_c58v3lm,t1_c58ugmx,null,1429286591,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Integration doesn't mean assimilation. My best friend is Ukrainian, my girlfriend of 4 years is Finnish. My best friend's girlfriend is Estonian. I have plenty of other friends from across the EU, and I love that. They are all integrated, and they've all retained their native cultures while living in the UK. That is, they speak English, they understand British culture and add their own unique culture to it. They don't just hang around with others from their home countries, they dont only go to shops and hairdressers that serve them in their native languages, and they don't only work with other people who come from the same country. That's not multiculturalism, that's just converting a bit of land from say, Britain, into something else.

Multiculturalism means having many cultures, sure, but you can maintain your culture and integrate, as the vast majority of immigrants to this country do.

There's a difference between a country allowing people to retain their former culture, and allowing them to essentially turn a part of your country into little-whatever.",0,1341321984,null,0,false,0,c58v6j3,t3_vyvpe,t1_c58v6j3,t1_c58v3en,null,1429286634,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Multiculturalism is a body of thought in political philosophy about the proper way to respond to cultural and religious diversity. Mere toleration of group differences is said to fall short of treating members of minority groups as equal citizens; recognition and positive accommodation of group differences are required through “group-differentiated rights,” a term coined by Will Kymlicka (1995). Some group-differentiated rights are held by individual members of minority groups, as in the case of individuals who are **granted exemptions from generally applicable laws in virtue of their religious beliefs** or individuals who seek **language accommodations in schools or in voting**. Other group-differentiated rights are held by the group qua group rather by its members severally; such rights are properly called group rights, as in the case of indigenous groups and minority nations, who claim the right of self-determination. In the latter respect, multiculturalism is closely allied with nationalism.",0,1341323159,null,0,false,0,c58vdtm,t3_vyvpe,t1_c58vdtm,t1_c58v6j3,null,1429286725,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"As I mentioned before, polarisation plays a large part. Although the received signal would be amplified by the gain of the antenna, it would also be attenuated to around 100th of that by the fact its not polarised the same.

Say for example we measured the actual field strength of the signal at the location of the antenna and both the strength of the signal of the TV transmitter and 4G site was exactly the same, albeit different polarisations. The actual signal received from the 4G transmitter by the antenna would be 100th that of the TV transmitter. 

I don't think that would be enough to affect it. I can listen to a signal on FM and one that is just 6dB (or 4 times) stronger will completely obliterate the weaker one to the point it is as if it were no longer there. In our case the wanted signal would be 100 times stronger than the unwanted one.  As I mentioned in an earlier post, I can run 400W on UHF into a vertical antenna about 10ft from the horizontal TV one transmitting around 50MHz lower than the MUX BBC is on and notice no loss of TV signal. 

There is hardly anywhere in the UK where there isn't enough space in the frequencies allocated for the 47 TV channels to allow at least a 50MHz split from the Freeview MUXs to allow 4G to be used. I'd love to know how they intend to manage it though because there's about 400MHz that the UK TV channels (21-68) occupy and when it comes to transmitting you cannot design an antenna that covers that range without being very inefficient which is the last thing you want in a mobile phone.",0,1341324590,null,0,1341325007,0,c58vnee,t3_vvxg6,t1_c58vnee,t1_c58uv24,null,1429286841,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Any flat that's half decent and reasonably priced will go very very fast. I moved recently and I was looking at a studio flat which had 6 people viewing it on the first day of viewings. For a temporary arrangement there are expensiveish weekly rented appartments - Lucy Properties has a few in Jericho, for example. Otherwise dailyinfo.co.uk has a lot of rooms to rent.

For the kind of thing you are describing, I'd subscribe to the rightmove.co.uk rss feed for oxford and be ready to pounce. Pretty much everyone advertises on there, with the possible exception of Lucy Properties (who are worth looking into as they have a lot of big apartment complexes in Jericho).

For internet, the things you should look at are either:

1. Can you get virgin cable. Not all places are wired up for cable so it's worth a search. (virgin media's website can tell you this based on a postcode)
1. Can you get FTTC (fibre to the cabinet). This is a new ADSL expansion that gives very good speeds and it's starting to get coverage in oxford. (BT's website can tell you this when searching about their 'infinity' product).

There's far more furnished (or partly furnished) places around. I prefer unfurnished but the nearest IKEA is a good 45min drive at least. You can order from IKEA online but they only send the big stuff, it's pricey and you have to book the order weeks in advance.

Expect to be paying in the order of £750+ for a modern 1bed apartment before bills (oxford is very expensive). The ad should give the council tax band, look up the price for that on the oxford council website because that will be £100+ a month.

Improve the police force. Have more patrols and regular routes so that response time is faster. This discussion is really about removing the advantage that criminals might gain by breaking the rules.

This is a dangerous gamble because it removes the threat of extreme violence from *criminals* to *everybody*. You are not actively improving anything and you are just hoping that the whole thing will sort itself out.

As I have pointed out a few times: arms races solve nothing. You only up the ante and hope it doesn't get worse. What if crime doesn't drop? What is your next plan? ""*Crime is still increasing, and law abiding citizens are at a disadvantage to criminals because they are forced to conceal their guns. We are removing the Concealed Carry laws so that citizens can display that they are armed and therefore become less of a target. We hope that this will reduce crime.*"" something like that should sound terrifying and bloody stupid. I don't want to live in a place where I can see chavs walking down the road with a mobile phone in one hand and a pistol in the other because ""people who would attack them have the upper hand if the chav doesn't have immediate access to his weapon""; it would never work.

[Inb4 some smart arse tells me ""That is a strawman argument!"" I am well aware of the [strawman fallacy](http://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/strawman). What I am attempting to point out is that gazzthompson is arguing that the best solution is ""an escalation in potential violence as a deterrent"", and the justifications for legalising guns are just the same as the justifications for legalising Open Carry laws.]

Ultimately the best that your plan could hope for is a better stalemate, crime will not disappear just because everybody is armed. If crime *does* drop then you can only really say ""This has turned out better than expected.""

My plan is tightening the grip on illegal activity. The police force can be better - and for the record it is pretty fucking good, we all know that the UK is nothing like the reality that occurs when the police force is ineffective.

My counter to your proposal is ""At best you are hoping that we will have a Cold War stand off where we pray that nobody pulls the trigger. It will not change much.""

Your counter to my proposal is ""The police force will never be flawless and perfect. There will always be ways to slip between the cracks. It will be really hard (but not impossible) to create the change that you are talking about."" - - - Well all I can say to that is ""Nothing comes for free."" It might not be as easy and cheap as your option but it is safer and more effective.",0,1341325378,null,0,1341325688,0,c58vsyy,t3_vy2nw,t1_c58vsyy,t1_c58v565,null,1429286915,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

However, to say it is 'chump change' ignores the fact that it is equivalent to, for example, spending on fire-protection services across Tyne and Wear, Merseyside and Humberside which is being told they have to make cuts of 9 million. Fire-fighting services face job cuts of up to 1500 across the board due to cuts they have to make. No increase in expenditure there. 

Also, 33 million is only part of the expense. The total figure is disputed, but as mentioned in article may be over 200 million.

However, this is really by the by. The main point is that almost every other department is having to make cuts and according to the article Sir Alan Reid:

 ""When the chancellor of the exchequer announced his plans for public expenditure to reduce by 25% in real terms over a four-year period, the Queen was very keen that the Royal Household should play its part in reducing its expenditure accordingly.

Yet, far from costs being reduced they actually rose.

Replace the y axis with crime and you will see a rough graph of how crime increases with your plan.

1. points to the crime rate at a point when guns didn't exist. Crime rate is steadily increasing as per usual.

2. points to the time period where guns were invented and given to soldiers/police. They could enforce laws better because they had the upper hand on criminals who did not have access to guns. Crime rate stopped increasing

3. points to the time period we are in where criminals can get hold of guns (if they try really hard). Crime rate increases again just like before guns were invented.

4. is the time when guns are legalised to let citizens protect themselves. Again, the new equilibrium prevents crime rates from increaing and a stalemate.

5. is the time in the future when criminals manage to gain the edge again (maybe they invent lazer pistols or something) and crime rate increases.

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"&gt;An additional problem is that when you're on benefits, and those benefits give you say, £3.50 an hour, and you apply for a job that gives you £5.50 an hour, the job is only really worth £2 an hour to you. Not much of an incentive to give up your free time.

And therein lies the entire problem with the attitude of people in the UK. Benefits are to tide you through the bad times, you are not being paid to do nothing.

The sooner you realise that, you'll see that the job offering you 5.50 an hour means you are 5.50 an hour better off, and some other poor cunt isn't down by 3.50 paying taxes for you to sit on your arse.

Whatever happened to ""an honest days work for an honest days pay"" ? Whatever happened to the pride of bringing home your wage packet, knowing that it was all due to your toil that your family could have nice things ?

The problem is, benefits have been too high for nigh on 25 years ... there's no incentive to work, because of people with your attitude who think about things in simplistic terms like ""they are only 2 quid better off"" ... you are better off (and the country as a whole is better off) because you are working for a living, and not expecting everyone else to finance your life while you do nothing.

No. Bigger people, violent people, and people with training in martial arts have an advantage over those who don't.

Full employment could be created very easily, force everyone to dig holes and fill them up again,everyone would have a job, but the outcome would not be very desirable. The same effect occurs when the government attempts to create employment artificially through taking peoples wealth and using it to fund programs due to [the calculation problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation_problem).

true,chuck_away,null,null,"&gt;Why would you choose to do that?

Well, a couple of reasons.  I originally did it because there were a few weeks at the start where I genuinely couldn't find six jobs to apply for. Rather than worry about having to explain myself, I just made few up.

After that, I realised that as they never checked, I might as well just make it up on the morning I signed on. Why go to the trouble of actually keeping record if they're not going to the trouble of trying to help me find work? No one ever asked me how an interview had gone or offered me any meaningful support or training. So fuck em.

&gt;We used the job centre to recruit recently and had a couple of calls regarding cvs and then interviews.

I think we're probably conflating two things here. If you advertised a job, and they found candidates for you, then I can see them checking those people turned up.

I can categorically guarantee you if you turned up to sign on tomorrow with a job search book filled in, no one would ever check you had applied for those jobs.

true,Saldejums_,null,null,"Uni accommodation is okay. You get a room and for the most part share bathroom/kitchen utilities. I lived in Darwin in my first year, and much later lived in Woolf.

My first year I was on campus, and I'm thankful for that. I was pretty shy, much like you, but by living on campus you are almost forced into interaction with others. 

This will sound bad, but for my first few days of university, the characters in Elderscrolls Oblivion were the total extent of my social interaction. I was shellshocked being away from  friends and family and wasn't sure what to do with myself.

The trick to getting socially involved, is to just get involved. It is tough if you don't put yourself out there though. Join some clubs, don't rule out bars just because you don't drink alcohol, just drink coke.

I've never personally liked clubs in general, but on some rare occasions I do have fun in them. Pubs however can be fun; they are more of a social scene as opposed to the 'meat market' you get at clubs. If you like quizzes, then try drag some people to a pub quiz. If you like live music, scout out a few places in town and pop along.

As I said initially, I started out in my room. I would sneak into the kitchen to cook whilst no one was there. I joined anime soc after a few days to get myself out of the room, as two people from my course went along to it too. Through that, I met more people whom I got into a fierce (friendly) pool rivelry with. That got me invited into inhouse funnymoney poker games. The people I ended up playing poker with turned into my best friends throughout my entire studies. We ended up playing video games, seeing films, visiting the beach and cooking together all the time.

So in answer to whether or not you'll hate university accommodation depends. I hate the accommodation office. But the rooms are okay, it's really convienient and forces social interaction a little more than if you live off campus.

Eastern European immigrants were willing to move and work in ways too many British people were not (this is pretty standard throughout the world as immigrants, and to a lesser extent well educated middle class people, are usually highly mobile while working class native communities are usually very immobile) they also happened to be better workers in low end jobs.

A nurse berating a person with injures that look like a drunken night out doesn't mean they weren't seen because of that.

Some of the following is probably a little off, the article isn't massively detailed, and i sense a little bit of ""scare"" journalism. I'm also not interested enough to do a massive amount of reading round. So please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

Currently if I make a picture you like, and you want to use it, you can  contact me to make an arrangement to licence it. If you can't contact me you can either not use it, or use it without permission. If you do, then i don't get paid, or if I find out about it I can follow it up and strike a deal or tell you to stop using it. Right? Of course you can skip the trying to get hold of me if you are morally broke, (like the daily mail did to a friend of mine, when they published his photo without credit or payment - even though they could've easily got hold of him).

With this in play it strikes me that I make a picture, you want to use it, you pay a third party who then may or may not track me down, and then may give me some, but not all of the money you've paid. If they don't manage to track me down, you've essentially paid someone else for my work. You're out of pocket (but do have a legal licence) and I get bugger all, or at the most a portion of the ""market rate"" after the third party has taken a slice. The third party pockets my money.

But it does strike me that in order to allow legal use of ""orphan works"", this is talking about taking a bunch of control from those who create the work. 

You say that it allows copyrighted content to be reused and paid for, in the case that the holder can't be traced, but if you are paying someone who has nothing to do with the creator, it seems like you are paying the wrong person, just to have someone to pay.
If you can't reach me you can't licence my work. No-one else should have the right to decide that you can reuse it on my behalf (unless i have instructed them so). And they certainly shouldn't have the right to any money you've paid for it. If you can't reach me, tough luck you can't use it.

There was only one entry.

From the Samaritans.

Anyway, your choices have pretty well been  covered:

* ADSL over a BT line
* ADSL over a non-BT line
* Cable
* 3G

If you are really only doing email, do seriously consider 3G, but ask your phone company about the best tariff.

For ADSL over a non-BT line, the phrase to search on is LLU or Local Loop Unbundling. There are several suppliers who will do a phone and ADSL package, but avoid TalkTalk as customers tend to hate it.

For ADSL over BT, your best approach might be Andrews and Arnold as they seem to be willing to put the hard word on BT. They can also do ADSL over a Be line (LLU). A bit more expensive than BT, and perhaps more than you want to pay for just email, but I like them.

We'll come out of recession at some point, hopefully by the time I'm qualified to sign my own work off, things will have picked up.  I'm interested in green energy so ultimately would like to get in the industrial side of things rather than domestic properties.  Although I think green energy will still grow in the domestic setting.

I don't want to be working on domestic building sites for the rest of my life.  

The 2330 is just a step towards higher qualifications and allowed me to see if it's something that interested me.  I know I enjoy manual work, so I needed one of the higher paying trades unless I want to move bricks around all day.  I hope there's more chance of growth down this path.

I'll be speaking with a follow I know who works in power stations after he told me to come see him once this course was over.

All the above plus, nothing else really interests me.   I could have gone down the IT route, but while I love computers and have worked in the field before, the day to day stuff bored me to drink.   It was like enjoying fixing cars as a hobby, then doing MOT work day in day out.

So basically, more money wasted and more lives ruined because of prohibition. 

It's a war they can't win, because people like getting high.  The reason people like getting high, because it feels good.

Responsible drug users far outweigh the problematic ones.  These are the people that need targeting, but you don't help people with a drug problem by criminalising them and ruining their and other responsible users lives with criminal records / prison sentences.

Just like millions of people can enjoy the nations favourite drug, alcohol.  Which has been shown to be considerably more harmful than many other illegal drugs.  Abusers can get help without the fear of being criminalised.

Decriminalise most drugs and legalise others.  Use the tax money to treat / deal with the people that abuse substances or run amock while one them, just like the morons that get plastered every friday / saturday night.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;  they pretend to compete while they use the exact same equipment in the local exchanges.

Because the competition is not there. The competition is in the network that connects to that equipment in the exchange, as well as the price and services offered. The UK has many tens of ISPs. It would be financially and practically impossible for them all to install their own equipment and it's a massive waste too. So BT and a few others choose to run the equipment and sell access to others. Really, only BT, TalkTalk and Sky even manage do to that right - since they're the ones with equipment in the most exchanges.

With BT, anyone can get service through hundreds of ISPs. If we had to rely on every ISP installing their own kit, no one would be able to sign up. Zen is an example of an ISP that fluttered with LLU for a while. They put their kit in precisely four exchanges. With BT they get national reach with minimal effort and not that much money, otherwise you'd only be able to have them if you lived in Oldham.

&gt; The UK government have been privatising the phone system over the last 20-30 years, resulting in the mess today. This success, like the success of privatized gas, electricity, buses and railways, is likely why they are presently privatizing the NHS and the police as we speak. ಠ_ಠ

BT is actually one of the few privatisations (with liberalisation) that worked. BT drastically modernised the outdated network it got from the GPO, we have plenty of competition today, prices are lower and there's no waiting list for a phone line.

true,ben9345,english,London,"Well, over in /r/europe I had a little lecture by someone who, I guess, is a member of UKIP or something because he pretty much towed the party line to a tee, generally that EU is a cancer that passes all sort of laws that makes no sense but importantly that the UK/English traditions that we can fall back on cover all the bases we would want and they do it better/they are the originals and the EU simply copies from us. He then also seemed to suggest that because we had (and I don't know where he got this from) a spotless human rights record and some countries used to be dictatorships, they have no right to be considered equal to us. Now I am sure you can see that if you want to hold the mistakes of the past over a nation's head and then compare human rights records, a combination of the British Empire and collaboration in the Iraq war and extraordinary rendition mean we come out very badly. 

The truth is our human rights law is hugely unsubstantial. We have no right to privacy except that granted from the ECHR (UKIP and Euro-sceptics usually get upset about terrorists having human rights and conflate the ECHR and the EU so I will too) and the majority of non-discrimination rules in the UK have their origins in regulations and directives from the EU. On human rights, the UK is the only country in the EU that broke the ECHR after 9/11 and after those measures proved useless at preventing terrorism in 2005 they were increased and rights were once again rolled back to be replaced by surveillance and extended police powers that were simply a political stunt by Tony Blair to look tough on terrorists. It only hinders ordinary citizens - for example some of the police powers were declared to breach the ECHR in 2010 but these powers were not being used on terrorism but to stop a protest against arms trading reducing the individual's rights in the UK. It is the European focus on fundamental rights (not rights that parliament can simply repeal as Labour did with a vast array of civil liberties in the 2000s) that is slowing the march to an Orwellian state. When we accept that some people are not imbued with at least a few ""inalienable rights"", as Jefferson put it, then we grant the government a magic wand to wave when they want to get rid of you. If they tell people you *might* be a terrorist they can do what they like and no-one will care. Every British citizen held in Guantanamo Bay has been released without charge. Think about what that means. That means 9 totally innocent men were kidnapped and held in a prison, by all accounts tortured then released when they realised they were innocent and the people that are getting upset at the Abu Qatada case and his deportation being blocked (because, suprise surprise, he has some minor rights, like that of a fair trial,) would give the UK the same rights to kidnap and detain without a word being said. They are so keen to give the government the right to deal with people they don't like but what will they say when they deal with someone they like? What happens when the plan backfires? [Thomas More explains this well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-nJR15e0F4&amp;feature=player_embedded)

[Most of the stories of laws that make no sense or laws that destroy English traditions are stories made up by British journalists for a laugh.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqVJEZnYiZo) One example is the EU passed a directive stating we must use the metric system. [The authority granted to British courts to rule on EU issues meant a divisional court could grant the right to retain the pint, the mile and to display pounds and ounces along side the metric equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoburn_v_Sunderland_City_Council#Judgment) because they recognised it was a tradition and the EU had no right to intrude so drastically. The EU never disagreed. 

While we are in the EU we are a stronger political force in the world and a stronger economic voice in the world. The EU is the biggest economic area in the world 2 trillion dollars bigger than the US. The EU last year decided to charge US airlines for the carbon emissions they dumped over our countries. Hillary Clinton had an aneurysm and threatened ""appropriate action"" if the EU didn't allow the US to go tax free. The ECJ disagreed and the US shut up. There has been no reaction and all the US airlines have paid because the EU is too great a force to [simply bully like they do with individual countries.](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/12/not-so-gentle-persuasion-us-bullies-spain-proposed). Does anyone honestly think David Cameron is going to be forceful and push the British people's concerns on the US government or is it more likely we will be bullied and charmed into accepting pathetic and unequal concessions the likes of which the [US-UK extradition treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition_Act_2003) (yet another failure of human rights legislation in the UK) is but one example. 

I'm sorry this kind of became an essay but I tend to ramble like that. I don't deny that the EU has problems. Its undemocratic and too focused on economics for my liking but that is not a reason to abandon years of integration and co-operation. The EU could be really successful as long as people focus on the positives and aim to be helpful and constructive and not be so arrogant to suggest that their country is superior to any combination of others: we would be tainted by their mere presence. It smack of the worst kind of ignorant nationalism that xenophobic far-right groups are so keen on.

I heard again this pitch about mandatory landline and qualifying 10 calls per month that I am supposed to place at a certain hour on certain days to particular area codes. If I fail to do so, it's a £5.18 monthly charge on top of the landline regular monthly charge. They basically will charge me for not using the phone that I don't need and don't want to have at the first place. 

It's not even that specific. It's 10 chargeable calls per month/quarter, or something like that. In exchange for that they make caller ID free. It's not great, but it isn't what you make it either.

&gt;  I called BT, and was told that they did not have to come to the property to reactivate the landline, it will be activated by the midnight, and that I have to call the next day to place a new order for the broadband. 

BT doesn't necessarily have to visit to activate the landline. If the wiring is all in place as you say it is, it is rather trivial for them to do it. 

Did they say why the order failed? If it's a new flat, could it be that they don't think it (the address) exists yet?",0,1341344191,null,0,false,0,c590fzj,t3_vzas5,t1_c590fzj,t3_vzas5,null,1429289166,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Bingo. It's never going to be genuine competition, all it is is reselling and re-branding. Each layer takes it's profit and ultimately the cost is more for the consumer.

You completely missed my point. They're not reselling and re-branding because it's not the same service from 100 different brands.

The various ISPs only buy access to the bits of BT's network that connect to their customers - they still run their own networks, their own customer service, their own billing systems, etc.

They aren't just taking BT's internet service and rebranding it as their own. There is actually a technical difference in the service you can buy from BT.com (as a normal consumer) and the service you can buy from other ISPs.

The price BT is allowed to charge for access to its network is tightly regulated. So I fail to see why you don't think it's genuine competition. It's probably cheaper for an ISP to buy access through BT/Sky/TalkTalk/C&amp;W/etc (BT isn't the only one to wholesale their network) than it is to attempt any sizeable rollout of their own equipment to a significant number of exchanges.

&gt; BT should not be offering services and maintaining the network, imho there should be a central non-profit that runs the wires and exchanges with companies dealing with them.

That's a separate argument. I'm not sure that a non-profit would eliminate all of the problems BT is perceived to have. They aren't suddenly going to splash the cash, they'd want the same public subsidies to roll out fibre.

The part of BT that deals with all this is already functionally and operationally separate from the other arms.",0,1341345241,null,0,false,0,c590pna,t3_vzas5,t1_c590pna,t1_c590mha,null,1429289297,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

* Fawlty Towers in ""The Fires of Pompeii"", when the Doctor is explaining Donna by saying, ""She's from Barcelona""

* Off-hand references to many reality TV shows in ""Bad Wolf"", but obviously the biggest were ""Big Brother"", ""Weakest Link"" and ""What Not to Wear"".

* The Queen's Christmas message: mainly not being able to see it, as referred to by Harriet Jones in ""The Christmas Invasion"" and Wilf's message from HRH is taken over by the lady in white in ""The End of Time""

* Countdown, another British show. Professor Docherty had a rambling bit about missing the show, though it wasn't the same since Des, either Des (Desii?) left.

* Blue Peter, a kid's show. I think that's the one you see making a space ship out of cake when a kid takes over the remote control in ""Aliens of London"" The Absorbaloff in ""Love and Monsters"" was the winning entry in a contest on that show for kids to create a Doctor Who alien.

* The Doctor told Rose he loved ""The Muppet Movie"" in ""Tooth and Claw"", seemed less a fan of Margaret Thatcher.

* Sideways reference in ""The Impossible Planet"" to one of the Brit soaps EastEnders. In response to something Ida Scott says, the Doctor tells her she's just jinxed it with the equivalent of saying something like, ""This is going to be the best Christmas Walford has ever had"". (She's bemused and asks if he's done)

I've never seen EastEnders, but apparently that's one of the worst things you could say on that show.

true,Evis03,cnty-uk,Welshman-on-Mersey,"Well, I'm not a union rep so all I can go on is what I've seen. The BMA have finally figured out that they're the ones who these changes actually target and are not happy. The other unions seem to have cooled their jets after the general strike last year. This may be for acceptance's sake or because they've realized that these changes will in fact leave a sizable portion of their members better off than the current 2008 section of the scheme. I don't know if this is genuine altruism on the government's part of if it's a clever 'divide and conquer' tactic.

I'll repeat this one more time as it's a complete lie that everyone is going to be worse off: The 2015 section will leave many workers better off. Here's how.

If you're in a job that doesn't have a career progression that means you are going up the banding, then you hit your maximum salary within about six or seven years (not allowing for yearly increases in actual band amounts, which are usually very small). This means that over a period of about 30-40 years (the bracket most people retire in), the lower paid years will not do much to offset the MEAN career average from the final salary. So they're not loosing out all that much in terms of the salary the pension will be calculated on.

Where the improvement comes in is the far better accrual rate. This is the fraction of that salary you get paid for each year and part year you have in your pension. So for example if you have an accrual rate of 1/60th with 20 years of membership at a final salary of 25,000 pounds, it's 20x1/60x25000=£8,333 per year. This is what someone would get under the 2008 section of the scheme

Let's say that this same person has a career average of about £23,000. With the 1/54th accrual rate proposed for the 2015 section we get a yearly pension of £8,518. Despite being based on a lower salary, the member is better off.

Now, doctors despite their reputation for massive paycheques start out in the first years earning very little (at least compared to what they get at the end of their working lives). This big difference between starting pay and finishing pay means that their career average is far lower than their final salaries compared to people who have just stuck in one job. This means moving from a final salary to career average based scheme leaves them considerably worse off, even with the better accrual rate.

Managers and administrative staff along with specialist clinical workers are also likely to be more effected as they have a greater tendency to apply for vacancies that will take them up into higher pay brackets over the course of their careers, thus leading to a greater gap between final salary and career average.",0,1341352748,null,0,false,0,c592kp3,t3_vv0my,t1_c592kp3,t1_c590fx4,null,1429290173,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

He looks for a couple of job vacancies and just writes them in his job diary, he never actually applies for anything. He has been at Ingeus for just over a year now seeing an advisor at least once a week. In fact, as of 2 months ago he has been seeing 2 advisors, with the second one being a special advisor that works with people at least twice a week himself.

So he's attending Ingeus 2 times a week at minimum, and the job centre once a fortnight, and he has only applied for about 4 actual jobs this year.

Yep, British Rail wasn't great, although I don't think that everything's gone downhill since privatisation. There have been some improvements, although there probbaly would have been more in the hands of a  central organisation - a kind of improved British Rail .  

One problem is that the number of passengers has risen more than expected. The other is that to a certain extent investment in the railways has been restricted by the franchise system - a train company won't invest much if they know they might lose it all in 3 years time. 

Under Labour the duration of franchises got longer and those in a particular area got merged. This did improve things in a way because the franchises left had a bigger area and longer periods in business so had more incentive to invest.

I actually admire Farage for not wavering when people called him a crackpot for suggesting the collapse of the Euro which he also detailed quite accurately before it went down. I love his speeches as well. He's got a bit of passion in him and believes what he says.

true,JimmyNic,null,null,"Very interesting post. I'm generally of the opinion that we should leave the EU, but in light of your response it looks like I'll have to do some more research.

Regarding rights, I understand that England has a tradition that all activities are legal unless otherwise stated. Of course you can contrast this with the very hierarchical/authoritarian societies we used to run, but this is an important point as far as rights stand - it means that your rights are protected so long as no laws are made that infringe upon them. I believe this is in contrast to other European nations, though I am not sure. 

Regarding political clout I have to concede Britain is weaker than the EU, though if our political ambitions in the EU are not represented I don't see what advantage this would give us. There is much to regret in our relationship to the US, though I think we must accept that we are no longer a leading nation and must end up bending the knee to stronger ones. Politically we are further right than much of Europe, and if our interests are better served through closer ties with them then it makes little sense to pretend otherwise.

I think it's also worth saying that the EU was intended to be a federation of sorts, and there are plenty of people within the EU who still wish it to be. Pretending that it is merely a trade agreement that we can profit from is dishonest, and is likely to get us burned at some point. Though much of the right's portrayal of the EU is overblown the stealthy method by which its principal members are trying to form a superstate is accurate to some extent. 

If the EU were merely a trading agreement I don't think I'd have as much of a problem with it, but I don't believe a political union of Europe is a good idea - mostly because of the disparity between the people's of Europe in terms of culture, economy, traditions etc. Certainly we could not have a federation similar to the USA.

1. He cannot be depended on in any scenario or circumstance where he is not located in. All Super Heroes exist and have an area under their constant supervision. He's pretty much a Guardian Angel

2. He does not fight Crime on a daily basis. He stops crisis(plural?) that could cause the destruction of all life on planets, time, and/or space. So he's on a much different level than your stereotypical Hero.

3. He is constantly traveling through time and space. (sort of like point 1 but a little more clear)

4. His personality isn't that of someone with a mission or crusade. Typically Super Heroes have a one set mind about things. He's just out there having fun and when bad stuff appears he takes care of it, like a Doctor.

The problem with BT in London and indeed many places is that they don't actually have automated systems. They can't just tell a server to connect you, they have to physically go to a cabinet and hook you up to the fibre connection.

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"&gt; I don't work for the country, and anybody who does is a weak-minded fool. I work for my own personal gain, and because furthering my own aims and goals, like ensuring the prosperity of my family, is far more important to me than promoting Marxist socio-economic equality.

Indeed, if that were the case, you'd have set some money by to deal with the hard times. Instead, the second you are unemployed, you have you hand out expecting someone else to support you. Capitalist when you're working, Socialist when you're unemployed ? That kind of thing ?

You know, I left UK in 1995 for exactly this reason.

I started work in 1985 (finished high school, started an apprenticeship), and got stuck in a rut for the next 8 years. During that time I was able to save exactly 0 quid, I lived in a pokey one room rented bedsit with shared bathroom, and after paying my poll tax, food, electric, insurance and petrol for my moped, I maybe had 40 quid a month left over for ""luxuries"" like clothes and the occasional monthly pint. My wages weren't exactly poor either, but the cost of living meant I was always living month-to-month paycheck to paycheck.

8 fucking years I lived like this. All the while my younger brother was unemployed. He had 2 kids of his own and married a girl with 3, then they had 2 more together, for a grand total of 7 kids. Neither of them ""worked"" officially, but both had sidelines like catalogue sales and windowcleaning etc. They lived in a 4 bedroom detached house, and could afford to run a car and were living the sweet life, all at the taxpayer's (essentially MY expense).

That made me realise the inequality in the system, and unfortunately taught me to resent ""doleys"". Is it any wonder the mentality of ""I'm only X quid a week better off working"" has prevailed ? Benefits should tide you over, and nothing more - it shouldn't be more luxurious to sit doing nothing than to be working.

As I said, benefits have been too high for 25 years, and it's bred a culture of entitlement and laziness that frankly makes me sick.

I now live in South East Asia, where there is NO welfare state whatsoever, if you don't work, you don't eat, simple as that. But it's a damn eye opener I tell you, because everyone looks after their own, there is a massive amount of community spirit and everyone I know would sell the shirt off their own back to help you out if you fall on hard times.

Even the poorest of the poor will FIND something to do, be it collecting old newspapers or plastic bottles to resell and make a wage. The incentive to work is there, because there is no fallback. But I swear I'm happier here than I ever was in UK.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I disagree (didn't downvote, though). He's one of the few to have truly competed at the top level in the squad, his experience will be invaluable to our younger players. He's never depended on athleticism, so his age won't be a hindrance, and honestly, there are no available advanced playmakers like Rafa that are available and an improvement on him as soon as they step on to the pitch.  No offense, but Defoe and Van der Vaart may play in similar areas of the pitch, but their contributions are about as different as King's is to Modric's. Defoe is there to do nothing but score goals. The day I see him pick out an incisive pass instead of shooting from a ridiculous angle 22 yards out is the day I get Wenger's name tattooed on my taint. Rafa played almost as a second striker for us under 'arry because that's what his system demanded, but in a midfield three, he could play more as a trequartista, while still giving us the option of him making late runs into the box. That and he's practically talismanic for us. He's by far one of our most visible and well-recognized players internationally, and he's the most vocal about how much he enjoys living in London and playing for Spurs. If we lost him I'd be crushed.

I think Sigurdsson is being bought to slowly work his way into Rafa's role. Obviously he's getting older and isn't capable of playing 90 minutes week in and week out. Gylfi will allow him some rest, while learning under him, and from what I've seen is fairly adept at playing out on the wing in an advanced role too, if need be. But Rafa will be starting, I hope. He's one of the few players we have that can create something out of nothing and get us goals when we need them (perfect example: volley against Liverpool at Anfield last year).",0,1341375821,null,0,false,0,c5979tf,t3_w06wy,t1_c5979tf,t1_c594dlt,null,1429292452,14,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,14

&gt;Guns not freely available

The handgun ban has done almost nothing to lower gun crime. Banning things doesn't stop criminals it just criminalises law abiding citizens and drives the criminals underground. For example, Cannabis is illegal in the UK yet you can buy it on every street corner, even in the most remote of places.

&gt;We get much longer holidays

This is only a relatively minor thing. There are quite a few nonsensical employment laws that we could do without. I don't actually know, but I'm assuming they don't have paid male paternity leave over there.

&gt;In the vicinity of a multi-cultured continent

So is the US. Mexico, Peru and Jamaica are as interesting as Greece, Spain and Malta. That said, immigrants and state multiculturalism is a major problem.

&gt;Doesn't take long to go from one side of the country to the other

Th lack of space coupled with the rapidly increasing population is a massive disadvantage. People in North America and Australia have much larger houses and more land, on average, than their British counterparts. And thanks to the jet engine, one of many great British inventions, you can actually travel across continents in a few hours. It's not like you have to drive from Oregon to Maine.

Contrary to popular belief Americans do actually have healthcare and there are programmes to help the disadvantaged.

true,Feint1,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,"&gt;Guns are incredibly hard to come by here, of course gun crime is lower.

Illegal guns can be found and purchased in any town fairly easily. Legal guns are what are hard to get hold of.

&gt;Firearm homicide rates are less than a third than those of the USA http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_the_United_Kingdom#Firearms_crime

You're comparing the situation here to a country which is not even remotely similar. You could compare us to Kosovo or Mexico if you wanted, that would make for an equally ridiculous argument.

Gun crime in this country is currently higher than it was in 1998, that ban has done nothing to lower crime rates. There's also the problem of a increase in burglaries and violent attacks on people within their own homes. Many firearms are even illegal for sport, which is really unfair on the people who do not commit crime but like to own guns for sport.

Vehicle homicide is a massive problem, would you advocate a ban on motor vehicles?

&gt;For your other points, I'm an employer and I'm bloody glad we have fair employment laws. In the USA you're left high and dry.

They're not fair in the slightest. Regulation has gone beyond simply being fair to employees. The proposed quote on female boardroom members is an example of the extremes we're heading to. It's not the state's job to coddle everyone, they're not your nanny.

&gt;European culture and history is much more varied than North America and environs. 

Subjective. Asia is probably the most varied region of the world in my opinion, I wouldn't use this as a motive to live in North Korea however.

&gt;The US is definitely bigger, sure, but this goes both ways - it's nice to get a train to another country in a couple of hours! 

You can get a plane to another country in a couple of hours anywhere.

&gt;Also our NHS is much more comprehensive than Medicare, and you don't need private health insurance. 

You aren't forced to use a single service in the US. I personally don't like paying national insurance. Bupa healthcare and a private pension would probably cost me less than what the government takes from me. It seems to me like the only people who benefit are those who don't work and save.

Speeding drivers should be caught and given fines, I admit the waste of energy put into drug users is retarded, but that is purely a political problem, where politicians implement and sustain policies which have a negative effect to society, speeding on the other hand has a negative effect on society, because people get killed due to dangerous driving. Of course drug abusers cause harm too, but these are generally isolated as medical problems, not arrogance. 

The cuts in my opinion are bad, because what is going to happen instead, is people will be employed by the job centre (for no wage) or demand volunteers to take on a job which should be waged and give someone a reasonable living.

To qualify for Ordinary Paternity Leave you must be an employee. You must be taking the time off to support the mother or carer for the baby and intend to be fully involved in their upbringing. Rights to Ordinary Paternity Leave are extra to your normal holiday allowance.

To qualify for Ordinary Paternity Leave, you must have been with your employer for at least 26 weeks by either:

    the end of the 15th week before the start of the week when the baby is due
    the end of the week you are notified you are matched with your child

You must also be either the:

    biological father of the child
    mother's husband or partner (including same-sex relationships)
    child's adopter 
    husband or partner (including same-sex relationships) of the child's adopter

If you are a worker you will not qualify for Ordinary Paternity Leave but may qualify for Ordinary Statutory Paternity Pay.

If you are an agency worker, office holder or subcontractor, you will not normally have the right to Ordinary Paternity Leave.

You most likely are integrated. Integration doesn't mean being friends with your neighbours and taking part in the neighbourhood watch, it means adapting to the basic fundamental social and cultural norms of a country.

&gt;For many, wanting to be with their own people is a perfectly normal desire.

Right, I just think it's awful to move to a foreign country if that's what you want.

&gt;How often do we see English folk move to Spain and become part of an English community there, who all live in the same area, socialise together, don't bother to learn the language, etc? Should they be turfed out of the country?

Probably not, but I wouldn't cry if they were. I think it's awful that you have entire groups of people moving to Spain, living there for 30-40 years of retirement, always refusing to eat Spanish food, to learn even basic spanish, to adapt in the slightest. They don't want to live in Spain, they want to live in England with sunshine. That's terrible, and I couldn't blame the Spaniards at all for not wanting that.

&gt;I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just concerned that you seem to be suggesting we should dictate to people who they should and shouldn't mix with.

Not in the slighest, I just don't think it's acceptable to move to a country for life and then not adapt to that country at all - there are so many generally older immigrants who moved here in the 60's and 70's who **still** can't speak English. It's absurd, and awful, that people would live in the UK for 40 years and not learn the language - without it, they're not *really* living in Britain, they're living in a tiny outpost of say Pakistan or Bangladesh, or China. I don't think that's good for them, and I don't think that's fair on the citizens of any country.

Source?

&gt;You're comparing the situation here to a country which is not even remotely similar. 

No, he's illustrating the difference between easily-available guns that people are all but encouraged to own and hardly any guns at all.

&gt;Gun crime in this country is currently higher than it was in 1998

But still a lot, lot lower than the US rate.

&gt;There's also the problem of a increase in burglaries and violent attacks on people within their own homes.

And yet [overall crime has gone down](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9213885/Street-theft-sees-largest-rise-for-a-decade-crime-figures-show.html)

&gt;Vehicle homicide is a massive problem, would you advocate a ban on motor vehicles?

You're suggesting that guns have just as many uses as cars?

&gt;They're not fair in the slightest. 

Blanket statement. Are you suggesting they are in no way more fair than those in the USA?

&gt;Regulation has gone beyond simply being fair to employees. The proposed quote on female boardroom members is an example of the extremes we're heading to.

Ermm...isn't that in the name of being fair to female employees? Not sure how that counts as an 'extreme'.

&gt;Subjective. Asia is probably the most varied region of the world 

Why bring in other territories? It doesn't invalidate his point.

&gt;You can get a plane to another country in a couple of hours anywhere.

At no extra cost? And are planes now just as convenient? Otherwise, why point this out? And that's before we get to the TSA.

&gt;You aren't forced to use a single service in the US.

You're not forced to use a single service in the UK.

&gt;I personally don't like paying national insurance.

Yeah, healthcare for all, what a silly idea.

&gt;Bupa healthcare and a private pension would probably cost me less than what the government takes from me.

No, they wouldn't. In either case.

&gt;It seems to me like the only people who benefit are those who don't work and save. 

It seems to me like some people will always complain.

&gt;The welfare state is a mess in this country.

But lots, lots better than what's offered in the US - that's kind of the point.

Agreed.


&gt;the schools are still open, 

Albeit with many in a state of disrepair after the current government scrapped funding for new schools in Wigan and Bolton.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10585243


&gt;the libraries are still open, 

Except for the five that were closed, and the reduced opening hours..

http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1407488_libraries_shut_free_parking_bin_collections_hit__more_details_of_services_affected_by_cuts


&gt;my bins are still collected, 

Less frequently, see above.


&gt;the streets are still swept. 

Again, less frequently and some areas not at all. Overnight street cleaning for the centre on weekends has also been scrapped.

http://falseeconomy.org.uk/cuts/item/manchester-waste-collection-and-street-cleaning


&gt;The police are still here, 

Except for the 270 officers and 616 support staff laid off.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2011/jun/27/police-cuts-announced-greater-manchester-chief-constable


&gt;the fire service still works, 

For now - however lets see how it performs under periods of high demand with 40% fewer engines and 50% fewer firefighters.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-16591193


&gt;the ambulances are still driving around, 

With only 73% of emergency calls being met within the eight minute target *before* the cuts are implemented, things can only get worse.

http://mancunianmatters.co.uk/content/21101491-cuts-how-they-will-affect-greater-manchesters-emergency-services


&gt;the local hospital is as open as ever.

But is it staffed and funded properly? 1400 were laid off from the central Manc hospitals alone.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-11438449

You also neglected the fact that six walk in centres are shut or about to shut.

It depends on the situation. He *raped* a 5 year old, this is not normal behaviour. Porn does not lead do this sort of gross misconduct, just as playing COD doesn't make competent people walk into schools with guns and start shooting students.  
  
Therefore, I highly suspect (for obvious reasons, nobody knows the details of this case) that either the child was mistreated in some way - be it neglect, or any form of abuse, I am not referring solely to sexual abuse - *or* the child has serious issues. Although it *could* be all down to the teenager's mind being warped by the internet, I find it hard to believe that all blame can be put on him watching porn.  
  
Therefore, what ever lead this 14 year old (now 15) to do such a horrible thing must be addressed, be it his parents, or himself. Yes, porn should be harder to reach for teens, but not impossible. Children *will* explore themselves sexually, and parents should discuss this with with the child - it's far healthier than repressing them, and teaches them what is normal.  
  
If not, we are pretty much saying that everybody is a product of society and nothing more. Whilst this is partially true, claiming that this is the only cause of a person's behaviour leads to complications. How can we say that *any* criminal is responsible for their crimes if they're a product of society? How can we justify incarcerating *anyone*? (I would just like to add that I do believe that a lot of empathy should be used in these cases, competent people born into horrible circumstances that lead them to do something ""bad"" should be helped, but this does not take away from the fact that they did something wrong.)

&gt;Integration doesn't mean being friends with your neighbours and taking part in the neighbourhood watch, it means adapting to the basic fundamental social and cultural norms of a country.

I'm not sure what you mean by that.  How do I, for instance, display fundamental social and cultural norms?  I make sure I put my rubbish out on the morning of the collection so that it doesn't get torn apart by foxes and scattered all over the street, but that's about the end of my interaction.  Other than that, I do everything in the privacy of my home, I don't bother anyone and they don't bother me.  If someone from, say, Bangladesh wants to do the same, then I don't see what the issue is if they're not hurting anyone.

&gt;I think it's awful that you have entire groups of people moving to Spain, living there for 30-40 years of retirement, always refusing to eat Spanish food, to learn even basic spanish, to adapt in the slightest

I couldn't agree more.  Personally, I'd love to live in Spain and the first thing I'd do before I even moved over there would be to learn the language.  I'd be delighted to eat Spanish food (hell, I cook a few Spanish dishes already).  For me, it would be about adapting to their culture instead of trying to force my own upon them.  But, and this is my point, that's MY choice.  If someone else decides to go over there to live, spends all day in the local English-style pub and doesn't speak a word of the language, that's their choice.  I don't think it's right to stop them from doing that.

Same thing over here.  If someone wants to move to England, not learn the language and simply be part of their own small community, that's up to them.  I think it's a shame because they're missing out on a lot of interaction and enjoyment, but you pays your money, you takes your choice.

I think, after all this, that you and I seem to be broadly in agreement on some of these issues.  Ultimately, yes, it'd be nice for them if they integrated, but we can't force them.",0,1341409381,null,0,false,0,c59bdj0,t3_vyvpe,t1_c59bdj0,t1_c59abs6,null,1429294383,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The Prius may give you twice the MPG of an old pick up, but then 100 times more energy was used to make it's batteries than went into the who 70s pickup and 1000 times more lithium.  Now I am not crazy enough to say it is worse than the old car over a lifetime like some have tried to claim, I am just making the point that they are no where near as clean as people might think.  Add to that that all that saved oil does not really get saved.  It gets burnt doing other things instead.  That is nature of the problem.  Save a kWh here, but only at the cost of 0.95kWh over there and a ton of some other finite resource, or save some resources over there but waste a lot of energy doing it.  You get what I mean?

If the third world today used energy at the rate we do in the west it would be the same as there being 72bn people on earth ([Ref](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/opinion/02diamond.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all)).  They are eventually going to catch up and that is where we are heading.  So you have to ask, how long do you expect it to take technology to make us 10 times more efficient than we are now?  If we assume technology makes us grow at 5%pa, it will take 47 years for us just to bring the third world up to our standards without increasing consumption.

Zero growth for a generation just to stand still, and that is assuming a very healthy tech based growth rate.  Is it realistic to think that because it took us 100 years to master steam power or 50 to master petrochemicals it will only take us another 50 to master the next great thing?

Sales recruitment is a harsh, unpleasant load of 'flesh peddling' and you'll be roundly hated by everyone you deal with - and you'll end up hating yourself.

Recruitment sucks big balls - certainly don't move to London on the basis of a  'graduate management' position. You'll be cold-calling like a bastard and treated like a chimpanzee, and everyone you speak to will loathe what you represent, and by extension, you.

If you don't perform after three to six months they will chuck you out on your ear. 'Graduate Management' my arse - you'll be in the 'Academy' where two out of ten last six months. Don't.do.it.

Quals to judge - BSc.(Hons) who went into science and tech recruitment from Uni. Lasted four years. Fuck. Whole industry riddled with cunts. Worst of the lot is sales recruitment.

When they come after you to hijack your car, or to access your house, they are not going to come only with a hand gun.  So most times your chances of surviving are better if you do not take out your weapon.  


Carrying a gun does not always give you much of a chance to defend your self against a AK47 or other automatic.  Its not like the movies.  You dont have time to respond or take out the knife or gun.  And sometimes they come for you for the gun.

I'm not saying it's a bad two parter, but it was the first time that a series story arc actually took over an episode and that grated with me. It seemed like a cheap way out because Moffat wrote himself into a corner.

He may have said that, but he didn't know that and he most certainly couldn't use the screwdriver whilst he was restrained, he just appeared and we were supposed to accept that he came up with a magical solution as an audience. I personally still don't. 

How did his 'future self' get out in the first place to give Rory the screwdriver? 

There is a difference, but I would say since RTD left the quality of Moffats writing has decreased dramatically, I honestly wasn't sure how The Doctor would get out of the whole library conundrum and when it all came together I went 'oooh' and hit myself for not seeing it.

I don't actually keep citations to every piece of information I come across. But when you see that there is a lot of gun ownership among gangs it's clear that acquiring them is not difficult.

&gt;No, he's illustrating the difference between easily-available guns that people are all but encouraged to own and hardly any guns at all.

But the US is a different country with a different culture. Before the handgun ban there was handgun ownership but far less gun crime.

&gt;And yet overall crime has gone down

In all of the areas completely unrelated to firearm ownership. More widespread firearm ownership could prevent many of the crimes that are increasing, muggings at knife point being an incredibly worrying one.

It's not even just handguns, under the law tasers and pepper spray are actually illegal.

&gt;You're suggesting that guns have just as many uses as cars?

Yes. Guns are used for sport, defence, display and as a tool. Just like with cars it takes the person using it to cause a crime. Statists always ban things they don't like without any proper thought.

&gt;Blanket statement. Are you suggesting they are in no way more fair than those in the USA?

I'm not an expert on US law, but It seems closer to what I would like here.

&gt;Ermm...isn't that in the name of being fair to female employees? Not sure how that counts as an 'extreme'.

It's illogical. Everyone who has a job in a board room got there on merit, only the best get to the top. So by legislating that 40% of the board must be women you're forcing men who've worked hard out of their jobs and have placed women who are not nearly as good in their place. No real feminist would support something so ridiculous.

&gt;Why bring in other territories? It doesn't invalidate his point.

Because you can't really say you like a country because it's close to another country, especially not in a world with aeroplanes. It was always a ridiculous thing to include.

&gt;At no extra cost? And are planes now just as convenient? Otherwise, why point this out? And that's before we get to the TSA.

It's cheaper to travel from Birmingham to Edinburgh by plane than it is by train and it takes less time, airport included.

&gt;You're not forced to use a single service in the UK.

I can opt out of paying national insurance now?

&gt;Yeah, healthcare for all, what a silly idea.

So as someone who tries to stay healthy, eats well, exercises and doesn't smoke, why should I pay for everyone else? Why should my taxes go to pay for obese people, smokers and people who injured themselves in a late night punch up? Why should I suffer worse care because of the rest of society?

I have to pay for house and car insurance, why not health insurance? It may seem harsh, but that's life. The state is not a nanny.

&gt;No, they wouldn't. In either case.

I'm not even a higher earner and I know I would have more money without the welfare state. I would have a better pension and healthcare as well.

&gt;It seems to me like some people will always complain.

It's called criticism, we don't have enough of it in many aspects of politics.

true,rablenkov,uk,Southend-on-Sea,"Here we go, folks.  Another step on the road to the complete privatisation of the NHS.

This is how I predict it will go:

Over a period of months, the government will demonise certain key demographics (this has worked well so far with the unemployed and disabled).  These demographics will include smokers, the obese, alcoholics and drug addicts.  After all, their problems are self-inflicted so why should YOU, the hard-working taxpayer be forced to shell out for their poor lifestyle choices?

Then, after a while, they'll introduce other people into the equation, for instance those who sustain injuries while playing sport.  ""Well, rugby is a dangerous game but you still chose to play it, so why should the honest, law-abiding taxpayer be made to fork out for your broken leg?""

Eventually, non-emergency or routine surgery will start to be categorised as either 'required' or 'optional'.  They will then be able to state that the 'optional' surgery should be paid for by the patient.

Yes, this is only a suggestion being made by the IFS, but I predict that the current government will seize on it very quickly.  I give it 24-hours before we see an opinion piece or two on ""the self-inflicted unwell"" and how much they're costing Mr and Mrs Joe Bloggs who are simply trying to live their lives whilst ""doing the right thing"".

If someone wants to move to England, not learn the language and simply be part of their own small community, that's up to them. I think it's a shame because they're missing out on a lot of interaction and enjoyment, but you pays your money, you takes your choice.

I suppose the issue many have is that, one lives in a country by choice. If you choose to live in France, that should be because you want to be in France, not because you want to be in your country but have nicer weather and lots of castles around, y'know? French people, afterall, don't have another France to go to. An Australian, English person, or Kazakh can always go back to prison, England, or Kazakhstan, but a French person doesn't have a second France to go to.

So I suppose essentially I'm (surprisingly) arguing that cultures should be allowed to dominate the country in which they originate, and while I am in support of integrating aspects of foreign cultures into that, I don't think a native culture of a country should be supplanted (barring certain exceptional cases) by another simply because people want the land, or the economic opportunities that a country has.",0,1341413349,null,0,false,0,c59bzo0,t3_vyvpe,t1_c59bzo0,t1_c59bdj0,null,1429294673,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Dear (me),

This Wednesday (4th July), the European Parliament resoundingly voted against ACTA!

The vote was 478 against, 39 in favour, with 165 abstentions.

This victory was thanks to your continued pressure which helped ensure that at every step of the way Europe’s representatives voted to reject the provisions within ACTA. We know that MEPs have been inundated with emails and calls from people who, just like you, have fought tirelessly in the defence of democratic freedoms.

Your persistence has paid off: MEPs have listened and stood up for democracy – some of them doing so quite literally in a moment of post-vote triumph, holding placards reading ‘Hello Democracy, Goodbye ACTA.’

Unwilling to let ACTA die, Commissioner Karel de Gucht announced that, regardless of the Parliament's rejection, the European Commission would wait for the ECJ's decision on the treaty's compatibility with fundamental rights and freedoms, before considering what to do next. This attempt to delay this issue further and pull the wool over our eyes will fail so long as the Open Rights Group and activists like you remain vigilant.

 Have you seen the gang warfare on America and Mexico? Or are you moron? Handguns are **everywhere** there.

 They have they highest rate of guns per 100 people in the world [(88.8 in 2007)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_gun_ownership). And... OH LOOK. [ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF FIREARM MORTALITIES IN THE WORLD (PAGE 6)](http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/ficap/resourcebook/pdf/monograph.pdf) and also [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate). Now I know you're going to go ""Oh but those aren't all handguns!"" Well look at this section and graphs on Wikipedia:

&gt;Handgun homicides accounted for nearly all of the overall increase in the homicide rate...

&gt;Gun-related homicide rates in the United States are twenty to thirty-five times higher than they are in countries that are economically and politically similar to it. Higher rates are found in developing countries and those with political instability.

That sounds like a *fucking great* policy on guns in America! I'm glad they aren't banned! /s 

Moron.

They are a job agency for sales roles in the UK, they also provide sales training. Most of the jobs they offer are business to business sales not selling to the public.

I gave them my CV at a recruitment fair at Man Uni (I was in my final year there at the time) I didn't pay them any attention as I was handing CV's out like crazy. They called me up, told me this was a telephone interview. I passed the interview but I had no idea what the hell was going on, they use so many bullshit buzz words and generic sounding we are awesome and we want the best speeches. I was very sceptical but in desperate need of a job, so i went to the assessment day (at their main complex in Wilmslow), which was the next stage of the process.

The assesment day was lots of group tasks, and a quick personal interview and other stuff. There were about 70 candidates there, most of them were jerks. 14 of us passed that and were asked, which industries we wanted to work in and what area. I was then told to wait for some calls. They set up 4 interviews for me, two at two really great companies two at some not so great companies. I got a job at the one I liked (an engineering company). I'm still in the job and like it a lot.

It can work out very well for people as Pareto will work very hard to get you interviews, however do not make the mistake of thinking they care about you, you are just a product to be sold as far as they are concerned. So take advantage if you can but don't get to sucked in to their very, fake and irritating public persona.

You're in for a lot of fun on reddit then, if you're going to base assertions on them.

&gt;But when you see that there is a lot of gun ownership among gangs it's clear that acquiring them is not difficult.

Where do we 'see' this? How many gangs do *not* have guns, for example? Because without info, I would dispute this - and in any case, such an observation is irrelevant when compared to the ease of use over obtaining guns in the US and the statistics for gun-related deaths.

&gt;But the US is a different country with a different culture.

Yes, it is - but you can't assume that when faced with gun ownership/ gun crime rates that the two aren't connected and that it must be culture.

&gt;Before the handgun ban there was handgun ownership but far less gun crime.

If you're going to suggest the two are connected, you have to demonstrate how. How do you know that gun crime wouldn't have risen anyway, for instance?

&gt;In all of the areas completely unrelated to firearm ownership. More widespread firearm ownership could prevent many of the crimes that are increasing, muggings at knife point being an incredibly worrying one.

Ignoring that there's no real evidence for an arms race at this level leading to more peace, How does this assertion stand against the [statistics for firearms-related-deaths?]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate) - note the difference between the USA and UK per head.

&gt;Yes. Guns are used for sport, defence, display and as a tool.

Sorry, you're going to have to try harder. Guns have a primary function, and that's killing things; everything else is secondary. Cars have many uses, but you're trying to elevate an unfortunate side-effect to a primary function.

&gt;I'm not an expert on US law, but It seems closer to what I would like here.

In which case, you have to illustrate why implementing US law wouldn't lead to similar gun-related crime rates.

&gt;So by legislating that 40% of the board must be women you're forcing men who've worked hard out of their jobs and have placed women who are not nearly as good in their place.

This is legislation in place already? Are we now going to assert that any proposed legislation can be treated as fact? Alternatively, are you suggesting that employers have always ensured a reasonable mix of nationalities, and legislation that was introduced to force them to do what they should have been doing anyway was actually pointless? In any case, I was illustrating why exaggerations such as 'in the slightest' can't be used outside of the Daily Mail.

&gt;Because you can't really say you like a country because it's close to another country, especially not in a world with aeroplanes. It was always a ridiculous thing to include.

Yes you can, when you're talking about the number of different countries surrounding yours. Aeroplanes are a slightly more involved approach than cars or trains, and you still seem to be assuming that aeroplanes are just as easy and cheap an option as cars or trains, which is not (and has never been) the case - if it was, people from the UK would be visiting places all over the world with distance/ time/ cost having no effect at all.

&gt;It's cheaper to travel from Birmingham to Edinburgh by plane than it is by train and it takes less time, airport included.

And there's enough capacity for this to allow everyone to travel, yes? Try taking a family. Now try visiting some countries in the EU via plane, and see how cheap, quick and easy it is.

&gt;I can opt out of paying national insurance now?

No, you stated that you were forced to use a single service. You aren't, you're expected to pay so that *everyone* can use the service, just like police and the fire brigade. Half the reason the Americans have gotten into such trouble with their health service is the 'fuck everyone else, what about me?' approach.

&gt;So as someone who tries to stay healthy, eats well, exercises and doesn't smoke, why should I pay for everyone else? 

As someone who's never been run over, why should I have to pay for you when you do? Are you now suggesting the American approach is a shining example of how it's done, when they're in the middle of admitting it isn't?

&gt;Why should my taxes go to pay for obese people, smokers and people who injured themselves in a late night punch up? 

Smokers pay far, far more tax than you do in NI - shall we allow them to choose the treatment for your illness or decide your benefits when it's nothing to do with them but they pay more?

&gt;I have to pay for house and car insurance, why not health insurance?

You don't have to own a house, or a car. And car insurance is so that if you hit someone else and it's your fault, they're covered. House insurance is so that if you have a huge mortgage, it's covered if you burn it down. Now define how people's health is a commodity that's optional. You're going to get sick one day, and die - why should I have to pay towards your treatment? After all, I'm not dying. It's twelve-year-old's logic.

&gt;I'm not even a higher earner and I know I would have more money without the welfare state.

Which would then be swallowed at a fast rate by your medical insurance when you got sick, and when you run out of money, you'll just have to die. You should really look into what trouble the Americans have gotten into with this approach if you're going to base your outlook on it.

&gt; I would have a better pension and healthcare as well.

And no money, or piece of mind that come what may, you will get treatment of some sort.

&gt;It's called criticism, we don't have enough of it in many aspects of politics.

Agreed. But assuming the US way is a gold standard might not be the optimum way forward.

&gt;I'm going to have to disagree.

Well, go do some digging and bring back some facts :-)

&gt;You seem to equate less generous payouts as being a worse system.

You're suggesting that the US welfare system is more generous with payouts? Good luck with that.

But I dont know if there is an ""inbetween""  with guns in society.  It may be an  all or nothing - we all have them or nobody does.



 I have lived in South Africa and I feel much safer in the UK then SA.  I could have a gun in SA but it offered me no defense  against a criminal with an AK47.  Also crime happens so fast that you dont have much time to react or get out your gun from its safe place. (by law you had to keep it in a safe, also it could not be in view when carrying it around )

And also once  some people have a gun then you also have  criminals attempting to steal  guns from law abiding citizens.   Never mind the accidents that happen in homes with guns around.  

I know criminals can always get guns, and do so in the UK but it is not as widespread as criminals who have guns in SA.  The UK currently has a lot less violent crime then it would have if guns were more easily available.

true,carbondate,null,null,"I like their story arcs.  The larger ones, I mean.  Ten's story was about the depth of his loneliness and guilt.  He had killed his entire civilization (including, presumably, his own children and grandchildren) to save the rest of time and space.  He was so starved for companionship that he fell in love with a human girl (and then lost her), but while he was sad to lose her, his grief was more like the loss of a favorite pet compared against the grief he displayed upon the death of his arch-fucking-nemesis.  Toward the end, as he isolated himself more and more, he became vain and mad with his own power.  Throughout Series 4, he tried to sacrfice himself no less than three times.  Saving the Earth from the Sontarans, saving the people trapped in the Library, and finally, to stop the Time Lords from bringing about the Ultimate Sanction.  Each time, he survived.  And in the end, he was forced to sacrifice himself for one old man.  It wasn't because he had to die that he was upset.  It was because, in his mind, his sacrifice was just so... fucking... meaningless.  But he did it anyway.  He wanted something big to redeem himself, but he ultimately redeemed himself by placing the single old man's life ahead of his own.

Eleven's story is about him being near the end and grappling with his own mortality.  He has one or two regenerations left, and then he's done.  With the Ponds, he has something he didn't have with his prior companions: family.  With River, he has someone who can actually challenge him.  He has something to live for now, as opposed to when he was Ten, when he was largely looking for something to die for.  Eleven has grown comfortable with the fact that he's going to die someday (relatively) soon... just not yet.

And then there's Nine, whom I felt didn't get fully explored.

Looking at the three of them in terms of a larger story arc, rather than a competition, they all complement each other.  And when the show comes to an end, it does have to end with the Doctor's death.  As Ten said, ""You need a good death. Without death there'd only be comedies. Death gives us size.""

If the ""Journey's End"" regeneration counts (and I think it ought to; it resulted in the creation of a separate Doctor), then he has one left.  The 12th may be the last.  Or they can retcon it so he has unlimited regenerations and just continues indefinitely.  But a story without end grows tedious.  They need to finish the Doctor's story at some point and make it a good ending.

We tend to have the standard American news reporter accent rather than the southern. The average household income is $100,000 USD. Average education is a 4 year university degree. Common past times include golf, gaming, working out, running, rock climbing, billiards, drinking, shooting, hunting, fishing, kayaking, cooking, bowling, movies, dining out, reading, roller skating, rowing, sight seeing, camping...

My next door neighbor is Bolivian, his wife Argentinian. They just got their citizenship. Both of their children are American. Next down is a Vietnamese couple. Their family is Louisiana Bayou Creole Vietnamese. Parse that mix, my racist friend. Their daughters are both Americans, and the third on the way will be an American. After that is a white couple from Pennsylvania. He has a government job with security clearance and is an avid runner. She is a Wiccan marijuana advocate and former dog breeder. They have no children. Across the street is a white couple from New Jersey. She's a health care professional and he's a history teacher. Both of their children are Americans. Next to them is a Korean couple. Next to them is an El Salvadoran family. Next to them is a black family. Next to them a house owned by an Ethiopian family since the neighborhood was built, but rented out the last several years.

Here's the interesting part. The last few summers, that house was rented to a group of soccer coaches from the UK. These guys were rude, inconsiderate and arrogant. They constantly parked in the parking spaces of both next door neighbors and were shitty when asked to move. They threw loud parties in the middle of the week in disregard to people who had day jobs and were obnoxious when asked to keep it down. They let their industrial sized trashcan fester on the curb for weeks. When my Bolivian neighbor asked them to please pull it around back where it belonged because the stench was making his children sick when they were playing outside, two of them upended it on his porch, soaking the pavement in disgusting rain water sewage juice that had been marinating in the can for a week. The neighborhood collectively asked the Ethiopian family to please not let them return this year, and out of respect they found new renters.

If ALL I want is Freeview and OnDemand, lets forget everything else, then an Xbox is £115. That's it.

It's an annual fee, of £35. So for the same price as a YouView I can have an Xbox 360 and **5** years of Xbox live service.

The problem is knifes are far more dangerous than guns are. Sure, you can hit someone further away with a firearm but you need to be damn good to do that, they're loud, require ammo and always leave a specific signature.

Knives are silent, cause insane amounts of damage very quickly and never leave a signature so you can't trace them easily.

While they are both capable of so much damage, they are capable of good as well. 

Proper firearms, i'm talking 5.56/7.62/9/12.7mm on a range would be lovely to own and use, on a range (Or hunting, something like that) just because they're more than an air rifle. (which can do some damage regardless of what people say)

You have missed the point.   I dont think you can allow law abiding citizens to have access to guns in isolation where they can shoot happily at ranges.   Its not the way it works in real like.

Its naive to think that only the good guys with license will have a gun.   The reality is criminals will have more access to guns and we will end up with more incidents of injured bystanders, or crimes being committed against gun owners to get access to their guns.



Yes, SA does have its special issues, but so does the US and the UK.   We have a large feral/underclass/yob  community here in the UK who do not have any excuse to be violent fucks but yet they are.   

I would rather not give them access to guns as well.  If it means I have to go without a gun so be it.

I'm sure you log everything you come across in a database for later discussion on Reddit.

This is footage of a gang with a gun.
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-14601228

&gt;such an observation is irrelevant when compared to the ease of use over obtaining guns in the US.

Before the handgun ban, gun crime was lower than it is today. It was also lower than the US. So, no, it's perfectly relevant.

&gt;Yes, it is - but you can't assume that when faced with gun ownership/ gun crime rates that the two aren't connected and that it must be culture.

Gang and criminal culture is much more prevalent in the US, that coupled with the fronter mentality is what causes so much violence.

&gt;If you're going to suggest the two are connected, you have to demonstrate how. How do you know that gun crime wouldn't have risen anyway, for instance?

I'm sure gun crime would have risen, but that doesn't change the fact that the ban didn't even lower crime. Most gun crime is gang on gang violence. Very little is committed using legal firearms.

&gt;Ignoring that there's no real evidence for an arms race at this level leading to more peace, How does this assertion stand against the [statistics for firearms-related-deaths?]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate) - note the difference between the USA and UK per head.

Again, it's the culture.

&gt;Sorry, you're going to have to try harder. Guns have a primary function, and that's killing things; everything else is secondary. Cars have many uses, but you're trying to elevate an unfortunate side-effect to a primary function.

The primary function of a gun is to launch a projectile at high velocity. It's true that this is often used to kill, but that doesn't mean they're bad. You can use them for hunting, shooting, defence and just for display. Just because you can use one to murder a human being doesn't mean they should be banned. The primary purpose of a stake knife is to cut flesh, do we ban those too?

&gt;In which case, you have to illustrate why implementing US law wouldn't lead to similar gun-related crime rates.

I don't want US style laws, I want laws similar to what we had before Major and Blair.

&gt;This is legislation in place already? 

No, it's not been passed yet.

&gt;Are we now going to assert that any proposed legislation can be treated as fact? Alternatively, are you suggesting that employers have always ensured a reasonable mix of nationalities, and legislation that was introduced to force them to do what they should have been doing anyway was actually pointless? 

There is no quota on minority participation anywhere, that would be retarded.

&gt;Yes you can, when you're talking about the number of different countries surrounding yours. Aeroplanes are a slightly more involved approach than cars or trains, and you still seem to be assuming that aeroplanes are just as easy and cheap an option as cars or trains, which is not (and has never been) the case - if it was, people from the UK would be visiting places all over the world with distance/ time/ cost having no effect at all.

Aeroplanes are fairly cheap. But the thing is that most people aren't going to be travelling across continents regularly, so it's really irrelevant.

&gt;And there's enough capacity for this to allow everyone to travel, yes? Try taking a family. Now try visiting some countries in the EU via plane, and see how cheap, quick and easy it is.

Where are you going with this?

&gt;No, you stated that you were forced to use a single service. You aren't, you're expected to pay so that everyone can use the service, just like police and the fire brigade. Half the reason the Americans have gotten into such trouble with their health service is the 'fuck everyone else, what about me?' approach.

Hence I am forced to use the NHS, I can't afford to pay for two insurance plans. 

&gt;As someone who's never been run over, why should I have to pay for you when you do? Are you now suggesting the American approach is a shining example of how it's done, when they're in the middle of admitting it isn't?

You shouldn't have to pay for me, I an pay for myself.

I am certainly not saying that their system is a ""shining example"", I just think it's fairer than ours.

&gt;Smokers pay far, far more tax than you do in NI - shall we allow them to choose the treatment for your illness or decide your benefits when it's nothing to do with them but they pay more?

Not if they're on benefits. Obese people don't pay more tax, drunks don't, chavs don't and so on.

But again, no, they should even have to pay for my care.

&gt;You don't have to own a house, or a car. And car insurance is so that if you hit someone else and it's your fault, they're covered. House insurance is so that if you have a huge mortgage, it's covered if you burn it down. Now define how people's health is a commodity that's optional. You're going to get sick one day, and die - why should I have to pay towards your treatment? After all, I'm not dying. It's twelve-year-old's logic.

That's life. It's more childish to believe that the state should pick you up.

&gt;Which would then be swallowed at a fast rate by your medical insurance when you got sick, and when you run out of money, you'll just have to die. You should really look into what trouble the Americans have gotten into with this approach if you're going to base your outlook on it.

There are ways of protecting people without having the nationalise the entire healthcare system. There can be legislation protecting consumers.

&gt;And no money, or piece of mind that come what may, you will get treatment of some sort.

Slow care, poor care and rationed care. Some people have been turned away treatment because the NHS can't afford it.

&gt;Agreed. But assuming the US way is a gold standard might not be the optimum way forward.

I don't even like the US, I certainly don't want to incorporate much from them. It's just that in a lot of ways they are like the UK 50 years ago, they have preserved many British values that we have lost.

&gt;You're suggesting that the US welfare system is more generous with payouts? Good luck with that.

The US pays out less, which is a good thing. You seem to think that more is better. Things like food stamps are superior to just handing out cash to people. It means that they can only buy food with them and they have to live with the public humiliation of it.

The house.

Living room - Cinema size screen with a large U shaped sofa. A fully stocked bar.

Kitchen - I don't really care as long as it has an island in the middle! Also needs a massive fridge.

Dining room - Large table capable of sitting 10+ people.

Gym - A fully equipped gym with cardio machines, weight equipment, sauna and steam room.

Bedrooms. There would be 4 bedrooms, each being fairly large and with their own en-suites. Another room would be my computer room which would house my £100,000 gaming monster and a huge PC gaming area. In another room would be the console room. Large HD TV's with a PS3, 360 and maybe a fucking Wii.

* Cars! Pagani Zonda Cinque Roadster. Only 5 ever built, worth around £1.2 million. Range Rover Sport. Mercedes-Bens S500 - W140. 

* Helicopter for travelling long distances.

* Superfastextremesuperfast Broadband. I'd maybe even make my own ISP.

* I'd also stick some cash in the bank to just earn interest.

* Businesses. I would outright buy a few businesses such as Taxi Firms, Corner shops and houses to rent out.

No. A protection racket is where a group extorts money out of you in return for protection against people from their own group. Since the government is protecting you from anyone and everyone that would steal your shit if the police weren't about, they are offering a legitimate service. 

&gt; We have had private security firms working at festivals, corporate events and street parties in the UK for quite some time. We have private investigators, who, despite being limited in their powers, are often more effective and more efficient than the police. We have private, independent arbitrators and mediators, like the CIARB who provide cheap and effective justice, statefree.

All of whom would be utterly powerless without the power of the state to back them up. Take your biggest security firm in existence today and they could easily be overrun by an angry mob, and there would be no laws to stop it happening either.

&gt; There was a time when government was independent of the monetary system

No, there was a time when the private sector had nothing to do with the monetary system, when all money was created by the state.

Oh god!  More revisionist nonsense out of the States.  Hitler wasn't a socialist, he killed socialists by the bucketload (or at least, had them killed); he completely despised leftists, socialists, communists, anarchists and was brought to power by large companies (we can name some of them if you like, a number are still trading) which shared this view.  Hitler was the last bastion of capitalism against either socialism or communism in Germany.  That's why the Daily Mail liked him.

But let's listen to him in his own words: 

""When I take charge of Germany, I shall end tribute abroad and Bolshevism at home.""

""Bolshevism is our greatest menace. Kill Bolshevism in Germany and you restore 70 million people to power. France owes her strength not to her armies but to the forces of Bolshevism.""

""The Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of St Germain are kept alive by Bolshevism in Germany. The Peace Treaty and Bolshevism are two heads of one monster. We must decapitate both.""

And, in his tradition of trying to confuse things as with his party's name:

""Socialism is the science of dealing with the common weal. Communism is not Socialism. Marxism is not Socialism. The Marxians have stolen the term and confused its meaning. I shall take Socialism away from the Socialists.""

""Marxism has no right to disguise itself as socialism. Socialism, unlike Marxism, does not repudiate private property. Unlike Marxism, it involves no negation of personality, and unlike Marxism, it is patriotic."" (WTF?!?)

""We might have called ourselves the Liberal Party. We chose to call ourselves the National Socialists. We are not internationalists. Our socialism is national. We demand the fulfilment of the just claims of the productive classes by the state on the basis of race solidarity. To us state and race are one.""

He was certainly a nutcase, but he wasn't a socialist by any measure anyone who understood socialism would understand as socialist.

That would explain it then

&gt;Yes, I've seen bit's of it, unless the organisation you have an NDA with are prone to misleading people with inaccurate mock ups. 

Nope that's part of the GUI, however there is a difference between a screen shot of the GUI and actually navigating it. Personally I prefer it over Sky and Virgin GUI (ignoring Freeview GUI as they differ on every single box going)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0loi-utZi4

&gt;Basically what you're saying is the initial set up is worth over £150

Pretty much, If i already had a 360 with all the TV Tuner, remotes and the updates, then getting the on demand stuff would be simple using the 360.

&gt;The ""packages"" on YouView are the free stuff you get on TV with some internet on demand thrown in and DVR features that are also on SKy/Virgin boxes. So as it stands, the offerings of YouView are inferior to Sky or Virgin.

This is the point I cannot disprove to you due to NDA, but suffice to say you might be surprised to see what the paid content will be.

Bear in mind that [BT snapped up the rights to League games from ESPN](http://www.techradar.com/news/television/espn-loses-rights-to-premier-league-games-to-bt-1084958) shows that Youview will have some Sports that Sky will not. 

[the current box is only the launch device as well and they are working with manufacturers to roll out more](http://thenextweb.com/uk/2012/07/04/youview-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-uks-new-tv-service-and-why-it-might-succeed/)

Guess the only thing we can do is wait and see what happens.

Esp as Sky announced their [Now TV](http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2012/07/youviews-killer-search-might-actually-make-it-worth-buying-eventually/) will be on Youview as well....

Also I liked this little bit of info....
&gt;Possibly the most interesting bit of Lord Sugar’s spiel today was that YouView’s actively looking to add additional IP-only TV channels, ones that are delivered over your broadband only. Essentially he said that anyone with £50,000 can buy a slot on the YouView EPG and stream their channel to viewers. It could be that we’ll see loads of hyper-local or public access IPTV channels crop up — maybe even something like a Gizmodo channel — whether you’ll actually want to watch them though, is another matter.

true,emericuh,lfcflame,,"&gt; It has more to do with what Arsenal and Spurs are doing than what we're not doing.

First, both teams have only signed one player. Arsenal could potentially lose RVP, their only consistent attacking player. Podolski has never been a consistent player and while he's a quality signing, he won't fill the hole that will be there if Robin leaves.

Likewise, Tottenham will lose Adebayor, Modric, and possibly even Van Der Vart. Their captain, Ledley King, who has been crucial to their defence (which went to shambles at the end of the season) for years is retiring and Scott Parker can hardly play for more than 60 minutes lately.    If you think Sigurdsson, who had half a good season at Swansea, is enough to cover all of those losses, you are deluding yourself.

I just went looking through transfer histories and I cannot find a **single** LFC transfer for a first team player in the first week of the window going back at least 5 years. 

And to call me overtly optimistic is just naive. There were never any illusions in my thoughts that we would be able to beat a team like Tottenham to Sigurdsson's signature. If anyone's judgement is clouded, it would be yours to find this news, which should be of no surprise, ""sobering"".

To balance the scales somewhat, Europe has plenty of problems the U.S. doesn't - we are much more strongly against immigration than a lot of Americans are.

(that's my affiliate link to them which gives 10% off for new signups, and a similar discount to me off my next payment - here's the plain link to [www.freeagent.com](http://www.freeagent.com/) if you prefer.)

(Edit: the below is not Emily's blog post, which is linked to above, but my own comments on the issue)

So... I'm probably breaking the First Rule of Fight Club here, but...

Imagine a UK limited company owned by a married couple each 50% shareholders, and directors, which makes £200,000 in a year.  

It could pay both directors (for work actually done) a salary above the Lower Earnings Limit and below the Primary Threshold (about £7000 a year) and they personally would receive NI credit even though no NI (employees' or employers') was paid.  This is possible because the National Minimum Wage does not apply to Directors (unless they have a contract of service with the company in question, which might be sensible in some circumstances if the value of potential benefits-in-kind exceeded the NI due (all kinds) on a NMW salary - but I digress).

They could then each receive dividends totalling (including the Dividend Tax Credit), the balance of (Personal Allowance + Basic Rate Limit) minus the  Salary paid.  In this circumstance the directors would pay zero income tax or NI.  The only taxation on that £200k would be corporation tax at 21% - and the Salary (though not the divis of course) paid would be deductible from that.

The remainder of the profit would remain in the company, and although it could be distributed as further dividends, to do so would take the shareholders above the basic rate limit and the excess would be taxed (on them as individuals) at an effective rate of 25%.

(The dividend tax credit is a bit hard to succintly explain, and counter-intuitively named; its effect is to make dividend income of, say, £10,000 to ""count"" as (100/90) of that amount was received (£11,111).  It's that ""grossed-up"" dividend which is added to other personal income (such as the minimal salary I talked about above), and if that exceeds the basic rate limit, the excess is taxed at 25%.)

All of this has been a staple of small-business tax planning for years and has been debated and tested in the UK legal and legisative systems. 

Whether it's *fair* that a married couple like this could effectively receive about £84,000 a year tax free (assuming their business were successful enough to do that), is another question altogether - but it is *entirely* legal.  For my mind, despite what the tabloids (and No. 11) might want us to think, there's a big difference between legal tax *avoidance* and illegal *evasion*.  This compensation structure rewards entrepreneurs and freelancers for the risks they run in their business and compensates them for the things they don't have (unless their company chooses to provide them, I suppose) like sick pay and paid holidays.

**TL;dr: a UK ltd company owner can structure their remuneration to pay zero income tax or national insurance, effectively earning about £42k pa tax-free, and this is both entirely legal and common; whether it should be is another question.**",0,1341422033,null,0,1341430543,0,c59dqj5,t3_w0s1o,t1_c59dqj5,t1_c59cuyg,null,1429295495,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

On any profit you make you must pay a corporation tax of 20% for anything up to £300k. Additionally, if you take any of those profits as dividend income, you must pay 10%, 32% or 42% depending on how much you take. You also get a 10% rebate if you are above the threshold of PAYE income. Combined, corporation tax and dividend is more or less the same as income tax.

Based on this table: http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/incometax/basics.htm#6 we can say:

|£0 to £2,710 Starting rate for savings|na|na|

- Fractional reserve banking has also been around a long time. I can't find a date, but I think the practise existed for hundreds of years. The Bank of Amsterdam closed in 1819 because it *didn't* offer fractional reserve lending, so it was around then. I would expect we've had fractional reserve lending since then or before.
- A currency based on debt follows from fractional reserve london; see above.

So unless I'm mistaken, we've had all of those things since well before the second world war. Maybe you're thinking of the gold standard?

true,WastedTruth,null,null,"In my example above, you're right that the company would pay CT on (200k-14k less any other deductibles) which would be a fair wad of cash, and entirely fair. But the individuals would receive £84k without any income tax or NI deducted from it. 

I think you might have misunderstood how the dividend tax credit works and its purpose;  but any accountant or the community at the forum I mentioned earlier could help explain if you wish. 

Edit - ah I see one place where I was ambiguous earlier - when I said they could pay themselves a divi totalling ""(including the tax credit)"" what that means is...

Imagine for simplicity that the basic rate tax limit was £30,000 and the personal allowance was £10,000. Our mythical director  receives a salary of £7k.  If he received a payment of a dividend of £30,000, then the notional tax credit means it would count as income of £33,333 and his total income in the year for income tax purposes would be £43,333 (even though he'd only received £40k) and income tax would be due at 25% on the £3,333 excess above the BR limit.   Hope that helps!

Edit 2 - screwy numbers there, his notional income would be £4**0**,333, and 25% would be due on the excess £333, even though he'd only received £37k; remember that these are with fake limits for simplicity, the real ones are a few k different either way.

Obviously she's become quite accustomed to kissing him, and although the Doctor has been kissed by many people, he hasn't make a habit of regularly kissing anyone. I think the one and only time he ever kissed Rose, who we know for sure he loved, was when he took the time vortex from her.

For the record, ""dirty bombs"" are nothing more than propaganda on both sides. They spread fear and panic but all nuclear experts agree that as a weapon they are a non-event. We're talking zero casualties provided there was quick evacuation and clean-up, you'd be better spiking someone's soup with polonium! With rads it's all about exposure times. You'll be fine provided you don't lick the windows. Diesel fumes from traffic are far worse for you. 

If dirty bombs worked then the super powers would have had them in their arsenal over the cold war. They'd be ideal for area denial and they were tested for this purpose with nation-state levels of resource. The idea was binned because it didn't work. 

&gt; or fly a plane

That is now no longer a threat, as has been repetitively proven in the west. Any attempt to hijack results in immediate counter-attack from the passengers. The days of trying to sit it out are long gone. 

&gt; I do believe religious fundamentalism poses a real threat

Then why are we attacking Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia etc? Shouldn't we be aiming at those who actually fund &amp; command terrorism on a notable scale such as the Saudis? They provide the ideological base for the entire movement. Clearly our own government doesn't even see it as a threat, as the Saudi's are our good friends. Hell, they just handed Libya over to some of the more mental fundamentalists around, the LIFG. They'll label you an ""infidel"" and hang/burn you purely on the colour of your skin, even if you are 100% Muslim. Yet our news barely mentions this side of things. Quite inconsistent...

In the old days The Empire simply invaded Iraq (etc) without batting an eyelid. Four times in the last 100 years for what it's worth. If you don't like it some old lady will stick a white feather in your lapel. The ""Global Islamic Threat"" was born out of a need to validate the fourth invasion, the first to take place in the Information Age when that form of patriotism had dried up. It's so far gone that the propaganda of the era is now ironic pop art &amp; memes to us! Keep calm! 

The fourth invasion of Iraq required an entirely new kind of propaganda, after all, we are a democracy and the citizenry has to be made to approve. So this idea of an inter-connected network of unified terrorists was invented when frankly it didn't exist. Al Qaeda had a couple dozen ""members"" in 2001, most of them more accurately belonging to other groups who tolerated Bin Laden as the rich kid on the block. Unfortunately our myth of Al Qaeda became a self-fulfilling prophesy, our world-wide marketing for them caused numerous unaffiliated groups to spring up &amp; claim allegiance, groups such as ""Al Qaeda in Iraq"" for example. Most of them have never heard of Sayyid Qutb, the guy who wrote their doctrine. Over time (many years) these groups did develop token ""links"" with the mothership (much like the Kevin Bacon game), but the idea of their being an ""Al Qaeda #1"" giving out orders &amp; resources is nonsensical.",0,1341430424,null,0,false,0,c59fkix,t3_w0yo6,t1_c59fkix,t1_c59bfun,null,1429296442,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

So what? Income tax and NI is just a PAYE thing, the rest of the tax they pay on it more than makes up for it. 20% corp tax from £200k -£14k leaves £148.8k. Split between two is £74.4. That lies well within the upper rate dividend bracket, so they would be taxed 32.5% on it. And they would not get any discount because they are not eligible for the dividend tax credit.

It changes nothing tbh. Our family with a £200k profit taking £7k wages would not be eligible for the tax credit.

IANE, but one way I think of this is a simplified economy where there is one company that makes everything (food, tractors, the lot). The money goes around between the producer (the factory) and the consumers , so you can follow a pound around in a cycle. Let's assume the factory is non-profit so that there is no shareholder cycle.

Because of banding and personal allowances, these figures are estimates of the average amount paid.

* Money leaves producer (factory) account
* NI paid (employer contribution) 13.8%
* NI paid (employee contribution) 12%
* income tax paid 22% 
* money enters consumer account
* consumer buys something
* VAT paid 20%
* money enters producer account
* corporation tax at 22% on profits (and assume profits are 10%) 2.2%

Now calculate the amount left after tax as (1-13.8%)*(1-12%)*(1-22%)... and I estimate you end up retaining about 37% of the spending power, with 63% disappearing as tax in the cycle.

Now I'm sure one can argue over the method - in particular the tax will actually go off to pay government workers, who buy from the company, making the situation less bad than it appears. Still, the point is that the distinction between the five types of tax here is pretty artificial at best, and at worst serves to hide the tax.",0,1341431364,null,0,false,0,c59frhc,t3_w0s1o,t1_c59frhc,t1_c59e24q,null,1429296527,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;The problem as I see it is that we currently have 3 strikers (Aguero, Balotelli, and Dzeko) that are at their best when playing as the furthest man forward. They can all function deeper, but Tevez is the only player that is truly at his best playing just behind a main striker.

&gt;Of our four strikers Tevez looks to be the one most likely to leave this summer, and if we replace him with Van Persie, that leaves us with 4 players that will want to be the spearhead of the attack (one of whom already has a reputation for sulking and causing trouble). As good as RVP is, he's not the right kind of player, plus he's also knocking on a bit, and has a terrible injury record. He's absolutely the wrong choice in my eyes.

That is fucking bollocks, those people deserve an independent review, aside from parliamentary scrutiny, primarily because both parties are probably hugely complicit to some extent in some seriously fucking naughty goings-on.

As a (near) resident and fan of Detroit sports for 35 years, I've found Everton to fit in with the mold of Detroit sports.  Ignoring the Lions, what you have is a team of work-horses, a ""blue-collar"" team, a team that will leave you feeling elated and let-down at the same time.  I love it!  Everton tends to start slow, but finish strong.  They don't have nearly the same amount of cash as Liverpool, so they build a team on good buys and youth development.  In recent years, they don't score a lot, but have a nice defense.  The infusion of Jelavic this year helped to bring the scoring up a bit.

I don't know of an Everton resource for you, but in the past several years of building up my football knowledge and fandom, the first being podcasts.  My favorite two are the Football Ramble and Football Weekly.  Chappers had a good one a couple of years ago, but that one is gone now.  

The second thing that I've done is read books, piles of them.  Among the Thugs, Inverting the Pyramid, Fever Pitch, Brilliant Orange, Soccernomics, The World Is A Ball, and some others.  

A third thing that I've done to really familiarize myself with the players in world football is play Fantasy Football on the European Yahoo site.  I spend more time on the Premiere League, but each national league has its own nationalities that tend to flock there.  For example, rarely any English players stray outside of the Prem, but the French Ligue 1 has a lot of French and African players.  

Since European football has been more accessible here, I've loved it.  I don't watch anything else anymore and have really enjoyed learning as much as I can about it all.

&gt;Jan Vertonghen made his return with Ajax against VV Oldenzaal. The captain actually wants to begin training next monday with Tottenham Hotspur, but because there is no agreement between all parties, he will join the Ajax selection for now. He played his first minutes with mixed feelings.


&gt;""I am happy with the guys at Ajax. I really don't mind being here,"" he said after the match to Ajax Life and others. ""I know my function: to be an example as captain. I have respect for Ajax and my teammates.""

&gt;That doesn't mean that he wouldn't rather have been in London of course. Vertonghen is ready for a new adventure, his trainers also told him he's ready for it. ""Now it is a case between the agents and the clubs. I still hope that they can get it done. But it's a different situation than I had expected.""

&gt;Vertonghen played for half an hour in Oldenzaal. Against the third division team he had a very calm night. Though his heartbeat was quite high, according to trainer Frank de Boer. Was that because of the transfer difficulties? Vertonghen denies. ""I have been sick, and just returned from my holiday. This was my first match again. I still have to improve my condition. Next to the matches I sometimes have my mind elsewhere, but during a game itself not. It's not easy to switch that button, but I can do it.""

true,Bob_Latchford,null,null,"Sites like bluekipper and grandoldteam are up to date news/rumour sites by fans so they tend to be a laugh as well as giving an Evertonian's side of the story.

Everton are the 4th most successful team in English history (behind Liverpool, United and Arsenal). We've won the league 9 times (although no premier league title yet, the premier league was created in 1992) and the FA cup 5 times (most recently 1995) as well as a European trophy (cup winners cup 1985).

Since the 80s we haven't had much to shout about, we were nearly relegated a couple of times and stayed up on the last game of the season, but since David Moyes took over from Walter Smith as manager in 2002 we've been on the rise again. Despite having very little money (Everton are owned by fan Bill Kenwright, not a massive business) we have brought in some incredible (unproven) players and turned them into superstars (Arteta, Cahill, Lescott, Baines to name a few) thanks to Moyes' scouting and football knowledge.

Common Everton themes: hard-work (there are no prima donnas or divers at Everton), not much money(speaks for itself) and inconsistent performances (last few seasons we've started badly after losing key players in the transfer window and gone on to have a really good end of season).

[Class of '85](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVnVI2xov5g) is a must watch. 

With regards to the team:

Keeper, the amazing American Tim Howard.

Left back: The magisterial Baines (who is wanted by the big clubs) 

Centre Backs: Phil Jagielka and either Distin or Heitinga (although last season heits and distin formed a great partnership while jags was injured)

Right back we have Hibbert (an Everton legend who has played more than 300 games for us yet never scored a goal, HIBBO SCORES WE RIOT) or more usually the skipper (captain) Phil Neville, brother of the famous Gary. 

Our defensive midfielder is Fellaini (the enormous one with the amazing afro) who is a Belgian master at football. Seriously, there is a reason all the biggest clubs want him.

For now, the rest of the midfield will depend on who goes/comes in this summer transfer window. We really want to re-sign Pienaar as he's a great left midfielder. Hopefully we can get Donovan from Galaxy again to play on the right but that looks like a long shot.

As for goal-scorers, just today we signed a new striker, Naismith who came from Rangers. Naismith followed Jelavic the croatian from Rangers who joined us last January and has not stopped scoring.

There's so much to write and you probably have questions anyway so I hope this provides some basic framework for you to follow the mighty blues and how we play/our ethos. 

Sorry for going on.

EDIT: It's a grand old team to play for,

it's a grand old team to support.

Bupa healthcare and a private pension would probably cost me less than what the government takes from me. It seems to me like the only people who benefit are those who don't work and save. The welfare state is a mess in this country.

But the US spends massively more than the UK per person on healthcare! First they pay more in tax than us, to fund Medicare and whatnot, and then they spend huge sums on private insurance. Overall we're talking about a healthcare system that's more than twice as expensive as ours per person. BUPA is cheap because: 1) they send you to the NHS for the expensive or tricky stuff, and 2) they use NHS-trained doctors and nurses instead of spending money training their own.

The only problem comes when you don't plan ahead, when you take the £100 without being able to pay it back on payday, and you end up spiralling out of control. 

To be honest, if you don't finance for it, it is your own fault. Yes, it is always better to borrow off friends and family, but if you can't pay it back, don't take it.

Stayed in London both times, with a day trip to Bath by the Orient Express train the last time we were there. Had an interesting conversation with the cab driver in Bath, who drove us up to the Royal Crescent. He said he'd lived in Bath all his life, and would never visit London again. When asked why, he replied ""It's not English anymore, is it."" 

Fascinating. I guess London is too international for him?

Things I love about England are:

The beer I can get in a pub. English Ale, served at cellar temperature, is simply the finest beer I've ever drank. We drink it too cold here in the States - sure Lager should be cold, but not ale. EDIT: I can also walk outside the pub to the sidewalk and enjoy my beer on a nice warm London evening. If I did this in the USA, I might get arrested for drinking alcohol in public!

Transportation - in London the tube is incredible. The buses are also amazing. And London is a very walkable city, but watch out for traffic! The cars don't seem to want to stop for pedestrians at all!

Food - yes, I love British Food. I have some English heritage in my family, so it must be in me already. 

English accents - what accent?! you ask. To Yank ears, there is a distinct accent. And I find it simply gorgeous. Especially listening to female voices. 

History - there is a Roman Wall in London. Here in Seattle, we have a few buildings that are more than 100 years old...that's about all there is. In London, something that was build around 100 years ago is considered new.

Money - agreed. It is wonderful to have a coin in your pocket that is actually worth something, and you don't need to get 12-20 of them together to buy something! The coinage in the USA is 50 years out of date in 2012. We need to get rid of pennies altogether (Canada did) and get a dollar coin, a two dollar coin, and a five dollar coin. Why can't we do that?!

Agree on the roundabouts. We have a few here now, they work well and save gas as when it is clear you don't need to stop. Many accidents occur in 4 way stops because people in the USA are too stupid to know how to use them. And then there are the 5 way stops - please avoid them.

We have booze in supermarkets here in Washington State. 

Use an adapter for the older plugs. You can attach them to the socket with a screw, or just use them without.

Hayes was due to appear at Wirral Magistrates Court last week, but failed to attend.

A warrant was then issued for his arrest and police arrived at his home in Holland Road, Wallasey, on Saturday morning and took him to the court.

A spokesman for Merseyside Police confirmed their officers arrested businessman Hayes and transported him to Wirral Magistrates Court.
At the same court on Monday July 2 he was committed to prison for 21 days for arrears and costs of £1,477.14 and “wilful refusal” to pay.

true,Philomathematic,hartnell,Hartnell,"I loved ""Dalek"" because it was an early acknowledgement of the show's past, with a nod towards the idea that perhaps things can change - an important theme for the Ninth Doctor as well as, I'm sure, the public opinion of the new Who. And the finale of series one is still my favorite end to a series thus far. The frequency with which the Daleks continued to recur started to bother me somewhere around the third season, though. On the other hand, I'm also looking forward to their reappearance. I think they should be used sparingly, not every time the Doctor needs to face a serious threat, but some of the times. It's like having the Joker be the *only* villain iconic enough to really bother Batman.

However, I do wish the new series would work on cultivating some new iconic villains. The Weeping Angels are excellent, but have fairly limited potential for continued interesting stories, particularly since their whole gimmick is that they can't be interacted with. Same goes for a lot of the other monsters created by Moffat - the Vashta Nerada and the Silents both work because we can't straight up fight them, which is creepy and cool, but doesn't lend itself to too many story arcs. The Silence as an organization has a lot of potential, I think, but it needs to be developed a lot further before we know for sure.",0,1341454021,null,0,false,0,c59jy5v,t3_w20fn,t1_c59jy5v,t3_w20fn,null,1429298500,19,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,19

As for Amy, he loves the name Pond. His only problem with her name is that she's no longer named Amelia.

He works it out on a case by case basis, rather than going by gender.

Also, I think it's canon that Timelords can regenerate as the opposite sex, so I don't think they have a naming custom like that.

EDIT: Yep, Timelords can regenerate as the other gender: [Later, in the fourth episode of the series, ""The Doctor's Wife"", it was stated that Time Lords can potentially change gender during a regeneration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_%28Doctor_Who%29#In_the_series)

EDIT 2: [Apparently, the only way a Time Lord can regenerate as a member of the opposite sex is to commit suicide.
