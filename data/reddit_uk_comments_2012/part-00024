true,zumzink,null,null,"I understand your frustration at a lack of rigid structure, and you make a good point that without some sort of rule set within the world-building the writers could get lazy. However I think you may be misunderstanding  the show itself. 

It's not hard sci-fi, nor does it ever pretend to be. It's really a character show that explores concepts of humanity through the use of a sci-fi device (time travel and aliens). The time travel adds adventure and mystery, and sometimes social commentary, to keep things lively. But the time travel is there as a supporting element to character exploration and development.

As such, the specific details of how the TARDIS and time travel work become much less relevant when you're engaged with the story. 

There are some rules, which are revealed as the show progresses. It's not as though the writers just chuck all quality and continuity, going willy nilly with the story structure. There's also the argument that withholding some of the specifics of how things work (a) keeps some mystery for the audience so they don't burn out after a few seasons, and (b) allows the writers enough freedom to expand the world in the future.",0,1330560089,null,0,false,0,c3web9u,t3_qbn88,t1_c3web9u,t1_c3wbdrg,null,1428444564,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

true,sostopher,tennant,Tennant,"&gt;When there are sudden problems/threats, why does the Doctor not just travel to a point before everything gets messy and deals with it then.

Because he can't cross his own timeline. He has to remain relative to the causal nexus.

&gt;Why does Rose have to leave her mother and boyfriend behind, when she could just visit every few weeks at a moment that would be a day after she left them?

The TARDIS doesn't always work as desired as you saw in Aliens of London.

&gt;How can they visit different times when they undertake actions that would change how things turn out? For example, the Doctor showed Rose the end of the Earth, a point in time where all humans have left the planet and gone on to other projects. Then humankind is barely saved from extinction in the next episode, saved by the Doctor and Rose. There was no chance of failure because they already know humans will get to the point of space traveling at some point.

Time can be re-written. Some things are meant to happen and always happen. Some things can happen, some things must not. The Doctor knows this. This is the curse of the Timelords.

Stop looking for the rules and enjoy it.

Think about some episodes of Star Trek (pick a series). There will be an episode where they will do something once and it works.

Particularly the now strange 4-part breakup in a 1 hour block. Just when you're getting into it the section ends, then you have the disruption of the end credits, then further disruption of the next intro credits, then you get back to the story that was awkwardly paced to begin with.

I actually like classic tv shows and movies, but sometimes the early stuff from the 60s (particularly the black and white) is just plain painful due to the pacing. The sound and image quality are much poorer as well. Sometimes you're more enduring the episodes than watching them. Largely that's due to the [budget constraints at the time](http://io9.com/5886666/the-creators-of-doctor-who-were-a-scandal), limiting both the camera work and the sets -- which in turn limited the story lines. 

If you're going to tackle the original eps I think you have to sort of prep yourself (even for the 70s and 80s stuff): 

* be prepared for campy masks and effects
* tune out the campy-ness so you can get past it
* turn off any modern racial sensitivity you have
* turn off any modern feminist sensitivity you have
* concentrate on The Doctor and the plot

Interesting aside: Do you know why the old reactor halls are blue and white striped? Apparently it was to minimise the impact the towers would have by blending in with the horizon.

The cancer thing sounds like the usual anti-nuclear scaremongering to me. Barring a serious leak there's no way for radioactive material from the station to get in to the river.

It's perhaps slick, but skin deep, and one should realise that there is a Rothschild executive sitting above The Guardian amongst other well-monied sorts.

I'd even speculate this is a direct counter to Wikileaks and the PR fiasco regarding their exploitation and the consequential spin concerning the undeniably biased film, incidentally, also aired and paid for by Channel4 last year. The film is currently under formal investigation by OFCOM. Details can be found [here](http://mmcetera.blogspot.com/2012/02/continued-controversy-over-wikileaks.html), and it is not pretty for this 'noble' publication:

&gt; The meeting on Nov.1, 2011 was #SPIEGEL 's attempt to bring #Wikileaks and Guardian and NYT back on the table. to avoid a public disaster.

&gt; We spoke about this point extensively with the filmmaker. Unfortunately he did cut it out. #wikileaks #cablegate

https://redbrickblog.wordpress.com/2012/02/16/how-the-policy-exchange-gets-it-wrong/

&gt;the influence which the think tank Policy Exchange has on government policy, which prompted me to wonder if its reputation is deserved.  Certainly on economic policy it has come a cropper, since it confidently predicted in August 2010 that the necessarily heavy spending cuts and recession would be quickly followed by a ‘big boom’, in which growth through most of 2011 will be ‘the strongest seen in the UK since the 1980s’.  Probably not even George Osborne expected that to happen.

&gt;Also published in August 2010, its policy paper Making Housing Affordable was more cautious in its forecasts and notably gloomy in its analysis of social housing.  Perhaps it was more responsible than any other think tank paper of that time – although there was heavy competition from Localis – for promoting the view that social housing was an out-and-out failure, devoting page after page to making its dreary case.

&gt;However, it faced an inconvenient truth, which was that demand for this failed tenure was at an all-time high.  It tackled this by arguing that it is purely and simply high house prices that push up demand for social housing and therefore that waiting lists would cease to grow if prices were flat. So ‘stabilising house prices and supporting home-ownership will… eliminate(e) social housing waiting lists over time’ (p.42).",0,1330568042,null,0,false,0,c3wfsj1,t3_qb2l3,t1_c3wfsj1,t3_qb2l3,null,1428445237,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,palehorse864,null,null,"While I doubt the whole of the war could be shown, it would be awesome to see some key skirmishes. We saw part of it in The End of Time, with Dalek saucers littering the surface of Gallifrey around the citadel as Rassilon laments the Time Lock.

We can say that it should never be portrayed on screen, but in a way, it already has to varying degrees, depending upon your interpretation of classic Dalek episodes. There are a few scenes I would like to see.

* The Doctor trying to reason with Rassilon before realizing that he's gone off the deep end.  

* The Doctor moving through the citadel and stealing The Moment before getting into his TARDIS and taking off.  

* The Doctor recalling one of his titles ""Protector of Gallifrey"" from his 7th incarnation, and pondering what he is about to do before finally turning the key.  

* The actual injury that causes 8 to regenerate. I've imagined eight standing in the TARDIS and turning the key, fully expecting to die with his people. The force of the inferno blows open the doors and the Doctor is tossed violently against the TARDIS console as a blast of fire enters the control room.  The Doctor falls unconscious and severely injured on the floor as Eight's long locks of hair are singed from the tips, burning almost like a fuse to the scalp, more in keeping with Eccleston's short hair style. This could also explain why 9/10's regenerations were so violently firey. 7 was shocked with a defibrillator and gave off electrical energy when regenerating. The same could have happened from the inferno that destroyed Gallifrey and Skaro. 

* They should almost certainly steer away from the disappearance or death of classic companions. They're all presumed dead, but who wants to see Romana or Susan die on screen really? I always picture Susan twisting her ankle and falling into a ravine. :) Her pretzel thin ankles were finally her undoing (Though falling off a cliff is the classic way to kill a character who isn't really dead). 

We at least have enough hints to get a pretty accurate guess of some scenes. The Daleks mentioned that the war ended in an inferno, we saw that Daleks had invaded Gallifrey.  The biggest issue would be coming up with some Timelord weaponry. What took down those Dalek saucers?

I'm not putting it into words too well, but you get what I mean.

It's been the same for me with the other Doctors (especially Tennant), save for Eccleston. He left the show well before he became typecast in my brain like the other guys (I'm not saying his Doctor was crappy, 9 is one of my favourites).

I saw Cumberbatch in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy a couple weeks back and it was terribly difficult to reimagine him as anyone but Sherlock.

That all said and done, to avoid eating my words 6 minutes after writing them, I'd be much happier seeing him as the Doctor than the Master.

One thing I've noticed originating from the North is the more depressed an area, the more betting shops there are, people see it ( like the pools coupons, premium bonds and now the lottery ) as a way of getting out. To dream the dream. 

Trouble is though ( and I've come across many hardened Northern gamblers in my time ) it becomes an addiction, the more they win, the more they bet and that can seriously rip families apart. I had a mate who used to spend everything he earned on the various betting machines down the local bookies, it was his life. Sadly though it cost him his marriage, he even sacrificed the kids presents one Christmas just so he could play these machines. Damn do I remember the rows he had with his wife and his own insane justification of what he was doing. The Christmas thing was the final straw, he came back one day and she'd cleaned the house out. 

Lend us a tenner?

 Fuck off, you still owe me £30. 

Nah, lend us a tenner, I tell you what I've cracked the code on this new machine, I've been watching it for two days, it's ready to pay out. I'll give you the £40 + £30 extra.

true,fuggerdug,null,null,"This is bullshit, plain and simple.  The argument goes:  I am an entrepeneur, I run a business and thus create jobs. I pay myself handsomely (more than £150K a year) and the income tax on my earnings above £150K is hurting me so much, I no longer want to make any more money, and thus wont employ anyone else.  I am an entrepeneur and risk my own money on this, and it's just not fair.  

Aside from the nonsense idea that hitting a higher rate of tax on earnings means you no longer get any benefit from those additional earnings, which if true would mean that these people would have given up when they hit the 40% rate at ~£44K, there is a glaringly obvious flaw here:

NOBODY IN THAT POSITION IS PAYING INCOME TAX AND NI ABOVE A BASIC SALARY.

Why?  Because they own the business, if they are genuine entrepenuers (which is always what is claimed for anyone in this position) then they would pay themselves a dividend rather than PAYE,  usually in a lump sum at the end of the financial year.  This would attract divident tax~~corporation tax (currently at 25%)~~.  EDIT: from wikipedia:
*In the United Kingdom, companies pay UK corporation tax on their profits and the remainder can be paid to shareholders as dividends. Basic rate tax payers have no further tax to pay as the dividend is deemed to have been received net of 10% tax. For middle-rate taxpayers, additional tax must be paid at 25% of the net dividend received (32.5% less the 10% deemed tax deduction, calculated on the deemed gross payment of the dividend). Highest-rate taxpayers (above 150.000 £ yearly) must pay a 36.1% tax on the net dividend received.*

This is not tax avoidance, or tax evasion.  It is not complicated, it is just the most obvious thing to do.  
Any accountant would tell you to do it.  Even any accountancy books in the library or quick research on the internet will tell you to do it.

The only people likely to be in the upper tax bracket (&gt; £150K a year) on income tax are salaried staff e.g. senior management at middle to large companies.  These people are NOT entrepeneurs!  They are not risking their own money, they are just in a salaried job.  The only risk they they encounter is the risk of losing their job due to poor performace, the same as anybody else.  In fact, that risk is lessened when compared to the average because they often have termination clauses within their contracts granting payoffs in the event of termination.

The way that slot machine works is that they have a programmed ratio. So in NZ it was 0.92 or 0.93 I believe. 

This means that every £100, the machine would spit out £92 or £93. The higher the ratio is, the more addictive it is - especially if it gets close to 0.96 or 0.97. 

Due to the addictiveness of a high return it is illegal for the ratio to be 0.96 or 0.97. However I believe that the ratios in Vegas are legally at 0.97.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Nope, they pay for the service delivered, they don't pay for the creation of it or delivery of it.  
  
When costs change, price invariably follows.  The costs of production (in this case the cost of education) form a part of the price of any good or service.  When I pay a lawyer or an accountant for their services, I am paying a portion of their university fees in the same way that when I buy a bottle of lemonade, I am paying a portion of the land rents, the building maintenance, the shop staff's wages, the delivery van's fuel, and so on.  The price of one unit factors in every cost all the way down the chain.  
  
&gt;If your logic worked then they would not demand bilateral agreements with us to stop us taking their top talent in critical areas such as health care. They would say - they overwhelming bulk of the benefit goes to the individual so let them go.  
  
Brain drain is a different issue, and those people are going to leave the country regardless of who is paying for their education.  Yes, of course it's better to have a more highly-educated society, and of course it's better to encourage people with a high skill level to stay.  I'm not arguing against that at all.  But that has nothing to do with which funding model is the most appropriate for university education.  
  
When I talk about the benefit accruing mostly to the graduate, I'm not saying that society doesn't gain by having access to highly educated people; I'm saying that those highly educated people are the ones to reap the *financial* reward from their education.  And when you collectively fund university education, you pay twice and the graduate gains twice.  It's fundamentally inequitable to socialise costs while privatising gains.  
  
&gt;When those people then go on to receive payment for that talent - the country then also gains tax revenues from that service being paid for - it benefits from the economic activity that that person generates.  
  
You can't just say 'graduates pay more tax' as an argument for tax funding of university education.  You have to look at the actual outcomes under the two different systems to use the Income Tax gains as an argument, because graduates under a largely privately funded system also pay more tax.  
  
Let's assume that a university course costs, on average, £6k a year, and that each graduate brings in an average of £50k extra taxes over their lifetime.  If we collectively fund all university courses, that's a gain of £32k per lifetime per graduate.  I'm absolutely not denying that the tax gain for collectively funding university is higher than the tax cost; it's clearly more than self funding.  I will add, however, that it's the people who paid for the education who are then paying the graduate the money that ends up as taxes.  Again they're paying twice, but this time it's to the government.  
  
But what happens under the new system, where the graduate repays some/most/all of that £6k a year in loan repayments or graduate tax?  
  
Assuming that even just 25% of the total course fees are eventually recovered, that would increase the average tax gain per graduate to £36.5k - an increase of 14% per lifetime per graduate.  Admissions would have to fall by more than that amount for the net tax gains to be higher under a collectively funded system.  
  
Given that more than 25% is likely to be repaid, that applications are only down [around 7%](http://www.ucas.com/about_us/media_enquiries/media_releases/2012/20120228), and that many universities are oversubscribed to start with (so *admissions* are likely to fall by less than 7%), it seems fair to conclude that, at least on the face of things, the net tax gain will actually be higher under the new, largely privately funded system.  
  
&gt;An education system, especially a university system that is world class makes a country world class. The evidence is overwhelming.  
  
I completely agree with this, but collectively funding the system does not magically make it world class.  I think that the current UK system is a truly excellent blend of using private funding for private benefit, while still maintaining some collective funding to minimise the level of risk, thus reducing financial barriers to entry.",0,1330601282,null,0,true,0,c3wk42f,t3_q9y8b,t1_c3wk42f,t1_c3wdl9d,null,1428447260,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I fully accept that - in theory - a democratically elected head of state is the least-bad option for any government (there are no good governments, just less bad ones).

However, if you were to ask me what the benefit would be, other than the emotional knowledge that the President is directly elected instead of having a Monarchy with an indirect mandate by virtue of the population not electing a government to replace it...

...then I would shrug my shoulders and say ""I really can't think of one"".

Emotionally, people simply tend to like the current system, and any political party that stands on a mandate to abolish the Monarchy fails to get elected. The people are given the choice of replacing the Monarch, and they reject it.

If you look around the world, there are very few Presidents that hold the same emotional sway over a country as the British Monarchy does over the British people. Again, you can suggest that people are deluded by that, but most of us base our decisions to some degree on emotions instead of clinical facts.

* They act as the ambassadors-in-chief for the government, they are a useful tool in foreign policy.
* In the multicultural society which we have, it's nice to have a constant reminder of the past and of our history.
* If we got rid of the monarchy, our Parliamentary system would require some replacement head-of-state anyway, who is to say the cost of the maintenance of the new head of state would be less than that of the present monarchy?
* Tourism. Everyone cites this as a reason, I know.
* They inspire non-political, healthy, nationalism.
* The fact that they are an inherently undemocratic institution is moot when you consider the de facto powers of the monarchy.
* Once we lose the monarchy, it's gone forever.
* The Crown protects religious freedom in the UK through being the head of the church of the country, yet not really asserting the religious authority which comes with the position. 
* The fact that we have a monarchy set up, traditionally autocrats, means that in order to set up another autocracy the abolition of the monarchy would be required. In effect, having a monarchy means that Britain's autocrat-slot is already occupied, which in a perverse way helps to protect our democracy. (Can you imagine a British Hitler being OK with the Crown?) (Sorry for invoking Godwin's law...)

It’s also just not true that all methods of tax avoidance are taking advantage of loopholes intentionally left in taxation legislation – the are loopholes unintentionally left in legislation. Given that, there’s a really strong argument that taking advantage of loopholes unintentionally left in legislation is going against the intention of parliament, broadly construed. As such, there is a clear case for saying it’s immoral (in that it frustrates the democratically determined will of the people of the UK).

Thats just plain wrong, theres any number of reasons why genuine entrepreneurs might take salaries instead of dividends.

&gt;Why? Because they own the business, if they are genuine entrepenuers (which is always what is claimed for anyone in this position) then they would pay themselves a dividend rather than PAYE, usually in a lump sum at the end of the financial year. This would attract only corporation tax (currently at 25%). 

Completely wrong again. A dividend is affected by corporation tax and then a dividend tax rate. At the same time as the 50p rate came in an equivalent rate for dividends over 150k came in (42.5%)

While its rarely mentioned specifically I assume that when the 50p rate is abolished then the top dividend rate will go too.

With the early Bar X machines in the 90's with a certain mix of reels if you got a hold and held the left X it'd drop XXX and then it'd start a win sequence.

Cloud 9 and ones based on the same board and PROMS in the 90's were well known for it. If you watched them long enough you'd recognise when the sequence had started. You'd get something like a win, lose, win, lose, lose, win, win, lose, hold, lose, hold, jackpot. Someone watching you play would look for that streak starting. 
We eventually coined the name ""vulturing"" for people watching others play to identify the win streaks.
That happens less and less now TBH and there are independent companies who release ""fixed"" ROMS for machines.

The thing that happens now though is just outright theft such as putting wire rods up the chutes on certain machines to short out the triacs on the main PCB near the chute to trigger the solenoids at the bottom of the coin tube. 

[If you watch this security video of a mates, you'll see three guys robbing some machines.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n8AXJif00c) On this machine the pound coins are in a rotating hopper. They push something up the chute that jams a microswitch open which counts the coins being paid out. They then play the machine, get a win and the machine punts out coins until its empty because as far as it is concerned, none have come out.

There are loads and loads of things they use and its a constant battle between the thieves and the arcade operators.

true,TeleSavalas,eng-Eastanglia,South East,"&gt;I more or less am in this position. Generally a business owner would take this money in the form of dividend, as it's far more tax efficient.

Dividends have a new upper band over 150k that was bought in with the 50p rate, if the 50p rate goes then that will more than likely go too. Dividends are really not that much better than small salary + bonus becuase youre getting hit with corporation tax too.

&gt;Are the people you have spoken to generally sole traders? I can understand this strategy for them, but if you're a shareholder you'd always go for dividends.

No, a wide range some of them brands you would recognise.

&gt;Why bonuses and dividends together? They are taxed very differently. Only bonuses are subject to income tax

This was meant in the way they were both options taken by different people in response to this situation.

&gt;You really need to speak to more accountants then (certainly mine would disagree). This only makes sense (that I can see :) for sole traders and partnerships.

You're account would disagree? He would suggest that you take out a large sum of money now rather than betting on a removal of the upper band?

It sounds like you're not aware of the upper dividend band or of exactly how tax effiecient dividends are. 
EDIT: Just seen one of your comments below, you seem to think that CGT applies to dividends at 28%? I think you're the one in need of a new accountant ;)

I obviously don't have any experience of any other course specialised or not, but I think the ""oxford way"" is not so much to study everything in ridiculous depth but rather give you a good enough footing in a large subject field to work out the little details for yourself (a.k.a the art of bullshitting). The pace is a lot faster than anywhere else so you tend to skim a lot of the work but there is no reason you can't focus on something that takes your fancy in your spare time -- if you have any. There is a lot of overlap between specialisms so it now seems a little strange to think that you could study one without the other.  But like I said, the fact that you aren't just studying the same subject in massive detail constantly makes it a lot more interesting and the chances are you will find something that you like better than straight EE, even if it is a combination of other disciplines, just because you wouldn't have come across it before.

The point here is to make it illegal for financial institutes within the well regulated zone to hold potentially toxic financial assets from the unregulated zone. I.E. we won't allow companies to export their bad debt in a way that means they are still dependent on it but the EU won't benefit from it.

It really does not matter if they split the company in two provided that the assets that regulated institutes depend upon is sound.

Companies in the EU won't have trouble raising funds. You have the balance of power backwards. We control the market. They need our accent to operate in it. They want to operate in it and if they don't then someone else will. If we allow them to operate in it without upholding our regulations then they'll happily do so. That is why you make it so they can't do so.

The BRICs are irrelevant. For the most part they don't have a service industry that can benefit from financial services. They could only benefit if companies were allowed to move there for tax purposes while trading in the service economies. Something we're going to explicitly disallow. They can move there and not have access to the market that will actually make money.

The only reason it would be difficult is it runs against the international global economic consensus of the past 10 years. In reality it is impossible to have safe banking and a global market unless everyone agrees on sound regulation. If we get bad actors then the only sensible thing to do is exclude them rather than taking part in a race to the bottom.

Given a choice between the EU and the BRICs the US will always choose the EU as a trading partner but the EU has to be prepared to use that leverage to get what it wants. It isn't as if the BRICs are going to refuse to sell us the cheap crap that they are renown for.

Laffer and the 50p rate :

http://www.answers.com/topic/smoot-hawley-tariff

&gt;At a party in the late 1970s—or so the story goes—economist Arthur Laffer used a cocktail napkin to sketch an upside-down U that became the basis for an entire movement in economic policy. The Laffer Curve, as the U came to be known, represented the theory that as taxes went down, government revenue would actually go up, as lower taxes would stimulate the economy and provide more receipts. Laffer's theory was adopted as part of Ronald Reagan's platform in his 1980 presidential campaign, and after he became president, Reagan pushed through the largest package of tax cuts in history. Counter to his expectations, the deficit mushroomed, and Laffer's theory was discredited. While most scholars agreed that a budget deficit would grow by slightly less than the full amount of a tax cut, because some economic growth would result, credible economists from across the political spectrum agreed that the net effect would be negative. During the 1980 presidential primaries, Reagan's opponent George H. W. Bush had ridiculed his theories as ""voodoo economics."" Twenty years later, Bush's son, President George W. Bush, promoted another package of enormous tax cuts, arguing that they would stimulate the economy, government receipts would increase, and the budget gap would be closed. Bush's detractors, who viewed the maneuver as blatant pandering to wealthy constituents, called it voodoo economics all over again.

http://leap-lrc.blogspot.com/2012/02/having-laffer.html

&gt;However, the Laffer Curve is not a tool solely of the right. Toby Young - a man whose knowledge and arrogance seem to have an inverse relationship - obviously hasn't read much about the Laffer Curve. If he had he might not be advocating a 70% taxation rate. That according to Mathias Trabandt &amp; Harald Uhlig in 'How far are we from the slippery slope: The Laffer Curve revisited' is the income tax rate after which revenues start declining.

and

&gt;So, if we could effectively cap salaries at £300,000 (and therefore also reduce the ridiculous pension pots to the super-rich) that money could then be spent more productively - on research and development, or improving the wages or working conditions of general employees. Then the right would cry that British business could not compete. But the German Commerzbank caps its top pay at 500,000 euros or £416,000 - about one-third of what Stephen Hester will receive as his basic salary, even without his now defunct bonus.

http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2011/09/07/should-the-50p-tax-rate-be-abolished/

&gt;It’s also true that while the UK undoubtedly needs tax cuts to stimulate the economy, a cut in the 50% tax rate is probably the least likely to do this. Cutting it will boost savings, of which we already have a glut, or house prices in the south-east, which are already too high. There’s little or no chance it will stimulate spending.

&gt;Nor will it boost entrepreneurship, which is about people taking risks and creating companies. Most people earning £150,000 a year do neither. They speculate for banks and pension funds using other people’s money (where, let it be noted, most have been so successful that their average rate of return in the last decade has been about zero at best) or they rise through the ranks of multinational corporations, enjoying secure employment and large pensions until appointed to positions where they can distort pay and rewards in their own favour. As a result their main contribution to society is, in fact, to increase the income and wealth gaps, which we know produces worse outcomes for all.

&gt;So that’s not entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship which leads to growth, new business and new jobs is done in small companies by people who often work for long periods for nothing (and so pay little or no tax). Their income is usually sheltered in companies – and those companies only pay tax at about 20%. The 50% tax rate is no disincentive to real entrepreneurship.

&gt;So how, exactly, did Laffer get it wrong? It's very simple, really. Laffer's findings were caused by population growth in the high-growth states, not by economic growth stimulated by tax cuts (and incidentally, that population growth had nothing to do with tax cuts either). And that's it, really. There are a few other factors, too: some of the states, for instance, were able to afford tax cuts because they had large natural resource windfalls.

&gt;And oh dear, there really is a big error in the claim made: to suggest that talent and remuneration is correlated is, shall we say, just a little bit of an error? There are extraordinarily talented people in this country making a lot less than £150,000 a year. Most of those who are making £150,000 are either in finance (making sure that pensions funds have generated no net return for their members over the last decade or more, for example – one of the weirdest definitions of growth I know and and also one of the strangest definitions of talent) or are in senior management of major multinational corporations where there is no proven link between talent and return

Being 'raped' is becoming a catchphrase yes, but only amongst those completely unaffected by the issue and use of it tends to be most popular among male teenagers. 'Fucked' and 'shafted' aren't so much of a slap in the face. Once again, thanks for being gracious about this (not being sarcastic here.)

So, I went and asked him. No, he doesn't think he pays too much tax, although he object to how it is spent - for example, he thinks Trident is a boondoggle we can't afford.

He strongly believes a social safety net should be in place. He thinks the current set up for benefits is being used to make a few people rich - *not* people receiving benefits, but top executives in companies like ATOS. 

He doesn't like big government and considers himself a social libertarian. He supports several disabled people as it is, where the social safety net has failed them and objects to the government setting a 'minimum needed to live on' and then giving them less than that while they appeal their claim. He thinks disabled people get it rough under the current system. He'd rather have a more bare-bones system with less complexity even if it meant that some people got more money they didn't strictly *need* to live on. He doesn't think JSA is set too high or is too easy to get. He doesn't want more socialism where everyone puts in and everyone gets out. 

He does wish the NHS covered dentistry but thinks a two-tier system should be in place for non-emergent, non-life-saving care such as facial reconstruction and long term mental health management, where poor people get as much out of the NHS as they ever did but rich people (like himself) have to pay or get private insurance to cover it. He thinks that the current setup of preventative care, public health and GPs is adequate but needs more funding. 

He thinks 40% is not too much tax, and that the 50% rate is barely going to effect anyone unless they're really very rich so who cares. He considers himself *very* well off and is glad that he can use it to help people worse off than him, but he wouldn't want to pay more tax on what he earns now because he doesn't trust our government to use it well. He wishes that people with non-earning dependants paid a lot less tax as a percentage but thinks that the old married tax allowance was worse than what we have now - I think partly because he's a strong supporter of gay marriage and multiple-partner or extended families, but I was starting to lose track of what he'd said and ended the conversation before asking why.",0,1330616189,null,0,false,0,c3wlmfe,t3_qcpf4,t1_c3wlmfe,t1_c3wl3hk,null,1428448117,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,SMTRodent,eng-nottinghamshire,Back in Nottnum,"Nope - I'm from a rough housing estate in Nottingham, child of an alcoholic single parent and was able to work only for a short time before illness and disability stripped my job away from me and left me relying on benefits. I'd rather have been working because I genuinely loved being a lab tech - if I could get back into the lab I would, despite the fact the pay is appalling.

Since then, I had a couple of years where I could work, although only part time, and I paid tax and found it to be not a huge burden to me. My spouse also hasn't always been in work, although we've not needed benefits since then - I do actually qualify now for DLA at the full rate but the stress of applying isn't worth the money when I don't *need* the money because the alternative is starvation or residential care.

I'm kept in touch with how much things cost by getting an allowance and paying back bills and rent out of it. Tax comes out of *our* income and affects me, even if I can't earn money myself. Since I've benefited from the social safety net, I've never objected to paying into it, not even when I was actually earning my keep.

The fact that housing prices are so high *is* something we actually agree on. House prices are stupid, house prices in London are absurd. I think we need a lot more social housing to take the pressure off - social housing means fewer poor people in privately rented houses, which means more privately rented houses are available for less poor people. However, wanting something that's artificially high in price and not being able to have it doesn't make you poor if no one else around you can afford it either, and the answer to stupid house prices isn't lower tax rates.

I'm not sure what point you're trying to make about JSA, really. I think that you're angry that people can live on it indefinitely? But you could do the same. Or the fact that they didn't earn their keep and could have? 

There are people in genuine penury under the same system, and the fraud rate on benefits is less than the fraud rate on income tax, so making it *more* difficult to get doesn't seem to be the answer - the fraud rate is already very, very low.

2)This was supposed to be a pilot episode. So when you see certain things get brought up, and then never mentioned again(Half human), keep in mind that they were meant to be brought up later.

Also, with that in mind, the half human bit was explained in the comic The Forgotten that the Doctor was using the chameleon arch to make himself half human.

3)The intro is very half hearted, and kind of gets it wrong. It's much better explained in the books. Before the movie begins The Master has found a way to prolong his life(once again), and has begun working alongside the Daleks. When the Daleks realize that The Master is planning to double cross them, they hold a 'trial' against him and decide to exterminate him. As a last plea, he sends a psychic message to The Doctor, not to rescue him, but to rescue his remains from Skaro so that he may be buried on Galifrey. Having grown up with The Master, and remembering that they weren't always enemies, he decides to abide by The Master's last wishes. The movie does a *horrible* job conveying this.

All in all, I don't think it's that bad of a movie, all things considered. It probably could have used a cleaner editing job, and the replacement of Will Sasso, but other than that it's not bad. I don't think it would have been so highly disregarded had it actually spawned its own series. One of the big things people complain about is that it ruined continuity/canon(Such as with the half human bit), but honestly, I think RTD screwed with canon way worse at moments.  Hell, imagine if all you had to go off of New Who was The End of Time, and got to see The Master resurrected as a Sith Lord.",0,1330622291,null,0,false,0,c3wmq14,t3_qbsyo,t1_c3wmq14,t1_c3wj95s,null,1428448629,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Tesco have deeper pockets and better lawyers than the local council who is responsible for the planning application. They have experience in knowing what rules and regulations they can get away with ignoring. Objection to a Tesco must be organised by inexperienced local volunteers, and the local council is funded by public money, with incumbents who may flip-flop or simply be replaced by an election during the planning process or who may not even still live in the town by the time the store is built. Tesco have a unified single purpose - they're looking at profits over a 20 - 30 year period, in the order of millions of pounds a year per store.

If Tesco is told it can't do something, it can afford to just do it anyway, safe in the knowledge that it could tie up the local council in court for years - the council is not in a position just to knock down the store for non-compliance.

Football violence or antagonism is common place (I believe) and the police and authorities are always on the look out to reduce this. It would appear that in certain areas the religion of opposing teams can cause tension, so a way to combat violence etc. might be to restrict talk or chants about religion, and thus avoid arguments or fights.

I'm not sure there's any good reason to criticise this legislation. Religion itself isn't being restricted, at least not the observance of religion. Similar to the indigence over council prayers, it would be misplaced: neither the council chamber nor the football field are specified places of religious worship.

I'm somewhat confused by your worry though - How is religion being given legal protection here? Unless you're of the opinion that the fans are being denied the right to criticise a religion, having their right of free speech restricted? Personally I can't take that worry seriously, as the only reason to criticise/poke fun at religion at a football match etc. I can see would be to antagonise the opposition (excluding people praying for their team to win, but that's not exactly going to be shouted at the opposition). It's not exactly a blow for intellectual freedom by stopping fans from trying to start fights.

It isn't true. An ISA, for instance, is not a loophole. The government does not create loopholes to exploit, they are the result of incomplete and badly crafted legislation. An example would be the old practice of moving profits offshore to avoid paying tax on profits made in the UK. That was something that was not foreseen when the rules were created. When it began to get widely exploited, the law was changed so that all UK companies must pay tax on all profits they make worldwide.

 We have a system in this country whereby loopholes like that are supposed to be gradually patched when they are exploited. That's why many believe it is a complicated tax system in need of reform. Other countries opt for the far better solution of a GAAR, which doesn't create laws to fill loopholes, as they just make it illegal to exploit any loopholes that exist, now or in the future.

true,Mondoshawan,null,null,"&gt; It's not guaranteed, nor is there any code to force this

That's completely untrue I'm afraid. The machines have no randomness whatsoever. The CPU decides what the reels will stop on as it starts spinning them up. ""Average payouts"" are programmed, they are not a result of statistical randomness. The owner can often change the payout rate via dip switches and/or service menus. 

This has been proven via de-compiled source code from real machines. They also cheat, for example changing the reel outcome on high/low games depending on what the played selected. This can be replicated in an emulator which allows you to save the state of the machine and replay different choices with alternate guesses. 

If it's a networked system then the average payout is spread across the machines, making watching them pointless. Stand-alone machines don't do that and are ""due a payout"" at times. There are a number of means to determine this. One is to know the machine well enough to determine the sound of a coin drop. If it goes into the prize hopper then it's building up it's bank and is unlikely to paying out much at that time. If it goes into the ""take"" hopper then the bank is full and a payout is much more likely.

&gt; It's the same as buying more lottery tickets when there's a big jackpot on

This has been done successfully with both lottery ball draws and scratchcards. One group in the US for example knew when the best time to buy scrathcards was, because the number of big prizes in circulation tipped the odds in their favour. In short the card issuers had a flaw in their printing algorithm that was reverse-engineered then exploited.

That is a very narrow view of how big business works. There isn't an innocent relationship between the rational consumer evaluating the merits of different products and services in a calm and logical manner and the company which just wants to seek the best way to please their clients. 

Big business uses mass psychology, economic power, influence over politicians and the will to bully suppliers to gain their place in the market. 

&gt;You also don't understand what 'neo-con' means if you think that the Guardian is a neo-com newspaper. Personally, my opinions do not align with those of that paper - it's the paradigmatic Guardian reader type who thinks it's 'ethical' to rack up carbon emissions with organic vegetable delivery, and to stop poor people buying food at the price they want to.

You described yourself as a Guardian reader to distinguish yourself from a pro-business righty type of person. 

in general I think our mainstream politics are closer to neo-conservatism than anything else and the press covers very narrow ground between the Mail and the Grauniad however, I thought it would be obvious enough I was using hyperbole.

Any statement taken out of context can be made to sound offensive. What I suspect happened in the interview was Luiz was asked about Lampard and he tried to deflect the question. When pressed, he tried to give a generic response using generic terms. However, since the response was made in context to the question about Lampard, the context was automatically assumed to be Lampard. Here's how I imagine it must have happened:

INTERVIEWER: Blah, blah, blah, Lampard, blah, blah, blah? 

DL: Well, all football players are professionals and no different from employees at a company. If the Manager says you have to do something, you have to do it - there can be no two ways about it. 

Now, read the last line and ONLY the last line of the above conversation. See what I mean? 

The problem with the whole thing is you can't not talk to the media and you can't be too careful when you do. If you keep silent or evade questions, your silence and/or evasiveness is considered open to interpretation and the results of that are often much worse.

My argument would be that this less than effective tax was designed as a vote winner because, as brilliantly proved by much of the rhetoric on this subreddit as a whole, and even on this very page the demonizing of anyone successful is fairly widespread in the UK. Driving away those entrepreneurs, businessmen and, even bankers will do nothing for the economy, even if it does make those worse off feel a little better. More people will either avoid the tax or simply be driven away, which is good for no one.

I think Torres fits a lot better into our lineup than Carroll does. Instead of quick passes and diagonal runs, our ""strategy"" seems to be to run it down the wing and smash it into the box hoping Andy gets his head on it. I think that if we want to compete for top four, we really need a much better plan than that.

1. Sorry, no idea on this one

2. Yes, they are quantum locked. In the episode *The Time of Angels* in Series 5, Amy looks at a video feed of an angel. The angel begins to come to life and Amy shuts off the feed, but the angel stays on. According to a reference book owned by River Song, ""Whatever takes the image of an Angel becomes itself an Angel"". So while the mirror holds the image of an angel, it is an angel. 

3.  No, they would not become free. They not only become quantum locked when observed by humans, but when being observed by other angels. If they were to ""come to life"", they would be observed by each other and instantly become stone again.

I'm not 100% certain about that last one, though. In the same episode as above, there are multiple angels moving around where they would obviously observe one another, yet they only become stone when viewed by the Doctor. If anyone has answers to this, I would be most grateful.

true,zumzink,null,null,"Just from my personal experience and observation I agree that DW seems to have a large female fan base. I think that's why blogs like Doctor Her are popping up: geek women are rallying around a show that is quite progressive in its portrayal of women by current tv standards. And they want to discuss that excitement with others who feel similarly.

I also think more and more women are looking for a place to discuss the issues the show raises for them, in an environment that is not hostile or dismissive of female fans. Then there are feminists and LGBT fans who by necessity evaluate the programs they watch in that light. As well as individuals who want to improve their media literacy by better understanding the stereotypes perpetuated in tv shows, along with the positive examples and progressive strides of those shows.

I can say, without a doubt, that the primary reason I got sucked into DW (and *Warehouse 13, Eureka, Battlestar Gallactica, Once Upon A Time*) is because it frequently presents varied, 3-dimensional women and takes feminist stands. That's not because I apply a feminist agenda (whatever that means ;) ) to all entertainment, but simply because as a woman I want to see women reflected on screen -- positive women who aren't merely there to be ogled. Because seeing positive examples, or merely well-developed characters, has an important impact on our psyche. The same way that seeing negative examples, disposable 2-dimensional examples, or a lack of examples has a negative effect.

It's human nature to want to see our culture reflected and to see characters we can identify with. So it's frustrating when, as a geek woman, I have to endure sausage fests or female characters that are 2-dimensional set dressing or accessories in order to engage in the sci-fi I so love. I'm sure people who aren't straight or white feel similarly, frustrated that they don't have a variety of characters to directly identify with and rarely see people like themselves represented. And those individuals likely appreciate sites or environments that discuss those issues.

But I've always felt that it has been undermined by two points. One, that although Scotland did have a long period of independence, before the Roman invasion it was the same country as England, sharing the same culture and language, and its peoples would have been indistinguishable. Surely the Union in 1707 simply reunited these two groups, much like the fall of the Berlin wall? (stetching a metaphor there to the nth degree I know, but you get my point).

 Secondly, that after 300 years united, our cultures and peoples have become closely intertwined, and that whilst distinguishable, I don't think can be called seperate (anymore than you can seperate Yorkshire cultural differences to Cornwall). There are a large group of people with mixed Scots and English heritage, who are truly British in every sense of the word, and I think devolutionists seem to ignore their existence.

Luiz (half the season), gaitan, coentrao, luisao, javi garcia...I'm sure there is more. Porto also beat Sevilla, Villareal (by a large margin), both Moscow's (Spartak by 7 goals), and Braga. They dominated Genk in Belgium. They pretty much breezed to the treble with a squad that was very good, but just as good as many of their opponents. That Porto squad last year would have given Chelsea some real trouble.

The splash the cash fast -- cutthroat model of success worked for us in  the past and it was glorious. We all have some really special memories. However, this is not a sustainable model of success. With FFP coming we basically have no choice anyway. AVB has surely made some mistakes but he will learn. He is young, passionate, professional and intelligent. Do we honestly think he would be struggling if he had Real Madrid's squad at his disposal?

With AVB we have a chance to bring a philosophy to this club and a philosophy to our football that can be successful for decades. Not to mention we have started tailoring other parts of the clubs management to this philosophy as well. Get rid of AVB and we up heave a lot of that. There are also a lot of positives from the season despite the disappointment.

Probably more important than all that stuff is who the fuck would replace him? Hiddink? He has a job. Mourinho...more of a dream than a reality...Capello? I'd throw up. Rafa Benitez? The guy who couldn't win a premier league trophy in 6 season with a fantastic squad...No thank you.

Playing him instead of Gerrard? Unlikely.

Playing him instead of Adam (or Lucas when he returns)? 

Either you'll have to have him play out of position (holding midfielder) or play Gerrard as the holding midfielder (possibly wasting one of our best attacking assets).

I suspect he'll get his chance in midfield as Gerrard's replacement if Stevie is injured or rested.

Alternatively he might get a chance if we wind up going with 3 in the centre of midfield, with 1 holding and 2 going forward.

Currently, the best of a bad lot is to play him on the right, allow him to come inside and gain valuable playing experience.

I have to deconstruct Western civilisation for you.

As a non-retarded general citizen I can sum it up for you.

Corner shops are expensive as fuck. The only use they have is buying booze within staggering distance of your house after hours, and pringles.

With a large Tesco you can go there for pretty much anything you want, and they'll have it. If not ""it"", then something very much like it.

That's why I go there so much. Because it's become my default choice for ""I need X. Where should I go to get X?"".

I'm not stupid, I'm clever. By minimising the time I spend looking around shops, I maximise my working and leisure time. Win. I also don't give a fuck about corner shops, although of course quality butchers' and greengrocers still have their place and have remarketed as more quality and for more discerning customers than they once were.",0,1330645018,null,0,false,0,c3wr2vl,t3_qcugu,t1_c3wr2vl,t1_c3wpff5,null,1428450702,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"&gt;I wouldn't say the slapstick so much as just there being a sort of physicality to it. And the camp is one of the things that I have trouble getting over. The acting is another. It feels so flat. And I feel like knowing how the medium of television has evolved over the years, I can see the clunkiness of an old TV show.

Perhaps you'd just have to grow with it. It's like the original *Star Trek* series, what with its dramatic close-ups, strange incidental music and relatively dull acting. 

But if you have no tolerance for camp, then you probably won't get very far. I can tolerate camp (to a point, anyway), so I can still brush away the dated elements of the classic series and enjoy the stories for what they are. 

I think that's why both that *Star Trek* series and *Doctor Who* are still held in such high regard, even though the newer presentations have changed. 

&gt;Any suggestions of a good place to start with the Fourth or Fifth Doctor?

I'm not that familiar with the Fourth Doctor (believe it or not), yet. If ""the one where the Fourth Doctor is in the fog"" is *Genesis of the Daleks*, then you're probably the only person in history who didn't like that serial. It's often considered one of the best in the show's history (although I'll admit that it does run long). 

For the Fifth, I'd suggest *Resurrection of the Daleks*. His final story, *The Caves of Androzani*, is also one of the best from the show's first run. 

I can understand your not liking the visual elements of *The Three Doctors*, because the aliens were ridiculous and the special effects were poor, even by those standards. However, if you still couldn't enjoy watching the Doctors mix it up, again, that's a first. Patrick Troughton and Jon Pertwee had such great chemistry in what was a basic sci-fi story. 

The one with Seven and Ace in a haunted house is *Ghost Light*, which was actually the final produced episode of the classic series. I'm not surprised you couldn't get into it - the story was so horribly convoluted that I'm fairly convinced nobody gets it. It's good for fans of Seven and Ace, but nobody was watching *Doctor Who* at that point (hence the imminent retirement of the show), and *Ghost Light* shows it.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Downvoted for chatting absolute bollocks and attaching no figures or real knowledge to what the fuck it is you're talking about.

I won't stoop to the same level, but I see no figures nor deep understanding in either the post I was originally replying to, or indeed this one.  I would hazard that I may have a stronger foundation in economics than you do, though I can't be certain of course - you may be hiding your light under a bushel.  It's certainly true that most Marxian economists have a better grasp of mainstream economics than mainstream economists do of Marxian economics, simply because most university courses are biased towards neo-liberalism.  Instead of getting a rounded understanding of the discipline, most end up only ever hearing the economics equivalent of ""Songs of Praise"" for capitalism, rather than a scientific (even a social scientific) critique.

&gt;Look at your first quote, and point you make. 

OK, let's do that together, though the quote I was responding to was yours.  Anyway, you say:

&gt;If you want 'the full fruits of your labour', assuming this means you want the exact profit worked out that you, as an employee is making that business, assuming that would be a right estimation of putting into real terms what you mean by 'full fruits of your labour'

For everyone at an enterprise to get a full return on their efforts, yes.  The best way to achieve this would be a radically democratic control of the surplus.

&gt;In reality all this would do is, is it would make entrepreneurs in this country stop growing their businesses once it grows beyond anything they can control on their own... because there would be no more profit in it for them.

Yes, to an extent I agree.  Capitalism does contain the unwritten law, grow or die, and [exponential growth on a finite planet is one of the things which is about to send us stumbling back into the dark ages, if not the stone ages](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=VOMWzjrRiBg) if we don't find solutions capitalism does not offer, so be careful what you wish for, or your children and theirs - assuming they live to have any - will despise you.  As it is, the resource wars are hotting up

&gt;It would absolutely cripple business in this country because other countries do not operate in such a manner

You're assuming that big is always better, in many instances though (and most transnational corporate instances), this is only the case because the market is distorted under capitalism with huge subsidies to support Sloanist mass production, transportation/distribution, and so [bolster economies of scale and disguise diseconomies of scale](http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/economic-calculation-in-the-corporate-commonwealth/).  In a genuinely free market business would be smaller, lither, more local and less sclerotic.

&gt;You don't own a business just because you work for it.

You are the only input which creates value.

&gt;According to my reddit enhancement suite you're on -38 votes from me. 

Not something you should be proud of, downvoting someone with whom you disagree.  I can't say I'm really surprised that that's how you operate here, I often see posts where it appears the ""rightist"" argument is ""winning"", but reddit enhancement suite often shows it's more a case of us leftists following reddiquette and not jabbing at the downvote button so emotionally.

&gt;What you've just written to me is extreme nazi socialism. 

Absolute bollocks.  I should downvote you simply on the basis of that unworthy piece of Godwinesque trolling.  I'm as far from Nazi as it is possible to be, I suspect you may sit somewhat closer, but I won't go down that route. 

I hope that neither one of us genuinely has Nazi sympathies, but any objective analysis of fascism and the Nazi ideology has to acknowledge that they were centred around an extreme form of corporate capitalism (something which I wholeheartedly oppose).  Indeed, both Hitler and Mussolini received massive corporate funding and sought to ensure a leftist-free environment for corporations to operate in by only allowing party unions to operate from within the State hierarchy.  Cantankerous independent trade unionists, leftists, socialists, communists and anarchists like me were swiftly rounded up if they didn't flee and sent to die alongside the Jews.

&gt;You're the same as a far right Muslim group to me, your beliefs are laughable.

I shall return the favour, but without the racist undertones.

It's not about the fact that Rose and the Doctor ran into themselves, it's the fact that they crossed their own timelines in a way that caused a predestination paradox. Rose ran in front of her past self to save her father; as a result, her father never died and she never travelled there to save him, and so on, which created the cracks that let the Reapers through.

The old guard can still be effective, but only when playing a very specific way and as individuals they're all much more mistake-prone than they were just two seasons ago. Can't blame him for the Torres problem, I think AVB should be commended just for making the guy look decent out there in some matches; he certainly looks much better than he did last season (although some of that could be because he's only recently regained 100% fitness). Nobody knows how big of an effect the JT situation has had on the squad, but anybody who tries to spin it as a positive, as something that  has galvanized the team,  something for us to rally around as Blues, is being very foolish, in my opinion. Players losing form is  nothing new. Racism scandals are nothing new. But the magnitude of both of these issues seems to exceed anything we've seen before.

We finish 6th, just 2 points behind Chelsea for 5th and just 4 behind Liverpool for 4th. Don't panic though, behold my cruelty:

In my simulation we lose 3-0 to United, lose 1-0 at Everton, draw at home against Stoke, lose 2-0 at Chelsea, lose 2-1 at Sunderland, draw at Bolton, draw at Villa. We win home against: Swansea, Norwich, Blackburn, and Fulham and we win at QPR. Only one away win for the rest of the season. 4 losses and 3 draws. 

After losing to Arsenal in my simulation, Liverpool wins **EVERY SINGLE REMAINING GAME**. That includes trips to Swansea, Newcastle, Sunderland, and a win against Chelsea at Anfield. 

Meanwhile, Arsenal win every single remaining game except for a draw against City at the Emirates. That includes the win at Anfield, a win at Goodison, and a win against Chelsea at home. 

What I'm getting at is, even if we just completely fall apart at the seams, we've put ourselves in such a good spot that Liverpool and to a lesser degree Arsenal will literally have to win every remaining game. Pick any 4 points for Liverpool to drop along the way and boom we're 4th--even if we fail as hard as my simulation. 

I **do** think there is a very real chance of Arsenal finishing 3rd because they have the easiest run in pretty comfortably, but if we finish lower than 4th I will cut my fucking right pinky off and feed it to birds or something.

The radio dramas are fantastic! As good as the show, but longer so more room for deeper and more layered stories. They blow your mind as well as any new Who story. Same with classic. And I loved some of the books too! Love and War, Lungbarrow, Human Nature, The Infinity Doctors

The continuity errors are big enough that some fans have invented a theory of a missing season between ""The War Games"" and ""Spearhead from Space"" in which the Time Lords send an unwilling Doctor out to do missions for them before administering his exile to Earth.  It's nuts, but it would explain Jamie knowing about the Time Lords, the Doctor steering the Tardis flawlessly, etc. Personally, I instead suspect this ""Second Doctor and Jamie"" must have been impostors.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Heroism is an individual thing and to confer it on a group or a class of people is a really dangerous thing to do. Not only does it completely mislabel what the military is about but is also dangerous.

When people ask how the nazis got so many soldiers to sign up, that's your answer right there.

German soldiers who signed up in world war 2 weren't people with evil in their brain, they were normal, everyday people who signed up for something they believed in.

The deification of the troops, and blind propaganda to support the troops is a sign that there is something wrong with your country. Without this manufactured public support, the government of any country would be very wary when deciding whether or not to invade another country, regardless of allies.

And this is exactly why they do it. any detractors can be labelled as traitors or unpatriotic.

This quote is quite fitting in this situation;

&gt; “Naturally the common people don't want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor in America, nor in Germany. That is understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.”

 -  Hermann Goering

Without wishing to start *that* debate, I live in Scotland, and since they went into coalition, the Lib Dems are about as popular as the Tories here (the Tories have had one seat in Scotland in 20 years).

Anyway, something called ""devolution max"" is very popular with voters here, which, if implemented, would essentially result in a federal UK. Before the prospect of a referendum on independence became a reality, the Lib Dems were very big on federalism and further devolution for Scotland, but since coalition, they've gone the other way. 

They're going to need a miracle not to get a battering at the ballot box in Scotland come the next election, so I can't understand why they won't endorse devo-max (other than the fact the Tories are against it, of course). It's a policy natural to their instincts (you'd think), and it'd be a win for them they badly need were they to back it. But they won't. 

All of which is a very long way of saying that I think, as such junior partners in the coalition, they're having a great deal of pressure put on their policies and principles by the Tories. Or they're just hypocrites and liars. Hmm.

Honestly, I didn't mean to start talking about the Scotland issue, was just an example of the Lib Dems not behaving in a way you'd expect or imagine they would do. ",0,1330674664,null,0,false,0,c3wvyfy,t3_qcxl1,t1_c3wvyfy,t1_c3wnhxt,null,1428453096,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Josh won't be scoring 10 goals a season, maybe not even 5. But he's a creator. He's used at Swansea mostly as a holding mid, but I know for our youth he was an attacking mid. Just checked his stats for the past two games at swansea. His passing? 14/16 last game and 49/51 two games ago. 12/13 of those in the attacking third. What more can you ask of a 19 year old midfielder? Nothing. You're correct in assuming that Mata is our only creative player, although I would argue that David Luiz has that spark too. Yet for our long term plans in this club, we can't keep buying creativity. Look at our youth and new signings. McEachran (creator) Romeu and Kakuta, de Bruyne, Piazon (constantly compared to a young Kaka), Mata, David Luiz, Courtois is a wall in goal in La Liga, Lukaku will be better than Drogba. We need to develop our current potential rather than trying to buy it. We've tried that (Torres, Robben, Shev, Ballack) and it hasn't panned out well. Yeah, we do need a creative mid or two, but at the same time we're developing a team for the 2014 season, something that Chelsea has never done before.

The bit that winds me up the most is you saying that often people who become soldiers have fewer options than most.

Its difficult for a civillian, who has no inclination to join the army, to understand that a lot of people simply want to join the armed forces because they enjoy the job. Granted their are a few individuals who join because they have nowhere to go. But a hell of a lot of the armed forces in Britain are there because it's their dream career, it's something they've always wanted to do, or always being interested in.

It's hard to explain to someone, who doesn't share your mentality, why you would want to go to war. Some people are adrenaline junkies, some people genuinely support the wars we fight and want to serve their country, and indeed a small minority of people simply want to kill people legally. 

I always like to remind people who try to decredit the armed forces, that the biggest reason you should support our all volounteer services is that if they didn't offer to go and fight on your behalf, you would have to. Were lucky that we have people willing to serve otherwise we would have conscription again. And that isn't good for any party involved.

To sumarise, whilst not every man and woman in the armed forces deserves your respect (ill personally testify to that) the services as a whole do. The men and women in the armed forces are willing to do a job that many of you wouldn't even consider, whether you agree with the wars they fight or not is irrelevant. That's the governments policy not theirs. And there's always the possibility that one day we may need the armed forces to defend the country from attack again.

Off the top of my head, the one criticism I have with your argument is that countries like Germany, Canada, France all have higher immigration rates than the UK and a greater proportion of their population is composed of foreigners (compared to us), yet they consistently perform better than us according to measures such as: Physical health, Mental health, Drug abuse, Education, Imprisonment rates, Obesity rates, Violence and Teenage births.

[Foreigners as a percentage of state population](http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/imm_for_pop-immigration-foreign-population)

[Immigrants as a percentage of state population](http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/imm_imm_pop_imm_as_per_of_sta_pop-immigrant-population-immigrants-percentage-state)

I now remember the argument that the authors made for this. Not only did they look at these key measures across 20 of the wealthiest countries. They also monitored these stats across the 50 US states. They found that a high degree of correlation between these measures and inequality still existed and that there was almost no correlation between these measures and the degree of immigration that these states were subject too. For example: Alaska is one of the most unequal states (The 5th most unequal state in the US), it has a very low degree of immigration - it has a fairly homogenous society and yet suffers from all the negative effects that are found to be associated with a high degree of inequality. The opposite can be said for Hawaii which performs a lot better at these social measures and yet has quite a diverse society.

&gt; I think it's genuinely a hard question. But one response is that wealth doesn't go to the core of people's identity in the way ethnicity does, so you can argue it's more permissible for government to get involved in changing it.

In answer to your question, relative wealth is not the same as ethnicity in that it is something that can be changed. While governments have the ability to tackle issues like inequality, they should. Cultural differences evaporate over time and segregation only postpones the inevitible conflict (look at what has happened in South Africa). Lastly, as controversial as this is, I believe that governments should encourage cultural homogeneity by requiring immigrants to ""fit in"" - whether this means requiring them to spend a minimum number of hours volunteering in their communities or requiring them to spend some time at the pub is up for debate, but I think measures such as these would be helpful.",0,1330680406,null,0,false,0,c3wwgpn,t3_qcpf4,t1_c3wwgpn,t1_c3ww3l3,null,1428453321,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"At the outset, I should make clear that my post was an olive branch (as it were) from someone coming from a very different perspective than yourself, and it needs to be read in that light.  You can entirely reject my PoV, but what I was trying to get across was that even people with my worldview aren't necessarily kneejerk anti military.

&gt;The bit that winds me up the most is you saying that often people who become soldiers have fewer options than most.

It obviously does depend, and we're far from a draft in contemporary Britain, but in hard economic times the military is definitely one route to an education and a career for people who mightn't otherwise have that option.  It's obviously much more the case in the US where options for funding education and routes out of poverty are harder to come by (though evidence does suggest our society is becoming increasingly like theirs, and social mobility is worse than for a very long time), and the military is a massively more high profile and significant employer in the US also.

&gt;But a hell of a lot of the armed forces in Britain are there because it's their dream career, it's something they've always wanted to do, or always being interested in.

&gt;It's hard to explain to someone, who doesn't share your mentality, why you would want to go to war. Some people are adrenaline junkies, some people genuinely support the wars we fight and want to serve their country, and indeed a small minority of people simply want to kill people legally. 

Clearly, as a radical, I have much less headspace and sympathy for these individuals (for the last category, none at all).  But as a non-pacifist, I do recognise, even in my wildest utopian fantasies, that an anarchist society requires people skilled in the arts of war, who, sharing common cause and acting in community defence, would be necessary to martial, train and indeed in many cases lead any notional ""people's militia"" against invaders, reactionary forces within/without etc., so I'm not unsympathetic to professional soldiers per se (certainly to their political leadership, often to their individual political views and actions, but not to the idea of soldiering as an honorable profession).",0,1330681053,null,0,false,0,c3wwiew,t3_qdnv1,t1_c3wwiew,t1_c3wwco3,null,1435735216,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

The UK has just changed from the military being completely hidden (IRA and lack of past-service now being common) to being a little more open in that there is the odd parade and some soldiers sometimes travel in uniform. The change has been more that it is no longer (so) acceptable to abandon crippled soldiers or bill the families of the deceased for kit destroyed in action.

You are, that sentence is written in the present tense.

Police don't intentionally stay away from trouble spots.

Look, you obviously have a bone to pick with the way the police work. I don't know whether you're a victim of crime, a left wing radical or an anarchist or whatever.

However...

The fact is, the vast majority of Police Officers are good people, who genuinely want to make their neighbourhoods a better place to live. They reason they aren't effective in doing so isn't their fault. First off they have to work on  very tight budget and they have limited resources, this has been happening for a very long time. They also have their hands tied behind their back when it comes to policing. They have to fill in crippling amounts of paperwork for the simplest of jobs, they're subject to intense scrutiny of every action they take which limits their effectiveness. They can't win when it comes to their approach to tackling crime.

In the student riots the police were accused of being too heavy handed dealing with the rioters, in the London riots they were accused of not being tough enough. They can't win, no matter what action they take people criticise them.

Public opinion is massively biased against the Police force, but despite this they try to do the best they can with the resources they are allocated.

If you truly have a problem with the effectiveness of your local Police force, don't take it out on them, they can't change anything. Write to your local MP and get the government to stop crippling the Police force with severe budget cuts, then maybe we'll see a difference.",0,1330689210,null,0,true,0,c3wx1lo,t3_q6d0a,t1_c3wx1lo,t1_c3wwzyv,null,1428453626,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Allyson M Pollock a, David Price a, Peter Roderick b, Tim Treuherz c, David McCoy d, Martin McKee e, Lucy Reynolds e
The National Health Service (NHS) in England has been a leading international model of tax-financed, universal health care. Legal analysis shows that the Health and Social Care Bill currently making its way through the UK Parliament1 would abolish that model2and pave the way for the introduction of a US-style health system by eroding entitlement to equality of health-care provision. The Bill severs the duty of the Secretary of State for Health to secure comprehensive health care throughout England and introduces competitive markets and structures consistent with greater inequality of provision, mixed funding, and widespread provision by private health corporations. The Bill has had a turbulent passage. Unusually, the legislative process was suspended for more than 2 months in 2011 because of the weight of public concern.3 It was recommitted to Parliament largely unaltered after a “listening exercise”. These and more recent amendments to the Bill do not sufficiently address major concerns that continue to be raised by Peers and a Constitution Committee of the House of Lords,4, 5 where the Bill now faces one of its last parliamentary hurdles before becoming law.
Fundamental to the Bill are provisions that transform a mandatory system into a discretionary one with structures that permit the introduction of charging for services that are currently free under the NHS, as well as a system in which much delivery would be privatised. Under the current statutory framework the Government has a legal duty to secure comprehensive health care, whereas, under the new system, substantial discretionary powers will instead be extended to commissioners and providers of care. These measures will increase inequalities of provision.
Clauses 1 and 12 of the Bill will dismantle key sections of the 1946 founding legislation of the NHS by repealing the unifying duty from which all other legislative powers and functions flow.6 This unifying duty is currently laid down in Sections 1 and 3 of the National Health Service Act 2006. It requires the Government to promote a comprehensive health service by providing or securing the provision throughout England of a list of specified NHS services and hospital accommodation in ways that meet all reasonable requirements. Accordingly, since 1948, most NHS hospital and community-based provision has its own facilities and NHS staff. The whole system has been publicly administered and funded on the basis of contiguous geographical areas by bodies, now called primary care trusts (PCTs), that act on behalf of the Secretary of State and have responsibility for the health-care needs of everyone in their area. Experiments with internal and external markets since 1990 have taken place within this overarching geographical framework.
The Bill creates two new bodies with responsibility for managing care: an NHS Commissioning Board and Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), the number of which remain unclear. PCTs will be abolished and not replaced. Powers currently exercised by the Secretary of State for Health will be transferred to each CCG, which, in contrast to PCTs, will act in place of, and not on behalf of, the minister. The NHS Commissioning Board will exercise its functions at a distance from the Secretary of State and have oversight of CCGs. These changes will repeal the minister's core duty to provide or secure provision of specified health services.
Clause 12 of the Health and Social Care Bill repeals the Secretary of State's “duty to provide” specific services. Instead, a “duty to arrange” provision is imposed on each of the many CCGs that will also have transferred to them the power to determine what care is necessary to meet all reasonable requirements. However, CCGs will not have the duty to promote a comprehensive free health service. Amendments suggested by the Government in a letter to Peers from the responsible minister dated",0,1330692623,null,0,false,0,c3wxajo,t3_qduxm,t1_c3wxajo,t1_c3wups9,null,1428453754,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,MatthewMatic,cnty-expat,Expat East Anglian,"Jan 12, 2012, do not restore the duty.7 Thus, the link between the duty to promote comprehensive care and the duty to provide would be severed.
Although the Government has said that its intention is to “reinforce” the overarching duty to promote a comprehensive health service,8 the creation of bodies that are independent of the Secretary of State for Health to support a lesser duty fundamentally affects the minister's duty. This is because the test of whether the Secretary of State is discharging his or her duty to promote a comprehensive health service will no longer depend on whether a comprehensive service is actually provided.
As well as transferring powers from the Secretary of State to other bodies, the Bill leaves each CCG free to choose the patients for whom they have responsibility. Unlike PCTs, CCGs will not be responsible for all residents within contiguous geographical areas. CCGs select patients, initially assembling their patient populations on the basis of general practitioners' (GPs) lists; they will not have to cover everyone in a geographical area but only “persons for whom it [the CCG] has responsibility”. Nor will they be required to arrange for the provision of all the services that are currently part of the comprehensive health system. For example, accident and emergency services are not an explicit CCG responsibility under these proposals. Only a new category “of services or facilities for emergency care” will have to be provided for people in a CCG's area, which need not consist of adjoining or indeed whole electoral districts, as is the case with PCTs.
Another organisation, known as Monitor and with the functions of a regulator, is independent of the Secretary of State for Health, and will have oversight of providers (public and private) in the new system. However, it will not have a duty to promote a comprehensive service—a crucial consideration given that its decisions about the extent of competition will affect the financial viability of local services. In a parallel move, NHS hospitals that currently get most of their funding from NHS sources will be free to obtain almost half their income from private patients.
Although there are provisions in the Bill giving the Secretary of State for Health power to regulate the new system through secondary rather than primary legislation, that power is limited by a new clause (Clause 4), under which the minister has a duty to observe the autonomy of commissioners and providers. The autonomy clause means that commercial providers can bring legal challenges against a minister who chooses to curtail their discretion. Furthermore, the adoption of compulsory market competition will bring more NHS activity under the jurisdiction of EU competition law. Competition law is designed to limit government powers of intervention and will provide a further check on secondary regulation.
These changes will have substantial legal consequences. First, the duty to provide a national health service throughout England would be lost if the Bill became law.9 It would be replaced by a duty on an unknown number of CCGs, not GPs, to arrange provision as they see fit for various sections of the population for which they are separately responsible. Second, CCGs would not be bound by the “duty to continue to promote a comprehensive free health service” when exercising their functions. Under present law, according to a judgment of the Court of Appeal, the Secretary of State “has the duty to continue to promote a comprehensive free health service and he must never, in making a decision [about services provided], disregard that duty”.10 Third, the Secretary of State's accountability to Parliament for the provision of services to patients in the new NHS will be diminished.4, 11
At the same time, a new parallel system of public health services will be established at the local level. Under this system, the provision of a range of public health services will be assigned to local authorities, including immunisation, screening, mental health, dental health, children's services, sexual health, drug and alcohol services, and health protection programmes. However, neither services nor funding have been defined.12 Moreover, in this new system local authorities will have considerable discretion to define and decide what services are provided and how. As with the social services they provide, these services may be chargeable.",0,1330692641,null,0,false,0,c3wxalk,t3_qduxm,t1_c3wxalk,t1_c3wxajo,null,1428453757,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,MatthewMatic,cnty-expat,Expat East Anglian,"All these factors will increase inequality in service access, provision, and uptake. The abolition of PCTs and loss of overall political control will impair, or take away altogether, current information systems used to monitor inequalities at area level. The new structures for CCGs and public health create such a multiplicity of denominators, resource flows, populations, and fragmented responsibilities for care and data that systematic inequalities will cease to be identifiable and no body will have overall responsibility for an area. Furthermore, the loss of area-based population responsibilities has serious implications for the stability and accuracy of measurement of needs and equity of resource allocation and service provision. Loss of geographical population data and area-based structures and responsibilities will impair, or take away altogether, the capacity to plan health services by monitoring needs, access, service use, and health outcomes.
The Government has not disclosed the radical nature of this reform. The Leader of the House of Lords, Earl Howe, told the Lords that the Bill reinforces and does not “dilute the Secretary of State's overarching duty…Let me be clear: the Bill's provisions would in no way dilute the Secretary of State's overarching duty. Indeed, they are intended further to reinforce the promotion of a comprehensive health service rather than to undermine it.”7 Legal analysis of the Bill shows this is not the case. Recent amendments raised for consideration in a letter of Jan 12, 2012, from Earl Howe to Peers do not substantially change the situation.7
In the USA, opposition to health reforms under both the Clinton and Obama administrations is articulated as erosion of personal freedom by increasing government powers.13 Conversely, pro-market reforms of universal health systems in Europe are often justified on the grounds that they increase personal freedom by transferring powers from government to non-governmental or commercial bodies and by increasing choice. Citizens' rights in democracies are underpinned not just by limitations on government powers but also by legal duties imposed on governments, such as those that guarantee citizens access to health care. The Bill would withdraw this legal underpinning.14 As the Bill enters its final critical stages it is crucial that Peers observe three red lines for the NHS (panel)15 and are fully aware of the key parts of the legislation that would abolish core NHS functions, if they are to safeguard the NHS for future generations.
Panel
Red lines to protect the NHS
The Secretary of State must have the duty to secure provision of comprehensive and equitable health care for the whole of the population of England, taking action whenever there are problems.
CCGs, operating on behalf of the Secretary of State, must make sure that comprehensive and equitable health care is available for everyone and be responsible for all residents living in single geographically defined areas that are contiguous, without being able to pick and choose patients.
Nothing must be done that undermines the ability of the Secretary of State to fulfil the duty to secure provision of comprehensive and equitable health care, by bringing more of the NHS within the scope of EU competition law so that, in particular:
There must be no increase in the commercial contracting of health services;
The current authorisation system for central regulation of Foundation Trusts must be retained;
Statutory functions of CCGs must be carried out by NHS staff, with CCG finances being used solely for the benefit of patients;
Statutory and enforceable codes of conduct must be laid down for all NHS bodies, underpinned by sanctions that are rigorously policed;
Information about commercial contracting, including the planning, procurement, financing, and monitoring, must be available as a matter of course.
CCGs=Clinical Commissioning Groups.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; You've hit the nail on the head here. The problem is that we don't need our armed forces at the moment. But rather than doing peace-time activities, such as training and international peace-keeping, our armed forces are being (ab)used, politically.

I'm going to be crude here but bear with me and hopefully you'll understand what I'm saying.

What do you think the best way to train our armed forces is? Running around a training area in Wales or Canada? Or, fighting a low scale war?

If nothing else, Afghanistan means that we keep the skills of our soldiers up to scratch. I'm not suggesting for one minute that this is the reason we are in Afghanistan, however it is a positive side effect of it (purely from a military point of view). It is far better to have the next generation of soldiers taught by veterans of combat as opposed to people who have learned warfare from a book.

Like it or not, Britain is, and always has been a war fighting nation. The main reason we're so bloody good at it is that we've always been at it. If you look back through the history of Great Britain (or indeed the British Isles) you'll notice we've been involved in a war roughly every 25 years or so. We're a nation of warriors.

Also, they're not being abused politically, they're not being made to do anything they didn't sign up for. Soldiers sign up knowing they may be asked to fight in wars, wars that they may not personally agree with. It's a condition of entry to the armed forces (you literally have to sign a contract saying you agree to this). Soldiers can't pick and choose which conflict to fight in, giving soldiers that right would completely undermine the chain of command and the army would cease to exist as an effective force. That being said, any soldier who joins the army now days is guaranteed to deploy to Afghanistan at some point. So presumably every man who signs the contract has already made peace with himself and accepted the war over there.

&gt; Unfortunately, whether or not you agree with our government's foreign policy is a factor. For those of us that see our government warmongering, there would seem to be very little honour in doing our government's bidding in the armed forces. If we ever came under attack, the situation would be different, I'm sure.

I can see why you think our government are warmongers, I truly can. And as I've mentioned to another poster on here I don't judge you for that. A stable society requires input from people of all persuasions, and I'll be the first to admit that a nation run by soldiers simply wouldn't work.

But people don't realise that we are only where we are today due to the actions of the British Armed forces throughout the ages. The reason we are a strong country economically (we are, no matter how bad the recession has hit us) is due to us having a strong armed forces that calved out an Empire. The reason we continue to punch above our weight on the international negotiating table is due to the capability of our armed forces,  specifically the nuclear deterrent.

As you have said, if we ever came under attack, people would be grateful we have such a strong armed forces. As past generations have been grateful. Only supporting our armed forces when they're fighting popular wars is akin to only supporting a football team because they're winning.

Unfortunately warfare is part of human nature, and unless everyone in the world decides to drastically change how they act at the same time, it's never going to change.

We're not, Humans are a tribal species by nature. Warfare has always been a part of Human society and, unless everyone in the world suddenly and drastically changes they way they think, that won't change.

&gt; Do you think we'll be able to evolve beyond war?

No I don't. I don't think the Human race will ever evolve beyond war. As you say, I think that if an external threat appears  then the Earth can unify against that threat. However I don't think we'll ever see a day when warfare doesn't exist.

&gt; On a less surreal note, if we spent just 1% of the worlds military expenditure on building infrastructure so that everyone can access clean water and feed themselves, whilst investing in renewable energy, then we would have significantly less conflict.

Maybe it would reduce conflict to an extent, but it wouldn't disappear. There are many reasons man has gone to war, and man will always find new reasons to do so. In a world where men are prepared to kill themselves and go to war for an imaginary god, do you really think providing energy and resources to all the world will quell conflict?

Certain nations have evolved beyond war - costa rica, switzerland - and so have certain societies at different points in history. 

Almost all of the reasons for war are BS and are just about money and power for a select few. The government, no government, really gives a fuck about its soldiers, they are treated horribly. It comes down to personal responsibility ultimately, if everyone decided it was just an unethical to be a part of an aggressive military as it is to fiddle with kids then wars would reduce again. It is each individual, including you who is enabling the brutal wars against poor people with your billions of pounds of equipment.

&gt; Like it or not, Britain is, and always has been a war fighting nation.

&gt; we are only where we are today due to the actions of the British Armed forces throughout the ages.

All good points, and all relevant in understanding the nature of our nation and how we got where we are. But none of these points are a *justification* for war.

&gt; As you have said, if we ever came under attack, people would be grateful we have such a strong armed forces. Only supporting our armed forces when they're fighting popular wars is akin to only supporting a football team because they're winning.

I'd go further than that - I'm pretty sure that many people who are currently opposed to our government's current use of the armed forces, would sign-up! (Me included!) But that's because *defending* yourself is ethically justifiable. It certainly has nothing to do with popularity!

&gt; Also, they're not being abused politically, they're not being made to do anything they didn't sign up for.

Well, I'm not sure this is entirely the case. I would suspect that, even with the current ongoing actions, the huge majority of servicemen/women sign-up with good intentions: to defend their country, to protect their loved ones, etc. Even if they are aware of what they are signing-up to (and I'm sure most of them are), there is still an implicit trust being placed in their government, that the government will use the armed forces ""for good"".

This is why I used the word ""abused"". I am not against having an armed forces. We need one, and it is justifiable to have one in a world where we would otherwise face attack. Fine, no problems. But to use those armed forces for *offensive* purposes, for political gain, and with such a great cost to innocent life, is simply not ethical. It is an abuse of an otherwise justifiable organisation.

I suppose this is where we have to agree to disagree. As you've mentioned I'm sure many people agree with the idea of having an armed forces for defence. I also happen to think there's certain situations where offensive force is required.

I'm not stupid though, I can certainly see that there's a huge moral grey area in that respect. Is there every a situation where you would agree with offensive force? The war in Afghanistan, despite being immensely unpopular, is justified in international law. It's backed by the UN, unlike the war in Iraq. 

I will admit though that even I am beginning to become disillusioned with the war in Afghanistan. I agreed with the reasons we went there in the first place, but I don't believe we can win any more.

true,highaboveme,pertwee,Pertwee,"MY SO and I did the same thing and we decided to watch some of the classic Doctor Who.  There was a 20th anniversary special called ""The Five Doctors"" that does a pretty good job of introducing you to the first 5 Doctors.  From there you could pick one and start watching.  I own the entire series, but there are quite a few on Netflix.  Also, there are threads about the opinions on each Doctor's best episode; you could always pick a random Doctor and try an episode/story.

Keep in mind that classic Doctor Who has an entirely different feel to it... Think of Batman and everyone who has portrayed him and the different styles of filming, (e.g. Adam West in the 70s, Keaton/Kilmer/Clooney in the 90s, and currently Christian Bale.  It's honestly that huge of a difference in filming and storytelling style, but in Doctor Who it's a continuation of one storyline.  Also, the old series was a little different, with episodes being around 22m and a story encompassing on average from 4-7 episodes.  On NetFlix, classic Doctor Who is arranged by stories.  

I've watched 2, 3, 4, and 5, and at the moment 3 is my favorite of the classic Doctors, but be warned that he spends the majority of his first 3 seasons exiled to earth with broken TARDIS.

Unfortunately, unless you want to start with season 1, episode 1 you are inevitably going to run into spoilers for yourself or plot points that make no sense.  However, since I have no intention of finishing the classic series anytime soon so it's much more fun to jump around.

Obviously the reason countries formed in the first place was that people naturally have different opinions, traditions, cultures etc. I can't see any scenario, other than an external threat, in which we could convince everyone in the world to start towing the line together.

When the police raid someone due to a false accusation, they can and do protect the malicious ""informants"". My own grandparents were raided over blatantly cannot-be-true accusations against my grandfather twice. The police couldn't even execute the raids properly - e.g. for the second raid they refused to show a warrant or any other paperwork during that raid, and posted an improperly completed warrant through the letterbox the next day.

The way the system is set up, my grandfathers attempts to get the police to acknowledge that they were wrong and reveal the clearly malicious informants identity just turned into further victimisation of my grandparents. The first thing the IPCC try to do is to encourage you to accept a quick-and-easy resolution process where the police decide whether they were in the wrong or not, and what they don't tell you is that if you fall for it you have no right to appeal afterwards. When my grandfather didn't fall for that for the second raid, well, the legal process is very expensive and practically very difficult for an elderly man with no transport. The police and the IPCC just delayed everything until my grandfather died last year.

Basically, the police are a convenient weapon for victimizing innocent people, and they seem to like it that way. Ask at your local station and they'll probably give you a glossy leaflet listing all their special deals on destroying peoples lives.

I made a passing comment, which you blew completely out of proportion.

I'm not advocating the ""Forcible removal of entire ethnic groups"". First of all a little background. Not so long ago, travellers moved onto land (illegally) near my neighbourhood. Since then, many people, myself included have been the victims of crime, including theft and physical attacks/intimidation. Copper wires have been stolen from telephone lines, and church roofs have been raided for metal too.

Now I know, that's not proof that travellers have committed the crimes. But the evidence pointing to them is high, especially considering my neighbourhood had very little problems with crime before they turned up.

They hang around on the estate, intimidating people and generally causing a nuisance. Several people have also being physically attacked, or threatened when they've tried to intervene with them.

Now, considering this is the only exposure I've ever had to travellers, and considering that other people in my extended family have experienced similar events, it's fair to assume that my view of the traveller people as a whole is fairly jaded right? I've never had reason to believe they are anything other than thieving scumbags. There's only so much one can tolerate.

I know there are other travellers who don't behave this way, there are probably many groups throughout the country who behave quite well and generally contribute to society, but I am yet to meet them.

When I said wish the government would toughen up and adopt a similar approach, I didn't mean the entire traveller population should rounded up and deported like some kind of fascist eugenics program. I meant I wish the government would be tougher on moving these traveller camps when they appear, the one near my neighbourhood is illegal, and nothing but trouble has ensued since they first appeared. The government, local council or whoever should forcibly move them on.

Not because I have a problem with their race, but because their camp is illegal and they are criminals. 

I'm not a racist, I don't judge people based on their ethnicity, the colour of their skin, their religious beliefs whatever, I judge people by their actions. I don't dislike the travellers near my house simply because they are travellers, I dislike them because of the problems they have caused.

I've said my part, I can see why you misunderstood my original post as it was a sweeping statement and it didn't clarify what I meant. We both rapidly descended into petty name calling and it all became a bit immature.

The family (including myself) were strongly against this. As this is anonymous, and my grandfather is dead now anyway, I guess this is safe enough, so this is why...

For the second raid, my grandfather was accused of dealing in child pornography over the internet. The police claimed to have absolute proof (I forget their exact words) of this. Although they didn't actually say it, they seemed convinced that he was running a child pornography photo studio and selling the images over the internet.

My grandfather was IIRC 86 when this raid took place. Although he owned some cameras, they were mostly unused - he just hoarded junk. Especially the antique clocks and clock repair stuff that filled the house to the point that there was no possibility of anyone running a photo studio, or even of walking from one room to another without tripping over. Because of all the junk, and because most of the family lives out of the local area, even their great grandchildren rarely if ever visited (I don't have children myself). Most windows didn't even have curtains. There was a security video system which clearly showed who had been in and out of the house. My grandparents never owned a computer in their lives, and did not have an internet connection.

The one piece of equipment that the police didn't seize during the raid was the security camera. That caught the raid, including events the police lied about. A few days later, it also caught a couple of men who tried to extort money from my grandparents for information relating to the raid. My grandfather naively reported that to the police and allowed them to take the security system rather than copy off the relevant video (my grandfather wasn't good with technology) - and predictably, the video of the raid and everything after ceased to exist.

When she was out with the doctor, she complained about how she wanted to go home. Once he brought her home, she only wanted to come back. When he saves her life, she hits him and puts him down. When there is an emergency, she stamps about and asks ""what do I do??"" over and over, instead of trying to think it through. I never found her funny. I (again, personal opinion) found her to be overbearing, childish, and rude. I am still angry with the writers about Donna.

true,ajehals,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;The bit that winds me up the most is you saying that often people who become soldiers have fewer options than most.

Probably depends on when they enlisted, there have been significant periods where the Army was looking for warm bodies when there were few jobs on the civilian side (nationally or regionally).  Of course it depends on the job, quite a few posts are hard to get in to, some border on the impossible when you compare people who want to get in to those who make it.  Broadly however I'd agree with you, this isn't the US where you join the Army for college sponsorship and medical care, almost everyone in uniform wants to be there (or did at one point...).

&gt;It's hard to explain to someone, who doesn't share your mentality, why you would want to go to war. Some people are adrenaline junkies, some people genuinely support the wars we fight and want to serve their country, and indeed a small minority of people simply want to kill people legally.

And some people don't want to get left out when everyone else is deploying nor be the one person without a ribbon (assuming they get the choice).  If all your mates, the people you live with are going somewhere to actually 'do' the job, then there is a hell of a lot of pressure, both peer pressure and your own personal drive pushing you do do the same.

&gt;I always like to remind people who try to decredit the armed forces, that the biggest reason you should support our all volounteer services is that if they didn't offer to go and fight on your behalf, you would have to. 

Possibly, what they should really be doing is making sure the government does the right thing with the people who volunteer.  Once people are in uniform, they have a job to do and will do it, yes they should refuse certain fairly specific demands if they are made, but broad philosophical of complex legal questions don't fall into those bounds.

A soldier being sent by his government to fight in a war of questionable legality isn't committing a crime. A soldier who abuses prisoners and kills civilians whilst in theatre is.

true,gingerdoc86,k9,K-9,"I absolutely adore Donna. She is hands down my favorite companion, though I also have a soft spot for Rose. In answer to several posts wondering why people love her so much I thought I’d throw my two cents in. While I could go on all day about why I love her, I’ll keep it to five things.
1.	I love the effect that Donna has on the Doctor and their relationship. They have great brother-sister banter and Donna helps the Doctor to not only be better (saving the family in Pompeii) but she helps him to have fun again. After the angst brought on by Rose and Martha, it is Donna who truly helps him to heal.
2.	I empathize with the difficulty she has in seeing herself as special or intelligent. Her mother is truly awful to her and did nothing to boost Donna’s self-esteem. It makes me root for Donna even more.
3.	I love the way her character grows over the course of her journey. I couldn’t stand her the first time I watched Runaway Bride and was braced for season 4 to be terrible. It ended up being my favorite season and largely due to Donna. Her first encounter with the Doctor woke her up to all of the possibilities the universe has to offer. I loved her determination to find him again. She learns to trust herself and her instincts.
4.	She absolutely breaks my heart. When the Doctor makes her revert to the old Donna I was just destroyed. To have learned and seen so much and done such important things and then have it all taken away was the most depressing thing ever. 
5.	She calls the Doctor on his bullshit, which he really needs. Yes, it’s part of the brother/sister dynamic but it really stands out for me. 

TL;DR: Donna is the awesome big sister the Doctor really needed.

Told us he was in favour of the coalition, it is going well and there is lots of harmony  between the ministers and it is a neccesary compromise. He believes it will survive as if a general election was called neither of the parties would do very well ""for obvious reasons"".

With Europe he said he was a europhile and as Britain is under European law this does aggravate some ministers, especially as some rules have to be removed under European law. He thinks it is good economically as manufacturers will ave a larger domestic market to develop technology ect He also said that to make Europe EUROPA, a whole country itself is a massive step and this would risk a break up between the countries...especially as some short term politicians are eager to make their mark (Euro) and rather than make a quick change a progressive one over a century or two would be far better. Also, we need more scientists as it is the future!

He is in a departmental select committee...transport in the 90s. He is chairman of the administration committee and the common wealth parliamentary association.

As deputy speaker they had many limits, they had to be fair and give every minister and equal say in a matter. He was not allowed to speak in the House...very excited when in 2005 and 2010 he was very popular. As  speaker he could go to what he wanted, never refuse a meeting and is secretary dealt with the numerous letters he got. From the sounds of it though, he might not go back but i am not sure!

They spend aaages talking about the lords reform and the public hardly cares and there are more important matters to deal with. Lords power has been drained because of our history, especially the last 700 years, we could draw up a bicemeral system in the constitution, but all the Lords do is delay bills. They do have very intelligent debates though, being old uni heads or union leaders as they can pretty much say what they like without offending many people, unlike an MP with a constituency. They crave power and believe their mandate is fresher than the House of Commons. Overall he is a sceptic.

The rebelling Conservatives, there are definitely serial offenders in the ranks. Yet most of the time whatever they are against passes so it does not seem to be a big problem. They have a right to the expression of their opinion, and Europe causes angst so there is no surprise they would rebel. But there is nothing wrong with rebelling once or twice, he did it a little bit in the 80s.

Well, that is all i could write! He also kept trying to out stare me which was REALLY annoying. I hope this was ok!

One that sticks out, though I haven't watched the Ecclestone episodes in quite a while, is when, *on-screen* the Doctor takes the TARDIS from the council estates to Albion Hospital, then later pilots the TARDIS back to the council estates.  Plausibly, the Doctor instead goes off-course during either, or both, of those journeys.  The TARDIS has, in the series' history, been really bad at making short trips.

No known anti-discrimination protections exist for sexual orientation or gender identity. The court opinion that struck down the criminal laws against homosexuality, when it involved consenting adults in private, was the first time that government discrimination against LGBT Indians was found to be unconstitutional.

and some background from wiki

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_India

&gt;No political party or individual Member of Parliament has proposed adding sexual orientation or gender identity to anti-discrimination laws in such areas as employment, education, housing, health care, banking and establishments that serve the general public.

Edit: and her deportation has been delayed.

I live here with another redditor, we've been here a couple of years. Both big fans of ambient / chillout music as well(God is an astronaut?)... as well as the less chilled out things (trip-hop/glitchhop?)....loads of other genres as well ;)

Ironically we are actually going to be going to Holland for the first time soon for Roadburn, where abouts were you studying? :-)

Anyway if you like beer/pubs then send us a PM and we can all meet up for a few.

http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_202481_en.pdf

&gt;Despite recent progress made by the UKBA, a number of major
concerns remain undiminished. These include:

&gt;• a lack of sensitivity to the difficulties that people fleeing
persecution may face in being open about their sexual
orientation or gender identity at the outset of their asylum
claim; so as a result people’s accounts of being lesbian,
gay or bisexual are routinely dismissed as not credible

&gt;• that when making decisions on LGBT asylum cases there is
a tendency to assess the evidence using stereotyped and
highly simplistic western benchmarks as to what constitutes
‘typical’ LGBT behaviour which fail to acknowledge the true
complex diversity of LGBT people

&gt;Our interviewees were heavily critical of the quality of decisions made
by UKBA on LGBT asylum claims. The most vocal criticisms often
related to UKBA’s regular refusal to believe that someone was, as
claimed, gay or lesbian.

&gt;There was a range of evidence which suggested that lesbian asylum
seekers find it extremely difficult to succeed in their asylum claims. As
well as shortcomings in the use of country evidence and criticisms of
the use of ‘safe internal relocation’, our research suggests that UKBA
is failing to fully understand the pressures that women come under
to conform to their expected gender role and often unfairly refuse to
accept women’s accounts of being a lesbian as credible.

3) Using a charity to further your political career. Do not ask me to come cheer for you at the finish-line. It's as obvious a move as a salesmen asking you a series of ""yes"" questions before the pitch.

4) Using charity money for useless memorials when there are people in need. Tower Hamlets is horribly deprived, they don't need a memorial, they need a new clinic.

5) Using constituency time to campaign. If I want to see my MP over the weekend to talk about a problem with a public service, I don't want to have to meet them at a political event. They should have an office that is designed to accept people of all political parties.

This might lead one to query, if it was not a photo opportunity for the press, what was the point of the visit? It may well fuel suspicion that Cameron was fully aware of plans to dismantle the NHS even though publicly he maintained the promise of no top down re-organisation. 

Not only that,

&gt;The other little titbit of information I was able to garner that might interest those keen on exploring how much tax these private healthcare companies might be paying the Chancellor of the Exchequer as a result of the dismantling of our NHS, is that Barchester Healthcare have a holding company in Jersey (here). I provide the link for you to explore that matter further, but needless to say it would be a matter of some consternation if the dismantling of our NHS coincided with the siphoning off of taxpayers money to offshore tax havens.

&gt;2) Running for charity. You run for yourself, or you give to charity. She presumably started this shit to get something to put on her uni application or CV, but then was never told that it's extremely pretentious and rude

Why can't you do both? How does running for charity forbid you from donating as well? Why do you feel it is pretentious and rude? She's donating her time to help a charity I really can't see how that could be considered pretentious or rude.

&gt;3) Using a charity to further your political career.

personally I can't see this either it seems she is deeply interested in charity and local area considering her career so far (for example she worked as Associate Director of the Young Foundation in Bethnal Green)

&gt;5) Using constituency time to campaign. If I want to see my MP over the weekend to talk about a problem with a public service, I don't want to have to meet them at a political event. They should have an office that is designed to accept people of all political parties.

It is only one day she is running the race, there is no doubt other times you can visit MPs to discuss issues. For example my MP runs local clinics throughout the week if you need to visit him and anybody can visit him regardless of political leaning and I would be very doubtful if it is very different here.

It's been trying to burst out every time I read about all this Orwellian bullshit, and today it did. That's all.

Most of the police seem like decent people most of the time. I have family who work for the police (in another area). But it's increasingly obvious that there's something wrong with the police as a whole, and with authorities as a whole. Whether it's a gradual tendency toward going bad, or it was always there but it's more visible now, it stinks.

These posters for example - they won't result in more solved crimes. It's hard to accept that they really believe that themselves. People who witness something that genuinely needs reporting and who would be willing to report it don't need those posters to tell them to do it. The whole point is to manipulate people using fear and prejudice, in order to justify continuing to take away our freedoms and protections - so that a few people can get as much power as possible with as little responsibility as possible.

One person reacted to this with ""Holy shit!"". But why? Compared with plenty of well known stories, this is trivial. My grandfather was not, for example, shot repeatedly in the back for no reason.

What makes my families story significant to me is that it happened in my family - these days, it would barely count even as an embarrassment to the police to have this reported. Just another thing for people to act shocked over and then forget about in a few days.

Except there is very little wrong with being stuck out on the left flank (unless he's man-marked by three defenders). If that's the case, he can swap wings with Lennon (if Aaron is playing on the opposite wing) or he can roam into central positions to pull defenders his way and free up room for someone else to attack the flank.

So I was a week away from going to Afghanistan. I needed to move from my rental house in Lincoln to the camp where I was based. I called the van rental place and asked specifically what ID I would need. They told me it was a Credit or Debit card, plus two things to prove my address, one of which had to be a bank statement. 

So on the Friday I turn up at Thrifty Van Rental with the required ID. There they tell me that the bank statement must actually match the bank account I'm going to pay my bill with, so because I took my savings statement which had a different sort code to my debit card, they refused to rent to me. I took everything they told me to. 

So, instead of spending my last weekend in the UK with my kids, I spent the whole weekend moving everything I owned using a little Peugeot 106. 

When I emailed the company from Afghanistan to complain about having been given wrong information and it having caused me problems on this scale, they emailed me back telling me their system said I had been properly informed.

Many of them had mental problems that come from inbreeding, upbringing and minimum education, so I find it hard to be scornful of them.

* We owned pure bred breeding dogs. They frequently stole them. We got some of them back by immediately chasing them and calling the police. My own childhood dog was stolen, resold somewhere and we never saw her again.
* They would walk into our garden and help themselves to things they saw. Lawnmower, bikes, etc.
* There was a field between our school and their camp. They would frequently step outside their caravans, pull down their trousers and defecate openly in the field. In front of primary school children.
* They settled scores with other travellers with massive bare nuckle fights. Think Snatch, but in an open field with hundreds of them.
* Many people in the neighbourhood had witnessed them stealing
* The tradition when somebody died was to burn their perfectly functioning caravan with their body inside it, like the Vikings. totally illegal, but that didn't stop them. So once in a while you'd see a burning caravan at the side of a busy main road. Totally dangerous and disturbing for locals.
* All their kids were pulled from school after Primary. After that it was join the family trade. Generally reselling stuff they'd either stolen or illegally scavenged. In the decade or so that they lived next to us I never saw them in legitimate work.

I assume you are referring to the Welfare Reform Bill, I wasn't aware of the details of this until reading about it after it had passed a few days ago. It is an awful bill and has the possibility to further degrade the quality of life of the severely disabled.

You can read a summary of the bill's effects on the provision for the disabled [here](http://www.disabilityalliance.org/f60.htm). My mother suffers from a severe case of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and yet it seems likely that this will cut her (already meagre) allowance drastically if not force her into work.

Going through the proposed test questions my mother would pass most of them, but she suffers from severe fatigue, various side effects from the immunosuppressant steroids, skin rashes from prolonged exposure to sunlight, a weak immune system leading to a far higher rate of disease, common bouts of shingles, and a history of heart failure.
Indeed, were anyone to know her for a prolonged period of time it would be readily apparent that she is entirely unable to work and this is the conclusion reached by her GP and consultants.

But none of these problems are touched on by those questions, I just can't imagine how a government that is saying it is giving GP's more responsibility and independence apparently doesn't trust them to judge their own patient's capacity to work and instead chooses to outsource the responsibility to a glorified IT firm (Atos) with a 'one size fits all' test.

true,HarryBlessKnapp,eng-GreaterLondon,South Weezey Mandem,"&gt;But drawing up a conclusion like because I've been on the dole I must think that if I work for a business I should be entitled to a share of the profits from it

I don't think you should be. Honestly, I have absolutely no idea where you got that impression. If you buy shares in your company you should have a share in the profits. I told you, I'm a big fan of capitalism. It's not too different to socialism. If the workers really wanted to own the means of production, capitalism provides the perfect means to achieve that, through purchasing shares.

I'm just saying I think YOU see it as too black and white. ""Socialism is bad, capitalism is good"". Whereas I'm saying the 2 become intertwined at certain points, for example where socialism in the form of a welfare state, and nationalised education and healthcare, can help people like you and me to attain the skills needed to contribute to a productive capitalist society. Not to mention nationalised infrastructure projects can provide the framework on which business can thrive.


But when all too frequently nepotism and cronyism have too much influence over policy, it undermines the free-market, capitalism *and* socialism.

Since this stream of thought has evolved blatantly into questions, what are him/her's personal interests in the Bill passing?  Can these really be negated from her opinion on the Bill? Why is the RCN against the Bill?

What is her opinion on the National Voice who, despite the rep on Newsnight, has a significant amount of unrest over the Bill?

What is your opinion of this statement?

&gt;As well as transferring powers from the Secretary of State to other bodies, the Bill leaves each CCG free to choose the patients for whom they have responsibility. Unlike PCTs, CCGs will not be responsible for all residents within contiguous geographical areas. CCGs select patients, initially assembling their patient populations on the basis of general practitioners' (GPs) lists; they will not have to cover everyone in a geographical area but only “persons for whom it [the CCG] has responsibility”. Nor will they be required to arrange for the provision of all the services that are currently part of the comprehensive health system. For example, accident and emergency services are not an explicit CCG responsibility under these proposals. Only a new category “of services or facilities for emergency care” will have to be provided for people in a CCG's area, which need not consist of adjoining or indeed whole electoral districts, as is the case with PCTs.

and this

&gt;These changes will have substantial legal consequences. First, the duty to provide a national health service throughout England would be lost if the Bill became law.9 It would be replaced by a duty on an unknown number of CCGs, not GPs, to arrange provision as they see fit for various sections of the population for which they are separately responsible. Second, CCGs would not be bound by the “duty to continue to promote a comprehensive free health service” when exercising their functions. Under present law, according to a judgment of the Court of Appeal, the Secretary of State “has the duty to continue to promote a comprehensive free health service and he must never, in making a decision [about services provided], disregard that duty”.10 Third, the Secretary of State's accountability to Parliament for the provision of services to patients in the new NHS will be diminished.4, 11

Do you think that the majority of health care professionals who have expressed an opinion on this bill are wrong, and if so, why? 

This is of great interest to me, since you are proposing to speak out in favour of the Bill, why should you be taken seriously in anonymity when those who forsaken theirs have been smeared or attempted to be discredited for doing so, especially in the light of Cameron's visit to Newcastle RVI, Lansley's pull out of visiting a hospital in Essex and this:

http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/newsarticle-content/-/article_display_list/13493575/bullying-claims-after-pct-warns-senior-doctor-over-health-bill-opposition

That's one example. There are also numerous examples of big (mainly US based) companies with less than positive reputations lobbying ministers in the run up to this legislation being proposed. Will you disclose any interests that you have which relate to this, as surely that is in the public interest.


But, the big question is: What do you have to hide and why haven't you come out earlier when other colleagues of yours have? Surely you have courage in your convictions and those of your colleagues to be respectful, professional and civil regardless of your political preferences? We've heard many voices in the MSM media speaking for the Bill. It's only recently that those against are getting time.

Lastly, from the same Lancet article, your thoughts on this:

&gt;In the USA, opposition to health reforms under both the Clinton and Obama administrations is articulated as erosion of personal freedom by increasing government powers.13 Conversely, pro-market reforms of universal health systems in Europe are often justified on the grounds that they increase personal freedom by transferring powers from government to non-governmental or commercial bodies and by increasing choice. Citizens' rights in democracies are underpinned not just by limitations on government powers but also by legal duties imposed on governments, such as those that guarantee citizens access to health care. The Bill would withdraw this legal underpinning.14 As the Bill enters its final critical stages it is crucial that Peers observe three red lines for the NHS (panel)15 and are fully aware of the key parts of the legislation that would abolish core NHS functions, if they are to safeguard the NHS for future generations.

I look forward to your responses.

Don't quote me on that. Carroll is still young and is improving a lot for LFC. He still hasn't hit the impressive form he exhibited at Newcastle which caused us to spend that 35 million on him, which I still think was far too much. But it's fair to say that he deserves the chance to prove his ability at Anfield. 

And in all honesty, this is Huntelaar's first good season in ages. I realize that neither Milan or Madrid exploited his skill to the fullest because they both played him on the wing, but this is the first season he's actually shown any signs of being a consistent talent. Perhaps as a full on purchase, we'd do well to get him, but I don't think I'd swap Carroll for him.

true,Alphaiv,null,null,"&gt;I'm curious as to why you are rejecting that, given references provided, her claim has been rejected on the ability to prove her sexuality. What else do you want?

Well for a start your links contain virtually no detailed information at all about this specific case so its very hard to say whether she is being rejected because of her ability to prove her sexuality. 

Did she come to the UK with her partner?

 Did she claim asylum due to her sexuality when she first arrived?


 Does she, as the Divamag link suggests, have evidence that ""she is threatened with rape and other torture if she is removed to India""?

Frankly im curious as to why you are so convinced that she is being rejected asylum solely because of her inability to prove her sexuality when it appears me that there could be any number of reasons for her claim being rejected.

&gt;Are you in all seriousness suggesting that we will have a flood of teh gays because we could look at asylum claims for what they are, instead of putting them on fast track to keep numbers down rather than going for non-legal immigrants that have not gone through the system?

I am suggesting that if UKBA has to take all asylum seekers who claim they face sexual persecution at their word then that is clearly a system that is very open to abuse from people who do not actually face persecution. As to fast tracking (and again I see nothing in any of the links that claim her case has been fast tracked), I agree that it is a poor situation and unfair on claimants who have complex situations however the system was brought in because of how overwhelmed UKBA were/are and the huge backlog that built up as a result. Considering that UKBA's budget is being cut by 20% as part of the spending cuts it appears impossible for it to give all asylum seekers the time and effort they deserve without letting another backlog develop and the increase in illegal immigration that entails and personally I believe that UKBA's main priority should be to limit illegal immigration even if the result is unfair on some genuine asylum seekers.",0,1330748948,null,0,false,0,c3x72zv,t3_qd7w3,t1_c3x72zv,t1_c3x5vpl,null,1428458933,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,PrincessKeona,dalek,Dalek,"Yay, I'm glad someone else feels this way! :) I just can't stop watching the new episodes, simply for the wonderful dynamic that the three of them have. Amy and the Doctor are not just best friends, she has known him literally almost her entire life. He is so ingrained in system that she has become a part of him completely, and knows him, I think, better than any other companion has ever known him. You see all these inside jokes between them later on that just warm my heart, and I love how she goes from crushing on him at first to later on poking fun at him. Like, when he has River's Astronaut helmet on and keeps saying how COOL this stuff is, and puts it on, and he goes ""Look how COOL this stuff is? What would you call this?"" Amy says ""An alien."" Like she's gotten past her crush and now basically thinks he's a total dork. LOL!!!

And I love the dynamic with Rory. He's SO in love with Amy, that he understands and respects that she has certain feelings for the Doctor also, and is confident enough to know that even though she's impressed and fascinated with the Doctor, at the end of the day, she's HIS girl and loves him more. I love how smart Rory is, how loyal and devoted he is and his unwavering love for Amy is just so sweet. 

These are the most well-developed companions I've seen so far, and I can't see how their bond can ever be broken. I just hope that they give them a nice, happy ending, and leave it open-ended enough so that we know the Doctor still has a relationship with them.",0,1330756325,null,0,false,0,c3x83ys,t3_qdpy3,t1_c3x83ys,t1_c3x59xp,null,1428459386,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2
