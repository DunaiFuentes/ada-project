Of course this may not be possible, since The Valeyard is supposed to be coming sometime after the 12th Doctor appears. Then again, The Valeyard is described [here](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Valeyard) as something separate from The Doctor, so maybe he is the result of The Doctor's redemption in a ""fall to darkness"" scenario?",0,1331460493,null,0,false,0,c3zu456,t3_qqd5a,t1_c3zu456,t3_qqd5a,null,1428504707,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Equal marriage - which will happen

Include it in our written constitution - unlikely given that the UK doesnt have a written constitution! The closest we have would be things like  the inclusion of the Human Rights Act into UK law.  I assume they're working on the definition that written constitutions cannot be changed by a simple majority - you might need a two thirds majority or something.  There is no provision for anything like this in the UK: Parliament can make, end and change laws with a simple majority.  That parliamentary sovereignty is the primary principle of the political system; to take away parliament's ability to do this would require a complete overhaul of the entire way British politics operates; parliament simply doesn't have the power or authority to remove its power to make and end laws from itself and future parliaments.  Parliamentary sovereignty means that whatever parliament can do, parliament can also reverse.  It's far more dramatic than House of Lords reform or anything like that, and it really has nothing to do with this particular issue.

Take away all the ridiculous hyperbole and you're left with ""Homosexuality used to be against the law."" which everybody knew anyway, and it was in most European states, and areas under the influence of the British Empire inherited UK Law, again, much like all other kinds of European Imperialism.

To call the UK the home of homophobia is just historically misleading.  If you can't make your point without resorting to distortion, don't bother making it at all.  According to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_LGBT_history#cite_note-32)

1250–1300 – Homosexual activity radically passes from being completely legal in the most of Europe to incurring the death penalty in most european states.[33]

1260 – In France, first-offending sodomites lost their testicles, second offenders lost their member, and third offenders were burned. Women caught in same-sex acts could be mutilated and executed as well.[12]

...

1483 – The Spanish Inquisition begins. Sodomites were stoned, castrated, and burned. Between 1540 and 1700, more than 1,600 people were prosecuted for sodomy.[12]

1533 – King Henry VIII passes the Buggery Act 1533 making all male-male sexual activity punishable by death.[37]

1553 – Mary Tudor ascends the English throne and removes all of the laws passed by Henry VIII.

1558 – Elizabeth I ascends the English throne and reinstates the sodomy laws.[12]

For a start the French system has much higher state contributions through taxation, is not free at the point of use (recall Lansley's repeated assertions that the Bill will retain this) and not competition based (unlike what is proposed in the Health Bill- you appear to be forgetting that, under the Bill, CCGs have no duty to secure comprehensive health services).

As previously stated, ""The bill also provides for health services to be arranged by local authorities, with provision for new charging powers for services currently provided free through the NHS (clauses 1, 12, 13, 17, and 49), and it will give the secretary of state an extraordinary power to exclude people from the health service.""

Again, this is more of your previous rhetoric, without any basis in fact. You say you are correct and just ignore the vast majority of professionals, staff, experts, commentators, analysts and information that say otherwise.

Also, the inference that the French system is not without serious problems or is 'better' than the NHS is also disingenuous. For a start it is bankrupt and moving towards the US system. 

Look at this BMJ report. See how the UK has the lowest spending on health per capita (and GDP) of all developed nations studied, but has the least barriers to access (that includes France) and the greatest patient satisfaction.

http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/42050/1/How_the_NHS_measures_up_to_other_health_systems_(LSERO).pdf

Note that it concludes that while further improvements are needed, their has been substantial  improvement in the last decade (after years of chronic under investment) and that reorganisation is not in the best interests of the NHS.

At risk of irking you further by providing an associated link (remember you chastised me that Reddit is not a ""scholarly journal"" some days ago), consider this:

&gt;In other areas GP referrals are being intercepted by referral facilitation services (a name that might have been invented by Orwell himself), also called ""referral gateways"", run by private firms. One of the first was in west London, where the American health insurer UnitedHealth has a contract to override GPs' judgments and tell patients to have physiotherapy or use more painkillers instead of seeing a specialist.

&gt;One west-London patient whose NHS surgeon had previously told her she needed a new knee, but who was denied it by UnitedHealth, had to pay over £1,000 and spend a year getting a scan and other surgeons' opinions to finally prove she needed it, and get back onto the NHS waiting list. But for many this is not possible. For them, free specialist services turn out not to be available.

&gt;Under the bill the range of what is available for free seems certain to contract further. Commissioning groups will have fixed budgets. The for-profit ""support organisations"" that are being lined up to do most of the commissioning for them will have a strong incentive to limit costs, and therefore the treatments to be paid for. CCGs also look likely to be free to decide that some treatments recommended by hospital specialists are ""unreasonably"" expensive, and refuse to pay for them, as health maintenance organisations do in the US.

&gt;A core of free NHS services will remain, but they will be of declining quality, because for-profit providers will cherry-pick the most profitable services. NHS hospitals will be left with the more costly work, so staffing levels and standards of care will be forced down and waiting times will get longer. To be sure of getting good healthcare people will increasingly take out private insurance, if they can afford it. At first most people will take out the cheaper insurance plans now on offer that cover just what is no longer free from the NHS, but gradually insurance for most forms of care will become normal. The poor will be left with a limited package of free services of lower quality.

Quite why you are so keen for this Bill in particular and apparently see no error in it is an odd position to so vigorously take.

As Lansley himself would say, ""Thanks for your support"".

&gt;When it comes to providing healthcare to its citizens, both the supply and the price of healthcare in Singapore is actively regulation by the Singaporean government, in both the public and the private sector in order to control costs and avoid the kind of significant inflationary pressures that pretty much every other healthcare system in the world has had to deal with...

&gt;Even those who commend Singapore’s health care system as a model from which other governments could learn concede that it would be [very difficult to replicate](http://www.watsonwyatt.com/europe/pubs/healthcare/render2.asp?ID=13850) elsewhere in the world because its a system that has been developed concurrently with the development of the country over a significant period of years against a backdrop of political ‘stability’ which is derived, in the main, from a culture of enforced political and social conformity to a degree that would be unthinkable in a Western liberal democracy such as the UK.

&gt;The country is relatively young: only around 8 percent of the population is over 65 years old, versus 13 percent in the U.S. Most European nations are even older.

&gt;A younger population that needs less care is more amenable to consumer-driven medicine. It’s the older people who suffer more when forced to pay medical costs out-of-pocket or out-of-savings, because they need more care. So more old people means more people needing care that exceeds their ability to pay, which results either in more government aid or more sick people—both of which drive up health care costs.

http://www.healthbeatblog.org/2008/07/health-care-in.html

&gt;A new survey of 1,000 doctors in four countries shows that doctors in Singapore are less satisfied with the quality of care they provide than their peers in other countries. The survey was conducted for Medicine and Liberty, an independent, non-partisan physician network, based in Switzerland.

&gt;Only 29% of Singaporean doctors are satisfied with the quality of healthcare they deliver, significantly fewer than their counterparts in the US and Switzerland (75% and 64% respectively). 30% of German doctors are satisfied with this area – comparable to Singapore.

&gt;However, most of Singapore doctors’ dissatisfaction is down to bureaucracy and other ‘nonclinical’ factors, with their biggest complaint being the limited amount of time they have to spend with each patient.

No.  Some people prefer drinking raw milk.  Should they be viewed as criminals?  I think most people would agree with you that pasteurization is the safe way to drink milk, but should it be imposed?  No.  Let the customers decide what they want.  Also, let lawsuits decide if it's worth a business producing raw milk.  If raw milk is so dangerous, any producers of it will be out of business in no time for dealing with incessant lawsuits and insanely high insurance premiums.

&gt; What about keeping diseased cows out of the supply chain?

Do you really think small dairy farmers have this problem?  They can easily keep up with their cows.  The guy in the article had 72, which is more than manageable.  Furthermore, all private enterprises have incentive to ensure that their product is of good quality for obvious reasons.  Those who slack on quality control eventually end up out of business.

&gt; We also have real world examples where one or two companies get very big and start to cause issues for producers.

I think more often than not, this doesn't happen in a true free market, but even if it does, it's for a good reason - it's because they're offering better quality and lower prices than the other businesses.  So long as they're not using coercion or force to gain their spot as ""top milk producer"", should we really be frowning on them because everyone voted to drink their milk?  Furthermore, look what's happening right now - with all of the regulation you talk about, the same problem is occurring.  Don't you think it's more likely that it would happen less if small businesses didn't have so much trouble gaining entry into the market?

&gt; Healthy competition...self regulation...volunteerism - these things to not come about!

Yes...they do.  It happens everyday in about 400 billion ways.  You just fail to realize that it's happening because it's so natural.

Also, what does ""self-regulation"" mean to you?

&gt; Meanwhile everyone in this thread cheerfully agreeing with pharsalus on the subject of competition in healthcare seems to have never heard of the US or spoken to an American who has used the US healthcare system.

You do realize the American healthcare system is not what we want.  We do not want a healthcare system run by corporations and standardized and regulated and licensed and government inflated to the point that it costs $250,000 to stick a god damn catheter through someone's coronary artery and drill out a blood clot.  I see these done all of the time...no way in hell it costs anywhere near this much in reality.  Every aspect of U.S. healthcare is this way - nothing costs anywhere near its actual value and it's precisely because of incessant government interference.

And let's not forget a *very* important fact...the United States healthcare system was the envy of the world not that long ago - back when it was largely left the hell alone.

It might only be since Victorian times recently, but particularly the last century it was there. If same sex couples (OK let's be explicit: It's men marrying men that is the issue. How often will you hear a Bishop etc. talk about the evils of women having sex with each other? It's all about the cock) are allowed to marry then society is saying it's OK for same sex couples to have sex.

Sex is evil! Sex is sinful! But it is also a beautiful gift from the LORD for procreation ONLY.

To grant same sex marriage is to acknowledge that sexual relations aren't just about procreation. And then doctrine begins to un-weave a little.

Also it's worth remembering that it appears many, many religious people have been taught/believe that homosexuality is simply about anal sex. Anal sex and blow jobs. They either don't want to or fail to understand that two *people* can love each other as much and as deeply as any two other *people*. I imagine there are numerous gay couples for which sex isn't even a regularly indulged activity. Whenever religious people are talking about homosexuals in a way you think a little unpalatable, consider for a second that they mean ""homosexual sex"", rather than ""two people of the same sex in love"". It might mean you understand them a little better. Not agree, but understand.

Finally: Allowing gay marriage will also further weaken the justification behind religious exemptions in equality laws. As it stands, numerous religious organisations can use their ""personal conviction"" that homosexuality is wrong to sack/not employ etc. gay people. If society further accepts homosexuality, then such exemptions will become more and more frowned upon.

&gt;*I feel that kidnapping for a few thousand people is fair different that the industrial scale subjection of millions of people, with 'science' developed to prove it, forced rape and then sterilisation, and using the legal system to separate two races based on lie*

You'd underestimated the number of Europeans captured and sold into slavery...and kind of ignored the even bigger slave trade going on over in the east.

Here's why, I think. The Left has a narrative that white European colonialism was *uniquely* bad; there is a residual Rosseauesque faith in the nobility of man in his 'uncivilised', un-industrialised, unmechanised form; and there is a visceral hatred of capitalism.

I take a broader view of history - and geography, if it comes to that. I don't see the West as uniquely horrible. Just a little more successful (touch and go with the Chinese for a few millenia, of course). I also see the values of the West as being ones we should defend, proudly.

Now of course all this is hedged about with all sorts of codicils. I couldn't help but ponder on that when I visited Thomas Jefferson's house, Monticello, a few years back. The man who had written the Declaration of Independence kept slaves, and even had children by one of them

The single payer based system (a state concept) is the most equitable, with some private care options available as a compliment (cosmetic etc).

The problem with niche-content TV in the UK is that the older model of advertising-based revenue just doesn't work any more as viewers are spread across way more channels than they used to be and advertisers have more choice as to where to place adverts.

The smaller channels often survive based on funds from phone-in/text services, by broadcasting for a limited number of hours per day, or by having backers with deep pockets. Channels like Current can't use the phone-in/text model, and so the only other route is advertising.

With advertising its a chicken-and-egg problem - you need funds to pay Virgin or Sky for uplink+EPG access, which you can only really get from advertisers once you can prove a number of viewers (and their demographic). And you can only get a decent number of viewers by advertising elsewhere and paying for/producing content. 

I'd like to see UK TV changed so that rather than these forthcoming local-tv channels, carriers had an obligation to carry a number of US-type public-access or niche-content channels at reduced rates.

You'll learn everything you need to know as you watch, without feeling like everything is being dumbed down for you.
I know a lot of people think you should watch one or two 'hook' episodes (usually Blink and The Girl in the Fireplace) and then go back to the start of the reboot, but I think you should start with the first episode of the reboot and watch it in order. It might take you a couple of episodes, but you'll get into it. It's just weird to jump around episodes because you see the characters in different stages of their relationships and it can sort of spoil the fun a bit. (I skipped a whole bunch of episodes because I didn't like a certain character, and then when another character that was introduced in that period came back to the show I didn't understand their character as well as I could have, which is sad, because I have an uber soft spot for both characters now that I've gone back and watched them, and I wish I had of seen all of what I saw in the first place rather than just skipping over it.)

&gt;Currently, the government is the monopoliser of healthcare. By subsidising the horribly inefficient NHS with it's ill-gotten gains, it undercuts any possible competition (save for private practices catering to the rich, who are so disgusted with the condition of the NHS that they'll happily pay extortionate fees for their healthcare).

Ill gotten gains?

Do you have evidence for the bold claim that the NHS is ""horribly inefficient""? Your claim about the rich is interesting as in a tiered system of private insurance based provision they would be subject to better treatment than those less well off, so I don't think your statement there really stands up.

&gt;Who exactly are the government accountable to right now? Itself? The electorate? Know who a private company is accountable to? It's customers. Pissed off with your health care provider? Go to a competitor. 

I agree, Govt should be more accountable to the electorate. I don't believe that by adding private sector interests into it is the best solution. For example, perhaps issues such as implementation of the Health Bill could be subject to referendum and be subject to prison for not following court rulings, such as that on the risk register.

&gt;Voting with your money is sure as hell more effective than voting in democracy when it comes to accountability.

That's only truly available to those with enough disposable income, as I previously went into. This makes a good fist of the issues with patient choice:

http://nhsvault.blogspot.com/2011/08/choice-and-competition.html

&gt;For example, if you choose the exact day (and time of day) to have your cataract replaced, the provider has to have a timeslot available for you to choose it. The provider cannot guess what time you will choose and consequently to plan ahead (and ensure there will be the staff and theatre time) they have to provide over-capacity. They also have to have over-capacity to accommodate patients who switch providers, again, something they cannot accurately predict. This over-capacity means that more facilities and staff will have to be available than is actually needed, and this has a cost...

&gt;The problem is that the free-at-the-point-of-use system is not a free market, so it is not possible to use a discount to persuade a patient to choose another time. So if we have real choice of providers those providers must run at excess capacity. The cost of this over capacity is money that could be spent on more healthcare, and as we suffer more rationing (that no one voted for) there will be political pressure for providers to cut costs.

&gt;If I get a poor service from, say, my GP and I decide to register with another GP, will that raise the quality of my previous GP? No, of course not, I am merely one patient. Do I now want to raise the quality of my previous GP? I have a new GP who I am happy with so the quality of the old GP is of no interest to me - why should I care? Of course, over time there may be other patients who decide to move away from that GP, but the important point is that it is over a length of time. It may take months or years before a threshold is reached when the practice realises that that particular GP is simply not popular. During this time more patients will get a poor service. Is it acceptable to allow patients to have a poor service over a long time?

and not only but also:

http://nhsvault.blogspot.com/2012/01/more-selective-research-from-government.html

&gt;The reference [43] is to work carried out by the RAND Corporation published by the Health Foundation. This report compares the results of papers published since 2000 on the effects of publishing performance data on improvements of hospitals. The NYC example interested me:

&gt; *research in the early 1990s showed the impact of public reporting of mortality rates in New York; those physicians and hospitals publishing better health outcomes subsequently saw their market share grow*

&gt;This seems to contradict the statement that Prof Gwyn Bevan made to the Health Select Committee in November 2010:

&gt; *There are systematic reviews in the United States for putting information out on a hospital's performance. They consistently find that people do not switch from poor to high-performing hospitals. One of the paradoxes about the New York study where they issued data on risk-adjusted mortality rates for cardiac surgery is that patients continued to go to hospitals with high mortality rates. But by publishing the information, the hospitals got better. The most famous case is Bill Clinton, who had his quadruple bypass in a hospital that the information said at the time was one of the two worst outliers in the whole of New York State he could have gone to.*

&gt;The Making Open Data Real document says that physicians and hospitals that published the better data saw their market share increased, so if Prof Bevan is right that would imply that there must have been a lot more patients (ie the overall number of patients increased) since those with worst results saw no change in the number of patients.

More on competition a bit later.


&gt;A private company is bound by contract to honour the terms of the contract. If you or your insurer has a contract with a health care provider that states ""if I call this number, an ambulance has to be with me in 10 minutes"", then an ambulance has to be there within 10 minutes if you call that number.


That's assuming that you'll have a contract which states that, and frankly the idea that an Ambulance would be with you in ten minutes every single time is totally unrealisitic. Notice Lansley on this very issue:
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-12013202

&gt;""We have to have something that measures genuine quality and outcomes"".
Hmmmm.

I doubt any insurer that would make a guarantee that is so open to failure. Also, you know people have sued providers etc in the NHS? They aren't immune from legal action and suggesting that private providers wouldn't be able to attempt to smother legal action through extensive lawyering up is a tad feeble. Are you also suggesting that there is not abuse in the private system? The US certainly isn't alien to it, look at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_fraud  and Unum cheating Americans out of welfare benefits http://www.whywaitforever.com/dwpatosveterans.html#unumbbc. I fear you are being dreadfully naive in your assuming the best of private insurance. People with long-standing conditions (e.g., diabetes) find under most private policies that “pre-existing conditions are excluded”. 

There's also a veritable litany of examples and critiques of competition in health care here. Here is the killer paragraph summary 

&gt;What seems clear from international experience is that markets lead to ‘islands of excellence in a sea of misery’. America and South Africa give good, if extreme examples*. They have the best possible care for those who can afford it and the bare minimum for many who cannot.

It also (scroll to the end of the article) highlights how it has been overwhelmingly the US insurance companies attempting to gain entry into the NHS. 

http://abetternhs.wordpress.com/2011/06/29/competition/

&gt;So could the government.

I'm not hard headedly against hospital closures and think some need to be closed down. It's a hard, emotive, pragmatic fact. This goes back to the point that a lot of those who are currently rubbishing opponents of the Bill on Reddit.

There needs to be some reform, but not this reform. It's a bad Bill.

I liked Sherlock, but after my girlfriend pointed out how (dickish the character was and) deus ex machina the plot was, I couldn't get her to watch past the first episode. I've seen the rest but her criticisms (which I'm not articulating very well) still holds. One of the things she didn't like was how much Sherlock was like Moffat's version of the Doctor -- it was great in Matt Smith's first few episodes (I'm thinking that park details scene) but later, to her the Doctor (as with Sherlock) suddenly pulling an answer he couldn't possibly have know from thin air was just lazy writing. She's a brilliant person, and to see the Doctor/Sherlock go from situation A to conclusion E without B,C,D is, to her, insulting to the viewer. And Moffat's run on both shows does this *a lot.*

I enjoy the ride, I'm a Doctor Who fan. We sat down and are watching through RTD's run of the show, and I've had us skip a few episodes here and there. RTD was so good at ratcheting up the drama, piling on danger after danger and leaving things at maximum 'no hope' that when the Doctor finally fixed things at the end of the episodes you felt that journey with him. But most importantly what has been striking me during this round of rewatching them is that *there is an internal logic that isn't violated by some impossible knowledge or action by the Doctor.* It's all foreshadowed a bit and doesn't feel forced. 

We are up to *The Shakespeare Code* and to me, there's that one line, that one moment, when the Tenth Doctor just suddenly falls into cheeky inappropriate pop culture references and that bogs down the show from then on. I'm referring to the ""Good ol' J.K.!"" line. And I know expressing this here may bring about a tonne of people saying ""but that's what I liked about the show!"" but to me it cheapens the character and the show and it's just horrid twaddle that infects the episodes that came later in RTD's run. Some of them make me twinge, but that line is the first that really makes me *groan*. I know there's lots more coming in the 3rd, 4th season as we rewatch them, too.

But to a certain extent, the 11th Doctor carries that bad pop culture reference mantle even further, and added to Moffat's way of equating being brilliant with *pulling an answer out of your ass* and how much the Doctor's sonic screwdriver really, really is now just a magic wand...

...by the Rod of Rassilon, I'll keep watching. But I hope the writing gets better. Doctor Who should be creating the pop culture, not regurgitating it. Better scripts, please!

&gt;Q3:         Isn’t the Bill necessary because health outcomes in the UK lag far behind those in other countries, as government spokesmen have told us?

&gt;A:            No.  It is true that some outcomes, such as the government’s key population outcome measure, avoidable mortality, have historically lagged behind other comparable countries.  This reflects previous underfunding of our system relative to other European countries and especially compared to the USA.  Following sustained investment since 1999, and supported by targeted initiatives such as the National Cancer Plan, these outcome measures have now improved markedly[12].  A recent OECD report[13] showed that the rate of decline in avoidable mortality in the UK was the second fastest of all industrialised countries.

&gt;No-one at all has offered any suggestion on how or why market reform of the NHS would improve population health outcomes; in fact all available evidence points to the opposite result.

My proposal would be that the government tends to the legal concept of marriage, ending new civil partnerships in favour of marriage as the sole legal structure of union between two or more people. At the same time those in civil partnerships are given the means to move to marriage for those that want it, or to keep the existing status if they prefer. I'd also extend rules regarding common law marriage to be independent of gender or orientation, provided that a loving relationship of a sexual nature has been established.

With regard to the religious concept of marriage, that would be solely down to the religion. Under my proposal no-one would be issued a marriage licence other than a registry office.

&gt;Under the Freedom of Information Act, The IoS obtained answers from more than 80 institutions. The responses revealed a catalogue of offences, including individuals caught taking exams for someone else, using concealed notes or taking mobile phones into examination halls and ""colluding"" with fellow students to produce identical coursework.

&gt;Hundreds were kicked off their courses, while many more have been fined, had their marks downgraded, or been sent for counselling.

* Collusion- very easy to be done for collusion, especially in first year of Uni. In science courses for example you do experiments in pairs of groups, your data is identical which is fine, what isn't ok is if you work together to write it up, or discuss what to put in your conclusions. If you both get the same thing wrong it sticks out and you get reported for collusion. 

* Mobile phones in exams, you are told repeatedly not to have phone on you, but some people do still forget, and unintentionally have it in their pocket. if they are then caught with it when leaving, they can still be done for misconduct even if they haven't used phone in exam. 

* Plagiarism, if you don't reference properly, or fully you can be done for plagiarism. Referencing is a skill that is learn over time, but one small mistake can still be counted as misconduct. 

* ""Hundreds were kicked off courses"" that only really happens in the most serious cases of gross misconduct, or repeated incidents. Out of the figured quoted in the article, is is miniscule. 

The Turnitin software is not that great. Students have access to the Turnitin tool to help with worries over plagiarism, but it is really it flags up just about everything. At present our lecturers do not use it. because as they say they can do a more effective and quicker job themselves, but I know some Uni's have a rule where all essays have to be put through Turnitin first.

No, that's why I object to government so strenuously.  It denies exactly that.  Object to my position?  Then reconcile aggressive war with civilization. Reconcile the enforcement of preferences (example: the drug war) creating the logical perversion of ""victimless crime"" with civilization.

&gt;Again, like with the ""robbed at gunpoint"" is emotionally deceptive. It's very much in keeping with, mainly, libertarians who hold the equation taxation equals theft as a proven fact.

I just showed how taxation meets the dictionary definition of theft.  

&gt;Where's the evidence of private interests providing better public services? Certainly markets work in some areas, but in others they demonstrably flail, e.g., rail and health care.

As someone who lives in the states, my examples will be from the US, but economics are universal, so my examples will meet topicality.  When the government deregulated parcel delivery, UPS, FedEx, and DHS came into existence and are blowing the doors off of the USPS (us postal service), which is running an $8 billion annual deficit. The three private companies provide service which people voluntarily prefer, on price, quality of service, etc.  Obviously, the three private companies are turning a profit, as they continue operating.  

Regarding the unsatisfactory price of healthcare, I would have to cite government involvement, invalidating any claims that markets have been allowed to work.  Kel Kelly of the Mises institute put out a great article on his research of the healthcare market, and he discovers that the government has artificially constrained the supply of doctors, floating profit and causing the extremely high cost of healthcare.  http://mises.org/daily/5066

Freedom from slavery, or by another name, anarcho capitalism.  A fine video by the author of ""The Machinery of Freedom"" covers many of the problems people see with non-slavery.

Not a fan of labels, but for expediency:

* [**Voluntarism**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntaryism), or voluntarism, is a philosophy according to which all forms of human association should be voluntary. This moral principle is called the non-aggression principle, which prohibits the initiation of aggressive force or coercion. The word 'initiation' is used here to make clear that Voluntarism does not oppose self-defense.
* **[The Non-Aggression Principle](http://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Principle_of_non-aggression)** is an ethical stance which asserts that ""aggression"" is inherently illegitimate. ""Aggression"" is defined as the ""initiation"" of physical force against persons or property, the threat of such, or fraud upon persons or their property. In contrast to pacifism, the non-aggression principle does not preclude (proportional) violent self-defense.

In short, if there is a way problems can be solved without 'aggression' *(involuntary relationships)*, I find that to be preferable.

&gt;The high costs to the NHS of servicing the annual PFI debt charges and absence of proof of value for money are well documented. However, until recently the true scale of the profits has been hidden from view with ""commercial confidentiality"" exemptions being invoked in response to freedom of information requests. The recent release of the Royal Infirmary Edinburgh and Hairmyres hospital contracts in Scotland and their analysis by Jim and Margaret Cuthbert show shareholders will reap dividends of £168m on an equity stake of £500,000 for the infirmary, and £89m on an equity stake of £100 for Hairmyres hospital - rich rewards for so little risk. The estimated fees, additional interest charges and shareholder dividends amount to more than three times the cost under public procurement. In other words, the taxpayer gets one PFI hospital for what three public hospitals would have cost...

&gt;Politicians, meanwhile, unite in the fiction of an unaffordable NHS. We are never told about the impact of the market or how the huge injection of cash into the NHS is being diverted into marketing, billing, invoicing, chief executive-level salaries, profits, shareholders' returns and bank dividends. Nor is the public told how budgetary controls that made the NHS the most cost-efficient health system in the world are being dismantled in the rush to market.

We appear to disagree on a fundamental level. Equating things like universal health care etc with slavery is just too...Rand Paul for me. As for David Friedman, he's way too right wing for me. This article sums some of my feelings up on it/right-libertarianism

http://liberalconspiracy.org/2011/04/17/why-i-became-a-left-libertarian/

&gt;But to an increasing number of self-described libertarians, myself included, the “right wing” libertarians of the LPUK/LPUS are quietly abandoning the doctrinaire “virtue of selfishness” model of freedom advocated by the Capitalist Libertarians who insist on the productive wonders of hierarchial, wealth concentrating and politically powerful private corporations.

&gt;The left-libertarian, on the other hand, prefers to recognise these economic powerhouses as what they are: the beneficiaries of near invisible State subsidies in a variety of forms.

&gt;These subsidies include
- artificial property rights,
- a regulatory system that benefits large, established players at the expense of smaller suppliers,
- subsidising of long-distance transportation at the expense of local enterprise more able to adapt supply to demand,
- and overhead capital costs made so high that most regular people are unable to ever go into business themselves.Capitalism as we know it couldn’t survive without the state; “free market” capitalism is an oxymoron. In reality, capitalism – even anarcho-capitalism – is in effect, privatised feudalism.

This is *all* that matters. It doesn't matter how much the community supports it, if you're do something illegal then you're gonna have to stop doing it.  

&gt;Is it ethical that the guy that made a movie about it and made billions of dollars from it tries to force a little pub in Southampton, that's beloved of many many people to spend thousands of pounds on changing its name

Yes, absolutely. The guy paid to own those rights, and make billions of dollars from it- it's not like he did nothing to deserve them, at all. Keep in mind that this man would never have even come to own the rights if Tolkein had not put them on the market. This is a direct result of the person whose images the pub use's actions.

&gt;(which will involve a lot of expensive and complicated legal work,

The pub was painted without the permission of the copyright holder, and the paintings have been in violation of the copyright from the moment they went up. They've been in breach of the law the whole time, and they're *entirely* responsible for that.

&gt; which would also inconvenience employees as they would have to explain to future potential employers that they had, in fact, worked for the same pub for x years but that it had been forced to change its name)?

That would be the pub's fault for plagiarizing, not the fault of the person they plagiarized from's for being against it.

&gt;I acknowledged elsewhere that it hadn't been around longer. However, for all that time before the movie, there was not a single problem.

Perhaps the previous holder didn't know about the place, or was more lenient.

&gt;but to the word of mouth necessary to spread recommendations

Again, that's the pub's fault for calling itself after something it shouldn't, not the fault of the process correcting that.

Look, I realise that the pub's probably a nice place, and that the staff that are there at the moment may well have nothing to do with the paintings. I realise that re-decorating is going to cost a lot of money. But that's *not* because this guy is randomly attacking for no good reason. It's because at best, the place is using the images wrongly, and at worst they're profiting from it for free, when the guy actually put money into being able to do that. If you do something wrong, and someone makes you pay for it, it's your fault for doing something wrong, not theirs for making you pay. Painting the pub was wrong, not making people pay for it.

Well, I suppose that would probably be a load of effort. Every time the rights were sold on, or someone bought a share of them, the pub would have to be included in contracts as a source of income. This one place might not be so bad, but if people see it and decide that they're going to set up their own themed pubs, then things are going to get messy.

&gt;Someone made a mistake 20 years ago. It just hurts my belief in people so much to know that now other people are being punished for it.

This is an inference based on one sentence present taken out of context as fact. The actual letter itself shows more of a general dislike towards those who wielded power or attempted to be glorious leaders rather than firmly putting him in the anarchist camp. So by extension you could label many people who dislike over reaching governments as anarchists using the same metric you apply to this letter.

Flim and Flam, obviously just following the market like any capitalist business, portrayed as skeezy snake-oil salesman and run out of town. Discord, master of chaos. Treated as a villian and sealed in the same ineffective stone casing he was originally imprisoned in (as that worked so well the first time) instead of attempting to reform him.

On the other hand Harry Potter conveys the moral greyness of Snape (a passionate tale that rivals most others) and the muddled not-quite-redemption of Draco. We see all sides being affected and it's not a moral black-and-white.

Doctor Who has a *very* grey morality. The Doctor has caused genocide and has met species that have brought up the question of what is life and what deserves to live.

My Little Pony has *never* even briefly been that deep, sticking to tried and tired storybook tales like ""reading isn't lame"" and ""sometimes pranks go too far"" that *every* show has already done a million times over.

MLP doesn't let you know the motiviations behind say Discord because it doesn't need to. The show's a parade of cliches and simplicities. It's not trying to be an epic or something moving or something hilarious. IT's trying to be a commercial, plain and simple.

Since throwing bombs isn't really what any modern anarchist means by anarchism, I tend to view him as a (somewhat odd) brother.

Your broader points just tend to show your lack of understanding of anarchism.  The whole philosophy is pretty much predicated on the power-corrupts tenet.  Anyone who hates power is tending towards anarchy.  How far you head down that road may vary, but it's an anarchist road, if you take it to its logical philosophical conclusion, welcome to the club.  There's no flaw in my argument, because I didn't really make one, there isn't a logical way to determine who is an anarchist sympathsiser and who isn't, just a sense of affinity.

They need to be fed.  They need to be washed.  It requires a **phenomenal** amount of resources to look after even one person that can't do anything for themselves.

true,osianjones25,lfc12,,"I think a big part of it is that the team has seen a big change in the Dalglish era. A lot of new faces have come in to our starting 11 and we should allow time for them to learn how to play as a group. 

Adam, Bellamy, Downing, Henderson, Suarez, Carroll, Enrique are all potential starting 11 players for us and they have all had times at past clubs where they looked fantastic or looked like the biggest 'up and coming' players. I think Kenny made a point of the signings being for the long term (Andy and Suarez signed 5 and a half year deals) and didn't expect to be challenging for top this season but was maybe hopeful of a Champions league spot. 

Downing wasn't a big scorer for Aston Villa scoring 9 in 63 Permier league apps (2 in his first season for Villa). He was always fast and dangerous on the wing though but only got 8 assists. Statistically he's underperformed at Liverpool without a doubt but I think expecting a load of goals from him was unrealistic. He's getting into it a bit more now though, he's had a great few games for us but he's not been the wizard on the wing that I'd hoped he would be.

Adam scored 12 in 34 in his last season at blackpool however only 2 of them were in open play, 10 were penalties and free kicks so when you take that penalty and free kick taking duty away from him he's not a big scorer. He did get a lot of assists (36% of blackpools goals included him as the scorer or assist when he was there), his free kick and corner delivery has been shocking for us though considering how brilliant they were for Blackpool. When most of the corners hit the first man or sail to the far corner of the box you can't blame that on the squad's chemistry and for a Professional footballer on about a million a year you'd expect better from him. 

tl;dr - Don't expect too much too soon. They've not been playing together as a team for long enough to be a consistent threat week in week out (even though they are professional footballers and should be able to sort themselves out). They weren't huge goal scorers at their last club and without the free kick and penalty role that's even less.

Copyright *just is* a legal monopoly - you, as the creator, get legally granted a *monopoly* on production of instances of your work - you are the *only one* who can legally produce it (or anyone you assign your right to).

The argument against long copyright is as follows:

You don't have any obvious moral right to stop people copying you. The *only* justification for that right is that it encourages innovation. But it's implausible to think that a 70 year copyright is justified by that. So it's implausible that copyright is morally justified.

This is a straw man argument; I'm not saying that the law is right, and that is not my justification for this being ethical. Better would be:

Frank decides to give Ben a bar of chocolate in exchange for a piece of gum. Ben then gives the chocolate to Susan in exchange for a care bear themed lunchbox. Harry breaks off a piece of the chocolate without asking Susan, claiming that it wasn't much chocolate and he doesn't want it anyway.

It follows from that that Susan is ethically entitled to eat all the chocolate herself. because Frank made an agreement with Ben, then Ben made one with Susan, She's now the owner of the Chocolate. At no stage was anyone forced to do anything.

Whether IP should or should not exist is outside the confines of this discussion, because this discussion is not about the legal groundings of such a system, it's about the property of whoever owns the rights, whether it's being impinged upon, and whether the usage would fall under fair use.

DWP response

I should first clarify that illegal immigrants are by definition unable to claim or qualify for any benefits whatsoever as they are usually living in the UK unknown to the relevant authorities.
There is no standard benefit that asylum seekers can receive in the way suggested by the information you have received. Since 3 April 2000, asylum seekers who require assistance are offered support by way of a cash
allowance for living expenses and in some cases, accommodation. This scheme is administered by the Home Office’s Asylum Support Service. The weekly asylum support rates from April 2011 are £36.62 for a single person and £72.52 for a couple over age 18.
The United Kingdom is a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. As a consequence we must fully honour our obligation to consider all applications for asylum made in this country or at our ports. In order to qualify for asylum a person must be outside his or her country of nationality and have a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.
In the event of an asylum seeker being granted refugee status, they are subject to the same rules of entitlement to benefit, and rates of benefit, as United Kingdom citizens.",0,1331509495,null,0,false,0,c3zzvha,t3_qs4l3,t1_c3zzvha,t3_qs4l3,null,1435732662,30,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,30

Can you clarify this?  If I did my own painting of a wizard would that be in breach of copyright if it looked a bit like Gandalf?  Because from the images you can see that the images don't include any character's names and aren't reproductions of any copyrighted art, but are just inspired by the text and painted by local artists.  From my understanding of copyright law, with regards to the art there's no legal issue.

Now another issue is that of character names in the books.  If you own the copyright/trademark for The Hobbit, do you then own trademarks for all the character names in the book?  That seems unlikely but again I may be wrong.

If I am right in both of these cases the only issue would be the pub name of ""The Hobbit"".  While this could be a problem I'm sure they could easily change the name of the pub to ""The Prancing Pony"" or something else similar, and keep the artwork.

Aguero earns 6 million more a year than Carroll does, so over the life of that contract the club is spending an added 30 million. Also, we are not the power house we once were and without Champions League football, attracting players of that calibre will be much more difficult. 

What I find the most troubling is the continued statement that Henderson and Carroll are improving, when in reality, they are performing worse than they did under their previous clubs. Despite what people are now saying, the goal of this season was Champion's League qualification. The owners said it, Kenny said it, senior players have said it. We can tell ourselves that this has been a season of improvement, but when our prospects have actually declined in performance and we have not reached our league goals, the only thing that should stop us from calling this season a failure is foolish pride.

As for Kenny, I am frustrated and bewildered with him, too. That aside, we would gain **nothing** from sacking him. Unlike with Hodgson, he still is adored by most of our fans and that goes a long, long way with Liverpool.

We are still in Europe next year. We still have another trophy. As for the league? Well, maybe things have to get worse before they can get better.

Torres for leaving on the last day of the transfer window. By doing that he left us needing to find a replacement quickly. This meant we couldn't spend time scouting for options. It also meant we didn't have much time to negotiate on a price. 

At the time Carroll was somewhat proven in the league. He had a very good first half of the season for Newcastle which lead us to looking at him. Remember our other new striker (Suarez) was completely unproven in our league so we couldn't rely on just him - even if in hindsight we would have been fine not replacing Torres until the summer. 

Newcastle (and everyone) just saw us get £50million for Torres. Therefore they knew we had a lot of money to spend in looking for a replacement. And not much time to do it in. They used this to their advantage so put the £35m pricetag on Carroll because they knew they could.

&gt;When using quotes or extracts, there is no magic figure or percentage that can be applied as each case must be viewed on its own merit. In cases that have come to trial what is clear is that it is the perceived importance of the copied content rather than simply the quantity that counts.

   .
&gt;Can you clarify this? If I did my own painting of a wizard would that be in breach of copyright if it looked a bit like Gandalf?

To my knowledge, as long as you don't sell or distribute that painting, you aren't breaching any laws. If you are, they're really stupid laws.

&gt;From my understanding of copyright law, with regards to the art there's no legal issue.

That would be the case if there was no other reason to believe it.

&gt;Now another issue is that of character names in the books. If you own the copyright/trademark for The Hobbit, do you then own trademarks for all the character names in the book? 

That's another grey area, I think- obviously, it would be ridiculous if single words or phrases were copyrighted. Simultaneously it would be ridiculous if you could just take entire chapters and sell them yourself.  
The chances are that in addition to film rights, this guy also owns the title ""the Hobbit"" meaning that he can prove infringement on some level.

If I were them, my solution would definitely be to change the name/remove direct references rather than redecorate the whole place.

Look at Man City. They got their cash injection in 2008. And while only really buying Robinho they only finished 10th that season. 

That summer they spent over £100m trying to build a new team (Barry, Kolo, Lescott and Tevez) as well as spending on players that have now been all but dropped (Santa Cruz, Adebayor, Tevez). Again they failed to get into the top 4 that season (5th place). 

Another transfer window came and they spent again (Silva, Yaya, Kolarov, Milner, Balotelli, Dzeko and Milner). Doing enough to win the FA Cup and finishing in the Top 4. 

They've spent again since then (Aguero, Nasri, Clichy) finally getting a team that's properly challenging for first. 

And we have a fraction of the money backing City. So instant success isn't something any of us should be expecting. It takes time. If we don't remember that we're no better than Chelsea.

Doctor Who has a lot of character interaction and development. The Doctor wondering if he's doing the right thing, interacting with his companions and taking responsibility for them while coming to terms with the Time War.

Both shows showed the characters more deeply than the superficialities MLP treats us to. We see characters *really* develop, *really* make tough decisions and come together and help each other. MLP just applies a lot of cliches and stereotypes instead of showing us real and well-rounded characters.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"Drawing on some points made earlier...

&gt;Also, we are not the power house we once were and without Champions League football, attracting players of that calibre will be much more difficult.

I think is a big part of the problem. We lacked a bit of leverage and ultimately overspent on a lot of players (Downing, Henderson, Adam, Carroll). We were in a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.

Try and be fiscally prudent? Then we don't get the aforementioned players and we scream about how we did nothing.

And how could Liverpool possibly stand pat and do nothing?

Point is, we're still a better squad on paper (both now and in the future) than we were a year ago.


&gt;Look at Man City. They got their cash injection in 2008. And while only really buying Robinho they only finished 10th that season.

I think this is a valuable point too. I must admit, I think with all of our new signings, I thought a top 4 finish was very, very likely. But it does take time for these players to really get to know each other and play like a team. Teams like Man City, Man United, Barcelona, etc weren't built in a day (or a season).


&gt;We went from quick football to stagnant one directional football that makes us easy to defend. to me that's the managers fault.

I think this is the part that I struggle with the most. It's a players v. tactics question, to me.

Is it the fault of the tactics? Or the inability of the players to execute the tactics? Is Dalglish not getting the best out of our players? Or are our players not playing to the best of their ability?

I think it's a combination of both ...

With Dalglish's first full season as manager with a new-look team, I think he more than deserves to see out his contract.

Undoubtedly this season has been extremely frustrating with the highs of a League Cup win and the lows of our League performance.

If there was pressure now on the players and the coaching staff, wait until next season when there'll likely be more new players and even higher expectations.

As frustrating as things have been... I do feel as if we're slowly moving forward. I hope.

true,[deleted],null,null,"(1) Even countries that do recognize same sex unions and same sex marriage will not necessarily recognize UK same sex unions. There's no internationally accepted definition of a civil union - it's literally something the UK made up so gay people would have some form of partnership that didn't upset christians. Marriage is internationally defined as the standard way to recognize a relationship.

(2) Married status is just as important when you're overseas as when you're at home. Simple example - say two UK civil partners are on vacation to Spain and one gets sick. One would not necessarily be able to visit the other in hospital. Or say they decide to settle down in Canada. Again, their relationship would not be recognized as the same thing as marriage, even though Canada respects same sex marriage.

[For example](http://www.xtra.ca/public/National/UK_civil_union_is_not_marriage_feds-10873.aspx)

&gt; Hincks and his partner, both Canadian citizens, were joined in a civil union in the UK before returning to Canada to live. But when the relationship ended and he tried to file divorce proceedings, he was informed that his civil partnership wasn’t equivalent to a civil marriage under Canadian law.
 
&gt; “Please be advised that the Attorney General of Canada will be intervening in this proceeding to oppose the issuance of a declaration that a civil partnership registered in the United Kingdom is a ‘marriage’ for the purpose of the Civil Marriage Act and that the parties to such a partnership are spouses within the meaning of the Divorce Act,” reads the letter from Nicholson’s office.

In other words, the situation's a mess because the UK's refusing to use the standard, internationally recognized definition of marriage. Basically a UK civil partnership confers many but not all as the same rights as marriage - it's a second-class institution designed to keep gays away from actual marriage. 

Finally even if it were just the same in terms of rights it would still be unacceptable, discriminatory and second-class.

true,JamesM_,eng-durham,Durham,"&gt; Marriage is not a religious institution so no, you're completely wrong. It's not theirs. It long predates Christianity, it's a human institution which religion attempted to control.

Not really - Of course it predates Christianity - I'm more thinking about marriage in Judaism which carried over into Christianity. Do you have anything older than the books of the old testament for evidence?

&gt; Would you feel comfortable with a preacher preaching about the dangers of allowing black people to marry white people because it would corrupt marriage and the nation's morals?

No.

&gt; It's exactly the same,

I don't think it is. Religious people see marriage as a religious institution. Whether you think it is or is not is kind of moot - maybe it was, maybe it wasn't - but in the 13th-18th centuries the legal and religious process was unified. Yes, we've taken a split again and diverged the two processes, but the fact that ""marriage"" as a term, token and action is a religious ceremony still has credence if not truth.

Religious types don't think homosexuality is right under God. Marriage is a union of two people under God. Therefore, homosexuals cannot marry in the religious sense.

If you think about it in cold hard logic the conclusion does make sense, and all you're left with is ""is marriage a religious thing?"" ""What is marriage? union? union in a church? some other type of union?"" or, trying to convince religious types that homosexuality isn't wrong.

But that would be a losing battle, because even though most won't lift a finger or say anything against homosexuals going about their lives (who is man to judge?) most do believe that they are wrong.

The fact that religious people feel that marriage is a religious thing is no more valid than secular people feeling that it isn't religious. The religious should not be allowed a pedestal for their beliefs just because they are religious, that's bullshit. If anyone gets priority for their beliefs it should be the people who found them with reason and logic instead of childish fairy tales.

And sure it's been seen as religious for a long time but that changes. Marriage doesn't *need* to have any religious component or faith for it to still be meaningful and worthwhile. If you want to make a call to tradition then we should go back to women as property and take away all their rights, no? That's probably easy to justify with some religious book.

&gt;And if you believe in a divine creation, where everything was created for a reason, then the complementarity of female and male genitalia would seem like the obvious ""intended way to do it"".

You brought up the idea of cold hard logic and cold hard logic says that creation myths and intelligent design are nonsense, they are not appropriate for basing societal norms and laws on. 

We have much better ways to explain the 'complementarity' of female and male bodies and it doesn't say anything about who should be allowed to marry who.

The fact that we think male and female seems to fit so well together is not going to change anyone's sexuality and isn't really relevant since marriage is a human-social construct, not something dictated by nature. 

In most societies the rules about who can marry whom typically come about from what works at the time, especially with regard to inheritance and property. Monogamy occurs when two people are needed to raise a child. Multiple wives or general promiscuity happens more when resources are plentiful. In some places resources are so scarce that a woman will marry several brothers so that they have a chance at managing to raise some children and won't have to split their property.

 Property and inheritance are the common theme here though, marriage and control over female sexuality is about ensuring that men know they are raising and passing their property onto their own children only.

 Gay couples who want to marry could also argue that they are complementary to each other and god made them so. And they too might want to raise children. 

&gt;or, trying to convince religious types that homosexuality isn't wrong.

&gt;But that would be a losing battle, because even though most won't lift a finger or say anything against homosexuals going about their lives (who is man to judge?) most do believe that they are wrong.

Actually I don't know if it's right to say that most religious people find homosexuality to be wrong, there can be a lot of arguing in either direction.

Most of us don't have the access to debate with politicians. We have to register our views by taking to the streets or participating in email campaigns or similar. Our views get ignored but at least the greasy MPs are forced to be aware of public opinion. 

If nothing else, it helps to shine a light on the sheer irrelevance of public opinion when you are governed by parties that represent an alarmingly narrow spectrum of opinion. It helps to illuminate how little interaction there is between the government's operatives and the wishes of the governed. Perhaps it even shows the very concept of a public consensus or public opinion to be an irrelevant factor in today's politics. 

Ultimately, the government can do whatever it likes and no one can stop it. This is becoming more obvious to some of us. Whether or not a large enough number of people will dig this, who can say? And if they do, will they give a shit? And if they give a shit will any changes be brought about?

true,JamesM_,eng-durham,Durham,"My argument and general stance on this issue revolves around the definition of marriage, and its distinction from civil partnership.

More specifically, I am of the understanding that *legally*, there is no difference between civil parnership and marriage, in that a couple getting married has the same final rights under the legal system as those getting a civil parnership.

Now, if that understanding is false, then my view is to revamp civil parnership such that it holds. But if it is true, then:

&gt; The fact that religious people feel that marriage is a religious thing is no more valid than secular people feeling that it isn't religious.

No. Marriage under the law is different to marriage under God, and the fact that the same term is used to mean different things is clouding the fact. ""Marriage"" as to which Christians refer is a superset of marriage as referred to by law, in that you get legally married and also make a commitment to each other under the eyes of God.

&gt; If anyone gets priority for their beliefs it should be the people who found them with reason and logic instead of childish fairy tales.

Spoken like a true atheist. Does it not occur to you that others see things differently?
 
&gt; You brought up the idea of cold hard logic and cold hard logic says that creation myths and intelligent design are nonsense, they are not appropriate for basing societal norms and laws on.

No, I gave a set of assumptions and a conclusion based on those assumptions. That is using logic. That does not therefore imply that the assumptions upon which the predicate was based had to have been logically deduced. I was providing a logical reasoning for the behaviour of a group, based upon views held by that group.

&gt; We have much better ways to explain the 'complementarity' of female and male bodies and it doesn't say anything about who should be allowed to marry who.

Yet, the bible does, and that is what religious people follow to make their definition of marriage. Therefore, again, legal and religious marriage is separate. This also goes to your saying that marriage is a human-social construct - no, for some it is a human-social-religious construct.

&gt; In most societies the rules about who can marry whom typically come about from what works at the time, 

I really think you're taking your atheism and applying it retroactively, erasing all sign of religion throughout history and explaining it all in terms of base instincts.

Like it or not, humans do not solely base their actions on their base instincts, and while they may certainly (and are likely to) have been to do with how society functioned until organised religion came along, once it was there there was doctrine which explicitly stated how one should behave. Mass hysteria and mob mentality enforced that to a large degree.

&gt; Gay couples who want to marry could also argue that they are complementary to each other and god made them so. And they too might want to raise children.

They can certainly argue that. But they won't get anywhere with the religious types, and as fucked up as our politically correct culture is nowadays there's still no way you can force them to.

&gt; Actually I don't know if it's right to say that most religious people find homosexuality to be wrong,

I think it's right, but I don't have any quantitative evidence so I'll leave it.

The problem with that is that you're claiming to have a better understanding of her religion than she does. That only works if you're a fundamentalist who firmly believes that your version is the only one that's right. 

If you're an athiest who thinks that all religions are made up but still want to allow people to do the things they feel instructed to do, you've got to allow for each person's version of their religion - all the way to the jedi who wants to wear a Leia costume (which just highlights how rediculous it all is)

...around half the NHS budget already goes to private companies.

Even the majority of local GPs are private organisations who ""franchise"" their services to the NHS as they refused to join in the nationalisation when the NHS was created.

What's left? The buildings and the hospital staff wages. That's it. That's all there is of the NHS that is ""state owned"".

So, if by privatise, you mean sell of what's left, then that is just the buildings and the staff - and the last government used PFI to effectively sell off most of the new buildings anyway.

So the idea that there is some grand scheme, or hidden plot to privatise the rest of NHS is tin-foil hat conspiracy theories - the NHS is already largely a private organisation.

We have to remember that if the NHS is so wonderful - as many claim - then it is because most of what it does is being provided by private companies.

Either the people claiming there is a plot to privatise the NHS are ignorant of how it is already working, and need to research their facts - or they do know what goes on, and are playing cheap politics with the healthcare system.

Groups exist that only allow men in. Groups exist that only allow women in. Groups exist that only allow heterosexuals in, and it is not up to the law to change that.

Not being allowed as part of a social group is not discrimination, in the moral sense, in my view.

what about the PCTs and SHAs? there is a whole organisational 'state-owned' level of the NHS that is effectively being outsourced.

the foundation trust hospitals become private companies in all but name - allowed to set wages, invest in the stock market AND go bankrupt. if they do bankrupt, private companies can take them over (or just close them down if it seems they'll never be profitable).

clinical commissioning groups (which, as you pointed out, already franchise their services to the nhs) become totally private, able to compete with each other and provide health care to other commissioning groups AND themselves. they are able to go bankrupt and be taken over by private companies.

payment by results is extended from elective surgery (hip replacements) right across the board - including hard to quantify areas like psychiatry. at present providers are not allowed to compete on price, only on 'quality'. this is not payment by SUCCESSFUL result (ie better outcome for the patient) just by result (completing the operation, whether a good outcome for the patient or not).

so providers, who have to make a profit, will choose to provide services which can be done cheaply and quickly - they are paid a set amount per procedure, so providers will need to work as cheaply as possible to try to make a profit or just break even.

expensive, time-consuming operations will be harder and harder to find because they are not cost-effective for providers to offer.

Currently we generate about 40% of our electricity from coal, 40% from natural gas and 20% from nuclear (small fractions of wind, hydro and euro-interconnectors thrown in for good measure). These proposals are only dealing with electricity demand, and mostly just replacing the old plants shut by the large combustion directive.

Electricity is only a part of our energy consumption. Heating our homes, offices, hospitals and everything else is done by natural gas. Gas delivers simply enormous amounts of power. Ours is running out and we're having to buy it on global markets via LNG, competing with Asia and other developed economies. Start shifting even a small proportion of our heating from gas to electric and the grid is in trouble, especially with the energy efficiency of a typical UK house.

Then there's oil. Same thing applies, falling domestic supplies, increasing demand. It's not just as simple as switching to electric cars. Again the grid won't cope. 

We need to throw everything at this, and nothing is being done. Meanwhile the British public hate everything -

Clothes shops, groceries and toiletries are about the only things I still buy in person, and even though on-line shopping is starting to encroach on this space. So yeah, I would love to see city/town centers being more about parks, restaurants. galleries etc. Even housing, if you look at many of the town centers there were clearly apartments above many older stores, but now they are just stock rooms or dumping grounds. Or even worse, just boarded up. Who will pay for it is a good question, but I suspect we'll see a shift away from centralized taxes towards a system of local income taxes as they have in places like Sweden. 

&gt; I suppose this fits into a wider narrative. As everything becomes more streamlined, efficient and robotic, what the hell do the people do, what are the jobs for the future when we don't need the labour?

There will still be jobs, just not as many of them and they will be more skilled than the bulk of jobs are today. So people will need to get a far better education than they have now. The only problem I can see is that humanity has essentially selectively bred large amounts of the population for manual labor rather than anything intellectual. Given that manual labor will largely become irrelevant inside a century or so, I'm not sure how we're going to adapt. There will probably be a need for less people (developed economies produce less children), and a greater amount of pressure to expand off-world. 

Right now, we're at the start of a change in society where automation is starting to creep in, but we're not anywhere near the end of it yet.

&gt;If they can't win alone, we have to hope that some Lib Dem ministers break rank and oppose it because they genuinely oppose it.

&gt;As for 66%, that is information that was provided in January this year, before the other Royal Colleges met with Cameron to discuss the plans. As far as I know, some of them now oppose these reforms due to the impact they will have on the quality of care of the patients. 66% was perhaps right at the start of the year.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;There was a video I watched recently which suggested that if the 10,000 or so nuclear reactors which would be required globally to replace existing fuel sources were built and operational, we would exhaust known uranium reserves in about 30 years.

They're talking about traditional PWR reactors using U^235, and being fairly pessimistic about U^235 supplies.

&gt;Are the U238 compatible reactors feasible, viable, economic without massive subsidy etc., and likewise the extraction of this isotope?

Feasible, viable yes. They were created in the 50's, competed with U^235 reactor models for a while, but the latter was chosen because it was more useful for weapons research, and U^235 is simpler in the short term.

Economic without subsidy, good question. Hard to be sure, but certainly thorium reactors (one of the two main types of breeder reactor) appear to be considerably cheaper than PWR reactors for the reason that fuel costs are lower and waste is less of a problem.

Extraction is fairly simple. There is an awful lot of Uranium out there, it's just the stuff we currently use composes less than 1% of the total quantity. U^238 composes about 99%. As for Thorium, there's about as much of it out there as there is lead.

&gt;Are the reports that nuclear isn't a viable alternative to current energy sources valid in any way

It depends what you mean. There are problems, yes, but then one must look at matters such as this from a realist perspective.

Renewable energy isn't going to power the world for quite some time. Sure, you can look at Denmark or Portugal, but these are rare examples not indicative of how the rest of the world is.

Essentially, oil is running out. Oil provides baseload power. Renewables can not compete for baseload power generation yet, only for the supplementary portion of energy generation. There are two real options for the replacement of oil, coal or nuclear power. Either can be viable if picked as a power source for major countries. I'm into the latter more than the former.

Regarding waste, this is a pressing question, however most western countries are now somewhere into the process of creating extreme long term storage for the waste. The Finns are near enough finished creating an underground repository which should last roughly 100k years.",0,1331559342,null,0,false,0,c4065q5,t3_qsrgc,t1_c4065q5,t1_c405wzp,null,1428510647,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Oh really? Has anyone told the 100,000 former residents of Fukushima yet? I'm sure they would be delighted to hear they don't have to wait decades to return home, after all!

Okay, that was a bit sarcastic, but I hope you can see my point. I accept that nuclear power is probably the only realistic way of meeting our future energy needs in the short term, but trying to paint it up as an environmentally friendly option is just absurd. Accidents can and will always happen and there is always a potential for something unforeseen to occur. It only needs one disaster at one plant and the lives of hundreds of thousands of people – both present and future – may be ruined. To say nothing of the effect that such a disaster would have on our economy.

Sure, if all of the proper safety measures^\* are undertaken and strictly adhered to, and if enough planning is made to ensure set safety procedures are followed in the event of an accident or external disaster, there is *less* chance of a major incident occurring, but such measures usually rely on a large number of people rigorously and religiously staying vigilant. Can we trust that safety measures and disaster aversion practises at our nuclear facilities would be enforced any better than they were at the Fukushima plant – where their woeful unreadiness for their disaster was in part responsible for the ultimate meltdown? 

&amp;#160;^\* *By ""all"" I mean they would need to plan for* ***any*** *eventuality, however remote, and I'm not so sure they would do that.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'll try to shed some light on this if I can. First of all the claim with regards to 30 years worth of fuel is correct, but the key word there is ""known"" reserves. As of right now, we get our uranium from only the most abundant mines. Not a lot has been done in terms of exploratory mining because there has been no need to do so. We are just ""scratching the surface"" as it were...

As for U238 compatible reactors, this is a bit more problematic. Like all new technologies it needs investment, but the ideas are there. In fact the very first nuclear reactors used U238 (Magnox in the UK, UNGG in France - both used to produce plutonium at the time but that's another story).

As for mining the fuel, U235 and 238 aren't separated on site. You simply mine uranium, which in its natural state is about 0.7% 235 and 99.3% 238, with trace amounts of other isotopes thrown in. Only after some processing is it ""enriched"" to reach between 3 and 5% U235, the rest is still U238. This is the composition of the fuel we currently use in our reactors (disregarding mixed oxide fuel - again, another story).
If we were to build reactors that used U238 exclusively, then the whole enrichment process is unnecessary. And as stated above, the quantities of ""diluted"" U238 are almost limitless.

true,Kim147,uk,British Sandgroper,"It sounds like the government just have not thought this through properly . 

I have a lot of experience with the Australian system as a patient \ customer . There the GP's almost all operate privately and there is full competition and the system works well . The way that they do it is that GP's are paid on a per procedure basis . This is the key . As such they get a fixed rate for each bit of work that they do . If they don't work they don't get paid . They don't have a 'budget' as such to administer . If a patient needs a surgical operation he first contacts his GP who then provides the contacts through to the various surgeons who can do the operation . They in turn operate out of specific hospitals . The patient has full choice as to which surgeon he wants to use and alternatively which hospital he wants to use . And he can change his GP very easily and he can walk into any GP surgery . As such there is full competition and minimal bureaucracy . The government just makes sure it operates properly .

Medicare - the government insurance scheme - covers everyone on low incomes . Private insurers cover the rest .

Hospitals are varied - there are hospitals owned by doctors collectives , by churches and fraternal organisations , by private companies and by state governments and local councils .

There are many private companies supplying services - such as pathology , radiography etc. . Ambulances are supplied by St. John's Ambulance service .

The system works very well .

This NHS reboot ? - seems to be very badly thought out , something that this government seems to be doing a lot of .

PS : In the Australian system out of hours surgeries are usual - evenings and weekends . 

The GPs usually have a speciality , often it is a surgical speciality . They alternate between the practice and the hospital . This , apart from anything else , provides a feed in and it keeps them interested - something more than just general practice . 

The public private system is fully integrated - there is no seam - the government department of health controls all in a hands off manner .

Waiting times are very short . It is quite possible to walk into a surgery and be seen after a short wait . It is also possible to book surgery for a couple of days hence .

Mostly seen in /b/, this meme involves the poster to write Candlejack’s name somewhere in the post and be cut off mid sentence, implying that Candlejack captured him.

**Usage** Example:

* “Who is Candlejack anywa-”

To start with the store's isles are just slightly to small for her to manoeuvre without knocking into displays and people, so the staff stand by tutting as she tries to get to the counter without running people down.  When she finally get to the counter it's about a foot too tall for her to hand up the games.  The staff member serving doesn't offer to help so the wife hands the games to my daughter to pass over.  The dumbass serving then says that they can't serve my wife since my daughter is to young for an M-Rated game.  After a bit of a heated exchange during which the wife is - in her words - spoken to like a 5 year old she's asked to leave the store with my daughter in tears.   The Grimsby store on the other hand is the complete opposite, polite staff, they've moved displays out of the way for her, and will offer to go look for stuff for her if it's above her reach.

True with the exception of hydroelectricity. You can basically open the gates on a dam and spin up the turbines instantly. This means you can have a clever little system whereby when the demand on the grid is low, the extra power from nuclear plants goes to pumping water to the top of a dam, then, if there's a sudden surge in demand, you can rely on all the water stored at the top of the dam to provide you with some extra power. As you said, nuclear reactors don't have this kind of flexibility, it takes time for them to change their power output.

My problem is this.  I've been watching the good Doctor since I was a wee boy living in England in the 80's.  he's essentially been a constant part of my life.  Watching Torchwood and Sarah Jane at first was quite difficult for this one reason and only reason: Where was the Doctor? now hear me out.  It took awhile to get through these series because whenever something horrible would happen or things seemed at a loss all I could think was ""ok the Doctor is going to show up and fix everything with ease because these problems to him are fun and easy."" but he never showed.  It's like that Torchwood episode with the cyber woman.  it was one cyberwoman against the entire Torchwood team and they were all panicing and freaking out like they had just found a Dalek or something.  If the Doctor had shown up naturally he would have thought this was cool and interesting and probably would have taken care of the problem in the first 10min, hopped back in the TARDIS and gone off on some other adventure.  Essentially what i'm saying is the problems/challenges on both Torchwood and Sarah Jane seem extremely simple in comparison to what the Doctor has to go through and that was a real challenge for me to accept.  You know he's around in the same universe and what have you.  you know the TARDIS could just drop him off at Torchwood or infront of Sarah Janes house and things would be solved quickly, but it'll never happen.

Nuclear is only cheap if you stick your fingers in your ears about what to do with the waste once you've made it.

Wrapping it up in sand and burying it in a massive hole or dropping into the ocean and writing a intergalactic ""DO NOT FUCKING OPEN THIS!"" message which generations in 10,000 years will understand is hardly a solution.

It's also hardly cost effective. It's also not renewable, because like Oil, it relies on Uranium, which also **will** peak, no matter how you try to look at it. Sure it will take a long time, but we will get there.

Like others have said, the decomissioning costs of Nuclear are the canary in the coalmine, and the Nuclear Industry are trying to ensure no one considers this cost.

I think he has the potential to be 3rd in the pecking order on the wings 2nd in the pecking order for CAM. If the team doesn't see it that way then he should do a 6 month loan again...although I'm personally ready to see him in blue. 

He's fairly versatile and if he keeps this up I think he's good enough to get around 10-12 starts &amp; 7-8 subs...possibly more. He will likely start in a rotation on the wings and as cover for Mata and as a sub. He should definitely start all carling cup games, easy FA cup games, and any easy CL games (fingers crossed)...so that's about 5-6 starts right there. I think he would be a big asset to the team around Christmas time when the fixtures are piling up and if he can prove himself then we will see more of him in the second half of the year. Also the ACoN happens again next year so in the event that we keep Kalou that will also open some space.

If you look at the manchesters this years, united last year, and at our squad a few years ago I think it is pretty apparent that you can't win the title with 11 players.

Dear Edward Davey,

My name is --- , I am writing to you to get your position on Nuclear energy and I also ask for you to check out this video on TED talks : http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/kirk_sorensen_thorium_an_alternative_nuclear_fuel.html 

It explains the benefits to use of Thorium, a safe form of nuclear energy, infact the US had a working thorium reactor right up until 1973 when the Nixon administration cancelled it.
The reason: because it's difficult to build nuclear bombs using thorium.

I am writing to you now because it has come to my attention that it is building up momentum in the UK, and I think that we can be worldwide pioneers in this field. There was recently a new Parliamentary group formed to discuss the use of Thorium, you can find a link here: http://energyfromthorium.com/2012/03/01/appg-thorium/

I hope I have made it easy for you to educate yourself on the use of Thorium and its potential.

Most other teams and scouts take a bit longer to see how you manage the group and are less prepared than later years.  The list goes on.

Here in the states, in almost all sports, there are many managers who have great first seasons--but it doesn't always translate into long term success.

There are also managers who completely blow up a team to take in a new direction, or rebuild a team in disarray.  In these situations, there is almost never an immediate turn around.

Doctor will save the day. Period. Sure someone usually dies but it's rarely someone that matters. In Torchwood, you feel like the characters actions have real consequences. Their isn't some brittish superman there to come save the day. The only way out for them is luck and hard work.

It encourages urban sprawl, as these houses are the kind of shit stud-walled McMansions you see on motorway spurs. This pushes the centre of gravity of the population further away from town centres, and further into car reliance and all the other pitfalls of suburban life.

Next you have the older people who need to move into a larger house. If there are no young families seeking to buy their houses, they can't move on. All the first time buyer's purchasing power will be used on new builds. The **only** people this scheme helps are property developers. Cronyism on top!

true,Noodlehands,null,null,"I have a few sympathies with aspects of the Libertarian movement, but to suggest that there are no left/right aspects to any of it is nonsense. This article sums it up 

http://thenewinstrument.com/?p=174

&gt;I pointed out in the aforementioned essay that if the libertarians ever truly seized power the results would probably be – as so often is the case with extremists who preach liberty – totalitarianism. But in all likelihood the libertarians will never get hold of true power – for unlike their Marxist-Leninist brethren, they are a political cult without a broad base of support; they have no proletariat and no peasantry!...

&gt;We could simply chalk this up as a strawman and have done with it. But I believe it highlights something specific about the libertarian mind. The libertarian is generally not interested in arguing about empirical facts or the empirical validity of a theory, just as Rothbard is not interested in examining the possible similarities between Westerners and primitive tribes people and their respective economic systems. Instead, they are only comfortable when making broad-sweeping moral or metaphysical arguments – and so, a typical rhetorical tactic is to assign a moral or metaphysical point-of-view to the opponent and then take this apart. Meanwhile the opponent sits there in a complete daze, trying to get a point in sideways about the structure of the banking system or something so banal while being accused of being a ‘primitivist’, a ‘communist’ or some other such nonsense.

&gt;This is the ground, the ground of generalisations and stereotypes that the libertarian inhabits. The world is divided up into ‘good guys’ and ‘bad guys’ with clearly delineated metaphysical positions that can be attacked or approved of. Meanwhile, those of us who eschew such pat generalisations try to argue with facts and are baffled when the libertarians begin once more to talk about their metaphysics.

The internet is a fantastic resource, but for those less used to navigating its tubes, it can be daunting or confusing.

A large part of the customers I see in GAME are families, parents or other gift buyers, and one of my favourite parts of my job is to help them find what they're after, and understand what they've bought.

You might roll your eyes and the technophobes, thinking them a relatively small part of the games industry, but Wii's have easily outsold PS3s and 360s over this console cycle, and non-gamer families are a huge part of that.

The other set of customers I would say we have are the ones looking for a sense of community, as much as anything else. A lot of gamers out there simply don't have gamer friends, or do, but don't feel like they have anywhere to discuss games or learn about new ones.

Another part of our customer service, especially for Gamestations, is to cater for them. To give them a place to go, chat, and pick up games they might not have thought of buying.

This, I think, is why you see more people here and in the (many) comments pages I've seen lately about us, mourning Gamestation while scorning GAME.

While it's obviously not been enough of a market over the last year, I think there is a vast tendency to overlook the other types of customers, assuming that GAME is pointless because it doesn't cater to ""you"".

Wages are slightly better in Canada, but things cost slightly more (though rent is more expensive). The job market is also slightly better in Canada, but not orders of magnitude better.

People in Britain tend to seem on average slightly more educated than the average Canadian or American, with a broader base of knowledge.  That said the extremes are greater in Britain, some people are just idiots full stop with a greater variation in the individual.

Britain has superior health services to Canada, and I can say that having used at least 3 different provincial services. Other social services I cannot comment on the difference.

My parents actually moved to Canada from northern England in the late 70s to avoid the decline and though I can't say it hasn't 'declined'(having not been born here) I can certainly say I haven't the foggiest why people complain so much- I rationalise it as a fundamental nostalgia for empire.

Hello, I’m Alex Vince and I’m running for VP Activities! (This is a co-position to education, so you can vote for both me and Enzo)

I’m a History &amp; Politics student who has dedicated the past year to working with societies, while taking part in Media and RAG.

My broad experience of working in all areas of student activities makes me the best candidate to understand and facilitate the needs of students within activities.

My current responsibilities include:

• Leadership - The current Societies Executive Chairman

• Societies - Secretary for Amnesty International Society &amp; treasurer for politics &amp; debating society and a normal member of many others.

• Media - I have written for our student newspaper, the Galleon, and have my own Radio show on Monday mornings.

• Rag - I’ve also taken part in fundraising for RAG.

Activities are currently too confined to the Union! As your VP, I wish to bring them out of that building and into the university community, and hope to be able to engage a far wider number of students with these ideas!

All Activities -

First Step pack – Information about all activities supplied to freshers when they first come to Portsmouth
Making committee training available at the start of every semester

Personally visiting every international student group and running a campaign to make it easier for international students to get involved in all activities


Societies –

Societies On Campus – Getting a pair of societies setting up stalls in the main university areas every week to speak directly to students who don’t visit the union!

Giving a support pack with all key union information handed to every society

Making academic societies free with automatic membership and helping them support the course rep system

Getting more musical societies to play in the waterhole

Giving every society president a one on one session at the start of the year to help prepare them

Securing additional storage space within the Union


Media –

Granting Media greater editorial independence

Securing more resources for media equipment

Encouraging co-operation with media, societies and sports to get the best of the Union reported straight to students

Working towards FM Radio status for Pure FM

Co-operating with media courses


RAG –

Ensuring every RAG representative holds at least one event per semester

Rewarding the greatest fundraisers with free places on one of the Unions European trips

As you can see, its quite a packed line up! I hope there's something in there of interest to everyone, and I haven't even started talking about how I'll support our political societies working together in their ""Political Union"" project, or how I wish to review the Societies Executive to make it more relevant to students in societies, or how I wish to open up the ASDAN trial in order to allow students who spend their time and energy in activities to become credited, or how I wish to work with the VP for community and welfare to ensure that our welfare societies are properly trained and equipped to support the students under their care. It'd be a very ambitious first year in office, but I'm willing to go the extra mile to make it all work!

So Vote Alex, a New Dawn for Activities!

• BitTorrent is technically illegal

• We already pay for BBC content and the iPlayer

• Nothing is faster than live

• I already download torrents of programs which, in the old Soviet era, I would have recorded to VHS for keeps

As for the point on DRM, I'm totally with you.  They can already block people from viewing iPlayer et al from outside the UK, via their IP address (even though it is trivial to bypass this, or use vipbox.tv).  

But what winds me up the most, which I didn't mention in the original post, was that the BBC gave assurances to the BBC Trust and members of parliament, who enquired on behalf of various consumer rights groups, when iPlayer was launched, that content would be available on all platforms.  This led to the dropping of Microsoft Windows Media Video (which would have excluded Linux and some Mac users) and the adoption of what the then director general called, ""an open standard"".  When iPlayer was eventually launched, hey presto they plumped for Adobe Flash — a closed standard, which is also deeply unreliable.

As if to add insult to injury, because the BBC wanted to cozy up to Apple, they agreed to also provide an MPEG4 stream of their iPlayer content, for iPhone (and later iPad) only.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"Fortunately we don't have a duopoly with the supermarkets here - nowhere near, in fact - and it wouldnt be allowed to happen any time soon either unless through a few decades of insane amounts of corruption. In some countries this is actually already the case and it can suck a lot at times. It's fairly dangerous when that is the case, even if they are competing, because there's no guarantee it will last, and people see all sorts of strange behaviors cropping up.

But look at us, we're spoiled for choice, I can think of 6 places off the top of my head that are in direct competition with each other where I can buy games online and offline after Game is gone - I don't think we're gonna be in trouble any time soon on that front! As I already said, Game was hardly driving the competition now, was it? Let's be honest...

And plus those people who do still buy at Game aren't going to suddenly stop buying games.. they are suddenly potential customers at multiple outlets, and those outlets will of course keep on competing now to get those ex-Game customers... I really don't think Game going under is a huge problem, just one less bully on the high street IMO. It's hardly like there's less competition without Game around, if anything there could be more, seeing as they weren't competing anyway and now there are more people to shop at places that *are* competing.

All the little guys who have been working their asses off running their independent and etc. stores will see increases in sales, they'll employ more staff, some jobs will go to packing games into boxes in an Amazon warehouse, working for Steam support, etc. The venue people buy games is shifting, but those 10,000 jobs won't *all* be lost for good. Of course with this world becoming slowly more digital, physical jobs in any given position will keep dropping as they've been doing for decades.

With with regards to your point regarding rent - yes, it's true, rent is a lot in these prime locations, but there are thousands of types of shops that can't operate in places like that. So just add game retailers to the list, now. Can't expect everything to stay the same forever. If high streets become vacated, prices will drop, new tenants will move in, it's supply and demand, and clearly there is more demand for those spots than there is supply right now, which is why Game can no longer afford to operate them. The age of selling media on silly plastic discs is coming to an end, just like you don't see farriers in the middle of town to fix shoes onto horses any more either.

But still regardless of all this, and rent, and etc. They hardly had the best business practises. I'd rather have a choice between Tesco and Asda then Game and Gamestation any day. Game is the kind of company you do *not* want involved in a situation where there's only one or two outlets for your stuff!",0,1331587015,null,0,true,0,c40bb3c,t3_qrq6h,t1_c40bb3c,t1_c409u3r,null,1428513207,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I find it almost laughable that this GP is lecturing us against the private sector making a profit from healthcare.

The vast majority of GP surgeries work as a private companies contracted to the NHS, which in recent years have seen services provided drop (no out of hours care, no weekends etc) whilst GP salaries increased almost 33%. Ever wonder why there is a pharmacy in your surgery? A GP with an attached pharmacy earns something like £10k more a year than one without because of all the drug lobbying. I read an article from someone who had worked with GPs for 25 years, he said the first thing you will see when you go into a GPs office is for them to press CTRL+f5 or something on their computer, which brings up the drugs they can prescribe you which make them the most money - I dont know if this is true or not but I am going to keep an eye out for it next time I go. With the average GP now earning over £100k a year, which by far the highest in Europe what we have seen in recent years is local practices run for profit to try and maximise the salaries of the GPs and not to try and raise money to provide extra services. He goes on about how private companies will drop 'difficult treatments', which is exactly what GP surgeries have done, try and get a GP out of hours or to do a home visit and you will be told politely to stuff off and phone NHS 24 or book an appointment which you will have to wait a week for and will last about 30 seconds.

There is no argument against NHS reform of some kind, we have an aging population and excessive problems with debt. Whether or not the way the current government wants to go about it or not is the best way I don't know - but I do think that we need to stop treating the NHS as some kind of sacred cow that is above any kind of reform, because clearly it is needed. 


TL DR: This GP crying about private companies making money off the NHS is stupid since GPs operate as private companies that have seen them making a fortune over the last 5-7 years whilst reducing services. If anything you need to cap GP pay so more is allocated onto services or introduce more private companies to create some competition so GPs dont have a total monopoly, I sense this is why GPs are against the bill.",0,1331587194,null,0,true,0,c40bce1,t3_qsvaf,t1_c40bce1,t3_qsvaf,null,1428513229,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

It used to be that when a new game would come out Game would be able to get a stock of games sell what they can and **then** pay the distributor based on how many units they opened and stocked. What they didn't sell would simply be shipped back to the distributor for them to give to either online warehouses or any other stores that needed them. 

Now distributors are asking for an upfront payment of stock, this is why copies of mass effect 3 were not going to be distributed at one point because head office couldn't negotiate a deal with EA over this and also why Saints Row 3 practically sold out across its stores.

Also another nail in the Game coffin has been the developers war on the second hand game market. Without opening a huge can of worms on that, Game made a lot of money through that (anyone who has worked in Game, I being one of them, will tell you their is a huge pressure to move pre-owned stock). Through online passes, developers have pretty much killed the value of pre-owned games.

But oh christ is Flash a pile of bollocks. It's started slowing down horribly on my machine if I have a Flash movie in one window and a flash advert running in the other, bringing Chrome grinding to a halt.

IPlayer for me is the best of them (although it's not perfect). I want to rip my own genitals off with the annoyance of YouTube and 4oD Flash players. Pausing for more than a few minutes? Crash. In and out of fullscreen a few times? Crash. Press pause while buffering? Crash. Press pause, then switch out of fullscreen? Crash.

If flash player crashes and you need to reload the page you have to watch the same stupid advert again. And the retarded advert algorithms make it impossible to flick through a number of programmes to find the one you want. You have to watch the same stupid advert a dozen times in quick succession. I don't mind seeing adverts for commercial TV. I really don't, they pay for programmes. But please don't batter me over the head with them.

And for fucks sake normalise the volume across all of your programmes and adverts. If an advert is a reasonable volume I'll let it run through without touching it. If it's some loud obnoxious bollocks I *will* mute it. (But be careful not to click the advert. That's another crash.) IPlayer might not have adverts, but they don't seem very good at keeping a constant volume across their programmes.

Programmes sometimes not properly fullscreen, but taking up only 2/3 of the available area? Check. Programmes sometimes arbitrarily switching to even-worse-than-usual bandwidth? Check. Grindingly slow website overloaded with Christ-knows-what shitty Javascript (4oD)? Check.

Christ knows why I don't pirate the fucking programmes. Here's an idea: Channel 4, instead of arsefucking about with Flash and YouTube, put your programmes up on bittorrent *with embedded adverts*. 99% of punters won't care about editing the adverts out.

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

I live in an area which is a labour stronghold and even the labour die-hards think that the Labour Shadow Cabinet is a complete and utter joke right now.

During that last general election David Miliband came to my local college which I was on placement at and he was absolutely electric. He had everyone, even the supporters of opposing parties in the palm of his hand for those 30 minutes that he was there and to see that charisma in contrast to Brown at the time was night and day.

Apparently Ed Miliband was chosen because he could unite the Labour party where as David was not as fond on the unions but I always thought David was the better choice. There is always a risk that he is just Tony Blair 2.0 but Ed does not have the gravitas to stand toe to toe with David Cameron right now who is much better equipped to be a public figurehead. Ed Miliband feels like he is out of his depth and would be much more suited to something like minister of education or transport minister and not the leader of the opposition.

Would have been interesting to see what the landscape of UK politics would look like had David Miliband challenged Gordon Brown to a leadership challenge right before the election rather than bottling it and now fading into obscurity.",0,1331590638,null,0,false,0,c40c018,t3_qtbed,t1_c40c018,t3_qtbed,null,1428513571,-8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-8

Last year we got PV cells on our roof. 10 of them making a total of 2.4kW when it's bright out (with the inverters, meters, yada yada), for ~£9k, but we were given about £2k up front as a grant to do so, and we get paid ~43.3p/kWh (we signed up for a fixed rate as it makes financial sense, the way it al works out we'll be paid back with a tidyish profit before the cells reach 'end of life' which is in 2021 - a handy little thing is that the meter measures every kWh the cells output, and we get paid for that, even if that power does not go out onto the national grid! So when the house is running solely from the cells while they're producing at full power it's earning about £1.40 an hour)... a few months ago the rate for energy produced was taken down to about 15p per kWh... no-one can afford to put cells up for that! It makes no financial sense any more.

The cells are up on our house because it made financial sense, but for someone to have cells installed now would be due to them being nuts and a bit of a hippy really.

At the very least, Liverpool could very easily argue that they need to recoup the cost spent on him, so minimally 22-25mil GBP is expected. 

If he really wants to leave and there isn't a bidding war, we might only get 30mil GBP for him. If there are lots of interested parties and he finishes the season on a high, we might get up to 40mil GBP. It's hard to see him being worth any more than that, but this will be dependent on how many striking options are available. Keep in mind that last summer, Falcao moved to Atletico for 38mil GBP.

Effective regulation requires close vetting by the public but it seems many of us are complacent about potential risks of new reactors - it's all new and 21st century so it must be fine, we don't get earthquakes here, let's not worry about it. With the lengthy timescales of nuclear reactors and nuclear waste I'm not convinced we can always keep the industry under the close scrutiny it needs.

They'll probably do it at the user end set-top-box, similar to the conditional access modules which are hard wired to the circuit board in branded Sky Digital receivers, but optional on platform agnostic third party satellite decoders.  The signal essentially goes out as plaintext, but can only be decoded by a valid chip at the user end — analogous to public key encryption.

What's causing all the problems for ITVPlayer and 4OD, is the advertisers and content owners are insisting on locking the content down so tightly, it's using massive amounts of CPU cycles of the end user's PC or Mac, meaning two and three year old general purpose computers are being made to do all the heavy lifting normally expected of a dedicated hardware MPEG decoder.  Meanwhile, those kind souls who own hardware MPEG decoders are plucking perfect digital clones of the content literally right out of thin air and posting it on Kick Ass Torrents.

The worry now is while Torrents have no adverts or image compression artefacts, and are a billion million times better than the ""legitimate"" versions, as of the end of this year all analogue signals are being turned off, so the ITV companies and the UK TV consortium (comprising Five and BBC Worldwide) can begin to roll out a second generation, non-backwards compatible Freeview Plus and a new DAB Radio platform also incompatible with the existing system.

The fact remains that whenever there's news of a plane crash it's almost always headlined that there were no survivors. Fatal RTAs are reported far more frequently, but there are almost always *some* survivors as well; and of course the vast majority of RTAs don't involve any fatalities at all. 

Moreover, the way most people evaluate danger is lot more sophisticated than simply examining statistics. There are a number of other things – such as fear of heights, fear of drowning, fear of terrorism etc. – that factor into the equation. Flying also involves putting one's faith in a complete stranger [the pilot] to do a quite difficult job wherein a single mistake – especially at critical points like take-off and landing – can be catastrophic.

true,TriFerret,null,null,"The thing I fail to understand or even slightly grasp is how some of the players making up our bench are being overlooked. Bellamy is fair enough of course, he has a history of trouble with his knee and overplaying him would be a desperately unwise move. However, I want to look at 3 players particularly. Dirk Kuyt, Maxi Rodriguez and Jonjo Shelvey.

Andy Carroll is being played regularly, albeit occasionally as a sub, but still regularly. Kuyt is lucky to play two games in a row and sometimes only features for half a game in a given month. While Kuyt certainly has his faults (lack of finesse for one), he is certainly a stronger choice than Andy Carroll... Dirk Kuyt is a man who plays for the World Cup runners up, and Carroll can barely break in to the mighty English national side. Kuyt looks aggressive on the pitch, he wants the goals, he's hungry for them and, even though he sometimes lacks the quality to finish some of the more challenging chances, he has still scored some damn important goals. Andy Carrolls best two strikes that I saw were against Championship sides or worse. He never looks hungry for the goal and is all too willing to give up a promising attack in favour of shifting the responsibility to somebody else. His jumps are lazy, his shots are half arsed and his general play is sloppy. When he misses he walks away mostly emotionless whereas Kuyt gets in a serious mood with himself. Kuyt is the OBVIOUS choice ahead of Carroll.

Charlie Adam is at the age now where he has effectively reached the peak of his game. I don't see him getting a great deal better than he is now. Which is worrying, mainly because he's distinctly average now. His set pieces are weak, and why he and Gerrard even have to DISCUSS who will take it is completely beyond me. His defensive work is sloppy, and half the tackles he goes in for quickly become free kicks and/or yellow cards. He's a ""long ball specialist"" yet he seems to give away possession pretty much all the time. Everything he is packaged to be, is what Gerrard already is. His accuracy and composure in front of goal is absolutely woeful, and I'm sure when we next go to the moon we'll get calls from Adam asking for his balls back. On the bench, we have Jonjo Shelvey. 19 years old and already just as good/possibly better than Adam. He is only going to get better for the next few years if he is given time on the field to gain experience. He has a sort of youthful cockiness about him on the field that keeps him believing and focused on his ability. I've seen him threaten the goal and link up well with our strikers a good amount in the very short time I've seen him play. If he was given more time to gain experience he could easily be our next star midfielder as Gerrard's career comes to an end. We should make valuable use of the time that Shelvey will have to play with Steven and learn from him in order to prepare him for possibly taking up his position in the team ultimately.

Finally, Jordan Henderson and Stewart Downing have both failed to deliver a great deal this season, although Downing's support work and effort have been brilliant at time so I believe he has just been unlucky. Henderson however occasionally shows two minute flairs of being a fantastic player... and then becomes invisible again. That inconsistency is not good enough for Liverpool Football Club. Bolton or Wolves would benefit greatly from his presence but if WE rely on him, then we are settling for no more or less than those teams would. On the bench and totally able to play on the wings when Bellamy and Downing can't be on together is Maxi Rodriguez. It has been mentioned before that he ""poaches"" goals, but at the end of the day, a goal is a goal, and we have nobody else on our side that seem to be poaching the easy chances. He is skillful on the ball, and his work rate and reading of the game is marvelous. My favourite goal of the season was the one where Maxi, Bellamy and Suarez set up some magnificent passing in a line and tore the defence apart before Maxi saw the opening they were all waiting for and slotted it home. The man is an Argentina interanational! He has been deemed good enough to support Lionel Messi, but apparently Jordan Henderson (who was recently leapfrogged to a place in the senior England Squad by the 3 years younger Oxlaid Chambarlain) is the first choice ahead of him? It perplexes me.

There are of course other potentials on our bench, but those three confuse me the most. They are all top class players, but are kept on the touchlines by distinctly average choices. Is it Kenny being stubborn? Is he thinking, ""I bought them so I'll play them ahead of the previous team""? Does he honestly think the players he fields are BETTER? Maxi's last game was a bit poor, but that can't have KEPT him out right? Henderson has been INVISIBLE for weeks now so how can he still be first choice?

The sad reality is that these players KNOW they are good and, possibly with the exception of Dirk, do not have a great deal of loyalty to LFC. Come the summer, if they aren't being played, they will be eager to move to a club where they will actually see the pitch and get to do what they love. A club where the manager recognises the potential and hones it. Any club would be grateful for a player like Maxi! In Shelvey's case, maybe he isn't ready for a start yet, but he needs more time than the last 10 minutes of FA cup games against Championship opposition to start to become the player he COULD be. On the other hand, we'd be lucky to get even half our money back from our signings, and some of them would probably end up playing the role that Michael Owen has found him self playing at United. I'm sure even Dirk Kuyt could be lured away with offers of a starting XI place. Kenny needs to wake up and realise that once those options leave LFC, they are gone, and then we are STUCK with the mediocre players he has bought in. It's time to give these players' talent the recognition and game time that it deserves!

(In a side note, two of these players scored hat tricks last season.

But actually, I think the main issue here is that we're using different definitions.

true,Antagony,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire Pudding,"Well it's true that I don't think examining the cold facts alone is the only way ir/rationality should be determined. To my mind it's perfectly rational to have a healthy respect, if not a fear, for things that can hurt you. Most instinctive fears fall into that category, so they shouldn't necessarily be dismissed as irrational just because they're not supported by the numbers in the context of a particular situation where one is exposed to them. I say again: Bungee jumping is relatively safe, but I defy anyone who's not an adrenalin junkie not to be scared shitless at the prospect of doing one.

I think it's also important to remember that we're only talking about whether the fear of flying is irrational when compared to travelling in ground vehicles, particularly cars, but I don't think that comparison is especially fair. Most of us have travelled around in ground vehicles pretty much our entire lives, and it's true that familiarity breeds contempt. Flying is generally a much rarer event, so the element of nervousness over doing something you're not as familiar with adds to all the other fears. I guess what I'm saying is: it's not our fear of flying that's irrational, so much as our *lack* of fear for travelling on roads. And consider this purely hypothetical thought experiment: if the statistics for flying deaths were identical to what they are now, but all of the other modes of transport were significantly safer, would you still consider fear of flying to be irrational? I think probably not.

Came here to see the reaction to this game. Was I surprised we got 5 added minutes? Yes. There was not much to slow the game down other than the Koscielny/Ba clash of heads, Tiote injury, and Gutierrez yellow.

I think overall we deserved the win. Other than our shit finishing we out played Newcastle, they only had 4 total shots with 2 on target (1 of the 2 being a shit shot), compared to our 23 with 8 on target (yeah bad finishing today I know). As well as 61% - 39% when it came to possession.

I dont hate Spurs fans at all. In fact I honestly prefer my close friends to be fans of teams other than mine (close rivals is the best) as it makes things much more interesting.

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"First,

&gt; I had always hoped to see him retire in Blue but I suppose offloading him for money before his contract runs out would be business savvy for the club. (not that Abramovich needs it or anything)

As his contract would expire in the summer, we would only make money by not having to pay his (hefty) wages. We wouldn't profit from his sale and personally I feel this is better, let him move to where he wants if we don't want to keep him. He's been a great servant for the club, so we owe him that. We did the same with Deco and Cudicini, nor did we block Alex's exit.

Second, I don't think anyone knows at this point what will happen. It will be a very turbulent off-season I would imagine, to say the least. I can't even begin to speculate.

That said, I would also like to see him retire as a Blue. He's a good player to have for the club (good role model, good player, I imagine a good mentor - Lukaku) so I have no problem with him hanging around.

On the other hand, he's getting old, doesn't have many years left, so I would understand us parting ways with him. And more so, him parting ways with us to go to China or somewhere else in a money driven move. The man is a notorious philanthropist, if anyone would do something especially good with the ridiculous amount of money footballers make, it would be Didier.

Whatever happens, we owe a lot of one of the greatest strikers in Chelsea history. Whichever way it plays out, he'll always be Blue.",0,1331607291,null,0,false,0,c40f0ad,t3_qtvl8,t1_c40f0ad,t3_qtvl8,null,1435732123,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

true,lordmvt,null,null,"personally, i don't think people are giving steve clarke enough credit.  he's a major reason in our defence being so good this season.

we need attacking options, that's obvious to anyone who watches us.

from the word go, everyone at the club kept saying that henderson and carroll are long term investments.  we didn't buy them for one season, we bought them to grow into amazing players.  henderson has been played on the wing mainly this season to get his tactics and toughness up.  it's the same we did with gerrard back in the day.  while there is never a guarantee that he will turn out to be even half the player gerrard is, any one who is harsh on him is way too fickle.

same can be said about carroll, he's got all the makings of a great player.  he just needs confidence, and a team that creates chances for him.  if downing started playing like he did at aston villa, wipping in crosses all day, carroll would get more chances, more goals, more assists, and defenders would be scared shitless of him.  obviously there is always a chance he will slowly fade away and be remembered as a player who was bought for too much too early (remember kevin davies?), but the only way he'll get better is if the fans are totally behind him.

in dalglish i trust.  we'll buy a right winger and another striker in the summer, possibly two if suarez leaves.  

a lucky win from a deflection is all that's needed to start getting the ball rolling.

I have to disagree here. Our best eleven doesnt play the entire season, and our squad lacks the depth and quality. We are a few seasons away from challenging for the title and to think otherwise is foolish. 

There are no quick fixes though. We simply cannot buy ourselves out of this situation. Shame our academy hasnt churned out good midfielders and forwards since Gerrard/Owen.

I don't think unions have a huge amount of power in the UK except the transport unions. I used to think they were effective but now seem them as greedy and one of the causes of significant rises in transport costs for the public - in London, anyway. They hold the city to ransom - recent example of a bonus just to make sure they turn up to work during the Olympics is a joke. 

EDIT: Having read some of the other comments, I believe unions should play a role in Britain, but in their current form they are too combative, and not collaborative enough. Unions are obsessed by pay and not staff development - unions should be playing a much larger role in the reintroduction of proper apprenticeships in the UK, but they do virtually nothing. They do not help the longterm prospects of the workforces they represent - it's all short-term, and focussed on the next pay rise.

Drogba


I think the direct running and defensive cover of Ramires would be useful, and he could help out Luiz when he goes forward. Iva is usually a rock but he got caught out by the running of Napoli and as we saw against Stoke, most of his crosses have gone awry recently. I think Luiz is capable of crossing better, has enough pace and dribbling ability, and his shooting may allow him to get a goal from the RB position

I'm also playing Sturridge on the LW instead of the RW. Mainly to accomodate Ramires but I think it would help if he could cross the ball first-time to Drogba, instead of having to pause his run and cut in

I want Torres to come good, we all do, but throwing him in to such a high-pressure game probably won't work. As much as Didier only plays when he can be arsed, he did it against Valencia and might use this game as a stage for his swan-song

2-0. Shut up shop, thank Jebus and move on to conquering 4th place. Easy

There are low-paid security staff everywhere.  I'm guessing low-paid because just about every single one was an immigrant, or born of immigrant parents.  This isn't an observation on anything other than the fact that immigrants are often the only people prepared to do low-paid work.  They're also apparently quite poorly trained; one was unscrewing pens to check for weapons, while ignoring 3-inch locking-bladed multitools.  On one day, we pulled up to the pavement in a minivan at the side of a temporary metal fence (the mobile types that link together).  They went berserk at us for doing this on a public road **over which they have no jurisdiction**.  One was extremely rude at one of my colleagues, who had the temerity to unlink part of the fence to avoid a 100 yard walk around it.  Shouting at him, issuing instructions. On a public road.  On the same road they have a crossing patrol manning a pelican crossing and were trying to prevent people walking across of their own volition.  I just ignored them, as did most people.

Your pass, a very easily copyable large piece of laminated cardboard that caught the wind and slapped your face (so naturally you want to keep it hidden), was checked everywhere.  Woe betide you if you ever lost it.  Oh and if you walk in with a bag, it gets x-rayed.  If you put that bag in a car which is also entering, it doesn't get x-rayed.  Lesson for terrorists = put bombs in your bag, in your car.

I think they are incredibly important. Employment Law in the UK is hugely heavily weighted towards the employer - and the employee has actually, very few rights. If Unions can get in there and try and redress that balance, then thats gotta be a good thing, right? Unions work on both a collective, and an individual basis. 1) The collective: This is where when you have lots of the staff in the union, the union can go and negociate with the employer for better things at work. Example: Last week an employer wanted to change the working hours of all the staff in their office. The union negotiated with the employer so they only changed the hours half the week. This enabled the employer to get the business done, but the staff didn't have to work late all week. Individually, they were not able to negotiate this change, but as a collective (a union), we were. 2) Individuals get help from the union when they are in trouble at work, I have lost count of the number of people's jobs I have saved by representing them at work when they had sickness, disciplinary, bullying claims etc. Often its not that they have done something so bad, but that the employer is wrongly applying the law (or procedure) and therefore acting unfairly. 

As for your last question - too little power! Margaret Thatcher decimated the unions in the 1980s. She took away a lot of their power. Here's one *small* example. When Unions run a ballot, we used to be able to hold workplace meetings for people to vote, or run ballots in our workplaces, with auditors etc. So we could get all the union members in a room to vote - democracy in action, right? Now, no. You have to run a formal ballot run by an outside organisation, which costs the union thousands and thousands of pounds, and which members forget to vote in. So our turnouts tend to be around 30% - which the government criticizes us for (""Hey, this union is going on strike, but only 30% of the members voted!"") When *they themselves* make it incredibly difficult for unions to run a ballot. Under the old system, you'd get 100% turnout. The government has shafted unions, no question, because they are afraid of the power that they might have - which translates as - they are afraid of the will of the people.

That's the problem with Maxi - he probably offers the least defensively out of any of our attacking players. In the FA Cup game against United, Enrique was absolutely slaughtered down that flank by Rafael and Valencia because Maxi offered nothing in front of him, and was lucky not to get sent off for a red card.

His movement and finishing are great, but that's basically what he is - a poacher, but one operating from the flanks. Unless you're heavily outclassing the opponent, or the rest of your team is quality, you can't carry a player like that who can't offer anything defensively. Also, given that our best MO this season has been on the counter-attack, you need your players to put in a defensive shift.

They also later burn Irish tricolours and an effigy of the Pope at the bonfires, while singing sectarian songs. 

I don't know about the fiestas in Spain, but in some sense the conflict in NI has deep roots going back to the Battle of the Boyne and further. The battle was particularly significant as it allowed for the continuation of the Protestant supremacy in Ireland, the destruction of the Catholic middle-class and the disenfranchisement of the Catholic majority. It could perhaps even be said that William's victory is to some extent why Ireland is separated into 2 states today. So it is an old battle but there are still open wounds from it today and it shaped the situtation today. 

So I don't really think its a case of Catholics being desperate to take offence, it is a case of triumphalism on the part of the Orange Order. This is an organization remember, who are so anti-Catholic that they believe that St Patrick wasn't a Catholic (depite living 1000 years before the reformation). They also ban members who marry Catholics or attend any kind of Catholic mass for any event. They banned 2 Unionist politicians last year for attending the funeral of a murdered Catholic policeman.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"I worked at a London hospital in IT for ten years, and it pretty much clouded my view of unions generally.

The NHS union was/ is one of the biggest in the country - and yet year after year, when the government would state that we were going to get a 2% inflation rise (when the IR was around 8%), the union would roll over. It got so bad that one year, we were told that we'd get a 1% rise now, and another 1% six months later - again, as always, the union did nothing.

On top of that, we had people working in the IT department who knew almost nothing about their jobs, but weren't given the shove during the many purges-for-efficiency - because they were union reps. This meant that I had a union rep shoved onto me as a manager (after installing 700 desktops on my own), who didn't know you could drag icons from one window to another, worked 2.5 days a week and still got paid more than I did for doing 5, despite contributing precisely zero. There were others in a similar position, who would either sit at their desk and chat to whoever was nearby or sit in the smoking room and do the same - another one used to fall asleep at his desk, mouse in hand (because he wore glasses, at a glance it appeared he was doing something). As a result, I always wondered how bad things must be across the rest of the hospital/s if we had such deadwood that could seemingly survive anything. 

It didn't help seeing the figures for subs compared to the figures for union rep salaries.

As a result, I never paid any union subs - and people would look at me *shocked*, when I'd tell them this. More than once, I'd hear; ""But...but...what about if your job is threatened?""

""Well, I guess I'll have to get paid twice as much somewhere else for doing less work"" - which is precisely what happened.",0,1331637612,null,0,false,0,c40ilq0,t3_qtm8c,t1_c40ilq0,t3_qtm8c,null,1428516721,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

My daughters now live in New Basford with my Ex.  

Primary schools can be hit and miss where ever you go, the biggest thing i found was making sure my girls had the right Secondary school to fit their needs as opposed to anything else.  Luckily both of mine are very technical so going to Djanogly Academy as they do pushes them towards IT/Technical things which they enjoy.

Even the worst areas can have good pockets and vice versa.

**Clifton** - Generally nice young family estate which several primary schools and 2 decent technology based secondary schools available. Very self contained estate. Handy for buses back to Loughborough etc

**Aspley/Broxtowe('Broxta')** - Less affluent then Clifton but reminds me of several areas of Clifton 20 years back.  2/3 Primary schools available.  Catchment area for 4/5 Secondary schools(Sports/Technology/CofE based/All Girls)

**Bulwell/Top Valley** -  Like Aspley and Boxtowe, Bulwell/TV is looked down upon by the middle class areas of the city. 1/2 Secondary schools(Sports/Technology)

**Arnold** - Similar to Clifton but feels older and has that little town feel as with Clifton. Other side of the city though.

**West Bridgeford(WB)** - Very affluent area 2/3 good comprehensive schools.

**Chilwell/Beston** similar to WB

**Meadows/St Anns** - synonymous with Nottingham's old 'Shottingham' title from a few years back.  Still trying to pull them selves out of a bad period.

**Hysen Green/Forest Fields/Sherwood** - Very multicultural area with several primary schools and 1 main secondary(Tech) available, others are available. Close to the city without being in the centre. Lots of terraced houses with a 70s/80s feel somedays with kids out enjoying the street with not a care in the world.

As for Ireland, I don't really side with one or the other as it's based around religion and is therefore automatically designated as 'daft' in my book (nutjobs on both sides!). To continue raging today about how one side should be favoured over the other is (for a start) to ignore how long the Protestants have been there; you can't carry on treating them as 'invaders' after several hundred years. And likewise, if some of the protesants want to indulge in triumphalism because of a battle that's from so long ago as if it means anything today, then that in itself is a bit pathetic (until it's legitimised by the Catholics that decide to bite). As you illustrated, Protestants sure do a lot of dumb things, but that goes both ways too - it's not because of the Protestants that the vast majority of Irish women have to fly over to England to get an abortion (and in the 90's, the Irish Gov. was taking out injunctions to stop women even being advised of it as an option - as if people weren't aware already).

The fiestas in Spain have even older roots, but for example you're not going to get Muslims protesting that the Christians are using it to lord their victories (or vice versa) - because (rightly) that would just make one side (or both) look stupid.

I think we'd be mental not to play Ramires, he's been one of our better players this season. Mikel had a good game midweek, but I've never been a massive fan, so I'm not sure this is the time to be risking it. Malouda should never, EVER play. Ever. Meireles is inconsistent, which is the problem which is why I'd go for Lamps anyday of the week. I'd also agree Luiz could play RB, and do a decent job, but I'm not sure this is the time for experimentation and I think he'd need time to get used to it. Ivanovic probably will get turned inside out in this game unfortunately due to the pace of Napoli, there isn't much we can do but ensure Ramires comes back to help. Sturridge on the left will cut inside and take shots, which is fine if Drogba has a bad game. I want to see Torres play or come on and score, I really do, but I'm not feeling it at all. Not a fan of Kalou either. Basically, I'm not convinced with our sub options if things go tits up.

This being said, I'm fairly certain we'll play 433, tried and tested, standard formation, studge on the right, Mata on the left. Ramires/Lamps/Essien in the middle. 

With Cavazi and Lavezzi (can we please sign one of these in the summer??) upfront, we need to face up to the fact that Napoli WILL score. I'd be very surprised if they didn't. This means we need three goals just to take it to extra time. We need the first two goals, because if Napoli score before then they will go italian, and more defensive (I realise they're probably the least Italian team ever with three at the back, but it'll happen, it's in their blood).

That being said, defensively, they're as bad as us this season. There are goals out there for us. Both teams will have good chances. It's up to us to put them away, or it'll cost us.

There's two problems with that. 

Firstly, we only know what the media reports. The media is mostly full of shit, written by incompetent and/or biased fools looking only for sensationalism. If you don't take these things with some healthy skepticism, you're an idiot. 

Secondly, what *we* are is fans. Fans are judged *only* by one thing - supporting their team through the thick and thin, especially if the people at the helm are those we know love the club just as much as we do. We're not the fucking board of directors. We're not playing Football Manager. We do *NOT* know what is best for the club simply because we do not have the full facts. First and foremost we should be supporting our team publicly. Also, I'm pretty sure that none of you have won continental and domestic titles both as a player and a manager through a decades-long career. Show some fucking respect towards the people who *made* this club. 

I'm not saying that we should blindly cheer and support whoever is running the club. We should take actions when necessary - and we have, in the very near past, when fan support was influential in ridding Liverpool of the plague of H&amp;G. I'm saying we should act like proud, dignified and knowledgeable football fans who are capable of forgiving mistakes made by those with only the best intentions for the club in heart, because guess what, we all make mistakes.

I think your lineup is spot on, though.  I really would be interested to see how this team would play with a second striker, but as Moyes once said, ""If I had my way, I would love to sit down with people and ask to hear them explain the strengths of 4-4-2 compared to the 4-4-1-1 which we play. If you ask me, I'd argue all day long.""  So yeah, that's not happening.

The ex-editor of The Telegraph (Will Lewis) was by that stage working for News International as one of their big cheeses at the management level, overseeing their British newspapers and digital news operations. He was evidently still in close contact with senior staff in the Telegraph newsroom, as he was given a copy of the recording.

He then leaked it to his good friend Robert Peston, the BBC's business reporter, who broke the story and broadcast the recording. This is not the first time that Lewis has leaked stories to Peston, by the way.

So the Times wasn't involved in breaking the story, but one of News International's high level managers leaked the recording to a friendly journalist.

Obviously, the recording had a detrimental effect on Vince Cable's career, and probably a positive one on Murdoch's efforts to buy out all of BSkyB. Anyone smell a conspiracy theory?!

true,[deleted],null,null,"Definitely a sweeping statement, I don't really agree with, even though it is a massive exaggeration for those who think after one bad result he needs sacking, but he definitely is only a stop gap, as if you look at it, his skill set is lacking, he isn't a paticularly good tactician, he isn't strong in the transfer market, he isn't the best at motivating players, especially those who have had their confidence wrecked like Carroll. But even if you put all that aside he is old, which even though isn't a overly big problem at the minute, FSG have a plan, and surely this plan is longer than how long Kenny has left in the game.

The only problem is, there not a lot round there who could do a better job, with all the top managers realistically out of our grasps, unless we take the risk on AVB. I definitely can't see that happening though, especially since a lot of the lesser informed fans would see it as taking a Chelsea reject, and may not get behind him, which was his problem at Chelsea. So even though he could possibly be the bright young manager we need, he is out the running.

Which only leaves Benitez, of the top established in England managers, who is a step backwards in my opinion, even though he is a brilliant manager, its best to not drag up the past. 

So then you have foreign managers, which means a bedding in period for them to learn English, and settle to the EPL's rough and ready attitude. It also means people will be quick to turn on him, like they did with Benitez, calling for a British manager again.

I am speculating.  I wouldn't say without foundation though - as my previous comment puts the facts in order.  Why would they do it?  Because they weren't in a position to win the election.  Which they didn't.  When Brown came to power in 2007 an immediate election would probably have seen him win.  Even with a massive financial crash, mass outrage at expenses and an uncharismatic opposition leader the Tories still didn't manage to win it really (yes, yes, I know they got more seats than anyone else, but they didn't get a majority).

Were Labour up to it at previous elections?  Who knows.  We know that Tony Blair was cosying up to the Murdochs, but they're high enough up the organisation that they probably have plausible deniability.  We also know that it was a Labour MP (Chris Bryant) who was particularly keen to get this investigated further and that Tories didn't want to (BoJo claiming it was just a Labour PR thing and that it wasn't anything worth spending time on).

That's somewhat different, because we know the Doctor is the central character of the show. He can't die, dramatic as though the trailers will be. 

Harsh as it sounds, companions come and go. If there is to be any sense of death meaning anything in the *Doctor Who* universe, it lies with them.

That's why I do greatly respect Karen Gillan's wish that when she leaves *Doctor Who*, the door will be closed. No bringing her back every few years for big reunions.

&gt;But having them actually be killed would really change the tone and feel of the show in a way that I personally don't think would be pleasing.

Companions dying is not without precedent. It doesn't need to be a bloodbath.

/bitter

In all fairness, they are a decent side under a decent manager. Form goes out of the window on occasions like this, these aren't normal games, so the fact that we've been good recently and they haven't doesn't really matter. This is the perfect game for them to rally and turn their form around, just as it is the perfect time for our run to come crashing down. 

However, this squad is much stronger than the one that started against them earlier in the season, and we played well for the thirty-or-so seconds that we had 11 men. I would go for that same starting XI as you vanderburg. It's a tough choice of whether to start Straq or Jelavic though. Straq would be useful for battering their defence while they also kick lumps out of him, but there won't be too many chances and I trust Nikica more to finish them. That, plus the fact that this is child's play compared to the Old Firm derby, means that I'd probably go with Jelavic, with Straq coming on for Cahill to pester their tired defence. Anichebe would also be a great late option. Drenthe is also a bit of wildcard; I'd trust Coleman more not to accidentally kill someone, but this is also the kind of game where Royston's maverick personality could win us the game. Oh, and it'd Heitinga and Distin at the back all day long for me. Johnny has been immense recently, and Disitn has been solid for about two seasons now. Jags needs to earn back his place in my opinion, although of course he is still a very good centre-back. Plus, Johnny has definitely been giving off some Evertonian vibes of late, I think he's really started to love the club and the fans!

It was a brain melting 69º degrees in Lisbon last Friday...

I'l bet you anyone not from Manchester was pretty fucking pleased to be in the sunshine for a minute. Fuck, anyone from Manchester would be glad to be there.

I've no doubt there's probably a bit of disgruntlement in the camp because they've played badly in two games and Mancini's pissed off. Any minor rumblings are down to that.

All as it should be. There's no mutiny. The players know they are better players and we're a better team this season *because* of not *despite* Mancini. We're in the hunt for the title having played some of the best, most devastating football in the league *because* of Mancini, not in spite of him.

There maybe one or two who want him gone because their career isn't going the way they want it but most of them know their pay packets are down to him and with him gone they risk being another Wayne Bridge when another manager comes in.

In a nutshell, it's load of nothing spun to fit an agenda. For example, when Oxlade-Chamberlain (can anyone think of a posher footballer's name ?) skulked off the pitch yesterday he wasn't ""angry"" or ""upset"" with his manager. He was a young player (some might say this makes him additionally disrespectfu) ""hungry to play."" It's the same scenario as Barry, a senior player who wanted to play. It's all how it's framed by the press.

""City players a bit down after successive defeats,"" is not quite the headline though.

""Over the years I have argued that football is a stupid game in which 22 overpaid nancy boys with idiotic hair run around a field attempting to kick an inflated sheep’s pancreas into some netting while an audience of several thousand van drivers beat one another over the head with bottles and chairs.

 Nor could I understand how someone from Tooting could possibly support, say, Manchester United, a team sponsored by those hateful bastards at AIG and made up of players from Portugal, France, Holland and, in the case of Wayne Rooney, Walt Disney. Where’s the connection? What’s the point?

 I have also suggested that it’s preposterous to have football stadiums in the middle of cities. Why should anyone be delayed by match traffic just so a handful of thugs can watch a Brazilian man falling over?

 And as for those people who can’t cope if their team loses. Give me strength. If you get all teary-eyed just because someone from Latvia, playing in a town you’ve never been to, for an Arab you’ve never met, against some Italians you hate for no reason, has missed a penalty, how are you going to manage when you are diagnosed with cancer?

 I have always hated football, but then one day, out of the blue, my son announced that he had become interested in Chelsea. This was a living nightmare. If he’d said that he’d become interested in smoking, I could have made all sorts of threats. If he’d said he’d become interested in homosexuality, we could have talked. But a football team? I had no answers. I didn’t even have any questions.

 However, because he spent so much time watching football on television, I started pausing to watch. And I began to think that actually it’s a very beautiful game when it’s played properly. And that the offside rule, really, is no more complicated than the average power station. And then I started picking up bits of information from the commentators, which meant, for the first time ever, that when conversation with friends turned to football, I could join in, instead of sticking my fingers in my ears and singing sea shanties.

 This meant that pretty soon people started asking if perhaps I’d like to go to a game. And that’s why last weekend I was at Stamford Bridge watching Chelsea demolish a team I used to call Manchester City. But that I now know is called Useless Money-Wasting Scum.

 This was my first Premier League game and, ooh, it was good. When you’re there, rather than watching on television, you get an overall view, which means you can see how the game works. You notice that Frank Lampard is like a blackbird, always looking around to see where the hawks are. You see that Carvalho runs with his arms up, like a begging puppy, and you work out that Michael Essien always seems to be able to find a piece of the pitch that the Useless Scum either hadn’t noticed or were frightened of.

 The other advantage of being there is that on television the microphones are positioned so you can’t hear the chants. I’d heard, of course, about this mass spontaneity over the years, usually when a team is playing Liverpool. “Sign on. Sign on. With a pen in your hand. Cos you’ll ne . . . ver get a job.” Or: “The wheels on your house go round and round. Round and round. Round and round.”

 There are others too. Plymouth Argyll refer to any team they play as northern bastards. Then you have the Charlton fans who travelled down the M4 to Reading recently and, having failed to think of any suitable abuse, came up with: “What’s it like to live in Wales?”

 The Chelsea fans topped all this last Sunday with a nonstop song, the lyrics of which were: “F*** off, Robinho. F*** off, Robinho. F*** off, Robinho.” I joined in wholeheartedly, even though I wasn’t entirely sure who Mr Robinho was and why I wanted him to eff off so much.

 No matter. It was all so brilliantly working class. Or it would have been, had I not been seated in a private box just outside the no-jeans-allowed Armani Lounge, where I’d feasted on smoked salmon and quaffed bucks fizz before kickoff.

 But I got a reminder of footballing’s outside-khazi and jumpers-for-goalposts roots when Chelsea scored. I turned and smiled a patronising smile at the man sitting behind me, the former Independent editor and all-round crap driver Simon Kelner. It turned out he was a big fan of the Scum and, honestly, I thought he was going to kick my head off.

 I wouldn’t have blamed him. I used to be surprised that football fans fought one another. Now, though, having experienced the white heat of pride and tribalism first hand, I’m surprised they don’t any more.

 After the game I was taken to the Chelsea dressing room so that I could admire all the players’ penises – many were very enormous indeed. I talked to Roman Abramovich, who was charming, and Lampard, who, having just run around for 90 minutes, still found the energy to get the entire team to sign my boy’s Chelsea shirt. I don’t do that for kids who come to the Top Gear studio and I’m supposed to be the public-school-educated toff.

 So there we are, then. I am now a football fan. I know this because in one afternoon I learnt I’m not a football fan at all. I’m a fan of Chelsea. Chelsea are the only team that can play. Chelsea players have by far the most impressive reproductive organs. Stamford Bridge is my church. The men who play there are my Gods.

 In short, I have a team, and that’s what’s always been missing. Because I was born in Doncaster.""
_______________

This makes me laugh even more when he mocks the other football teams and Rooney, Scholes etc. In the latest episode he even talked about his friend going to Stamford Bridge.

In another episode he said that the Evo 10 which is a fantastic car is like Chelsea. 

But his digs at ManU make me laugh the most.

**15 minute edit**

Great start, downing attacking the full back and getting crosses in, Suarez looks dynamic, Carroll is looking good in the air and the rest of the team look up for it. Howard's made a couple of good saves but we're giving him all sorts to think about at the moment.

**Half time edit**
1-0 up, fair reflection of the half. We've seen winger getting crosses in, our full backs getting inside of Evertons, some great passing and very tight defending. Very pleased at the moment and wouldn't mind seeing more if it.

Looks really defensive, but can be very attacking in practice. We're expecting Napoli to drop deep, so push both Ramires and Cole up to basically play as wide midfielders to give us width. This lets both Mata and Sturridge come in centrally to their preferred positions. Luiz and Cahill can take it in turns to push up unexpectedly while Mikel drops in whenever they do that.

true,Xaethon,cnty-uk,Manchester &amp; Salop,"Looking through the copy of the letter from the Home Office my MP sent to me after I enquired to him about the case of Richard O'Dwyer, it says (and I quote):
&gt;In a case where the Home Secretary decides to order extradition the person concerned has the right of appeal against the decisions of both the District Judge and the Home Secretary.

This which is found on the CPS website (House of Lords now the Supreme Court I believe):
&gt;[Appeals against the decisions of the District Judge and/or the Home Secretary go to the Administrative Court. Notice of appeals must be given within 14 days of the decision. The Administrative Court must start to hear the appeal within 76 days of the notice. It is possible to appeal from the Administrative Court to the House of Lords, but this can only happen if the Administrative Court certifies that the appeal involves a point of law of general public importance and either the Administrative Court or the House of Lords grants leave to appeal.](http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/fact_sheets/fs-extraditionpart2/#_09)

I believe that should this appeal fail, he gets one more appeal attempt (I believe) with the European Court of Human Rights.

In fact, looking through this letter again:
&gt; Any alleged offence for which a request for an extradition is made would have to come within the requesting State's jurisdiction, as well as being an extradition offence as defined by the Extradition Act 2003 for the request to be valid under UK law. The UK courts have held that the US authorities have jurisdiction in relation to the offences of which Mr O'Dwyer is accused and are entitled to seek his extradition.

I believe that says thatt the alleged offence (which I can't seem to make out what it is in this case) that comes from the requesting country (in this case America) in which they had the right to request this extradition. This offence must be stated in the Extradition Act 2003 for this request to be allowed under our law (which it seems it has been), so his extradition has been allowed for that.

I can't make any sense out of the [Extradition Act 2003](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/41/contents), in fact I also just realised I can't answer your question.

Individually, unions help it when an employer decides to shit on you personally by giving you legal advice and representing you in disciplinaries - in my experience, much to the consternation of management, who *hate* having someone who actually knows the law facing them across the table. 

The unions should be given back the powers they were stripped of by Thatcher's edicts in order to better protect workers during this time of the governments' austerity measures. Employers are taking this to mean that they can cut corners in looking after their staff, and without effective unions, a lot of people are taking unnecessary cuts to their hours, their pensions, or even losing their jobs.

But I'd also like to add that Moffat seems to have had more trouble with pacing and lots of issues with character development during s6 that I hope he addresses. The reason everyone was so thrilled with The Girl Who Waited, IMO, was that it's centered on the emotions and interactions of the central characters, which is an important part of what made Moffat's RTD-era episodes so strong. We can have all the time travel in the world but without emotional grounding in characters we understand and care about, it's just so much theatrics (my main complaint with series 6).
