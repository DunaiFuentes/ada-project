It looks like the white part is 20 rows long, the yellow part is 70 - 72 rows long, and the maroon part is comparable to the yellow part, but I can't see it well enough to get any sort of count. This is knit in a fairly small gauge, so if you wanted to go on 8s or 9s, you'll probably need to guesstimate a length for each section.

Yeah I guess I kinda half did a pattern there...lol I'll see if I can clean it up and figure out measurements and get back to you.

EDIT: It looks like the yellow and maroon sections are around 6 - 8 inches long. Maybe 10"". If my earlier row count is anywhere near correct, the white part is a 3.5 ratio to the yellow/maroon. So...2-3"".

How I guesstimated: The span of one's hand is approximately equal to the length of one's hand. My brother-in-law is close in build to Matt Smith, and my brother-in-law's hands are 8"" in length (he brags that they are an exact measurement. He's an engineer, if that explains anything). Trying to account for perspective, it looks like the yellow section is about the size of the span of the Doctor's left hand (a little smaller in the picture, but farther from the camera). The scarf seems to be 4 - 6"" wide.

What I would do is do a gauge swatch and try something in the ballpark of those measurements for a single repeat of maroon, white, yellow, white.

I hope that helped even a little...Sorry it's so all-over-the-place.

I like the Eredevisie because it represents value for money. Every club in the Dutch league knows that somewhere down the line, they will sell their best players. Even the largest clubs know that their finances are not competitive in the world market.

Secondly, a lot of players in the Eredevisie are taught to play a European style of pass and move football. It makes sense for our club, moving in the direction that we claim to be, to make purchases at a slight risk for high potential players who have already been brought up to play in that style. 

There are a lot of other players in the league that I think would also be great additions to our team. I know this thread was about wingers, but players like Jetro Willems and Nicolai Boilesen would make great squad players for our team. People are talking up players like Nick Powell and how great he is, but he would cost upwards of £5-8m or more.

Ok. So, we both have different opinions on the attacking midfielder situation: You don't think it's good enough and it needs more players, I think it's a chance to develop younger players into the first team as I rate the likes of Jonjo and Hendo. Fair enough. 

The other two positions I have mentioned (although, actually it was mentioned as examples), we have a different case, we have relatively few or no backup in those area. If Brendan wants to develop players from the youth ranks for these positions, hey I'd prefer that. And if players are brought in for these positions, I'm okay with that too. Now, if you ask me about buying a new central defenders, I'd prefer not. You see, my view on promoting players is situation specific not the be-all, end-all solution.

I'd really like to discuss more about Enrique and Robinson, but that's for another topic.

This is verified by various reports, but mostly in Dutch and requires Google Translate. 

I think that while Holland is a great place for scouting, and the quality of players there have been improving rapidly, there is a little too much space in their football, and players are usually not physical enough. Most of the top rated youngsters there can do spectacular things with their 3rd and 4th touch, but in England you need to do it on your 1st and 2nd touch.

My answer is ""yes"". Without the monarchy we'd have to have a president or some other series of checks and balances such as they have in America, which would not only be more expensive than the current system but more prone to corruption.

At the moment the royal family does a rather decent job of being an apolitical balance for a rather minimal cost. I don't pretend that you could ever manufacture our system - ours only works because the monarchy is so steeped in tradition and royals are born knowing their duty is to their country.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;That's a claim that someone has made on this thread and is made in other places. I'm merely asking for people to provide some evidence to assert that claim. If it's a true statement there should be available evidence to back it up. 

That's right - someone has stated this because it's considered common knowledge and easily google-able, which is my point - feel free to do the research for yourself, but you *don't* get to call things a 'claim' simply because you haven't verified them yourself or had it done for you on reddit.

&gt;It's still not very convincing though is it?

If you don't think a sample of 25,000 is big enough, then good luck with that. You're right about the Queen being third, although considering you're insisting that the Queen is almost irrelevant to the numbers visiting, I'd say it still points to people generally not following your assumption.

&gt;If people were coming specifically to see her you'd expect Buckingham Palace to be the number one drawcard but it's way down the list after the Tower of London, Grenwich and Cathedrals, all of which exist without her.

Indeed - but previously you were suggesting the royals made no difference at all; now you're suggesting that they don't because she's not top of the list - beware of the No True Scotsman trap. It appears that you're still trying to seperate the royal residences/ attractions (Tower of London, etc.) from the royals themselves, as if they/ the Queen isn't part of what draws people, which is where you fall down - these places draw such large crowds partly *because* they're still associated with the royals. Would they sell without them? Yes. Would they sell as well as they do with them? Based on the appeal of the Queen, etc., you'd have to prove this is the case over asserting otherwise.

&gt;Are they seriously trying to claim that the only reason people visit these wonders of architectural, historical and religious significance is because of the Queen? And what about the National Maritime Museum? Seriously?

No, they're pointing out that the royals are part of what attracts people to these sites, and the royal sites are one way of getting as close to them as possible which means more people visit than would normally visit just the site for its' own sake. People go to BP thinking that they *might* see the Queen, despite knowing that they almost certainly won't - you appear to be applying your opinion to the tourists themselves and then questioning their visits based on the same.

&gt;That link actually proves the Royal family's tourist draw is way over rated.

Over-rated how? Because BP or the royal sites aren't the best-selling thing in the UK? Following that logic, would you argue that bands like Pink Floyd are over-rated because they haven't outsold everyone else in the world?

&gt;More than ten times as many people want to see modern art than see where a Queen lives, what does that do for your princess theory?

Absolutely nothing, because you're now making a chart and dismissing everything that's not the most successful. Doesn't work like that.

&gt;It does nothing to back up the claim that The Royal Family bring in a lot of tourist dollars.

Actually it does - and (once again) it's still not a claim, unless you're actually going to provide links to the contrary; you're just overlaying your opinion onto the people doing it.

&gt;It does nothing to back up the claim that The Royal Family bring in a lot of tourist dollars. 

Yes it does, but despite my illustrating how (with examples and figures), you still consider it a 'claim' without having done any research or provided any links yourself. Seperate the royals from their residences in your head all you like, but that doesn't mean others do - demonstrably so. Tourists generally love the royals and everything associated with them; the postcard example alone shows your sweeping statement to be untrue.

You don't seem to realise that you're already in the position of having to show how tourists can love the royals, love the royal sites, but somehow don't connect the two (with the increased attraction that comes with it).",0,1339059695,null,0,false,0,c4xdx6k,t3_ukys4,t1_c4xdx6k,t1_c4x6q4k,null,1429087527,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ott/travel-trends/2010/index.html

If we are talking about the economic benefit we must only include data about international travellers. Figure 5 (Overseas residents' visits to the UK by purpose) shows that out of about 28 million visits in 2010 15 million are categorised as coming to see 'friends and relatives' or here on 'business'. 3 million are 'miscellaneous', leaving only 12 million here 'on holiday'. Monarchists would have you believe that people would stop visiting if you removed the monarch, however that is clearly not the case with the worst case scenario being a ~30% decline, and of course it is absurd to believe that all of those people on holiday are only here for the queen.

This data is backed up at [visitbritain](http://www.visitbritain.org/insightsandstatistics/inboundtourismfacts/index.aspx)

&gt; **Journey Purpose and Seasonal Spread**



&gt; In 2011 nearly two-in-five inbound visits to the UK were for a Holiday (39%), while just over one-in-five (23%) were for Business.  Looking at the share of visitor nights by journey purpose it is clear that trips to Visit Friends or Relatives (VFR) account for the largest share (39%), thanks to the fact that these trips involve a longer than average length of stay.

Others have cited visitbritain's article claiming monarchy generates 500 million. However, the same article can be used to disprove the significance of the monarchy. Out of 4.6 billion£, 0.5 billion seems to explode the myth.

&gt; [Our ""culture and heritage’’ in the widest sense - extending from theatres, galleries, to pubs, Premiership Football, castles and stately homes - generated £4.6 billion in total spending by overseas tourists in 2009, and supported 100,000 jobs, the report said.](http://media.visitbritain.com/News-Releases/Monarchy-brings-in-500-million-a-year-from-foreign-tourists-says-VisitBritain-research-5d2.aspx)

Edit: 

&gt; Then potential tourists were also asked to choose from 15 postcards that they would send to communicate that they were in Britain. They ranged from The London Eye, Tea to  Red Phone Boxes. The icon picked by the most respondents was a red double decker bus (24%) followed by a stone castle by the sea (20%). **But the third most popular choice, at 11% of respondents, was Queen Elizabeth II, well ahead of fish and chips or draught beer.**

There you go, there is conclusive proof after all! Only 10% picked Elisa! So more people identify the physical castles and red double decker busses with Britain than the monarch. (But at least she beat fish and chips, because that would have been embarrassing.)

true,kitd,eng-hampshire,'ampshurr,"I wouldn't call myself an ardent monarchist by any stretch, but I am broadly in favour of it for 3 (fairly abstract) reasons:

1. They personify the nation. Having a head of state that is outside politics (unlike the US) keeps the political class constitutionally in the position of servant (even if they don't act like it sometimes). Also, don't undervalue the idea that the armed forces swear allegiance to the monarch, not the ruling executive. 

2. They personify Britain's history. Sometimes the press are full of debates about ""what it means to be British"". For me, Britain is *defined* by its history. I saw it once remarked that Britain is to history what Iceland is to geology. The origins of how the modern world got here (democratic government, industrialisation &amp; modern agriculture, rational science, banking &amp; commerce) are still all around us in Britain but most take for granted. The monarchy is this crystallised into a personal form (make sense?). 

3. Changing to a republic implies that there is some problem with the current system that needs fixing. I just don't see it. If we want to discuss mere money, I suspect you will find that the net cost of a regularly elected president would be close to what we pay for the monarchy, but I can't back this up with figures so would be open to correction.

true,NeoNerd,null,null,"First off, I hope you enjoy your trip! Edinburgh's a great city, and a lot of fun.

1. The easiest way is  the Airlink bus service. This costs £3.50 for a one way ticket, or £6.00 for a return. This leaves from just outside the airport, and arrives in the centre of the city, just outside the railway station. The bus service in the city is great. Most people buy their tickets on the bus. A one way ticket for any length of journey costs £1.40. So that could be two stops, or the entire length of the route. A day ticket costs £3.50. This allows for unlimited bus travel that day. 

2. There's a lot of shopping. The St James Centre is the most central shopping centre. It's located at the Eastern end of Princes Street. Princes Street in general has excellent shopping, as does George Street, which is one street over. If you're looking for jeans/t-shirts, then Topshop or H&amp;M on Princes Street are probably the biggest chains, along with Primark (which is very inexpensive).

3. Not very big, I'm afraid. It's not tiny, but there's not much to do overnight. Most things open at around 4:30 to 5:00 in the morning there. How early does the flight leave? The earliest Airlink bus leaves the city centre at 04:30, and arrives around 05:00. That might help you.

4. It would be safest to root for France, not England. Not that supporting England will get you attacked in most places, but it might get unfriendly comments. I'm afraid I'm not very good with sports bars. I mostly watch them in my local pub.

true,TheToiletDuck,null,null,"1) The airport bus is the easiest way to get from the airport into town, i think it's about 6quid return (3.50 one way). It will take you right into the town centre (Waverley Station). You can buy tickets at the booth next to where the bus leaves (outside Departure gates).

Regular buses are 1.40 flat fee per journey for the greater Edinburgh Area (not sure what a day pass costs since the price increase a month or so ago, it used to be 3 quid). 

They sell the tickets on the bus but you cannot get change so have the correct amount. You can also use machines scattered around the place but i wouldn't recommend it as once you've bought your ticket a bus has to come within 30mins before the ticket expires (but most drivers don't care).

Pro-tip: sit at the front of the bus on the top floor and you can pretend you're driving.


2)Edinburgh isn't great for shopping to be honest, Glasgow is much better. I'm probably not the best to answer for female clothes though. I guess if you want real cheap you could go to Primark on Princes Street. I actually got not a bad hoodie there for 10quid, and a polo for 4quid.

3) The Airport is quite small. Thankfully there are seats without arm rests but i would still prefer to stay in town and catch a bus in early. There are 2 (?) bars and about 5 or 6 places for food.

4) Absolutely no doubt, France.

Sheesh really? It's a claim until it's backed with evidence when it becomes a fact. I'm asking for the evidence that will turn the claim into a fact. Just because others repeat the claim doesn't turn it into a fact it just makes it a popular claim. Millions still claim you can see the great wall of china from space but they're wrong you can't. As I've said I tried to find the evidence myself and couldn't find any. 

Lets just clarify. Your link doesn't prove that people come to England exclusively because of the Royal family. What it proves is that a collected group of attractions with links (some of them very tenuous) to the Royal family are generating 500 million pounds per year. It doesn't go any way to proving that people wouldn't visit those attractions because of the current Monarch and it doesn't prove that people visit the UK exclusively to see those attractions. 

Here's an interesting set of figures[ from the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/feb/23/british-tourist-attractions-visitor-figures).

The Tate Modern and British Museum are clearly huge drawcards pulling in over 5 million visitors a year which is more than double the highest ""Royal"" attraction (the tower of London at 2.5 Million). Clearly tourists are coming to the UK for a range of reasons with modern art and history being highpoints. 

Even if you believe every visitor to the Tower of London set foot inside the building because of the Queen (which is clearly an absurd claim) and even if you then claim that every one of those people came to England specifically to see the Tower because of the Queen and no other purpose (which is again absurd) then that's only 2.4 million visitors (assuming every one of them is visiting from outside the UK (another absurd claim).  Even if you accept that every building on that list of Royal Attractions only generates visitors because of the Queen it's still outstripped by the three top art galleries/museums who easily pull in more with 15 million visitors a year. 

You haven't actually proved anything (I suspect not even to yourself) and that link has demonstrably destroyed your argument. Even the bit about the postcards is meaningless, even if we did know what all 15 postcards they were shown were (which we don't). 

I'm asking for evidence to back up the claim that ""The royal family bring in a lot of money in tourism"". I would like evidence that people come to the UK specifically because of the current Royal family and wouldn't come if they didn't exist. Telling me that lots of people visit the Tower of London isn't evidence of anything except one tourist attraction's popularity. 

Try again (only this time without trying to distract me with rock band analogies. I love Pink Floyd but I know a diversion tactic when I see one and I rightfully call bullshit on yours)

The more interesting part is the ethics and how someone can claim what is ethical. To do so you need to apply one of the two basic frameworks we have been discussing (or potentially the third of Aristotle's polis, but we'll ignore that for now).

Now, you have every right to argue that the deontological approach is the only way to frame ethics, many do and it is the most commonly seen in recent years with things such as Human Rights movements ect. But to do so you have to concede that the consequences are not a factor in your decision, this is the underlying argument behind not using torture for example. 

Alternatively I would argue that certain situations are better placed into a utilitarian framework, taxation being one of them. By definition taxation is technically theft if the owner of the money wishes not to give it to the government and theft is unethical from deontological perspective. But from a utilitarian viewpoint it is more ethical as the result is beneficial to the greatest number of people and therefore in my opinion it is justified. Another example might be that lying is unethical, but if you lie to murderer and save lives, it is morally/ethically acceptable. It is right to say that this is not  applicable to every situation as for example gang raping a woman repeatedly may offer the greatest pleasure to most amount of people and consequences are often unforeseeable.

In the case we are arguing, i.e the current British monarchy either ethical framework can argued with a strong case, personally when taking into account the whole situation as it is, I take the utilitarian viewpoint on this particular situation.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;As I've said I tried to find the evidence myself and couldn't find any. 

That's because you've set yourself criteria that means you can ignore stuff like the visitbritain site. Not the same thing, as demonstrated.

&gt;Your link doesn't prove that people come to England exclusively because of the Royal family. 

Correct, no one has stated that they do.

&gt;It doesn't go any way to proving that people wouldn't visit those attractions because of the current Monarch 

Actually it does, by illustrating that the royals are popular generally. You'd have to prove the royals aren't popular with tourists and that nobody visits BP because the Queen lives there (for example) for this to be considered.

&gt;and it doesn't prove that people visit the UK exclusively to see those attractions. 

Correct, no one has said they do. You could make that argument about almost any attraction in the UK.

&gt;Clearly tourists are coming to the UK for a range of reasons with modern art and history being highpoints. 

That's where the royal sites have the advantage - they're sites of interest anyway, but they're *more* popular because of the association with the royals, some to the extent that they'd get a fraction of visitors otherwise.

&gt;even if you then claim that every one of those people came to England specifically to see the Tower because of the Queen and no other purpose (which is again absurd)

Which means you have to prove that those numbers would be the same *without* royal association.

&gt; Even if you accept that every building on that list of Royal Attractions only generates visitors because of the Queen it's still outstripped by the three top art galleries/museums who easily pull in more with 15 million visitors a year. 

Again with the top ten. Not sure what this illustrates.

&gt;You haven't actually proved anything (I suspect not even to yourself) and that link has demonstrably destroyed your argument. 

No, it's bolstered your statements in this comment that weren't being argued anyway. I've pointed out that these sites get *more* visitors than they would normally, because people who come to the UK generally want to see stuff associated with the royals. You then have to illustrate that there's no connection between the tourists' desire to see royalty and their subsequent visits to the royal sites to further your assumption, which you haven't.

&gt;I'm asking for evidence to back up the claim that ""The royal family bring in a lot of money in tourism"". 

I've given you figures for their sites, to which you've questioned the connection with the royals. I've then given you examples (like the postcard) of how popular the royals are with tourists making their sites a bigger draw, and how to try and seperate the two is daft without proof. The onus is now on you to provide that proof.


&gt;Telling me that lots of people visit the Tower of London isn't evidence of anything except one tourist attraction's popularity. 

No it doesn't, but asserting something you can't prove (that attendance figures wouldn't change with no Queen connection) then insisting that your assumption must be true anyway won't get your very far. Highlighting that people visit the likes of BP far more than Leopold's palace in Brussells illustrates that sites that have royals sell more than sites that don't, as well as the issue of the UK royals being the most famous in the world.

&gt;Try again (only this time without trying to distract me with rock band analogies. I love Pink Floyd but I know a diversion tactic when I see one and I rightfully call bullshit on yours

Really? Who introduced the idea of a more popular attraction invalidating the ones in question? Stay out of the charts, and I'll stop using chart analogies - you might want to smell your own bullshit before deciding on someone else's. 'Diversionary' is failing to provide any links that have any bearing on the discussion. You're not the only one that can smell bullshit, and I've backed up my statements with links instead of procrastination.

&gt;**Redrawing Europe**

&gt;The EU is reaching the point where it cannot continue to be ambivalent about these two models. In the UK, but also in some other countries, there are growing public demands for a principled and consistent position to resist any further merging of the two, because the people in these countries want to remain self-governing. Yet these same countries see the argument for greater integration within the eurozone to help to resolve its continued crisis. The solution is to enable those countries within the eurozone who wish to integrate further to do so and to allow those countries who do not ever envisage becoming part of the eurozone to remain in a restructured single market.

&gt;For this to happen without long and tortured arguments, challenges to the legal interpretation of European treaties and allegations of bad faith, all member countries must be involved as equals in a restructuring of the EU.

&gt;**The European Community**

&gt;All countries should remain full members of a single market, which would form the basis of a larger, separate organisation. It should continue to operate under qualified majority voting based on a revitalised single market, and would hopefully include Turkey as a full participating member, as well as other members of the European Economic Area. Such a grouping of 32 or more states could be called the European Community, funded and controlled by its member states. It would have common international environmental policies and could use the old political co-operation mechanism to co-ordinate foreign and security policies, with Nato membership enjoyed by most of its constituents. The EU would continue to lead in devising legislation for the wider single market but not as the ultimate authority.

&gt;**The European Union**

&gt;What will also emerge as part of this restructuring is a eurozone in which economic, fiscal and monetary policies, taken with the Lisbon treaty arrangements for foreign and security policy, will develop in ways that involve, to all intents and purposes, though not in name, a single government. This will probably be acceptable for most, but not all of the existing eurozone countries and potentially for others who intend to become members of the eurozone. Such a grouping would continue to be called the European Union.

&gt;Some of the countries, particularly Germany, want further economic integration beyond the fiscal compact agreed in December 2011. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, made it clear to her party, the Christian Democratic Union, this year that she saw Europe as a “community of destiny” and she will ask for a mandate to achieve that from German voters in the autumn election of 2013. The present opposition party, the Social Democratic Party, shares much of her vision.

&gt;There will be resistance to the German design of a fiscal union from France, but François Hollande, the President, is likely to choose to continue the Franco-German project to make a success of their single currency. With a reinvigorated political Right, Mr Hollande might have difficulty in winning a referendum in France. But even if he lost, Germany would not let the euro fall and return to the deutschmark. It would assemble a small group to keep the euro intact and expect, at some later date, that the number of eurozone countries would increase.

&gt;**The debtor problem**

&gt;Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Spain, inside the eurozone but with mounting economic difficulties, may find public criticism of austerity too strong to withstand. The public may demand more and more measures for growth and in the process become resigned to leaving the eurozone. What is not clear is whether, if they leave, these countries will be able to stay in the EU, hoping to rejoin the eurozone; if they are not welcome, they will be fully entitled to be members of the single market and European Community. 

Personally, I'd be in favour of staying within the wider European Community, but not in the European Union.

&gt;That's because you've set yourself criteria that means you can ignore stuff like the visitbritain site. Not the same thing, as demonstrated.

We've already proved that link weakens the argument rather than strengthens it. But nevermind if the claim is demonstrably true there would be lots of other proof out there. I can't find it but I assume you can.



&gt;Your link doesn't prove that people come to England exclusively because of the Royal family.
&gt;Correct, no one has stated that they do.
&gt;It doesn't go any way to proving that people wouldn't visit those attractions because of the current Monarch
&gt;Correct, no one has said they wouldn't.
&gt;and it doesn't prove that people visit the UK exclusively to see those attractions.
&gt;Correct, no one has said they do.

Yes they have. That's what ""The royal family bring tourists to this country means"". People claim it all the time. They don't say ""The Royal family are one of a wide range of factors..."" They make these claims. 

&gt;but they're more popular because of the association with the royals, some to the extent that they'd get a fraction of visitors otherwise.

Evidence? I'm asking for evidence not just your opinion (which I'm valuing less every time you post)

&gt;Which means you have to prove that those numbers would be the same without royal association.

I don't think you've fully understood the claim thing. I don't have to prove anything because I'm not making the claim. I'm asking for evidence to prove a claim and you're not giving me any.

&gt;I've given you figures for their sites, to which you've questioned the connection with the royals. 

Rightfully too. St Pauls cathedral is a functioning place of worship first, a place of architectural and historical significance second and a royal attraction a distant fourth. Pretty much everything on that list is only tenuously connected to the royals. You might as well claim The Beatles attractions in Liverpool are Royal attractions because they got MBE's and Paul's been knighted. 

&gt;I've then given you examples (like the postcard) of how popular the royals are with tourists

Potential tourists (the sample wasn't of visitors only potential visitors. Whatever that means. And without knowing what the other postcards are it's a meaningless statistic. It could have been a double decker bus, The Queen and a bunch of big brother contestants. The postcard is a really tragic straw that you keep grasping at (and since a double decker bus is twice as popular it' doesn't really help you much either)

&gt;No it doesn't, but asserting something you can't prove (that attendance figures wouldn't change with no Queen connection) then insisting that your assumption must be true anyway won't get your very far.

It's got me to a point where I've out argued you so far. Remember you're the one making claims here. You're claiming the visitors to the Tower of London are doing so because there is a current Queen but you've provided no proof. 

&gt;Highlighting that people visit the likes of BP far more than Leopold's palace in Brussells illustrates that sites that have royals sell more than sites that don't, 

The Palace of Versailles gets more visitors that Buckingham Palace and that has no royal family at all (and hasn't for years). So that's shot down that point then.

Try again. You might need a new link since we've proven that you're own does nothing to back up your case. In fact here's a new way it shoots it down. Apparently of the potential tourists surveyed only ""60% said that they would be likely to seek out places associated with the Royal Family or British monarchy."" That means 40% have no interest in anything royal and wouldn't visit any when they were in the UK. So of those 60% who visit can we prove that they're coming spefically because of the Royal family? (which is the claim you're trying to prove after all). It appears that state proves that 40% of potential tourists don't give a flying fuck about royalty at all. Oh dear. Another nail in that websites coffin.

Still that's okay. If the claim is true there should be loads more sites out there you can find which will prove it, why not find one of those instead? Or would you rather try and bullshit me further with Pink Floyd distractions and diversions. I suspect I know which.

That isn't really how tourism works. Very few people will come just to see the royal family, but it is one of many small things that adds up to make the UK a popular tourist location.

You could make the same argument for any publicly funded tourist spot: ""Is there any evidence that tourists would stop coming tomorrow if we closed and sold the British Museum?"".

&gt; Almost three quarters of the public believe that they still own the money they deposit in the bank, however, under British law the customer has no specific claim of ownership of these assets, as they become the property of the bank and are treated as loans from the depositor. The famous legal case of Carr vs Carr (1811) established that putting money in a bank was not an act of bailment, but rather was a generalized debt (from bank to customer). This seemingly innocuous change opened the doors for fractional reserve banking. Suddenly, the bank was not responsible for the specific asset the customer entrusted them with, only the generalized debt. This allowed them to take a portion of the deposit and loan it or invest it. Consequently, banks became responsible only to repay the customer the amount of the deposit, while the depositor had no specific claim of ownership of the assets deposited. Only 8% of the public understood this point, whilst 16% believe that both the account holder and the bank share ownership of the same resources.",0,1339067628,null,0,1339095090,0,c4xeil9,t3_uo1st,t1_c4xeil9,t1_c4x3lih,null,1429087874,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

To make a long story short BTCB never really managed to convince everyone that they were the best organisation for British Taekwondo leaving many choosing to train by themselves.

In the case of university Taekwondo this decision resulted in much mudslinging between BSTF (Whom were the student branch of the UKTDC) and BTCB, from what I heard both side accused each other of mismanaging event and basically it got to the point in 2008-2009 where Taekwondo was stroke from the BUCS.

As such its easy to see why Aaron Cook decided to train by himself and from what I have seen of his training and fights he deserves to be our 80kg fighter.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;We've already proved that link weakens the argument rather than strengthens it. 

No, 'we' haven't. *You've* asserted, and haven't backed it up with anything other that your own speculation.

&gt;But nevermind if the claim is demonstrably true there would be lots of other proof out there. I can't find it but I assume you can.

I've provided a link that was the third one down for 'british monarchy tourism'. You can find more yourself - or (whisper it) a site that confims your speculations that isn't a top-ten-destinations list.

&gt;They make these claims. 

Based on statistics (like the link) or obvious connections like the royal's popularity. 

&gt;Evidence? I'm asking for evidence not just your opinion

I've already given it - dismiss the link all you like, without surveys or data of your own, your view is an speculative opinion and nothing more. Then there's evidence like Leopold's palace in Brussels, for example. To clarify, you have to demonstrate how the royals' popularity is in no way connected to the site visits for it to be worth exploring whether their connection is relevant.

&gt;(which I'm valuing less every time you post)

Your valuing of my posts is worthless and the fact that you point it out says more than you seem to realise about your own hubris. So far, it's based on predetermined, ignorant opinions and the cherry-picking of info that support them, while failing to provide any links of relevance and getting upset when someone uses the same analogies you do - so, excuse me while I don't lose any sleep because you can't be bothered to teach yourself.

&gt;Rightfully too. St Pauls cathedral is a functioning place of worship first, a place of architectural and historical significance second and a royal attraction a distant fourth.

Wrong - you're still trying to seperate these places from the royals as if every tourist will follow your lead, which isn't how it works. And if you think St. Paul's is primarily a place of worship, try walking in just to worship without paying. There's a (very) small chapel to the left as you enter for precisely that purpose.

&gt; Pretty much everything on that list is only tenuously connected to the royals.

You make sweeping statements like this based on what appears to be not much more than your opinion - I'm starting to see a pattern here. Good luck with applying that to Hampton Court and the like.

&gt;You might as well claim The Beatles attractions in Liverpool are Royal attractions because they got MBE's and Paul's been knighted. 

That's an interesting analogy - if Paul still lived in his childhood home, do you think it would get more visitors?

&gt;Whatever that means

It means 'if you were visiting the UK, which postcards would you send home?'. Didn't appear that complicated to me, but note that without any information of your own, you're now quibbling with the tourists themselves.

&gt;And without knowing what the other postcards are it's a meaningless statistic. 

So The Queen is the third most popular postcard, but you think that's irrelevant because you don't know all the other entries. Er....righto. We're back to the charts again; did the Beatles ever dismiss getting to number 2 with a single because they didn't know the other entries?

&gt;It could have been a double decker bus, The Queen and a bunch of big brother contestants.

Does that sound likely? And ultimately, what difference does it make?

&gt;The postcard is a really tragic straw that you keep grasping at

It's a statistical survey. Very 'tragic' compared to the, er, mountain of evidence that you've provided to the contrary. Which would be zero.

&gt;(and since a double decker bus is twice as popular it' doesn't really help you much either)

Oh, we're back to the charts, are we? Want to actually explain this relevance, since you keep bringing it up but get upset when I use it to point out the flaws in your assumptions?

&gt;It's got me to a point where I've out argued you so far.

*Sure* you have, I'm collapsing under the weight of non-links. Your out-arguing has consisted of repeating your opinion, to the point of trying to ignore websites and tourist surveys that go against it. With no evidence *at all*. Yeah, you've really got me on the run.

&gt;Remember you're the one making claims here. 

Actually, I'm not. You're 'claiming' with no real evidence that the royals make no difference to visiting figures. I've shown how they do, with a survey you tried to dismiss until i pointed out the size of it (and even then, you're doing your best to paint it as irrelevant, which is both tragic and entertaining). After that, you've only provided your opinion and a tourist chart that you seem to think somehow demonstrates that if the royal places aren't at the top...well, actually I'm not even sure what you think that proves. And you consider this 'out-arguing' someone?

&gt;You're claiming the visitors to the Tower of London are doing so because there is a current Queen but you've provided no proof. 

No, I didn't. Maybe you should start quoting more, then I won't have to keep correcting you quite so much. I'm not even sure you need anyone to be here, you're so good at making up what you want to be the case when things aren't the way you want. Shall I quote where you've done this? It might be a long post.

&gt;The Palace of Versailles gets more visitors that Buckingham Palace and that has no royal family at all (and hasn't for years). So that's shot down that point then.

And I have an example of somewhere royal-related (Brussels) that doesn't, which illustrates how that example isn't good enough. You need to prove that the numbers visiting UK sites would remain the same if the royals suddenly vanished, which means demonstrating that tourists don't visit the UK with any interest in the royals at all. Good luck with that, because (repeating yourself aside), using the most popular visited building in the most popular visited country is going back to chart territory. Again.

&gt;Try again. 

Links, please. One of us has provided relevant ones, and it isn't you.

&gt; You might need a new link since we've proven that you're own does nothing to back up your case.

You might need a link, full stop. And who is 'We'? I assume that by 'we' you mean 'you'. *You* have attempted to dismiss the stuff in that link with nothing more than your opinion and an obvious no-true-scotsman argument about how popular the Queen is, something you've then repeated even after I've pointed out the no-true-scotsman aspect of your comments. Not good enough.

&gt;So of those 60% who visit can we prove that they're coming spefically because of the Royal family?

Now you're cherry picking *within the same sentence*. The beginning of that statement - ""60% said that they would be likely to seek out places associated with the Royal Family or British monarchy."" - means that you now have to prove that they don't. Or that they'd be just as keen if those places *weren't* associated with the monarchy/ royal family. Easy for the Tower of London - elsewhere, not so much. Funny that you're using words like 'desperate' when we're down to 'only' 60%, and you have to use words like 'apparently' for a published survey and are still trying to dismiss such statistics because they don't tally with your opinion.

&gt;(which is the claim you're trying to prove after all). 

Errr...no, actually, it isn't.

&gt;It appears that state proves that 40% of potential tourists don't give a flying fuck about royalty at all. Oh dear. Another nail in that websites coffin.

Really? Where did 'we' decide that all tourists are rabid royalists? Oh dear, you've disappeared up your own backside. Again. I'm sure the website is panicking already.

&gt;If the claim is true there should be loads more sites out there you can find which will prove it

Er...which part of 'it's your turn for links' did you not understand? Newspapers quote the one I provided. The only person quoting your opinions is you.

&gt;Or would you rather try and bullshit me further with Pink Floyd distractions and diversions.

Ah, of course - when you use chart listings as some sort of proof to address stuff people haven't said, that's OK - now look at your reaction when I do the same, especially when you then go on to do it *again in this post*. Not hypocritical (and doesn't make you look dumb) in any way at all. But do provide a list of subjects and methods you intend to use that I'm not allowed to go near.

&gt;I suspect I know which. 

It would be better if you confirmed stuff, or provided your own info instead of assuming I'll do all the googling for you when I find stuff you can't really address - suspect all you like, your opinions are still flyweight speculations - and considering you're so keen to throw your toys out of the pram, I wonder if you've already tried googling and haven't found anything of worth. Still, carry on in ignorance, it's really working out well for you so far :-)

The gulf between what I own and what the Royals own is unfathomable. Also..when I die someone will have to pay inheritance tax...the royals don't. Some people when they die their houses effectively (if no one else claims it) goes to the crown. The Royals, just by being the Royals have such an advantage over the rest of us Its not really practical or fair to compare the moral basis for the land they own against the land we do.

I'm not really against pointless traditions (hell, im not even that against the royals) but you have to understand, we have a family who are effectively worshipped, who effectively ""better"" than us, who have a higher value than us. And just makes no sense. Its unfair and its unjust.

Besides, You don't just ever face in the same direction at all time, especially if you are in what appears to be a fighting space...

I would also suggest that since Angels have great levels of psychic energy, they could also ""pick up"" the fact that the silent is behind it somehow. The memory ability must use some sort of psychic field somehow anyway in additional to normal levels.

Bottom line: I'm not disagreeing with the fact that the angel would forget, but an angel can do a lot and are very powerful and clever in the time that a silent could blink.

true,lol_oopsie,null,null,"I'm quite surprised that it isn't already illegal under existing laws.

And even if it IS outlawed by new laws, I don't see how it's enforceable. Most of the ""forced"" marriage is through emotional manipulation, not duct taping your mouth and shoving you into the boot of a car.

My friend is Pakistani (a guy) and his parents are bullying the SHIT out of him to marry a girl from Pakistan. They said that if he doesn't do it, they'll kick him out of the house and not speak to him again. His mum is ill and also gives him emotional stuff like ""I'm going to die soon, and I'll die unhappy if I don't see you married"". But he's 25, so it's not like they're kicking out a child. They have no legal responsibility to him at all now. Basically he's powerless. And as much as I like to tell him to move out and tell them to fuck off, he's not going to say that to his whole family of parents, brother, brothers wife, brothers two kids and his sister who all live together. They're pretty wealthy and live in an 11 bedroom house btw, not all crammed into a tiny house.

Interestingly, he has to fly to Pakistan to marry her, but then he comes back alone while they spend 6-12 months doing paperwork to get her over here. They need to show that it's consensual and that they love each other (not sure how, since they've never met or talked ever before). The council also have to come and look at your house to ensure she has good living conditions and you aren't keeping her in a wooden crate with air holes or something!

It's fascinating.

That a resource exists does not make it usable. Extracting that resource and manipulating it to add the utility to make it useful is where property ownership is useful. A plot of land in and of itself is worth a lot less than farmland, a house or a gold mine.

In fact, people sometimes compare us to Norway which isn't even in the EU, as Norway has to implement most EU directives to stay competitive in the european market (without representation!). I wonder if they ever talk about 'democratic deficits'? Norway even pays part of the EU budget, something close to €130,000,000. I'm sure you can find some right winger to find out what that costs per person per day, to exaggerate a figure most people don't realise isn't very much.

I'd also like to add that if we stay in the EU, to retain representation and abide by the new rules (I imagine there will a majority ruling rather than every country has to agree to implement), eventually over an extended period of time we will become so entrenched in laws from the EU that the whole continent will be more or less homogeneous in that respect. My point is, I feel like as a continent we are too far down the rabbit hole to come out now. If we leave the EU we will still be implementing EU law (a la Norway) without any representation in EU parliament. This is why I don't understand why people say 'leave the EU in the name of democratic legitimacy!'. Well no, if we left there'd be even less democratic legitimacy, but the media seems to have a good eurosceptic thing going at the moment.

And to be fair, I don't know any government who would really want to repeal the laws just in the name of euroscepticism. Maximum work week? Getting rid of that wouldn't go down well. There's a new law that is attempting to unify mobile charges, I doubt people would want rid of that, E numbers allow for people to understand what they're consuming across the continent. There are lots more. Plus, I'm not very fond of the idea of being tied to this tiny island for the rest of my life (EU ensures free movement and equality of all people across europe). At least I know I can move to Germany tomorrow if I want, or Spain, or Greece.

Then on the note of people complaining about all these eastern europeans, did you know there are a million britons in south spain? There are even more strung all across Europe. If there is ever a vote (I'm sure there will be) I imagine we will stay in the EU, just remember as you go to the poll that leaving is not as good an idea as ITV/The Sun/The Daily Mail/The Telegraph would have you believe.

It may not be in the interests of all the ""community"" to contribute to the cost. For example a type of metal may only be used by one group inside the community, where is the benefit for others? If you allow any form of diversification you open the door to an imbalance unless you impose draconian rules upon others.

&gt; I think this is a fairer way of running society than merely ""finders keepers"", or historically, on the use of force.

Given where we are now and focusing on ideals rather than trying to ammend history I'd suggest we 're better expending our efforts on improving social mobility. It is impractical and equally unfair to start attempting to right every wrong from history, not to mention that what we consider ""wrong"" is true only for our current accepted moral standards and as even a cursory glance at history shows that moral codes vary dramatically and are culturally dependant.

&gt; Animals are quite clearly not our equals. This is a strange argument.

I expected you to say something like this and my point is you're basically invoking [special pleading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading). Humans are animals and conceptually we are no different from any other animal. It has been shown that monkeys, apes and dolphins are amongst many animals that have some degree of intelligence. Even birds have been shown to learn, adapt and use tools.

true,jaysabi,tardis,TARDIS,"I like your idea and your conclusion, however I disagree with your premise that the angels turn to stone when viewed by the audience through the 4th wall. The audience isn't part of the Doctor Who universe. We are simply viewing the events that transpire there as semi-omniscient beings. (That is, we know some things the characters don't, but we don't know everything, otherwise we'd never be surprised.) So you cannot assume that the angels are stone because the audience is viewing them as opposed to the more likely scenario that we are viewing them as stone as a consequence of the angels being viewed by some being within the DW universe. Further, you cannot assume that the ONLY time the angels are stone is when they are being viewed from within the DW universe. Although it is a ""fact of their biology"" that they turn to stone when viewed by any being inside the DW universe, we don't know that they cannot simply turn to stone at will as well, so seeing the angels as stone cannot be assumed to be a function of the audience viewing them.


That said, I'm not entirely sure you need that piece to reach your conclusion, which as I said, I rather like. I think the fact that they are ""creatures of the abstract"" is enough to grant the conclusion that they take on whatever properties are believed about them. This can then be used to explain the retcon issues, especially all the added characteristics the angels took on after Blink later that violate earlier canon, which honestly really bothers me. 


I love the idea that as creatures of the abstract, they take on whatever properties are believed about them. That would answer the question of why they can't move in Blink, but their heads can be viewed to move, as Penguin pointed out, in Time of Angels and Flesh and Stone.

This is anecdotal. We have no idea what economic benefit actually occurs. The idea that Britain would be forgotten about should the monarchy disappear is not convincing.

If you wanted to see the harm you would easily find it. The monarchy is cover for a particular type of currency over a particular domain. I've said this dozens of times now, but there's the monarch, a 'ceremonial' hand waving apolitical grandma, then there is the wider monarchy that includes heads of church, a protected private company, parliamentary influence, special legal mechanisms, *the judicial system, police, tax havens, etc.**

Because if we stopped paying them then they would stop paying us.  We would lose about £160 million a year if we were to stop paying them.

As is the gulf between what you own and what any number of millionaires own.  This doesn't mean that they have less of a right to it than you do.

&gt;Also..when I die someone will have to pay inheritance tax...the royals don't.

Ok, you've got me there, but many rich families avoid paying taxes.

&gt;I'm not really against pointless traditions

Really, because that's not how it sounded earlier.

&gt;we have a family who are effectively worshipped, who effectively ""better"" than us, who have a higher value than us. 

Really, because I certainly don't worship them, and by the sounds of it, neither do you.  They are celebrities by birth, but that's not uncommon, just look at Paris Hilton or Peaches Geldoff.  I'm not sure what makes you think that they are better than us...  And in terms of value, many people are valued higher than you are, any politician, celebrity, or other public figure is valued higher than you.

&gt;Its unfair and its unjust.

Yes, something we can agree on.  It is unfair, these people are in the public eye from birth, they can't make the same mistakes everyone else can.  They can't choose to be doctors or binmen, they have to serve their country for their whole lives, they have almost no choice in this matter.  They pay a vast amount of money for the privilege of working their whole lives and get a few benefits in return.

1. Airlink is the dedicated airport shuttle bus. £6 gets you return, £3.50 single ride. Will take you around 20-30 minutes to get in/get out. It goes past Haymarket and terminates at Waverley, so will go past most of the really central points of Edinburgh.

As others have already mentioned, the bus 35 is a far cheaper alternative; £1.40 takes you single ride, £3.50 is a day ticket for all the Lothian buses (the ones with burgundy red details in their painting). This takes quite a bit longer though, count on a good 45 minutes until you start hitting central Edinburgh, closer to an hour to get to where you can walk to Grassmarket and the hostel circuit.

It's also worth noting that 35 runs a fair bit further south than Airlink: make sure you check it out on Google Maps (the local transit route description will include 35 when it is useable) -- it will take you past Fountainbridge, West End (almost by Tollcross), the University campus (central campus, not King's buildings), and then down the Royal Mile before it takes off out towards Leith. 

2. In addition to all the other shopping suggestions, I have to put one in for the second hand / charity shop market. It's quite a different scene from what we have in Scandinavia, and well worth checking out. I have heard from good authorities that the charity shops in Morningside are spectacular -- but there are charity shops all over the place, and they have often surprisingly good merchandise at ridiculously low prices.

3. Nothing to add.

Also, as I said, its inherently more democratic to be inside the EU. We'd still be abiding by their rules if we were outside. On top of that, while inside the EU, if our political leaders showed some integrity they might try to sway opinion to our benefit. But no, they stand around moaning about the EU all day. It's ludicrous. 

I'd also like to point out that this was all a trade union at the start, so politically obviously it isn't going to be a perfect democracy. The leader of the liberal alliance in parliament said that he wanted one single directly elected EU president. You'll hear the eurozone leaders talk about political union now, notice how they do not consider us in political union right now. When political union eventually comes, democracy will come too. I think we live under this assumption that the political system in brussels will never change, but it changes every time we have a treaty.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Actually, it was made abundantly clear in the classic series that it was indeed a physical limit. The Master spent centuries as basically a skeleton thing when his 13th life ran out. He didn't suddenly decide he could break the rule. He used undefined ""powers"" he gained from briefly controlling the power of the Keeper of Traken (conveniently the name of the story I'm referencing) to steal the body of a Trakenite dude named Trimas thus becoming the Master as portrayed by Anthony Ainley. Then in the horrible Fox movie he somehow became a snake-thing after death that possessed a human (Eric Roberts Master). The Timelords then ressurrected the Master (via the Matrix I'm guessing since he still had the same identity) for the Time War and he ran away to the far future (Jacoby- Simm Masters).

The Fifth Doctor story *Mawdryn Undead* also makes it abundantly clear that the regen limit is in the Time Lord biology. The entire *Trial of a Timelord* arc is pointless if the limit was just an edict. 

ALL that said and I'm totally fine with the Doctor having extra regens because River gave him hers or because of the Time War for some reason. But it was a built-in physical limit. It is spelled out as such in the classic series, a few times.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Okay, quick general overview. Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans/companions along with him to see alien worlds and history. We've had approximately 784 episodes (32 seasons) but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in nearly anywhere.

The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a you will like. 

Don't like the eleventh Doctor? Try the tenth! Also, Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 (seasons 1-26) then relaunched in 2005 (seasons 27-32/series 1-6).

But by no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv). You should choose the 2005 point.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

And no matter what you do, watch all six series. And if you like them, there's always classic who... :D",0,1339082340,null,0,false,0,c4xgr3v,t3_upnns,t1_c4xgr3v,t3_upnns,null,1429088929,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

So why not get rid of that concept if it is so inconsequential? Why not change it to the people?

Charles has frequently whispered in the ear of parliament; the full extent of this we will never know. The 'Royal decree' has been used as recently as 2004 (re: Chagos islanders). I've not made any effort of a conspiracy theory, but you've been trained to use that idea to discredit anyone that questions the legitimacy of power. I bet you picture a tinfoil hat also.

Do you understand what a conspiracy is? I define it as a network that limits information within itself, yet carries out actions that have consequences outside itself. The monarchy fits that model perfectly, but of course all you have to do is call me a conspiracy theorist and I have as much credibility as David Icke.

As for financial conspiracies there is no greater than the network of tax havens under her royal highness. But the actual point I am making is that the idea of an apolitical impotent monarch is completely false, that is undeniably factual. Here's another conspiratorial fact: the monarch has copyright over all official Canadian publications. You have to get permission and pay a royalty to distribute them!

How is it more efficient for people to profit out of money lending than to remove the profit, as in a credit union. Banks should not be able to create credit, that they can is essentially theft.

Here's a great [comment on HackerNews](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3607784) a while back about this topic:

&gt;Can I add to this one little point, which is a counterintuitive thing you can do to help your local library:

&gt;Use your local library.

&gt;During the year we started Matasano our Chicago team spent about 40%-50% of our time working from the Oak Park Public Library, sometimes in meeting rooms we booked, more often at study desks. It was great. The Internet access wasn't amazing but it was totally functional and we could VPN out through it. The desks and working space were if anything better than what we have now (and we really like our office).

&gt;There were times I worried that we were being a burden, but the impression I get is that it's the opposite. What's deadly for a local library is for nobody from the community to be using it, for it to have no stakeholders from the tax base of the community. The library staff was always welcoming to us.

&gt;Your hip coffee shop on the other hand hates you with a passion it normally reserves for Scott Stapp solo albums. At the coffee shop, you take up space in a business that's driven by turnover. Someone's going to chime in here with a story about a coffee shop that truly loves the startups that park themselves at their tables and order 3 count them 3 cups of coffee in a day, but I've talked to hipster coffee shop people oh-yes-I-have and at least some of you who truly believe you're doing your coffee shop a favor are being tolerated gracefully, not welcomed, like you would be at your local library.

&gt;Libraries have an obvious role to grow into as IT hubs for their communities, now that so much of their knowledge-disseminating role has been subsumed by IT. But another related less obvious role is as a hub for local entrepreneurship; thing thing ""hackerspaces"" are supposed to do, but are (for so many companies) suboptimal at.

They used for all sorts of things like helping people learn English, fill in forms, find jobs, study, use the internet, etc.  Many people ignore the fact that some people can't afford to have a computer + a broadband connection + ebooks.",0,1339085621,null,0,false,0,c4xhijy,t3_upy07,t1_c4xhijy,t3_upy07,null,1429089289,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Think of each actual Angel has having a unique identity, afterall, they are living creatures. If the image of a specific Angel is captured on film, that image can itself become an Angel. But in The God Complex, the angel in that room wasn't a specific Angel that had an identity beforehand. It was completely conjured up on the spot by someone's fear of the angels generally.

true,JamesM_,eng-durham,Durham,"Money being created is a misnomer. Private action creates value, which is attached to money. It increases the value of money.

The bank of England prints money - it de*values* the currency by doing so.

There is a value attached to ""all the pounds in circulation"". That value is mainly due to supply and demand forces. The more pounds you print, the more pounds that value has to be divided by so each pound is itself worth less.

The Bank of England isn't a private institution, it is a government institution that is quasi-autonomous. Quantitive easing is a form of monetary policy - these are covered in the economics GCSE.

You won't find an answer to the pure question ""where does money come from?"" because the answer is complex. Instead you'll find material that builds upon itself to eventually enable you to answer that question. A search through revision notes will be unlikely to give you a decent result! :)

Awareness is pointless. People (in the general, sheep like sense) are made aware to things that affect them and that they can understand. Monetary and fiscal policies are difficult to be made simple.

In essence, your question is too simplistic. You need to go back to basics to get the answer - my economics course started with the simple question ""what is money and why was it created?"", to which the answer is of course solving the mutality of wants problem (I have a cow, you have a pig. If I want your pig, you must also want my cow in order to complete the trade. We can't do anything if you want a chicken instead).

Once currency is in circulation, it itself becomes a tradeable commodity (assuming you have multiple currencies such as in different countries), so its value rises and falls depending on supply and demand.

true,dayus9,eng-gloucestershire,Lincs,"It's not a stupid question but it is a very complicated answer to tell you everything. 

Basically I use barracks because it's a word people understand and can relate to, but these days it's rarely what people think, like dormitories of people all living together. That sort of thing does still happen but mainly very often at the beginning of one's career during basic training and sometimes in trade training, and sometimes when visiting another unit where accommodation is scarce. 

I'll try to cover the main instances, and be assured that when I say having sex I mean ANY kind of sex, there is no difference between gay and straight sex in the forces, we do not differentiate, everyone is equally shafted. :) 

**Basic training**
This is where you get the more dormitory type rooms, at RAF Halton which is our basic training base the barrack blocks are segregated, males and females sleep in different buildings but share rooms, anything up to ten per room I think these days. The males are banned from the female building and the females are banned from the male building, no exceptions. Anyone caught breaking those rules is in for a world of pain (just using an expression, we don't beat recriuits, they would face disciplinary action). I suppose if two guys or girls wanted to get it on in the accommodation, then they could, but it really doesn't happen, people having sex in a room full of other people, maybe it does now and again, but I'm old and my basic training was before 2000 so I can't tell you if gay sex happens in the communal rooms during basic training. I'd be surprised though, I know I'm not interested in getting it on with anyone when people are trying to sleep.  

**Trade Training**
After basic training recruits go to learn the job they are going to be doing in the RAF. Almost all of our trade training bases now have single rooms, people have a bedroom to themselves, often with communal showers and washing facilities. Some units will have rules about members of the opposite sex not in the buildings after certain hours, some may even still ban members of the opposite sex from going into the buildings, but we're not stupid, we know it goes on. I suppose technically the gay guys get a benefit from those rules if they're strictly enforced, but they aren't often enforced unless there's a very good need to or you get a twat in charge. 

**During the normal career**
Once you're in the 'real' RAF and doing your job, living on base, again you get your own room. There are rules in place to stop men just wandering into the girls' buildings, but there is generally nothing stopping anyone from inviting anyone else into their room for a shag or whatever, as long as they're sensible about it and not having wild sex in the corridors at all hours of the day. 

**In war zones**
I don't know if it's banned, but I have no idea where people would do it anyway. If caught having it away by someone, it's indecent exposure or something that they would do you for. 

**tl;dr:**
 In a nutshell, gays and straights are treated equally, although the rules can actually benefit the gay people more than the straight ones sometimes. Nobody can tell you not to have sex, but they can ban sexes from mixing in certain situations, like during basic training and trade training to a point. If people want to get laid there's times and places where they can easily do so, and they do. When we're in our careers proper, we pay for accommodation and what we do in it sexually is our own business. 

I hope that helps to clarify. ",0,1339088266,null,0,false,0,c4xi5hq,t3_umxyn,t1_c4xi5hq,t1_c4xec4m,null,1429089588,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Guardianista,cnty-uk,London/Exeter,"&gt;When political union eventually comes, democracy will come too.

Personally I find it abhorrent that democracy has been suspended in the name of union. Who's to say (especially considering the anti-EU feeling in many countries at the moment) that the UK would not become a lighting rod for those countries who want to remain in Europe but still keep control of their own fiscal policy?

40-50% of our trade being with europe is not a reason in itself to allow our sovereignty to be overridden. It is a reason to seek closer ties and more deregulation, not more regulation and inseparable bonds. 

You also make the assumption that by retaining sovereignty we are rejecting membership of the EU entirely. Not the case. Simply we are refusing to integrate areas of social, financial and foreign policy without representation. The idea that Europe would not agree to let us into a common market is as ludicrous as us leaving it.

Finally we will always have a seat on the security council as long as we:
1.) Are one of the worlds arms manufacturers
2.) Have nuclear weapons

I would watch it series 1-6, and then go back and watch the original episodes if you like. All of the episodes are on Netflix now, so it is easy to watch series 1-6. Just a heads up, there are a few episodes (mostly specials in season 4) that aren't on the normal list for Netflix. You have to search them separately. Just follow [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials) to make sure you are watching the episodes in the correct order.

One allows the user and/or the company to dictate what is aired (users have a say by refusing to watch what they consider trash, less views = less profit, less profit = more likely to be dropped.) based on personal opinion or financial gain. ie. Capitalism. 

Arguably this is only a hairs length from Corporatism where Corporations power exceeds the government and they can dictate the political process, but we're not quite there just yet so it's a hypothetical reach.

The other is allowing the government to have absolute control of what's broadcast which can easily be abused to push political doctrine, which is not that far from an Authoritarian regime like North Koreas.

It would be bloody boring if we didn't have that lot to entertain us.

I'll reevaluate when ER has gone, but for now every thing's fine and dandy. Ditching the monarchy isn't going to affect anyone's lives positively, but there certainly is the possibility of legal and constitutional clusterfuck when the Crown Estate is sold off piece-by-piece by either a financially precarious Windsor family, or by a money-grabbing government. Even if it did go to the National Trust there would be a firesale of areas deemed ""surplus or not worthy of preservation"" and I do not trust such a process to work in the wider public interest.

We need perspective, people want to talk like some powerless, over-worked granny bouncing between charity and state events has any effect on democracy compared to what's going on in Brussels - we can't see the wood for the trees, in this regard.

She's a head of state who treats the position with the respect it deserves: a lifetime's commitment, political silence, fame, and a nasty case of tennis elbow. Contrast this with Blair or Clinton, who serve their time at the top table working in their own interests or niche political beliefs, get a book deal, a speaking tour, and generally disgrace themselves and their position. Imagine the British head of state being tainted by that Iraq shit, or any other political debacle. It would destabilise and polarize us like the French or Americans.

I'd prefer to keep it with the trained and educated individuals whose life and career is dedicated solely to that service, bringing all the ambassadorial benefits of a ceremonial head of state without the politicisation.

In Edinburgh, Primark probably hits your description and it's right in the middle of Princes St. On the same street are a bunch of shops you could look in, maybe Topshop, H&amp;M, Next?

The shopping malls and out-of-town shopping centres (basically malls without roofs) are generally samey and have the same high street shops. Plus some have TK-Max which is one of those discount shops for end-of-line items, if you get lucky you can get good bargains there, but it's a crapshoot. 

The possible exception is the centre in Livingston. To be honest I don't know much about it, but I've been told it's decent.

'3. Edinburgh airport is fairly small but there is a bar, restaurant and so on. Generally it's advantage is that you don't have to spend a lot of time there...

'4. Depends what pub you go to for the football. Most pubs go for France. I mean really, it's embarrassing. In more... Upmarket pubs it's more tolerant, though I still wouldn't be rubbing faces in an English win. If you're around Edinburgh University area you should be able to find a pub that has a large English contingent. 

Need to know what you're looking for if you want tips. Food? Pubs? Taking the walk up Arthur's Seat is the done thing. Visit the royal mile (High Street on maps). Castle is expensive - it's the done thing and nice views but I sense very tight budget so may well not be worth the money. View from Arthur's Seat or Carlton Hill (NOT AT NIGHT!) is on par with the Castle. National Museum of Scotland isn't nearly on par with, say, the British Museum in London, but it's okay and free.

Weird firefly aliens can't survive in a gravity well and are a human symbiote seeded by even yet still more aliens that also seeded humanity, and um, once we get off this rock they can contact us. So, long story short, human + firefly = symbiotic being that can photosynthesize and live in the vaccume of space. They become completely separate from us because they no longer have any human needs. It's really irrelevant except that it shows how two species can quickly diverge into being unable to understand each other at all if they don't share any common ground.

I'll summarize. 

People make the **claim** that ""The Royal family bring in tourism"" The burden of proof is therefore on them and not on me.

I have asked for **evidence** to back up that **claim**.

You have provided one link which does nothing to satisfy me and you can't explain why it should. You obviously hoped I wouldn't read it and even tried to sneak a lie in (The Queen is the most popular postcard tourists sent home) hoping I wouldn't notice. Since I actually read it and questioned it you've tried to distract and cloud things over. That hasn't worked either.

Even though I'm not making any claim at all, and therefore have no burden of proof, I provided one link (from the guardian) which proves Royal attractions are totally dwarfed by non-royal ones. You've totally ignored this link. If we're taking turns with links (and we're not) it's definitely your turn now. I've challenged you to find other links to back up your claim and you have been unable to. 

You then typed a massive, tedious and irrelevant post which must have taken ages to write and would have taken me a long time to read if I'd bothered. 

So let me ask you a very simple question that I'd like answered.

2.4 Million people visit the Tower of London every year. What percentage of those people would stop visiting the tower if the Queen sent herself into exile and lived in a retreat in Scotland?

Its biggest problem is just how linear the game is, it honestly feels like you are just walking down corridor after corridor.

It does however look great, and i love the physics, especially when you just keep emptying your clip into some unlucky sonovabitch, in slow-mo.

It's also incredibly cinematic, which can be a huge downfall. Its right up there with MGS4 for 20min cut scenes for every 10mins of gameplay.

Still recommend people buy it and play it however.

true,OJSlaughter,eng-buckinhamshire,Aylesbury Vale,"&gt;I'd like to throw in here that we are in fact the least integrated country in the EU. We're not even in Schengen, which means businesses from around the world who want to go to europe have to get two visas, one for everywhere else and one for the UK+Ireland. 

Due to the way tax laws work, a business will only base it's headquarters in one EU nation. So Visa's are a non-issue here: travel across the channel is very easy regardless of passports being needed.

&gt;In fact, people sometimes compare us to Norway which isn't even in the EU, as Norway has to implement most EU directives to stay competitive in the european market (without representation!). 

There is little in the comparison and I don't see why people keep making them.

&gt;I wonder if they ever talk about 'democratic deficits'? Norway even pays part of the EU budget, something close to €130,000,000. I'm sure you can find some right winger to find out what that costs per person per day, to exaggerate a figure most people don't realise isn't very much.

Yes. Norway obeys both trade laws and pays upkeep of various trade incentives. I bet most Eurosceptics will be happy to keep this arrangement for the UK too.

&gt;My point is, I feel like as a continent we are too far down the rabbit hole to come out now. If we leave the EU we will still be implementing EU law (a la Norway) without any representation in EU parliament. This is why I don't understand why people say 'leave the EU in the name of democratic legitimacy!'. Well no, if we left there'd be even less democratic legitimacy, but the media seems to have a good eurosceptic thing going at the moment.


EU law can easily be repealed. The country could just accept all EU law and start repealing it from there: very simple. The EU is a very undemocratic union. Even if it was more democratic, the average Briton will have much less representation due to the size of the population.

&gt;And to be fair, I don't know any government who would really want to repeal the laws just in the name of euroscepticism. Maximum work week? Getting rid of that wouldn't go down well. There's a new law that is attempting to unify mobile charges, I doubt people would want rid of that, E numbers allow for people to understand what they're consuming across the continent. There are lots more. Plus, I'm not very fond of the idea of being tied to this tiny island for the rest of my life (EU ensures free movement and equality of all people across europe). At least I know I can move to Germany tomorrow if I want, or Spain, or Greece.

See, as someone who would like to keep the Trade Union part: I have to agree with you in part. Still, I don't understand how you are not getting that the UK can just keep the laws it likes.

&gt;Then on the note of people complaining about all these eastern europeans, did you know there are a million britons in south spain? There are even more strung all across Europe. 

There is also over a million in Australia, over half a million in the USA and Canada and fuck load across the globe. Should we also have social policy with them too?

&gt;If there is ever a vote (I'm sure there will be) I imagine we will stay in the EU, just remember as you go to the poll that leaving is not as good an idea as ITV/The Sun/The Daily Mail/The Telegraph would have you believe.

First there's the thing that was specifically mentioned about how he created this human persona only to essentially condemn it to death. But it's his unwillingness to confront the aliens that want to kill him is the biggie for me.  
First off, his ""merciful"" way of dealing with them was to let them starve to death, right? Yeah a slow agonizing death is so merciful. But then 6 or so (the 4 people whose bodies the Family stole, plus I think a couple others got shot? Haven't watched it in a while) completely innocent people died because the Doctor was too high and mighty to get his hands dirty taking his enemies on directly. And I feel like he definitely should have anticipated that that might happen - he had to known the Family were capable of stealing bodies like that.
And it's not like he couldn't have taken them on - he makes pretty quick work of them at the end of the episode. 

There's a little bit of this theme in the End of Time as well, when the Doctor refuses to take Wilf's gun even though killing the Master would save the entire population of Earth.

Leaving Jack behind was pretty cold as well, did he even know if Jack's teleporting thing would even work enough to get him off the station?

I really hope our fans don't shit on the little guy if he does move on. He could have done so much more bullshit last season to get his way but he got on with it and had yet another stellar season.

He's 26 and he's given us 4 very good years. This is a player that could walk into almost any midfield in world football--in my opinion the only player in our squad who we can say is truly world class. You can count the number of players at his position that are better on one hand.

I will be very sad to see him leave, and he will always be one of my favorite players. But I will have a very hard time holding it against him, because his attitude has always been very good and he's worked his ass off for us.

I don't think he's a mercenary. I think he just sees his future at an even higher level, and though it may sound kind of shitty, I want him to do well.

He's gotten a lot of stick from the press and the Chelsea fans this season but I think he's really suffered from the changes of management.

He masterminded the genocide of the Silents pretty casually, turning the human race into killers without even realizing it. That's pretty dark *and* callous, if you stop to think about it.

Plus, he does things that are ultimately for the good, but are terrible in the meantime. For instance, in The God Complex, when he has to break Amy's faith in him - necessary act, but extremely painful, I'm sure. Similarly, in The Girl Who Waited, when he shuts the TARDIS doors on Future Amy and leaves it up to Rory to decide what happens. It was necessary that only one Amy could survive, and the Doctor makes those sort of decisions all the time... but to force Rory to make that choice was heartbreaking to watch. But on the other hand, he's also done stuff to help the Ponds, like the time he helped blow up a Cybership, just to punctuate a point.

So the point is, the Eleventh Doctor is plenty dark in his own right. He's outright manipulative, though he admits to it, and frequently makes decisions that must be terrible to live with.

true,Philomathematic,hartnell,Hartnell,"This. Is a very good point. The Doctor constantly is making decisions that affect so many people, and he often acts as though he has a great responsibility. In the new series, at least, that responsibility often comes from being the last of the Time Lords - a very ""with great power comes"" situation. And this responsibility is acknowledged by many of the new companions: Rose, in her rant to Mum and Mickey in The Parting of the Ways; Martha, when she speaks to the people of Earth; Donna, in Pompeii and a few other times throughout. And perhaps most poignantly, Rory in the instance the OP mentioned. It's not one of the themes that's constantly highlighted, necessarily, but there is a big sense of the Doctor having a Messiah complex, especially the 10th but certainly others as well.

Is it right, though? I can't find the exact quotation now, which leads me to believe I may be making this up, but I'm fairly sure there's a quotation somewhere that goes along the lines of ""I'm the Doctor. Want to appeal to a higher power? Well too bad, there isn't one."" Because like it or not, the Doctor *does* have the power to decide, a lot of the time - he's clever and resourceful enough to stop a lot of things from happening, and is charismatic enough to get others to help him. His decisions are sometimes questionable, but except in a few extreme cases, I think it could be argued that they're usually the correct decision.

I haven't watched enough Classic Who to speak to the matter in regards to the Classic Doctors yet, so perhaps you can help me more here. The biggest instance of the Doctor making an incontrovertible decision that I know of comes from Genesis of the Daleks, in which he's ordered to stop the Daleks from coming about, but chooses not to. It's the ""let's kill Hitler"" choice on a massive scale, and the Doctor opts not to kill. But the difference between that action and, say, ending the Time War or activating the Delta Wave is this:

In the first case, it's the decision that ""I will not do this."" In the latter case, it's the decision that ""I will not permit your action, and will act to stop anyone from going against this decision I am making."" Whether or not this distinction can fairly characterize the Doctor's attitude between Classic and New Who, I couldn't say, and again would love to hear your opinion on the matter.

One last thought - It's the Doctor's authoritarian decision making that ultimately kicks everything off, isn't it? When Ian and Barbara stumble on the TARDIS, the First Doctor actively kidnaps them, knowing full well that he cannot and will not willingly return them to their own time, for fear of what should happen. So if it hadn't been for the Doctor being so stubborn in the first place, arguably none of this would have ever happened!",0,1339129396,null,0,false,0,c4xrk0x,t3_ur0h4,t1_c4xrk0x,t1_c4xr673,null,1429094093,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Why does the Doctor get to overthrow a totalitarian scheme? I don't like totalitarianism but maybe that's how the gov't on that planet is supposed to work. It's not our right to interfere, is it? But people are suffering. They want a revolution. Is it still our right?

Is it our right as sentient beings? Or as people? Once, maybe in a fanfic or a book or a drama or a tv episode, i don't remember, somebody asked the Doctor what gave him the right. I think it was 7. He said that his friends gave him the right. When they needed his help or they believed in him to do something. That gave him the right.

But does it when it means people will die at his hand? It's a big moral dilemma. The only reason we humans love the Doctor is because he shares and upholds our values and beliefs. If an alien race, in real life, encountered this, they may think he's the devil.

Everytime you land you end up killing people or otherwise upsetting the order of things on worlds you never knew existed. You suddenly discover that your own life on Earth has and will always be under  threat from aliens and monsters, and more often than not, it's the Doctor that actually lead those monsters there.

You get kidnapped and tortured, often because *they* want to get the Doctor to react.

So thr Thursday goes well, we get our set up running smoothly, ironing out the kinks we discovered during trading Wednesday, and make a bit of money. Everyone's happy. I finish work at about 3am and toddle off to a chai shop for a jazz fag and a cup of tea. 

I wake up on friday, and to my horror there is a puddle of water in my tent, my sleeping bag was damp and it was cold. This did not bode well for me. so getting up I wander across to the stall where I was working, trekking through the mud to get there on time. there is  a puddle in front of the stall but I think nothing of it. I go round the back to find the back of the stall, literally balls deep in a combination of mud and water and *other* things.

Half of our equipment was floating away so I grabbed all that up, we organised a digger and a ""sucker"" to get rid of the water and we were able to get trading by 2pm - we sold more than any of our other stalls that day.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;So many words. Sooo many words. Doesn't change anything though. 

Keep telling yourself that.

&gt;People make the claim that ""The Royal family bring in tourism"" The burden of proof is therefore on them and not on me.

Provided. It's up to you to either disprove it or provide evidence of your own. You have done neither.

&gt;You have provided one link

Which appears to be all it takes.

&gt;Which does nothing to satisfy me and you can't explain why it should.

Only acknowledging the replies you can answer and reverting to earlier arguments that have already been addressed tends to do that. You've given yourself the task of seperating the popularity of the royals from the sites they're associated with, because you want to illustrate that they make no difference. That's why, without any links to support your assertion, you're making 'claims' that try to sidestep surveys and statistics. Do you really think, for instance, that no commonwealth/ foreign visitors were over here for the Jubilee? That's the level of popularity (and the $ that comes with it) that you're arguing against.

&gt;You obviously hoped I wouldn't read it and even tried to sneak a lie in (The Queen is the most popular postcard tourists sent home) hoping I wouldn't notice.

Sure, and my analogies that mirror yours are fine when you do them, distractionary when I do the same. But hey, my position is so desperately weak compared to yours that I'd do that, wouldn't I? Anyone would think I'd set up a seperate thread to get *others* to do the googling I can't be bothered to do myself....oh, you beat me to it. Are you actually reading what you're typing, or are you just digging that hole so fast you don't notice? For example - the Queen's postcard being third or first doesn't really matter - it demonstrates that the Queen *herself* is a draw, not just the royal sites, which goes against what you were originally saying. But you haven't noticed that, because you're too busy scoring what you seem to think are legitimate points (but are actually quite pathetic).

&gt;Even though I'm not making any claim at all, and therefore have no burden of proof

Really? Despite arguing continually from a position of asserting that the royals make no difference to site revenue?

&gt;I provided one link (from the guardian) which proves Royal attractions are totally dwarfed by non-royal ones. You've totally ignored this link.

Of course I have - it has no bearing on the discussion. In fact, I asked you what the point of highlighting a top ten was and gave an analogy, and you got upset insisting that I was 'distracting' by, er, doing what you were doing. So I'll ask again - why does the position in a top ten make any difference to the royals drawing more people to their sites?

&gt;If we're taking turns with links (and we're not) it's definitely your turn now.

See what I mean? Ignore the points you can't answer, revert to earlier questions as if they're still valid. And now you're dictating whether or not you even have to provide links that actually back up what you're insisting on, because (in short) you can't find any - you do realise we're not at school, right?

&gt;I've challenged you to find other links to back up your claim and you have been unable to. 

No, you challenged me to find a link and then pretended it was irrelevant, going to some quite desperate lengths to insist on this but ultimately failing.

&gt;You then typed a massive,

So now you *don't* want replies to your questions?

&gt;tedious 

Well, you do keep pointing out the same things as if they're still valid when you don't like the answers. That's the problem with trying to make facts fit your predetermined opinion.

&gt;and irrelevant post 

Of course it is. So irrelevant that you're been trying to pick it apart (and failing) since I posted it, and then whined that I wasn't prepared to google more results for you. Again, we are not at school.

&gt;which must have taken ages to write 

Well, I'm at work - I get paid either way.

&gt;and would have taken me a long time to read if I'd bothered

Yes, reading does indeed seem to be difficult for you what with the repetition you engage in. And despite this, you still apparently think it's a good idea to carry on arguing from your invalidated opinion. And stating so on a public board. Amazing.

&gt;So let me ask you a very simple question that I'd like answered.

&gt; This research has been endorsed by a range of senior academics and church leaders – from Justin Welby, the new Bishop of Durham, to Archbishop Vincent Nicholls, head of the Roman Catholic Church.

Seems legit!

I'm not going to downvote the submission though.  Solely so we can all have a good laugh.

The discrepancy/additional liability may be just or unjust, but it effectively punishes part of the overall tax-base for the benefit of another part.  You can argue all taxation is theft, as libertarians do, but what's noticeable in our system is that the thief keeps returning to the same people to steal from, and they aren't the people most able to stand the loss.  Indeed, if you view the system in terms of the totality of inputs and outputs it is very much geared towards upwards redistribution.

Mind you in practice I see that it raises money for the government and the reason behind it (theoretically increasing social mobility, downwards for the rich) - for me it would make more sense that the threshhold be kept the same, but applied to the person inheriting, rather than the estate of the deceased.

Can I offer you [InterTuesday](http://www.facebook.com/groups/intertuesday/) if you do come? Ever week, there is an international's meet up close to the city centre, and is great for getting settled or just getting advice!

Enter the [group on facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/intertuesday/) and ask any question you need there =) They are a friendly helpful bunch and I'm sure you'll find some nice Swedish folks in there too! =D They also frequently share jobs on the wall - so keep your eyes on it! If you are looking for a job ASAP please contact [Lynn Recruitment](http://www.lynnrecruitment.co.uk/home.asp?pid=197&amp;area=1) I walk past there all the time and they ALWAYS have bilingual jobs on the go!

As for Vegan food, we also have the [Belfast Veg-Head's group on facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/thebelfastvegheads/) which is great for advice on on where to buy and what deals are good! We have Tesco's and Asda (VERY large supermarkets) doing well priced Vegan options these days, but there's also some nice small proprietors! There's a nice place called [The Nutmeg](http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/the-nutmeg-belfast) in the city centre which will be handy as you'll probably end up there or close to for work! Alternatively, we also have a second close to the city shop called [EatWell](http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/eatwell-foods-belfast) which also does very yummy food and is REALLY helpful for cooking etc! Both stores have a hot bar if you wanna grab a nice lunch someday!

Finally, there is a nice cafe, [Giros](http://uk.travel.yahoo.com/belfast/restaurants/giros-vegetarianvegan-cafe/), that opens on a [Saturday morning](http://www.happycow.net/reviews.php?id=30010) in the city centre as well which is another good resource for good food and meeting other vegans who can point out more places, or even just to make new friends =D

Hope all that helps! And if you need any other info please don't hesitate to PM me! &amp; Of course I'd be happy to take you out for a beer upon arrival to help you get settled! =)

In order to pay off his debts he must act only in their adverts, his soul rent and destroyed with every ""BOG-OFF"" and special offer he must intone wildly into the camera. 

He is made to wear the same outfit at all times, earning him the nickname of 'Queer Eric' at his local.

Every night he drinks and drugs himself into oblivion as he watches from the bushes of the man to whom he owes so much money's house - he is drinking expensive wine with his now ex wife, his repulsive lips caressing the her hated neck as she laughs, wine spilling from her glass as they roll on the floor in tender, vile embrace. The wine glass rolls across the cream carpet, trailing dark red vino, forgotten.

In the small hours he sits catatonic in his bedsit, dreaming of the day when he can wrap his fingers around the cold metal of a gun,

""Everything must go"" he whispers, downing the last of the whiskey, scenes of intimate slaughter flickering in his mind's eye like an old-fashioned cinema reel. 

The weapon balks in his hands and he cackles madly screaming,

**""YOU BUY ONE, YOU GET ONE FREE! I SAID YOU BUY ONE, YOU GET ONE FREE!""**

Finally he would stand alone amidst broken bodies and smashed French Windows, smiling at the chaos he wrought upon those he hates so much. 

He would turn the barrel of the weapon upon himself, and his last kiss would be loud and deadly.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;I'm stating exactly what I stated.

Righto, no confirmation apparently needed then, despite being asked.

You're stating;

&gt;the argument that we shouldn't deconstruct the monarchy because it will hurt the economy is certainly exaggerated and likely disingenuous.

Which suggests that the monarchy make no difference to the numbers that visit. While it's daft to suggest that all these visitors are only visiting the UK because of the royals, it's also daft to then infer that the royals themselves are not part of the attraction to these sites for tourists at all.

&gt;You are claiming that some fuzzy 'large number' of tourists come specifically because we have a monarchy

No, actually, I'm not. I'm saying a large number of tourists come here, they like the royal family, and in a lot of cases will make specific visits to sites like BP that they might not make if BP wasn't a working palace with troops, etc. And in any case, the numbers aren't fuzzy, they're [easily looked up](http://media.visitbritain.com/News-Releases/Monarchy-brings-in-500-million-a-year-from-foreign-tourists-says-VisitBritain-research-5d2.aspx), and they're a bit larger than what linux/ OSX desktop users consider 'large'. I'm highlighting that the royals are very popular here and abroad, and we have more visitors to those sites as a result. If you're going to assert that this isn't so, or that removing the royal connection would make no difference to visitors, you then have to demonstrate how their popularity has no connection to sales via some evidence of your own, otherwise you're ignoring key factors in favour of a pre-determined opinion.

&gt;You need evidence showing that these people (a proportion of the ~33% of tourists on holiday) wouldn't still come for some other reason.

Oh, they may well still visit the UK - but they won't be as drawn to the royal sites if there are no royals there. If you want evidence to back this up, that link mentions a poll of 25,000 where postcards of The Queen was the third most popular choice for tourists to send home. Now you have to illustrate how that popularity translates *in no way* to sales/ sites visited.

And don't forget, it's not as if people could go and see the Trooping the Colour at Buckingham Palace, because there's no need for guards if there's no Queen to guard. And even if they remained, there would no doubt be people complaining about how many hospitals could be built with the money those guards cost (etc.) - there are a lot of royal-associated things like this (Beefeaters at the Tower is another example) who wouldn't be needed with no Royals, or whose existence/ cost would be questioned. It isn't as if you can take the royals away and everything would carry on as before.

&gt;Discontinuing the monarchy doesn't negate the fact that Britain would have a rich heritage and still be an attractive place for tourism.

Yes it would, but you'd have to show that the lack of a royal connection wouldn't change sales for this approach to be anything other than speculation.",0,1339162587,null,0,1339162873,0,c4xvmip,t3_uoyzf,t1_c4xvmip,t1_c4xvdgj,null,1429096070,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;Some other networks are cutting back on data and internet allowances, but we’ve worked hard to get The One Plan right. We want you to really make the most your smartphone’s functionality, so we’re encouraging you to tether as much as you need to – without worrying about the cost.

This is where I got all excited and just assumed they meant SIM only PAYG customers too.

What's happening now is during 3-12pm if I tether at all speeds are reduced to around 50Kbps (u/l varies wildly though) on a daily basis instead of the week long punishment... Seems they're fine with tethering outside of these times, for the time being that is anyway.

By over throwing governements and by scaring off armies and by appearing to play God. I get the feeling that even if he was actively trying to not play God, to humans and lesser advanced races it would appear that he was simply because he is so much older and more advanced than that species.

To me it was also very obvious that the people that were fighting against the doctor were terrorfied/in awe of him, maybe not the leadership at the top, but the average soldier was.

Utter speculation based on nothing.

If you read my other post you will know what [I think about the visitbritain link](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/uoyzf/can_anyone_actually_prove_the_claim_that_the/c4xdyx7). The article doesn't make it clear how they came to 500 million. They are also conflating historically significant sites and the actual 'ruling' monarch, so the article makes no case regarding the actual monarchy being a draw for tourism that wouldn't come otherwise.

&gt; Oh, they may well still visit the UK - but they won't be as drawn to the royal sites if there are no royals there.

More speculation based on nothing. Prove this please. Regarding Buckingham Palace, people can only visit inside when there are no royals! The Tower of London is the most popular royal attraction (only the 14th most popular tourist attraction in the UK which is a damning statistic in itself), yet the attraction has no royal residence.

&gt; If you want evidence to back this up, that link mentions a poll of 25,000 where postcards of The Queen was the third most popular choice for tourists to send home.

The data has been spun. I covered this in the post I linked you to but if you didn't read it, a more honest way of looking at the data is that only 10% picked the queen. 10%! 90% chose something different: the red bus and castles where chosen ahead of the queen. If anyone is bending evidence to fit a predetermined opinion it is you and visitbritain.

&gt; Now you have to illustrate how that popularity translates in no way to sales/ sites visited.

No, you have to illustrate that the sales/sites visited wouldn't have happened without a ruling monarch. My position is that the monarchist pro-tourism argument is vastly over stated.

&gt; Yes it would, but you'd have to show that the lack of a royal connection wouldn't change sales for this approach to be anything other than speculation.

I don't think you know how reasoned discourse plays out. You are asking me to prove a negative; the burden of proof lies with the monarchists saying that a ruling monarch is essential to tourism: ""we can't get rid of the monarchy because it is so important to tourism"" - that is how the argument goes. The burden of proof is on them to conclusively show how this is the case.

Frankly I don't care about economics. I would be happy to take a hit on tourism should it mean we can have a more equal society in terms of law, power, influence, wealth, land, and so on. However, proponents of the monarchy greatly over-egg the importance the actual monarchy has on the economy.

Midnight would have the most appeal to the widest variety of people. It would show off the show and get people interested who wouldn't normally be interested. And David Tennant is hot. The only bad thing is the lack of TARDIS, so it doesn't describe the show as perfectly as some episodes. (first choice)

I fear emotional episodes might loose their emotion because it is a classroom at the end of the year and kids wont focus. But if you are going emotional Girl in the Fireplace would be the best bet. I would go emotion if you think your class can handle it, especially if it is girl heavy. The emotion would be unexpected, so it would work even better. Also, David Tennant on a white horse (second choice)

Blink is just fantastic... but there isn't enough doctorness in it. It also has some of the best writing. Everyone would like it, but some would like it way more than others. I'm afraid the scariness would be laughed off with the crowed. And, again, David Tennant is hot. (third choice)

These are some pros and cons about the top episodes... I hope this comment isn't too late!

read the fifa rule book.

**Law 12**

&gt;**a free-kick or penalty will be awarded if a player ""handles the ball deliberately (except for the goalkeeper within his own penalty area)""**

that means it's a foul. a player can choose to handball, knowing that there will be a punishment of a free kick or penalty. 

**Page 67 (additional information for referees)**

&gt;**""Referees are reminded that deliberately handling the ball is normally punished only by a direct free-kick or penalty kick if the offence occurred inside the penalty area.**

&gt;**""A caution or dismissal is not normally required.""**

that means referees don't even have to give a red card ... they do (it seems to be common practice, which i agree with) but isn't actually required.

so, your term ""illegal"" is wrong. according to fifa's own rules, a handball is merely a foul ... a player can choose to handball just as they might choose to concede any other foul (disadvantaging themselves, but advantaging the team). AND referees are not required to card a player for handballs ... even in the penalty area.

I definitely like all the other episodes mentioned, but I think that ""Blink"" in particular requires you to understand the backstory the least, while giving a concentrated dose of many of the great themes of the series.  As an adult, ""Blink"" is one of the few genuinely frightening Doctor Who episodes.  Because it features one-time characters, you really don't have any idea what will happen to them.  It contains none of the moralizing tone of some of the other episodes, nor the complex emotions tied to the longer story arcs of the Doctor and his companion(s), nor the characteristic sci-fi elements like the technology of the Tardis, etc.  It's just a really great horror story with some time paradox stuff in it.",0,1339171040,null,0,false,0,c4xxd4b,t3_uqp0v,t1_c4xxd4b,t3_uqp0v,null,1429096890,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

He played 7 matches since his return from the African Nations Cup, out of 15. (I'm counting from the first match after his return, which is 25th Feb) That's not incredibly impressive, but doesn't symbolise someone who can't get into the first team. 

Until you realise that he played all of those 7 matches as a substitute. 

25th Feb. Aston Villa (A) Diame 79'
3rd Mar Swansea (H) Diame 46'
11th Mar Norwich (A) Diame 86'

11th April Man Utd (H) Diame 70'
16th April Arsenal (A) 86'. 

I wouldn't say that 113 total minutes played in 7 matches over 3 months is a very good tally, but I do see how his goals to minutes played ratio isn't too shabby. Also, Senegal was knocked out of the African Nations Cup during the group stage, so while he did miss some matches, it was surely less than many other African players. I suppose it did take some toll on him though, because while Senegal's last match in the African Nations Cup was on the 29th of January, his return game for Wigan didn't happen until 25th February.

true,FoundJudas,null,null,"Skipping tends to be very localised in how easy it is.  For around a year I had an unspoken deal with a housemate whereby he'd buy anything that I was unable to skip and that worked very well because I was one of very few people doing it in my area.  New people came in, started taking the mick and leaving a mess and the shop very quickly started locking the bins with a triangle key.

In my experience the smaller shops tend to be best, the larger ones will do more to lock their bins and/or use a compactor.  I used to frequent the big out-of-town supermarket for skipping, largely on the off-chance because it was next to an electronics store which frequently had easily-fixable things.  Only once did the big supermarket accidentally leave things unlocked, but by the time I'd gone home to round up the troops they'd realised their mistake - and it needed at least three people to carry all the stuff.

It's usually not a good idea to take everything, only what you (or your crew) need.  That way others will (hopefully) do the same.  If the other people in the area are dicks and leave the bins in a mess then it pays to tidy up after them, but at some point you just give up and go find new pastures.

Small wholesalers are good if there's one in your area, especially the ones that deal with fancy restaurants.  Things will be fresher and may come in larger quantities - we'd frequently make tomato soup for the entire street after a particularly good haul.

Skipping residential properties is never worth it, but you will occasionally spot furniture and discarded bikes on the streetside - especially in university areas at the end of the academic year.  In my area the cafes and restaurants weren't usually worth skipping, but in other areas I've visited you could live off sandwiches from certain stores.

If you're at university then start taking notice of when they have big meetings as there will frequently be leftovers to take away.  And many university groups have free food at events, particularly the religious ones.

You'll soon get the hang of which days and times are good for skipping.  Sunday just before midnight used to be good for main the shop I'd frequent, I'd make trips to other locations during the week - mostly as an excuse for a bike-ride out somewhere.

Finally, always reject packages which are bulging.  For one they're likely to explode in you bag, but more importantly it means the food inside has gone off.

Oh and [Free: Adventures on the margins of a wasteful society](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0091932734/) is a good book about one person's experiment in squatting, skipping and generally living for free.

It's different from when Ecclestone changed to Tennant, because you don't have the other characters bringing the previous Doctor through.

To use your person analogy, if you are afraid of ""people"" (not a specific person, just people generally) it would show you a hologram of a person.

He's a conglomerate of romantic ideals: Charm, Impulse, Adventure, Compassion, etc, etc. And emotions are not always discreet, so Friendship, Companionship, Physical Attraction and the Soulmate bullshit can get muddied at the best of times for the dumb, wise, young and old alike. 

It's all about nuance. A writer deftly sorting those feelings out on-screen and having characters develop and grow is doing his job well. That sort of thing inherently latches on to our empathy receptors and draws us into the story. You can also beat that horse to death and it can become a real turn-off. The smart writer is going to take care and try and balance and harmonize the emotional notes he hits. The Doctor and his companions is a tough gig, because it's got to be the same, but different.

Now that doesn't really make the immature, eternal-commitment, wanna-have-ur-babies thing any less tiresome, but to Jack and Amy's benefit I'd say that wanting to have sex with the charming enigma wouldn't necessarily lump them in with that kind of rabid. River is such a self-realized, established force of nature- as much a mystery as the Doctor- that she's somewhat exempt.

He can't encapsulate every one of those things majestically or else he wouldn't be different with ever regeneration.  

I realize that the companions are chosen based on their chemistry with the Doctor's then-current regeneration, but chemistry doesn't have to lead to romantic feelings (see Donna).  I just don't think Moffat is stretching his legs as far as he can with this.  I feel RTD took more risks with certain things, but Moffat's just taking the audience reaction and fulfilling our wishes.  I would love to see him take a chance with either an alien companion or a male compaion just to see him challenge himself more.  I mean, let's face it, we all saw River's ""twist"" a mile away.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans/companions along with him to see alien worlds and history. We've had approximately 784 episodes (32 seasons) but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in nearly anywhere.

The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a you will like. 

Don't like the eleventh Doctor? Try the tenth! Also, Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 (seasons 1-26) then relaunched in 2005 (seasons 27-32/series 1-6).

But by no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv). You should choose the 2005 point.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

And no matter what you do, watch all six series. And if you like them, there's always classic who... :D",0,1339179320,null,0,false,0,c4xzh4z,t3_ureen,t1_c4xzh4z,t3_ureen,null,1429097883,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

If you're worried about being arrested for wasting police time, dont be. You've got to try _really_ hard to do that, like phoning in a hoax bomb threat. An honest mistake merits a shrug and forgetting about.

true,[deleted],null,null,"To add to what people have already said. I found there are 2 options at this point:

You could start with Series 1 (2005) and watch everything from there. That's what I did, that's what a lot of people are doing, too. The problem I have with this (well not me personally but when introducing friends to the show) is that some of the episodes are a bit silly and if you're not a fan of sci-fi to start with this might put you off. I remember seeing a list on here a couple of months ago with episodes one could 'skip' when doing a first viewing of the show.

The other option, works well if you have a friend who can help you with some minor details you might be missing, is to start with series 5. Doctor Who is set up in a way that the main character (the Doctor) regenerates when he dies and becomes a completely new character. He keeps his memories and everything but it usually changes his temper, his sense of humour and just his personality as a whole. Series 5 starts with introducing a new 'version' of the Doctor along with a new companion so it's a great jumping point. Series 5 and 6 being more recent, they're also easier to get into. Not only does the show look better (special effects and whatnot) I feel like there are less 'silly' episodes.

If you decide to watch Series 5 first, you might have to ask your friend to explain to you a bit of the Doctor's back story although there's a lot of the previous stories explained to Amy (his new companion) so in a way you're not missing much. I know this might not be a really popular way of doing things around here but I found it to work well when I introduced my girlfriend to the show. She had never seen any sci-fi in her life but she really enjoyed series 5 and 6 and we were done she had acquired a taste for more Doctor Who so we were able to go back and watch the previous series. Her pre-existing ideas about what the show was helped getting through some of the silly episodes.

No matter what you do, this show is incredible and always worth watching. Series 1 and 2 have their cheesy moments but if you keep an opened mind you'll soon realise that it's all part of a much bigger plan.

It'd mean that we probably lost Van der Vaart or Bale. Dempsey's good, but not as good as Van der Vaart, and they're both the same age. I don't think Fulham are going to let go of Dempsey for less 10m euros, and I honestly don't think Dempsey is worth that much, considering the almost nonexistent resale value. And then there's the issue of his position. Our wingers act as suppliers, first and foremost, and both are tricky, pacy dribblers and sprint in and throw crosses in. Dempsey seems like he cuts in much more and is more of a physical presence, and not as fast as our current wingers, so our shape wouldn't be as balanced, and if he plays centrally, I don't think he has the touch, technique, or vision that Rafa does. If we do lose a major player that Dempsey could replace, I would prefer we go with a younger player that is either entering his prime, or approaching it. I think Dempsey's peaking this year, and he'll hit 30 next year and it'll be downhill from there.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I hate to say it, because I do it myself with Venezuelan players more often than I should, but it definitely is the bias speaking. I've watched VdV a lot more this season, granted, but from what I've seen, Dempsey's a much more physical player than Rafa, and he likes to rush into the box and scores a lot of scrappy and headed goals, and we've scored very few of those last season, we almost always played it along the ground, which is where our strength lies, with players like Rafa, Adebayor, and Modric. Not only that, but Dempsey's strengths will fade once he hits 30, and I haven't really seen much technical ability to show me that he'll be able to adjust his playstyle to continue playing at that level. Meanwhile, athleticism is probably the weakest part of VdV's game. He has probably the best first touch on the team, and he can play pinpoint cross-field passes like a boss. I wouldn't be surprised to see him take up a more deep-lying role in the future. And Dempsey is just as capable of disappearing in games as every other player. Off the top of my head, the losses the Swansea and Wolverhampton this past season were particularly bad performances, and he didn't impress much against Canada either. 

Most of that was based off feeling though, I looked through some numbers to confirm, and while he does have 6 more goals than Rafa this season, he also did it in 9 more games and had fewer assists. Dempsey's given the ball away about twice as much as VdV, and his passing stats pale in comparison as well. VdV's completed more passes than Dempsey has attempted despite playing 6 fewer games, and has completed more than twice as many crosses, through balls and long balls than Dempsey has even attempted, again, in 6 fewer games, and he's created 20 more goalscoring opportunities as well.

I know this sounds like I'm trashing Dempsey, and I'm really not, I like him as a player, but I'm trying to be as unbiased as possible. He performs a role, and he does it well. That role is not the same role Van der Vaart does, and trying to plug him into that role would be a disaster.

There are about a dozen books and it's still going, with plenty more to come. I really enjoy the series; it's a bit reminiscent of the old *World of Darkness* for those with tabletop RPG backgrounds, in a good way, and taking myths and traditions from various sources around the world.

Butcher's *Codex Alera* is a more traditional fantasy series, about a half dozen-ish books long. I started the first book and then got slapped with school, and ended up reading *A Song of Ice and Fire* instead...I'll have to get back to Alera sometime, there's a Rome-esque quality about the setting that's really neat.

They were outside Hitchen on the East coast mainline, They were installers not track maintenance and they were in a green zone installing TPWS. (This is all greek to me so hang on) There was no lookout (he kind of chuckled at that point so I guess that is unusual or he was just remembering the event) and they were mainly bunched up behind a 'loc' box with the victim working on it the rest presumably 'offering helpful advice'. I think he said that another guy working on a 'dis' box shouted as the train went by (about the gusher) and for some reason instead of keeping behind the 'loc' box with the rest of the crew the victim popped his head around the side of the box to see what was being shouted about and caught the face/beardfull. (he did have his hands full and couldn't immediately sort himself out)

The up the embankment stuff and warnings I must have put in from remembering him talking about the general safety stuff on the tracks, other stories about avoiding gushers etc. 

Another story I half remember him talking about was someone working near/about Kings Cross with their back to the track and standing up just to have a coasting engine brush his back on a stretch of track that had been cleared safe followed by a search to twat the man who had cleared the track as safe. I'm not sure if that was him, a crewmate or someone else from his depot.

He had some good stories including someone he worked with losing his rag with a high up Tyne and Wear Metro safety guy along the lines of (during an overly long boring talk/induction) 'Look, I don't give a fuck if you call it the countries 3rd biggest rail system it's just a glorified fucking tram... sign our bloody paperwork and let us go'

As for vegans, you should have no issue. There are normally vegetarian/vegan options in menus in most restaurants and fast food outlets. A friend of mine is a vegan and he seems to get what he needs from the local shops and fast food outlets. 

If by ""shoot the shit"", you mean to get drunk, I'm sure you'd find groups of work colleagues to drink with on Friday nights!

true,WhyAmINotStudying,null,null,"I don't know if I agree with that sentiment. There was a pretty steady decrease in age and increase in action from the first Doctor to the fifth Doctor. Hartnell was an old man who had an action lead male who took that role, then Troughton was a bit younger, yet still had his action lead male. When Pertwee came around, the Doctor was a bit younger, but now took the reigns as the lead action male, and Tom Baker continued the trend. He stayed on the show far longer, so he simply became older, making him more like the older males from the earlier series, but he started off as more of a ""let's experience and adventure"" kind of Doctor.

Peter Davison took the role more as an older brother who is visiting home from Cambridge sort of feel, and the complimentary cast became much younger, too. 

But yeah, I don't think I'd say the Doctor would have been defined as a reclusive genius past the first few episodes of the entire series. Certainly by the time Troughton came along, he was far removed from that atmosphere.

If anything, the biggest change there ever was would probably have been the transition from Davison to Colin Baker. 

The contrast between 10 and 11, though... I think it's best defined by two distinct, yet complimentary behaviors:

 - The 8/9/10th Doctors had become romantic leads. 11 brought the Doctor back to being more alien and less human love interest (though Rory was a necessary element to establish that).

 - No previous Doctor had willingly accepted a family-like relationship with anyone since Susan Foreman. He may have had strong bonds with his companions, like Sarah Jane, but he never openly accepted his role with the family of any other companions. The closest would have been Rose, but he regularly expressed disdain for her mother and avoided invitations. The next closest would probably have been Donna, because of how well he got along with Wilf, but even that was sort of fleeting. 

Personally, I would have been happy if we dumped Rory, Amy, and River Song about a season earlier, because the show became more about the dynamics of those relationships than it was about science fiction and adventures. 

With that said, I don't think I'd mind a new Doctor/Peri sort of relationship to happen. I'd also like more than anything for the storyline to bring back the damned Time Lords. This ""I'm the last of my kind"" crap has run its course, and the writers can literally do whatever the hell they want to bring back *anyone*.

I think this has always been the law. If your right to remain or visa expires you have to leave the country regardless of the status of your partner. I have known people that have had to leave the country that have had partners. 


I hope they remove the birthrate citizenship status from non British parents. This is a realy big loop hole that is often exploited by immigrants to gain British citizenship. They come over on a visa and then have a child in the country. The child is then british and then they claim benefits off the socialist system. 

The socialist system creates the incentive for the wrong kind of immigration, people end up moving to the uk because of the free houses, free education, free healthcare, free money etc. They don't move to the uk for the weather or the beaches. it is just a matter of numbers, the british tax payer can not afford to support the population of the entire world, with some countries like india having 1 billion people and with modern day transportation, where 1 million people can travel through an airport in a day. The potential for over population in high density areas is especially apparent. 

Over population can lead to all sorts of problems, increases in demand due to high population push property prices up and reduce the availability of work. Foreign low skilled labour can also reduce the value of wages due to their acceptance of a lower standard of living. This in turn can reduce the standard of living of the population.

true,pcjonathan,smith,Smith,"&gt;Get over all this elitist mumbo jumbo. 

I would point out that this is not what the op is on about. While I do agree with what you say, the OP is NOT talking about Whovian vs True Whovian. They are actually on about (as an example) Whovian vs Tennant Fan Girl: where there is a difference between watching and understanding the series as a whole (including at least acknowledging there is more than one actor and preferably seeing more than one), and just watching Tennant and practically refusing to see any others, or hating them right from the start and refusing to open up to any of the others because they consider him to be the best/hot/whatever.

It's not about choosing a favorite Doctor or even loving all of them because ""they are all the same guy"". It's about people who are obsessed with the actor not the show and calling themselves ""Whovians"" because there is a connection, or thats how they got into the actor. If this is the point that the OP is trying to make then I agree. I just feel that /r/doctorwho is not the best place for it as it doesn't really apply much to the people here, at least not anymore. This is probably why some people are thinking what you are thinking.

(Of course...I could be wrong and the OP is talking complete BS about elitist...just stick with me here ;) )
