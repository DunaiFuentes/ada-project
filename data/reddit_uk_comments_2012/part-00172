Anyway, I'm a non-religious Scout leader and I've always taken issue with not being able to just say ""I am not a religious person"" whilst in uniform. When I had my appointment interview I was grilled a little bit because I left the religion box on the application form empty. We eventually agreed to write-in 'Christian' because I can still talk neutrally about religion without being religious, and to answer a child's questions about religion.

And that's how I see it - I'm an educator and an educator's job is to answer questions. I enjoy talking about religion - I think religion is a wonderful thing - and it's great when my Cubs ask me about it because they want help in understanding what it's all about. I don't have to be religious to explain to a child why they may want to be, or to discuss other religions and beliefs. In fact I think it's better that I can be neutral about it.

That said, while I welcome an atheist promise, I'm not too bothered by it. To me the promise is subjective, yet accountable. It ultimately boils down to fulfilling your potential and putting yourself on show. So long as my colleagues and Cubs see me doing my best - and I them - that is the promise kept.

Honestly, so long as you're open minded, that's all that matters. I like to think I am, and so far my Cubs haven't proven me wrong - nor I them!

true,WindyMiller,null,null,"Electricians have nothing to do with this. That's sort of how analogies work. The point of it was that you were criticizing the NSS for, as you put it, offering nothing but complaints. But that's what its members want from it! They have complaints, and they think those complaints are important. The NSS allows them to make those complaints collectively, and therefore more forcefully. What's wrong with that?

A closer analogy might be: it's like criticizing a supper club for doing nothing but eat. The fact that the club is all about food doesn't mean that its members are gluttons.

On that basis, it seems ridiculous to criticize the NSS for complaining. But if you're criticizing its membership, then you're assuming that the members of the NSS 'offer nothing but complaints'. That's nonsense.

&gt;I don't think its unreasonable... to ask if the opinions of millions of members count more than a tiny group of 7,000 odd (wikipedia estimate) griping.

You didn't ask this - and rightly so, because nobody has suggested that the NSS should have more say in TSA policy than TSA members. You asserted that TSA has a right to make its own policies, which I agree with, and you implied that the NSS were only complaining because they're too lazy to be a youth organization instead, which seems absurd to me.

I just don't understand what your complaint is. You seem to think that campaigning organizations are a bad thing, but I don't see how you could have arrived at that position - especially as you presumably think it's the right of the NSS to set its own priorities, just as it's the right of TSA to set its own policies around religion.

Mikel and Oscar would play in the pivot with Oscar playing on the left side, slighty higher up the pitch. Ramires would play LW but tuck in to support the midfield by winning balls for Oscar. The combination of Oscar and Ramires pressing would allow to be effective and putting pressure on teams. Although Ramires can't cross on as well from the left, his support will allow Ashley Cole to push up and bit and do what he does best without exposing us. 

Hazard will play on the right with Mata going back to middle forming a still fluid, yet slightly less complicated attacking trio up front. 

If we need an attacking sub Moses or Marin comes on for Ramires. If we need a defensive sub then Ramires comes back to CM and Oscar comes off for Bertrand, or Romeu on for Oscar.

&gt; Torres is defending corners well!

Great, we have a £50 million striker who can defend corners really well. We also have three 6 foot 2 defenders who can defend corners and don't fall over constantly.

&gt; Torres is scoring in training!

I would hope so. He's been here 2 years. Was he not scoring in training under RDM, AVB, and Carlo? Thank you for the great news Rafa, that our striker is scoring goals at Cobham.

&gt; ""But still we must create better chances for him.""

I'd say bringing in Oscar, Hazard, and not signing another striker in the summer secured Torres an opportunity to score all season. We've given him the tools, he's getting the service, what the fuck man?

&gt; ""Torres is an important player but we need goals from other players too.""

Our top scorer is Mata. Not that I'm complaining, I want that dude to be the captain some day. Seriously though, does Benitez have his head in his ass? Torres is our striker, our only striker. We need goals from him. Nobody cares if he's great at defending corners and clearing the ball. People care that he puts the ball in the back of the net. It. Is. His. Job.

This whole row is making me sick. The optics of hiring Torres' ex-manager was shit to begin with. Not to mention we've scored 2 goals in our last five games, and Torres hasn't scored in two months. We're trying to salvage a £50 million investment and it isn't working.

Bring in Falcao, bring in that guy from Vitesse (Kony?), bring in Schurrle, or Muniain, or Huntelaar, or Soldado, or just buy five young twenty something strikers and try them all out in rotation.

He doesn't say he's romantically or physically attracted to her -.- Yeah he doesn't exclude it either, but his point is obviously that the Doctor chooses people he finds interesting and/or appealing. If you re-watch series 5 it's repeatedly made clear that the Doctor was 'attracted' to Amelia Pond, but it wasn't sexual or romantic (it was how brave she was even though she was the only Scottish girl in an English village with a crack in the universe in her wall).

Furthermore, having a Doctor/Companion romance would be a total departure from the tone Smith and Moffat have been setting for the 11th so far, imo.

true,Silent_Ranger,null,null,"Overall I think it is a good idea, one of the big reasons why the English national team is so far behind it's league is because the players don't go abroad - they only learn one style of play which hinders development.

As far as quality I've noticed an unfair and unrealistic bias in favor of English clubs. At the moment there are only 2 top quality teams in England, in Spain there are 4, Germany there are 3, Italy there are 2. Where would you rather see a young player like Sterling play off the bench at Villa or starting for a team like Betis? 

Fact of the matter is in Spain in particular (which is where I'm assuming we would be sending these kids) is incredibly competitive after Barcelona and Madrid, also they play a more tactical, team-positioning based game which is very similar to the way Rodgers is looking to play moving forward. One of the reasons why so many players coming from Spain are successful in the prem is because they learn better tactics in Spain than they would in England (which has a greater emphasis on one-on-one battles) and then learn to exploit physical spaces better by coming to England - a great example of this is David Silva.

This being the case I think Spain would be a fantastic place to send young kids on loan to learn the strategic side of the game (Sterling in particular would really benefit from this if he wasn't already a first-team player). Having said this there is the language and cultural barrier that must be overcome which would be a hindrance to the British academy kids. However if we continue with this theme of Spanish and South American players at Liverpool then this barrier is greatly diminished.

My last point would be that for young players to get to play regularly anywhere is of immense benefit because the U21 team AKA ""The reserves"" is in a crap league because England doesn't care about youth development. They could really learn from Spain who have ""B"" teams for the academies of larger clubs. Think of the possibilities of having a Liverpool B team in the championship, the kids would get to play Liverpool style football while all on the same team together so they would build that understanding that is so vital while playing against opposition that would raise their game, and at any time they could be called up to the first team to play in a cup game or Europa league or whatever.",0,1354642624,null,0,1354643139,0,c7b3yw9,t3_146x6d,t1_c7b3yw9,t3_146x6d,null,1435661933,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

The Association will be stronger if these rules change, because it will no longer be telling large numbers of its supporters that they aren't worth as much simply because they aren't religious.

It doesn't mean she shouldn't hold office, and given that he knew that if she stayed in office it would have ushered in a new golden age, I think he was just acting out of spite.

3) Yeah, but especially at the beginning he was sending her a ton of mixed signals, that's the issue.

4) They were going to die without hosts - they have very short lifespans.  He could have just kept them trapped outside their bodies and let them pass on.  Eternal torture is a dick move, sorry, no matter what you've done.

5) Yes, and part of the reason he chose not to travel with the Doctor was because he was a dick about it.  In *Utopia* he flat out tells Jack that he's ""wrong"", that he shouldn't be, that he can't even stand to look at him.  Yeah, Jack takes it pretty well, but that's gotta hurt - he looks up to the Doctor, has modeled his life around him, goes through unspeakable tortures for him, has waited for him for literally a century, just to be told that he's a cosmic mistake that should never have been.  It's like if your mom flat out told you she should have had an abortion.  It's hurtful, and it's the sort of thing that seriously wounds the relationship between them - I think that Jack would never have felt comfortable traveling with him after that.  Would you rather be in a place where you were barely tolerated, or in a place where you were loved and respected? 
6) No, he says that they are about to close, they'll still close whichever side she's on.  And 10.5 did nothing worse than what 10 did, plus he's less powerful - he doesn't have a TARDIS, he can't regenerate, and he'll eventually die.  There's no reason that they had to go into Pete's Universe instead of staying at home.
7) This one, yeah, he says that it can't be fixed.  But I still think that he could have tried - put her in cryogenic storage until he worked out a solution, maybe.  I think that he was just feeling so depressed because of his conversation with Davros that he just felt that it would have been futile, so he didn't even try.

Royal Blenheim also, great landlord, nice pub, a lot more central - and they've always got a good number of ales on.

Far From the Madding Crowd is probably my favourite ale pub in central Oxford - they've do a manager's special, which is usually pretty decent, and a good bargain.

Other good pubs to try are the Royal Oak (not so much for the ale but for the ambiance), the Turf (clichéd and busy, but do serve a good pint), and the King's Arms isn't too bad either - perfect if you've got a big group going.

The Fir Tree, on Iffley Road is worth a mention as a good ale pub, though it is very small.

Finally, always worth a mention, the wetherspoons on george street (the four candles) is actually pretty decent - like all other spoons, they serve their beers a little too cold, and the atmosphere lacks the warmth of any of the other pubs I've mentioned, but as far as these places go, it's not too bad, and they've always got a good selection, and something for everyone...",0,1354646099,null,0,false,0,c7b52bj,t3_149knf,t1_c7b52bj,t3_149knf,null,1430576257,4,false,oxford,t5_2rc7b,4

*When once considers the extremely low turnout to the fact that *over 60,000 NHS employees* throughout the South West of England are facing attacks on their working conditions as a result of the creation of the South West Pay, Terms and Conditions Consortium, whose aim is to reduce wages, increase working hours, introduce performance-based pay, cut unsocial-hours and provisions for sick-leave and annual holidays. One has to question why have the unions completely failed to mobilise their membership. This is a political issue.

*Despite Unite claiming to be a ""fightback"" union, as the article states, this very low turnout demonstrates that such claims carry ""little weight among health workers who have drawn lessons from the years of inaction and systematic betrayal of their struggles and “give-backs” to management over wages and conditions."" This is a political issue.

*As one demonstrator told the WSWS ""“This march is going to do nothing."" This is a political issue.

*Article also outlines that the that""demagogy was liberally deployed to conceal inaction"" of the trade unions. The inaction of the unions and there attempt to cover this with ""demagogy"" is a political issue.

*The unions fruitless campaign to ""“persuade trusts to pull out of the cartel”  and ""“supporting those four trusts that never joined.” Is a political campaign being conducted by the unions and therefore is a political issue.

*When the International officer of UNISON Central Health Branch, publicly promotes Dave Prentice, the general secretary of Unison, as the man to take the fight forward to the employers and utterly refuses to take into consideration his role of ""presiding over the cuts as a non-executive director of the Bank of England."" This is not just political deception but also a political issue.

This is not just ""sniping at the unions"" but raising serious questions regarding the political character and perspective of the trade union bureaucracy.

**But it wasn't.** It was published under her own name. A name attached to one of the biggest selling book series in the history of publishing.

Is it a boring book? Yes. It's significantly better written than the Potter books, but unlike those books - which are full of wonder and enjoyment, here Rowling used her writing to tell a story that was just plain dull.

Nowhere did I see that was a for certain thing. As I recall it was merely popular opinion. He didn’t do it out of spite, he did because she threatened him and this has larger implications than you’ve stopped to consider. The threat also ran a lot deeper than I think you realize.

3. The doctor, all of them, have a flirty flirty personality. That doesn't mean ""get attached to me"" as a woman, you should know this. He acted that way with everyone. Male and female alike. I will agree about the dickish things he constantly said comparing her to Rose, but i think he was doing that so she WOULDN'T fall for him. You can see in a few episodes where he is looking at her from the back because he DOESN'T want to hurt her but he knows he has to.
4. They were never going to stop. They had been doing it for a long time. And above all else, when it came to the doctor, he did not condone murder.
5. Jack asked him to be honest. Even Jack himself, knew he was wrong. And after everything, it changed nothing. They are still old friends until the end. Even though 10 didn't know it was him, He called him ""my oldest friend"" and he didn't want him to die.
6. Rose couldn't stay. And the doctor was in love with her as well. But he wouldn't grow old, he wouldn't die. Rose however would. Rather than killing his clone, seeing as he doesn't condone murder, he left a piece of himself to grow old with Rose. He sacrificed his hearts, so Rose could be happy. He cannot be a fixed point in time.
7. He didn't just wipe her memory, pay closer attention.

If it was treated like other celebrity news - perhaps a small section toward the end of the news, small sections in (proper) newspapers etc - then no-one would be complaining. 

Certainley I doubt many people would be angry about this sort of thing if it wasn't for the massive amount of coverage of royalty - if the coverage matched the interest and was for the most part relegated to a special part of the news, like sports usually is, then most people wouldn't mind, but the coverage far exceeds the interest and is treated as if it was as important as all the other news.

It is often assumed by people who like this sort of news that those of us who are sick and tired of it must hate the royalty. Sure, some of us do, but in reality, most of us just don't give a shit, and are just tired of this being pushed in our face all of the time. Would you like it if news about something else that doesn't majorly affect your life (say movies or videogames) was treated as the most important stories? I doubt it.

For those who are interested in every little detail of the royals lives, why can't they do what every other group of people with an interest in something does and find the news yourself, on a website or magazine for precisely that sort of thing, rather than vehemantly defending the fact that it is plastered all over my TV screen for half of the news every time something vaguely related to the royal family happens?

true,JB_UK,null,null,"There are two ways that I'd answer this. First, the substantive point in Charlotte Church's story wasn't about phone hacking (she only mentioned that in passing), the substantive point was about the paper's blackmail. And that's a useful case to consider, because although it's illegal, it's just the sort of issue where it is completely impractical to say 'just apply to law'. Because it's the word of the victim against the journalist, and because the journalist can always phrase the threat with care to the legal niceties. For instance, they can say that all their fellow papers are going to publish negative stories, and the target needs to 'get their side of the story across' by giving them an exclusive.

Second, investigation in England, and hence prosecution, must always go through the police, and the police are inherently in a compromised position with regard to the press, because they (especially in the decision-making higher echelons) do not want to be portrayed negatively. If you can forgive the vanity, I posted [an exhaustive run-through of this the other day](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/143kx9/ian_hislop_why_should_i_answer_to_david_cameron/c79n9s5?context=3).

I don't think anyone seriously doubts that an independent regulator with a meaningful [code of conduct](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Complaints_Commission#The_Code_of_Practice) is necessary to redress some of these problems, particularly having a way of collect together and publish information regarding the general conduct of the press, and giving people some way to challenge stories and seriously mark their objections to press behaviour, without pursuading the police, or going through the libel courts.     

So everyone seemingly agrees that the Leveson proposals should be implemented by the press. The debate is about whether the regulator should be anchored in law, or whether you trust that the press will manage a regulator on their own with honesty and integrity. You can imagine my scepticism on this latter point. Even if a regulator goes into full force initially (which will never happen), it will certainly be neutered over time, as public interest wanes. 

I'd also say that I doubt Leveson's statutory underpinning would have any real effect on serious investigative journalism. For one thing, it never prevents publication, only deals with cases after the effect. There's no way it could be used to punish journalists for publishing something like MPs expenses, because the public uproar would be so enormous that the law would have to be relaxed immediately.

A contract is not accepted until both parties explicitly agree, this can either be done by goods changing hands or by written statement (email is ok) saying the same explicit thing (along the lines of ""Hotel Rooms Booking Acknowledged"" Accepted or Confirmation isn't strong enough wording.)

Paying money doesn't mean anything, all that means is you've explicitly accepted to enter a contract with the retailer/service provider and until they respond explicitly then no contract exists.

------------------------

The whole ""if you read it then it's fixed"" thing is complete nonsense. 

Remember Waters of Mars?  He changed history after having read it.  In fact, we watched as the words changed themselves on the page. 

True, the Doctor lies, and true, the whole ""Time Lord Victorious"" thing had a ton of negative consequences, but the fact of the matter is he CAN change things after having read them, and *even fixed points are mutable.* 

So the problem must be that the Doctor CAN'T go back and get Amy and Rory.  It's that he WON'T. 

...which strikes me as odd, because you'd think out of all the people for whom he'd be willing to break the rules, he'd do it for them. He's done it before.

true,ravniel,num11,,"I have to say I disagree.  Parker is great and his work rate is immense, but lumping Dembele and Huddlestone together as far as defensive contribution is *totally* unfair.  Huddlestone has averaged 1.4 tackles per game this season; that's not even in the Premier League top 100.  Dembele has averaged 3.5 tackles per game, 9th most in the league.  Sandro has weighed in with 3.1, 17th highest in the league.  It's not all about tackling either; look at interceptions, arguably an even more vital form of defensive work (and definitely something that's crucial closer to the box).  Huddlestone has averaged 0.8 interceptions per game.  Dembele has averaged 1.6.  Sandro averages a *league leading* 3.6 interceptions per game.

I'm listing these stats in an attempt to demonstrate two things: first of all, Dembele's defensive contribution is *far* better than Huddlestone's.  It's not even really close.  He's a terrific ball-winner and Huddlestone isn't.  Second of all, Sandro is a goddamned beast with a serious case for being the most effective defensive midfielder in the Premier League right now.  Between Dembele and Sandro we have one of the best midfield partnerships in the league - before Dembele was injured during the international break, the two of them had won possession more times than any other partnership in the league, and that's with Dembele missing our first 2.5 games.  Those two aren't the problem, they're fundamental components of our success.

I'm not saying Parker won't contribute in those areas, he certainly will.  But there is honestly very little room for improvement over Sandro and Dembele.

true,hfbs,dorset,Dorset,"A family friend of ours had an interesting theory about G4S's failure and it went something like this:

The government had planned to bring in the military from the start to provide security and peace of mind but didn't want to cause unnecessary panic so they needed a scapegoat - who better than the security firm? Now I personally don't know if it's true, but apparently, G4S were told to provide a certain number of personnel for the Olympics and dutifully did so. As the Olympics drew closer, the government then turned round and said 'actually we want loads more. Like, more than currently in your employment'. G4S replied 'well, that's ludicrous - there's no way we can provide that'. The media picked up on that and G4S were left trying to meet the raised amount of personnel while the media, in line with the government, attacked like vultures. The public lost faith in them so the government was all like 'Don't worry folks, we got this. The military has decided to step up. Hooray!', even though that was their plan from the start. As G4S hadn't really messed up, that explains why they're still getting contracts and everything.

Now, again, I personally don't know how much of the above is true, if any of it, but it's certainly another viewpoint at least. ",0,1354655596,null,0,false,0,c7b85la,t3_14952o,t1_c7b85la,t3_14952o,null,1430577841,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Tennant has done nothing but repeat over and over again that he has no information on the subject. Eccleston has been more forward.

As for Baker, the only confirmation is that he's returning. I'll give you that one, but how far can that conversation actually be taken by publications if you won't allow them rumors? They can only say ""it's awesome that he thought the show ruined his career but now he's coming back anyway"" so many times. If they took it any further than that, it's rumors again.

All I can find through Googling about The Master's appearance is a bunch of rumors about Benedict Cumberbatch playing him. I'm willing to take your word for it that Moffat confirmed the return, but if they were to talk about anything other than ""Moffat said he's coming back"", it's rumors.

For a small island, we have a hell of a lot stuffed in here!
London has to be done, but is massively touristy. You're more likely to run into another American before you meet a born &amp; bred Londoner. Allow 2-4 days.

Oxford is very nice &amp; thankfully, you can see everything you need to see, in a day.

Cambridge is nice, but much like Oxford. The highlight of a trip to Cambridge is going up the river Cam on a Punt, but is best done in summer. 1 day.

The Peak District is beautiful, but you will need a way of getting yourself between all the lovely spots as public transport won't cover them all. I may be wrong on that part though. Allow 2-4 days.

The Lake District is spectacular &amp; is great for walking &amp; hiking (as is the Peaks) and you could easily spend 2 weeks here.

Bath is very nice &amp; makes for a jumping off point for other areas such as Wales, Bristol &amp; the West Country. 2 days in Bath city centre. At least 2 weeks to see the other places I mentioned.

Cornwall is fantastic &amp; you need a week here. You *must* try a proper Pastie.

Now then, Scotland. Scotland is one of my favourite places in the world!
The east coast may be worth a visit, but personally, I don't care for it much...it's all about the west coast!
You could do a lovely long-distance walk from just out of Glasgow to Fort William (the West Highland Way - 95 miles/6 days) which covers a variety of terrain from flat meadows, to our highest mountains.  

A boat ride out to the Hebridean islands is a must. 
The Outer Hebrides are very barren, yet fantastically beautiful. A bastard to get around though if you don't have a car. 
If you *do* hire a car there, keep your wits about you, as the roads don't flow like normal, they tend to veer off at weird angles just as you go over the crest of a rise.

Seriously though, you could spend 6 months in Scotland &amp; still only scratch the surface of what it has to offer.

We have a very good public transport network, which can get you pretty much anywhere you want to go. If you are going to be travelling a lot on trains, maybe take out a second mortgage on a home or rob a bank, it can get bloody expensive!

Our national dish is a curry from a take away, a Doner Kebab or fish &amp; chips! Certain regions have certain dishes that they do better than others. You'll laugh at the name, but ""Faggots"" is a wonderful dish &amp; I think the best I have ever had, come from Shropshire or Wales.
Having a proper Black Pudding is a must eat too, as is eating Haggis in the land of the Scots.

There are some moral implications to what he did to Kazrahn that I wish were addressed. There were so many things wrong with that that it was completely outrageous.

The short answer is that people will care about this stuff *later*, don't worry. If a new showrunner takes over and actually gives a shit about continuity, people will realize how weak Moffat was with it. For now everyone is defending the shit out of it because there were *a lot* of flat out haters after Ten left, and no one wants to be associated with them. 

Moffat's run has flaws, but the fandom as a whole won't address them too heavily until it's over.

Again, this is a fairy tale.  Nobody expects realism. Continuity problems are fine, because it's a story about time travel.  small plot holes like we saw in the Davies era are expected and unavoidable.  

But Moffat is literally ruining the show.  The only thing holding it together is the amazing acting of Smith, Gillian, Darvill, and Kingston.  With two of them gone, I'm honestly worried about the show going forward.

FFP is just around the corner and is our highest financial concern. We can't afford to have Downing's and Cole's on £80,000 and £90,000 per week as it is terrible business and why they will surely be offloaded in this window or the next.

It's a writer's trick to pull out when you don't want people going ""Well, why doesn't the Doctor simply..."" and it would be a distraction from the main story.  The problem is, here it's become the main story, the central point of the climax, and it doesn't work.

The real problem with the ending of Angels Take Manhattan, though?  Through all the episodes leading up to it, Moffat teased us with an idea: Amy and Rory are getting old.  Their lives are changing.  They're less and less comfortable with dropping everything to go running off with the Doctor.  It seemed like it was heading to the point where they'd finally say to him ""No, we just can't do it anymore.  We've got adult lives that we can't just abandon.  We haven't got the stamina anymore.""  And the Doctor would lose his companions because he's ageless and humans aren't.  Wouldn't that have been heartbreaking?

true,ColdHotCool,derbyshire,Edinburgh,"No SickOldMan123,  Changing the price after a contract is formed is classified as a Unfair Contract Term.  The ACTUAL reason Tesco didn't send out £50 iPads is because legally a contract wasn't formed.

A Contract is formed when both parties explicitly state they will pay X for Y.  

As a consumer, authorising your bank to transfer funds is all that it takes for your side of the contract to be 'signed'.
As a retailer, you get the choice of stating when a contract is formed, usually a contract is formed upon delivery however the retailer can choose to make it instantly when they receive your money or when they send a email out.


It's called Invitation to Treat, and online shops work the same way as retail shops.  

You walk into a shop and want to buy a set of headphones, the ticket is priced at £50 and that's a invitation.

You take the item to the checkout and the assistant says ""that's £70 please"" at this point there still isn't a contract, no money has passed hands and neither has ownership. 

You point out the price discrepancy and two things will happen, either they will change the price as a gesture of goodwill, or they will refuse (legally entitled to refuse, so long as they do something about the misprice).

It's the same as online, except the law understands having a worker check each item and authorise each payment would be impractical, so it allows the retailer/online seller leeway and time until a human actually interacts with the order.

true,FluffyLion,tardis,TARDIS,"&gt;For example, suddenly Angels can look at one another without penalty, as demonstrated in both Flesh and Stone and in Angels Take Manhattan. Their inability to look at one another was a core plot point in Blink, and to go 180 on that without so much as a hand-waved explanation makes it very difficult to suspend disbelief.

I'm fairly certain they only moved while it was dark, so neither they nor anyone else could see them. I don't remember the episode very well though, but I kind of remember having this thought before too.

&gt;This is also not the only time he changed a fixed point. In ""Father's Day"" he mentions that he can fix the rupture caused by Rose, if only he had his TARDIS. It doesn't work, but only because the Doctor was ""killed"" by the monsters. He rescues a family in ""The Fires of Pompeii,"" despite telling Donna that their deaths were fixed.

Their deaths were not really fixed, the destruction of Pompeii was. In fact, he *had* to save the family so that there could be witnesses to the destruction of Pompeii and for the man to coin the word volcano.

&gt;That's not to mention the fact that he ducked fixed points in The Wedding of River Song and (if I recall correctly) The Big Bang.

In the Wedding of River Song he didn't change the fixed point, the Teselecta dying and making everyone believe HE had died was the fixed point (although they never quite explain why it began to regenerate). The Big Bang was... well, that whole premise was kind of weird time whimey nonsense.

I don't mind the whole ""fixed point"" thing in itself... it was always known that the Doctor was allowed to change certain things and was not allowed to change others, and only he knew which was which because of his Time Lord powers. 

That part is okay with me, because it is a staple of fantasy stories and fairytales.  There are certain rules that exist only because the author says so, and they can be used to make interesting stories. 

The disaster happens when those rules, which are pillars upon which the entire story rests, are suddenly completely rewritten, or ignored.  When that happens, the story collapses in on itself, and it is now up to the actors and the viewers to shoulder the burden.

However, there are a few possibilities that could potentially bring Amy back to our screens anyway. For one, she could have been lying, two, the doctor could have seen her after she wrote the letter. However, it was an exit plot therefore I don't see any of these idea's being used nor would I want them to be used. 

On to the show getting worse with Moffat. I agree with you somewhat, I thought series five was pretty terrible as far as writing goes. Not just for the continuity but I found myself getting bored at the actual stories. Also, the whole remembering the doctor back into existence took away quality from what would have been the only decent story in series five in my opinion.  

However, Moffat has penned some of the best episodes of Doctor Who to date, granted most of these were in the Davies era but they were brilliant nonetheless. Silence in the Library has been the best two parter of all. 

As far as the continuity goes, I think Moffats plots get so over complicated, it is difficult not to mess up continuity. I don't get the whole ""once you have read it has to happen"" thing either. 

Speaking of Paradoxes, what ever happened to the ""everlasting"" reapers from Fathers Day that existed in the void? Both davies and Moffat seem to have conveniently forgotten about those.

I don't know if you watched Shaktar play vs us or Juventus did you see how many chances were created by someone running to the by-line and cutting the ball back like torres did vs west ham. Torres vs west ham is like the only example of this by chelsea i remember this season. Our crosses have been crap this season absolutely crap. So thats one area of our offense not working. Hazard has stopped firing recently in the past 5 games you mention he is winning less free kicks around the box and generally not getting into as good of positions as he was start of the season. Our transition from defense to attack is usually too slow. Plus with every team defending against us deep, every fucking team does it vs us now and we have no one who can shoot from distance imagine how many more goals we would have this season if Meireles or Lampard had the opportunities that Ramires and Mikel have been getting. So you chuck all this in with torres underperforming you get a disfunctional attack from chelsea.

We have great fish restaurants, even if they tend towards the overpriced.

So, Kraft marches in and fucks up our beloved Cadbury's Dairy Milk. Genuinely shitty thing to do. Lots of British consumers notice, and are all pissed, so this is what happens:

1. Brits seek new, better chocolates which are produced by local manufacturers, and/or:
2. Brits band together to create their own chocolate which is as good as if not better than Dairy Milk.

Either way, Dairy Milk eventually loses its appeal and locals stick with their awesome new brand, and the cycle continues.

The moral of the story is, as long as we continue to be conscientious and tasteful consumers, the better brand will always win in the long-term. Let the execs have their short-term pay rise.

Long story long: Rewind about five years and I was working for a medium sized SME and we were interviewing for a new member of staff. We got our pile of ""approved"" CV's from HR and went through the usual process. The best candidate was a recent graduate from a UK university with citizenship from a former commonwealth (I don't remember if this made a difference) country. My team offered her the job, not realising that she was on a student visa and needing sponsorship for a working visa. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks, to about a fortight before this girl was supposed to start and the HR manager comes into our office and freaks the shit out at my team leader. A full blown freak out. Possibly the most unprofessional thing I have ever seen. Apparently she had only just realised that this girl would need sponsorship, and that her CV should never had gotten to our office to be interviewed. One of her team hadn't realised that she needed to be sponsored, and our unofficial policy was that we don't interview people who need sponsorship unless there are litteraly no other suitable aplicants and the job has been advertised for x amount of time (I don't think anyone had ever met these criteria)

My bosses boss stood his ground and insisted on still hiring this girl as she was far and away the best candidate (and was cheaper than her nearest competition), so in the end HR caved and agreed to sponsor her. This apparently invovled a lot of expensive and time consuming paperwork for various licences and permissions, consultation with the Home Office and consulting a specialist law firm (this is office speculation, I wasn't involved with the process). 

Poor girl was ""suspended"" on no pay for a month or two after she was supposed to start whilst the paperwork was sorted out, but did eventually end up working with us almost by accident. I hear she left not long after me, maybe a year later to move back to her home country. 

Sorry if this isn't what you wanted to hear, and it may be an isolated case, but it's what has happened in my experience. Best of luck. ",0,1354664943,null,0,false,0,c7bb5o6,t3_144jjc,t1_c7bb5o6,t3_144jjc,null,1430579254,1,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,1

true,vln,eng-Suffolk,Tractor Boy in exile,"Your understanding of what constitutes 'debit cards' and 'credit cards' seems to be a little different to how the terms are used in the UK.

A credit card is just that, something with which you can run up debt and later repay. The account is completely separate from any bank account. Without a UK credit history, you've got zero chance of getting one.

Debit cards deduct money from your bank account. They're accepted anywhere* that credit cards are, both using the same chip-and-pin authorisation system, and you can withdraw cash from most ATMs without charge (those which do charge you are required to warn you in advance!)

A basic account, which anyone can open (but bring every possible piece of ID you possess, there's strict regulations about that which banks have to follow), is probably all you'll be able to have to start off with. After a few months' regular payments and responsible spending, you'll be able to switch it to a regular current account. To be honest, all the high street banks' products at this level are going to be very similar.


(* It's possible that a basic account only provides you with a Visa Electron card, or the equivalent from MasterCard. These are ones which totally block you from any overdraft by checking your exact balance in real time, and so don't work for retailers where the equipment can't do this, e.g. on planes and trains, and for some reason at some petrol stations. Other than that, for everyday shopping, it's no different to any other debit card.

Can only improve, imo.

All kidding aside, I can't see him having much of a future at LFC.  He shows flashes of quality, but they don't come around often enough to warrant a place in the team (or squad) for me.  My dad's side of the family is exclusively from Sunderland, and thus are massive Sunderland supporters.  As my adopted 2nd team by default (or risk of disownment!), I was completely torn when we bought him for as much as we did.  Happy that Sunderland got a fantastic amount of money for him considering his age and mediocrity, but absolutely gutted that we were the ones silly enough to pay that much.

Great pace, yes. And I admit, sometimes he seems to be the only one in the centre of our midfield willing to put his head down and run at a defense, but he just makes too many mistakes for my liking.  I would love to see him improve, but I'm not sure he will.  We massively overpaid for him and I don't think he'll live up to the hype.

Also, he always looks either confused or in awe when I see him on the screen.  I know he can't help it, but I can't help thinking everytime I see him that he's not quite sure what he's supposed to be doing out there at all.

&gt; This is also not the only time he changed a fixed point. In ""Father's Day"" he mentions that he can fix the rupture caused by Rose, if only he had his TARDIS. It doesn't work, but only because the Doctor was ""killed"" by the monsters.

""Father's Day"" dealt with paradoxes in time and trying to fix them, not fixed points.

&gt; He rescues a family in ""The Fires of Pompeii,"" despite telling Donna that their deaths were fixed.

The death of that family was not fixed, the volcano erupting was.

&gt; Hell, in Angels Take Manhattan itself, Amy changed the text on the gravestone after it was read by being touched by an Angel.

Amy didn't read the gravestone, Rory did. Amy thought she had a choice to stay, we know she really didn't because of ""Amelia's last Farewell"".

&gt; That's not to mention the fact that he ducked fixed points in The Wedding of River Song and (if I recall correctly) The Big Bang.

In TWORS the fixed point ended up being most (or certain) people believing he was dead, not his actual death. As for the big bang, nothing is really fixed when there are 4 people, an exploding TARDIS, and a planet in all of existence.

&gt;What the squatting dispute boils down to is a split between those who consider private property to be sacred, and those who would prioritise the right to shelter. Few people would happily forfeit a second home to squatters, but nor does it feel morally justifiable for a nation to have an estimated 930,000 empty homes while people sleep on the streets

That is possible, and certainly fits with what we know of the Doctor (rule 1), but it is never stated in the show, and I very much doubt it is what Moffat intended when he wrote it.

The very core concept of *The Aztecs* was that it's impossible to change the course of time, the first Doctor even said ""You can't rewrite history. Not one line!"" Think of how limited the show would be if they stuck to that.

Also, this whole RTD v.s. Moffat argument is complete bullshit. RTD didn't fucking create Doctor Who or the concept of how time travel works within the show. A lot of the time travel concepts you see in his episodes were completely new ideas, you can't expect every writer after him to obey his works as if they were scripture.

*EDIT:* I'd like to note that I'm not defending *The Angels Take Manhattan,* it wasn't even very good in my opinion, but for reasons beyond ""the time travel didn't make sense hurr durr."" My biggest criticism is that the entire episode built up to the point where Amy and Rory jumped off the roof and died, but once they survived the tension building up to that point was gone. The climax was over, the sadness is out of everyone's system and the tension was gone. But then all of a sudden an angel comes out of nowhere just gets them - but this time there's no going back. It smelt of a deus ex machina, a plot device Moffat seems to use way to much in his writing. Furthermore It seemed unreasonable after they had just come out victorious against a much bigger crisis, and because the tension is already gone the ""real"" goodbye just doesn't have the same effect. We once again get a few more lines of Amy having a sad goodbye to the Doctor before sacrificing herself, not ten minutes before the last one. There was just nothing left for the audience to feel. It seemed like Moffat wanted to have his cake and eat it, i.e. he wanted to have a cool death scene but then not actually kill them.

Or, on the other hand, he might have seen them as a fixed point- not because they could not be saved, but BECAUSE they WOULD be saved. A fixed point could certainly be created by his decision to save them, because it was something he was always going to do.

If he grows his own tardis and uses it to return to our dimension, the tardis would be able to give him a copy of the sonic screwdriver linked to his DNA, the tenths. The modifications could be because of donnas DNA being in him aswell not river doing them herself.

I'm sure they define the show for *you* and that's great, but there's tons of other writers that defined the show for other people. When RTD created those concepts they were brand new and even retconned previous concepts of time travel. The fact that you think his are somehow the ultimate is only your opinion.

If you look at it that way it's a completely different show every time they replace the cast and writers. By your own logic if Classic Doctor Who is a completely different show from New Doctor Who, then RTD's Doctor Who is also a completely different show from Moffat's Doctor Who. In my opinion, they're all Doctor Who. But I guess that's just tomatoes tomatos.

You have to understand that the fact that you think RTD's Doctor Who is the best is only your opinion. Some people started with Moffat and prefer him over RTD, and plenty, plenty more started before both of them and prefer one of the classic writers. You can't expect Moffat to write his episodes like RTD in the same way you can't expect RTD to write his episodes like the classic writers did. I don't care if it's the show you fell in love with.

Moffat is not *objectively* ruining the show.  That is my opinion. 

However, what *is* objective is that Moffat is changing the show dramatically.  He is rewriting the core concepts that define the show, which is, at the very least, extremely disorienting.  

Especially since he does it without warning.  All the things we thought we knew, the things that made the show a dependable, happy place to be (even when it rips our heart out), are being altered seemingly arbitrarily.  

Every time I think I find my footing with this new-new doctor Who, the rug is pulled out from under my feet again as some other pillar of the show is dissolved for no good reason that I can see. 

It's true that *different* doesn't necessarily mean *bad*.  I *personally* dislike the direction the show is taking.

true,Zevemiel,wardr,Hurt,"Doctors 1 through 6 were all very RP in their accent, which is Received Pronunciation, a sort of slightly posh sounding but very clear manner, also known as 'BBC English'. It's very Home Counties and comforting, all affably English (never British, by the way. Britain has such a huge variety of accents that saying someone has a British accent is a spectacularly pointless statement). 

Doctor 7 (McCoy) spoke in a Scottish burr, McCoy being from Dunoon, a tiny town on the west coast of Scotland. For scots, it's quite a soft gentle accent, which if compared with a Glasgow/Glaswegian accent can be very harsh, and hard to understand. 

McGann is from Liverpool (think Lister from Red Dwarf), but you can't really hear any kind of trace of that accent any more, as he speaks in the RP tones of 1-6. Even speaking out of character, McGann is quite RP. Blame acting school. 

Eccleston is from Salford, just outside Manchester (or part of Manchester, depending on who you ask), and as such has kept his northern accent in playing the Doctor. Lots of planets have a north, indeed. 

Tennant is another Scot, from Paisley this time (like Moffat), but loses his natural accent in a fake one of Estuary English, which is a sort of soft London accent (apples and pears, me old china), with some elements of RP popping in every now and again (think ""Have you MET the *French*?!"" versus ""There was a war, Sarah Jane. Everyone died."" Almost completely different accents). Some would rather unkindly say 'mockney'. There was a line deleted from Christmas Invasion about Rose 'imprinting' on the Doctor like a baby chick, so his accent sort of copies hers. 

Smith is from Nottingham, which is the posh side of the Midlands, and their accent is quite Home Counties too, add that with drama school, and we've got another RP Doctor!

true,Endriod,troughton,Troughton,"You're completely right. After watching so many heads of the show come and go I forget how disorienting it can be for viewers after their first big production change. I would like to add that Moffat is rewriting the core concepts that define *Davies' Era* of the show, not the show itself, but in the long run as did most new head writers. RTD himself is more guilty of that than anyone (and not necessarily for the better or worse). 

I don't think Moffat isn't making it any easier on himself abandoning RTD's core concepts, especially because he's taking over a fan base that is largely familiar with only RTD's episodes. Moffat isn't writing the show with RTD's era as a standard, he, like RTD himself, believe that classic Doctor Who is *the* Doctor Who. Moffat sees RTD's era just as most RTD fans including yourself see Moffat's era; different and unlike what he grew up with, therefore alienating and less sentimental or nostalgic value. I think Moffat's trying to distance himself from RTD and be his own writer, as well as show newer fans that RTD's era isn't *just* how Doctor Who has to be, whether he should be cushioning the writing to be a bit more like RTD for the fan's sake or if his episodes are any good at all in the first is completely up to debate, I often flip-flop on the issue myself. Moffat's in the hot seat right now, he and Matt get scrutinized like crazy because they're the current ones, people did the same with RTD when he was still writing. I'm hopeful that when Moffat's gone people (myself included) will see him in a much more positive light than we did when he was still writing, just as people did with RTD.

On the bright side for you, because there are just so many new fans of Doctor Who who started watching during RTD's era, I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of future showrunners will think of RTD's Doctor Who as their ""the"" Doctor Who, and use his episodes as a standard for their own.",0,1354674922,null,0,false,0,c7be0c4,t3_14a5tp,t1_c7be0c4,t1_c7bd5be,null,1430580674,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

The move reflects the recent decision by the Church of England synod to reject the introduction of female bishops, consequently ignoring the last century of the equal rights movement.
Having spent ‘a lot of time exploring this issue, seeking God’s wisdom on it and discussing it together’ the CU executive committee decided that it was no longer appropriate for women to teach alone at weekly meetings, or be the main speaker at the CU weekend away.
Women are now also banned from speaking alone at the group’s mission weeks.
However, it’s not all gloom and doom: women are allowed to speak as a double act with their husbands. Those who are unmarried must remain silent.

&gt;As for you Mr/Mrs threadstarter, good luck with your idea and aspirations. Though if (and that's a doubtful ""if"" IMO), drugs are legalised, it will be tobacco companies, alcohol companies and pharma companies who will be making most of the money from it. At the moment, they are against legalisation, but if the law shows signs of changing, they will jump on it. I hope you can fit into that picture somewhere!

I think that it will happen although that is obviously not a topic for here but say it does there will be place for a fresh face who doesn't just want to sell millions - i'll do that anyway, i'm selling drugs - but also promote and educate on responsible use and having a real idea of the risks, the benefits and the general feel of drugs so it's not a guessing game of what you're getting into (in which I mean the feeling of the drug, not street impurities) and there will be a further market in making drugs that are currently sold as powders for example MDMA in palatable drinks and foods. I also think that whether or not you agree with drug legalisation that if they are legal i'm the kind of person you want to be selling to you.

Don't get me wrong, the money is a huge motivator. But so is all the great experiences and feelings i've had on drugs and seeing all the people damaged by misinformation and other issues that permeate drug culture above the laws. I want to sell 'em, but I want to re-brand 'em and make them a lot less sacred and mysterious and a fact of life that some people choose to engage in and all the power to them (within limits, for example drug driving at a dangerous level/on a dangerous substance for driving of which many test would have to be made pre-legalisation along with new education and in depth, unbiased studies. It's about saving lives and having fun experiences, not politics or personal agendas). 

I dunno, maybe i'm wrong, but I think that a guy like me could do it if I did it right. I know it's not really anything but I did business in school for 6 years, i've run many small communities and sites over the years and stuff so I have the potential as long as i'm not an idiot.

I suggest you actually watch Torres when our midfield players are attacking and you'll notice him standing there staring at our players hoping for magical balls to just float to his feet.

A massive moment in recent history would be http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/2976539.stm  Against Hull in 2003, loose that match and we were out of the football league, we had 1 player contracted to the club for the next season so the future was dark.

We win 4-2 an unsung hero these days James Thomas got an incredible hatrick and being there to see it live was a moment I'll never forget. It saved our status and from there well, its been incredible

We've had a lot of fantastic players come through the club, not just in terms of footballing skill but just the fun loving and fan appriciation side you have people like Roger Freestone, who in my opinion is THE Swansea legend. Over 500 games for the club and was loved by everyone.

The one that most people remember is Lee Trundle, we got him on a free from Wrexham as kind of an unknown entity in the league, he had a level of skill as you've seen in the video above that outshone everyone in league 2/1 and was an incredible joy to watch.

But the unsung hero is the chairman Huw Jenkins, what he's done for this club, the quality of people he's brought in as backroom staff and the way he's watched over the signings is the main reason behind our success in my opinion, I mean we've lost 2 fantastic managers in a few years and gone from strength to strength, every time we loose a fantastic player (Sinclair to Man City) we seem to improve upon it (Pablo Hernandez)


Some more players that come to mind are the likes of Alan Curtis one of our best forwards, over 350 games for us, still part of the staff now and when Rodgers left for Liverpool Curtis refused to leave because he has swansea in his heart.

Leon Britton is also a legend at Swansea, one of the most intelligent passers of the ball I've ever seen, again well over 350 games and still going strong.

Ivor Allchurch is probably THE legend at Swansea almost 450 games for us, another fantastic forward and there's a statue for Ivor outside the stadium.

There's plenty more you can look out for and read about, where I'm from (Port Talbot) just outside of Swansea our local team tends to have a lot of the ex Swansea players or Swansea youth come play for us to get some match experience so I'm very luck to get to watch the Old and New generations of Swansea and see some of the younger players working their way through like Ben Davis which is always fun to see.

(A little known fact is we also gave Frank Lampard his chance to shine) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5QQJ3vakPQ

However, I'm not going to be that guy.  I ask that you please consider your tone as well.

Now, to address your point.  I would expect the rules to be completely different between Classic Who and New Who.  They are completely different shows and operate in completely different settings.  Also, there was a great deal of time between the two. 

The problem with what Moffat is doing is that he is changing the rules spontaneously and arbitrarily, and in doing so, he is completely changing the show we know and love.  Changing it into a fundamentally different show. 

That isn't necessarily a bad thing, if we had some warning that the show was going in a new direction, and if the new direction strengthened the show and made it better.  Instead, I feel like a rug is pulled out from under me every time Moffat decides to take what was a fundamental truth in the show, and ignore or completely alter it without so much as a hand-waved explanation.  What's worse, the changes he is making are bad storytelling, and they are making the show worse, not better.

Watch the first three seasons again and try to tell me that s5 and s6 are even close to being on par.

I don't *want* to have to stop watching the show.  I love this show.  I love the characters, I love the drama, I love the comedy and the banter. 

You know how sometimes the people you love the most end up hurting you the most?  That doesn't necessarily mean you stop loving them, or eject them from your life. 

This new, arbitrary direction Moffat is taking is painful.  It is very difficult to watch a season of the show, knowing that the end of the season is likely to be extremely disappointing like the end of S5 and S6 were.  Never knowing what fundamental truth about the show might end up being changed without warning or reason?  

Moffat is a great writer and a terrible head writer.  He needs someone above him who can pull the reins in now and again, because the way things are going, the show is going to fall apart within the next season and a half. 

I don't want that.

If you look around the comments of this post, you'll find that there are many others who feel the way I do.  It hurts us, but we're not just going to turn our backs, because this show means a great deal to many of us, myself included.  To suggest that I should ""just stop watching"" implies to me that you don't feel about this show the way I do.

Paradoxes and fixed points in time aren't the same thing, IMO, though they do get kind of intertwined in Series 6. The ending of TATM was about the risk of paradox that would result from changing what the Doctor had already observed.  I don't like that Amy's name appeared on the tombstone after the Doctor leaves, the whole reason there's a risk of a paradox was because they already saw Rory's name on it. It would have worked better if instead the camera panned to a nearby tombstone and showed her name there.  
I half wonder if this giant plothole is actually on purpose to give Moffat an out for involving Amy and Rory in a season finale and/or next year's anniversary special.

Nothing that happened in Father's Day was a fixed point, that was all about the paradox caused by Rose saving her father. 

I also don't think the Doctor broke any ""fixed point"" rules at Pompeii. The fixed point was the destruction of the whole city because of its impact on history, not the deaths of anyone in particular. Here's what I took from the ending of that episode: the Doctor is so focused on the fact that he can't save the city that he can't see that he can still save *someone* without disrupting history until Donna convinces him. 

As an aside, I always thought the ending to The Waters of Mars was bullshit. The reason that Adelaide's death was a fixed point was because it inspired others to push forward with space travel. How the hell does her dying by her own hand on Earth at the same time the Mars base blows up not completely screw that up? Who would be inspired by her suicide?

When they realised that Downing, Carroll and Hendo to an extent were all overvalued and over paid (£80,000/£70,000 per week) and they didn't achieve CL football, it meant that spending would be curbed and overpaid players would have to leave. That's why Kuyt and Maxi were allowed to leave as both were earning close to £100,000 per week. Younger players should be cheaper and so it makes sense to invest here. We aren't a club who can afford £100,000 a week wages as we have Downing's and Cole's on similar money on our bench and revenues aren't high enough to facilitate all 3.

Second, he said he can't save all of the people in Pompeii, he can't stop the volcano erupting cuz he caused it to erupt. The fixed point is the eruption of the volcano. That was the fixed point.

That shows that he couldn't, he only knows of the timeline of the universe, not the timeline of every single person. Also, isn't the point of the companions to change the way The Doctor sees life? 9 let Cassandra die whereas 10 wouldn't have let that happen. 10 realized he can save people, just not to mess with the fixed point. Of course he went too far and mixed it up when he saved the crew from Mars and realized after that her death was the fixed point: she killed herself regardless cuz she understood her significance.

Think of it this way, with Captain Adelaide in Waters of Mars her death was important because it inspired her granddaughter to follow in her grandmother's footsteps and basically set universal exploration into motion. Now Amy and Rory had to go back in time and thus caused X and the Doctor knew that if he looked for them, if got them back and took them out for adventures or just took them home, they'd end up back in time, away from him and he would lose them again. It's like the idea of fate. That is what was supposed to happen and is always what is supposed to happen. The universe always finds a way to correct itself. Further evidence of this can be seen in Vincent and The Doctor. Vincent still kills himself, like he was supposed to, but like the doctor says they added to his pile of good things.

Now in the case of the Christmas Carol, the doctor changes the personal history of a man in a way that only affects him personally as well as the safety of his town and the space ship that is about to crash. This event isn't tied to anything in the grand scheme of Universal history the way that human-space exploration is. It will have an affect but not in the way that the Waters on Mars scenario would.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Excerpt from my blog about this:

The seventh Doctor is my favorite. I told myself when I started watching classic many months ago that I wouldn't pick a favorite. I wanted to love all the Doctors. And I do. But the seventh has stolen my heart.

He's got a dry humor with a dark Time Lord power underneath, and of course, a kickass companion: Ace. Their relationship is so unique, it's a tag-team ""you do the talking, I do the walking"" with 7 as a sort of stand-in parent/guide and tutor. Yet at the same time, it's almost, if you want to put on the goggles, romantic. But because of the tutor/guide thing and 7's distant otherness, it's very platonic.

And by dark Time Lord power I mean that during the seventh Doctor's era you got the feeling that while the seventh seems like a goofy dusty professor on the outside, sometimes you can tell there's an undercurrent of something. This something is alien, it's terrifying, and it's dangerous.

But it's different from the godlike awe I get from the tenth Doctor. This is where it gets hard to explain. The tenth Doctor's godlike-ness, in my opinion, relates to his vanity. Both are very unique to the tenth Doctor (unlike the shallow narcissism of the sixth or fourth).

But the tenth Doctor makes you think that he is some kind of tragic and lonely god high above us who lives in another plane. The seventh Doctor feels more like a pervasive sense of otherness. Dark otherness. (That and it's been pointed out to me that while Tennant is a fantastic actor, he can't do ""eccentric"" to save his life despite being a master at barely-concealed-anger. McCoy has the opposite acting strength/weakness.)

Btw, this dark sense of otherness is very strong in the novel *Lungbarrow*. Funnily enough, he is revealed to be the Other in the novel and his cousins in the House of Prydon often wonder what the Doctor is. He's Time's Champion for one thing...

What's interesting is that I say these things about the seventh Doctor but I don't know how I reached this feeling. Probably because of the story *Remembrance of the Daleks*. It was my first seventh Doctor story. I think. I don't know why, but there's something compelling about his personality. It's a blend of dignity and humility, comedy and darkness.

**in retrospect** he's also an amazing Doctor (and I'm more sure he's my favorite now) because of his excellent run on Big Finish Productions' audio drama range. McCoy's stories have made me cry. Yup. And break my heart. And just recently I listened to what is, imo, the best radio drama I've heard yet out of 200+ and it's with SEVEN.

**Information**: Despite the term ""radio drama"" it's primarily just for purchased on www.bigfinish.com (though it has been on radio).

To be honest this isn't that big of a deal, even if we don't spend big in January. 

* The Red Sox are a self sustaining club, what FSG want us to become eventually, and have a lot of money to spend to even get close to where their payroll has been the past few years. They're trying to shrewdly reinvest that money in a rebuilding year, with a new manager. Honestly they might just retool and skip the rebuilding phase, but that's because people expect the Sox to compete every year, and they have an income that allows them to do that.

* January really is a shit time of year to be purchasing players, everyone is usually buying out of need, driving the transfer prices up. I'm not expecting a big investment unless it's the right situation, a semi-young player for a reasonable price. Mostly I expect us to add to the depth of the team, with players like Ince, if we add anyone like Stuttridge or Huntelaar that would be a bonus in my eyes.

Episodes like ""A Good Man Goes to War,"" for example, really show off his darker side.

Then, David Tennant came along. Took a little bit to get used to him, but by the time he left the series, he'd edged out 11 for me. He brought a real humanity and pathos to the character, and could be every bit as kick-ass (when necessary) as 11.

I've gone back and looked at some of the pre-9 Doctors, and while the modern series has kind of ruined the older shows for me because I have trouble getting past the super low-budget cheesiness of the sets, aliens, etc., I do have to say I also like 4 (Tom Baker) and 5 (Peter Davison). Baker brought his own cans of whoop-ass to the show, while Davison has a bit of the Tennant humanity about his performance.

Clasie, on the other hand, would fit in better; he'd play in the back half of midfield, where Sandro and Dembele are; I think he'd be a great spot player late on in games if we want to give Dembele a blow, or he could come on for Sandro if we needed a little extra attacking verve; his passing is very, very good.

true,stikeymo,eng-shropshire,Salopian in San Francisco,"From living in the US for a year, I've come to appreciate many things about being British, such as and not limited to:

* The NHS is fucking amazing. Yes, it's not without its flaws and can be improved, but by Christ, it wipes the floor with the pitiful joke that is the US healthcare system.

* The BBC is brilliant and will be badly missed.

* British humour and the fact that generally we don't take ourselves too seriously is something I really miss. Yanks don't do silly too well, it always ends up feeling all a bit too Big Bang Theory to me.

* Up until the whole tuition fees thing started to go down the shitter, the opportunities our education system afforded were great. It'll be interesting/worrying to see what the effects of burdening students with crazy levels of debt will be, but I'm not sure I see too many positives with trying to make our university system closer to the US in cost (rather than trying to promote alternatives such as apprenticeships, etc., alongside trying to keep access to university as open as possible).

* British English has the best insults. That being said, it allows for some marvellous opportunities in office based passive aggression. Annoying ginger bell end juggling? Complement him on his abilities as a tosser.

Things I've realised I'm not so keen on include:

* British negativity/pessimism can sometimes be a bit self-perpetuating and self-fulfilling. Although having said that, I fucking miss having a good whinge.

* The lack of reaction to what the Conservative government's being doing is baffling to my eyes, although a general disinterest in politics seems to be a very Western problem right now. Makes you wonder how bad things have to get before people will kick up a fuss...

* Kinda related to the above, but the very British thing of not realising how good many things are in the UK and how little people want to defend them. To my somewhat raving lefty sensibilities, the BBC and the NHS are two of, if not *the* two, greatest British creations of the 20th Century.

* As others have mentioned, chavs and binge drinking are crap. I've kinda forgotten they exist over here, to be honest. Don't miss them at all.

true,ProtoKun7,smith,Smith,"Apologies if these have been answered already.

&gt;For example, suddenly Angels can look at one another without penalty, as demonstrated in both Flesh and Stone and in Angels Take Manhattan.  Their inability to look at one another was a core plot point in Blink, and to go 180 on that without so much as a hand-waved explanation makes it very difficult to suspend disbelief. 

That one is a little awkward, yes. Still, maybe after spending so long like that they've developed a method to limit their vision or make sure they will still be able to move to look away and unfreeze the Angel they're looking at.

&gt;Which brings me to the end of Manhattan. 

&gt;""If you read something, it cannot be changed.""

&gt;""Fixed points are immutable."" 

&gt;False and false. 

&gt;Remember Waters of Mars?  Not only did 10 change a fixed point, but he actually *changed the writing on the newspapers he had read.*  

&gt;True, this had all sorts of nasty unintended consequences, and is something he *should not do,* but the idea that he *cannot* is patently false. 

Yes, the incident was changed, but certain parts of it remained the same, so perhaps some elements were more fixed than others; the universe was able to manoeuvre around it, so to speak. The base still exploded and all but two of the crew died, so the important parts were mostly the same. Perhaps if Adelaide had not shot herself it would have been worse.

Regarding ""if you read something, it cannot be changed"", that's not always necessarily the case. ""Sometimes knowing the future is what allows you to change it.""

&gt;This is also not the only time he changed a fixed point.  In ""Father's Day"" he mentions that he can fix the rupture caused by Rose, if only he had his TARDIS.  It doesn't work, but only because the Doctor was ""killed"" by the monsters.  He rescues a family in ""The Fires of Pompeii,"" despite telling Donna that their deaths were fixed.  *(""That's just it. Don't you see, Donna? Can't you understand? If I could go back and save them then I would, but I can't. I can never go back, I can't. I just can't, I can't."")*

The events of *Father's Day* were not a fixed point. The problem arose because Rose created a paradox by changing the outcome after being present a second time and negating what they saw the first time. Had it been achieved the first time, there may not have been a problem.

&gt;Hell, in Angels Take Manhattan itself, Amy changed the text on the gravestone *after it was read* by being touched by an Angel.

Amy's future was still in flux at this point. It was only after being touched that it became fixed.

&gt;That's not to mention the fact that he ducked fixed points in The Wedding of River Song and (if I recall correctly) The Big Bang. 

No he didn't. The fixed point at Silencio was always how it happened, as even the first time he was inside the Teselecta. I'm not sure what fixed point in *The Big Bang* you're referring to, as I don't recall there being one.

&gt;So, the idea that he is *unable* to change what he read in River's novel is false.  As such, the only explanation is that he is *unwilling* to do what it takes to get them back. 

&gt;However, there is a problem here too. 

&gt;11 has made it very, VERY clear that he will break *any* rules for Amy and Rory.  They are far and away the closest companions the Doctor has ever had (in the new series, anyway).  He has broken the rules for them over and over again, and given how utterly distraught he was to lose them, would he really *choose* to leave them behind, regardless of the consequences?

Not in this case. The time distortions create a big problem with that situation as it is, plus the dangers creating a second paradox would pose were too great. Destroying New York and potentially even losing Amy and Rory in the process is something he would not be willing to do. Yes, he wants them to stay, but he doesn't want to risk Earth just to do that. Even if he did, they might argue that it was not worth the risk.

I might not been in this fandom for long, but I never found any discussion that basically gushes over how consistent the continuity the older Doctor Who episodes had.

That is not what makes Doctor Who memorable.

What makes Doctor Who memorable has always been the characters, but specifically, the Doctor himself. The most fascinating, fantastic and brilliant person in the universe. More than half of this show is simply answering ""What if the Doctor faced this situation?"" (What if the Doctor tries to change time? What if the Doctor taught in a classroom? What if the Doctor met Shakespeare? What if the Doctor played football?) The overall plot, while crucial, has always been secondary. The classic Doctors for example, people never discuss how good their overall story was, they discuss how good they are as a Doctor incarnation. People discuss their characters, not the time travel tropes used in their stories. 

I'm sure these kinds of discussions will be boring after a while, but people would glad to debate who is the best Doctor. This is what will drive people to analyse and discuss for years to come.

If before the season you had offered me a top four finish and progression in the CL and the domestic cups, while playing sexy football I would have taken it. I think our fast start made many people lose sight of that.

He's right in that our transfer policy failed us as the end of the window approached. We have an extremely light squad especially in strikers and center mids and we're already paying for it.

The article loses me on the RDM/Rafa section though. Hire Rafa as a scapegoat? Wut. Hire him to guarantee getting out of the CL group? Then why do after it is out of our own hands? Even if we smash Nordsjaelland, Juventus still has to lose in Ukraine. Hire Rafa to get Torres going? Scary if that's how the club is actually run.

This is a young squad and a small one that is absolutely in a transition. It's just a shame that it doesn't have a manager to grow with it.

Predicting outcomes of early birth is not an exact science. My daughter has cerebral palsy, having been born 8 weeks early due to an 'ischaemic insult' (oxygen deprivation). She's got a decent quality of life, despite her disability. Compare her with her pal who was born at 24 weeks, and is only very mildly affected, having a bit of a problem in one arm. Then compare both of them with another kid in their class, who was born full term, but is much more severely disabled than either of them. 

When my daughter was born, we got prognoses ranging from  'severely physically disabled, with profound learning difficulties' to 'she might have a bit of bother playing piano with her left hand'.

As to the relative amounts spent, well, things were getting better in terms of state support for the disabled, but that seems to be a trend that's reversing. So I can't really posit a guess as to the why's and wherefores.

In my experience, Lloyds TSB are quite good at offering a fairly feature complete package, but they do charge for overseas transactions unless you are on one of their mor expensive account structures. Nationwide, I think, are the best for this in terms of free / cheap overseas tx fees. 

Another option for you might be to open a Santander account in Portugal and see if they can help you open a reciprocal account with Santander UK.

Also not sure about Lucas and Allen in the same team in the long term if we want to be competiting for top 4. As fantastic as Allen is in the holding role he's not really providing enough in the final third for me, and you need an absolutly fantastic AMC and ST for that not to result in gaps or lack of runs (when Gerrard and Torres were on fire their relationship was insane plus we had Alonson's awesome balls form deep). Better wingers might make it acceptable but I remain a bit pessamistic about it.

Things that annoy me:

Piers Morgan

How tribalistic our political system is. 

How politically apathetic people are.

true,dr_chickolas,null,null,"I'll add a few that haven't yet been mentioned, as someone who has lived outside UK for several years now.

Things I like/miss:

* Sense of humour

* People whinge about lots of little things, but we are fairly stoic in the face of true adversity.

* Good country pubs

* Our music culture - so many good bands, open mic nights and small gigs in every town and city. Not so in many other countries.

* Bureaucracy is very low compared to much of the rest of the world. Things like buying a car, paying taxes etc are much easier in UK than in many other countries.

* Corruption is comparatively low and the UK is reasonably close to a meritocracy, i.e. generally you don't have to ""know the right people"" to get a decent job. This last aspect is much much worse in some other countries.

Things I don't like/miss:

* People getting wankered and fighting each other on Friday night. The relaxed nights out on the continent are so much better.

* People exporting the above tradition to other countries when on holiday, making us all look like twats.

* Slightly xenophobic/superior attitude that a certain sector of British people have towards the rest of the world and the EU in particular.

* The ridiculous number of rules and laws we have to protect people from their own stupidity, thus creating a society where anything that goes wrong is anyone's fault but their own.

* The culture of reverse-snobbery: that in the UK so many people are desperate to prove how they are from solid working-class roots and went to the University of Life, despite coming from a clearly very comfortable background. Similarly, that being well-educated in anything makes you some kind of posh snob.

* That we are a bit cold as people: families are generally very weak and neighbours barely speak to each other. We could learn some things from the southern europeans on that one.

* (a minor one): we eat a lot of shit food and we don't look after our bodies well enough. Not to say that we don't have good food in the UK, but there is too much crap around.

* That the tabloid press still bring up ""the war"" at every opportunity, e.g. any time there is a sporting match with Germany or some kind of EU policy. It's just embarrassing and makes us look a little sad, like the last time we did anything worthwhile was in the 40s. Time to move on guys.

* The weather. Most people in the UK don't realise that our climate is really quite crap, compared to most of the rest of Europe.

I hope I didn't sound too negative though, because the UK is still one of the best places to live in the world.

The point I'm (perhaps cack-handedly) trying to make by mentioning my mate and his business, my daughter and her pals, is that at birth, you just can't tell who will thrive, and who will not. The healthcare system is geared to assume that it's more ethical to assume the best possible outcome, just in case.

The fact that afterwards, the severely disabled are more likely than the rest of us to be dependent on assistance is the price we as a society pay for being ethical.

That's flat out wrong. Opportunity is basically social mobility. Numerous studies and reports show social mobility in this country has been declining since 1950, and in fact we have some of the worst rates of social mobility in the Western world.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12339401

&gt;If you were born to an average family in 1958, you were more likely to get a job in the professions when you grew up than someone arriving just 12 years later, in 1970.

http://www2.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2007/SocialMobilityDec07.aspx

&gt;Social mobility in the UK remains at the low level it was for those born in 1970, with recent generations of children's educational outcomes still overwhelmingly tied to their parents' income.

true,pbwra,present,Oscar,"My god I hope you're right. I mostly tend to agree with you however there's a couple of reasons why I think united is a real threat to us getting jose back. 

If he wants to manage united then managing chelsea in the interim would be a significant barrier to achieving such an ambition much as managing city would be. Not to the same extent, but I think it would be a problem to go straight from one to the other and he has said many times he doesn't want a long career. 

Also there's fergie's retirement... I think it will happen suddenly, united won't play a competitive fixture with his retirement announced and I think he has faith in jose to keep city out of contention in spite of united's perceived weakness. 

But honestly, I can't see anyone else in the existing managers pool doing the job well enough for roman. Carlo getting the sack confirms that absolutely for me. Maybe pep.. but I just find it hard to believe he would come to chelsea, and I'm not certain that he definitely would be able to thrive in our environment.

http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/why/evidence/social-mobility

I don't think you can blame everything on poor parenting and lack of work ethic. There are significant societal structural problems that hinder opportunity, and as a result social mobility. 

&gt;Like I said, the limiting factor is usually the person themselves and their state of mind, rather than the lack of opportunity in the country itself.

Evidence?

&gt; Even if you are from a poor family, you can still get your gcses, then A levels and you can go to uni.

You *can* do these things, but you face significantly more obstacles and difficulties than someone from a wealthy family. Statistically, you are more unlikely to do any of these things purely as a product of how much your parents earn.

&gt;Our problem is that kids from poor families often aren't brought up to work hard at school and go to university. 

Again, evidence? Or is it also that schools in poor areas have shit schools? I went to an inner city school and my education was essentially a stepping stone for NQT's and supply teachers.

I just... I dont get too concerned when i find someone has stolen something from a huge multinational company like that. I dont get concerned at all.

If i see you walk into an independantly run shop and steal something, i think you're an absolute prick and you deserve a slap.

But Apple? I have an apple macbook pro, i've always preferred apples over PC's. But i've never really been able to afford one (I used an incredibly old G3 tower untill I got to university and they had an insane discount on the pros). I deem them incredibly overpriced. They are. The way apple make money is dirty and exploitative. So if anything, i'm cheering the thief on.

I understand this is a controversial opinion and will warrant downvotes, but i'm only stating it because i think it would be interesting to invite someone to show me the errors of my ways.


So explain to me, why is it 'wasteful' that a couple of poor kids from local coincil estates decide to go into an apple store and help themselves to an incredibly overpriced product, from a company that deliberately times its 'innovations' to keep its 'fanboys' coming back year after year for products with very little improvements, who use [increasingly questionable electronics manufactures foxconn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn). Would it be somehow less wasteful for a middle class socalite to stroll in there, spend a good couple of thousand pounds on unjustifiably expensive hardware and software?

http://scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search?cat=377

And the very document you have posted says that no member should be discriminated against on the basis of their religious belief.

Associate members, and volunteers on attempting to progress in the organisation are not permitted. Purely on the basis of their religious faith. 

I have imagined nothing. They claim not to discriminate based on religious belief in black and white. And then they do so. Banning people and kicking them out, on the basis of their religion is the very definition of discrimination, that they insist repeatedly and explicitly they do not engage in, including in the very document you have posted. In your words ""for all to see"".

Please tell me where this is not correct?

If they said we ""do not discriminate against any member on the basis of religious belief, except for atheists, humanists, and non-theistic agnostics"" that would be fine. They do not. To the contrary they claim to not discriminate on the basis of religious belief in any way. They also say they put ""Inclusion at the heart of the organisation"" while only including certain faiths. 

I would add as an LGBT activist/organiser (who works with homeless LGBT youth before you go chucking your ""Oh these people are moaners who don't do anything for kids stick) I have received a large amount of material soliciting for volunteers and recruiting. They emphasise HEAVILY and repeatedly the non-discriminatory stance of the scouts, in an attempt to get people to give their time.

NOWHERE do they say, oh, but only for certain religions, otherwise we officially discriminate.

If you are a faith group, available only to members of certain faiths, that is great, I have absolutely no issue with the existence of such groups. 

But you are not allowed to sell yourself as a organisation that puts ""inclusion at its heart"", and does not discriminate against people based on faith if you are such a group. And that is exactly what they do.





Edit: I would add that document you linked only says members are ""encouraged"" to engage in the religious element. It does NOT say faith in a god is mandatory, which, if a scout is to not lie when taking an oath it is. Anywhere. Whilst on the other hand in multipe places it emphasises that neither any youth member, nor any adult volunteering their time should be discriminated against on the basis of religious belief.

West Ham (Away) - Draw - We won't have Suarez, and they are pretty strong at the moment, just beat Chelsea 3-1. And we're playing Away, so it may be a little tough.

Aston Villa (Home) - Win - We're playing at Home, and Aston Villa have lost quite a few games, and their GA is nothing to be proud of. Anything less than a win are points dropped, no doubt.

Fulham (Home) - Win - Might be quite difficult, they actually have the highest GF in the bottom half of the table right now, so they can most definitely score goals. But since this is a Home game, I'm hoping we can scrape out a narrow win.

Stoke (Away) - Win (or Draw at the very least) - I think we have the ability to win this one, but we may have to settle for a draw. Stoke are really physical and against our inexperienced and young side, it's going to be tough breaking through their defence. They managed to hold Chelsea for 87 minutes at Stamford Bridge until Ashley Cole, of all people, finally scored. With our current goal problem plus their strong defence, not going to be very easy, especially away.

For a start, Northern Ireland is not a country.  Whoever keeps shouting ""our wee country"" in some sort of act of defiance needs to briefly revise the geography behind all this. it's often called a country, granted, but it really isn't. This should help: http://geography.about.com/cs/politicalgeog/a/statenation.htm

Secondly, this was a non-issue until brought up by our dear representatives.  It was a flag on a pole outside Shitty Hall.  The ""prods"" didn't care until it was being taken away, and the ""cathlicks"" didn't make a sound about it either.  The news didn't cover it, no phone-ins, no headlines in the Telegraph about a flag.  I've also recently learned that the Stormont buildings already have in place the same proposal that was just established for the city hall's union flag, being that it was to fly on certain days of the year, instead of 365.  I have yet to be reminded or notified of any kick-up that occurred over that happening.

What has irritated me more is the whole issue of United Ireland/No Surrender being brought up over this.  No, there is no ""surrending"" happening, and there is not a chance of a United Ireland in my lifetime.  On one side, you have a small region with fuck-all export left, its main industrial trade all but gone, a hangover and bitter taste between its citizens from 30 years of Troubles, 20% of its money coming in from the mainland, and 30% of its workforce employed by the public sector.  On the other hand, you have a nation that has seen its economy collapse, an is in dire need of a cash injection.  Who in their right mind, regardless of political affiliation, would consider heaping another 1.8 million people onto a struggling nation a wise move?  It won't happen for a while.

On top of that, we can't simply replace the Union flag with one for Northern Ireland as we don't have one.  And we can't fly the tricolor either, nor the Ulster flag.

They discriminate based on religious belief.  

They are indeed upfront about their rules. As you say, they have listed, quite clearly, particular things they do not discriminate against. They then discriminate on the basis of one of them.

As I have said, I am bombarded with material emphasising their discrimination policies. I expect them to follow them. As per their own words, their own list of things they do not discriminate against, it is a lie.

I cannot fathom a position where saying ""you cannot join because of your particular religious beliefs"" is not discriminating based on religious belief.

To back me up here: UK law, government, official bodies, charities and other voluntary organisations, and the European court of human rights concurs that discriminating against someone because they are an atheist/humanist etc is discriminating based on their religious beliefs. If you fire someone because of their atheism, you will be breaking laws that forbid discrimination based on religious belief.

Now my point is not that the scouts are breaking the law here, or that they dont have the right to discriminate.

My point is that by any official definition, discriminating against someone based on their atheism/humanism etc, is discriminating against them based on their religious beliefs

They are the ones claiming not to discriminate on the basis of religious belief, while discriminating on the basis of religious belief. They could easily remove that piece of text as long as they want to retain policies that discriminate on the basis on religious belief.

true,Kogknight,eccleston,Eccleston,"While this is true, and characters are more important than story, to a degree, once someone lays down a minor canon or trivial fact, one best stick to it until it is long forgotten enough to change. 

Blink, the episode that introduced the Weeping Angels, is often regarded as one of the favorite episodes of fans of all time. Its kind of a big deal, and people are going to hold on to an idea and create a world around it. 

What gets people involved, and what makes a great piece of cinema, is the ability for the viewer to construct an understanding of a world around it, the way they would construct a world around a book. 

The difference is, over long periods of time, you can warp and bend the rules and canons. The less favoured and more archaic a canon is, the more easily it is rewritten without damage to the world image the viewer has built. However, when you take one of the most popular bits of canon and start fucking with it, that world falls apart. 

And with it, the understanding of our characters. See, the characters should react properly to the world about them, and more specifically, the world image that the viewer has built in their head, and this takes great, talented, and skilled actors and writers to do. They use the show as a seed, and then control and shape the more superfluous world the viewer imagines. When our image, inspired by older material, is conflicted by new material, we ourselves are conflicted. Its called a plot hole, and isn't good for a story, or the characters in it.

The characters start reacting to stimulus we believe they shouldn't even worry about. Stuff that should be a non issue suddenly becomes one, and it is a poor writing technique. 

I'm not saying Classic Doctor Who had perfect continuity, I'm saying when they changed their canon, they did it slowly and subtly. Like a frog being boiled in water. Not the what Moffat did with the angels, which was like throwing a frog in a vat of oil. It wasn't subtle, and was one of the larger and well known and loved pieces of canon, and to mess with it, although it is within his rights and wills, is not the best idea for the strength of the series.

2) Phone your supplier the day you move in and give a reading, this is essential to reduce how much they will fuck it up.

3) Take a photo of the meter reading so you can remember what it is.

4) Your new supplier will put you onto a contract designed to empty your wallet, gouge out your eyeballs and shit on your cat. As soon as possible get on a price comparison site and switch suppliers or tariff.

5) Sign up for online billing with a fixed monthly direct debit, this is an easy way to save money.

6) If you have a prepayment meter do whatever is necessary to get off it as it's a method for eating your money.

7) Every month take your own meter reading and send it in to keep your bills accurate.

8) Don't switch to someone just because they're the cheapest, check on the internet for customer service reviews. Some of these tiny suppliers can offer low prices by having support managed by a really clever goat located high on the Mongolian steppes.

Not quite accurate. It's a loan-based system that you don't pay off until AFTER graduate and AFTER you start earning £21k/yr. It shouldn't deter anybody at all because if you don't graduate and get a good job, you don't pay it back. That's very different to the US system.

Discriminating against atheists is discriminating on the basis of religious belief.

I am quite happy to take my position from the bodies which make, define, and enforce the definitions of discrimination.

The Human Rights Commision, the police, judges, both civil and criminal, schools, hospitals, employment tribunals, local government, any other number of official bodies and charities, and the European Court of Human Rights would all pointedly and unequivocally side with me on this point. 

In any official definition, this is discrimination based on religious belief. This is not even slightly ambiguous, nor controversial. You are arguing rain isn't wet here.

I can't fathom how you think my position is bizarre, when the legal systems of the entirety of western Europe all take exactly the same position.

If you're entire argument rests on arguing that discriminating against atheists is not discriminating on the basis of religious belief, then you are unambiguously wrong. The legal definitions are utterly clear here: the only reason scouts can have this policy legally is because charities like them are exempt from the requirement to not discriminate on such basis. Its worth noting that exemption was almost removed in 2010, in which case this policy would have been illegal discrimination on the basis of religious belief.

 Legally they ARE discriminating based on religious belief. Its not in question, no matter how much you want to rant and rave about it.

Unless people do a concerted campaign to actually stop getting deliveries from companies that deal with YODEL (yes like you suggest but it isn't happening), instead of just complaining about them nothing will change.

ETA: BTW we have two different delivery systems, yodel and non yodel. I work non yodel. To get through to me custs have to press the options on their del num. So I only deal with yodel deliveries on the small number of cases were people cannot read their order number right for whatever reason. And the calls always start ""my delivery wasn't delivered blah blah"". And I just think, ""oh hey it must be a yodel del"" but I need to go through the motions anyway. I have never been wrong, it is always yodel on a call like that. People who work in the yodel dept must have 50 + calls a day dealing with complaints about how shoddy they are.

My long drawn out point is the people who make policies do not care, people wll huff and puff and complain but they will still order. For most companies it is more cost effective to use a super shit but super cheap courier and have people to man the complains about them, and even have to quite often resend high value items that have gone lost, than just use a decent company that would cost more.

&gt; Despite the revelation in Last of the Time Lords, the actual origin of the Face of Boe is still debated, with Davies himself waffling during the commentary for the episode as to whether Jack really is destined to become the Face of Boe. Producer Julie Gardner, however, has been more assertive in this regard, most recently stating outright at the 2008 San Diego Comic Con that the Face of Boe is Jack Harkness. Similarly, the Torchwood Declassified featurette from Torchwood Series 2 has John Barrowman, David Tennant and Russell T Davies stating that they believe the Face of Boe is Jack Harkness. In-universe, however, we only have Captain Jack's testimony.

true,Jimm607,null,null,"you have to assume a bit of sci-fi logic in this, in the tw episode, when jack gets blown up, he regenerates from just an arm; however each little fragment of him doesn't regenerate into a new jack, nor does it attempt to re-attach itself to jack. Now, we see the bodies of the headless monks carry on for a while, but once it passes its sell-by-date i don't think it would regenerate; rather, it would simply stay dead.

Although in the latest mini-series, jacks blood was entirely infused into another guy, which appeared to make him too immortal. So theres still the very real possibility that jacks body would also be immortal, but as far as i see by comparing the evidence, there must be some sentience there, a living, thinking part of the body must be there to regenerate, otherwise its dead weight and doesn't come back. So i guess, we need to learn a bit more about the headless monks.

My guess, this was the plan to make jack headless, the voodoo they doodoo on the heads obviously was meant to keep the head from dying, perhaps as a side effect of being forced into that state for so long in a stable state he eventually healed and settled to that state, perhaps forcing him to be like that from then onwards, a sort of temporal scar (if you don't mind sci-fi jargon) that can't be undone, the doctor apologizes a lot, jack asks if he will ever get better, the doctor gives some half-answer while secretly knowing that he won't and then either ditches him somewhere or he gets some sympathy rides in the tardis, he gets a jar built for him, they all live sort-of-happily ever after.

Please note that City Link Courier also does the same trick and is equally awful. They leave the card without attempting to deliver, sometimes they don't even bother with the card.

Third day, same thing. I rang them furiously the moment I saw the card and made them have the guy come back and actually deliver the thing.

Some people wish to post anonymously, like in the sense a wikileaks leaker would want anonymity, the kind that would withstand a court order to reveal a person behind an IP address.

Some users of Tor include the security services and law enforcement, looking to conduct investigations with separation from their actual location. So might a corporate spy.

Some dissidents, not excluding our country, we have an aggressive surveillance state in the UK, may wish to post more controversial journalism or blogging, or leak things to the press or other organisations, without the invasive bullshit the surveillance state rams down dissidents necks.

Some people just find it cool to be able to set up a completely anonymous profile, which makes no reference to their IRL persona, and with none of the anonymous persona's accounts having reference to their actual IP - to enjoy the free speech that anonymity provides.

Some people simply understand the chilling effects that would be the default state of having everything you say and do online kept at length, perhaps indefinitely if the data-mining on that data trigger off some oversensitive TerrorBot algorithm (and with warrantless access to that data i will bet they will data-mine it).

My husband and I both really enjoyed Torchwood, and I definitely like it at least *as much* as Doctor Who, but in a different way.  DW is a lot more ""fun"", Torchwood is much darker/more adult.

&gt;There is ample evidence to show that we should treat drugs as a health, not a criminal, issue

&gt;The war on drugs has failed. After four decades and one trillion dollars spent, what do we have to show for it? A global increase in drug use, drug-related crime, violence, immense suffering and millions of people in prison for non-violent crimes.

&gt;It is time we broke the taboo and opened up the debate, rather than hoping the problem will solve itself. In business, if we see one of our companies failing then we take steps to identify and solve the problem. We don’t continue failing strategies that cost huge sums of money and only exacerbate the problem. Rather than continuing on the disastrous path the war on drugs is on, we need to look at what works and what doesn’t in terms of real evidence and data.

&gt;The facts are overwhelming. If the drug trade were a country, it would have the 19th largest economy in the world. In 2005 the UN estimated that the illegal drug trade is worth more than $320 billion. If currently illegal drugs were taxed at rates comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco they would yield $46.7 billion in tax revenue. More than $51 billion is spent annually in the US on the war on drugs — roughly twice Apple’s profit in 2011.

&gt;Has this resulted in a drop in drug use? Today, a generation after President Reagan left office, the UN estimates there are 230 million drug users in the world — 90 per cent of whom are not classified as problematic. As we saw with prohibition nearly a century ago, the state banning alcohol didn’t stop people drinking — it just stopped people obeying the law.

&gt;The ballooning prison populations of the UK and US are due to drug policy. In both countries minorities are adversely affected. Sadly, one in three black men in the US will be incarcerated between the ages of 18 and 30. In the UK, there is a much higher proportion of black inmates on drug charges compared with white, despite the black community having a lower rate of drug use than whites.

&gt;In Mexico, now one of the global clearing houses for drugs, there has been a fivefold rise to more than 47,000 drug-related murders since President Calderón, who left office last week, declared his war on drugs in 2006. Juárez, Mexico’s drug trade epicentre, gained the unenviable title of the highest murder rate in the world in 2010.

&gt;Treating drugs as a health issue could save billions, improve public health and help us to control violence and crime in our communities better. Because of a lack of access to cost-effective solutions, hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost to overdose and drug-related diseases including HIV and hepatitis C.

&gt;We should be taking care of people and helping them to break their addictions rather than putting them in prison. Countries including Portugal, Switzerland and Germany have done this with remarkable results. Ten years after decriminalisation the number of people who take drugs in Portugal has halved. Nobody is prosecuted for personal possession, nobody goes to prison, people with drug problems receive professional help. When it comes to drugs, we should focus on the goals we agree on: protecting our kids, guarding public safety, and preventing and treating drug abuse and addiction.

&gt;Globally governments and the public are getting caught up in the sensational and moral aspects of drug use. Politicians have shied away from the issue as they see it as a vote loser. But the tide is turning. Eighteen states and the District of Columbia allow the medical use of marijuana, while half of Americans now support legalising marijuana and 74 per cent support alternatives to incarceration for its possession. Uruguay, Colombia, Chile, Guatemala and other Latin American countries are taking innovative steps to regulate drug use.

&gt;Nevertheless, without greater attention drug reform will continue to fall off the agenda. Earlier this year I addressed the Home Affairs Select Committee to urge them to rethink the UK’s approach. This was as part of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, which is bringing international leadership to drug reform. I became a member of the commission to help to overcome barriers to drug reform and ensure that fact-based research is widely disseminated so we can all learn from successful models and bring attention to innovative approaches.

&gt;As part of this work a new documentary, [Breaking the Taboo](http://www.breakingthetaboo.com) - narrated by Morgan Freeman and produced by my son Sam Branson’s indie Sundog Pictures — followed the commission’s attempts to break the political taboo over the war on drugs. The film exposes the biggest failure of global policy in the past 40 years and features revealing contributions from global leaders including Presidents Clinton and Carter.

&gt;If you ignore a serious problem, refuse to debate it and hope it will go away all by itself, you are very naive. The war on drugs has failed: it’s time we broke the taboo and dealt with the issue head on.",0,1354724172,null,0,1354724792,0,c7bmrbf,t3_14brvp,t1_c7bmrbf,t3_14brvp,null,1430584857,100,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,100

It's down to two primary aspects; the alcohol and the dissolved solids.

The alcohol/water phase diagram exhibits a wide liquidus/solidus gap, with the total solidification not occurring until ridiculously cold.  Thus, rather than getting a solid lump, there are thin pores in the ice, where the alcohol is freeze concentrated.  This texture supplies increased friction, over solid ice.

The dissolved solids (mostly dextrins, and proteins) do not exhibit the same pressure response proptery of ice (which melts under pressure).  Thus, they remain solid, and do not supply the thin layer of lubricant as pure water.

true,micewantpants,null,null,"A few theories I have: 

1). The Re-Use of Actor, but semi-explained with wibbly wobbly timey wimey.
You know, the Doctor never actually physically saw Oswin during that episode, only the viewers did, so maybe they really aren't the same person and Oswin didn't actually look like that and the two characters dont have anything to do with one another.
Perhaps we saw Oswin how the Doctor imagined her, and through some future Bad Wolf kind of thing, his future companion's face was put in his head for some reason? Yea, I'm probably stretching it with that one.

2) Like preggo Amy when she was plastic, Clara might have only thought that she was ""a girl named Oswin whose mind was trapped in a Dalek but thinks she is just baking souffles"" and was in fact safe-ish somewhere with the same people who stole Melody/River. He may be finding her before or after this point and there may be some episode where he ends up rescuing her future/past self from the plastic people in such a way where she wakes up and has no recollection of this ""Oswin"".

3)  He went and ran into her in her past. Eventually they both find themselves in the asylum together, she gets zapped or something and loses her memory and she either is taken from him by the Daleks, or more heart wrenching yet, he chooses to leave her behind so she can save him in her future, his past.

4) Clara is Oswin-from-another-dimension.

After blueyonder/ntl were bought out by Virgin Media the packages offered continued to rise in speed but were also oversold in many areas, signing up far more households to ""50mbps"" connections than the network could possibly manage.  

In some areas where there are less subscribers then you can still get a very good, solid and fast cable connection from Virgin but for many you'll really feel the slowdown during peak hours.  They have been slowly upgrading their network however but many areas are far too busy resulting in people paying for a high speed connection that can rarely deliver.

Doctor: Never mind.

I think we can assume there's some sort of reincarnation going on here.

I claim this reincarnation theory or something very similar. I don't see how else all this could happen, unless she's like Doctor's Daughter Jenny and can regenerate without changing, and also that she has some sort of memory loss to forget ever meeting the Doctor.

Parent comment refers to Tor, but no mention of creepy shit, and seeing Tor is primarily an anonymising proxy to the surface internet its no *creepier* than a VPN, or for that matter using nothing at all. What you choose to use it for may possibly be for criminal intent, if thats what you're ""reference"" is alluding to, but no different than any other proxy in that context.

Tor is just *one of the best* at what it does.

&gt; I was just pointing out the hypocritical rights, freedoms and privacy bullshit bandied about any time someone challenges your right to look at dodgy porn.

Wait, wait, hold up a second. So Tor is *all about* dodgy porn, is that what you're saying? The product of a non-profit organisation that receives a lot of US gov funding to provide anonymisation to dissidents and journalists, LEO's and spies, the world over, is all about dodgy porn? 

Classy putdown. Your shit completely failed to stick.

&gt; without all the hassle of a separate internet protocol and applications.

Now i know you know what you're talking about and not some dumb troll whos over-eager to show they got nuffink to hide.

The fail in your argument here is using Tor is as easy as downloading, unpacking and launching the [Tor Browser Bundle](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en). It handles everything in the background. Its literally as easy as opening firefox and going on with your anonymised and encrypted browsing, invisible to the surveillance state.

It is funny because no-one thinks they know a lot about molecular chemistry, astronomy or the history of Japan without actually studying the subject. Economics is the discipline in which everyone is an expert on, with their BS in Economics from the University of the 'Fox and Hound'. Economic ignorance, tabloid headlines and a pinch of statistical fallacies reduces people to repeating slogans like: 'Immigrants took our jobs', 'poor people should work harder' and 'rich people are job creators'. 


The problem is that such statements are hard to refute simply without a 2 hour lecture about economic history, so myths persist. One of the few areas in which people are accurately and objectively judged on their opinions is the financial markets. The stock market is always happy to embarrass those with concrete opinions like: 'prices can only go up', 'Facebook stock is a bargain' and 'This South Sea company sounds like a solid venture to put my money in'.  


For example, many regular people quit their day job in 1999, 200 and 2001 to 'day trade' and buy silly internet stocks. Almost all of them lost money, and a few lost their houses.

So did you pull that number out of your ass or do you have a shred of evidence behind it? If not then your opinion is about as worthless as recommending anonymouse.org as an anonymous proxy (it isn't anonymous, it ties *directly* to you via your IP).

&gt; then that would be a defining reason to use TOR instead.

No. It wouldn't. To proxy chain through a VM with two cheap disposeable VPN's, ones that dont require any of your details to register, ones that allow you to pay with bitcoin. There are many and hackers and criminals often go this route for speed over theoretical anonymity.

Tor is not special like your making out, you can't demonise it over any other solution. Tor is only unique in that its Free and in freedom (and is free), is decentralised, and has a darknet feature. Its impact on crime for the end-user is generally exactly the same as VPN users.

true,shadowx28,null,null,"The context is important again. Just because nothing the Doctor says can be accepted as a hard rule, doesn't mean that there aren't hard rules, or at least certain things that the Doctor feel he can't do.

Saving that family eventually led to things that HAD to occur. It could be argued that saving them as actually a fixed point. Someone needed to witness the event, to come up with the word volcano. But for arguments sake, let's just ignore that for now.

It's going to be tough here because we need to construct what is the most likely scenario of what the Doctor REALLY knew.

First, lets assume that all he is aware of is that pompeii blows up at that specific date. He has presumed knowledge of the event, and can feel it's a fixed point in time. What he doesn't know is who lives, or who dies, if anyone survives or not, and the cause of the explosion. All he knows for sure, is that it explodes and thousands die. Therefore he can save 4 people without it having a drastic effect on history. Most of that episode is a lesson to the Doctor. That it isn't always about saving everyone, only a few.

I like to think about it this way. In quantum physics particles can act as waves, until they're observed. He had never observed that event before, just that it SHOULD occur with certain parameters, and as long as those parameters are fulfilled, the fixed point doesn't essentially change. As in, before the event is observe it's a wave, after its' been observed by the Doctor (a complex time object with timelordy powers) it behaves like particles - much more rigid, specifics clearly there to see, and no longer dealing in probabilities. 

Now for TATM. The book that he receives is a message from Amy to him, with specifics about what happens. Because events are essentially observed, they aren't in flux any longer. Additionally, changing anything to do with Amy and Rory, already complex time travelers, might have bigger ramifications. Since they both have it written down in multiple locations, the Doctor is the one observing, and it's an extremely fucked up time event, it might just be too risky to save them. He could try, and possibly succeed, but at what cost? 


Sorry that was pretty convoluted, din't have much time to type it all up and it's quite a bit. Please point out any mistakes and the like, I'll try to clear up whatever I meant!

For instance caffein, sugar and painkillers have done nothing but good for the world and they all have varying effects on one's mental state and physical state.

Another thing worth pointing out is the view that alcohol and clubbing is is just a vehicle for people to let out emotions they already have. Personally I'm of this opinion. I seldom ever drink and I haven't smoke marijuana in I think over a year, maybe longer. It's just not my sort of thing. However when I do go to a party and drink it's lots of fun. I let my self lose control a little because acting as a perfectly civilised, sinless being is near impossible. Every one has to have a break and for many many many people, partying and alcohol is a good way to do that. There are other ways to do but alcohol is probably the easiest and in many ways is very effective.

But that's all assuming that you think people should be kept away from certain substance for their own benefit. Which I'm personally not of. I think other people have no place telling me what I can and can't do if I'm not harming any one else. But that arguments been spouted out more times than any one cares to remember.

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"&gt;as I'm more than a little convinced that RTD didn't really know his Doctor Who, or at least...Not as much as Moffat.

Well, that's garbage. Did Pip and Jane Baker ""know"" *their* *Doctor Who*? Did they know their *Doctor Who* better than Andrew Cartmel knew his? Did John-Nathan Turner? Did Terrance Dicks? Malcolm Hulke? Barry Letts? 

There's no *one* single *Doctor Who*, there never has been. By definition, there can't be. Russell T. Davies' *Doctor Who* is as much *Doctor Who* as Steven Moffat's *Doctor Who* is *Doctor Who*, much as I dislike Moffat's *Doctor Who*. Much as I dislike Moffat's *Doctor Who*, I can't say he doesn't ""get"" it or doesn't ""know"" it, because he's the guy actually coming up with the stories. Hell, he knows it better than I do.

&gt;It's....reasonably well established, thanks to previous TV serious, radio plays and books that the foundation of Gallifreyan society is based upon that of three timelords that Rebuilt Timelord society out of the ruins of the previous dynasty - they are know as The Other, Omega and Rassilon.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think The Other was ever mentioned in the TV show. Rassilon and Omega, definitely, but the Other was solely the purview of the off-screen media.

&gt;The problem with this, is that RTD kind of shot the show in the proverbial foot with this whole ""time war/time lock"" nonsense...

Considering Davies had to revive a franchise with a mythology that spanned 26 years, but keep the story running, the Time War was the best - probably the only - way to wipe the slate clean without entirely starting over. I mean, he had to reintroduce *Doctor Who* to a brand new audience, some of whom had never even heard of the show. He couldn't bring the Time Lords and the Daleks back en masse in Series 1 Episode 1.

&gt;not all Gallifreyans become Timelords - The Doctor is a Gallifreyan, and it is something I wish Moffat would reintroduce as a concept and reinforce this idea).

You could almost say Moffat doesn't *really* know his *Doctor Who* :P

&gt;Nu Who fans wouldn't be aware of this, as it hasn't been explained in any way, shape or form, but Gallifreyans don't in fact reproduce in a sexual sense, in the way that Humans understand it.

Classic Who fans won't be aware of that, either. I don't think the show ever went into detail about Gallifreyan sexual practices. It certainly never dealt with anything in *Lungbarrow*. I'm all for off-screen media forging its own path, but off-screen media has little to no bearing on the direction of the TV show. There are exceptions, of course - both ""Dalek"" and ""Rise of the Cybermen""/""The Age of Steel"" were influenced by audio plays - but there is no conceivable way a future executive producer is going to say that the Doctor is traveling with his Loom, or whatever. 

If and when the show wants to deal with the 13th problem, I don't see whoever's in charge at the time reaching into something as obscure as *Lungbarrow* just because it offers a possible solution. Maybe River will give the Doctor a new set of regenerations. Maybe the Time Lords will return and bestow him a new set of regenerations. Maybe this, maybe that. But I can't even imagine a scenario where the executive producer decides to use an out-of-print book, unfamiliar to ... what, 70% of the general fandom, with things that haven't even been discussed in the TV show, to answer a question that hasn't been mentioned in the seven years that *Doctor Who* has been back on air.

That's exactly the reason why the episode The End of the World, the very first adventure of the ninth doctor and Rose, showed the destruction of earth, because that contradicts the episode The Ark from 1966, where the destruction of earth was shown in an entirely different way. Same for the cracks from season 5, or the flashback to the young master from the [Sound of Drums](http://i.imgur.com/W1ayk.jpg), or when Sarah Jane said she never saw the doctor again after he left her, even though they met in The Five Doctors and multiple extended media.

When Russel wrote the end of time he allowed Moffat to decide whether the timelords should return or whether they should stay timelocked, and Moffat said the timelords should stay where they were, because he's not interested in writing for them, so I doubt we'll see them again during his time on the show at least. If a future showrunner is interested in bringing back the timelords he just has to write a story where the timelords return somehow, whether using a plot device introduced in an older story or something entirely new, I don't care, Moffat certainly didn't waste too much time when he brought back the dalek empire.",0,1354738446,null,0,false,0,c7br6g7,t3_14bo3g,t1_c7br6g7,t3_14bo3g,null,1430588179,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

Leading to users purchasing from some sort of authority that can monitor their usage and allow for taxation.

Besides from that there is also the point that there are drugs that I would consider far less damaging than alcohol that are illegal, which seem to be so just from a point of ignorance.

And yes the question of abuse (and how alcohol is abused) is a good one, however I think it is more of a societal problem rather than a substance specific one.

true,SpottieOttieDopalis,lfc68,,"As you can tell from the chart Suarez is converting right around 12% of his chances with 10 goals and IIRC his conversion rate was 6% last year. One of the main reasons why his chance conversion rate is so low is because Suarez is [currently 4th in chances created in the EPL](http://d3j5vwomefv46c.cloudfront.net/photos/large/695696473.png?key=651516&amp;Expires=1354739130&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIYVGSUJFNRFZBBTA&amp;Signature=ZBIDwENn7gssPV4ri4yaAk7zhpfym7JHPoQ8V2KsOaz4lBCECbJeY9jT0SNri7ossnI11aVXAL-B7~5Mq3xByyjVzFlA8KdKeVHbN9bJjwCrPxjwEzz29q1xG~cct7vDpCGbB9z5qlDaJlEoQhZvjvBrfldVBz477bLvP0DjIJM_). His clear cut chance conversion rate actually [isn't that bad this year](http://cdn.eplindex.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Defoe.png), it could be better though, but as you can tell he creates a ridiculous amount of opportunities for himself, averaging a shot every 20 minutes and a total of 69 shots so far.

This all further highlights what has been our biggest problem for the past 2 years, finishing our chances. Suarez creates a ridiculous amount for a striker, but we need him and the team to become a little more clinical in front of goal. Hopefully Borini comes back soon and the January transfers, whoever the are, can help us take those chances better.

The majority of all the people who are in prison for drug related crimes (less than 10,000 people in this country - about 12% of all people in prison) are there because of dealing or possession with intent to deal.  I'm sure some of these people will set up businesses if drugs were legalised, but I'm sure many of them prey on the weak and they'll just find another way of doing this.

1. The use of powers is still minimal and rarely central to the plot. It's a lot like series 3 in that it's basically a teenage drama with the occasional power use sprinkled in to remind you that they have them. 

2. Lacking in an overall plot arc, both within the season and in terms of setting up something that would extend past this season. The only thing that comes to mind extending past a single episode is Alex's plot arc, and that's more humorous than suspenseful. 

My hope is that they're basically using this season like Season 1, to set up the characters raport with each other and have them do some basic bonding as a team before they jump into heavier plot stuff with future seasons. I also hope they bring back Seth to switch things up eventually and give them powers they can actually make use of to drive the plot.

true,SteveMcQwark,canada,Ontario,"There are many questions around that. For example, does the office of the Queen include succession to that office, or merely its roles and responsibilities? Also, succession may not even be part of the law of Canada. The Act of Settlement isn't listed as part of the Constitution, and the Constitution indicates that Canada is under the Crown of the United Kingdom, and merely grants authority to the Queen in that context rather than constituting the office. The Statute of Westminster only grants legislative authority to Canada over legislation insofar as it is part of the law of Canada, and it seems to indicate in the preamble that succession is, by constitutional convention, not part of the law of any one realm. This is supported by the fact that it set out a procedure for changing succession. If succession were part of the law of Canada, provisions in the Act itself would have rendered this redundant. This leaves succession under the sole authority of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, but requiring, by convention, that the Parliaments of the other realms assent to any changes. Whether there is a similar convention requiring provincial assent as well is a bit of an unknown. It would be interesting to see this referred to the Supreme Court of Canada. Of course, conventions aren't justiceable, but things get sticky politically if they aren't followed, so its nice if they can be authoritatively set out so that everyone knows where they stand.",0,1354741727,null,0,1354742076,0,c7bsc2e,t3_149n5r,t1_c7bsc2e,t1_c7bkie0,null,1430588717,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

2. Transduction barrier which prohibits any Timelord from going back in time or to the future of Gallifray. It also forces every Timelord to live synchronously in respect to one an other (this does not mean Timelords can't cross their own timelines though)

3. The Doctor has a cot. He said it was his own. Although he could have lied...could have been of his kids/grandkids... 

4. Why would they do this? They can come up with much easier and more sustainable storylines than this. This loops back, that's not good for a show that intends to run for decades to come.

5. The Doctor is a traveler, an explorer at heart. He isn't one to sit around on a singular planet and do something as mundane as building a society. He would get bored *so* fast that it's simply not believable.

6. Gallifreyans CAN reproduce sexually, it's just that they have an EXTREMELY low fertility rate due to the curse placed upon them from the Dark Times.

He has to make the choice whether or not to destroy Pompeii.  It is a fixed point, so that is not really a choice.  All is well and good, and the Doctor can save hos sanity.

Then Donna tells him to save the family.  Okay, if he saves the family, why not the family next door?  How about the one across the street?  That guy with the fruit cart?  Obviously he must be saved as well.  Where does it end?  If no one dies there, then it is no longer a disaster, but a miracle.  One that religions are started over (as hinted at the end).  

Okay, so he allows himself top save just this one family.  Why not just one Time Lord?

The doctor lies to comfort himself, just as much as the companion.  There are certain things where a mass amount of people must die.  In the case of the Time Lords and the Citizens of Pompeii, and the Jews during WW2, he has the power, but he cannot use it to save himself guilt.

Amy made her peace with her choice.  She wrote it down, and delivered it to the doctor.  She made sure he knew not to worry about potentially destroying the universe again, as she was happy.

* One of David Luiz or Hazard for **MOTM**.

* Chelsea finding their flow back going forward?

* David Luiz was passing like a God.

* Cech is a penalty saving God.

* Is the situation really so bad that fans have to leave at the 72nd minute? Even when the team is finally playing well and scoring on free will?

* **Happy to see Paulo again!!! Best moment of the game. Kudos Rafa.** 

* Torres scoring two goals changes nothing in terms of what I think about him at the moment, but now he has something to build on.

* Should David Luiz be restored to the starting XI?

* Torres rabona was sexy. 

* The fans at the Bridge tonight are really embarrassing but that's my own opinion. How spoiled do you have to be to leave just because Chelsea were slowly but steadily going out (fans leaving at 70th minute and throughout), or just going completely silent after 0-1 to Juve? I would have given so much for an opportunity to be there, and I would've sung till my lungs would pop out of my mouth. I am really pissed off because of this, embarrassing.

The reason?

For some reason they delivered in the local area last, because there were no local delivery drivers working (yes for over 10 days) they simply didn't get anyone to deliver it.

I got a refund from Amazon and Amazon said they would get Yodel to return the package.

About 3 or 4 days before Christmas the intercom for my flat goes. Guess what...it's Yodel attempting to deliver the package which was supposed to have been returned to Amazon

2. The Face of Boe, when first introduced, does not recognize the Doctor or is *really, extremely* convincing at acting like he does not, for which he really has no motive to do.
3. The Face of Boe is a ""Boekind"" and refers to others of his species, though he is the last one left.
4. The Face of Boe is telepathic. How would Jack Harkness reasonably obtain these powers? 
5. The Face of Boe has crazy tentacle things instead of hair. Also, his head is *enormously* large and his facial structure isn't remotely similar to Jack's (yeah, yeah, millions of years, blah, blah).

7. The whole Professor Yana incident is a huge paradox if Jack is the Face of Boe (Jack is involved in the event; millions of years later, he tells the Doctor about Yana, who brings Jack to the event).
