When you have parents who are out of work, and see no point in trying to succeed then that culture of hopelessness rubs off on the children (who are also materially suffering as despite what the Mail says, benefits are hardly a princely sum) and the parents simply won't or can't help their children with schoolwork and engage with them.

true,tgjer,davison,Davison,"Depends on what your personal canon is.

Back in the day, the First Doctor was originally imagined as literally an old alien man traveling with his biological granddaughter, who was presumably born in the usual fashion to one of the Doctor's own kids.

Then when the Doctor started getting younger and hanging out with attractive young women he wasn't related to, to keep the censors off their back the writers implemented the No Sex On The TARDIS rule. They wrote the Doctor to be varying degrees of asexual, or at least disinterested. Then in the 80's and 90's some of the books and radio dramas claimed that Time Lords were completely asexual, and reproduced via genetic looms. So I guess they probably could have a kid together, but it would be a pretty mechanical process. But maybe they'd both have to be native Gallifreyan for that to work, idk.

Then the 1996 movie had the Doctor claiming to be half-human on his mother's side, though it's not clear if he was joking or not. So if that's taken literally it wouldn't even matter that River has some human DNA.

And now the writers seem to have retconned the Doctor from presumed-asexual to mostly-inactive-omnisexual, ignored the ""half human"" stuff, and gone back to assuming the Doctor had children and grandchildren that weren't grown on looms.

So... maybe? I think the writers are leaning in that direction now, anyway. I don't think they will, but they probably could.",0,1329426826,null,0,false,0,c3ryfd6,t3_pss0v,t1_c3ryfd6,t3_pss0v,null,1428366540,14,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,14

This is a troll right?

A small minority of students leave school unable to do those tasks, a very small minority. Likewise a few decades a go it would also have been a very small minority that would have left school unable to do them, but probably a larger minority.

In general, education has massively improved - it's just that the increasing educational demands of the modern workplace show up the flawed cases more than the old industrial workplace did and also you were probably somewhat unaware of the failures when you were at school, if you didn't go to a secondary modern you probably wouldn't even have seen them at all.

Devils' advocate - I believe that some protesters, including one who owns a gardening business and others who have experience in that line of work, offered to carry out the work for nothing. If that's true (widely reported, on the BBC too (means it's legit!)), then they've been ignored or refused and at cost to the taxpayer. It was also initially estimated to cost £100,000, then £20,000.

Take X. X identifies as a *Doctor Who* fan. David Tennant is his favorite version of the Doctor. He's got the bowtie, the sonic screwdriver, River's diary, the t-shirt of the Weeping Angels and the Silence facing off. He cosplays at every science fiction convention, every*Doctor Who* Exhibition. Every other Facebook status update is a paraphrase of a *Doctor Who* episode to describe how he's feeling (i.e. ""it's a wibbley-wobbley kind of day"", ""I wish I could exterminate my boss""). 

X fancies himself a bit of a writer. He's working on a short story about the adventures of Rose Tyler and the half-human Doctor clone in the alternate universe. 

Mention the classic series to X, however, and his eyes glaze over. His mind wanders. He shifts from one foot to the other, he checks his smartphone (with a TARDIS background) hoping for a distraction in the conversation, he checks his *Doctor Who*-themed watch, before finally admitting that he doesn't really care about the classic series. All he knows of it is that it's old, the Doctors wore weird costumes, and the aliens looked funny. 

""But you're a *Doctor Who* fan!"" I tell X. ""You tell people that your favorite TV show is almost 50 years old, but you've got no interest in the pre-2005 episodes?""

""Not really,"" says X with a shrug. ""I love the new series, though! River Song is *hot*!""

To which I reply ""I WILL BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN WITH YOU STILL INSIDE IT.""

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"&gt;In terms of deciding whether she is legally allowed to hold office, it is ignored entirely. There should be no barriers in place to exclude religious people from holding office, not should there be any specific privelidges for religious organisations.

I'm not entirely clear on your point, but then I might be mistaken in looking for something beyond the stating of the obvious. Really; what other case could there possibly be?

&gt;That is entirely different from a privately run newspaper from publishing things about a person as they have nothing to do with the way the country is governed.

Not a distinction you've made previously, so I'm not sure how that's relevant. You said 'secularists', not 'secularists in government'.

&gt;However as a general principle I see no problem with the discussion of the ways that a particular candidates faith might affect the way that they would represent their constituents, provided that there are no specific restrictions or advantages for a candidate that are specific to their religious beliefs.

So 'anything goes'? There are no limits to what's reasonable, what's sensible? What's relevant to the political process?

What hypocrisy. So the Daily Mail could run an article about some Islamic ministerial candidate over how they would probably force everyone to follow Shia law, and that's fine? Newspaper's such as the Guardian who should know better, who in most other issues hold themselves to a higher standard, can publish guesswork over a candidates beliefs without interviewing them, or hint at their connection with right-wing American fundamentalists without actually demonstrating any, and this is 'discussion' rather then 'smear'?

What hypocrisy. We're posting in a topic with 'clear thought and logic' in the title; when has such obvious prejudice been associated with either?

I don't have much sympathy for Warsi or her daft remarks, or would even notice if all the lords spiritual were thrown out. But if a persons religious beliefs can be so massively distorted and used against them in an election without anyone caring, then maybe she has a point about the dangers of 'militant secularism' to our democracy.",0,1329432304,null,0,false,0,c3rzjrl,t3_pozeq,t1_c3rzjrl,t1_c3rsa6h,null,1428367073,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,ramirodt,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"I'm Argentinean, and I have not heard any convincing argument so far for Argentina's sovereignty claim.  But here's what I know about what it's normally said:

The islands were Argentinean for about 13 years, between 1820 and 1833.  There were Argentine settlers (approx. 60) when the British took the islands, lowered the flag and deported them.  

Despite the fact that the Falklands were forcefully taken by Britain (one of Argentina's arguments) this is not a valid claim -to me- in this day and age, because 180 years have gone by, and given that all the land in the world at some more or less recent past was taken by force, the only reasonable thing after some time is to respect the will of the inhabitants of a patch of land.
Against this argument (self determination) I've also heard jokes like if Large parts of East London were going to be rightfully given to Pakistan soon :)

The other argument commonly heard in Argentina is the one of the ""continental platform""; the islands are within Argentina's continental platform and that is a criteria that is often used internationally, despite the existence of many exceptions to this rule (which is not simple proximity).  What it is said is that most exceptions are also the remains of colonialist empires (Cannary Islands from Spain in front of Morocco, French islands close to Africa, Gibraltar also in dispute, etc.).

In short, I am terribly sorry about the Muppets we chose for politicians, and how they resort to the ""low hanging fruit"" of claiming the Falklands every time there's local trouble they need to cover up.
Our ability to choose politicians could definitely use some improvement.  

But the UK should know by now, that it's only a political scheme to win legislative elections in 2013 (normally called ""sabre rattling"" in the UK), that is a lot closer to a political marketing campaign than a to be a real threat.  I don't think the government of CFK even cares about the islands, it's just a load of bullocks for the campaign coming next year.
IMHO, the UK should know this and COMPLETELY ignore the idiotic and shameful ""sabre rattling"" that is going on right now in Argentina; otherwise (sending the war ships) the UK is just entering the game and even contributing in the continuation of this embarrassing crap that I honestly hope to see finished as soon as possible.

The only thing the UK is doing wrong is comparing the current situation to 1982 ignoring the context.  Back then an illegal war was started by a jerk dictator, the situation is very far from that now and the risk of belic action started by Argentina is naught.

On another note, the wish of the Falklanders is excessively convenient for them presently and Britain will have to deal with it sooner or later.  The chaps do not want to be independent, they want to be owned by someone, namely the UK, but keep their own independence as an overseas territory.  Hence, if they find the oil, it's their's to keep, not the UK's.  If English people want to go there to work they need authorisation, but not vice versa (Falklanders can freely go into the UK).  When they need help, the UK has to spend a lot of precious taxpayers' money deploying expensive war ships to the Islands.  So the UK isn't getting much out of the deal to me, quite the contrary.  At some point in time they should become integral part of the UK or be independent altogether.

My 2¢.

TL;DR our politicians are tossers (and most footballers too); but not all Argentineans are :)

true,MrJustinD,null,null,"Hi, Jon from BBC America.

I definitely thought I should contact you. Last year, I created a show called The Professor: Improv Inspired By Doctor Who. After two test shows at one theater, the show was booked for a six-week run with a full cast at a new theater in South Austin called The Institution Theater. We sold out the majority of our hour-long shows and gained a quick following. On March 23 of this year, we'll begin an eight-show run, every Friday and Saturday night, until April 14. You can see our Facebook page here (https://www.facebook.com/TheProfessorImprov). The cast I put together for this show is a mix between people who are long-time fans of Doctor Who, new fans who came on when the show came back with Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor (including myself), and people who had never seen an episode before. One amazing effect of being in the cast and having to do research is that the cast members who have never seen Doctor Who before are now avid fans and often make specific references to the show. Just the other day during rehearsal, I was running the cast through an improv exercise and when someone finished with a short monologue, one of those new fans said rather nonchalantly, ""That's the first question.""

We'd love to be featured in your documentary, and please let us know if there's any way I can help with your project.

Thanks,

Something I love about 4: he originated the sudden throaty ""*Wellllll.*"" that means the Doctor is about to contradict himself. Now its part of the characters heritage -- one of the little signs the other actors use to show it's the same person with a different persona!

However there are many times in an organisation when there is just enough work that it would be nice to have an extra body to help out but not enough that there is a business case to actually create another job. 

The idea is supposed to be to give people who are at risk of becoming unemployable work experience. Even if it's just making the tea and fetching stationary, getting them out of the house and into a normal work environment for a few hours a week is going to do them some good.

Just off the top of my head, one possible way to prevent orgs from taking the piss would be to limit the amount of labour they are allowed to use in a given time period. A small office for example might be allowed to have one person working 10 hours a week for no more than 13 weeks in 6 months. This would prevent them from simply replacing the worker every 3 months, so if they need someone they would have to create a job.

I don't know how well the above suggestion would work as I have just pulled it out of my arse. But at least I've actually spent a few minutes thinking about how this scheme could properly be regulated, which clearly the people currently in charge of it have neglected to do. As a result we have a system that one might almost suspect of having been designed to exploit the poor for the benefit of big business.

Oh yeah and end the practice of actually paying companies to take on unpaid staff. That's just obscene.

There is absolutely no contradiction in requiring claimants to perform the work for which they are capable in order to receive their benefits.  The spokesman from the National Association of Welfare Rights Advisers stated: ""a growing, publicly funded, unpaid workforce ... [is] immoral""




Firstly - if the claimants are receiving benefits then they're not unpaid (so ""unlimited unpaid work"" is disingenuous).  Secondly - working to the level to which you are capable is moral and highly beneficial to health/wellbeing, and there is a *huge* variety of disability; many people are suitable to a limited amount of work but unemployable for a full-time job.




This all comes down to how well the fitness-to-work assessments are carried out.  This is an incredibly important and difficult assessment, so government should be making sure they get it absolutely right... http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/jul/24/atos-faces-critical-report-by-mps




Oh.  400,000 appeals, 39% of which are successful.  That's a bit shit.  And when they use ambiguous questions like ""Do you shop and cook for yourself?"" to assess disability, that's pretty piss-poor.





So it's very important to recognise that it's the piss-poor quality of fitness-to-work assessments that is the issue here.

Saying that, while I support the nuclear technology proposed in principle, I have some serious issues with the way their being run.

Did you know that the plans for disposal of waste of the new generation of plants is being paid for by calculating the cost of disposal of high level waste in 2030, then working backwards, investing a tiny fraction of the money in the stock market now, then hoping that it will grow the pot of money in time. It's fucking disgraceful. It's basically saying 'fuck you 2030 taxpayers, you deal with the mess'. That's one trick they used to make nukes seem cheap compared to, say, the Severn Barrage. Oh and they only looked at the electricity produced by the barrage over a 25 year period (to make the comparisons between nukes equal), there's nothing to say a barrage wouldn't produce energy for 100 years of more.

It's not called Road Tax.

It's now called VED, and is an emission tax. A great deal of drivers do not have to pay for it (if their car is low emission, or just very old).

It does NOT pay for the roads, it is just another form of general taxation that goes straight to the treasury like most other taxes. Nothing is ringfenced. Most roads within town boundaries is the responsibility of the council and with some treasury assistance is largely paid for from council tax.

""Not paying for the roads"" is a regular stick used to bash cyclists with, and I find it bizarre that almost 75 years after it was abolished, many people STILL seem to believe they pay 'road tax', and that the tax is specifically ringfenced for spending on the roads.

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"The retirement issue is a tricky one.

The pension system is based on the assumption that a working man paying in 10% of his salary for 40 years, he can maintain the same lifestyle after retirement for a further 4 years.

(These are very simplistic calculations and assume any interest accrued on the amount is cancelled out by inflation).

Which is all very well if everyone dies on or before their 69th birthday.

Bearing in mind when the pension scheme started in 1910, the average life expectancy was about 50, so many people paying in never even made a return on their contributions. The system was solvent.

Compare that to today, where the average life expectancy is about 75, and all their contributions are ""used up"" by 69. Who has to make up the shortfall ?

The pension scheme right now is a Ponzi scheme of the first order. People paying into it now are funding the pensions of the currently retired, and more money is going out than can possibly come in.

So the only solution is to raise the pensionable age, so people make more contributions and less deductions. But that has a knock on effect on the unemployed youth, as there are less jobs to go around.

To my mind, any company that find itself paying more than 40 hours a week overtime (either to a single individual or to a group) should stop that and make a new position for a new worker.

Overtime is paid at a higher rate (usually) than basic hours, so it costs them more money to pay 40 hours overtime than 40 hour basic salary.

As the article says, Hazard's biggest priority is to get matches. Since he normally plays wide left for Lille, I worry that this is foreshadowing a departure... most likely Bale. Now, I know Hazard is capable of playing through the middle and on the right too, meaning he could possibly provide competition for Lennon (especially when you consider the way the wingers are allowed to interchange and go where they please at Tottenham). But it is concerning, especially for the price we'll have to pay for him.

A 30 month driving ban, and an extended retest at the end of it is probably the end of his career as a bus driver; bus companies typically require you to have no more than 3 points on your licence and no unspent criminal convictions, whereas he will have to declare this offence for 7 years. 

He's therefore going to have to pay for his PCV training and test himself, including hiring a bus to do the test in, if he wants to go back to being a bus driver - realistically, that's beyond the resources of someone who's just been released from jail.

On top of that, many bus companies will outright reject him for this criminal conviction, until it's spent - it's just not worth the risk of publicity, when there are plenty of decent unemployed people who'll happily take PCV training if the bus company pays for it, with a view to a long-term job.

So, his sentence is effectively:

 * 6 to 17 months in jail, depending on his behaviour in that time.
 * 30 months ban from driving at all.
 * Extended retest to regain his licence at the end of those 30 months.
 * End of career as a bus driver.
 * Long term difficulty finding a job - the jail sentence will have to be declared every time he applies for a job in the next 7 years, and as long as unemployment remains high, an employer is always going to prefer the guy without the criminal past.",0,1329480848,null,0,false,0,c3s5zqv,t3_pto98,t1_c3s5zqv,t1_c3s5lao,null,1428370154,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

Obviously I don't know the entire case, but it does highlight the very real low valuation that the legal system puts on life. This is and isn't cherry picking, there was another example of a kid how got six months for taking/handling 3 bottles of water. But argument by example should be frowned upon, principle is more important and for such a severe event justice seems absent in the local case, and from looking at similar recent traumatic events. I can only speculate why: it was a quasi-public servant, he used a car as a weapon (explained later), and probably had the backing of a private legal team paid by his employer.

The insight in this case is how vehicular crime gets special treatment, he was not charged with attempted murder, but dangerous driving and GBH. [The car](http://www.iankitching.me.uk/articles/death-driving.html) as a weapon has historically seen much judicial leniency. [2k will die, about 25k will be seriously injured, and there will be 200k casualties per year in the UK alone](http://www.dft.gov.uk/statistics/releases/road-accidents-and-safety-quarterly-estimates-q3-2011/), and this is accepted due to the otherwise impact on commerce. Compare the attention it receives to the likes of  terrorism (~0) or [swine flu (~100 deaths)](http://www.dft.gov.uk/statistics/releases/road-accidents-and-safety-quarterly-estimates-q3-2011/).

But thank you for accidentally proving my point. Even though there was intent, real serious harm, premeditation, I mean I have to commend the driver on his driving ability in this regard, you feel it acceptable putting 'causing mayhem' and 'stealing [another's] stuff' into a more severe category than near death. That is bizarre if you think about what prison should be for: neutralising threats, and a man that can't contain his temper is the most pertinent case. 

Having said that I'm not advocating more jail time, I would be happy for a life driving BAN, then put the 60k for prison to work helping the injured man, perhaps even some appropriate 'maintenance allowance' over a long time.

However, I do know that I will support Chelsea when they face Napoli, and if the draw would have been Arsenal-Napoli I would probably have cheered for Arsenal. I also cheered for Manchester United and Manchester City (even though douche-bag Balotelli played, but England still needs Joe Hart on form for the Euros) yesterday.

For a start, that is disingenuous. Of the millions that were unemployed, only a relatively small number were considered long term unemployed, the rest was just the typical churn of short-term unemployed, ie people between jobs. 

Secondly, even during the boom years there weren't enough jobs to go around. The increase in employment was mostly met by immigration. Sure, there is a debate to be had over why immigrants were more able to get the work, but that does not change the fact that they kept labour supply artificially high.

As to that debate, there are many factors involved. No small part was prejudice against native workers. It isn't the case that all native workers are lazy or inferior workers when compared eastern EU immigrants, but the constant repetition of the claim (based on nothing more than anecdote) was enough to make employers discriminate against their own countrymen.

I very rarely believe that there is only ever a binary choice, in fact there is always at least a third option: 'I don't know' should always be an acceptable response. How about a fourth: it is not for me to decide? 

&gt; They are, however, political choices that I wouldn't trust the voters to be sufficiently informed to make a proper decision.

I really feel we have to get over this. Firstly it can't be anymore dysfunctional than the current system, and second it is a self fulfilling prophecy. Without the room to exercise a political consciousness how can it ever develop? People can neither internalise responsibility nor own the consequences, blame is easily externalised through the societal or political witch figure out the day. If I was being particularly combative I would say this same logic was found in the justification of the whip and chain: blacks and their lack of civilisation meant they couldn't de trusted around white women.

Of course the Scottish parliament can pass legislation to hold a referendum, and of course, the UK government could try and go to court to prevent such legislation being passed. However, they'd look pretty foolish taking (undemocratic) court action when the SNP were democratically elected with a massive mandate to hold a referendum (in legal terms, it'd be interesting to see if a court would be willing to rule against a democratically elected body doing what it was elected to do). I suspect any such court action would also galvanise the people of Scotland to vote yes in any referendum. It'd be entirely counterproductive and this report demonstrates that Westminster is singularly failing to understand the issues.

When the Scottish government holds its referendum in 2014, in the event of a yes vote, the outcome of the referendum will NOT immediately be an independent Scotland, it'll merely mark the beginning of negotiations for secession. This is because the whole ""legal and binding"" bullshit is just that - a complete smokescreen. Referenda in the UK are rarely ""legal and binding"" (the Tories could quite legally have ignored the AV referendum had they not got the result they wanted). The SNP proposals are for an advisory referendum (just like the AV one) - it's essentially a mass opinion poll. The point is that it's *politically* impossible to ignore, and that's why they're banging on about legality. Legally speaking, there's no obligation to do anything, and it's entirely possible that you could get a 99% yes vote for independence, and nothing happen at all. Very unlikely, but certainly possible.

As for devo-max, a federal UK would make a lot of sense (and certainly satisfy a lot of people in Scotland). It's interesting that the Lib Dems are all in favour of federalism, and extending the franchise to 16 year olds - except for the Scottish referendum, of course.

Rather than blather on meaninglessly about legality and the role of the Electoral Commission, the Lords - Westminster - needs to explain why Scottish MPs can vote on English-only issues like the NHS reforms. That's a ridiculous situation, and as I understand it, the only party that doesn't vote on English-only issues in Westminster is the SNP. Labour and the Lib Dems need to explain why their MPs vote on issues that won't affect their constituents.

true,Crabalicious,null,null,"&gt;Apparently seceding states don't inherit their EU membership and need to reapply

Probable, but it's also debatable, apparently. Even if it were the case Scotland had to reapply, it's unlikely to be an issue since it's already been a member as part of the UK and meets all the legal and economic entrance criteria. Who's going to veto membership? It might be attractive to think the UK might do so out of spite, but trade is more important at the end of the day, and there are ways Scotland can make life extremely difficult for the UK too (I'm thinking specifically of refusing to allow Trident to remain in Scottish waters which would cost the UK government tens of billions of pounds to relocate). 

Regardless, Scotland might not want to be a member of the EU - they might prefer to be like Norway.

With regards to the currency issue, there's no real precedent so it's impossible to tell. I would think the EU would find it hard to insist Scotland took on the Euro as a new member state given the current climate (though who knows what it'll be like in four or five years time when it's actually an issue). Sweden, for example, doesn't have an opt-out of the Euro (like Denmark and the UK do), satisfies the criteria, but doesn't use it, so despite the fact that new states are supposed to take it on, there are existing states breaking the rule.

A fair point - but I'd argue that those options do little more to further the investigation than abstaining from voting. The more options available, the more difficult it is to ensure neutrality.

&gt; If I was being particularly combative I would say this same logic was found in the justification of the whip and chain: blacks and their lack of civilisation meant they couldn't de trusted around white women.

Please don't place a straw-man in what was otherwise a perfectly acceptable argument. If it is left wholly to the public, issues of (e.g.) defence, of national borders, and of internal policing will be decided on emotive factors rooted in pride and not logic - because that is how public mentality works. If it wasn't, one wouldn't need to ponder the wording of referenda because they would be able to independently make their own mind up in the first place.

How, for example, is the average voter to garner sufficient information about the logistics of border defence in order to make a grounded decision as to whether to share the burden or have individual forces? Or to know what the long term impact of the sharing of natural resources will be on economic growth? Policy decisions such as those are left to those with advisors and the time to consider all of the options for a reason. This isn't about talking down to the public, it's about recognising that those sorts of decisions are best left to those with the time and expertise to consider how to get the best result from the huge range of potential outcomes.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's not really a strawman argument if you consider both cases class a set of people less worthy of privilege, in this case the right to self determination. I'm not saying you advocate slavery, but the two points lie at opposite ends of the same scale. There is a very similar logic and I do feel Victorian 'democracy' will be one of those things looked back on by future generations with raised eyebrows, just like a woman's right to vote, land ownership outside the gentry, or the weight of one's vote not being measured in numbers of employees owned.

&gt; ... pride and not logic ...

If anything the wigs and the Crown is where the conceit begins; money doesn't trickle down but a particular ignorance, bad faith and self-entitlement certainly do. Public opinion is almost always manufactured, and when that fails in cases like the Iraq war, simply ignored. I don't think any child is born worshipping Alex Ferguson and hating anything in a light blue shirt. Opinion doesn't 'work', it is worked, and why? Because access to the tools of society are completely privatised: the media, the monetary system, the military, the legal system, and access to the key educational institutions that provide the stock deemed worthy of politics.

To move back to the voting system, there is no pre-requisite for representatives to be competent at anything other then generating sufficient public opinion and not being offensive enough to the incumbent economic powers to warrant some kind of public shaming, party ostracising, or financial pulling-of-the-plug. These proxies then vote because the public cannot be trusted to vote correctly, but that means the elected cannot be trusted either. Okay then, let's apply another round of the same logic: the people don't have sufficient political, ethical or technical insight to determine who is worthy of election so let us install a dictatorship. ('Got off your darn straw-horse' I hear you say, but I'll again claim a difference of scale, or at least an arbitrary line.) You seem to have cast aside your peers and put you faith in what you hope is a benevolent ruling class.

l'm all for expertise, but as advisors. Direct democracy for me wouldn't be about micro-management, like how many gun turrets do we want where, but it would be nice to set the principles we favour defensive solutions rather than offensive, or at least have some sort of government kill switch to press if a feral government keeps dragging you into endless wars on everything, from immigrants, muslims, cannabis, to single mothers. 

People feel helpless, because they are helpless, mostly reduced to running round playing with the latest distraction like man-children deemed unworthy of playing with the grownup toys. Those that aren't easily conned by iPhones, the promise of fame, or prats on ice, are left throwing tantrums (easily kettled) or begging for change. Whilst we are on our knees, at least we haven't expended any further energy as we receive the shafting. I want to vote directly on every law that will affect me (ACTA being the most recent example), I don't know how that would be controversial. I wan't to instigate an outing of any public official if they show gross misconduct, I want communities with the power to say 'no we do not need a fifth Tescos in the village'.

I understand where you're coming from, but given the way our legal system works, I'd rather not separate out GBH into two or more offences. If you're not very careful, you end up in a situation where the CPS almost always prosecutes for the lesser offence, which results in people who deserve a hefty sentence not being charged with the more serious offence. In turn, the presence of the more serious offence drives down sentences for GBH, as judges tend to assume that you would have been charged with the more serious offence if it was appropriate.

In this case, 17 months jail and a 30 month driving ban with extended retest seems reasonable, given the side effects of that sentence. It ends his career as a bus driver, as no bus company will take on a driver with a serious criminal record until it's spent (which won't be for 8½ years), nor will they assist him in getting his PCV licence. Similarly, his ban and associated conviction will have to be declared if he tries to get any driving job - and until we're short on unemployed people who can drive, employers will prefer to take on the guy with the clean licence rather than the guy with criminal convictions for driving-related offences (think about the PR if he does this again with a taxi, for example).

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"Interesting how all these housing benefit articles focus on families, and not individuals. I've looked at the data where I live - last year a single person over the age of 24, but under the age of 35 could receive £390 per month housing benefit. That same person would now receive £238.33, due to the changes that affect claimants under the age of 35.

By my maths, that's a reduction of almost 39%.

The cheapest accommodation I can find, within 5 miles of where I live, comes in at £300 PCM. That means said single person, would be expected to contribute  £61.67 out of their JSA, towards covering their rent.

Amount remaining: £208.33 / £52 per week.

**That** scenario, isn't that bad, imo. But what about people who're ""stuck"", for want of a better word, in accommodation they can't afford.

The £390 I mentioned earlier is taking the piss, when it comes to a 1 bedroom flat - most go for around £340 where I live [remember, until last April, claimants could claim £15 a week excess, on top of their rent, in some situations]. That would leave the person with £168.33 per month / £42 per week.

£42 to cover Gas / Electricity [odds are, via a pre-payment meter], Water Rates, a phone connection of some sort [mobile or landline], Groceries.

I'm Scottish and identify as such, but have no problem being called British.  I've lived in Scotland my whole life, have family on both sides of the border and keep in contact and visit the relatives in England often.

My reasons for wanting independence are pretty simple. I believe that the wealth that Scotland generates is pissed away by Westminster, that pre-devolution Scotland was poorly treated by Westminster (and continues to be, however we're in a much better position these days), that the current government in Westminster does not represent the Scottish people and thus should have no power to govern us and that we could do a much better job of running our country completely on our own.

I have nothing against England - or the rest of the UK for that matter - but frequent trips to Norway have made me wonder why they managed to build such a model society compared to us given our almost identical circumstances.  

While the blame can't rest entirely on piss poor Westminster governments, the very fact that we've had 40 odd years of offshore drilling going on up here and so much money generated that doesn't seem to have been much benefit to our country; quite unlike Norway which has wisely spent and saved.

In addition, we're fighting a war that I certainly didn't vote for (nor did any of us) and being forced to pay taxes to a government that aren't listening to us - given the opportunity to break free from that could you really blame us if we do?

I don't think this is a bad thing, it's just including it in humanities subjects. It also made me understand other people's religions more (let's face it, most people have some religious standpoint).

true,Henghast,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"Norway dosnt have similar building blocks to start with at all I'm afraid. Similar gene stock and linked histories with the UK en mass up until modern times (1900+). Norway however has never recovered from the Black Death and has a population smaller than Londons and close to that of some of the larger cities (e.g. Birmingham/Manchester).

Consider that they have this small population and then discovered vast oil and gas reserves within their international waters. Britain shares some of these fields and we've co-operated in their exploitation. However with the vast funds from their exploitation Great Britain financed a nation recovering from the tail ends of imperialism and is a major player internationally in a number of ways that Norway dosnt come close to. Add to this the fact that the UK has 10x the population crammed into a much smaller area (generally speaking the population of the UK is in pockets of England with the major cities of Scotland, Wales and Ireland making up the rest). 

The UKs increased need for money internationally and internally on top of the difficulties of working around such a large population and large constructions that were already in place makes expansion and improvement to the system more difficult. 

On top of this again the UKs social make up is different to that of Norway. The Scandinavian nations are far more liberal politcally than the UK. So more effort was made to make the citizens happy than to improve the economic situation and other more central and right wing goals which have been shown to link to a lower happiness quotia (however, how reliable such studies are I wouldnt like to suppose).

true,widgetas,null,null,"This was discussed extensively on here back when the video first came out. At the time some accused me of wanting to criminalise people who say/think things I don't like. For the record... I'm not sure I do. People can think what they like and say it, if it's presented in a reasonable way.

I think with the case of Emma West here, it's not *what* she said by the *way* she said it. She was charged with:

&gt; racially-aggravated public order offences

She stated that (more than?) one person couldn't be English because that person was black. Effectively: ""Black people aren't the same as white"" (and we could possible say she meant ""Black people aren't as 'good' as white"" but that might be pushing it).

It's worth remembering why we have such laws. It's not like these social rules have sprung from nowhere for no reason. Racism is still widespread in the UK and many black/minority people feel judged on their skin colour. It might not be as bad as it was 20 or 30 years ago, but it is still a real issue.

I can understand why people might say ""This sort of law is outrageous and limits free speech."" but I'm not convinced that that is a reasonable defence. I might be open to persuasion, I think, if anyone wants to convince me but at the moment my response is ""The only possible reason you could want to say that is to demean someone because of their heritage which has, in the past, caused many social ills and injustices. What's wrong with trying to stop that sentiment being presenting in public in an upsetting way?""

As I said before, there's a difference between:

&gt; ""I'm not sure that black people are as hard working as white. There seem to be a good many black people who do not contribute as much to society as their white counterparts.""

and

&gt; ""Fucking blacks, you ain't helping this fucking country! You don't fucking work!""

Of course, both can be heavily criticised for their racial overtones (to say the least) but only one can be described as a ""Public order offence"". The presentation is such that it could upset or scare the recipitant.

Again to make my own position clearer, I'm not a fan of ""offence"" as it's subjective and hugely open to abuse. It's often a catch all term for people who are a little too precious and think their delicate sensibilities shouldn't be harmed. But when it comes to voicing sentiment that has, as I mentioned earlier, in the past been used to subject minorities to harassment, then I'm not convinced by the ""freedom of speech"" defence.",0,1329505700,null,0,false,0,c3s9mu5,t3_ptw2h,t1_c3s9mu5,t1_c3s6vip,null,1428371921,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

true,stubble,null,London Arab,"I've had my share of psychotic motorists try to swing towards me or taligate me over the years and of course there's no way I would ever condone this kind of behaviour towards a cyclist. On the odd occasion that I've seen motorists do this sort of thing to a cyclist I've ridden very slowly along to the driver's side of the aggressive car and given them a nasty stare so they know that a) there are witnesses and b) there's a bigger nastier biker to worry about now and that c) I'd be more than prepared to block the driver from going anywhere if they don't calm the fuck down. 

I don't know where the stats come from but a 15% likelihood that someone will bolt on a red light can potentially convert into an unacceptable injury rate if those jumps conclude with prangs.

London has always been an aggressive driving environment and I've watched it actually become a lot calmer since cycling took off bigtime here. When I tried cycling across town in the mid 80s I got yelled at and beeped at by cab drivers to the point where I was really terrified. Years of riding in Yorkshire hadn't prepared me for that sort of reception.

The only things I get really angry about with cyclists is when they/you choose to ignore a red light or ride through a zebra crossing that the rest of us have stopped at, and this is often when blindsided by a bus or van so there's no way to know whether there are still folks crossing.

Yes it is a minority who do this but like anything, these will give the rest of you a bad name. I get the impression that the riders who treat the morning ride to work as a power workout tend to be the least likely to stop or slow down when they're 'in the zone'...

Actually the thing that does piss me off a lot is seeing the novice cyclists try take off at a green light without really understanding what the lower gears are for. There's either an almighty wobbling or a horrendous slow motion pickup that seems likely to conclude with either a spill or a rear ending if not handled right.

Is there a case for requiring that all cyclists show proficiency before the're allowed to ride, I imagine not, but there is a common sense argument that says please learn to ride your bike before you take it out onto streets that are not yet designed around your needs...

Also in the original incident, what he should have done and what I would have done is put my brakes on and let the bus filter into the lane in front of me as it's clearly indicating its intentions and is already past him and has crossed lanes, this guy however just keeps on going. I mean what exactly is the bus driver supposed to, go straight across that traffic island and into the oncoming traffic so the cyclist bearing down on him has a bit of room to get by?

true,Crabalicious,null,null,"&gt;The problem with that assumption is, however, that it isn't his choice to retain Sterling as Scotland's currency, and there is no guarantee that Scotland would be admitted to the EU - let alone to the Single Currency.

Pretty sure Scotland meets the economic and legal criteria for EU/Eurozone membership. Whether it would have to renegotiate is of course another matter that we simply won't know if or until it happens. There's not really precedent. 

Why couldn't Scotland use Sterling? Practical considerations aside (interest rates being the obvious example), I don't believe there's anything stopping any country using the pound. I think Kosovo uses the Euro despite not being members of either the EU (or Eurozone). I may be wrong on that though. 

&gt;Salmond has also arbitrarily decided that Scotland and the UK would maintain joint defense. Where he got the fucking idea that *he* gets to make this choice is anyone's guess.

Where did you get the idea that he wants to maintain joint defence? Certainly not saying it's not so, but from what he's said, I think he'd rather have nothing to do with UK defence (at least in terms of military adventures abroad). He certainly wants Trident out of Scotland, although that may well be negotiating position considering he knows the UK probably couldn't afford to both maintain, renew, and relocate it.

Information from the simplest collection follows:

[October 2006](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_the_Falkland_Islands) - Type 42 destroyer relieves another type 42 destroyer, which had itself relieved a type 42 destroyer.

Same source, 2010 - type 42 destroyer on duty in the falklands.

Same source, April 2010 - type 23 frigate replaces the type 42.

August 2010 - type 42 replaces type 23.

April 2011-Oct 2011 - another type 42 takes over.

Oct 2011-now - another type 23 fills the role.

Now: A type 45 destroyer is there. We're decommissioning the type 42's and replacing them with type 45's. So basically, that's what we're going to be sending down there from now on. It seems argentina would like us to maintain an inferior military if we wish to patrol our own waters without being accused of ""militarising"" an area in which they are the sole nation to have commited aggresive military action in the last century.

That's at minimum 6 type 42 destroyers there since 2006 and 2 type 23 frigates, although basically the standard in the last decade or so has been to have a type 42 there most of the time, with the occasional type 23 doing duties.

That is how some people in Scotland see the situation - some Scottish people don't want to 'divorce' the UK, but are damn offended that Westminster are trying to tell them that it is up to the UK if they can or cannot ask themselves that very question.

What you (the OP) call a 'very childish powergame' is actually democracy in action, since (like it or not) the Scottish people voted in the SNP to a massive majority in the Scottish Parliament; and now Scotland is preparing to ask itself if it wants to divorce the UK, and some people in the UK are getting offended that Scotland even dare ask itself that question.

While some were from the Seychelles most of the population had been there for generations and were arguably British subjects. Despite the questionable legality of the expulsion which has been challenged many times, the British government has tried every trick in the book to avoid allowing them to return.

true,TheEvilScotsman,scottish,Scotland,"The quality of debate is exceptionally poor in the corridors of power. There are many key issues regarding both sides of the argument, in my opinon Scotland would benefit in some ways from Independence and benefit other ways from the Status Quo. Breaking this down to a purely economic matter, let me start off with Independence:

Scotland as a nation does not necessarily benefit from the fiscal union with England fully. This is nobodys fault. I do not believe there is an evil cabal in London who are directing a financial policy to the detriment of Scotland. I do believe however that financial policies are set to benefit the most capital-rich areas, London and the South-East of England. Scotland however is rich in minerals so can still turn a profit in its own right. Our economy is also, though not exactly thriving or bustling, performing at a standard which is not poor. Arguably, this is in spite of the UK's fiscal policy rather than because of it. Salmond's idea of lowering corporation tax would provide Scotland a comparative advantage, more businesses would feel Scotland a better place to run their business from. I doubt however, quite how independent Scotland could be by keeping Sterling, only an independent currency and central bank could ensure independence for Scotland's finances. The sort of change he is proposing to attract business to Scotland could quite simply be attained by DevoMax.

Now what financial benefits do the Status Quo have for Scotland? 

I can only think of one reason, but it's a big one. Larger nations such as the UK, with a greater diversity of sectors, are undoubtedly more stable than smaller nations which, though Scotland has some diversity, largely base their fate on a resource with such a volatile price as oil. To acheive similar levels of stability in Scotland as an independent unit would require years of careful re-structuring. Norway, a nation to which oil is an important pillar of the economy, has many other significant industries that it can fall back on - in part due to the oil development fund. 

Both these economic arguments however rely on what the government immediately following independence would do. If this government made a clever choice and worked for the long-term, as did successive governments

true,JB_UK,null,null,"Scotland was fairly badly treated over North Sea oil, and even though not all of it would be in their territorial waters, there's still plenty to give the Scots a decent nest-egg. And they'll probably do an Ireland: cut corporation tax and attract multinational business. The major problem for nationalists is what the currency should be. It's really bad timing with the Euro crisis, and you have to have faith that the Euro will still be there long term. And even then you abandon some monetary levers. I reckon they'd end up with a marginally higher GDP than the rest of Britain, but with less global influence. 

And in terms of Scottish, English, Welsh and Northern Irish citizens I don't think it'd change very much, people will still cross the border, Scots will continue to marry the English, Welsh Scottish, and so on. Like the case with Ireland, where so many people cross the border that [there are an equivalent number of people with an Irish parent or grandparent in Britain as there are in Ireland](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1224611.stm). And the Westminster government will continue on much as before; rUK is 55 million of a 60 million population, in terms of economic might the difference is 5-6 years of good growth. The main issue for the rest of us is the symbolism of it all, and the loss of the Scots as a diverse voice within the UK community.

I think the best thing for everyone would be continued financial devolution to Scotland, alongside English regional and Welsh devolution, and then the maintenance of a looser British identity, with a central, federal, more limited government. As an Englishman, I quite like the idea of the regional identities- the Cornish, those from Yorkshire or the Northeast- gaining more national prominence. The cultural and governmental domination of the south-east is a problem for the whole country, not just Scotland.

true,FreddyDeus,yorkshire,Ayup,"&gt;The central bank in Scotland is, erm, the Bank of England, just like it is everywhere else in the UK.

That's my point. If Scotland became independent, they would need their own national bank (as the Bank of Scotland originally was). Salmond saying they would retain Sterling is an outrageous assumption.

&gt;Also, Bank of Scotland, and Royal Bank of Scotland, are UK banks, that pay corporation tax to the UK Treasury.

Actually, those banks were originally incorporated in Scotland, and are still technically Scottish Banks operating under Scottish Law, to the best of my knowledge. I'd look it up, but it's getting late and I've had a few pints.

But you hit upon one of the reasons as to why it would be difficult for Scotland to become politically independent but retain Sterling. The Scottish government, as far as Salmond is concerned, can continue using Sterling while his Government could do whatever it wants fiscaslly. Tax the arse out of business, tax the arse out of people, raise or lower Scottish trade tariffs, borrow until they puke, maintain a massive spending deficit, with a UK Government or the Bank of England having absolutely NO political power over those decisions whatsover.

Basically, the Scottish could do whatever they wanted fiscally, while the UK tax payer and government pick up the pieces. Can you see that happening?

Not only that, but the Scottish get the benefit of a stable reserve currency, while any wealth generated by Scotland goes to a Scottish government in the form of taxation, with the UK Government not seeing a penny. But Sterling goes through a crisis, the cost of preserving Sterling's integrity will be bourn by the UK tax payer, not the Scottish.

&gt;Scotland's GDP is higher than Ireland's

Scotland's GDP is heavily based on UK Government investment and complimentary business interests within the UK, as well as Government projects. Should Scotland become independent, much of this would dry up. Also, a fair amount of Scotland's revenue is based on North Sea oil and gas, which now has an extremely limited shelf-life. I sincerely doubt the EU would regard Scotland as a good bet to join the Euro. And you are forgetting that much of their GDP is based on trading in Sterling, which may not be the case should they gain independence.

Also, just to respond to that point, you're quite right - RBS, for example, has its registered offices in Edinburgh.

So they're unemployed because they're deliberately restricting what they look for.

&gt;  In my case I'm aiming for the forces, but the role I'm after is over subscribed and it's virtually impossible to even find seasonal part time work, let alone a part time permanent job.

I wanted to join the RAF as an electronics engineer. I ended up in the Army in REME as a vehicle mechanic because there was over a 12 month wait for the RAF. Once I was in the Army I trade transferred to electronics. Maybe doing something similar is a thing you should look at. Once you're in if it becomes obvious your skills would be suited elsewhere you'll either get offered a transfer or you can request one.

It's a fact that the original job seeker's charter was written when John Major's conservative government was in office.  It could be possible that the civil servant's who wrote it explicitly stated that certain schemes *would not work* for people over university ages. 16-19 might have been the recommended bracket.

It is probable given the workings of the civil service that massive amounts of research was done and that the government at the time accepted the findings and implemented one voluntary scheme specifically devised for that age group to take over from apprenticeships.  It would have been a way to get young people who were about to fall into the benefit system into the workforce, training and references. They probably got more benefits than they would normally do and extra expenses like travel paid, as it would have been designed for people with no household expenses and that would be fine, but most importantly it  would be a short term thing, they would generally do one course and that was it and because of this it might have been a statistical success. 

Then Blair's government could have come in to power and extended it to the next age bracket and the next and the next, the civil service being the civil service would likely have fought them on this every time and been  ignored until we got to the point we are at today with 64 year olds been made to work full time for an extra £10 a week over and over again.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;my belief that people should earn the things they want in life. 

So surely you should be against capitalism, which is all about allowing - indeed facilitating - a small minority to parasitically acquire wealth from the working majority? Socialism is about allowing workers to keep the full value of their labour.  If you're pro worker, and pro working for a living, you should be pro left.

&gt;The far left preach things like free housing and higher benefits for all. 

Not so much the latter.  That's more the preserve of the ""moderate"" reformist left and historically the liberals. To tweak capitalism to take the edge off of it, to try to use the State to redistribute wealth and stop the class divide tearing the nation apart, and to remedy some of the unfairness of the system.  As for free housing, that kind of depends what you mean.  Historically, so much of our land has been stolen from us by the parasitical capitalist class, that most people have been driven to live in a landless state at which point they end up either being forced to labour at a steep discount, forming a reserve pool of labour to keep competition for jobs high and the cost of labour artificially low or begging crumbs from the top table.  So yes, in that sense, I definitely support free housing.  But that's just demanding back what was ours so we can be independent and free.

What guarantee is there that under a fully independent government that Scotland will not have a bad prime minister/president? And lets be honest, a country of 5m will be vassal to the neighbouring powers. 

Also to consider should be the idea that Scotland can simply provide a better tax incentive for businesses once independent, Ireland is already doing that what, any business which finds the UK tax to be restrictive can already go to many low tax destination in Europe.

Well, it was written after Friday night beers, but let me see if I can unpack it for you.

&gt;Is that because they challenge your preconceptions and your privilege

Everyone raised in a capitalist 1st world country has preconceptions.  By default they are raised believing capitalist myths about how their country came to be in the position it is, how it developed, how it acquired its wealth, how it maintains its wealth relative to other parts of the world etc.  Most of these myths are demonstrably false, and some people learn this by reading critical histories, others do not  For anyone who does read critical histories, the unmasking of the myths is inevitably uncomfortable.

The vast majority of people living in developed Western nations are by definition privileged.

&gt;righties oddly refer to as entitlement when steered by the right-wing press to direct it at the most vulnerable in Britain

Right wing ideologues consistently refer to the claims of poor working people and those who cannot work for whatever reason for healthcare, education, food, shelter, etc. as being indicative of a somehow unjustified sense of ""entitlement"", it isn't, in most cases it's a surprisingly polite request for justice.  I personally feel it's time to stop politely requesting and to begin demanding justice.  The UK is the most unfair inequitable nation in Europe, and one of the most unfair on the planet, barring despotic regimes in the developing world which have usually been at least partly crafted by Western capitalists at some stage.

&gt;your comfortable existence at the expense of the vast majority of people and creatures on the planet

This isn't that hard to understand is it - relative wealth is maintained at the expense of the other.  Life on the planet as a whole can improve as we enjoy the benefits of easy access to energy and exploit the inventiveness of our fellow humans in terms of technology etc., but ultimately relative wealth is only of worth in the face of relative poverty.  Nobody is going to work for subsistence wages to make another wealthy unless they're desperate - capitalists need desperate people and when they can't find them at home they go overseas to find them.  Indeed, they'll seek desperate unprotected uneducated ununionisd people living under despotism where they can.  

More generally though, I have to be sufficiently more wealthy than those I wish to have as my servants.  There's little point having a million dollars if everyone around me does too.  No one will cut my lawn, serve my dinner, crew my yacht, provide me with sexual services, etc. if I can't leverage my wealth to make the things they need and want sufficiently expensive compared to their wealth to make those options sufficiently attractive.  If everyone is a millionaire, nobody is wealthy and it's impossible to exploit, if I'm a multi-multi-billionaire in a nation of millionaires, then millionaires are poor and exploitable (and you can pretty much guarantee food's gonna be damn expensive!)",0,1329533526,null,0,false,0,c3seb82,t3_ptq7r,t1_c3seb82,t1_c3s9lrd,null,1428375331,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It's reasonable to suggest that these trends continued in the decade from 2001 - 2011. There are also some more recent statistics which indicate that Catholics have a larger young population, with figures from Northern Ireland’s Department of Education for 2010/11 showing 120,415 Protestants and 163,693 Catholics in the North’s schools. This would be consistent with Catholics having a higher birth rate. 

Protestants are dominant primarily to the east and north of Northern Ireland, particularly in the high density greater Belfast area, whereas Catholics tend to be more spread out in large numbers in the south and west. This would be consistent with the counties outside of Antrim and Down having a slightly larger Catholic population than Protestant.

Look for this to continue for at least 50 years. Expect each referendum (yes there will be more than one) to have a very confusing question. 

Try this one on for size:

The Government of Scotland has made public its proposal to negotiate a new agreement with the rest of the United Kingdom, based on the equality of nations; this agreement would enable Scotland to acquire the exclusive power to make its laws, levy its taxes and establish relations abroad — in other words, sovereignty — and at the same time to maintain with the United Kingdom an economic association including a common currency; any change in political status resulting from these negotiations will only be implemented with popular approval through another referendum; on these terms, do you give the Government of Scotland the mandate to negotiate the proposed agreement between Scotland and the United Kingdom?


To tight? Here I'm sure this one will fit better:

Do you agree that Scotland should become sovereign after having made a formal offer to the United Kingdom for a new economic and political partnership within the scope of the bill respecting the future of Scotland and of the agreement signed on June 12, 2012?

Secondly, up until now each of the political parties in Scotland got their marching orders directly from London. They didn't define policy around what the Scottish people wanted, but what Big Brother said was good for us.

I don't think the economic factor really plays into it. Scotland could go it alone. Cameron, to his credit, even admitted it, so really it's a question of if we SHOULD, rather than could.

I've got plenty of English mates. Plenty of mates from all around the world actually, as most of us here no doubt do so it isn't the ""us"" and ""them"" attitude with me.

I'm really not sure anymore. If we were independent there's a good chance we wouldn't be dragged into anymore bullshit resource wars half way around the fucking world. That's always a plus. We'd have better representation in Europe too.

Historically Scotland has always seen itself as a European country. We definitely saw ourselves as British too but there's something that seperates us from the English culturally, that is slight, but noticeable.

But, I sometimes miss that clinical white console room. I loved the backup console room that was made of wood grain. The steampunk look of 9-10's console looks neglected, and since the Doctor is an adventurer more so than a cleaning crew, it makes it believable. The new control room looks too much like a nightclub, but I really like how the set is designed  to allow the cast to move about it, to give it space, even under the console space. It looks more believable because of those touches.

But if they made the old white console room with that much space, ahhhh now that would be cool.

I like the newer sonic screwdrivers over the classic series screwdrivers. It's probably the light that wasn't there on the old ones, but I liked Tennant's screwdriver moreso than Eccleston's or Smith's (I don't like the claw-like grabber things that can't possibly grab and all they do is flop open).

I don't mind the fairytale story telling, but I do wish the story reveals were a bit quicker, sometimes things are too slow for me.

Agreed. But how many non-Whovians are reading Doctor Who fandom? How many people reading the fandom have already sat through one or 300 episodes?

My sonic screwdriver comments didn't phase your non-opinion. If you seen some Doctor Who, you're bound to start forming opinions, especially if you watch another Doctor. 

I like the first four Doctors quite a bit, but I like Pertwee and Troughton nearly as much. In fact, Troughton and Smith have a lot in common. If Smith played a recorder he'd be very similar (Troughton might become very upset and shout at a companion, wore a bow tie, was often forgetful despite knowing so much, etc.) While Tennant really liked Davison, it took me a while to warm up to him, probably because I had just seen him in All Creatures Great And Small. and didn't see him as being credible as the Doctor (not because of his acting, mind you; I had already type-cast the actor in my mind at the time). Now, older and looking back, I can enjoy his Doctor.

So, now do you like Troughton now more than you did, or is your opinion the same? Do you see what I'm getting at?

Besides being swayed in regards to recent stories, there's also being colored on subjects of which I know little (which is why most people claim 4 is their favorite classic Doctor without having seen them all-fandom always says 4 is the best and that you should just start there and forget about 1,2,3 etc. etc.) I'm pretty well versed in classic now, so peoples' varying opinions on their favorite classic don't affect me and you can't tell me that the black and white Doctors weren't as good. Well you could, but then you might need to increase your health insurance.

You see what I'm saying? It's just the new stuff that can get to my head. If you can help me identify this phenomenon, I'd be totally grateful.

Troughton and Smith are very similar- Smith's favorite Doctor is Troughton iirc. And what you say about Tennant loving Davison is true too. There were scenes of Davison where I saw Tennant. It also took me a while to warm up to Davison, but that's because he was so human to the point of plain. I think he's a good Doctor, but his Doctor-ness only really shows in Caves of Androzani for me. That's also when Davison said he first really knew how to play the role.

Star Wars: Did Han shoot first? It's been re-edited and has a disgruntled fan base (at times). Did Darth Maul really die (I mean, even though he was hacked in two, did he die?) George Lucas says he's tired of dealing with Star Wars fanboys, so he's quitting - after releasing all the 3D films, of course.

Doctor Who, though, isn't tied to one person. It's struggled for years. If you're familiar with classic Who, then no doubt you'd recall the Master Ossificator which turned actors into ""Ken Dolls"" (the special effects were limited in cost). In fact, when financial times were tight, the Doctor was exiled on earth (to reduce the budget cost of the sets).

Is Doctor Who declining? No, but it is changing. It has for years. 

What if they reveal the Doctor's true name? Would the show be cheapened? For some, yes (no matter what name they picked, someone wouldn't be happy).

What if you learned that the Doctor stole the TARDIS from his own father, that it was more of a kid stealing dad's car? (I'm not suggesting he did, rather this is a hypothetical question). Would that lessen his stealing the TARDIS? People would argue that the first Doctor looked like an old man and wouldn't be up to such a childish prank (it also wouldn't jibe with his exile very well either -- but the Doctor does say that he ""borrowed it"" and when he first saw it, it was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen - like a teenager in awe of Dad's classic Car - and the Type 40 was a vintage TARDIS when the Doctor obtained it). It doesn't really fit the Doctor Who cannon, but with 50 years of scripts, there are going to be plot inconsistencies.

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"I don't think it, as a concept, is sustainable.

Lets imagine the Scots did become independant. Ok. They're a tiny-ass country who'll need infastructure, their own military, their own Intelligence Services, their own Emergency Services, their own sports teams, their own NHS. The obvious economy to join is the Euro, which is tanking. Or they can make their own economy and have it start off presumably at a low value since its economically unproven.

In order to even hope to sustain this then the Scots will have to, right off the bat, borrow marrively or tax its people massively, probably both. 

All this for a country with a population of 5.2 million. None of its main cities has a population over that of one million. Hell, none of them even come close.

The only way Scotland can survive as an independant nation is if England, Wales and Ireland continue to contribute to it as they have done previously through Parliament. Yet...why should we do that?

What possible advantage is there for us if we do that? Will Scotland attack us? With a population of five million? Where would they get the soldiers? Sure military bases north of the border would keep them supplied for a while, but we know every detail about every single one of them. By rights we should be stripping those bases of everything useful and painting a giant middle finger on every single front door on every base.

Oil? I'm sorry, you wanted Scotland to be independant, the north sea is British waterspace, not Scottish.

Saving money? Not really, we already seem to spend a lot on Scotland, and Scotland seems to enjoy taking the piss.

There is no advantage for England in allowing that. While there's potential for cheap trade, Scotland would first have to establish its own manufacturing independant of England in order to allow that. 

The entire plan is a Scottish guy pissing on a British fireman as he tries to put out a house fire and calling it a contribution.

If Scotland goes independant with the continued financial, military and social support of England then the rest of us might as well pack up and move somewhere else. Preferably somewhere with a fucking spine.

&gt; An ethnic group (or ethnicity) is a group of people whose members identify with each other, through a common heritage, often consisting of a common language, a common culture (often including a shared religion) and/or an ideology that stresses common ancestry or endogamy. Another definition is ""...a highly biologically self-perpetuating group sharing an interest in a homeland connected with a specific geographical area, a common language and traditions, including food preferences, and a common religious faith"". The concept of ethnicity differs from the closely related term race in that ""race"" refers to grouping based mostly upon criteria that in the past have been presumed to be biological, while ""ethnicity"" also encompasses additional cultural factors.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"Scotland already has ""infrastructure"", presuming you mean the administrative bodies necessary to run local and national government.

Military and intelligence services would obviously need to be developed (probably simply by splitting off personnel from the existing UK services). However many other European countries managed to avoid being sucked into the Afghanistan/Iraq tarpit so the need for military expenditure would be greatly reduced (e.g., the chances of an independent Scotland participating in an attack of Iran are zero - for the UK, I would say it's quite likely we will become involved).

The emergency services and NHS are already separate entities, as is the legal system.

Currency is probably the largest obstacle, as the Euro is not necessarily the obvious choice any more. Retaining the pound seems more plausible - the Bank of England is one of several banks allowed to issue banknotes within the UK, and their monetary policies are required by law to be issued independently of the government of the UK (the Treasury is only allowed to be involved in truly extraordinary circumstances). Pound sterling is currently used by several self-governing entities that are related to, but independent of, the UK (the Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey, etc) so an independent Scotland could simply use the same model.

A population of 5 million is entirely plausible within the EU. Slovenia has 2 million, is much more agrarian than Scotland, and yet exists quite happily as an independent entity within a larger grouping of countries.

I assume your ""England, Wales and Ireland continue to contribute"" refers to the idea that Scotland is subsidised by the rest of the UK. This is incorrect; the 2009-2010 Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland review shows that from a population of 8.3% of the UK we actually contribute either 8.3% of GDP (without oil) or 9.4% of GDP (with oil). You can read this at http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2011/06/21144516/6

The boundary over the North Sea was changed in 1999 (by Labour, to Englands advantage), however this legislation makes it explicit that the territorial waters defined as Scottish fall under Scots Law - the English/Northern Ireland portions are defined as those portions which do not fall under Scots Law. As such the idea that this is ""British waterspace"" is only correct in the context of entities outside of Britain (e.g., it's not Swedish). For the purposes of entities within the UK, it is quite clearly defined as Scottish/English/etc.

Your final five paragraphs do not seem to contain any points I can reply to. However the implication seems to be that Scotland can only survive by the grace of England - many of us feel differently, and think that many of the issues that have been raised so far can in fact be resolved.

I was not alive at the time of the previous independence campaigns in the 70s, however reading back it seems that the major difference this time round is that there is no longer a Scotland-vs-England feeling (at least in Scotland). Instead if it is simply that Scotland has different aspirations than the rest of the UK (e.g., a stereotype, but more left-wing/less pro-war/more pro-Europe) and as such we wish to go in a different direction than you.",0,1329568015,null,0,false,0,c3shh1n,t3_ptwau,t1_c3shh1n,t1_c3sgvv4,null,1428376822,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

First off the tiny country argument is ludicrous - you don't think Norway or Denmark could survive as independent countries? Oh wait, they're among the most prosperous in the world.

Disregarding the sports teams thing (a country *needs* sports teams?Even if that was true, we already have them...), how do you think things are in Scotland just now? Of course we have infrastructure, how could even a region of a country exist without it? We have a Parliament for god sake.

The NHS is already independent in Scotland, thank god, and emergency services aren't controlled directly from London you know...

Defence is an issue that would have to be sorted out in terms of dividing assets, but it's hardly like Scotland couldn't have armed forces: see Norway, Denmark, Sweden, etc again. Plus we wouldn't be paying for nuclear weapons or ridiculous jaunts off around the world so we'd save a fair bit on it as well...

Salmond's already said that Scotland would keep the pound for the foreseeable future, and before you come back and say ""but wait, we won't let you!"", that's not a legitimate position to take. You only have to look at the US Dollar and the non-EU users of the Euro to see that it is perfectly possible to share the use of a currency.  The bank of England is the UK central bank (founded by a Scotsman incidentally), and is independent of government. While there may be a possibility of the BoE setting unfavourable rates after independence, this is hardly likely given how close the two economies are.

In terms of not having the money to support itself - well Scotland has been in surplus the last 5 years while the UK has been in deficit. Maybe you should ask if the UK can support itself instead?  As for England paying for Scotland - well the Times and the CEBR, hardly noted for being the most pro-Scotland institutions [have something to say about that](http://wingsland.podgamer.com/the-invisible-truth/).

Finally - the North Sea (all of it? I'm sure there's a fair few countries that would have a bone to pick with that) is ""British waterspace""? Sure, while Scotland is part of the UK it is. But if Scotland were to become independent then international law has clear guidelines as to apportioning the continental shelf - it's disputed what would go to Scotland but current thought is of area containing about 80-90% of UK Oil.  Not even the most staunch unionists in government are arguing that the UK would keep all the oil.  The only way that would happen were if England were to ignore all international law and precedent and forcefully keep it - are you really suggesting that is what would happen?

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"I agree with you that 2011/12 figures are going to differ from 2003, for a variety of reasons, not least of all, the piss-poor state of public transport. That said:

You're also missing the fact that the report in question claims an average commute time, of 45 mins. If 3% of people cycle, and 10% walk, then I'd argue that ""average"" is significantly weighed in favour of people who commute via cars or public transport.

A quick Google search, seems to suggest the average person walks around 2-3 MpH. So let's assume 2.5MpH. That works out to roughly one mile, every 25 minutes. So in 45 minutes, that person would ""commute"" 1.87 miles.

A five mile walk, would take two hours, each way. That's probably in-line with the amount of hours recipients of JSA are expected to travel.

If you compare that result, to other methods of transport:

* Car: Assuming 30 Miles per hour, that's a commutable distance of 22.5 Miles, in 45 minutes. In the time it would take someone on foot to travel 5 miles, a car driver could travel 60 miles.

* Bike: Assuming 15 Miles per hour [For a novice cyclist - as they cycle more, that speed will obviously increase], that's a commutable distance of 11.25 Miles, in 45 minutes. In the time it would take someone on foot to travel 5 miles, a cyclist could travel 30 miles.

Now I'm not for one moment suggesting the DWP dish out cars to claimants, so they can get to jobs / work placements. And I **do** agree with you, that following Tebbits' suggestion to hop on a bike *is* a somewhat valid suggestion. It still incurs costs, however.

I believe the Jobcentre has ""pots"" of money, that claimants can apply to, for expenses. It might not, therefore, seem out of line to ask someone to ""borrow"" £50/£100 from said pot, to pick up a bike and the relevant safety equipment, so they can get to a work placement.

The counter-argument, to that, however, is that's all fine and dandy, if the participant get something out of said placement. And by ""get something out of"", I mean by their requirements, not the DWPs - i.e actual, useful, work experience, a job at the end of it, etc, etc.

Otherwise you're asking claimants to tap into their welfare payments, to get to / from a placement.",0,1329568418,null,0,false,0,c3shhs2,t3_prfvm,t1_c3shhs2,t1_c3sheve,null,1428376831,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

No. Wrong, wrong, wrong. 

Britain refers to the Island of Britain which contains England, Scotland, and Wales. The official name of the country, since the 1921 treaty which established the free state of Ireland, has been the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, but it is not part of Britain, technically (although the unionist population would think of themselves as being British)

* People being refereed onto programmes, need a contact number so that the external provider can get in contact with them.

* Energy (oil would be a significant revenue source in the short term, but Scotland has ideal conditions for wind and wave power)

* Health (NHS Scotland is a separate entity from the NHS in England &amp; Wales: bodies like NICE give UK-wide guidelines, but where and how money is spent is already decided in Scotland)

It's only by dint of EU law that they get it and English students don't, by virtue of a lack of cross-border element.  Sure they could give free education to English students too, and they are discriminating in not doing so.  But it wouldn't be workable to provide it.

Have you been to Sottish universities and seen how many English students there are already? If English students could receive free education in Scotland then by virtue of relative population sizes alone Scottish students would be wiped out by education migrants who would then go back to England when their degree was finished.  Not to mention that the Scottish budget would be completely wiped out paying for students who had no long-term future in Scotland.  Sure there's a similar problem in terms of EU students but it pales in comparison to what would happen if it also applied to English students.

There's no reasonable way in which English students could get free University education in Scotland (unless it was paid for by English taxes  of course, as Scottish places are paid for by Scottish) - so the only outcomes are either that English students have to pay fees in Scotland or *everyone* pays fees, which surely can't be what you want?  The Scottish government is choosing to spend a proportion of its budget on what I think is the noble aim of providing education to Scottish residents (note residents, not just Scots), and unfortunately the only way it can provide this is by setting limits.  Yes it may be unfair and is discriminating but it is necessary.

Chris Tappin will spend the next couple of years in a gang-infested US prison, waiting for trial. He was entrapped by The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement into shipping industrial batteries to a front company for this agency. He insists he had no idea they were going anywhere other than the Netherlands, or that they might be diverted to Iran for use in missiles.

He was indicted on three counts by a Grand Jury in El Paso. He was given no opportunity to defend himself. He didn't even know this was going on until he was arrested in May 2010.

On Friday 24th of February, at 9:30am, he must report to Heathrow, where he will be handed over to US Marshalls, flown to the US, and, on arrival, manacled, strip-searched and then thrown in a cage.

His trial might not start for years. He cannot receive legal aid, and he has already spent $65,000 on his American lawyer. He claims that six of his defence witnesses have refused to testify for fear of being arrested. There is no guarantee he will survive prison long enough to make trial.

Much of this has been cited from the print edition of The Times. I will try and find other online sources for this that isn't behind a paywall.

* Get to your work placement early, speak to whomever is in charge, and explain the situation. Tell them you contacted the Jobcentre, and have been told you need to sign-on, as normal.
* Get some kind of proof you've attended your work programme. The easiest would be a compliments slip from the company / a piece of paper with the header on, and have it signed by someone working there.

I do, I'm an anarchist after all and that's how we roll.

&gt;Probably because your ideals don't actually work in practice. 

Well, thus far they haven't been given a great deal of space to do so on a large scale, the State does its level best to criminalise even the idea because it finds us so scary.  However, they've done extremely well on a small scale, and didn't even appear to be going too badly in civil-war-riven Spain until a bunch of right wing fascists and Stalinsts went on an anarchist killing spree in an unholy alliance of Statists.  But then Statists have always enjoyed killing people, that's how _they_ roll, and then they have the nerve to suggest we're the dangerous extremists.

Although, given that, I still have to be very careful. Depending on how my driving habits are in any given period of time, I can take a week or two to get through a story, or I can take a couple days. For instance, I recently finished Shada in two days.

The first episode(s, I think it was a two parter) of DW I saw was Smith as the doc when the Silurians are first introduced. No River Song and I think may be the first time I see Rory ""die"". I was intrigued. I then went on Netflix and started watching it in order from the first 2005 season. I didn't get into any fandom until after I watched all through 9 and 10 and back at 11 because I really began to dislike where Moffat was going with the show when he took over. I was curious to see if anyone else had the same opinions. 

Series of 9 and 10 were more adventure, 11 turned into a WTF in every episode which made it less enjoyable to me personally even though I kept watching.  It will be curious to see where Moffat will take it now after what he's done to the Doctor's character (I don't know why I see him more as a hipster than a humanoid from another planet now?). I wish he'd put more effort into Sherlock (because WTF is ok in this series) and gave someone else DW.

I have always seen myself as being British and many of us do . When I grew up in Australia many of the Scottish saw me as being English which I found rather amusing considering my name .

The Scottish who want independence are the vocal minority . This vocal minority are great ones for creating Scottish myths that are , in fact , very far from the reality . They want to see themselves as being the repressed poor and oppressed minority .

It is very important to have the referendum and it must be a simple in \ out referendum .

Britain was only Great Britain with the four nations together .

If Scotland leaves the union it will not be a simple matter and it won't be a magic wand . The 'oppressed minority' will have to stand on their own two feet - good luck to them .

Britain has lost a lot of it's greatness . Scottish independence might just be the last loss - the English will have to stand up for themselves - stand on their own two feet as English not British .

The vendor in Texas, Mercury Global Enterprises, is the front set up by US Immigration and Customs.

As other have stated on this forum quite rightly, the government has the real blame for its draconian measures in the first place. Mandatory work placement in for profit businesses? What were they thinking?

And while I tentatively agree that maybe work placements for the unemployed (like myself) might be of benefit if done in the charity and public sectors, this option is also fraught with potential problems. 

Community service is done as a punishment for breaking the law, so is it really right to add people on benefits to that list? Maybe the concept of community service needs an overhaul, but even then it would be an awful stigma to attach to people potentially. 

Many charities, although holding charitable status and deriving their income from donations are run as profit making enterprises that do not generate enough end use funding for their charitable causes. Is it really right to support that kind of business over something like Tesco?

If you place people in the public sector are you taking a job away from someone and pushing them onto benefits? This would only really effect the lower tiers of an organisation and could help create a barrier to work rather than generate opportunities. 

I really don't think there is an easy answer, but there is a definite clamouring from some sections of society who see this issue as black and white. ""I have a job and am good, you don't and are bad"". ""I pay my taxes that fund your lifestyle."". 

Never mind if people had worked for decades, their contribution to the system is null because they don't work at the moment. 

Although I am oversimplifying I know. I don't envy any government trying to navigate this minefield, but I hate a government that tries to use it to score points by vilifying sections of society it does not think will vote for it. 

I know that is what governments do, but surely there must be a better way to deal with all this? I wish I was smart enough to have an answer, and not smart enough to realise I am not smart enough.

They don't play on the wings, but rather on the advanced sides of the midfield. The LM position is more suited to someone like Malouda or Giggs than to someone like Hazard or Robben.

Malouda is actually a decent defender/passer, but his service is horrible. Moving him into a LM position means he can focus more on linkup play and keeping the other team's RB pinched back than on providing the final ball (which, as we have all seen this season, he is terrible at).

However, I still don't think AVB is the man to build our future. He has little experience and most of his tactical decisions have been absolutely horrific. Taking off Sturridge against United and reverting to his regular (failed) formation after we went 3-0 up was stupid. He should have kept it the same and stuck the knife in. Playing a high line against Arsenal at home at a few months turned out to be disastrous. He continuously plays Mata on the wing, even though it's clear that he's much more prolific as an attacking midfielder. He stubbornly refuses to change things up and his tactical errors have caused a lot of the players/fans to lose confidence in him.

Some points I took from the game:
-Luiz and Cahill look like they can form a good partnership, losing Terry to a ban or old age maybe won't be so bad.
-Ivanovic, despite being not quite as quick or as 'offensive' as Bos, is clearly a much better choice. He is miles better defensively, is underrated going forward, and puts in more effort than most of the other players.
-Mata needs to play centrally. Once Kalou got subbed on, he moved in behind the forwards, and thats where the goal came from. He also was able to influence the game much more. Its clearly his best position.
-Drogba &gt; Torres, if not just for the psychological effect. If AVB won't start Drogba, I'd rather see him give Lukaku a run, he hasn't played poorly whenever he gets a run.",0,1329584564,null,0,false,0,c3siy2c,t3_pv8be,t1_c3siy2c,t3_pv8be,null,1428377516,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

[http://gabrielhemery.com/2011/02/28/european-countries-and-their-forest-cover/]
Furthermore, Ireland has a tiny population compared to its total land mass so its not like it would have needed to clear significant amounts of forest for industry or even agriculture. Continental nations like Austria have much denser populations compared to Ireland (*and* they also underwent the process of industrialisation) but still have almost 50% forest cover. Another point is that Ireland has one of the best climates for growing trees in all of Europe and can grow trees at a faster rate than almost any other European country.

The cleared land is largely unused or underutilized now; its either excess agricultural or marginal land not suitable for agriculture which is why both governments have sought to invest in considerable afforestation. In the Republic they've been more successful, increasing forest cover from an all-time low of under 3% after the war to over 11% today, more than tripling forest cover. In NI things have moved slower because of the conflict and so we've only got around 6% forest cover today. The fact that both governments are looking to increase forest cover so significantly is testament to the fact that the land didn't need to be cleared of forest to being with. It was simply a result of the unsustainable exploitation of the islands' resources by the settler population.

If you weren't there for the prayers but came after, you were marked as absent or late. This can, of course, count against you at a later time. The same occurs in parliament though in that case MPs have trouble finding a decent seat, if at all.

So people are being forced to sit through prayers or at the least their presence implies they support the action. But this isn't just about prayers, this is about *Christian* prayers. How many of the councils do you think would be happy with Muslim prayers or similar? [Here's an example](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-12284894). 

It's also discrimination as it implies that the local council is only there for Christians. As certain recent polls have indicated, very few people in the country are Christian or Christian *and* support the idea of religion having a place in public affairs.

By the by, to answer a claim from the upset quarter: This whole argument has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not worship is being margialised or Christianity is being sidelined. This is due to the very simple fact that a local council (or in fact government) is not a religious institution nor place of worship.

The cry of ""Discrimination!"" is being made by people who are having their long standing privilege taken away and can't understand that the are simply being brought back into equality with everyone else.

But the council chamber has nothing to do with religion! Some councillors may be Christian, but that should be irrelevant to their actions particularly in a public meeting.

You may say I'm being ridiculous, but I think it's exactly the same thing: A public servant, in a position of authority, effectively forcing a religion in a situation where it isn't needed at all, nor relevant.

This sort of behaviour (praying before a meeting) is used in circular arguments to bolster the presence of religion in the public sphere. Even though the majority of the public is irreligious or religious in effectively only a cultural sense, the establishment cite this sort of behaviour to argue that religion - I mean Christianity in the form of the CofE - is traditional and needed and everyone wants it: ""Look, democratically elected people pray before meetings!

true,stubble,null,London Arab,"I'm a bit concerned at the use of car stats to justify how a cyclist should or should not behave. And I've certainly not claimed that cars don't jump red lights. 

If a car jumps a red light and there is a camera there, then the driver will get a nice letter asking for some money and their licence so they can have their prize of three nice points awarded.

If a car jumps a red light and hits another car or person, or cyclist, then a clearly defined legal process kicks in with insurers and prosecutions (and ambulances) and all sorts of remedies to award/penalise the various parties in an accident.

Also the car driver is generally pretty well insulated against their own stupidity by seat belts, air bags, sips and a large amount of metal between them and obect of the impact.

None of this applies to a cyclist. The danger of running a red light is hundreds of times worse for a cyclist for so many reasons. Should a cyclist hit a pedestrian on one such event then where does the injury cover come from if applicable? Presumably cyclists will be reluctant to exhange personal details with someone they have injured as they will be very well aware that they would be implicating themselves and potentially laying themselves open to prosecution and / or litigation from an injured party. Better to just quit the scene and leave the injured party behind in that case then? This happened to me when a cyclist changed lanes in front of me without looking around first. His back wheel caught my front wheel and both of us took a tumble. I got no help lifting my 250kg bike off the tarmac and no offer to pay for the clear damage that had been done to my bike. Once the guy saw I was ok he just took off and left me there to pick up the pieces. I have no recourse whatever in this case and no way to trace they guy to get my repair bill paid. Asking for traffic rights without agreeing to a framework for incident resolution seems, to me anyhow, pretty unbalanced.  If a car driver had done this it would be reported as leaving the scene of an accident....

There's certainly a strong case for campaigning for some better guidelines on when a cyclist should be allowed to cross a red light, there's nothing the feels sillier than standing with your bike in front of a red light on a pedestrian crossing when the person has crossed before the light changes. The behaviour that concerns me is the way that many cyclists show no intention of stopping and will often come on the nearside of queued traffic when crossing a red light, moreso when it's a pedestrian or zebra crossing.

For example, if Steven Moffet said in an interview ""Well, you didn't see it on screen, but off screen the Doctor used Jack's transmat bracelet to jump back on the TARDIS, steal a Fez from the costume closet, and grab his screwdriver. There wasn't enough time to film that, but that's why he doesn't have his screwdriver one minute, and then does the next"", then I would consider than a canon part of the story. Just like the Time War itself is canon, but we've NEVER actually seen the Time War on screen. Over all, Doctor Who is one big amazing work of fiction, and if the people who help create this work acknowledge that something is a part of the story, then I'm happy to accept that it is.

2) The change in formation was due to Man Utd playing Valencia at right back, and effectively having to wingers, Sturridge isn't known for his defensive duties (as shown in the game when he gave away a penalty) We conceded two penalties, one of which you could argue and say it wasn't, so you can't blame him for our players being unable to tackle, and unable to track back.

3) Read above.

4) We had a game against Spurs in a few days so he subbed key players. The goal we conceded was once again, our players fault. In this case it was Cech's (again) who fumbled a rolling ball onto the path of a Wigan player.

5) Mata plays on the wing because no one else can play their. Malouda can't play on the wing as he's shit. Our other winger is Sturridge, who completely ignores his role. We need the summer to sign a winger (or let KDB come in) who's a natural winger, so Mata can play behind the front man.

6) Experiment? You don't just ignore everything and use a random formation. He uses the same formation because of the players we have. We have players, who've been in a 4-3-3 for the last 5-6 years, most of them are old now, and can't adapt.

And surely, in the powerful counterproductive sway of his noisy arguments, proof of the existence of God? Terrible to awake in that groggy matutinal state when things lodge in your addled brain and hear shrill, ugly, cruel arguments on the radio. Atheists seem to be very good at dogma. Dawkins seems not to understand that his own zealotry is itself a sort of religious quest. And he applies the ""logic"" of science, itself a fallible human construct, to a beautiful mystery. Sure, organised religion has caused appalling conflicts. But it has also caused Michelangelo, Milton and Bach. Organised atheism has produced North Korea. There is really not much more that needs to be said.

The benefits of putting him in the middle seem to out weigh the down side to playing a weaker winger. Also, I though Kalou didn't do that bad today in the wing.

I know we need a winger, but we can't get one until summer. We need to play to the team we have, not the team we want, and AVB seems to be doing the latter. He can't always get the team he wants, and even when he does, you never know when an injury will force a change in tactics.

My problem with AVB right now is not the losses, it's his refusal to try anything different. I don't want a manager who only understands one system of play, and would rather force square pegs into round holes, than try something different.

We look so much better with Mata in the middle and my point is if AVB doesn't see that he is either willfully being ignorant so he can continue to play a system that isn't working, or he is somehow not seeing what is obvious.

Nationalism:  Nationalism is regressive and backward looking.

This argument applies equally to British nationalism, which Unionists would have us believe is the non-nationalist's nationalism of choice.  If nationalism was indeed so unremittingly evil, then these people ought to be arguing for the abolition of the UK and its merger into a European superstate as a prelude to one world government.  In the real world we live in, the 'nation' rightly or wrongly is the currency unit of sovereignty.  It's only when Scotland has recovered its sovereignty that we will be able to become truly international and be able to trade on our nationhood.  

British nationalism is the nationalism of Empire, of the exploitation and colonialisation of peoples in the Americas, Australasia, Asia and Africa. It's the nationalism of sooking up to the Pentagon in order to keep the flicker of those imperial dreams alive.  British nationalism is the insular nationalism of an island with pretensions to global status.  

Scottish nationalism isn't insular.  We have borders and we know how to reach beyond them.  Scottish nationalism is the nationalism of loving your country because it's small and harmless and needs people to look after it.

Depends, for normal people, no. For the Doctor, oh yes. Moffat writes a lot into gaps, if you look at their interactions there's a comfort between them I recognise as someone who's been married more than a decade. I don't mean the innuendo, I mean how under the banter they function like a unit, if you really watch what Moffat's doing it's like ballet. But I think you have to understand how _old_ (and good) relationships work, because he's playing it like that. My wife and I don't go around dreamily looking into each others' eyes and holding hands (all the time), we finish each other's sentences and are already doing what the other is about to ask us to do. I really get that from them.

&gt;I just haven't seen the emotion from the Doctor regarding River.

You should watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXCEOr9Pz8g As I said in another post, Smith is a genius, he underplays these scenes and gets them note perfect. There's this one bit near the end where you'll really see what I'm on about.

Are you referring to his marriage to ""good queen bess""? It's quite a different matter, marrying someone you hardly know. The marriage has no emotional significance, but marrying River? Someone he already had a romantic interest with, two people who were emotionally invested in each other? That's not the same as those ""sham weddings"".

Moffats statement is hardly an admission that they're not really married. Only that the situation is complicated.

Or maybe I'm a bit confused because my parents have been married for many decades. I don't think that any couples past a few years dreamily look into the others' eyes and hold hands (don't make me barf), but I don't think it's some kind of mechanical machine. I've never seen a couple that finishes each other's sentences though.

I'm not sure it's much of a unit functioning. Due to the timey-wimey constraints the Doctor is the one performing the ballet, juggling all the Rivers, keeping them unaware. If they really did function like a unit, they'd have a better handle on the time travel by now. They've already got a nice arrangement with the diary, now they need to figure something out for when one is in a timey-wimey situation (like the Doctor was) and they need some space/time/etc.

I think that the Towers scene at the end is definitely the most emotional- but it's not between River and the Doctor. He obviously cares for her a ton (like all companions) but it was an emotional moment between himself. His actual time spent with River is flirting and timey-wimey adventures. They actually have to have *some* moments where they discuss deeper feelings.

Ignoring for a second the fact that population and geographical size add context to a country's GDP, you're overlooking the fact that Denmark in particular has a higher population than Scotland. 5.6 Million to Scotland's 5.2 I found conflicting sources for Norway, but they seem to settle around five million, two hundred thousand people short of Scotland. Oh, and to add scale, Scotland is, according to Wikipedia, some 78,000 kilometres squared. Norway is 385,000 kilometres squared, and Denmark is 2,220,000 kilometres squared. Even compared to two small countries, Scotland is miniscule.

The sports teams are mostly for the sake of show. We do have this thing called the Olympics where countries from all over the world produce their best athletes to compete for something called a gold medal. If Scotland wants to be taken seriously then its gonna have to participate too sooner or later. 

Oh Scotland has an independant NHS? Hmmm, I wonder who pays for it.

Dividing up assets for defence, you say? I take it by your language that you're Scottish too, what with your use of the term ""we"" and all. So pray tell, given that just one of these: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Challenger_II.jpg costs between 4.2 and 6.7 million pounds, and the UK has a population outside of Scotland of roughly 58 million, ten times that in Scotland...who do you think paid the greater share of the cost for the four hundred of these babies we happen to own?

If you bought a car for two thousand pounds and someone paid you £200 of that money and then tried to say they had equal claim, would you humour them?

As for Dollars...you do realise that there's a difference between different Dollars, right? I mean they use Dollars in Singapore, but they're not US Dollars. Canada uses Dollars, but they use Canadian Dollars, not US Dollars. The name is the same, the value differs. Salmond can say whatever he pleases about keeping anything he likes, but at the end of the day, you don't usually try to keep the currency of a country you're seceeding from.  As for non-EU Euro users, they include Croatia, which expects to become a member in 2013, Iceland, which hasn't actually made up its mind yet, Andorra, which like Croatia, will join the EU in 2013, and some French Overseas collectives. All of which adds roughly zero to your point.

And how very drole, a scot saying ""Well we can support ourselves, clearly"" and yet should you pick up a copy of the Telegraph Sunday morning you will find this article: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8730055/Government-spending-gap-between-England-and-Scotland-widens.html

I say, it's almost as if the economic centre of the country is...giving money to a branch of the country? Irrespective of it's comparatively miniscule population and contribution to GDP? Preposterous!

Let me try and explain it to you this way, the UK has a population of just over sixty million in total, that includes Scots, and yet according to that article it was able to spend over ten grand for every Scot current living. Now, multiply five million by ten thousand. Got the answer? Ok, now divide that sum by five million. That number you have right there? That's the amount of tax Scotland would have collect per person to stay where it is. That is regardless of their age. So every newborn, every elderly person would also have to have their share paid by someone. Now you might be reaching for the ""Rich pay higher taxes"" option but oh wait, how many big businesses are based in Scotland again? Compared to maybe London? You know, financial centre of the country? How many Rich people? Well actually this article: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1915733.stm can help with that. Of the UK's thousand richest people a grand total of...eighty are Scottish or live in Scotland. Fantastic. 

Do you really want to bet your country's economic prosperity on eighty people? because for every non-tax payer that lives, it's another ten grand shared out between them in a country of five million. 

Oh wait, your articles indicated that due to the oil and gas reserves in the north sea, Scotland receives no subsidy, huh?

Curious, that. Very Curious. That would imply that the reserves are national property, more specifically the national property of Scotland. Yet Scotland does not produce these things, these are not a Scottish product, they are a British product. They aren't even just that, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway and Denmark all have rigs out in the North Sea. To say that the oil and gas acquired from those fields eliminates Scotland's subsidy is akin to implying that paying a taxi fare entitles you to the entire taxi whenever you want it without further charge.


You do have a point regarding the continental shelf. However, the licenses for drilling are issued from Parliament. Which means there must be some degree of negotiation involved, and England would be stupid not to take advantage of that. Besides which, while Scots undoubtedly work on the British rigs out there, not all of the employees are Scottist. Hell my uncle worked on one for a while and he lives in Trimdon. Type that bad boy into google maps and see where it takes you.

And Scotland could probably survive, yes, but not after a lot of initial turmoil and confusion. Besides, you've left unanswered one simple question, precisely why should we make it as easy for you as you seem to think you deserve? When you seem to think you'll be taking so much from us and losing or returning so very little?

He can reveal what no journalist can, the precise wording of some of the abuse the Prime Minister received in the hospital that day. Alex who tweeted at the moment he heard the words from his account @Alex_Hay that a nurse said to the PM 'I am vehemently opposed to reforms they're bad for patients and bad for care'.

true,joeflux,null,null,"&gt; The fact that any justice system is imperfect shouldn't prevent us from enacting punishment upon criminals.

Well, what would be the logical outcome if this argument did indeed prevent us from ALL punishments to criminals?

We would still lock up dangerous criminals to protect society - both in terms of protecting society against those criminals and in terms of acting as a deterrent.  It would become a lot harder to justify locking up non-dangerous criminals which doesn't seem to be a bad thing.  It would encourage us to focus more on rehab - giving ex-convicts a way to become product members of society afterwards.

I just don't see the downsides here.  I think the very idea of actively trying to punish criminals is immoral, because we simply don't have anywhere near enough understanding to make a fair judgement.

Just as a random [but real example](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Whitman) - should we punish someone who climbed up a tower and shot a dozen people with a rifle?  What if you now learn that they had a brain tumour which ""conceivably could have contributed to his inability to control his emotions and actions"" ?

You may have heard of another Brit show, Sherlock. Now, on that show, currently under the control of MOFFATTTTTTTT, there is a major character, Irene, who is (?) a lesbian. Here is something I found on tumblr (don't judge me) concerning that issue: 

""Shit that is not sexist re: Irene’s portrayal in Sherlock:

She is a sexual person

She is a sex worker

She is gay/a lesbian

She is not 100% perfect 100% of the time

She does not do literally every single thing on her own



Shit that is just generally not automatically sexist:

A woman losing

A woman needing to be helped/saved

A woman being emotional, vulnerable, etc.


Shit that is problematic, if not downright sexist, re: Irene’s portrayal in Sherlock:

The fact that she is sexualised in a way that specifically appeals to straight male fantasies when lesbians have a long history of being exploited thus in the media

The fact that this is used to reinforce the harmful stereotype that lesbians ‘just need the right man’

The fact that the way she was shown as being flawed was specifically set up to make her lose to a man in a way that reflects common stereotypes about women, i.e. they are more emotionally vulnerable than men, basically reinforcing the idea that traditional femininity = weak

The fact that Moffat and co. went out of their way to add Irene being saved into a narrative where, originally, she needed no help, in a media which tends to need women to be saved disproportionately to men

The fact that, again, they went out of their way to change it from a woman winning to a woman losing in a society where dudes typically end up the best off at the end of stories

Context, people. It’s all about context. If SCAN were a different story, then perhaps it wouldn’t have been the problem it is. But SCAN is a story about one thing, and ASiB a story about another, and the discrepancy between what Moffat read and what he wrote is the real issue tbqh."" 

I did not write this, the identity of whoever did remains unknown to me, but it's just a sample of how introducing certain characters can go terribly, terribly wrong. 

I'd like to add that I have nothing against an LGBT character, or any character, but the repercussions of certain decisions to incorporate said character can be awful, as shown by what is happening in the Sherlock fandom, unfortunately.

The entire first paragraph you seem to be havering, in what way is Salmond exclusionist? Switzerland has a population of 7.8 million but is only 41 km squared, Belgium has a population of 10 million but an even smaller land area of 30km squared and in a moment of brillance you included Greenland with Denmarks area total when in actual fact the country of Denmark is 43km squared. I do not see your point.

Scotland represents itself at the commonwealth games, and Glasgow won the honor to host the 2014 Commonwealth games which I might add is being paid in full by the Scottish government and Glasgow city council in an 80/20 split. Unlike London 2012 and Manchester 2002 (English commonwealth games), Glasgow, a Scottish city is not receiving UK taxpayers money. Scotland has some great sporting complexes already and I am sure will do fine when the time comes.

Yes, the NHS is thankfully independent from the rest of the UK. Scotland pays in its budget, costs are already £11billion. I will quote my other post because no doubt you will have no idea where this money comes from. All of Scotlands Taxes, from income tax to oil revenue goes directly into Westminster's coffers. Scotland then gets a block grant that is decided by the Westminster Government and the Scottish Government decides how best to spend that money. 

We would be entitled to our share of any and all assets because we are a successor state to the UK. Unless you are going to have a massive sulk and demand that we take nothing from your green and pleasant land in which case Scotland is considered an entirely new state and In that circumstance, international law is very clear that Scotland would not be bound by any of the obligations of the UK.  Amongst other things, that means that Scotland would not be required to take on a single penny of UK national debt. Scotland's notional share of Westminster's Department of Offence spending amounts to around £3.5 billion annually.  Less than £2 billion of that is actually spent in Scotland.  Even if we were to maintain defence spending exactly as it is now, we'd still have an extra £1.5 billion to play with.  The savings we'd make by no longer coughing up for Westminster's pretensions to Great Power status would alone pay for investment in Scottish jobs and industry which would more than compensate for any loss of defence sector jobs. The Challenger Tank Anecdote is funny considering the British Army is effectively mothballing them by sending them to Germany so they can sell land. [Link](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/feb/16/british-tanks-sent-germany-storage). Then there is the trident issue, which a report has already stated that there are no current UK alternative base www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jan/29/trident-nuclear-deterrent-scotland-independence, perhaps your beloved UK doesn't hold all the power after all.

No country can be forced into the euro.  The Czech Republic joined the EU in 2004, after the euro had been adopted as the common currency of the original 11 members of the Eurozone.  In January 2012, Czech Prime Minister Petr Nečas stated that the country did not require a special opt-out in order to retain the koruna as its currency.  Mr Nečas said: ""No one can force us into joining the euro ... We have a de facto opt-out.""  Candidates for euro membership must sign up to ERM II for at least two years before adopting the euro as currency, however it is entirely up to the discretion of each individual member state when to sign up to ERM II and member countries can legitimately delay this indefinitely.  This approach has also been adopted by the government of Sweden which has likewise declined to join the Eurozone but has no negotiated opt-out. Infact Ireland used the pound sterling as its currency from independence in 1922 until the Republic signed up to the ERM, the precursor to the euro.

Nice posting a link with no sources from 2011. I will be sure to pick that paper up this morning first I will just travel back in time and....[An Article](http://wingsland.podgamer.com/the-invisible-truth/) posted in the Sunday Times last week which is sourced from the Centre for Economics and Business Research should hopefully silence your oh so tiresome Scottish are subsidy junkie myths, well I can always dream.

Having a London centric is not a good thing, hell the banking crisis should have been enough of a wakeup call if anything a degree of spatial rebalancing to shift back wealth and power to other major UK cities should be on the cards. Not even going to start on your strawman equation or the link from 2002.

It is not about who produces the oil, it is about where the corporation tax is paid. At the moment it all goes down to London but the SNP want it to stay in Scotland. Do you think only Norwegian companies drill in the Norwegian North Sea? Have you ever heard of the McCrone Report? It is a delightful little document written by Professor Gavin McCrone, a leading government economist, for the Conservative UK government that was hidden from the Scottish people for over 30 years, I recommend you give it a read it has some wonderful little quotes such as;

&gt;“What is quite clear is that the balance of payments from North Sea Oil would easily …. transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus”.

&gt;“Dispute on these matters might well occasion much bitterness between the two countries, but it is hard to see any conclusion other than to allow Scotland to have that part of the continental Shelf which would have been hers if she had been independent all along.” 

&gt;“lt must be concluded therefore that large revenues and balance of payments gains would indeed accrue to a Scottish Government in the event of independence provided that steps are taken either by carried interest or taxation to secure the government ‘take’. 

&gt;“Undoubtedly this would banish any anxieties the government might have had about its budgetary position or its balance of payments. The country would tend to be in chronic surplus to quite an embarrassing degree and its currency would become the hardest in Europe with the exception of perhaps the Norwegian kroner”. 

&gt;“Just as deposed monarchs and African leaders have in the past used the Swiss franc as a haven of security, so now would the Scottish pound be seen as a good hedge against inflation and devaluation and the Scottish banks could expect to find themselves inundated with a speculative inflow of foreign funds”. 

Anyway I am not going to waste anymore time on this, you make alot of convoluted and ill informed arguments my tip to you would be to stop reading the Daily Mail. There are many decent and nice English people. but as a nation you have the psychology of the bully. You didn't give a damn when Scotland was having the shit kicked out of it under Thatcher. Many of you even laughed and revelled at what went on. And then the worm turns, gets organised, petitions for divorce not before holding the balance sheet in front of your face showing you how much we are worth and all you can do is act indignantly and threaten like the spiteful bully you are.

But that's another reason we allow the system to deal with people impartially.

Is execution less humane than life in prison? No, I don't think so. It has the potential to be of course, but as we've grown more civilised (matter of opinion, but I think we have) and done away with the likes of execution, we've also produced more civilised prisons. Some might laugh at me when I say that and cite any number of evils but others will argue in an entirely different direction.

With regards to your example though, I'm going to be annoying! ""Most solid proof"" - You sure? Video surveillance: Falsifiable, now more than ever. Witnesses: [Often mistaken and very unreliable](http://www.simplypsychology.org/eyewitness-testimony.html). Confession: [Also unreliable](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1134094) - interestingly there are numerous cases that demonstrate this which have come about due to DNA evidence. DNA: Granted apparently reliable, but can still be planted or left over from a previous interaction, or falsified.

I'm not trying to be contrary and I realise the example you were giving me, but really... it's not so 'clear cut' as the above usually and there are so many examples of miscarriages of justice that render execution unthinkable, even without considering the morality aspect.

I realise the art of self delusion is strong in the establishment, but for anyone to declare ""Victory!"" for religion in terms of the 'battle' with secularism/atheism (these people do not know the difference or if they do then they refuse to acknowledge it publicly) this week is somewhat ridiculous. 

In fact on the secularism/atheism thing - the first paragraph has left me utterly confused.

And now I've read the entire thing I am both angry and a little stupider than when I started. Cheers for linking to the telegraph...

&gt;  To be so dismissive of, or incurious about, such beliefs...is a very odd kind of obtuseness in people who clearly see themselves as possessing superior intelligence

So anyone who doesn't believe as she does 'just hasn't thought about it enough'?

&gt; Indeed, the anger expressed last week – which cut across ethnic and sectarian lines – against the smug anti-religion brigade was quite startling.

Startling? Perhaps. Surprising? Feck no! Be loud and angry in attempt to distract from the fact that your opinions and position are on the ropes.

&gt; The routing of the Dawkins army had been so unexpectedly successful

... Does she live in a different reality to the rest of  us? Where was this routing? *read on* Oh, she's quoting Carey. Well, nuff said about Lord Advertise-My-Book.

&gt; Interestingly, it is a question that is asked more by the believer – or the would-be believer – than by the facile atheist who prefers to talk of religious questions as if they could be settled in the laboratory.

That's possibly because most atheists who spend time talking and thinking about these issues - I don't include those atheists who were never indoctrinated as children and so don't need to consider a god they've never believed in or taught to believe in - have realised that the god proposed by Christianity is inconsistent and a logical fallacy and the conclusion ""You have to have faith"" is an empty plea. Sorry, I went all Dawkins and ""sciencey"" and ""uncaring"" and ""illiberal"" for a second there.

&gt; Why is sympathy, and revulsion at the pain of others, such a characteristic feature of our condition that it is actually called “humanity” and its lapses regarded as “inhuman”? Presumably, the Dawkins lobby would say it arose from the need to preserve our collective genes. What an impoverished view of life and its moral complexity, that is.

Study *any* social animal and you'll see similar traits, you ignorant berk. Empathy and compassion are not limited to humans. And just because you get upset by being connected to the animal kingdom and are scared that without SonnyJesus there's no point to your life *doesn't* mean that those of us who have never had a god or religion and don't have the need for one are somehow morally empty and base in our actions and feelings. Nor does it mean that we're going to sit happily and quietly while religious groups continue to hold sway over our lives for no good reason, while they claim to be the arbiter of all morals and possess of the 'ultimate truth', all the while effectively lying to and scaring children and restricting freedoms based on outdated texts and pointless rules.

Do you think she'll read this?

/rant

TL;DR for Daley's piece: ""Aren't atheist/secularists smug? I don't like Dawkins, neither should you - He thinks questions should have reasonable answers! There's more to life than evidence, Dicky, and anyone who knows anything about religion understands that you don't need to prove your god exists lol! Doesn't science give a bleak view of the world? I don't know much about it but I like Jesus because he has nice songs.""

To counter this utter drivel, here's a couple of things that the 'angry secular atheists' were 'successful' in, over the last week or so:

* NSS &amp; Clive Bone got a High Court ruling that Bideford Town Council (and by extension all others) were acting unlawfully in holding prayers as part of official business.
* The Bulls lost their appeal over whether or not they discriminated against a civil-partnered gay couple staying at their hotel.
* An Ipsos MORI poll showed that the majority of people who self identify as Christian in the UK are 1) not terribly religious in the true sense of the word and 2) think religion should be a private matter and as such 3) should not influence government. i.e. Most don't go to church or read the bible, and most agree with secularism's main aims.

Daley is claiming Dawkins not getting the title of ""On the Origin of Species etc."" right, and Trevor Philips being quoted out of context and criticised by Lord Carey, as being ""victory"" in a 'war' that the establishment are shitting themselves over because they know comparatively very few people in the UK give a toss about religion any more. Death throes of a once strong beast. Amusing, but still infuriating at times.

Unless there were *absolutely no posted speed limits* you are in the wrong. It's you responsibility to be aware of the road conditions.

&gt;In short I think I could be in the shit here as I already have 6 points on my license.

Yep, 30mph+ over the limit is usually an automatic ban.  Expect at least  a 3 month one, possibly longer depending on the Magistrate, the time of day of the offence and what your other points are for.

&gt;I've been summoned to court, and there is no plea form.

I think that's normal for a speeding offence.

&gt;Can they really expect me to go to court without seeing the evidence before hand?
&gt;Can I legitimately ask to see this evidence before I go to court?

NAL, but if it was a camera you used to be able to request a copy of the photo, not sure if you still can.

&gt;Can I challenge the accuracy of these cameras? Surely there must be some margin for error in them.

IIRC the cameras are re-calibrated regularly, you might be able to ask for the calibration date but I'm not sure how much good it's going to do you.

&gt;Can I use the fact that this was a motorway therefore the speed I was doing wasn't as excessive as it looks on paper.

Nope.  Even if it was a 70mph limit you were still 20mph over it.

I've been to court on a speeding offense, (130mph in a 70mph limit). I had a clean license, it was 5am on a sunny Sunday morning with *nothing* else on the road (apart from the Police car.....) and I got a six month ban, £500 fine and a nice SP30 on my license.

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"Calm down dear.

I read your arguments and noticed one a few consistent themes, so rather than go through point by point I'll just answer generally.

First theme is fairness and you're right. Scotland is entitled to its fair share of resources and assets in the event of secession whether it does so with Westminster's consent or not. However, that's entirely my point. Scotland's fair share is probably less than it has been receiving of late. The article you posted has been posted before, and I'll say to it what I said to it previously, it implies that the gathering, refining and selling of those gas and oil reserves are entirely down to Scottish influence, when drilling licenses and the like are dished out from Westminster. So your hold on them will frankly be disputed, and lets be frank here, there's no way Westminster is really going to let you all just walk away with that oil if they can help it.

All that aside, if you want your fair share then fair enough. However it would mean looking more closely at your source too, one of the comments links this article: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-14720538

However, has it ever occurred to you that since Scotland's population is just over five million whereas the rest of the UK has a combined population of maybe fifty six to fifty eight million that, by simple math, you're entitled to 10%? After all, a country with 10% of the population should only need 10% of the assets, right? 

Secondly, economically. You're right, nobody can be forced into the Euro, and yet once it has you, the EU seems rather reluctant to let you go as Greece is finding out. Though to be honest I haven't read any reliable news sources regarding Europe in a couple of weeks so for all I know the entire place could have been an en-mass satanist cult by now. However, I'm going to make three guesses as to the current state of the Euro.

First, despite probably at least one summit, there is still no definitive rescue plan for the nations of the Euro that are most at risk or, if there is, it involves chucking money at them.

Secondly, despite their ongoing and seemingly endless economic woes, Greece is still using the Euro as it's currency.

Thirdly, nobody of any importance inside the EU has made any indication that my first or second guess are about to change.

While I don't particularly want to debate Europe as well as Scotland, I also don't see how you got the idea of being ""forced"" into the Euro. 


 You make the point that the UK shouldn't be so centered on London, to which I have to ask...why? Ignoring for a second that it's the nation's capital, it's also where a vast majority of business headquarters and head offices can be found, not to mention the sheer quantity of people living there. 

Ignoring for a second that other urban centres exist along with the fact that businesses can base themselves whereever they damn well please, isn't that point a bit pointless? Businesses go there because everyone goes there, but even those that don't go there go to places like Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds.

The UK doesn't focus on London as much as you seem to think, but to be honest given that it is the capital city of our nation and the place where a majority of operating businesses and banks reside, not to mention where Parliament gathers, where the Royal Family have their most famous residence and where a fair chunk of our tourist trade comes, frankly it makes sense to focus on it.

Next up, oil. Of course the SNP want it to stay in Scotland, but you see, naturally occuring resources like oil and gas are a national asset, not a personal one. Any fool knows how valuable oil is these days, after all.

The question, though, is whether or not Westminster will really just up and allow Scotland to take decidedly more than its fair share. I admit I haven't heard of the Mccrone report, no. Well, not until now. Took a look, authored in 1974 so...yeah you can stop pointing out how old my sources are. More to the point, however, I admit this is a thorn in my side, until you consider that, as you pointed out, its not where the oil is but where the corporation tax goes. On that subject, it would be England's right to tax appropriately any and all businesses operating in England. So the question is; where are these oil companies based? The largest of them is BP which seems to operate from...London!

&gt;my tip to you would be to stop reading the Daily Mail. 

Well aren't you adorable? My tip to you would be to stop sucking Salmond's dick.

&gt;here are many decent and nice English people. but as a nation you have the psychology of the bully. You didn't give a damn when Scotland was having the shit kicked out of it under Thatcher.

I'm sure it was JUST Scotland, wasn't it? mmmm, not all coal producing (among other things) towns, no no no, JUST Scotland. Yes.

You know, its funny that you say we have the psychology of a bully, because it implies that we wouldn't allow for, say, Scottish ministers. Also, the term ""bully"" tends to imply the use of force when unless I'm horrendously misinformed, none has. I do wonder what qualifies the use of such a term when being threatened by an MP is probably equivalent to being threatened by a tree given how much actually comes from those threats.

&gt;Many of you even laughed and revelled at what went on.

Careful, use of stereotypes could really hurt your credibility right about now. You know Thatcher didn't just bash the miners, she also privatised quite a lot too, something that cost a lot of jobs and cost a lot of people a lot of money south of the border. Don't presume to be suffering too much.

&gt;And then the worm turns, gets organised, petitions for divorce not before holding the balance sheet in front of your face showing you how much we are worth and all you can do is act indignantly and threaten like the spiteful bully you are.

I don't recall threatening anyone, if there's anyone here who's angry or indignant then I reckon it's probably you. However, since I'm sure you know best, I'll bite. Ignoring for a second the fact that Thatcher came out of power some twenty odd years ago, I assume either this isn't being done in direct reaction to that, or Scotland must still be using travelling merchants to spread news. 

Secondly, this would imply that everything that Thatcher did would be undone by the SNP. Good luck with that.

Lastly, it wopuld imply beyond everything else that everything Thatcher did was purely to scorn Scotland and that she never harmed British industries or British people which, again, is an outright lie. It might interest you to know that the first strikes of the Miner's strike in the eighties was in Yorkshire. Not a Scottish town or mine, an English one.

However, you seem like just another angry Scot. So rather than presume that you'll listen to anything I've said, I'm going to imagine you wearing blue face paint and screaming incoherently at everyone who you deem un-Scottish.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yes, I have watched Sandro pass the ball, considering I've watched every single Spurs game over the past two seasons... I certainly do not consider Sandro ""less positive"" than Parker and ""less accurate when attempting to be incisive"". I feel far more comfortable with Sandro, rather than Parker, in possession in the opponent's half of the field because, as stated, I feel he moves the ball far quicker (as I said, I believe Parker takes too many touches and then just recycles possession with the CBs, whereas Sandro - like the top ball-winning DMs: Mascherano, Senna and Essien a few years ago, Cambiasso, Yaya Touré when he used to play deep rather than as a #10 - can play a higher tempo game). Just one example of this, for me, was Sandro's contribution in our win against Arsenal this season. Anyway, I believe Sandro is well on his way to becoming one of these absolute top-tier defensive midfielders and one of the best midfielders in the world. Let's hope the fitness issues he's had this season don't hinder that.

As for statistics, I don't pay a great deal of attention to them. Based upon them, QPR's Alejandro Faurlin is the most effective-ball winner in the Premiership, but I don't see fans of other clubs clamouring to sign him up. Last season Lucas Leiva was the top tackler in the league, a player who I've seen be frequently derided by Tottenham supporters. In my opinion, the very best sides do not rely on players as limited as Parker is, but they would love to have a player like Sandro in their side.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans along. We've had approximately 780 episodes but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in anywhere.

The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a person will like.

Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 then relaunched in 2005. By no means do I suggest you start at 1963. You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

And even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor. The ninth only has one series with some questionable writing, but he's a fantastic Doctor as well, and shines when given the chance. No matter what you do, watch all six series.

- River used eleven regenerations to keep the Doctor alive. Eleven is the number it took, and that energy is used up. If less energy was needed, I am fairly certain it would have left River with a regeneration or two. She saved his life, but didn't give him extra regenerations.

This conflicts with what I'm about to say:

- The twelve regenerations limit is a limit set by society. The Gallifreyan society. The argument here is that a Time Lord can regenerate an infinite amount of times, but is limited by law. Since Gallifrey fell, the last of the Gallifreyans have been sent back along with the Master, The Doctor is the last one. He can do whatever the fuck he wants. If he decides he's going to regenerate two thousand times, so be it. The makers will probably use this explanation to keep the show running as long as possible while not limiting themselves to only two more actors.

Arguing against my own counterargument:

- River isn't a proper Time Lord. She's a human baby with a string of Time Lord DNA. It is fairly possible that this limits her amount of regenerations.

As Doc from Back To The Future explains [here](http://thepoorprincessdiaries.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/timeline.jpg), when you change an event in time, its past and future are changed with it. You cannot go back to the alternate timeline without changing that fact back. If you travel back to a certain point in time, change something and then travel forward to the time you started from, chances are that your little change has made so many follow-up changes that the now you arrive in isn't the now you left from. To fix that, you would have to go back to the point in history where you made the altering change, fix it, and then travel back to the future, because that point in the past is the momentum where the alternate timeline came into existence, wiping the other, first one out.

Of course, Back To The Future considers time to be a strict progression of cause to effect, but *actually*, in the Whoniverse, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint - it's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff. 

That being said, the Doctor we are following when watching the series is stuck inside his own timeline. That means, after 8 regenerations, we were watching Eccleston/Ninth Doctor, he regenerated into David Tennant/Tenth Doctor and he regenerated into Matt Smith/Eleventh Doctor. They are the same person with a different ""outfit"". There is some sort of ""alternate reality"" to the Tenth Doctor, where he is human and together with Rose, but he is not The Doctor. He's a clone. 

Regardless of Moffat wanting to do his own thing, he still has to remain true to the series and what has happened before.

&gt;  Rent a house for 25 years, have nothing at the end.
&gt; Buy a house and pay a mortgage for 25 years, no more rent/mortgage to live in a home thereafter.
&gt; Even if the house is worthless when the mortgage is paid off, you will be financially richer as you wont be paying rent either.


You end up buying a house you can afford and because you only have a 5% deposit you get stung on the interest. For example, a £95,000 mortgage on a £100,000 house in my town gets you a 2 bed mid terrace ex-council house with small gardens. For the same amount in rent, my parents rent a detached 3 bedroom house, double the value of the one I mentioned with mahoosive gardens. 

If you lose your job, you risk losing your home whereas if you're renting and lose your job the council pay benefits to pay or go towards the rent. Once your fixed period ends, the mortgage can go up monthly whereas renting it can only increase at the end of the tenancy period. Unlike a mortgage, it is still possible to challenge the rent.

If the boiler breaks, you pick up the bill whereas in renting, the landlord does. Three years ago our house needed re-roofing at a cost of £15000 - thankfully done before we bought it. Next door who rent got theirs re-roofed at no cost to them at all.  How many years saving over renting do you think that would have wiped out for us had we had to pay for the roofing? Going on the rental value of properties in our street, about 10-12. This year it was replacing a sliding double glazed door and a boiler repair - another £1000. In a few years time the metal guttering will need doing and we'll get the fascias and soffets done at the same time - another £1000.

If you want to move you can't until you sell your house. Our neighbours has been for sale for 3 years. And its a nice house which is cheap. The renter merely finds somewhere new to rent and hands in notice to their landlord.

When you retire you become mortgage free. When the renter retires, the council pay the rent. So both end up living in a home for no cost, except that when something breaks in your house you have to pay to fix it unlike the renter.

If you go into care, because you own a house the council force its sale to pay for your care. Whilst you're sat in the care home you look over to see the person who rented all their life who has their care provided for free. 

Home ownership is not the panacea you think it is.

That said, I decided to research a little on this. Again, this is slightly anecdotal in some instances. There's some information [here](http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Argument:Capital_punishment_has_a_deterrent_effect_on_criminal_activities) towards the bottom of the page (penultimate quote) that highlights an attempt at looking at parts you are talking about.

Now I know correlation isn't causation, it's anecdotal, but that basically says the murder rate has substantially increased in the US from 1965 onwards (not in detail so someone might make this more accurate). The specific case of Harris County in Texas could be an example of the reduction in murder rates. An increase in executed convicts has occurred there, with a fall in murder rates over the same period. I would assume there would be social/economic factors involved (when isn't there), but there is some correlation in the numbers it shows. 

Unfortunately, the only real test of pre-prior murder rates in states in the US is the suspension of execution between 1972-1976, but this anomaly cannot be accounted for as legal challenges made the time being looked at difficult to analyse.

One article [here](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/FaganTestimony.pdf) shows that there is no real correlation at all and that the deterrence factor isn't there, along with counter proof from New York State showing deterrence doesn't occur from death penalties.

David Haye is a media whore and to be fair he freely admits that he is, his own words are "" Well as a boxer I don't have that many fights in me so I need to make as much money as possible"" I'm paraphrasing obviously, but I can some what understand that. 

Of course you can hate his methods all you like I personally think he is acting like a juvenile thug but the result is more money for him and that is what he is interested in, so his results show for them self.

I have made no payments to reduce the loan principal and I pay £54.49 in insurance every quarter.

I had to replace the gas central heating once (£1000, or about £7 pcm if spread out over the time I've lived here). When I moved in I purchased energy efficient fridge/freezer and washing machine for a couple of hundred pounds each, they both still work well (call it another £4 pcm). There has been two major ceiling repairs due to water damage, each cost me £50 excess (total £100 or 70 pence pcm for the time I've lived here). There have been no other major maintenance costs.

Since about two years back I have enough money (in an ISA and in directly held shares) to pay off the mortgage in full. The dividend payments that I receive exceed my mortgage interest payments.

Bottom line, I'm currently better off by more than £400 pcm by having purchased rather than rented. Over the twelve years, the average is probably closer to £250 pcm saving or about £36,000 total.

true,adapa,scottish,Aberdeen,"Hey,

I realise this was posted 2 months ago, but thought I'd give some views.

I am currently a third year student studying Computing Science.

The studies are pretty damn good. We currently have some lecturers rewriting courses at the moment so they are as relevant as they've ever been. Java is the ""main"" language you'll learn, but I've also dabbled in Python, C, PHP, and there's even a course on Haskell!

Accommodation is pretty cheap considering it's the oil capital of Europe. I pay £320pcm for a room that could easily fit two people + en suite. Unfortunately, being a computing science student, I am single thus have it all to myself. (Pros and cons).

I got a job at the University, which was pretty easy, just over the summer originally but now I'm consulting for them on and off. Fun + learning cool stuff. In retail and less academic jobs, there's plenty to go around from a couple of hours a week flyering for a club to a full part-time job in a retail store.

I dislike the length of the day. Being so far North, it can get dark quite early on.

Haven't graduated yet, so I can't answer your last question.

If you were wanting to know so you could apply for a masters course that started in January, I'm too late, but if you're starting in September, I hope I've helped. Some links:

If your neighbour hasn't sold their house in 3 years, it's too expensive.  No argument.

There's no guarantee that councils will, in future, always pay market rates for rent.  Your council may end up telling you to get somewhere cheaper, so the house that's been your home all those years might no longer be open to you.

If there's not enough money to house people in London, and if there's not enough houses in London either, then housing people who are homeless in London elsewhere where there is more availability and also there are cheaper houses (meaning more homeless people can end up with housing) is a pretty common sense solution.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;  Rent doesn't have to be high in London, greedy landlords need to have their demand for £2000 a month rents capped instead of capping people's benefits.

Oh the irony of that sentence. In the first three words you say London is expensive and then you say Landlords are greedy charging £2000 a month rent. Are they greedy if they charge £2000 a month rent but the cost of the mortgage and costs for renting out that property is £1800? A repayment mortgage on a £325,000 property is nearly £1750 a month and the Landlord also needs to have insurance, pay for gas safety checks, repairs that need doing plus any redecorating and replacing/repairing damage when the tenant leaves.

&gt;  Then the benefits wouldn't need to be so high in the first place, and the taxpayer won't be forced to pay to relocate all of these people who can't afford their homes any more.

Does the mortgage repayments on the property suddenly drop just because the rent cap lowers? And what happens when the rents don't service the mortgage and associated costs anymore? Landlord evicts tenants with a Section 21 notice and sells up. Tenants can't afford to buy it, thats why they're renting in the first place.

&gt;  but also stops a handful of wealthy landlords getting richer, and we can't have that.
