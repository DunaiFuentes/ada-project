The only place I ever felt unsafe enough to have a gun strapped to me was in a war zone.  A Starbucks in suburban Phoenix?  Please.  I am more worried about a dumbass who doesn't make sure the safety is on than a crackhead with a sawed off shotgun robbing the place.

This is slightly different in that there are no major twists in this scene. Obviously the Doctor's death includes quite a few twists.

Isn't that enough?

Even if there were a TARDIS technical manual then you still wouldn't know what's happening.  You'd just get a bunch of made up names for things when you look into them that make no sense.

What we know is:

The bit in the middle that goes up and down is probably called the time rotor.  The Doctor used to have a cat that liked to sleep on it.  There's a scanner that can be used to look outside, which was originally black and white.  The TARDIS doors are operated from the console.  There's a coat-stand by the door. There's a fast return switch which can be used to go back to the last place.  It's old, a type 40, obsolete when the Doctor nicked it.  It has a chameleon circuit, which hasn't worked since it left a junkyard in 1963.  He tried to fix it once but it broke down again, and he decided he liked it better that way.  One of the reasons the Doctor is so rubbish at piloting it is that it's a 6-person craft, hence the hexagonal console.  But he's getting better with time, much better.  It makes that wheezing noise because the Doctor leaves the brakes on.  There is a test to drive TARDISes.  He failed.  It can go invisible.  Yo-yos do not form an essential part of the operations of it.   There's a wardrobe, a swimming pool, and a zero room.  You probably shouldn't materialise it within itself, that would be confusing.  The interior is in a state of temporal grace, meaning no weapons can be fired inside, but that hasn't worked in years.  It can materialise *around* things.  The telephone on the outside isn't a real telephone, except when it is.  It's alive, and grown from a piece of coral.  The lock is an incredible advanced piece of alien technology that if you try and tamper with it will kill you, but can be easily removed by Sensorites and is on close examination just a Yale lock.  It was named by Susan.  The Doctor didn't know it was alive until Barbara pointed it out. It keeps copies of old control rooms, and control rooms yet to be used. There are bedrooms.  The Doctor keeps everyone's old rooms when they left on a ring, all the way up to Lucie Miller...",0,1341957699,null,0,false,0,c5c6a6h,t3_wckvi,t1_c5c6a6h,t1_c5c63u9,null,1429344488,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

true,vertigo42,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"Glocks are pretty standard. There is no need for a safety in a weapon that should never be drawn. The weapon is perfectly fine within its holster, and it should never be touched or drawn. You don't hear of ND's with glocks or SW M&amp;P or every other concealed carry fire arm is because people who carry know you shouldn't be fucking touching it when its not needed. It won't go off in your holster. Unless you are playing with it by sticking your hands down the side of your pants.
 
Machine guns need safeties because they are in someones hands at all time. Concealed firearms should be as if they are not there. You ignore them because they are concealed. Your hand is not on the grip of the firearm at all time like it would be if you were on patrol with your m4, or saw, or sitting in the gunner seat on a humvee.

1. No If you need to draw, you are firing. You never draw to threaten, only to act. So if its drawn it means you have made the decision to fire it. Removing that extra step saves lives.

2. No. Any where someone can be insane enough to decide to end someone. If you are not armed and you are in the location this goes down, well then you did not protect your life. Cops are there to enforce punishment, not to stop a crime from happening.

3. No Many law abiding citizens carry and have saved their own lives and many others due to their quick thinking and training in the use of a concealed firearm. There are criminals and the fact that people who want to break the law won't care about gun laws means that gun ownership is part of the right to self defense.

4. No. Once more I say again. At any time some jackass could decide to end someones life because they are clinically insane. The chances of this are near 0 considering how many people are alive at this moment in this country. But If you should happen to need to defend yourself and you do not have the means then tough shit brohan.

If other countries had such a guarantee, it would be safe to say that they would have a gun culture of their own, albeit probably still smaller and notably different in tone due to differences in culture.

The 2nd amendment is essentially a safeguard for all of the other rights enjoyed by Americans. It guarantees the right of armed revolution in the future. It has nothing to do with hunting or sport or self-defense, though these are nice benefits enjoyed as a result. So the ""need"" comment is pointless and not well thought out, really.

The last.fm system is a neat idea, but British rock is being listened to on CD and vinyl all over the world. It's off the grid, unmeasurable and most importantly, very hard to make money from. The record companies make money by keeping everything so current that they need to buy music all the time to keep up.

You know what I think would work? The biggest record companies in the world saying ""there'll be no music this week.

For the Olympics, for me the low point was Atlanta - a place chosen because it is the HQ of Coca Cola and as 100% humid swamp was so unsuitable for athletes that many had to drop out. Conditions were so bad the equestrian events were held in another state entirely.  At Sydney, the Games were reborn and I am totally looking forward to them.

My view is the AA weapons and other ridiculous defences are 90% for show. So long as you allow people personal freedom and privacy terrorism will always be possible - 'easy' perhaps. The measures taken which you've pointed out are ineffective against a guerilla style attack (which is how terrorists operate). If anything, the battleship would be there to create a potential target to distract terrorists from civilian targets (terrorists might see a military target as giving out a better message, and it would be a more 'in your face' display of dominance). 


If a plane does get hijacked its a security failure and people *will* die. The government/security forces can either be seen as responding to the attack (shooting it down) or sitting on their hands. It doesn't really matter how many people die - even if they make it worse, doing something in their minds will be better than doing nothing and appearing weak.

In a free society - there is hardly anything the security forces can do to stop another 7/7. Every city in the UK could be a target, and any one could be a potential terrorist.

&gt;Machine guns need safeties because they are in someones hands at all time.

Uh, trigger discipline.  

&gt;Many law abiding citizens carry and have saved their own lives and many others due to their quick thinking and training in the use of a concealed firearm. There are criminals and the fact that people who want to break the law won't care about gun laws means that gun ownership is part of the right to self defense.

Thank god it's saving your life because you were threatened [especially, statistically if you are shooting a black guy](http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/article1233133.ece).

&gt;Your knowledge of concealed carry is quite hilarious. Fucking armchair soldier. If you don't understand the topic because you have had no experience in the topic, then don't even talk.

Ya know, I never got insulting, or condescending.  Yet, in your attempt to defend your idea of ""shoot to defend yourself"", you get pretty damn insulting.  If there was not an obsessive gun culture in place to even cause the necessity of pulling a gun, which I know the 2nd Amendment guarantees, then it wouldn't be an issue.  The idea of the sacrosanct attitude of the 2nd Amendment is bizzare, considering that every other Amendment to the Constitution has a stack of exceptions to the rule, except this one.  In the 21st Century U.S., what honest reason do you even need a gun for?

Defend yourself?  This isn't the Old West, and most of us don't live in the 9th Ward of New Orleans.

Constitutional Right?  Please, the Constitution clarified the rules of slavery, and that you can be a privateer, two things we dispensed with over 100 years ago.

Threat from the government?  If you feel that your Glock and modified SKS is meant to defend yourself from the government, things went to shit a long time before that point.

Assuming for a moment that the whole ""Carroll could go out on loan"" thing isn't just media speculation, 15m isn't a high enough price, IMO. 20m and I'd consider it. 

However, the most likely scenario here is just that because Rodgers didn't say ""Andy Carroll will be a massive part of our plans this season"" and instead just treated him like many other players in the squad, the media decided to launch that into a story about how he doesn't fit in with Rodgers' plans and is on his way out.

EDIT: This gem from the [Guardian's Rumour Mill](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/jul/11/football-transfer-rumours-liverpool-arsenal):

&gt; Poor Brendan Rodgers. He went to all the trouble of posing for a photograph under the newly rehung 1970s This Is Anfield sign, wielding a claw hammer, the none-too-subtle subtext being ""be reasonable, journalists, you abject shower, or you may find me coming at you in an abrupt fashion at businesslike speed with this"", but already they're starting to twist the poor bugger's words. All he said was that Andy Carroll's a ""very good player"", and that he's going to wait a while before making any major decisions about his squad. But suddenly the faithful, honest, hard-working beast of England is being linked with West Ham United, Fulham, Milan, and Alfred Simmonds of Willingdon.

[9 attacks in 2011](http://www.cougarinfo.org/attacks4.htm).

&gt; rattlesnake

[Between 1960 and 1990](http://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0401/p1367.html) there were 12 fatal bites a year.

I got no statistics for that.  And obviously, those living in wilderness environments do have a higher need in cases like this and [Australian like laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_Australia), make sense in this case.  However, how many people are ever threatened in reality by mountain lions.  According to statistics...9 in 2011.  Not nearly enough to justify.

&gt;Or when I was attacked in a parking lot at the local mall and the cops suggestion was for me to get a gun and next time shoot the fucker in the face, I should just ignore that?

You face the same probability of being attacked with or without a gun.  The likelyhood of your need for a gun decreases with the availability of guns in the hands of criminals...which yes, restricting firearms will reduce that number, just look at England in 2007 [which only had 57 gun related deaths](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/britain-records-18-fall-in-gun-deaths-1232069.html).  Yes, you still have violent crime, but the risk of injury significantly decreases by removing firearms from the equation.

&gt;I love this concept that every place in America is a fucking Starbucks. It's not.

No it's not.  But you also have to ask yourself about where you live.  In mid-town Manhattan, you are not under threat on the same scale you are in say...Juarez, Mexico.  Logically most Americans *have no practical use for owning a firearm*, and the same environment as the ""Wild West"" that exists in Canada, [doesn't reflect the same per capita of gun ownership](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country).

This goes back to my main point.  America is a gun obsessed country.

So, again, I'm confused.  By not showing you are ready to defend yourself you might be attacked, but by open carrying, you increase your chances of being attacked.  So what is the point of carrying at all?

By that regard, by eliminating firearms altogether you significantly decrease your chances of being attacked, as the most likely situation to need that firearm would be in the event of a firearm being used against you, which if guns were illegal would be significantly lower.  The likelihood of you being the sole target of a knife wielding goon only exists on an individual basis and if you put yourself in direct harm.  Of course you could get mugged on the street, but that can also be mitigated by sticking to well lit streets, staying in crowds, and avoiding high crime neighborhoods.",0,1341975426,null,0,false,0,c5can0j,t3_wc5m3,t1_c5can0j,t1_c5cag83,null,1429346549,-2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,-2

As for the tank in Time Square, An armed populace can mount a relatively effective insurgency even when horribly outgunned. For a recent example, see Iraq and Afghanistan. The shotgun and pistol are not irrelevant when they're wielded by a highly motivated force using guerilla tactics. What is the tank going to do now that it's parked in Time Square? Start opening fire on apartment blocks, thus turning public opinion further in favor of the rebels? The tank is only useful in open conflict. No one with half a brain is going to rush a machine-gun nest or rush a tank column with their shotgun or pistol.

1) It requires two forwards which doesn't suit Torres in the slightest. He's proven many times over that he is best utilized as the focal point of a single striker system. 

2) Part of what makes the diamond successful is having two capable wingers to play wide of the CAM (much like malouda and joe cole when Ancelotti rolled with the diamond). But Piazon, Hazard, Mata and Oscar all prefer to play centrally and the diamond really only has one CM position (excluding the CDM role, which none of the above would operate in). 

These are two glaring issues that would render the diamond ineffective with our current squad makeup. Some variation of the 4-3-3 still seems likely, but I would prefer a variation of the 4-2-3-1. This would allow a DM/CM combo (ie a deep lying play maker alongside the DM) behind two wide players and a CAM who plays behind the striker. It would allow Mikel to partner with Lamps/Oscar and Hazard and Rams to play wide of Mata through the middle behind Torres.

I think that hosting the Olympics is a mug's game - I just can't imagine that the cost is ever recovered. ""Tourism"" and the spending of the visiting nations are a drop in the ocean.

Bidding on the Olympics is a political no-lose situation for the party who makes the pitch, because the bidding is done 10 years (??) in advance, and by the time the event is actually held the opposition will be in power to take the flack for it. So when bidding to host the Olympics the costs of hosting only look like a benefit - they'll help undermine your political opponents. 

In this game, the exclusivity commands a premium - the sponsors will pay more to be the only one in their category.

how do you suppose that happens without the populace being armed? Do they just march up to the local police station or military base and ask real nicely that they provide some weapons? Or do you think only the police or military should be in a position to begin such a conflict? If so, why? Without the populace being armed, they are ultimately beholden to the interests of the police and/or military, who would ultimately be the ones ENFORCING such a theoretical police state.

In the event of a police state, the only thing that has a chance at keeping America free or restoring freedom to America would be the application of force to oust the government or whatever it is that is imposing that police state. Without arms, such an endeavor is doomed to fail. If those arms cannot be obtained without begging police or military or some other power, a revolution or civil war will never start without the police or military instigating it, because no one is stupid enough to go ask the police or military for weapons for use in their revolutionary cause.

With this in mind why do you think public elections for such people is ever going to be a good idea? Wouldn't it be better for the top universities of the country to nominate and elect Lords from their faculties? I think it's impossible to expect the general populace, or even elected politicians, to correctly choose people capable of holding a position to the high standard of judgement it should require without bias. And that bias will ultimately be decided by a popularity race, maintained either by the media (Murdoch's vote) or through party allegiance (MP's vote). At least if the source of the vote was of people with a high degree of academic achievement, you could at least expect the elected to be competent.

Steven Moffat (who wrote both those stories) left open the possibility there may have been another meeting of the two between those two stories, but if there was, we don't know about it.

P.S.: another useful thing to remember is they're not meeting in strictly reverse order but random order, the result of both of them being constant time travelers.  In the Library, River knows all about the Doctor and he knows nothing about her.  Some other occasion will be her first time meeting him, and he'll know much more about her than she knows about him.

That during Gallifrey's past in matriarchal times (with Pythia as our matriarch) Gallifreyans could reproduce naturally. But then when Pythia was overthrown she cursed Gallifrey and made people unable to reproduce. It just wouldn't work. And then comes ol' Rassilon, taking power and dealing with this potential population crisis by inventing looms and regeneration. He invents Time Lords and Ladies and Houses and literally creates Time Lord society. For elites. And clearly you need to be able to regenerate to be a Time Lord/Lady. And as 11 says, exposure to the time vortex is important (and the ability to withstand it). And then, I don't think River is really a Time Lady. She can regenerate but that's the only Time Lady ability she displayed and it's gone now. And she's not culturally Gallifreyan/Time Lord which I think is important to have to be considered an actual Time Lady/Lord. Even if she may possess time sensitive powers (of which we haven't seen any yet). So regeneration, schism, and culture are things I think are required to be a Time Lord/Lady. Plus other dubious things we don't necessarily know about that we probably would know about if we knew more about Time Lord/Lady culture.

These were largely non-violent revolutions, this is the step you attempt before you start picking up guns, if you choose to pick them up at all. The Romanians had a slightly different fate, but their revolution was only successful because the military defected and the leader was delusional and idiotic. There are many instances of unarmed protestors being met with military force and many dying. With guns, these people could do more than just march and hope to run away and survive when the military came to crush their protests.

&gt;Czech revolt of 1968

""The reforms, especially the decentralization of administrative authority, were not received well by the Soviets, who, after failed negotiations, sent thousands of Warsaw Pact troops and tanks to occupy the country. A large wave of emigration swept the nation. While there were many non-violent protests in the country, including several suicides by self-immolation, there was no military resistance. Czechoslovakia remained occupied until 1990.""

22 years of occupation. Such a great success story for unarmed revolution.

&gt;Hungarian revolt of 1956

""After announcing a willingness to negotiate a withdrawal of Soviet forces, the Politburo changed its mind and moved to crush the revolution. On the 4th of November, a large Soviet force invaded Budapest and other regions of the country. Hungarian resistance continued until 10 November. Over 2,500 Hungarians and 700 Soviet troops were killed in the conflict, and 200,000 Hungarians fled as refugees. Mass arrests and denunciations continued for months thereafter. By January 1957, the new Soviet-installed government had suppressed all public opposition. These Soviet actions alienated many Western Marxists, yet strengthened Soviet control over Central Europe.""

Another inspiring story of revolution! :-/

&gt;But who is resisting? Neo-nazi's? Fundamentalist Christians? Hispanics? Blacks? Whites? Southern separatists? Texas nationalists? The reincarnation of George Washington? 

Irrelevant, really. given that your hypothetical scenario was a police state, I'd assume it's some faction that doesn't like living in a police state. They have the potential to restore or reform the government however they'd like if they manage to succeed. That mean there's hope for America to restore itself to its previous condition, whatever that would be.

&gt;By the time we got to the second amendment, we would have forgone every other amendment, every concept of seperation of powers, even habeus corpus would have been thrown out, with Americans probably letting it whither and die in the process, making whatever was left a cheap impression, much like the Gothic kings sitting on the Roman throne in 500 A.D. 

What makes you think that this is the only possible scenario? That people will only pick up arms once every other piece of the Constitution has been tossed out? The 2nd amendment could theoretically be exercised at any time. The Constitution could be 100% in tact and people could decide they want a revolution. The Constitution could theoretically only be partially modified or ""damaged"", like say the government decided to trash an amendment, potentially without going through normal procedures (or they just ignore it, as a more likely option). The Constitution does not need to be burned and utterly torn apart by the government in order for people to be potentially willing to use force to fight for what they believe in.",0,1341982462,null,0,false,0,c5cccih,t3_wc5m3,t1_c5cccih,t1_c5cbp7g,null,1429347411,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Their revolution succeeded until the Soviets intervened.

&gt;Another inspiring story of revolution! :-/

Again, acted upon by the Soviet Union, a force capable of crushing both nations without effort.  You missed the point, the revolutions succeeded until an outside force acted.

&gt;What makes you think that this is the only possible scenario?

Because no nation has ever undergone a revolution/Civil War and maintained itself in the same state.  You might say ""English Civil War"" but the powers of the King were so diminished after the Restoration that the England of Charles I was not the England of Charles II, much less of John II.

Your alternate scenarios that ""revolution could happen at any point"" doesn't hold true as history has shown Americans abhor domestic unrest, as seen in how quickly groups as various as the Peace Movement to Occupy to Labor lost popularity when they became involved in unrest.  A great example of popular resistance losing support is the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago.  That virtually ended the popular peace movement and resulted in a widely supported crackdown by civil authorities, despite the disapproval of police brutality.

&gt;The Constitution does not need to be burned and utterly torn apart by the government in order for people to be potentially willing to use force to fight for what they believe in.

No it doesn't, just the idea that popular sentiment and democracy work, or even more disturbing, that it does to a groups dislike.  Either way, the idea of America is broken, and when a nation enters into unrest, it does not come out the same again, often times in unrecognizable ways...aka Russian Revolution of 1918, Irish War of Independance, Popular uprising against the Kaiser, French Revolution, Chinese Civil War, Somalia, etc.

true,FinalSonicX,tardis,TARDIS,"&gt;Their revolution succeeded until the Soviets intervened.

Meaning that the revolution ultimately failed. If your revolutionary government is crushed and your country is occupied for 22 years, your revolution has FAILED.

&gt;Because no nation has ever undergone a revolution/Civil War and maintained itself in the same state.

Sure, since that's the whole idea of a revolution. In your hypothetical scenario, some people decide to try to overthrow the police state. If they succeed, one might assume that they'll try to instate a new government that looks a lot less like a police state. If they're American, they might look to the Constitution when drawing up a new charter for the nation, or they might not. The possibility exists for a revolution or civil war to break out to restore aspects of a nation, such as certain rights we as Americans tend to value. ""America"" in the formal sense could be dead in that scenario, but the principles might outlive it by quite a long time.

Americans might abhor domestic unrest because they don't believe that a revolution or civil war is warranted under many circumstances. the Peace Movement and Occupy are hardly examples I would use to suggest that Americans on the whole would never rebel before the constitution had literally been shredded. In a police-state scenario like the one you presented, I think things would easily come to a head. Let's say the government decides the 1st amendment no longer applies - no freedom of speech, religion, or assembly. There is now a state mandated religion, you may be arrested for anti-government speech, and no people may assemble in groups of more than 4 people without a state-issued permit. This is established by law passed by congress, signed by the President, and somehow the Supreme Court deems it constitutional. You don't think anything would happen? Nothing at all?

Anyways, my original point was that the gun culture that exists in America is not merely because of our history on the frontier, but also because our constitution explicitly allows it to exist. If other countries had guarantees like the 2nd amendment, it's probable that they would have a gun culture of their own. It might not be a cowboy culture, but it would be a gun culture nonetheless.

My other point was that Americans DO have a potential need for firearms, and in any case a ""need"" is completely unnecessary to exercise a right. Your suggestions that the revolutions in eastern europe against communist regimes are examples of successful revolutions without the use of guns are most certainly NOT successful, with the exception of non-violent revolutions and the Romanian revolution. In the Romanian's case, the military defected to their side and the oppressive leader was delusional and idiotic.",0,1341985316,null,0,false,0,c5ccxfz,t3_wc5m3,t1_c5ccxfz,t1_c5ccivo,null,1435701899,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

1.  We should ban cigarettes because they are dangerous to people's health, even though they were not designed to be that way.

2.  We should ban guns because they were initially designed to kill, and we should ignore the 1.5 to 2.5 million times a year they save lives. The 600 cops a year that are saved by shooting a criminal should be allowed to die.

3.  We should not ban cars even though about the same number of people are killed by cars as guns, and countless more are injured.  Your argument seems to be that because cars were designed for a noble purpose, we should ignore this death rate.

4.  Even though doctors are the third leading cause of death, that is perfectly acceptable because they don't intend to kill people.  Even though some 250,000 people die each year from iatrogenic causes, we should not address this and instead should focus on the 30,000 people who die from guns (half of which are at the hands of a criminal).

Your argument seems to be that needless death, in an of itself, is not a problem, but HOW people die is.  It is okay for doctors, nurses and hospitals to kill people (100 times more than guns), it is acceptable for people to kill others using a car, but it is NOT acceptable to kill people using a gun. You would prefer people jump to their deaths or overdose instead of the thousands of times they kill themselves using a gun.

I wouldn't go that far!  However, it's certain they don't want to be caught out in a lie.  There've been rumours circulating for decades about the various ways in which they might be literally speaking the truth about the 100% beef content whilst cutting corners.  e.g. There was an urban legend for a long time about them purchasing from companies called ""The 100% American Beef Company"" etc., and these have pretty much been debunked.  However, it is interesting to note how carefully they word their statements of ingredients, most interestingly how they are very country-specific i.e. in countries where the regulations and labelling requirements are strict, I don't doubt that they play the game and proudly announce that they do (regardless of the fact they couldn't not do so!)  But if you trust that the ingredients are equally as ""wholesome"" in a developing world country with no regulations or restrictions on advertising, then you're a braver person than I.  Frankly, I've seen how ""model"" Western corporations play once they're off the Anglo-European leash, and it's not pretty.

true,eternalkerri,dalek,Dalek,"&gt;We should ban cigarettes because they are dangerous to people's health, even though they were not designed to be that way.

Only in the past few decades have we learned that.  Guns were obviously always dangerous.

&gt;We should ban guns because they were initially designed to kill, and we should ignore the 1.5 to 2.5 million times a year they save lives.

Wow, that's a huge statistic I have to doubt because I have a Time article that says between [half and three quarter a million](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,152446,00.html).

&gt; The 600 cops a year that are saved by shooting a criminal should be allowed to die.  

Who said to take the guns away from cops?  Additionally how many of those cops shot a criminal with a gun?

&gt;We should not ban cars even though about the same number of people are killed by cars as guns, and countless more are injured.

Because overall statistically, people operate cars more safely, must be used negligently to kill, and have more than one use.  A guns sole use is to fire a lethal projectile at another object.

&gt;Your argument seems to be that because cars were designed for a noble purpose, we should ignore this death rate.

A cars intended purpose is not to launch a lethal projectile.  Yes, you can drown in a pool, but its purpose is not to drown in.

&gt;Even though doctors are the third leading cause of death, that is perfectly acceptable because they don't intend to kill people.

For a doctor to cause death he has to be negligent or unable to treat the illness or injury.  Additionally, according to the CDC [doctors are not the 3rd leading cause of death](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lcod.htm/), chronic lower resperatory diseases are:  pneumonia, asthma, emphysema (leading cause cigarettes).  There is no truth to the ""doctors are the third leading cause of death"".  It's patently false.  Additionally, the largest statistic often cited is *unpreventable reaction to drug treatments*, essentially that it was unpredictable that they would die from a reaction, hence, not a deliberate act.  Do not cite false information.


&gt;Your argument seems to be that needless death, in an of itself, is not a problem, but HOW people die is. It is okay for doctors, nurses and hospitals to kill people (100 times more than guns)

Your argument is based upon an incorrect statistic.  

&gt;it is acceptable for people to kill others using a car, but it is NOT acceptable to kill people using a gun.

People who negligently operate a motor vehicle and kill another person are punished all the time.  However they have to have been * deliberately* negligent in the operation of a car, of which [Americans travel billions of miles yearly](http://www.bts.gov/programs/national_household_travel_survey/daily_travel.html), while seemingly high, for the amount of usage the fatality rates are amazingly low.

Your argument is:

1) Based on false information.

Precisely. Without arms, a violent revolution is doomed to fail without the support of SOMEONE who is armed, like the military or police. Except that in a police-state scenario like the one you proposed, the police and military are the ones who enforce the police state. So I guess without guns you hope your nonviolent revolution works and if it fails you hope that the military sides with your faction because otherwise you're just going to get shot or imprisoned.

&gt;To argue that because a 200+ year old law written under completely alien circumstances is a good enough reason

That IS a good enough reason, by the law. That's the way the constitution works. you cannot bypass the Constitution. If you wish to change it, there's a specific process for that.

Doesn't negate my point, nor reinforce yours.

&gt;And I would dare say far more people are endangered by people talking on phones and texting than guns.

Which is why we have banned cell phones and texting while driving, two activities which do not mix...negligent use.  Most gun deaths are deliberate use of the purpose of the firearm.  Most automobile deaths are caused by *improper use*.  We don't ban toasters because people use them improperly, you can't criminalize stupidity.

&gt;so we should ignore the millions of guns in use each day without incident?

So millions of guns in America are removed from their holsters, loaded, the safeties removed and fired daily without incident?  That would require millions of gun owners firing their guns daily.  That means that the likelihood of gun range use would be on par with the number of people going to McDonalds daily, and well, that means lines outside the door to use the range, or millions of people in the woods shooting their guns.  

To use a gun, you have to actually fire the weapon.  Having it sit on the tabletop or under your seat is not using it.  To use the gun, it has to be firing a bullet.  That means statistically, there would be *more* accidental fatalities than there currently are.

And like I said, at that point the America people would revolting for has long passed and cannot return.

&gt;tyranny is en ever-present threat.

In 200+ years we have had no kings, no dictators, and no warlords because of voting.  I don't think its as omnipresent as you think it is.

&gt;you seem to have an odd amount of contempt for a 200+ year old ""law"" that you swore to uphold and protect.

Because the intent and era it was relevant has passed.  The logical need for you to own a firearm has passed.  There are no frontier Indians and we have a permanent state run military and many states still have what could be technically called a militia (state guards).  In 21st Century America, what can you honestly explain as a valid reason other than ""tyranny"" can you give for firearms to still be owned by common citizens?  Self-defense?  Easily performed by readily and easily available non-lethal methods.  Criminals?  England had 57 gun related homicides just two years ago in a nation of 62 million...think about that statistic, you are more likely to be struck by lightening in England than shot to death by a criminal.

&gt; So I guess we can just toss out the rest of the bill of rights because it's part of that same 200+ year old document?

If people are so ready to dispense with Biblical law because we find it irrelevant in modern times when it *might* be inspired by God, why are we so sacrosanct about a document we *know for a fact* was written by men who are fallible and wrote for their specific time?

No, your argument is based on ONE possible scenario. It is possible for tyranny to arise without trashing the entirety of the Constitution. you continually sidestep this point and instead insist that if revolution has come, America and some of its core principles could never survive. If, tomorrow by some strange series of circumstances, a law was declared that essentially negated the 1st amendment by establishing a state religion, strictly controlling speech, and prohibiting aqssemblies of citizens in groups of 3 or more without a state-issued permit, America  has not ""long passed"", and it could very well ""return"" if citizens are active and attempt to reverse that action. The point at which revolution could occur is not restricted only to the point where the constitution has been literally nullified in whole and American belief in Constitutional principles has evaporated.

&gt;In 200+ years we have had no kings, no dictators, and no warlords because of voting. I don't think its as omnipresent as you think it is.

Had you ever considered that we might vote for a tyrant? We've done a good job so far. Our previous successes do not preclude the possibility that we might be subject to tyranny in the future. We do not always make perfect decisions. Would you rather be disarmed in such a scenario?

&gt;In 21st Century America, what can you honestly explain as a valid reason other than ""tyranny"" can you give for firearms to still be owned by common citizens?

As I've stated before, one does not need to demonstrate any need or any reason to exercise a right. Need isn't even part of the equation. Regardless, I see no reason why tyranny is an unacceptable answer. Tyranny is a possibility. If the powers behind that tyranny refuse to yield to non-violent options, then force is the only option to end the tyranny. So you either have a violent revolution or you let the tyranny continue. In a violent revolution, without arms or the aid of the military (you know, the one probably enforcing the tyranny of the police state in your hypothetical scenario), you are going to lose.

&gt;If people are so ready to dispense with Biblical law because we find it irrelevant in modern times when it might be inspired by God, why are we so sacrosanct about a document we know for a fact was written by men who are fallible and wrote for their specific time?

Because the Constitution is US Law. Biblical Law is not US Law. the Constitution forms the basis for how the federal government functions and it establishes boundaries for the government. Like I said, the 2nd amendment is law. If you would like to see it changed, there is a rather specific process for going about that.

I've seen this ""mistake"" pointed out so many times on Reddit in the past. I've not seen it discussed so much recently, but I have an idea it used to be almost a  cause célèbre here on this site.
  
I kinda think that in this matter we have to accept that there are two usages. 

No one ever uses the term to mean ""you're making this logical fallacy"" outside of university classes (whichever ones cover logical fallacies).

So to me the distinction is unclear or confusing to no one. I appreciate that you may feel the language is losing a useful distinction, but the ""raises the question"" usage is so widespread (and surely has been for a long time?) that it's now too late to stop it. 

I might care to agree with you and amend my ways, but for every person as educated and open to correction as I am, there are 1000 ill-educated louts who don't know or care the difference. You might argue that I put myself in the loutish category should I refuse to mend my ways - you might be right in judging my character, but I'm not sure about this reasoning.

iv) want good , friendly , non aggressive and hygienic service ? - try the automated checkouts . And watch out for all the rip offs .

I asked this question of people to see if anybody would admit to downvoting things that go against reddiquette. There are people who do. I mean three people downvoted this post. It's a bit off topic but you can also relate it to Doctor Who. Of course I think you can relate *anything* to Doctor Who. Seriously.

Anyways, I'm getting off topic. I vigorously downvote reposts or memes or posts  of things that are supposed to *remind* us of aspects of the show. i.e. Hey doesn't this cat in a fez remind you of 11? Or does this pencil have Gallifreyan on it?

No, just post an actual picture of 11 or Gallifreyan. Or better, just talk about how awesome they are in a self post.

Hmm I never downvote repost questions about how to get into the show or classic Who. Maybe I should but I don't. I get too excited about the idea of someone getting into DW.

edit: also sometimes I upvote things I don't like because they got more downvotes than I think they deserve. i.e. someone put labor into making their own TARDIS cake and it looks like crap.

There are all sorts of geopolitical reasons for that, which may or may not be related to ""our way of life"" or ""our nation as a whole"", depending on your political perspective, such as securing cheap energy.  But there's no doubt at all in my mind, that the Anglo-American military (and intelligence services) agenda frequently has had much more to do with protecting and advancing corporate interests by overturning truculent regimes (and thereby cowing others), fomenting dissent, forcing open some markets, whilst defending or closing others, and limiting the influence of unaligned or unfriendly powers in doing the same.  There are many historical examples I can list if you want me to, but it's a long and inglorious history of imperialism that led us to our position at the top table (which we retain by our finger-tips) - one such example would be the virtual destruction of the Indian textile trade, together with enforced ruralisation, to ensure the British cotton industry dominated global markets.  Obviously, these days it's mostly up to the US to pull these stunts, which is why they're currently top dog in global trade.

We kick off again with the CPS continuing the cross examination of Terry

CPS:  ""Are you sure Ferdinand said to you, ""..calling me a black cunt"" to which Terry responds ""Yes""

There's a man outside court in a Coors sponsored Chelsea shirt, a Chelsea blanket/poncho and the 5 foot high JT cutout. Lad. Queue for the public viewing gallery was the longest to date

CPS: Sure you heard the words ""shagging bridge's misses'' and ""calling me a black cunt?'' Terry: ""Sure""

CPS: Attempting to show that JT was not just repeating AF's phrase and it was of his own volition. CPS arguing that adding the word 'fucking' as an adjective is the key indicator of guilt. I'm not sure about this as, speaking as someone with an often colourful vocabulary, my friends and I often add the word 'fucking' in to a sentence.   
eg. ""Did you skip the football to go to the ballet?"", with a repetitive response being ""No I didn't skip the football to go to the fucking ballet"". Not that unusual to me

CPS: JT said he didn't hear the gesture about missus shagging on the pitch, according to his statement to the FA. Now claiming that JT has changed his story to say that he did hear and see the gesture on the pitch. Using slow motion replays to determine this

CPS: JT said 'fuck' 4 times in 8 seconds, a pretty rapid pace of swearing. Gordon Ramsay would be impressed

CPS: Asks Terry if he actually said to Ferdinand `I've shagged your missus as well'' before making 'black cunt' remark. Terry says 'no'

CPS: **This is in bold due to importance. The prosecution has revealed their key point and conclusion, finally. They are arguing that the exchange happened as follows...  
""You shagged your mates missus you cunt""  
""Yeah and I shagged yours too you fucking black cunt""**

CPS: Trying to show that AF pushed JT over the edge and the statement was in anger, not repetitive

JT: ""Nobody in this room can tell me what I've heard..there's no video on Anton, it's on me, that's unfortunate"" and ""why would this incident tip me over the edge when I've heard it (goading over Bridge) a million times before?""

JT: ""I have heard what I have heard on the pitch, you can't tell me what I have heard.""

CPS: JT says meeting with AF happened 20 mins after game, AF says 45 mins. Terry disagrees

CPS: ""Why didn’t you want to take it further, people accusing you of being racist?""  
JT: ""I knew there was nothing out there that could show I did anything wrong""

JT: I was keen to go forward with FA &amp; police statement. If I had something to hide I would have been thinking 'Shit'

JT: Says the first thing he attempted to do was call Ferdinand, not talk to PR or the FA. Says Rio wouldn't take his call. This is after CPS suggests JT is all about PR and understands the need to get his story out asap

JT: Asks CPS if Mikel heard anything, CPS says that in Mikel's statement he notes crowd noise obscured his hearing

CPS: Asking Terry why AF would make a false allegation, JT replies he doesn't know. Ignoring the fact that this was all started by the cop not Anton and AF's brother Rio stood to gain the England captaincy. JT keeping quiet

11:30

Ashley Cole in the house

JT: Only been sent off 4 times in 600 games. Keeping his head is why he's captain

JT: Been goaded about affair hundreds of times by players, and more about his mum. Some pretty distateful things sung by Liverpool fans etc..

JT: Immune to abuse about affair and even his family at this stage. Never been sent off for rising, only for bad/last man challenges

JT: It was an instinctive response to repeat it, never been accused of that so was shocked. JT is all done now and Ashley Cole is next on the stand

You can't have it both ways. If a gun is only a problem when being fired, then you should have no objection to people wearing a sidearm -- because they aren't using it. That means that millions and millions of guns are owned but never ""used"" by your definition and, as you pointed out,  only statistically a tiny fraction which cause problems. The vast majority -- 99.99% of guns are owned and never used so cannot cause a problem. It is the rare and stupid gun owner who is deliberately acting negligently which is causing the problems and we have laws in place to deal with him. This is the same as the statistically small number if people who use a car illegally and hurt another.

By your own argument, 10's of millions of firearms in the public's possession are never causing a problem since they are not ""used"" by your definition.  You want to ban something which you admit isn't a problem until it is used negligently -- but don't want to ban other items which cause more death and injury if also used negligently.

So yes, it does negate your point.

AC: Says he see's Terry socially on an infrequent basis, they play the odd round of golf. Friends with AF and RF

AC: Awkward position and he told his lawyer he did not want to get involved

This Ashley Cole testimony will swing the case. Thankfully he's a defence not prosecution witness

GCS QC: Ask AC if he's ever seen JT lose his head over affair talk. AC says no, they joke about it because he's been through the exact same situation before. ""JT is calm and collected while other's are not""

AC: Don't remember if AVB even spoke to the players at half time at the QPR match. Nice, that's why we loved you AVB

On a lighter note, from the forums: ""Bear in mind folks, this could be the most sensationally elaborate merk ever. Rio is about to jump out from behind the stand, fake beard, glasses and a long mac on (Beadle 1992 style) and scream ""AAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!"" whilst laughing and disrobing""

Magistrate : Would you please stand Mr Cole?  
AC: I'd prefer to sit

Twitter: ""HE sits when he wants, he sits when he waaaannnntsss, Ashley Cole, he'll sit when he wants!""

12:15 AC: **Huge news. Ashley says he thinks he heard Anton say ""Bridge"", ""Black"" and ""C-U-N-T"". Yes he spelt it out, the mag told him not to be shy and he can say ""Cunt"". AC replies ""I'm not shy"". I can't believe I'm writing this**

So as we stand AC has dropped the key line, he's corroborating JT's side of events, Anton said it first. AF claimed he never said the word 'black'

AC: I did not shake AF's hand after the game as I couldn't believe what he'd done. This is his long time friend he is talking about, devastating testimony

GCS QC: Ashley Cole asked by defence if he could remember more abt Terry-Ferdinand conversation. ""No, I was looking forward to going on a night out""

Twitter: ""Another last ditch goal-line clearance by Ash!"" Brilliant

GCS QC: Asks AC to explain his open-mouthed reaction to AF's words, ""I was either hot or not happy about the words he was saying"". I get the impression AC is taking the piss a little bit, clearly does not want to be here

AC: ""I could have said more in FA statement"". Implies he held back due to long term friendship with the Ferdinands

12:30 : Cross examination of AC begins

CPS: ""As Chelsea captain, he shouldn't be disrespected like that should he?"". AC says ""It's got nothing to do with that"". This attempted winding up by saying Terry is captain and should be respected hasn't worked on Terry or AC, not sure why they are persisting with it

AC: ""I didn't hear Terry say anything"". Concedes he didn't hear AF say the words Bridge, black and cunt exactly but that he was so close he saw his lips mouth the words

CPS: AC you knew there was a problem after the game. AC ""How could we? There's no phone reception in the dressing rooms at Loftus Road""

CPS: ""You and JT quickly got AF in to the dressing room to try and smooth it over, you knew it was going to be trouble"". AC ""No idea what you're talking about. I put my feet in ice and had a shower""

CPS: ""Was it just handbags?"". AC says ""We shouldn't be sitting here, personally""

true,[deleted],null,null,"Only that's exactly what the Remploy model was supposed to do, that was their own goal.  To deliver meaningful work and to afford genuine independence, but less than half the factories are viable.  The average Remploy job is subsidised by £25k a year, and they're not all disabled either.  If a factory has so much subsidy, when the government agrees to act as guarantor on its debt, when the government then advises every government office and department to have at least one Remploy contract, and when a Remploy factory still only breaks even then they're not even giving people meaningful work.   The factories in trouble must literally not be rolling anything off the production line for large parts of the day.

In the meantime other industry representatives have said that they could help those disabled people into regular industrial work, in financially viable factories, for a fraction of the cost.  

- Disabled groups have come forward in favour of the new plan.   Disability Rights UK actually claims to have been campaigning for it for a long time!

- It means the surviving Remploy factories will be more viable.

- The Government has accepted the findings of the Sayce Review and announced a 15% increase in the Access To Work budget to help industry create those jobs, which they say they can and who have a far more effective and cost efficient record.   

People like Len McCluskey and Liam Byrne are whipping this up to something it's not.

When you're susbsidisng a factory to the tune of nearly 50% of operational costs, giving them government contracts, paying for set up and covering every job to the tune of £25k and still barely break even then something else has to be tried because it simply isn't working.  Those factories that do have potential are staying open.

Traditionally, electrolysis was used - splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity - but this is quite energy-intensive and thus expensive.

One of my colleagues is working on what is essentially a reverse fuel cell that catalytically splits water into hydrogen and oxygen much more efficiently than electrolysis (as opposed to a fuel cell that splits hydrogen into protons and electrons, then reacts them with oxygen on the other side to produce water).

true,daveduckman,null,null,"All tickets go on sale in a tiered system where they're first made available to members who've seen previous fixtures and then downwards until whatever's left over is sold as general sale. At the very least you need to be a member to get tickets to a match, all except the earliest round FA Cup matches against lower league teams sell out.

Visit the website to see when tickets will be on sale for your respective tier (ie. member) and if you buy tickets right at the crack of dawn on the first time they're available, you should have no problems for smaller games like the vs Reading. 

As for the merseyside derby, you won't get tickets to that game through normal sale. It's open to season ticket holders and those who've been to away games first, and it easily gets sold out before it gets to general members.


You have a few options for matches you won't get through general sale:

1. Most recommended is that you buy one of the LFC official hospitality patches. It costs a lot more but it is still generally cheaper than a scalper and infinitely more reliable. You know exactly where your seat is, you get some sort of bells and whistles and most importantly, your ticket is definitely real. I'd go for the Thomas Cook one which bundles accommodation with the ticket and a program. The benefit here is that they go on sale a fair bit earlier than most tickets and so if you're quick, you can snap them up (possibly even for the everton match). The other hospitality packages over lunch or something like that. tbh, if you're going to anfield for the first time, you don't want to sit through their song and dance, you just want to get to your seat 45-60 min before the game and see the build up (especially if its for the everton game).

2. Your other option is using one of those ticket resale websites that spawn across the internet. The one i used when I wasn't a scouser is this site http://www.livefootballtickets.com/. It proved reliable the 2-3 times I've needed to use it but there are certainly no guarantees. Read the seating carefully and be prepared to pay through the nose (2-4x the price of a normal ticket). Assume the seat you'll get is the worst in the described area. Always get Cat A (cat B seats are attrocious) and avoid the anfield road stand (there's a chance you'll be sitting with the away fans). 

3. Of all the people I've seen wandering round the ground saying ""have you got any spares?"", I've never once seen an actual scalper at work near the ground. That's not to say I was trying to find them, but I'd say that if you're trying to get a ticket on match day, you're going to be disappointed. 

I wrote some advice for someone who was going to anfield for the first time a while back.

Step forward Ian Barlow, who has built a career on tax scheming every bit as contrived as comedian Jimmy Carr's dodge — but far more costly to the UK.

Barlow was head of tax at accountancy firm KPMG from 1993 until 2001 and then became senior partner in London until 2008. Over this period he was directly responsible for selling some of the most aggressive tax avoidance schemes on the market, many of them already exposed by the Eye. Here is a taste of some that made it into the courts...

•	In 2000, KPMG set up a £4m-a-year VAT dodge for a fruit machine company called RAL Holdings, a management buy-out from the Rank empire. Under the scheme machines in 127 amusement arcades were leased to a Guernsey subsidiary. The idea was to escape ""output tax"", even though the machines continued to be used in Britain, while still reclaiming the ""input tax"" they attracted. Internal KPMG papers admitted: ""In our view HM Customs &amp; Excise will regard these planning arrangements as 'unacceptable tax avoidance' and will seek to challenge the arrangements"". It did; and the courts sided with the taxman.

•	Later the same year the firm orchestrated what was known as a ""round the world"" scheme in which the former chairman of privatised train company FirstGroup, Trevor Smallwood, sold his shares in the company through a trust that, KPMG claimed, moved from Jersey to Mauritius and back to the UK in the same tax year to exploit a loophole in capital gains tax rules. ""The whole point.., was to sell the shares and to realise the gain and to avoid tax on the gain,"" explained a tribunal. The courts concluded that the trust in fact never left KPMG's Bristol office and the scheme failed.

•	Early in 2001, with Barlow still at the tax helm, KPMG put a wealthy client, dotcom entrepreneur Jason Drummond, into a complex scheme to shelter a multi-million pound gain. The plan involved buying rights to other people's life insurance policies before surrendering them, creating tax losses that would wipe out Drummond's otherwise taxable gains. So impressed was KPMG and its tax boss Barlow that, in the words of a tax tribunal, they adopted it as ""a preferred strategy for their
clients"". Tribunal chairman Stephen Oliver QC was less bowled over. The scheme had ""no purpose... other than the facilitation of the tax avoidance strategy"" in which the players were ""acting out a charade"". The courts duly rejected the scheme.

•	Early in 2002, the firm was at it again, flogging an immensely complex scheme involving loans to offshore trusts which were then traded at losses to offset the taxable incomes of 64 punters led by property big shot Graham Edwards and totalling £156m. A tax tribunal concluded: ""The scheme is entirely artificial and the appellants had no commercial purposes in entering into it other than generating an artificial loss to set against taxable income"". Again it was rejected by the courts, and Barlow and KPMG were beginning to look like not just aggressive tax avoiders, but incompetent ones at that.

•	It wasn't just wealthy individuals KPMG was keen to help dodge their dues. The firm was also a consultant to Barclays on some of its most aggressive schemes, including a 2007 cross-border scam codenamed Project Brontos over which bankers are currently facing prosecution in Italy.
To complete the picture, Barlow arrives at HMRC with an ongoing conflict of interest. He is a non-executive director of PA Consulting, which is currently locked in legal battle with HMRC over an offshore trust scheme.
As a dyed-in-the-wool tax dodger, before it became unfashionable he wasn't shy about it. ""There is no meaningful distinction to be drawn between acceptable tax planning and unacceptable tax avoidance,"" he declared in 1999. ""Tax is an artificial construct of legislation. If parliament deems something unacceptable, it can legislate against it. What is left is acceptable."" Exploiting loopholes, however, artificial is fair game: so no room for ""moral repugnance"" there. What next? Bob Diamond for the Bank of England no doubt...

Avoiding the truth

SERIOUS trouble could be brewing for top brass at HM Revenue &amp; Customs — including outgoing tax boss Dave Hartnett — over its dodgy tax deals, as MPs on the public accounts committee refuse to do what they are supposed to and give up after they have been repeatedly stonewalled.
After telling the National Audit Office (NAO) to look more closely at the infamous Vodafone and Goldman Sachs tax settlements with the help of retired judge Sir Andrew Park (see last Eye), the MPs summoned Hartnett and HMRC's new permanent secretary, Lin Homer, to explain glaring inconsistencies in accounts of the deals.

The principal concern over the multi-billion pound Vodafone let-off was that Hartnett had agreed a cosy deal with its finance director Andy
Halford without consulting his specialists or lawyers on the chances of winning the argument over the offshore scheme in the courts.

This was at best a monumental dereliction and it was one Hartnett and his chief lawyer Anthony Inglese have been desperate to cover up since the Eye first exposed it. To do so, they have repeated mantra-like what they thought was a winning obfuscation: that ""lawyers were involved throughout"" the case. Hartnett first used the line to answer Tory Treasury select committee member Jesse Norman last yew and Inglese repeated it three times when asked by Tory PAC niember Stephen Barclay last November whether lawyers advised on the settlement.

The formulation now looks too clever by half, since with Park's help the NAO reported that HMRC ""did not seek legal advice on whether the [Vodafone dispute] should be settled, or on the terms on which it should be settled. Lawyers were not involved throughout the settlement negotiations..."" Clearly lawyers were not involved throughout, which as PAC chairman Margaret Hodge noted, puts Inglese in a spot of bother. His statements were made after he had been put on an oath to tell ""the whole truth"" because Hodge's committee was fed up with the taxmen's prevarications.

Lin Homer, fudger-in-chief, tried unsuccessfully to make out that it was all semantics. She was put down by Tory member Richard Bacon — ""This is not one of those areas where a lot of angels need to do a lot of dancing on the head of a pin"" — before Hodge floated ""a possible reference to the attorney- general"" over Inglese's evidence and a dark veil was drawn over the matter, for now.

Similar concerns emerged over Hartnett's risible claim, again to Jesse Norman, that ""we did not collect a penny less from Vodafone than we thought we could"". Even the NAO conceded that the eventual deal was ""lower than the tax liability that would have been established if the depaitment won in litigation"". Hartnett now claimed: ""I was referring to the amount of cash we were collecting."" This was highly improbable as Norman's question was explicitly about the whole settlement — £0.8bn cash up front and £0.45bn over five years — and in any case merely served to confirm that the deal was about what Vodafone was prepared to pay, not what the courts might have told it to.

When Homer tried applying more of the buttery stuff— ""we do not settle for a lesser amount than we believe we would reasonably expect if we litigated"" — Hodge, not for the first time, lost patience. ""You don't take legal advice and then you tell me to believe that you think you will lose the point in litigation. It is an incredible position."" Indeed it is — as the Eye has been pointing out for two years.

PS: Unless he is called back very soon, the meeting was Hartnett's swansong. Asked about his future plans he mentioned ""advising the governments of developing countries"". Lucky them.

Slow news day at the Telegraph?

The reason that Brown sold 60% of our gold was because the price of gold had been in decline for almost 50 years and our reserves were losing value.  The money was reinvested (not spent), so although the price of Gold has gone up since, potentially our investments have too - nobody seems willing to say whether or not they have.  

Plus we could never know that gold was going to go back up - the gold standard had been broken and it was a metal that at the time had no great use in industry.

true,lifeless2011,uk,Bristol/Croydon,"While some particular things about the Olympics are a bit.. wtf worthy. We have got to remember that for things like the Olympics, no way were we going to be able to improve our transport enough to withstand the 2-4 weeks of people rushing to different parts of London, they would need to at least double the capacity of all networks to even get close to handling the amount of people. Plus if they did somehow do this, people would be complaining afterwards saying ""They wasted money on transport when we don't need it any more"" blablabla. There's no happy medium when it comes to the UK it seems, its either too much or not enough. 

Olympic lanes are ""HOW DARE THEY CLOSE THE ROADS"" even though many of them are only going to be closed for particular events, we've had many cases of roads being closed off in London due to sporting events before, aka The Marathon which happens every year. While for some places it will obviously be a bit longer than a day or two, I think they are necessary otherwise the Olympics WOULD be an entire disaster.

Cost of the games is round about £11 billion (not of all it was taxpayers money). Yeah, this is quite a lot of money. But did you hear the amount of money that the UK government managed to claw back from savings in the last year? £11 billion. Yes, they actually managed to gain something near the £11 billion mark in just a year, mainly because they saved 6.7 billion more than they were expecting. See - http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2170092/Government-cuts-savings-6-7billion-underspend.html?ito=feeds-newsxml. 

There's no denying that this has meant a massive hit to services, life threatening in some cases, but we are in bad economic times... while the banks should be suffering from what they have done to not only the UK, Europe but the entire world. We know they will not do anything about it because its the one thing that more or less somehow keeps the British economy afloat..

The point of the fact is that it was going to cost stupid amounts of money, we all knew that. It was going to and will have bad things that will happen, transport WILL be severely pushed to its absolute limit and beyond, something before the Olympics was going to start WAS going to happen. These kind of things happen at  more or less every Olympic event.. unfortuantly for us its going to actually effect us, rather than some people in another country that no-one cares about because such is life. 

While the Olympics have been heavily corporated, its nice to think about the effect its meant to have on the world, a time of peace (and at the moment that really is needed) between some nations and perhaps even different areas in nations. As hard as it is I try to look past all through the crap that has happened, and will happen in the future and try to stay concentrated on what its actually about.. If we go in with a bad attitude about the games.. its not going to reflect on us very well is it?

[Source](http://www.dailyfinance.com/2011/09/13/six-reasons-businesses-cant-live-without-gold/)

&gt; A mobile device like a smartphone or tablet PC contains about 0.0002 ounces of gold. At $1,800 an ounce for gold, that's only 36¢ worth of gold in a typical device. Of course, with 1 billion phones manufactured each year, demand for gold from that industry alone adds up to 91 metric tons of gold -- $360 million worth. More will be accounted for by the 400 million desktops and laptops, and the more than 250 million TVs that will be manufactured in 2011 alone.

Of course the use of gold in electronics may not have changed, the volume of electronics has.  The gold standard was removed in the 70s and [the price of gold dropped from a high in 1981 to 2000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gold_Spot_Price_per_Gram_from_Jan_1971_to_Jan_2012.svg).",0,1342008616,null,0,false,0,c5cfn34,t3_wdnqv,t1_c5cfn34,t1_c5cfijk,null,1429348963,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Second time I saw it, it kinda sunk in that the big blue thing at the front was from Samsung (it hasn't registered the first time). I hadn't even realised they WERE a sponsor. I'm not even sure what was playing on the side of it, because it trundled through too fast to see much of anything on the big screen. As for Coca Cola - well, it just IS. I mean, that's all they are, so what more can they say? So they were basically just a bunch of people making a lot of noise. Incomprehensible noises - they could've been saying 'buy coke', 'have fun' or ANYTHING for all I know. Besides, we were't waiting for them, so they just drifted by without my consequence.

The only sponsor I did really acknowdlge was Coca Cola, because they had a couple of Minis with trailers running quite far ahead of the relay. The sponsor vehicles do actually keep quite a distance anyway, so it's not like they're all over the procession itself.

These skills will not be in demand under Rodgers. In the future, Liverpool will looking ever more at recovering the ball in the opponents' half and immediately focusing on retention rather than launching a counter-attack. A Rodgers team would only play to these strengths of Carroll's a couple of times a game.

However, we've seen in flashes (mostly from training sessions) that Andy has a lot more about him than this. Rodgers will surely want to have a good look at him in training before making any kind of decision. We know he can play a pass, but can Andy get his first touch and shielding of the ball to where it would need to be to play for Rodgers? The other half of what Rodgers is looking at is bravery: always wanting the ball; always being willing to make a mistake and have the crowd on your back; always doing the right thing rather than the easy thing. I am certain that Andy Carroll has this mental strength.

If it doesn't work out for Carroll at Liverpool, I have no doubt that a season on loan at a team playing more direct football and organising themselves around a target man will turn him back into a £20m asset.",0,1342011201,null,0,false,0,c5cfz23,t3_wd3xa,t1_c5cfz23,t3_wd3xa,null,1429349121,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Ray Wilkins is in the building. My word!

https://p.twimg.com/AxehzS2CEAAA7Q8.jpg

GCS QC: Probably finish tomorrow. Magistrate says if so, a verdict may be given by Friday afternoon, but he could also give a verdict on Saturday morning

14:10 Next up on the stand is the driver of the Chelsea coach (CD)

CD: Apparently when the coach left, police told him to remove all CHelsea signs and turn TVs off. Sounds like how we have to travel to/from grounds in Italy!

Apparently the CPS tried to bring in 'bad character' witnesses, the magistrate dismissed this. Waiting on Butch to step up and wax lyrical about 'fine young man' JT

RW: Butch is talking about how he's known Terry since JT was 16, multiracial squad and relationship with JT is only friendship, no business dealings. Saying how JT is always calm, defuses conflicts and is a rock. Wilkins wraps up with a joke and he and JT smile at each other

Regarding the coach driver, in case you're wondering why he testified. Well he confirmed the team left at a certain time, 18:49, which is when Anton is saying he and JT were discussing it in the dressing room. This backs up JT and AC's version of events. They say the discussion happened 15-25 mins after final whistle, AF says 45 which the coach driver has testified is impossible

14:25 Wilkins leaves the stand and next up is Bruce Buck, who has been here all day yesterday and today

Butch and Buck hug each other as they switch positions. Most of you won't know this but a lot of fans thought the reason for Wilkin's departure was that he had an affair with Bruce Buck's wife. Obviously this is definitely not true

Buck vouched for JT's personality, character and temperament. He also said QPR fans were such cunts his wife left in tears due to verbal abuse. Chin up Mrs B, you're married to Larry David after all. Buck leaves the stand

14:30 A statement of character to be read out from Salomon Kalou. Nice of him to do, good lad

Another statement of character, this time by Petr Cech

More statements, all signed personally by Boswinga, Meireles, Lampard, Mata, Romeu, Turnbull, Sturridge, Ferreira, Lukaku, Hilario, Torres, Essien, Ivanovic, Ramires and Luiz

14:40 Statement from a Pakistani businessman who runs a car rental service. Says he is shocked and amazed at allegations and cannot believe them at all. This guy's a Liverpool fan?! Lynch him! I gest, but just another (neutral?) who thinks this is ridiculous

Ryan Bertrand : ""I'm a black, English footballer and I'm supporting JT because I know he's not a racist"". Again, he's not on trial for racism, merely using a racist remark but we hear ya Berty

GCS QC: Attempting to bring in a professor who will discredit lip reading evidence in court

Judge says he will not make lip reading evidence inadmissible though admits there is a 'weighting' of evidence. Basically saying how tenuous the interpretations of the video were, with disagreements between the lip readers

AVB news: He says uniting the squad against him was part of his grand strategy to win the CL, and it worked. What a twonk if those quotes are accurate. Also, says he's ready to sell Modric for the right price

That their homes provided by the army are horribly substandard - http://www.housingexcellence.co.uk/news/army-housing-national-scandal-say-lib-dems-111842

The lack of support for people with PTSD, the limited payouts for people who get injured at war, the fact that we torture people and the scars that will leave on any human, the lack of support for people with eye injuries specifically. I'm sure I could go on and I more than appreciate this does not happen to everyone, especially those at the top, but overall if I saw that kind of information coming out of any other organisation I would be pretty horrified. I don't support warfare and question many soldiers motives but even I believe that they could be treated a hell of a lot better. 

Just because some people cope well doesn't mean that everyone does. As ever, it is those with the least skills and worst support networks who suffer most.  ",0,1342012732,null,0,false,0,c5cg7d9,t3_wbcps,t1_c5cg7d9,t1_c5cfran,null,1429349229,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

We also supposedly made about [£27m in transfer profit](http://www.transferleague.co.uk/premiership-transfers/tottenham-hotspur-transfers.html) last season by selling O'Hara, Keane, Hutton, Crouch, Palacios and Pav, and only buying Parker, Coulibaly, and Falque.

I think that's where the £50m transfer budget that was talked about came from. And then there's the chance (read: hope) that we can sell Jenas, Bentley, Pienaar and Gomes for something (Should see at least £15m for all 4, I would think).

Vertonghen, Gylfi, and Lloris (at £16m) is £33m. Add in Ade for £5 and we could still have upwards of £25 for another striker. And if we can get some of the fringe players off the wage bill, that might free up additional money for transfer spending.

I don't see us buying another top midfield (Dzagoev, Moutinho, etc.) unless we sell Modric, and that should add another £30-35m to the coffers.

I find that argument intriguing as I simply cannot relate to it on a personal level. I did not feel the slightest change in my inclination to visit Beijing, Athens or Sydney after watching each of their Olympic games, nor have I felt tempted to visit South Africa, Japan or South Korea after they hosted the football World Cup. 

Is there any evidence people actually do this, that is, get the urge to visit a city just because an event hosted there has been on TV for a few weeks? I can just about believe this might be true for more obscure destinations (maybe someone will consider visiting Armenia after Eurovision), but I'm sure the effect on huge obvious places like London is negligible.

Most councils provide a freedom pass specifically for those who need it most as it is a lifeline for them to get around and do they're errands, or in this case go to the hospital. 

Let's use an example: My Grandmother isn't disabled technically, however she is prescribed powerful painkillers to relieve the pain caused by arthritis in her back and knees. If my Grandmother wasn't allowed on with her trolley she uses for stability for her multiple trips a month to the hospital then it wouldn't be possible for her to receive treatment to the haphazard schedule of the NHS. You think the guy has it easy with his two sticks? The medication my grandmother is prescribed for her back is the same that was prescribed to me when my face was bitten and my nose broken, and she has to take it every day.

Personally I'm in favour of fuel duty currently paid at the pump going towards a default 3rd party insurance for all drivers.  You pay for fuel, you show your license, and every car on the road is by default insured 3rd party.  If you want extra insurance you purchase it yourself either separately or tag it onto your home or life insurance.

What I would be worried about is if we say insurance companies can't discriminate between drivers.  Broaden the pool by all means to offset the costs of the riskier drivers but if someone is in the habit of speeding or lives in a risky area, doesn't garage their car, then not allowing for discrimination will only serve to raise the costs further for everyone instead of bringing them down.  Offsetting risk is an important aspect of insurance; but if everybody has to be treated the same the safest, most conscientious, most able, might well end up being punished.  Fuel duty towards a universal third party system seems to me a fair compromise.  It would also make it more difficult for unlicensed drivers to take to the road.

I'd even think better of him.  I've always thought stupidity was out of character for him, even if I don't agree with his political outlook.  

If Gordon Brown offset a flowering global financial crisis which would hit the UK with its strong finance sector the hardest, but couldn't openly speak on it other than to weaken confidence and to render the whole exercise pointless, then he deserves positive recognition for that in itself at least.  He'd have willingly fallen on a political sword at great cost to himself for the welfare of the UK as a whole - those are serious kudos points.  It's a standard to which we hope all politicians would aspire to.

The article argues, if this is the case, then his failing was to not learn from the experience and to put measures in place to prevent it happening again, which New Labour didn't do.

true,eternalkerri,dalek,Dalek,"I'm afraid you aren't understanding, so I will break it down as simply as possible:

Automobiles aren't meant to kill.  Toasters are not meant to kill.  Guns are meant to kill.  When cars and toasters kill, it is an accident.  When guns kill it is their purpose.  Overwhelmingly guns kill because that is the users intent.  When a car kills, it is overwhelmingly *not* the intent.

When you remove guns from the equation, you stand a far greater chance of not being killed.

By your argument, I should be allowed to carry about a vial of anthrax.  I'm not opening it around anyone, I'm just holding this vial of highly contagious and dangerous disease, it won't hurt anyone unless I open it.  However, because I can open it and spread it, I can kill people with relative ease, lots of them...horribly.  But it's only an object.

&gt;A gun is no more dangerous than a table saw. 

Really?  I would have to cut someones head off with a table saw to kill them outright meaning I would have to force a resisting person's head down onto the table, manage to turn the thing on without you getting away, and then hold you there for a few seconds while it saws.  A gun?  Pull, point, shoot.  Sounds like a gun is far easier to cause damage with a gun.

&gt;If you were consistent, you would be calling for the destruction if ALL guns especially those on the hands of law enforcement, the government and military.

Why especially law enforcement and military?  It's not inconsistant at all as the government legally...for most of Western history mind you, has what is called [""a monopoly on violence""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_on_violence), because they are using violence in the greater collective interest in the enforcement of safety and laws.  Yes, I know that Webers argument also says that it does not hold a monopoly on self-defense, but arguably, based upon statistics comparatively around the world, you can defend yourself quite successfully *without* a gun.  I have also shown that guns are not a deterrent to violence....I mean c'mon, robbing a gun store?

&gt;Bu your logic, you should also be opposed to all weapons of war since they are designed to kill.

What leap of logic does that come from?  We have been talking about civilian firearm ownership.

I can also guarantee that they wouldn't be a more careful and considerate driver, especially on a motorway and in the presence of lorries and the like.

When weapons of war kill it is their purpose. Overwhelmingly weapons of war kill because that is the users intent.  When you remove bombs, tanks, and machine guns from the equation, you stand a far greater chance of NO ONE being killed.  

If I have no need to defend myself, then the government has no need to defend me, logically.  Law enforcement is not tasked with preventing crime, but charging those after the fact. Society makes no provisions to guarantee my safety and in fact, often works contrary to that goal by allowing dangerous criminals to roam free. If no one had guns, the government included, then there would be no risk of criminals getting one. If you believe I can defend myself successfully without a gun, then surely highly organized governments can do the same thing. Further, if you believe that people who act in a prudent manner cannot keep guns safe, then those same people will not be able to do so just because they work for the government. Besides, why do we need nuclear weapons then when soldier could just use a pointy stick?

If individuals have no need for tools to kill people, then neither do governments. If no one in the private sector had guns, then the government would have no need to defend us using guns.

As an example: However, a 16 year old can buy a pistol without a background check or parental consent in Vermont, as long as be buys it used - in theory. However, in reality a person selling a minor a firearm would find themselves running afoul of multiple other laws that could be construe the action as child endangerment. 

This odd dichotomy comes from the fact that originally firearm laws were state level, then a law (it may have been the 1986 FOPA, or one of two predating it, the 1934 NFA or the one between I can't remember the name of) was passed on the federal level regulating the distribution and sale, not ownership and transfer. 

The 1934 NFA and 1986 FOPA both have relevant clauses pertaining to fully automatic weapons, the former creating a federal registry for them and the latter closing said registry to new entrants. This, despite the fact that firearms registered on the federal registry have been used in a hand full of crimes in the intervening 50 years and with an extremely low death count by comparison to regular old psychotic asshole mass murders. 

To put it in perspective, the LA shootings were with non-NFA registered guns (despite the fact they were manually converted to full auto) and columbine was with a sawed off shotgun (also an NFA classifiable gun, but not registered). 

Bottom line_______: criminals don't follow laws registering their firearms, who'd've thunk it?

true,eternalkerri,dalek,Dalek,"&gt;Simply putting their arm on the blade will likely result in death unless they receive immediate medical attention.

Mmm, no.  Not really.  With as many trips to the ER for stitches I can safely say that 4 hours waits while holding rags over rather nasty cuts means that it's probably not fatal to get cut.

&gt;When weapons of war kill it is their purpose...

Not sure where you are going with that.

&gt;If I have no need to defend myself, then the government has no need to defend me, logically.

No, you do need to defend yourself, and the government has an obligation to defend you.  You do not need to defend yourself with a gun, nor generally the government.  How you came to that conclusion, I'm not sure.

&gt;Society makes no provisions to guarantee my safety and in fact, often works contrary to that goal by allowing dangerous criminals to roam free.

With the United states imprisoning 80 more prisoners per 100,000 people than the next closest country, I don't think that the idea of roving hordes of criminals is that grave a worry.  

&gt;If you believe I can defend myself successfully without a gun, then surely highly organized governments can do the same thing.

Yes, its called ""most of the world.""  However they do have their police trained in firearms in case of emergencies.

&gt;Further, if you believe that people who act in a prudent manner cannot keep guns safe, then those same people will not be able to do so just because they work for the government.

Not necessarily.  Police officers and soldiers receive mandatory, regular training in firearm safety.  Any putz can walk into a WalMart and walk out with a shotgun.

&gt;If individuals have no need for tools to kill people, then neither do governments.

That simply not correct.  Outside forces in a society can act upon the government with force, and the government should be equipped to deal with it.  The general population has no need to be armed if they have an army and police force.

This whole line of thought of yours is starting to get a little silly and overtly black and white.  You also make assumptions about my line of thinking that are incredibly off base and frankly...illogical and not supported by my repeated rebuttals.  You aren't actually listening to me.

true,TheLushCompanion,mcgann,McGann,"Rose sends messages inadvertently via the psychic paper in her first season, and uses it successfully in the second. Jack uses it all the time. Torchwood operatives are trained to recognize it, as are the soldiers in AGMGTW. Psychic paper is not evidence of higher mental faculties. I think River shows that she does NOT have a complex understanding of the web of time, as the entire episode TWORS is predicated upon her being willing to sacrifice all of reality for the Doctor. River has far less respect for, and understanding of fixed points in time and the damage they can do than Donna in Fires of Pompeii, or Rose after the events of Father's Day. She's a terrible example of someone with temporal senses. I do agree that she's completely irrational though. And flying the TARDIS means nothing. Tegan and Adric both flew the TARDIS before. Hell, Tegan did it with no lessons. Not very well, but flew it nonetheless. The TARDIS was the one responsible for the mental bond that allowed River to learn to fly it. That contact was not initiated nor understood by River Song. Even Reinette showed more mental abilities than River has. After the Doctor initiated a telepathic bond with Reinette, she surprised him by being able to see into his mind while he was looking into hers. We've seen nothing of the sort from River. Everything she does is done with the aid of props: vortex manipulator, hallucinogenic lipstick, psychic paper. We don't see River doing anything that a normal human being can't do with access to the same props and training in their proper use. Finally on the DNA, Time Lords have three strands of DNA, not two. We do see that River's DNA has mutated, and changed, but we do not see nor are we told that she's biologically equivalent to a Time Lord. Does she have a respiratory bypass system?

true,yourfriendkyle,num19,,"I think one of the things that is being severely looked over as a benefit for having Jan join our team is his usefulness as a utility player. Not only as a left-back, which he has before stated he does not prefer, but as a technical anchoring midfielder should Sandro/Parker not be fit at the time to fill that spot. He is technical and physical enough to fulfill that role, with Caulker or Dawson filling in his pairing with Kaboul. In fact, if necessary against far better/technically gifted teams, in which case a more defensive mindset is needed, he could be fielded along a creater and a box-to-box midfielder in the 3 man midfield to shore up against teams who will hold the majority of possession (thinking about our future in Europe).

true,badwornthing,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;With this in mind why do you think public elections for such people is ever going to be a good idea? Wouldn't it be better for the top universities of the country to nominate and elect Lords from their faculties?

It would be a good idea for universities to nominate candidates, sure, but for them to be the only ones with the ability to vote on them? The opinions of university staff are the only ones that matter? There are plenty of extremely intelligent people who have no connection to universities: doctors, judges, engineers, business leaders, etc. For that matter, academic intelligence is not the only value important in Lords, ethics and morality is equally important. While you may not be an expert in every field, you don't have to be to be able to look at someone's history, qualifications and endorsements and make a judgement on their suitability. Besides, it's not like university staff are going to be experts on everything outside their area of expertise, so why should only they have a say? 

&gt;So yes, I do believe most people to be too stupid to be trusted to vote. The two party system, the failed AV referendum and popularity of reality TV leaves me with completely no faith in the average intelligence of your average voter.

Honestly I think you underestimate the average voter's intelligence, and your examples prove nothing. The AV referendum not going the way you'd have liked is no sign of stupidity, it's just a sign that people disagree with you. Personally I think it failed because they pushed for AV rather than PR, and AV is only a marginally better system than FPTP, not really worth the effort of changing to (sadly the conservatives are now claiming the failed referendum as proof that people don't want political reform, rather than just people don't want AV). Reality TV is a source of hatred for most of the sort of people who would actually bother to vote for Lords, perhaps an occasional guilty pleasure at worst. I know people with PhDs who still enjoy the occasional episode of Take Me Out, entertainment choices don't necessarily correlate with intelligence. 

Almost half of young people are getting degrees now, IQ tests constantly have to be adjusted as average intelligence is constantly increasing. The average voter (which is quite different to the average person, as the stupidest people are much less likely to bother voting) is certainly intelligent enough to know exactly what they're voting for and why. Don't make the assumption that anyone who disagrees with you on any issue is stupid, other people are considering issues just as thoroughly as you, they just assign different values to logic, morality and belief than you do. The sort of intellectual elitism that says only university staff should be able to vote is only going to reenforce the class divisions that the House of Lords currently represents.",0,1342027009,null,0,false,0,c5cjgr9,t3_wc0aj,t1_c5cjgr9,t1_c5cbx8p,null,1429350769,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,joooonyer,null,null,"I'd wager, Tottenham have the atmosphere they have because there is less expected of them. (Let me finish) 

They haven't spent the bankroll on top class players so their squad isn't as strong as ours so if they finish top 4 in the league it's great and something to celebrate. If Chelsea don't finish top 4 it's a shame and to an extent almost embarrassing. 

But one thing I've noticed about the talent at Chelsea is they're constantly smiling, laughing and joking (on and off the field). You might even say they're ""carefree"". 

Our transfers like Hazard, Marin and Mata (As well as many others) seem to choose Chelsea because of a direct recommendation from a current friend or team mate who played for Chelsea and happen to have great things to say at the club. (Hazard - J. Cole, Mata - Torres, Marin - Pizarro) 

AVB is very strict and anal about the smaller details, his coaching style just doesn't seem to jive with Chelsea, He's reported to have said he tried to get the team against him so they would be motivated to win the cup together, WTF? with his coaching we saw many players get fed up and angry (Anelka even transferred out mid-season to China.) This is when we were arguably at our worst. 

RDM on the other hand has proven he can coach the players with mutual respect. We expect a lot from our team-mates and even more from ourselves. He has confidence in the players' mental as well as physical abilities. 

My thoughts...glad AVB found a team he feels he can do well with, as long as he doesn't do better than us, but I doubt they will.

If all we had was health insurance and private hospitals a full time smoker with COPD and Cancer would have to pay more for their insurance than a healthy teenager.  And in any case a smoker pays more in tax through tobacco duty, drinker alcohol duty - these could be compared to insurance premiums.

Car insurance (and home insurance, private health insurance, life insurance etc) all have different premium based on peoples situation.  That is because insurance is a probability game. People that do not exercise their insurance subsidise those who do. 

Insurance companies calculate the value of the cover (eg. £10,000 your Car + £100,000 other car + legal expenses £7,000) multiplied by the probability of incident (eg. 0.3%) + a margin for operating costs and profit (0.05%) = £409.50.

true,Thinks_Like_A_Man,troughton,Troughton,"If government employees can be trained to use guns safely, then why can't the public? If cops with a lower IQ can be trained to use a gun, why can't Joe Q. Public? If you are trained by the government and then leave their employ, do you somehow lose your ability to use a gun wisely?  Should ex cops and ex military not be allowed to have guns even though they have been trained?

What ""emergencies"" would there be if there were no guns?  If no one owns one -- including the government -- then there is no need for them, correct?  Government should have no need to kill people, should they?  

By removing ALL guns, including those owned by the government, then there would be no concern about the having them fall into the wrong hands.  Surely even you will admit that if guns exist, criminals will have them. The only way to assure an unarmed society is to destroy ALL weapons, including those owned by the government.  

Let's start with complete global nuclear disarmament.  I am sure you are in favor of that because it meets your litmus test as a tool designed specifically to kill. This would be a far simpler starting point than destroying all the guns. Oh, and let's have strong sanctions against any country that still uses land mines for the same reason, don't you agree?  Many other countries don't see a need for land mines, so why don't we stop using them too?  That would seem to meet all your arguments, so are you in favor of the US banning the use of anti-personnel mines?

Based on your argument, you should have no problem starting with easier projects like these and then working our way down to hand guns.  In fact, I would be all for this and even support your position if you actually applied it to everyone using any weapon specifically designed to kill people, including those in control of the state.

**Would you support complete and total global disarmament?**

Further, your claim that the government will defend me kind of ignores little contradictions like Fast and Furious with these same ""defenders"" arming violent drug cartels. This situation actually creates greater danger for people like me who live near the border.  Or should I just ignore that thousands of illegals stream across the border and are armed thanks to the people you tell me are going to protect me?  The government is going to prevent that from happening right?  Like starting with not arming them and then securing our border?  

They have law enforcement and the military protecting me from foreign invaders coming illegally from Mexico, right and that's why my city has the second highest property crime rates in the nation. . . because the government is protecting us.

Please explain to me how that is working right now.  Tell me how arming violent drug cartel members is protecting me and keeping my kids safe.  I'd love to hear it.

But your naive point of view seems to ignore a few FACTS:

1.  The government routinely arms violent groups.

2.  The government does not and cannot protect citizens from violent crimes or property theft (yeah, I'm in favor of the Castle Law).

3.  You claim that if we give up our guns, the government will protect us from armed criminals, including foreigners.  If they can't do it now, why would a law-abiding citizen giving up their gun improve this situation when our government is arming criminals?  Is somehow removing guns from private citizens means that Mexican drug cartels are going to stop using guns? 

4.  How are we going to prevent the government from arming criminals?  What assurances do we have that this will not happen again?  Even IF (big IF) we could punish those responsible, it will not remove the guns from their hands.",0,1342028417,null,0,false,0,c5cjuub,t3_wc5m3,t1_c5cjuub,t1_c5cj4r4,null,1429351019,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The conspiracy theorist in me thinks this may be connected to security firms being American owned. 

If it were up to me I'd let the Americans stay at home if they're that paranoid about Europe. 

Note, we coped with Euro 96 being held on English soil without this fuss and that was back when there was a lot of football hooliganism.

That a letter in felt-tip in his own hand, exactly how he wrote to his own colleagues, but still takes the time out of his busy schedule to write a personal note, is as personal and as heartfelt as it gets.

Seriously.

To what gain?  Or is it all just stretching it a little?

Honesty in politics not only comes from showing the virtues of those you support; it has to lie in also fairly recognising others.

The message that comes from this is that Gordon Brown is practically blind; but that doesn't detract from him as a politician, his politics do that.  That he makes a serious misjudgment in not evaluating his presentation knowing his physical weaknesses, somewhat does detract from him as a politician, but it's not remotely the same thing as what you're accusing him off; deliberately going out of his way to extend the hurt of a mother of a fallen soldier.

I agree with you though. Chelsea and AVB were a poor match because AVB was a confrontational micro-manager (ha, get it, he's small). I have no doubts that he is a great tactical manager, and in the long term, he could be a fantastic Premier League manager for some lucky team. But he simply did not have the experience or the respect of the players to come in and dominate the squad. On the other hand, Terry/Lamps/Drogba/etc. did, and you saw who the squad ended up siding with.

At Chelsea, you have quality players, quality professionals, and high expectations. The situation does not lend itself well to having some young Rico Suave bust in the door and go all dictatorial on what has been a solid, tight-knit, highly motivated locker room for years now. The players  need tactical help and help with planning for matches, but they do not need to be treated like children or, even worse, disrespected by a young manager who has not accomplished as much as they have.

I hope AVB figures it out because I do like the guy. I think he has the potential, and hopefully he learned something from managing us.

true,Eddie_Hitler,cnty-uk,Scotsman in East Anglia,"To me, the reason the prices can get ridiculous is because car insurance is compulsory.  This has the knock-on effect of the insurance companies being able to get away with it because you'll have to cough up for *some* kind of insurance; unfortunately, this has another knock-on effect of some people simply not bothering and going undetected because the police are stretched paper thin thanks to Theresa May.  Don't get me wrong, I have no issues with people *having* to have car insurance because I think it's a very good thing.  In some places (notably parts of the US), car insurance is entirely optional which leads to lawsuits and frightening bills.

I'll be moving shortly for a new job and bought a car recently.  For my current (home) location, the insurance was ~£550 with one insurer - put in a postcode of a flat I'd looked at in my new town?  Premium goes up to £1200.  Do the same thing with another insurer, and the original quote was £440 and went up to just £600 with the same house move factored in.  Absurd, but this is because the town I'm moving to apparently has a small-time modding and ""car gathering"" scene which causes little to no trouble yet scares insurers shitless.

true,eternalkerri,dalek,Dalek,"I have absolutely no earthly idea how you came to this idea that I support global disarmament.

You have somehow convoluted the idea of a society not having the necessity of firearms with a government, which are wholly two different things.  Additionally, you attribute this idea to me, when I have stated repeatedly to the contrary.  

Finally, you make some wild assumptions that my viewpoint is naive, when I have stated several times to the contrary.

&gt;The government routinely arms violent groups.

That aren't in this country...

&gt;The government does not and cannot protect citizens from violent crimes or property theft (yeah, I'm in favor of the Castle Law).

And the ownership of firearms does not protect you from violent crimes or property theft, people are attacked and robbed *all the time*.

&gt;You claim that if we give up our guns, the government will protect us from armed criminals, including foreigners. 

Yes, they generally will, also those criminals will not be armed with firearms mostly, as evidenced by the whopping 57 gun related murders in England in 2010, statistically you would be more likely to be hit by lightening than shot.  Criminals would now be forced to use other means generally, of which the average citizen has multiple options to deal with as varied as tazers to not going into bad neighborhoods to home alarms.  As for as the foreigners argument...that's why we have a military and law enforcement agencies like the FBI.

&gt;Is somehow removing guns from private citizens means that Mexican drug cartels are going to stop using guns?

What the actual fuck?  You mean to tell me that by removing firearms from the general population, Mexican cartels are going to flood the streets of Phoenix firing wildly from suburbans?  I'm pretty sure what keeps those cartels in Juarez and not Phoenix, is the National Guard, Border Patrol, FBI, ATF, DEA, Arizona State Troopers, Phoenix PD, and the U.S. Military, not John Q. Public and his Glock pistol.

&gt;How are we going to prevent the government from arming criminals?

What absolutely paranoid scenario would cause that?  Fast and Furious?  [That's nowhere near the scandal people actually think it is](http://features.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2012/06/27/fast-and-furious-truth/?hpt=hp_t2), its more the result of schizophrenic gun laws.

&gt;What assurances do we have that this will not happen again?  

When did it ever happen?

I'm afraid that your overly hyped paranoid scenario's that are pulled from a ""Soldier of Fortune"" fantasy, eventually reinforce my original point that this is a gun obsessed, violence loving society.  Attitudes of ""My gun protects America from Mexican Drug Cartels"" is the type of attitude that leads to vigilante justice that resulted in a dead kid in Florida.

Your attitudes ultimately make my points of

1)  Americans have an obession about guns

2)  Americans are hyper aggressive

3)  Many gun owners probably shouldn't actually have them.

4)  Guns are weapons in their design, and are not tools like saws or cars.

5)  Guns serve no purpose for the overwhelmingly vast majority of Americans in the 21st Century where we have a solid and functional military and police force.

6)  The only purpose to owning a firearm in America is to defend against *other firearms* which would be far less common than if they were legal in the first place.

7)  The sacrosanctness of the 2nd Amendment is bizarre considering the incredible number of changes to the Constitution that have occurred over the years.

I'm afraid that your ""criminals, cartels, and cars"" arguments leave me baffled at the failures of logic and critical thought to the realities of the situation

Similarly, black people are statistically more likely to commit crimes, but that doesn't mean you can refuse to employ black people.

The point is you shouldn't judge someone based on what other people who share a characteristic with them have done.

true,multijoy,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"&gt;Insurance is a method of mitigating risk by paying a known cost to prevent an unknown cost. 

Yes and no. When someone buys *compulsory* car insurance, they aren't (for the most part) making a calculated decision to mitigate their risks but are simply doing that which they need to do to to be allowed to drive legally. There might be some calculation (can I take a punt on a massive excess to bring the cost down?), but people simply don't care about the level of 3rd party cover, which is the bit that costs insurance companies money.

&gt;Australia is a completely different environment to the UK with much lower population and traffic densities and as a result they may be able to cope with that method of insurance.

That's a moot point, though. If you were to set up a centrally run third party insurance system, you'd legislate to ensure that costs/payouts are set by the scheme and not as an outcome of tort cases. You'd also ensure that certain payouts that are costly (the credit hire of substitute vehicles) are either completely exempted or capped.

You know that the current insurance system isn't working when many, many people find that (in the short term) the costs of a series of FPNs for having no insurance is cheaper than buying insurance. It shouldn't cost a yoot a £1000/yr to insure some 10 year old piece of crap against third parties because it means that they just won't, and that's bad for whoever they hit.",0,1342032772,null,0,false,0,c5cl278,t3_wdwsr,t1_c5cl278,t1_c5che0a,null,1429351586,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Simply put, each year we wait is a year we fall farther off the pace of the money these oil and gas magnates and their superstars can come up with. Financial fair play won't help us, it will just slow them down a bit, since they've already aligned themselves for success with their pre-FFP spending.

If that's all it accomplished, it wouldn't really expand the brand here. After some thought, if Dempsey managed to get coverage on Sports Center or some other similar show in the states, it could drum up interest. Picking an EPL side to support as an American can be kind of an arbitrary thing, and that might be enough to win over what could grow to be dedicated fans/more revenue for future signings.

He'll need to keep his current form going. Yeah, he's old, but who knows, maybe the team could benefit from experience. He understands the pace and physicality of the EPL. If only he can drop the cowboy from Texas act, I'd like him even more. If we can get a good player for a good price with the added bonus of drumming up fans in an emerging market, I can't see a downside.

true,Thinks_Like_A_Man,troughton,Troughton,"You obviously miss the point about global disarmament.  If guns are evil because they are designed to kill -- and you believe that is a sound reason for getting rid of them, then ALL weapons that are designed solely to kill are evil. 

Correct?  

If a gun is bad because it is designed for no other purpose than to kill people, then a nuclear warhead is evil as well.  You should then support removing all weapons of war completely and totally from the world because they serve no purpose other than to kill people.  If removing guns makes the world safer, then removing nuclear warheads will make the world safer. 

If you believe that I, as an individual, will be safer not owning a gun, then the world must be safer without ANY weapons.  We would not have to arm our cops and not have to worry about anyone getting their hands on a gun.  There would be no theft of guns from cops and, by your logic, no need for cops to shoot people. If I can defend myself using a taser, then a cop should be able to defend me using a taser. 

Following this logic, removing ALL WEAPONS in the world would be prudent and beneficial.

You won't even say you support the US entering into a treaty to do away with anti-personnel mines, when these are completely unnecessary.  This is actually an argument for disarmament that I would support as mines invariable kill innocent people years after a war.

Second, you admit that our government arms criminals (regardless of the levels, we don't have to argue it because ANY level where the government arms criminals is bad).

If law-abiding citizens having guns is bad, then giving them to criminals surely must be worse -- regardless of the number.  Remember, these are the people you are assuring me are going to protect me from the groups they are arming.

**You want the government to remove guns from the hands of private and law-abiding citizens while they arm violent criminals and think these same people will protect us from those criminals?**  Explain to me how that works.  Don't tell me it isn't a big deal, or it's not as many guns as I think.  I would like you to defend the PHILOSOPHY where the people who are supposed to protect me from border violence on a daily basis, ARMS the same people committing that violence.

Again, anyone entering this country ILLEGALLY is by definition a criminal invader. The government cannot or will not stop them now, despite having the largest military force in the world. By what logic do you think that will happen in the future because we have been disarmed?  If the government is not protecting us from violence NOW, what assurance do I have they will do so in the future?  This will just magically happen?

So AGAIN, how would removing guns from the hands of private citizens suddenly make the government able to protect us from criminals coming from Mexico?  I am not talking just drug cartel members, but anyone entering this country illegally, who, by the nature of the act, is a criminal invader.

And please, address the land mine issue.  I'd like you to tell me you do or do not support the US military continued use of those. . . ",0,1342034580,null,0,false,0,c5clk46,t3_wc5m3,t1_c5clk46,t1_c5cknax,null,1429351820,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,eternalkerri,dalek,Dalek,"&gt;If a gun is bad because it is designed for no other purpose than to kill people, then a nuclear warhead is evil as well. You should then support removing all weapons of war completely and totally from the world because they serve no purpose other than to kill people. If removing guns makes the world safer, then removing nuclear warheads will make the world safer. 

[Just War Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_war_theory).

&gt;If you believe that I, as an individual, will be safer not owning a gun, then the world must be safer without ANY weapons.

Yes, that is logical, however is not realistic, not all places in the world are socially stable enough to support a system of law enforcement capable of enforcing that.  I mean, there is nothing in the world that can stop you from making a bow and arrow...

&gt;If I can defend myself using a taser, then a cop should be able to defend me using a taser. 

Yes.  That's why UK law enforcement for example doesn't carry firearms generally, but do have SWAT units, and all their officers receive training.

&gt;Following this logic, removing ALL WEAPONS in the world would be prudent and beneficial.

True, but not realistic globally.  It is realistic and has evidential proof to back it up, that restricting firearms reduces violent crime...just look at most of the developed world.

&gt;You won't even say you support the US entering into a treaty to do away with anti-personnel mines, when these are completely unnecessary.

Where the hell did that come from?  

&gt;Second, you admit that our government arms criminals (regardless of the levels, we don't have to argue it because ANY level where the government arms criminals is bad).

I most certainly did not.  I said they armed foreign groups.  The US government has never armed domestic criminal or terrorist groups, ever.  Where you got that conclusion from I have no earthly idea.  You are starting to say I said things I certainly did not.

&gt;You want the government to remove guns from the hands of private and law-abiding citizens while they arm violent criminals and think these same people will protect us from those criminals?

Seriously dude, what in the hell are you talking about?  When has that ever happened?  

&gt;Again, anyone entering this country ILLEGALLY is by definition a criminal invader. The government cannot or will not stop them now, despite having the largest military force in the world.

What?  So those Border Patrol agents, National Guard patrols don't exist?  They stop them pretty damn consistently.  

&gt;If the government is not protecting us from violence NOW, what assurance do I have they will do so in the future? This will just magically happen?

It's only as magical as this ""government is arming the criminals and aren't stopping people at the border"" scenario.

I'm sorry, but you are imagining some rather bizarre facts, citing wrong ones in other places, think I'm saying things I'm not and repeatedly have refuted.

You really are just to much.

&gt;True, but not realistic globally. It is realistic and has evidential proof to back it up, that restricting firearms reduces violent crime...just look at most of the developed world.

Yeah, like Norway.  No crazed individuals are going around killing 80 people, right? Oh. . . wait. . . They have some pretty strict gun laws.

&gt;I most certainly did not. I said they armed foreign groups. The US government has never armed domestic criminal or terrorist groups, ever. Where you got that conclusion from I have no earthly idea. You are starting to say I said things I certainly did not.

I didn't say ""domestic"" criminal groups. AGAIN, ANYONE ENTERING THIS COUNTRY ILLEGALLY IS A CRIMINAL.  From your link YOU provided, ""By 2009 the **Sinaloa drug cartel** had made Phoenix its gun supermarket and **recruited young Americans** as its designated shoppers or straw purchasers. [A CRIMINAL ACT]  **In a remote stretch of Peck Canyon, Ariz., Mexican bandits attacked an elite U.S. Border Patrol unit** and killed an agent named Brian Terry. The attackers fled, leaving behind two semiautomatic rifles. A trace of the guns' serial numbers revealed that the weapons had been purchased 11 months earlier at a Phoenix-area gun store by a Fast and Furious suspect.""  

&gt;""You want the government to remove guns from the hands of private and law-abiding citizens while they arm violent criminals and think these same people will protect us from those criminals?""

&gt;Seriously dude, what in the hell are you talking about? When has that ever happened? 

You should read the link you provided.  The government ARMED the criminals that shot a US Border Patrol agent.  Again, it's called FAST AND FURIOUS and it put weapons in the hands of Mexican drug cartel members while allowing people to illegally purchase guns in the US -- without stopping any of this.  These are the same authorities you are assuring me will protect me and keep me safe from these same criminals.

So, again, the question stands.  If the government is arming criminals, and those criminals are killing people, how is that protecting us?  Let's not debate the numbers, I am asking you philosophically to address this.  If the government isn't protecting us NOW, how will giving up our guns protect us from this in the future?



&gt;What? So those Border Patrol agents, National Guard patrols don't exist? They stop them pretty damn consistently. 

You're kidding, right?  This is from the FBI:

&gt;The U.S. border with Mexico extends nearly 2,000 miles. And it’s along this expansive stretch of territory that drug cartels and their street gang enforcers ply a dangerous and costly trade.

&gt;Drug trafficking. Human smuggling. Extortion. Murder. Corrupt public officials. **All these crimes represent a multi-billion dollar industry and they pose a threat not only to communities on both sides of the border, but to our national security as well.** [I guess they aren't doing as good of a job as you naively believe.]

&gt;Perkins: What we do have on the U.S. side of the border are kidnappings, corruption issues, and the illegal drug trade that goes through. The cash that's flowing south, the weapons that are flowing south, **and the drugs that are flowing north**.

&gt;Narrator: To combat the drug trafficking organizations and other criminal elements on the border, the FBI partners with Mexican law enforcement and many federal, state, and local agencies on task forces targeting drugs, violent crime and public corruption. The stakes are high **Just one corrupt border guard could potentially put the entire country at risk.**


You told me that the government will protect me from these people who routinely break into homes where I live, kidnap people and do home invasions. The FBI says it's a major problem.  So explain to me again how GIVING UP MY GUN IS GOING TO PROTECT ME FROM THESE PEOPLE?  **You keep evading that issue.  How is the government going to protect me from illegal Mexican drug runners and their crime when they aren't doing it now?**

Why not just address the question?  If I am not safe NOW, how will giving up my gun make me safer?

&gt;That the cartels used fronts to legally purchase firearms in the U.S. and then used them illegally? They are skirting the law to purchase weapons openly available, when otherwise they would have to purchase them from international arms dealers or steal them from the Mexican military.

Tell me again how the government is protecting me from these people?  You know, keeping them out of our country, keeping them from getting weapons illegally and keeping them from bringing drugs into the US?  They were aware of illegal gun purchases and did nothing about it.  Nothing.  You are now saying that the guns were the problem and not the law enforcement who didn't do their jobs.  

That's been your argument all along.  I don't need a gun because the government is going to protect me.  Now you are saying they knowingly allowed them to illegally purchase guns. 

By your argument, if we stop selling guns in the US, these criminals will just get them elsewhere.  So these drug smugglers coming into the US with guns purchased ""from international arms dealers"" or stolen ""from the Mexican military"" won't be killing people because. . . .guns from elsewhere don't kill people?  The government is doing such a bang up job of stopping them from entering the country?  What?

Vodafone and O2 are about equal really - I've been in the same place with a phone on O2 and the other on Vodafone and they both picked the signal up fine. However, the Vodafone HSPA signal did cut down to 2G/E several times whereas the O2 signal stayed constant.

The advantage of O2 is that when you go over your data limit on contract they throttle you until the new period -[ Vodafone charge you](http://www.vodafone.co.uk/personal/mobile-internet/on-your-phone/manage-your-costs/index.htm) for going over.

Customer service with O2 and Vodafone has generally both been quite good. They've both solved any problems I've had - it's quite hard to comment on this I guess.

Personally I'd choose O2 over Vodafone. For me anyway, the fact that they don't charge you for going over is a huge bonus (and if you need extra data it's easy to add). Plus the priority moments actually has some great deals now and again.

Well, it's kind of hard when Arizona has some of the most permissive gun laws in the country that allows straw buyers to exist.  Why do those laws exist?  Because your fellow gun enthusiasts feel the need to purchase 4 SKS rifles at at time is your right, so lawmakers don't restrict that right.  Are you understanding now?  The problem of the straw buyers and cartels exist *because of the lax firearms laws that people like you want*.

People like you are actually the reason the government can't protect you.  Because for some reason, you feel it is perfectly reasonable to purchase multiple military grade firearms at a time and be able to simply give them away in the parking lot of the store!  And you scream about how the government can't protect you?  It's because of the absolutely insane laws that govern the control of firearms.  The government can't protect you because you won't let them!

&gt;f the government can't stop these crimes now, and can't stop criminals from coming in the country, despite having the largest and most powerful military in the world (which protecting our borders is their primary duty), how are they going to protect us in the future?

A good place to start is not letting crackheads be able to walk into a gun store and purchase 10 AR-15 rifles with cash money, fill out a piece of paper that carries a slap on the wrist penalty if falsified and be able to just give them to whomever they want in the damned parking lot.

You'll have seen the adverts that specifically identify lady drivers.

You'll have seen the adverts that specifically identify more mature drivers.

They're both applying to a niche that eliminates the higher risk.

Fully comp-only companies do the same thing,  eliminating the higher risk category.  

Nobody wants to run the higher risk category  just as private health insurance companies don't want to specifically insure the old, the unhealthy or women of child baring age, or at all if legally possible, unless they come with extraordinary high premiums.  We accept that that in itself is not right for healthcare, choose not to discriminate on a number of counts, and provide a minimum standard of coverage; a bar that we just happen to set, rightfully so, very high in the UK.  

Access to healthcare and freedom of movement are fish in the same kettle.  If we build a society that realistically requires the ability for comparative long distance travel over a short period of time, and if we don't provide an alternative means, then it is wrong to exclude someone because of their age or financial means by squeezing the insurance pound.

We address the issue by saying the whole spreads the worst risk to provide a minimum. and then those that want extra can afford a lower premium depending on the level of risk, which they themselves can choose to minimise.

true,Thinks_Like_A_Man,troughton,Troughton,"So the government, even though they were aware of the illegal purchase, couldn't stop these people because. . . they are too incompetent to stop criminals from violating federal gun laws?  Gun laws which have ZERO to do with open carry or concealed carry. But don't worry, we should believe these same people are competent enough to protect us from criminals?  How does that follow again?

They can't stop illegal gun purchases when they have knowledge of them, they can't stop drug cartel members from entering the country illegally, they can't stop them from killing a border patrol agent, but they will be able to protect me and everyone else from being killed by them. . . because. . .we're unarmed?  Once we ban all guns in the private sector, these Mexican drug cartel members are not going to come across the border and commit more violence?

Is that your argument?

The government can't stop illegal aliens from entering the country because we won't let them? Seriously? And the government can't stop the criminals in southern Arizona because ""we won't let them""?  Tell me, how does me having a gun prevent a cop from arresting drug cartel members in the country illegally, or some crack head from breaking into my house?  No, really, I'd love to know.  This is so amusing.

How, exactly, are we stopping them from securing our border?  Are we not giving the military enough money?  Are we acting like we don't want them to stop this shit?  Is Arizona preventing them from doing their job?  Funny, I thought securing our border was a FEDERAL task that has nothing to do with gun laws in the states. Yes, it is law-abiding gun owners that are preventing the ATF, FBI, border patrol, Department of Public Safety, Homeland Security, CIA, NSA, *ad infinitum* from doing their jobs.  That's the ticket!  Because we demand the ability to defend ourselves, law enforcement can't stop criminals!

And let see, isn't it the GOVERNMENT who is supposed to be doing these background checks and making sure that criminals don't get guns?  Isn't that a federal law? So if they aren't enforcing this now, what makes you think they will enforce stricter gun laws, with exponentially more criminals trying to get weapons?  They can't even stop known Mexican drug cartel members from illegally purchasing guns in the US, yet you believe they are going to stop hundreds of thousands of criminals from doing this on the black market. . . how?

Dude, you have to be military, law enforcement and/or paid to post this shit.  You just admitted the government can't perform even routine background checks, can't stop criminals from getting guns when they are aware of the activity, can't stop criminals from killing border patrol agents, and yet, you're going to tell me that I should believe that they will be able to protect me if I just give up my guns?

Oh, geez.  I really hope some of the gun forums are following this.  Really.

[Even then, many IMAX cinemas use digital anyway.](http://www.slashfilm.com/qa-imax-theatre-real-imax-liemax/) It looks nicer than your standard cinema screen but it's definately not IMAX. They're just using the screen of an IMAX with a mostly usual digital projector. I've never watched anything at an IMAX before (except for one of those fake IMAX screens on holiday) but I don't like the look of it anyway. It's in such a way that you can't see the whole screen at once, you need to turn your head. Some say it's ""immersive"" but to me it's a stupid idea.

So yes, after somehow still going on about this, just go to the Odeon in Belfast. Best screens in Ireland as far as I know, definately in NI anyway. Nice and crisp Digital 8K screens

All this article does, it seems to me, is typical BBC reporting - giving a bare minimum of facts to make a story. And the BBC has demonstrated, over the last half decade, that it will report completely untrue allegations as fact when it suits its agenda (a headline stating that an aide of Boris Johnson was ""racist"" was later proved to be completely false but resulted in the aide losing his job anyway).

It always irks me the way the BBC say ""a man"" has committed an alleged act. What kind of man? Tall? Short? Tattooed? Suited up? Aggressive? Gang member? Family man? Youth? Old age pensioner?

So that you don't end up an unarmed victim of a violent criminal.  So that you always have the tool in order to use your right to lethal force in self defense.  If you do get attacked, you will at least have a chance to protect yourself, better than if you are unarmed.

It's not a deterrent, it's insurance.  It is mitigation against a low risk situation, and if that situation happens, you will be happy you have it.  If it never happens, carrying the gun didn't cost you much.

&gt;By that regard, by eliminating firearms altogether you significantly decrease your chances of being attacked, as the most likely situation to need that firearm would be in the event of a firearm being used against you, which if guns were illegal would be significantly lower. 

Not true, I need a firearm if a criminal attacks me with a knife in most cases.  I would not be willing to get into a fight with a criminal armed with a knife while I was disarmed.

&gt;The likelihood of you being the sole target of a knife wielding goon only exists on an individual basis and if you put yourself in direct harm.

It's safe to say that your amount of effort is equal to preheating an oven to 350 degrees, greasing and flouring a 9x13 inch pan, and then beating together in a large bowl: eggs, oil, white sugar and 2 teaspoons vanilla. Followed by mixing in flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Stirring in carrots. Folding pecans into the batter and then pouring it all into the aforementioned prepared pan and then baking it all in a preheated oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. After letting the cake cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, turning it out onto a wire rack and letting it cool completely.
    By the way, this is also an ice cream cake. For this, you'll have to select what type of ice cream you'd like (I went with vanilla).  Now you'll have to level and shape the ice cream to match your previously baked cake. Once you've done that, you'll have to place the layer of ice cream on top of a single lake of cake. Single layer you ask? Yeah, there's going to be another cake that will be going on it as well. Meaning all of the shit in the first paragraph, you'll be doing again. Guess what? You'll also need some sort of icing and if you want to put in a tad more effort, use fondant. Oh, you want blue fondant? Dye that shit with your own two hands (or using however many hands you have). After dying it, you'll have to stretch it to fit over your cake.
In summation, if you're going to bitch about something you chose to look at, quit clicking on links that lead you to cake.

There are probably 50 times as many Rooney, van Persie and Gerrard jerseys around than for those players.  Some day there might be an American player who is good enough to capture the imagination of America's non-soccer sports fans but that player isn't around now.  Clint Dempsey signing with Liverpool will do nothing to impact how many LFC games are shown in the US and will be a 30 second story on SportsCenter.  Yes, there might be some young fans who decide to root for us but not enough to really matter, especially if we don't back it up with a level of performance (as in, winning the league and CL) that keeps them engaged with the club.

In Asia there is something of a cult of personality around big stars.  People actually will follow teams based on one player and that team will get increased media coverage.  In America, we watch the best players, on the best teams, in the best leagues.  There are too many other sports options for fans to spend time and money on anything else.  If LFC wants to break into the American market the secret is to win lots of games.  That's it.

Ironic in that you think it's 'arguing with children' when you are so determined to pull the conversation into the sandpit.

Once again a conversation is struck mute by somebody trying to address an issue they wished somebody had said and which they have not.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"I love Huddlestone but there are some really big problems with this notion.

First and foremost, one of the biggest reasons Pirlo is still having success in spite of his lack of mobility and age is because Juventus and Italy are pretty much built around him. He's plays the deepest-lying role on the pitch to give him maximum space, and he's flanked by all-action players like De Rossi and Marchisio. These players are both tenacious, capable of winning the ball but also contributing to the attack. 

Huddlestone's lack of mobility can be overstated at times, but I still think he'd require this sort of protection. And I'm not sure we want to gear our team around accommodating him. He's good, but he's not Andrea Pirlo or Paul Scholes. It's also worth noting that even comparing him to a player who has never played in the Premier League is kind of silly. I'm not knocking the Italian league, but the pace and style of play are typically more purposeful and measured, with deep-lying players typically having more time on the ball. 

The one thing I can think of is more of a 4-2-3-1 like Madrid with Huddlestone in the Alonso role with Sandro winning the ball and pushing forward like Khedira. I think Sandro is definitely capable of developing into a box-to-box monster, but he's not really there just yet. 

Even that has its problems though. Huddlestone's defensive game will need to improve quite a bit to play in a deep-lying 2, IMO. 

I just don't think we have the box-to-box midfielder(s) that are required to facilitate a player like Huddlestone. Modric is actually probably the closest we have to that, as evidenced by their success as a pairing in 2009/2010--though we were also much more direct back then as well and mobility wasn't as big of an issue. 

I do think Hudd can play a part this season, but I'd be a bit worried if we were building our team around him. ",0,1342051319,null,0,false,0,c5cpvc1,t3_wegpf,t1_c5cpvc1,t3_wegpf,null,1429353853,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

I'm only advocating fuel duty pays for third party damage.  So if you're at fault the other person you hit isn't screwed.

Where people are saying that that doesn't allow insurance companies to mitigate risk I'm saying that people can have personal policies to protect their own cars for damage they cause, for fire, for theft (so if you have a nice car but live in a risky neighbourhood), but essentially whilst you're on the road by virtue of every car needing fuel every car is insured if it hits someone else.  

- An M.O.T. certificate (a test mechanics do to make sure the car is fit) makes sure the car itself is worthy to be on the road.

-  An active driving license to make the driver themselves are worthy to be on the road (by all means fine the driver for indiscretions - which they do, maybe make it more incremental if they have past discretions).

Rather than punishing statistical groups for being higher risk and the maximum punitive effect put more emphasis on the license and separate 3rd party insurance (which is the major cost which insurers try to avoid - a large part because of uninsured or unlicensed drivers), make paying for fuel a net provider to a national 3rd party car insurance, and where you have to pay for fuel, in the same manner you have to draw money out of your own bank account, you show a driving license.  If you forget your driving license there's already methods in place - same as if you forget your wallet or get distracted and forget to pay.

Ask for a license when someone pays for fuel.

-------------

Unlike America the problem here is that insuring a car when you're young, even if you're a stand-up kid with no issues, and driving a heap of junk, the insurance is a killer.  

As in huge.  

Of course it goes up the more points you have on your license and the more scrapes you've been in, but then again if Miami has a car crime problem it's not that relevant to Detroit, and vice versa.  In the UK one city's outer crime problem quickly becomes an hour's drive into any area.  It all adds to it.  Insurance companies are basically working progressively hard to eliminate the big risk - young drivers, especially males.  It's a bit like the US with the healthcare system, only people aren't as quick to rise because they don't especially want young drivers on the roads and there is some public transport for most.  It is becoming an issue though because more people are driving without insurance and that drives everyone's premiums up.",0,1342056970,null,0,1342057259,0,c5cr655,t3_wdwsr,t1_c5cr655,t1_c5cqgzj,null,1429354465,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

London has surrendered the traditional rights to the city to the demands of the Olympic 'family' and their corporate paymasters. What the IOC want, London will give.

Within this area, officially called an Advertising and Street Trade Restrictions venue restriction zone, no advertising for brands designated as competing with those of the official Olympic sponsors will be allowed. (Originally, as detailed here, only official sponsors were allowed to advertise, but leftover sites are now available). This will be supported by preventing spectators from wearing clothing prominently displaying competing brands, or from entering the exclusion zone with unofficial snack and beverage choices. Within the Zone, the world's biggest McDonald's will be the only branded food outlet, and Visa will be the only payment card accepted.

What if every time travel leads up to the creation of fixed points to allow the fabric of time and space to be help together to allow the fluid manipulation and rewriting of certain events. Basically the fixed points are stitches and what happens between each stitch is manipulable because it has to fixed points on each end to anchor it so to speak so it doesn't go out of control and destroy itself.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Okay, quick general overview. Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans/companions along with him to see alien worlds and history. We've had approximately 784 episodes (32 seasons) but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in nearly anywhere.

The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a you will like.

Don't like the eleventh Doctor? Try the tenth! Also, Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 (seasons 1-26) then relaunched in 2005 (seasons 27-32/series 1-6).

But by no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv). You should choose the 2005 point.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

And no matter what you do, watch all six series. And if you like them, there's always classic who... :D",0,1342062806,null,0,false,0,c5csjmo,t3_wf75b,t1_c5csjmo,t3_wf75b,null,1435701813,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

Jon's presence in Winterfell is a slap in the face to Catelyn. He is not her son. He was born from Ned's supposed infidelity.  You don't keep a bastard in the seat of your house. Jon Snow is a walking, talking stain on Ned's honor - and people throw it in their faces.

&gt;Look at how she captures Tyrion

Actively manipulated by Littlefinger.

&gt;and brings him to a mentally unstable woman who

Catelyn was unaware of her sister's mental state.

&gt;hates the Lannisters

The Starks aren't fond of the Lannisters either. Haven't been since they took forever to join Robert's Rebellion and *then* ordered the slaughter of Elia and her children. Where could she have taken him? There really aren't any fair trials in Westeros and most trials in the series end up being trials by combat.

There *especially* aren't any fair trials for someone like Tyrion. The Lannisters are not well-liked by anyone and Tyrion's deformity makes certain that he treated as a subhuman by most people in Westeros.

No really.

Tyrion isn't going to get a fair trial anywhere.

Here's a rundown of the seven major houses of the seven kingdoms, minus the exiled Targs:

1. **Stark**:
Hates the Lannisters after Robert's Rebellion. Presently suspect them of conspiring to murder their son and possibly the king.

2. **Tully**:
Hates the Lannisters after Robert's Rebellion. Presently suspect them of conspiring to murder their eldest daughter's son, another daughter's husband, and possibly the king.

3. **Arryn**:
Hates the Lannisters. Presently making claims that the Lannisters have conspired to murder their Lord and nephew.

4. **Baratheon**:
Tyrion isn't going to receive a fair trial in KL.

5. **Tyrell**:
Presently staying the fuck out of it. In the dog house since Robert's rebellion.

6. **Martell**:
Staying the fuck out of it.

&gt;She isn't worse than Cersei or Joffrey but she still isn't a character to admire.

She absolutely is.  Her only big mistake is falling for Littlefinger's game and capturing Tyrion. And almost everyone in the series is guilty of being manipulated by LF.

This is only partially true, but it's irrelevant anyways because we must use the 1776 definition of ""militia"" rather than the 2012 one. If the government could usurp the intent of laws by simply changing the definitions of key words we would all be seriously fucked. The intent of the second amendment was for the ""common man"" to have the right to bear arms... as that's who comprised the militia when the constitution was drafted. It's irrelevant that the definition of militia has gradually changed over the years.

If you disagree with my interpretation of the second amendment, please familiarize yourself with these quotes:

Quotes from a dead guy from 200 years ago can work in awful ways can't they?  If we are to take them at their word and treat them as infallable words of Gods, then we should consider all black people ignorant fools.

&gt;That the people have a Right to mass and to bear arms; that a well regulated militia composed of the Body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper natural and safe defense of a free state, that standing armies, in time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, and therefore ought to be avoided.

-George Mason.  Ooops, there goes that U.S. Army.

&gt;“Religion and good morals are the only solid foundation of public liberty and happiness.”

-Samuel Adams.   So according to him the only way to have liberty is to be religious?


So what other 200 year old sentiments should we embrace blindly and without question?

Is it possible... that he was in some respects correct? Blacks that lived in Africa in 1776 were *extremely* primitive. Reasoning abilities are learned, and if you're living in a primitive culture you will necessarily lack them. Thomas Jefferson was an opponent of slavery throughout his *entire* life.

&gt; That the people have a Right to mass and to bear arms; that a well regulated militia composed of the Body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper natural and safe defense of a free state, that standing armies, in time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, and therefore ought to be avoided.

I agree with this to an extent, actually. Our ""standing Army"" is absolutely ridiculous in size right now, and I do view it as largely unnecessary.

&gt; Religion and good morals are the only solid foundation of public liberty and happiness.

I agree with this. Religion has become synonymous with church and ""organized religion"" in modern society... but in 1776 the word had a far more vague definition. To be religious was simply to believe in *something*, some sort of principle... it didn't have to be supernatural. If you look in the dictionary today you will still see definitions that are more in line with the 1776 ""religion"" definition: ""a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith""

&gt; So what other 200 year old sentiments should we embrace blindly and without question?

true,eternalkerri,dalek,Dalek,"&gt;Is it possible... that he was in some respects correct? Blacks that lived in Africa in 1776 were extremely primitive. Reasoning abilities are learned, and if you're living in a primitive culture you will necessarily lack them.

Wow, that's only patently false, and kind of racist. and I left out the full quote, so think about this...

&gt;It would be unfair to follow them to Africafor this investigation. We will consider them here, on the same stage with the whites, and where2
the facts are not apocryphal on which a judgment is to be formed. It will be right to make great
allowances for the difference of condition, of education, of conversation, of the sphere in which
they move. Many millions of them have been brought to, and born in America. Most of them
indeed have been confined to tillage, to their own homes, and their own society: yet many have
been so situated, that they might have availed themselves of the conversation of their masters;
many have been brought up to the handicraft arts, and from that circumstance have always been
associated with the whites. Some have been liberally educated, and all have lived in countries
where the arts and sciences are cultivated to a considerable degree, and have had before their
eyes samples of the best works from abroad. The Indians, with no advantages of this kind, will
often carve figures on their pipes not destitute of design and merit. They will crayon out an
animal, a plant, or a country, so as to prove the existence of a germ in their minds which only
wants cultivation. They astonish you with strokes of the most sublime oratory; such as prove their
reason and sentiment strong, their imagination glowing and elevated. But never yet could I find
that a black had uttered a thought above the level of plain narration; never see even an
elementary trait of painting or sculpture. In music they are more generally gifted than the whites
with accurate ears for tune and time . . . . Whether they will be equal to the composition of a
more extensive run of melody, or of complicated harmony, is yet to be proved. Misery is often
the parent of the most affecting touches in poetry.

So yeah, he compared educated African Americans in the US and found them completely ignorant.  The man was by our standards racist, but for 200 years ago was perfectly fine.  See why 200 year old sentiments are precarious?

&gt; Religion has become synonymous with church and ""organized religion"" in modern society... but in 1776 the word had a far more vague definition. To be religious was simply to believe in something, some sort of principle... it didn't have to be supernatural.

Actually...no, he was talking about Religion as in an organized Church, as evidenced by this quote.

&gt;“The right to freedom being the gift of God Almighty, it is not in the power of man to alienate this gift and voluntarily become a slave... These may be best understood by reading and carefully studying the institutes of the great Law Giver and Head of the Christian Church, which are to be found clearly written and promulgated in the New Testament.”

Samuel Adams was also raised a strict Calvinist, a pretty fundamentalist belief system, not unlike that of the Puritans.

&gt;It's not a sentiment... but rather a founding principle of the country. The principle of self-defense doesn't become obsolete anymore than the principle of free speech or freedom of religion do.

So was the acceptance of slavery...  I mean they wrote rules for counting the population of slaves as 3/5 of a person for representation in Congress.  Founding Principles have been dispensed with.  I mean originally only male property owners in the U.S. could vote, only 21 and up could vote.  Senators were appointed by state legislatures.  Presidents only serve two terms.  Founding principles have been discarded and amended since the early years of the Republic I mean the 11th and 12th Amendments changed the ideas of judicial review and the electoral procedures written into the Constitution.  Both of those were voted upon by Founding Fathers sitting in Congress, State Legislatures, and the White House.",0,1342069167,null,0,false,0,c5cu038,t3_wc5m3,t1_c5cu038,t1_c5ctr98,null,1429355868,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

It just doesn't make sense to sell him prematurely, though. Sure, we may get a bit more right this second because of his contribution to the Euro campaign, but it won't come close to making up the difference. I kind of think regardless of whether or not it ends up working out he can only improve in the current climate at LFC unless everything we have on paper right now ends up going to fuck come August and the train derails.

He appears to have gained a bit of confidence over the last 6 months, and from the looks of it there's a real positive vibe going on at the club, which a player of his age and mentality needs to flourish. I just don't think he's been able to properly settle into this squad yet which isn't surprising given the high profile (and fee) of his transfer, the size of the club, and the recent ""instability"" of the club and its management.

With the question we believe is ""Doctor who?"" and his name is only known to the Doctor and River Song, I think a crazy story-line will develop which will involve sending River Song to her death at the library, and the end of Matt Smith as the eleventh.

We forget or don't trust why as Americans we decided to follow LFC in the first place. This club has a mystique, and a history, and a certain draw that is not lost, no matter what we as current fans feel about our current standings. It's still there. Others will see it.  But they have to be aware and exposed to it first. And when the fan-base grows stronger, the team will grow stronger.

I don't think Dempsey will be our savior, but he CAN move us forward. He can be a step in the right direction, and I'm talking about on the pitch, not from an esoteric gaining fans in other markets kind of way. He is not THE answer, but only a step in the right direction. And if the LFC savior isn't out there now, we could gain a step in the right direction with the added bonus of more exposure in the US. If we can get him for what he's worth on the pitch and everything else is just a bonus, we need to jump on it.

Except that there's next to zero chemistry between her and Smith, he doesn't seem terribly enthused about it, and we never actually see them *being* a couple.  

The short version is, I just don't buy it.  I don't mean to say that River's lying about it, just that the writers haven't ever fleshed out the relationship to the point I can buy into it or care about it in the least.  You can't just *say* two people are a couple; you actually have to show them being intimate in some way or another.  

Personally, I think the best thing they could do with River at this point is simply stop using her until the next Doctor changeover, cast someone who has more genuine chemistry with her (and is perhaps a bit closer to her in physical age), and actually work on building the romance rather than just trying to milk it for cheap tearjerker moments that get undone the next time they become inconvenient to the writers.",0,1342075187,null,0,false,0,c5cv4a0,t3_wf136,t1_c5cv4a0,t1_c5cud2m,null,1429356395,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

I'd say you could condense 5th season into 11th Hour, Beast Below, and then Amy's Choice. I think those are the best of that season showing the qualities you want, maybe add Vampire's of Venice for the sake of introducing Rory(Although I think that has some good gags too, starting with The Doctor being in the stag cake).

The Lodger is also a good standalone episode. Has good intrigue of what's going on upstairs as well as, at least I think, Craig and The Doctor have great chemistry with each other. If you were to pick one episode, I'd go with this. If you were going to marathon, I'd go with the aforementioned 11th Hour, Beast Below, and Amy's Choice. If you want to go all out, I'd suggest all of them.

Obviously I avoided seasons 1-4 as that's all everyone else seems to be talking about here, and I think the best episodes from season 6 are better the more you know the character of The Doctor, such as The Doctor's Wife.

When dairy farmers tried to set a price for their milk via the ""milk marketing board"", the bottling agencies took them to court and won. 

Mysteriously though,  when the tables were turned, and OFT fined Wiseman, Dairy Crest, Arla and the supermarkets for [colluding on the price](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7132108.stm) they paid to farmers, very little has changed.  The big supermarkets now pay fair prices, but the major diary firms like Arla and Dairy Crest still continue to screw the farmer.

The only way a diary farmer can survive, if they don't have a supermarket contract, is if the price of beef remains high enough to cover the loss making milk side.

Factory farming milk will allow you make a small profit, but at terrible cost to animal welfare, poor quality milk and beef.

The insane thing is, if the price of 1 pint of milk increased by 1p and that penny went straight to the farmer, this problem would go away.

Or the dairies could take less profit - they pay around 28p a litre for milk, and are proposing to drop that to around 24p, which is below the price they paid in the 90's. Since then feed costs have doubled, I'm sure you yourself have noticed some significant food price inflation in the past 15 years.",0,1342081603,null,0,1342081857,0,c5cw051,t3_wey1i,t1_c5cw051,t1_c5cvksa,null,1429356811,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Many of the other leading anti-slavery campaigned had similar conversions like John Newton, or devout in non-conformist denominations of Christianity like Joseph Wedgewood.

Goals are not necessarily a mark of how good a player is, Kevin Phillips won the Golden Boot (twice I think!) but no one has ever thought of him as anywhere near world class. 

In addition, his age is a worry for some fans. Unlike Bellamy and Maxi who were signed for free, many fans don't want the club to spend 10million on a player who might be able to only contribute for 2-3 years. Personally, I have no problems with his age, most American players seem to be able to play till a fairly old age (see: Mcbride, Brian) and Dempsey looks nothing if not fit. 

Lastly, there are worries that buying Dempsey might be a marketing move. Many football fans are disdainful towards such moves as they find that the idea cheapens their noble ideals for football.

Do I think the marketing angle of Dempsey is very promising... absolutely.

Their new Japanese player will do the same and grow Man U's market share further.

Dempsey's effect will be much different, since he's American and its America.

""This needs to be sorted out. Look at the price of milk on this article. Milk has only increased by 14p per pint in 21 years. What other product can you say that about? Many people complain about the reliance on subsidies by farmers in Britain but the reality is that without subsidies farmers just could not cope when they are not being paid a fair price for what they produce.
 
Too much power rests with the supermarkets and processors. Dairy farmers have little or no power to change what they are paid due to the capitally intense nature of the industry - the materials needed to run a farm are so expensive that striking by stopping production for a few days would result in a farm going out of business.
 
My family have been dairy farmers for generations. My brother, dad, cousin and uncle are currently working in the industry as my grandpa did before them and this type of story has been recurring as long as I can remember.

If you enjoyed the ending, then I can't say much.

It's just really not for me, and it always feels like it doesn't jive very well with the rest of Who history, which I absolutely adore.

I'd never fault you, or anyone, for enjoying it, though. At the end of the day, it's a tv show, and if it entertains people, then it did it's job. And, by it's very nature, Doctor Who is always changing. So while I'm not a fan of RTD, I really do love Moffat's writing now that he's taken over for seasons 5, 6, and 7(And however more he does). But I will say not to worry too much on the mechanics of how RTD wraps up a finale like that, as far as the Archangel Network, or future finales.

Yes you can.

My reply was pointing out that in fact moderate Christians have in fact help found and push forward those very rights they are alleged to have held back. I did so by providing factual information rather then the assumptions made in the said article. The article states that 'they forget the regressive influence their religion had on the movement' when in fact moderate Christians had a hugely progressive influence on the movement. 

The article states that Christians support a church that invests money in preventing homosexuals from getting married. Well this may have passed your attention but there are plenty of churchs that actively support gay marriage - such as the Quakers. By making sweeping generalisations the author undermines his own creditability. 

You say that every Christian I reference is a Christian progressive - so I guess they [were no true Christian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman). If in order for your point to work you have to paint the entire Methodist, Quaker, Non conformist Protestant and large sections of the Anglican Church as Progressive then the argument does not work. It is akin to me saying all Moderate Christians are Methodist, excluding all Catholics, Baptists, Anglicans and other denominations. As long as I exclude those then my argument is correct. 

I do not wilfully ignore the regressive Christians - the Establishment within the CofE were as resistant to ending the slave trade as they are to gay marriage/female Bishops. My problem with the article is that it labelled all Moderate Christians at fault. By doing so it included the progressive Christians with the regressive - ignoring the very people that helped propel the civil rights movement that are are lumped in as stopping.

3. I used to shoot from age 12, gave up when I was 19, did air rifle, .22 and full bore target shooting, so I don't have a problem with most of them. Most people tend not to talk about it in public-it's not the done thing to boast about shooting and owning rifles unless you're with people who have the same interests. Shooters are terrified of anything giving shooting a bad name (which could cause more laws making more difficult to shoot recreationally), including idiotic people showing off about it and so selection for clubs is very strict.

The farmers that are surviving have managed to breed better quality cows, so their milk yield per head has increased significantly. The new market in organic milk has helped others, and then there are the farmers with sufficient land to grow more profitable crops, the profits from the harvest, covering up the loss making dairy side.

It's not as if milk and beef production can be simply swapped around on any given farm. Milk cattle are typically sold into different markets, for different prices, than pure beef breeds. A milk farmer will necessarily have a certain amount of investment tied up in milking infrastructure, and needs to recoup the outlay (you can probably imagine the depreciation on this stuff). Plus he'll have contracts with buyers, Single Payment and agri-environment scheme contracts which tie him to particular production methods, and both cattle and beef farmers often have herds which took several (human) generations to build.

The big dairy units are indeed purely profit-driven businesses. Around here there are smaller family farms - still doing dairy - which are typically cash-poor but land-rich. The land is the only solid asset they have, and they've more sense than to sell bits of it; however it doesn't translate into ready cash.

true,lol_oopsie,null,null,"I know a bit about this. I don't want to diviluge personal info, but I have some general information:

Hours per week. A full time course is usually defined as 39 hours per week, but of course that is rarely enforced. It really depends on your supervisor and your subject more than anything. For science, you will need to work in a lab, but for other subject you will be doing research on the internet or in a library. Some supervisors will absolutely require you to work regular hours, and others don't give a shit when you are there or not. I know people who were yelled at if they arrived a minute after 8:30am or left a minute before 5:30pm, but that's rare. Of course if you are doing English or history, you will spend most time in the library and not with your supervisor, so you are more independent. IMO, most supervisors simply take the attitude of ""it's your PhD, so you decide how, when and where to work."" If you work by that principle, you'll find that some days and weeks are long, and you work through the night or on weekends. And other days and weeks can be very quiet.

At the end of the day, if you don't work hard, you'll probably fail, so that's worth bearing in mind. And people DO fail.

Academia is quite a nice ""cushy"" life once you've got past the PhD and post-doc stage. Lecturers have great job security for the most part, and really they can get by without working that hard. Plus they are studying a subject they love, and get long holidays. The money is ok (postdoc = £30k, junior lecturer = £36k, senior lecturer = £45k, professor can vary from 50-100k. Department heads etc get more on top. You can usually make more money in industry but more stress, and less security.

My advice for a potential PhD student is to make sure you LOVE your subject. If you don't love your subject, you are going to be VERY bored, VERY frustrated and absolutely HATE it. Doing a PhD requires tremendous dedication and quite a few people do drop out because they can't handle it. I can't stress this enough. You will likely be working on something constantly, focused on one tiny little aspect or angle of a greater topic. If you don't have the enthusiasm, you will drive yourself crazy. Also, if you are doing a science subject, at least 50% of your time will be spent fucking things up and failing. So hopefully you are ok at dealing with failure.

You also don't get paid very much (tax free stipend of £13-16k is typical). That's equivalent to a salary of £18-21k before tax, so your friends the same age will likely be making more than you. That can be quite annoying that you are 25-26 years old and still living like a student.

I'll just never really understand the think behind an armed human proving they can outwit an animal. Competitive shooting is less tragic, but again, not really for me to tell another what hobbies they should have. It's basically PlayStation but without the comfy armchair. 

4. I shot at school as part of an army cadet thing my school did. As a teenager, it was all very well. I can't really empathise with an adult wanting to shoot things, but if they did I'd imagine there are shooting clubs you can join that are reasonably affordable.

I realise this all sounds a bit supercilious, apologies for that, but they are my opinions. As an aside, there's a Police Inspector's blog (I believe he calls himself Inspector Gadget) who consistently rants about how British police should be routinely armed.

The disrespect the organisers have for the revellers creates a massive disconnect and lack of respect for the organisers. Consequently, year on year, Leeds Festival is regularly torched to the ground. Rather than relax some of their orwellian rules, the organisers decided to employ MORE security, giving a constant intimidating presence that says 'we want a fight'.

As can be so obviously predicted, this has led to more and more riots.

The Archangel network is brought up, sure, but just as a device that induces fear in people, nothing more.

Amy is simply responsible for bringing back The Doctor, because in order for his plan to work he had to be left on the other side of the cracks, and needed Amy to remember him back because she's special from growing up near the crack in her wall.

I generally disagree with people who want an American-style attitude to guns, or fantasists who want a proliferation of guns to use in ""self-defence"". This has **nothing whatsoever** to do with the sport of shooting.

3. There are so many types of shooter! The aristocrat with a dozen Purdeys letting rip at pheasants on his estate, all the way down to the young lad with his first .22 shooting tin cans and rabbits. I don't think it's possible to have a ""perception"" of shooters any more than one can have a ""perception"" of drivers - shooters come from all walks of life and use their firearms for a bazillion different reasons.

4. Is shooting that expensive? Compared to golf, or triathlon, or any other sport which requires equipment - no not really. You *can* spend thousands of pounds if you fancy, but otherwise you can just spend a few hundred and then a fiver's worth of ammo when you fancy shooting some things. If you have a patch of land and just want a pigeon for supper, you can get your licence and a ""tractor grade"" shotgun for under £200.

Shooting's no longer the elitist sport it used to be. If you're interested (and not a daydreamer with weird ideas about ""castle doctrine"" and armed militias) then get in touch with your local club and talk it through with them. Just remember that shooting has less tolerance for messing around.",0,1342096574,null,0,false,0,c5cxhch,t3_wfnc2,t1_c5cxhch,t3_wfnc2,null,1429357508,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

I'm not an expert but am aware of requirements for, e.g. shotguns, that there's basically a ban on pistols and that air rifles have a limit.

**2. Do you care about our firearms laws? Ie, if an election was soon would a parties firearms policy be something you would research and vote on.**

One of the few good things this current government have done was to not overreact to the Derrick Bird shootings. I wouldn't research a firearms policy because it probably wouldn't be in any of the parties's manifestos. There's general agreement that firearms laws work well and are sufficient; I would be wary if any party wanted to relax firearms laws and intrigued as to why a party would want to tighten them. There are exceptions; I would be against further militarisation of the police, for example.

**3. What's your Perception of shooters? Considering both game and competitive.**

I don't particularly have a perception of 'shooters'. I know people who love guns and are a bit weird about the whole thing but the majority of people I know who are shooters are fine people. I would guess it attracts a slightly greater proportion of nutjobs than are in the general population but I'm more worried about those nutjobs who aren't following the law and in clubs, etc. I see it a bit like archery.

**4. Do you think shooting sports is something difficult/expensive to get involved with ? Have you been interested but figured its too hard and not worth the effort? Or do you just not give a shit?**

You can tell how much power and connections that Alex has by the way River Song was written. She's a time lord that has used up her incarnations so she can NEVER be recast.

If you own your property as a married couple, when one dies, the survivor ends up owning 100% of it, and is at risk of having it appropriated by the council.

Before that the largest place they could put concerts on was Sheffield town hall.  They also did a lot of work on the high street, knocked old warehouses down, sandblasted all the things  and removed up to 8ft of soot from roofs.  The amazing impact those games had are still being felt 21 years later, imagine what Sheffield would be like now without those three venues and the city centre still coved in crud.

My perception or shooters is fairly indifferent. I enjoy shooting targets on a range, but I couldn't shoot an animal. However, my brother regularly kills animals for dinner, and I don't mind at all.

Getting involved is neither difficult or expensive. Granted, you need a gun, but that's a one off cost - from there, it's only ammo you need. And in your case, clays if you want. I know of mini-clays and Handheld launchers you can get - relatively cheap I think. Try to talk to land owners and farmers. They regularly go on shoots. Ask If you can go along on one. You may start by beating the bushes, but you'll soon be shooting as well. Soon you'll know a lot of land owners (they usually all go on each others shoots) and can ask them if you can use their land independently.

But what people keep missing is that though Villas-Boas likes a strong scoring threat/cut in winger and a wide man, we already have both of those at Spurs, just not on the sides AVB played them at Porto. Lennon is a much better crosser than Bale, and laying the ball off is his preferred method of attack. Bale, on the other hand, loves to run at people with the ball at his feet, to attack first and pass second... Which is fine, but it means that he's an attack-minded cut in winger.... And I think AVB sees that.

I truly think AVB will just flip his normal formation and allow Bale and Lennon to stay the first choice wings, using Gio and Falque for cover.

The other option here is that AVB makes Bale and Lennon switch flanks; Puts Bale on his left cutting in. Not sure how that would work, but I trust AVB not to be completely stupid about his formation.",0,1342101230,null,0,false,0,c5cy9rd,t3_wfsm2,t1_c5cy9rd,t3_wfsm2,null,1429357878,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

&gt;Two different studies, one across Britain and one in Wales, looked at the effects of control on fox numbers by hunting with dogs. The first study assessed fox numbers using counts of fox droppings in 1-km squares distributed across Britain in 1999-2000. Following a nationwide temporary ban on hunting with hounds during an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Britain, the survey of 1-km squares was repeated. There was no difference in fox density before and after the temporary ban in eight out of nine lowland regions. In eastern England fox numbers had increased after the ban but the authors attributed this increase to the general recovery of fox populations in the region following widespread persecution during the 19th century. 

&gt;A second study was carried out in commercial forests in Wales in 2003-2004. Counts of fox droppings were used to assess the impact of gun-packs on fox numbers. More foxes were killed where more foxes were present or vice versa and the intensity of culling over winter did not appear to affect the number of foxes the following spring. Therefore the authors concluded that a ban on the use of dogs was unlikely to lead to changes in fox density.

so, to sum up, the NHS wastes billions and the treatment isn't very good and the people are rude. in my book that's not very good. of course you're entitled to your opinion, perhaps that's the kind of service you want, i'd be happy for you if i could just opt-out.",0,1342102145,null,0,false,0,c5cygsb,t3_we6zq,t1_c5cygsb,t1_c5cy2ym,null,1429357971,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

By killing a person you take away his life, by assaulting or stealing from him you essentially take away from the quality of his life too.

So why does the torture of animals not fall under the same category?  Simply because they cannot voice their objections?

And if I have my first assumption wrong should we not then allow assault and murder?

I've often heard talk about the concept of the state being a 'monopoly on violent force' and I've always seem it as oversimplified reductionism as if the state was a black-and-white agent of repression instead of a foundation of a working society.

Also, from the wiki article - ""...in which decisions made by a majority place its interests so far above those of an individual or minority group as to constitute active oppression""  - somehow I don't think preventing torture counts as active oppression.  I'm sure those poor oppressed toffs will find something else to do.

&gt;What subject area are you in?

My project is on scaling up dye-sensitised solar cell technology so it can be integrated into steel building envelope material; Tata Steel Europe is my industrial partner. The project requires knowledge of physics, chemistry and materials science.

&gt; What university (if you don't mind telling)?

Swansea University, although day-to-day I work at an off-site research facility ([SPECIFIC](http://specific.eu.com))

&gt; How many hours a week do you work?

My timesheet requires I log 35 hours week although I usually average around 40. Also worth noting is that I get paid a bursary of £16,600pa and, because I'm a full-time student, am exempt from council tax and national insurance.

&gt; Do you feel you are better off in academia than in industry?

Financially? Industry. As far as quality of life is concerned? Academia.

&gt; What do you wish you had known before taking on a PhD?

The wording implies I have regrets. I can honestly say I have none!

Reasons behind doing the EngD: I did a BEng in Materials Science &amp; Engineering at the same university and happened to be given a dye-sensitised solar cell project for my 3rd year dissertation. I enjoyed the thrill of research so much that I applied for the doctorate.

""9.3% of all homicides committed during 2010/11in England and Wales involved the use of a firearm, the highest proportion since 2001/02."" So criminals who murder are still using guns. Then ban hasn't reduced gun murders as a percentage of all murders.

Also page 5 has a graph which shows that gun crime now is identical to it was before the ban. And after the ban in 1997, gun crime rose for many years, and is now back down again. Some of that may be due to new laws - it doesn't say.

In the British Journal of Criminology, there's this article which says the only thing the new laws prevented was gun suicide. According to their analysis, the ban did nothing to prevent crime or murder.

Who knows. I guess we can't ever really know what effect a ban had. Either way, gun crime in the UK is incredibly low",0,1342104927,null,0,false,0,c5cz4da,t3_wfnc2,t1_c5cz4da,t1_c5cy40d,null,1429358349,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

1. Yes. (Currently living in the city, so no point having more than an air rifle for targets and rabbits on my friend's farm) I was introduced to rifle and shotgun shooting by my grandfather, who was a farmer. Being taught from an early age to respect the gun, and what you're shooting gives you a different perspective to most other people in the UK who only see firearms carried by the occasional police officer, or members of the armed forces.

2. Yes. I enjoy pistol shooting when I am in the US (I lived / worked there for a couple of years round about 2001/2) I am watching the Scottish air rifle laws with interest, since I have one... If they change the law to require them to be licensed, then I'll apply for a FAC, and get a decent rifle. Fuck 'em - if they're going to make it more difficult, then I might as well just go the distance!

3. Depends on the shooter :-) I know armed police officers (having done some training with them), Royal Marines, and Army types, as well as landed gentry, clays enthusiasts, farmers and keepers... I've only ever briefly met one dangerous fool, who was told impolitely to fuck off from a pheasant shoot... Most of the firearms users I know are farmers though, and they, like me, tend to view them as a tool of the trade.

4. In terms of difficulty, I've signed FAC applications for people before, and know plenty of people who could sign for me... But the question is why bother? When I was on my grandparents' farm, I could pick up the .22 and wander out the back door and shoot targets and vermin. Here, there would be no end of hassle storing and transporting a rifle / shotgun. If / when I move to the country, I'd definitely get an agreement to shoot over some land, and get a nice rifle and shotgun. 

In terms of expense, it's as expensive as you make it I suppose. You can pick up a nice Anschutz .22 for £100, and .22LR is cheap as chips. A farmer's shotgun is usually a couple of hundred pounds... A nice rifle for game though, that's where it would get pricey for me!

true,karadan100,cnty-england,Cambridgeshire,"It's actually rather simple. It's about the size of the brain and the complexity of the animal housing that brain. An ant does not have the cognitive function of a dog. It does not feel remorse, empathy or fear. It is a basic-programmed insect with a highly limited set of commands it runs by. There are various levels of cognitive function and all mammals display higher levels of this. This is not pseudo-science. This is actual science.

Animals have a right to a quality of life. That's not to say we cannot eat them. We are omnivores after all. Our bodies are perfect for hunting grazing animals. It's just that we used to use spears and now we use assembly lines. There's a lot of legislation in place to reduce the suffering of animals in an abattoir. They use special guns which fire loaded springs into the brain, killing the animal instantly. Up until that point, the quality of its life has been superb compared to standards we see in other countries.

People are going to eat meat whether we like it or not. At least we try to stem any cruelty that may come the animals way before and during culling.

The ONLY thing which differentiates us from other higher mammals is language. If cows were a higher mammal, then you can bet we wouldn't be allowed to eat them. They'd be as revered as dogs. We'd relate to them more because as humans, we anthropomorphise animals. The more we relate to them, the less tasty they seem to be. That isn't arbitrary. It's an evolutionary trait. Look it up.


With this in mind, it should be understood that foxes have an innate capacity for fear and terror. Letting a pack of dogs rip one apart after an hour-long chase would seem a little over-the-top, especially as the people doing the hunting don't actually eat the fox afterwards. It's done for sport and it really isn't very nice. Just like bull fighting isn't very nice. The only reason they hold onto their 'right' to do it is down to tradition. There's no logical reason to for it to be done. A farmer and a 12-bore would have far more success and the death of the fox would be instant.

Almost all mammals and many avian, arthropod and fish species are self-aware. If you don't believe this then you're probably not going to do the research into the thousands of studies which prove this.

If something has been taken out, then something else, probably man made and not good for us, has had to replace it.

If the tongue senses that something sweet is on the tongue, let's say diet coke, then the brain thinks, mmmmmmmmmmmm, sugar is on its way and will start to get prepared. But it doesn't get any sugar because the sugar has been taken out and replaced with some shit.

The brain then thinks, hang on, I was expecting sugar, I want sugar but didn't get any. So it will send signals demanding sugar and the user (us) will probably drink more of the stuff to do as our brain is ordering.

I have a lot of problems with what they do, but equally I can recognise their qualities (of which there are many). Making spurious hyperbolic statements about them is not a remotely objective analysis of what they are/do. Oh here's one:

&gt; They don't seem to put much effort into it at all.

This is such a ludicrous statement it's laughable. Are you saying that they don't commit thousands of man hours of effort to producing the news every day? Are you suggesting that they have no concept of quality and don't care about the output they produce? Are you aware of the editorial fact-checking policies they engage and (in the vast majority of cases) apply methodically? Are you proposing that they don't go to great lengths to make the output available in many different places around the world, in many different formats across different media? Because of course they do do all of that... so how does it follow that don't seem to put much effort in?

Also, at one point, they got workers to switch departments and try out other people's line of work.  They were laughing at how these high earners couldn't do the basic job of the call center... of course they can't - they're not trained to. Just like those call center workers couldn't fix a pipe.

What has amazed me is the increase in ticket price between when I first went (IIRC it was below or around the £100 mark for weekend camping) and what it is now (£197 for a weekend camping ticket). 

I can't see how the festival proper has been vastly improved so explain to me why the cost has almost doubled? 

As far as in-arena prices goes, can't say I like them but it is something I've gotten used to. On the bright side you could eat and drink as much as you wanted as long as you don't go into the music section - so it was a bit of a no brainer to have your dinner and get trashed outside, then go in. Smuggling alcohol in wasn't that hard either - especially on colder and wetter days. Unless they've started body patting people? 

I'd love to be all idealistic and say that festivals should be all about a mutual love of the music (man) but Reading - even when I went - was populated with fairly rich kids. 

The *one* thing I really find disgusting is the price of clean drinking water. Everyone needs it and it should be a basic human right - not something to make people pay through the nose for. Alcohol? Different story. I'd love a cheap pint like anyone would - but at least that comes down to a choice of wanting alcohol, not a *need* of needing a drink.",0,1342108576,null,0,false,0,c5d02jj,t3_wfkt6,t1_c5d02jj,t1_c5cxjd6,null,1429358793,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

As to the gun laws - there are still a lot of restrictions before you can get your hands on a licence such as proof of training, proof of a secure place to keep the gun, keeping gun and ammo separate and having a good reason to own one.

Some US states don't require much beyond an ID. 

&gt; Gun restrictions do absolutely nothing to prevent criminals from having them. The laws only affect law-abiding people. 

At first glance that seems pretty clear, but I'm just not sure it's true - the gun laws mean that anyone with a gun stands out pretty quickly and if you see a gun it is a big red flag.  Unless said criminal is very, very careful with the gun he's going to stick out like a sore thumb.  

Not only that, the lack of other guns means carrying one during a crime becomes a major escalation - if you, as a criminal, know that your victims aren't armed and even the police probably aren't carrying you're less likely to decide to carry a gun in the first place and more likely to get tough sentences if you do.",0,1342109033,null,0,false,0,c5d070w,t3_wfnc2,t1_c5d070w,t1_c5czufb,null,1429358852,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I rather enjoyed the idea that the Doctor somehow got married, but found it strange that he would possibly marry someone who seemed so normal (I thought he was against the whole idea of marrying someone who would age at a rate much faster than he would?)

All in all, I guess she will age normally--but how fast does a Time-Lord age, really? It's hard to know. I guess I don't really know. Regardless, I liked the idea that she was in the Doctor's future and I honestly was hoping we'd never see her again. I was hoping she was WAY WAY WAY in the Doctor's future. When I found out she was going to be one of the major characters with Doctor #11, I was a little unhappy about it. To me I feel like she gets in the way of more Doctor character development. I feel like she weighs down the story. I feel like the character Alex Kingston portrays is flimsy and constantly changes and I really dislike the fact that we never really know where River is within her personality shifting. If there's one thing we can look forward to it's that she does die--it's just a matter of when since we don't know how long the life-span of a Time-Lord is when they live out their current regeneration...
