true,LeAnimeGuy,null,null,"She is a very flat character now. when she had a role as being Arthur secret love interest she was far more diverse with what she had to do. She had a nice part to play in the first two episodes where she was to execute the servant but that has been the only thing she has done this series. 

I have been waiting for her to do something big and been kind of disappointed on that behalf. I want her to get worried about Arthur and run out to save him, pretend to kidnap arthur and go have a romantic break together, prove she is a capable queen by uncovering a Morgana plot or even just leave the castle and talk to someone any thing. Seeing her in the throne room every episode looking out of place and not doing much is a waste of the character development up to this point.

I like that Mithian tried several times to break free- shows what sort of character she is, and how powerful Morgana is. 

Loved Gaius doing Magic. That was wonderful! I'd like to see him do that a bit more often. 

Part of me really wishes that Arthur had stopped himself without Merlin telling him to stop, show just how mcuh this wasn't about revenge, but at the same time, it showed that Merlin is there to keep Arthur in check, to make sure Arthur does what is right and good, so it had a purpose, plus the conversation with Gwen at the end about how Merlin ought to get some credit was really well done. We've been crying for Merlin to get credit for a while, and it seems like Arthur has finally decided to voice the fact that Merlin is a valuable asset. 

This is also the second episode (In a row) that Merlin has doubted a course of action and Arthur has turned it around to say ""If you were in my position, would you do any different?"" I think it shows that Arthur is listening, but knows that He's doing not only what he has to do but also what Merlin would do- and as Merlin is his conscious essentially, He's proving that it is what has to be done.

Is Torres more consistent then 12 months ago? Yes. Is he playing with more hunger and desire? Yes. Is he playing better football? Yes. Is this enough? No. He is nowhere near scoring consistently for us yet, and his goals may not all be match winners, but I believe we are seeing a rejuvenated Nando and that our patience is about to payoff. 

It is also worth remembering that we have not always had that deadly striker, and that we have always been blessed with goals from other parts of the team, like Lamps, and in Mata and Hazard I believe we have found other outlets. 

We sadly have a history of strikers being bought, and them being subject to ""unfair"" conditions as it were. From what I can tell, Nando is suffering in the same way Sheva did. Neither really fit into the managers plans, yet were almost forced into the squad for the sake of it. I feel like if by January  his form has remained consistent, as it is now, we perhaps look at the youth options and rotate Piazon or Feruz for a few minutes here and there. The last thing we need is to spunk another £40+m on a rotation option. Otherwise, look at cash, and perhaps loan Torres back to Atletico. However, for the time being (with the window closed) all we can do is support and get behind the guys we have. What's been and gone is over, and there is no use dwelling on it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Pedophilia is defined as a psychiatric disorder in persons who are 16 years of age or older typically characterized by a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children (generally age 13 years or younger, though onset of puberty varies).

Right, exactly what I said.

&gt;We're talking about a paedophile ring, not the de facto womanising culture.

On what basis do you assert this was an organised ring?

Here's where I disagree with you, firstly I'm wearing a Suarez jersey as I type this so as to show you that I'm not biased or any nonsense. Diving should be banned as well as hacking a player on defense when the ref isn't watching. 

&gt;Hell, it isn't too much different than fouling someone on defense and then throwing your hands up in order to say ""I didn't touch him."" Let's leave the banning for serious offences, not dives.

Not to mention that most words have multiple meanings and the meaning which is intended is only clear from context.

I don't dispute the deeper message behind all of these linguistic shenanigans - that a self-interested elite uses a veneer of consent, as well as trickery, coercion and force as required to impose its will - but the ""freeman"" approach isn't helpful, it's actually borderline psychotic.  Yes, it's true the State uses its citizens as milkable assets to borrow against and enrich the wealthy, but if you don't recognise their laws and courts, [you're still sure as shit going to be made to recognise their prisons](http://www.winnipegsun.com/2012/02/27/natural-person-evades-taxes-headed-to-jail---naturally).

For more on the dubiousness of the whole ""Freeman on the land"" thing, see [here](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Freeman_on_the_land).

 2. BT's exchange equipment is old enough in many parts of the UK that this is not a per-subscriber feature; it's all-or-nothing for an entire switch.

In fact, if you accept that knowing your future creates a fixed point in time, then by telling Amy about her future the Doctor was assuring it would have to happen that way, aka the way we saw it as viewers. And they don't have to know its because of the Doctor that their life is the way it is for that to be true. Mels is a perfect example of that.

As for the other companions, are you seriously trying to tell me those characters would be how they ended up if the Doctor had not been a substantial part of their lives? I disagree. Everything about why you love them is thanks to the Doctor. Captain Jack is a *perfect* example. Even after he becomes head of Torchwood he spends years, perhaps even centuries, hunting the Doctor down through history so he (Jack) can try and join up with him again.

true,BrokenClockwerk,lfc50,,"It's a cliche, but form goes out the window in derbies. We need to field a strong side, but more importantly, we need to field a side that will play intensely. If we look weak or timid or ""safe"", Everton is going to try and exploit it. Without Fellaini and Peinaar, they are weaker, but not toothless.

Here's who I think should play.

Reina: Yes, Jones has been great, but if Reina is fit, he needs to start. This is the kind of game that will decide whether he has a place in the net for us anymore. If he can't bring his best to the Merseyside Derby, then it's time we move on. This needs to be his test, and he needs to be up for it.

Agger-Skrtel: Agger and Srktel are our best center defenders and they are tough and will lend experience that our fullbacks will lack.

Wisdom-Robinson: They're hungry and talented and need the experience. These will be great games for them to really get a feel for the intensity of playing for Liverpool. Supported by Agger and Skrtel, they should do well.

Gerrard-Allen-Shelvey: Gerrard always brings his A-game to the derby, and I think Shelvey has the intensity to make this match a special one. He'll need to be careful about tackles and make sure he doesn't get sent off again, but I think he will be more help than trouble in a situation like this. With Lucas still out, Allen needs to be our midfield rock, enough said.

Sterling-Suarez-Suso: We need Suarez, so he's a duh, and Sterling and Suso are much like Wisdom/Robinson.

Omissions and Why: Johnson deserves a rest. He's been playing nearly every game and should get a break, and Robinson deserves a run out. Carragher is a great player to have in the derby, but I think his experience is hampered by his lack of pace, and for this one, I'd feel more comfortable without him, if Wisdom and Robinson started. Sahin is a great player, but I think he should get a bit of a rest as well, and I think Shelvey will stay involved all game, where Sahin might end up a bit invisible. Assaidi should definitely sub on, because his pace and tricky footwork make him a nightmare, and he'll be able to fuck with a tiring Everton defense.

Here's the lineup that will most likely ACTUALLY start

I would like to see Suso and Sterling starting, and Assaidi replacing either one of them later on in the game (depending on how well they perform).
&gt;Shoiuld Shelvey be in the team?

I don't think he will be starting, instead, I feel that he would come on as a sub for Sahin, possibly.

&gt;How about Enrique?

I think Enrique should start as our left back and Johnson on the right. I'm somewhat afraid that Wisdom may not be able to cope with the pressure of the Merseyside Derby. On the other hand... I feel that he does. It's a 50/50, but I'm hoping Enrique starts.

Okay fine, I just like Enrique because he's cool.

**Other Random Thoughts**

+ Enrique starts as LB, Wisdom as RB, and Johnson to come on later?
+ Enrique coming on as a winger again?

The ""bricks"" are actually lines drawn on a smooth facade, in order to give the appearance of even brickwork. The ""brickwork"" used to be yellow, but pollution turned it black. When the whole place was restored, the builders were instructed to paint it black once more, as it was the colour to which people had become accustomed. The foundations were poorly built, even for the time, given the swamp on which the terrace was constructed. The whole place was built at the lowest possible price, which I found surprising given the status it enjoys today.

Churchill complained that Number 10 was “shaky and lightly built by the profiteering contractor whose name they bear.”

Same goes for the garden.

It's a shame that it's not really somewhere that members of the public can visit/see more of, though obviously this would be impractical and a major security risk. It's absolutely steeped in history and a wonderful building. 

As an alternative to chillin' with Larry the Cat, I can strongly recommend visiting the houses of Parliament for anybody in that area - I think it's still free to visit and there are regular tours, or you can go self-guided. I'd recommend checking what's being discussed in the houses though, for things like PMQs and topical debates the place gets very busy very early in the day, but if it's something that doesn't attract a lot of interest you can usually get in without much of a queue and sit in the galleries.

I recall they were, but the materials used in the interior were still pretty shoddy.

I had a chat with the builder's agent afterwards, and once she realised that I wasn't buying, she admitted that ""these properties are more aimed at someone who wants everyone to see that they have an expensive house. That's why the outside looks impressive. The interior isn't that good.""

This left me wondering. If someone buys a house to create an impression, don't they ever invite anyone inside?

true,KarmaAndLies,null,null,"Dear god man, paragraphs!    

&gt; Voting is something ingrained in citizenship.    

Prisoners aren't full-citizens while they're in prison, they lost that right when they broke the law. They still have some rights but those rights are curtailed.    

&gt; uncomfortable with the government being able to mess around with legislation on that level so easily    

The government isn't ""messing"" with anything, the EU is. Prisoners haven't been able to vote in our lifetimes. Additionally since we're constitution-less, the government can legislate most things (there are some restrictions, but none that apply here).   

&gt; These issues should be treated more like constitutional issues or some equivalent, rather than issues of government policy.    

We don't have a constitution.    

&gt; Maybe the EU should have more say on this matter since it defines human rights legislation etc.    

More say than being the highest authority over the UK? You can't really have more say than that outside of invasion.    

&gt; As thickARMS points out, prisoners not voting isn't in line with rehabilitative practices    

It doesn't help with rehabilitation but I'm yet to see any evidence that it hurts.    

The reason prisoners often re-offend are issues like being unable to get a job (due to criminal history, lack of experience, gap in employment, etc), social isolation (e.g. their friends are all either criminals or have moved/left), and addictions like drugs, alcohol, or more specific things (e.g. addiction to theft, to sex , paedophilia, etc).      

&gt; we are not going to get anywhere if prisons don't make more efforts to release people as BETTER CITIZENS, people who feel like they are citizens and a part of society, otherwise the situation is going to go round in circles at this base level.    

I agree entirely. But where has the government, or the previous three governments done anything to address that?    

I think giving them the vote is the least important issue in the discussion about rehabilitation. I absolutely want them to be able to get on with their lives but the system is set up to make sure they cannot, and that they continue to suffer long after they're free.   

As I said earlier show me why inability to vote is such a huge deal but practical issues like money, jobs, and housing aren't?    

&gt; Taking the vote from prisoners is non-progressive   

We aren't ""taking"" anything. Prisoners have never had the right to vote.    

I mean this in a respectful way, but you really don't understand this issue at all. You don't even understand what is being discussed from either side's perspective. You seem to think that we're taking away prisoners rights (wrong), that we have a constitution (wrong), that that constitution somehow limits what government can do (wrong), and that the EU is trying to force us not to take these rights away (wrong).

In response to you asking about what taxes are used for, then there are both good uses and bad uses for our collective money. Arresting people for joking on twitter and bombing third world countries are, in my opinion, a crap use of money. However the little things that go on, usually without note or mention, such as providing education, law enforcement, healthcare, etc, stand up by themselves to be something I'm pretty thankful for. However, the two extremes are, by and large, disconnected. Having our roads well surfaced doesn't make up for our tax money being used to bomb third world countries in the same way that bailing out ""casino banks"" doesn't make my weekly bin collections rubbish.

true,cyborg_127,lfc68,,"Denied a win by officials, unless that was for something other than offside - which I very much doubt. Post match commentary shows just how late that linesman lifts his flag, utter bullshit.

Couple of errors gave them two goal, Jones with a clearing punch totally in the wrong direction. A backline failure, particularly Enrique who was very static for the second goal.

Suarez deserved his MOTM, good to see he's making a mockery of being called a diver. Didn't dive once the entire match, and Neville got carded for Simulation, but the media won't talk about that you can be sure. Post-match interview (on now) Neville is basically berating himself for diving.

Jones (unfortunately) proved his second string status. He deserved the chance to prove himself, but to me Reina should be back as the starter.

Our youngsters had a hard time of it in such a big game. Sterling cooled his head after the yellow, and got himself back in the game after half time, did well. Wisdom got torn a new one on the right, but wasn't helped much by Suso not coming back. You could see the difference when Shelvey came on and was helping. 

Gerrard. Well, I hate to say it but he does not have the consistently good balls from corners and set pieces he used to. Time to get someone else to take some of these.

Skrtel and Agger: What can I say? It was a great day when they re-signed with the club. Very good defensive pairing, could have been worse if not for them. Skrtel was lucky to not give away a penalty, however.

All in all, it's looking very promising for the future. We have a number of injuries, and to show that we have some depth (not up front, not quite yet) to the squad that we can still perform on a derby day is a relief. Yes, we should have won that.

We were far more competitive in the second half, but still didn't dictate the game like we're used to doing. The change in formation definitely helped slow down the game, but we had almost nothing going forward.

I honestly think Sterling should have come off at the half rather than Suso. He wasn't having nearly enough impact on the game to risk him getting a second yellow. 

Still, we got a decent result. We would have won if not for a terrible linesman decision. We can't continue to play this poorly and expect to compete for the top four.

I can't say we deserved the three points, but its games like that can change the mentality of a squad (seriously that would of been one of the greatest derbys' of all time).

After the nutty first half, i though BR made good changes. But we as ever are still reliant on suarez to win us games. Wisdom fell well short today, and these things happenwhen ur that young, but i can honestly say that wisdom and enrique are not who we should be having as a primary full backs in the short term.
Sterling had a beaut, he's really coming along. Especially after the rough first half he put his head down and really should have scored.
Suarez obviously MOTM. Should have won it for us. Seriously when that fire in his belly is directed towards football rather than refereeing he is one of the best in the world.

I cant say we didn't deserve a draw though. Everton were immense especially Baines and Marales ripping through our lines and Fellani as towering as ever. One of the first times i saw Allen not being able to control the ball comfortably and he was really outmuscled by Fellani.

true,jihangir,null,null,"&gt;Let's stop asking hypothetical questions for a minute, and let me ask you why you haven't emigrated to a society which more suits your beliefs?

It's something I'm considering. I got back to the UK after a month in India on Thursday, and I greatly admire the Indian citizen's economic and personal freedoms, despite those freedoms arising ""by default"" through an inefficient, corrupt government and a cultural disrespect for the rule of law, rather than a principled pro-liberty stance. The problem is that salaries are considerably lower over there than they are here. I would have to move there and start my own business for it to be cost-effective, and that's not something I'm ready to do yet.

The problem is that I love the British people and the British culture. I don't really want to abandon the place and run off selfishly into the distance. I have family here that depend on me, and I'm not really prepared to leave them to the socialist wolves.

&gt;The answer is that you benefit from our socialised and nationalised system too much for you to even consider these possibilities.

I personally try not to use the state's services as much as possible. There's not much I can do about using the roads, but I can afford private healthcare, and I choose to pay for it. Firstly because I don't like the idea of other people paying for my healthcare, and secondly because the NHS is a terribly over-burdened institution, and I believe public healthcare (if it has to is exist) should be reserved for those that can't afford private healthcare.

But in other areas, I try to boycott the welfare state. My wife is currently unemployed and looking for a job, and has been for half a year. We're probably entitled to a good £600 a month in benefits, yet we both choose not to claim them out of pride. We're willing to sacrifice my living standards and survive on one salary if it means other hard-working people aren't being forced to give us their hard-earned money.",0,1351439690,null,0,false,0,c6swxtz,t3_127ozx,t1_c6swxtz,t1_c6swhq9,null,1430259377,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

**Check this out**: 

 - Dominating v West Brom then ref gives two extremely harsh penalties to West Brom and a red card which was NEVER a red. Could have won that one but lets let it slide and say 1 point was lost.

 - Penalty to Suarez not given v Sunderland. 2 points lost.

 - Harsh red card for Shelvey v united. Then clear penalty to Suarez not given and a generous (to say the least) penalty given to united. 2 points lost

 - Now they are just literally cancelling our goals when they want to for no reason. 2 points taken away from us v Everton.

So all in all thats **SEVEN** points directly taken from us from refs. We'd be on 17 points, same as united (if you take one point off them that they were given) We'd be joint fucking third!!!! And we are 11th.

Denied a win by officials, unless that was for something other than offside - which I very much doubt. Post match commentary showed just how late that linesman lifts his flag, utter bullshit. Suarez was off celebrating before that flag came up which looked to be due to the Everton players complaining loudly rather than any proper reason.

Couple of errors gave them two goal, Jones with a clearing punch totally in the wrong direction. A backline failure, particularly Enrique who was very static for the second goal.

Suarez deserved his MOTM, good to see he's making a mockery of being called a diver. Didn't dive once the entire match, and Neville got carded for Simulation, but the media won't talk about that you can be sure. Post-match interview Neville basically berated himself for diving, at least that's something. But he had to.

Jones (unfortunately) proved his second string status. He deserved the chance to prove himself, but to me Reina should be back as the starter.

Our youngsters had a hard time of it in such a big game. Sterling cooled his head after the yellow, and got himself back in the game after half time, did well. Should have had a goal in the one-on-one, shame to chip it well wide. Wisdom got torn a new one on the right in the first half, but wasn't helped much by Suso not coming back. You could see the difference when Shelvey came on and was helping. 

Gerrard. Well, I hate to say it but he does not have the consistently good balls from corners and set pieces he used to. Time to get someone else to take some of these.

Skrtel and Agger: What can I say? It was a great day when they re-signed with the club. Very good defensive pairing, could have been worse if not for them. Skrtel was lucky to not give away a penalty, however.

All in all, it's looking very promising for the future. We have a number of injuries, and to show that we have some depth (not up front, not quite yet) to the squad that we can still perform on a derby day is a relief. Yes, we should have won that. A couple of mistakes under pressure gave Everton a way back into the game.

true,Brodiaq,null,null,"Lennon was once again very very good, every time he gets the ball and runs at the defense it causes them a lot of problems. Consistently a bright spot every week. 

Sandro was very good when we needed him in defence. Might have saved the game with his face, though I think Friedel might have saved it anyway. Kept possession well, passed well, put in a motm performance in my opinion. 

Friedel had a great save on the initial back heel off that phantom corner, not sure if Lloris would have done any better in grabbing the ball or pushing it out further/ harder. Lloris probably should be starting, but I'm not sure it would have mattered on that particular play. 

Vertonghen was very solid today, Walker and Gallas didn't assist any of Southhampton's goals so that was good, Caulker was solid.

Dempsey looked way better than he has I thought. Went forward instead of backwards, did a pretty good job keeping possession in some hairy situations, had the game winner, and made some nice passes that created a few chances for other players. Won a few free kicks. His work rate was good, and was always in the box looking for loose balls. 

Defoe looked downright silly on some of those shots. Not much to say, his movement was good and he put himself in positions to score goals just didn't finish any of them. That being said it was Defoe's rebound that Dempsey put in so he was still important and besides the finishing I thought he looked alright.

THudd looked average. Had the assist but besides that nothing sticks out to me too much. Average performance I thought. 

Livermore did not look good. Gave away too many fouls on defense and had some wayward passes. Siggy wasn't in enough to really have an effect I thought. Would have liked to see how well a Dempsey-Siggy would have worked if we had any decent possession while they were on together. 

Bale's header was fantastic and he had a couple good crosses. Worked hard and had a solid game. He dropped back deeper as the game went on to help in defense and was always a threat going forward. Glad he got one for his daughter.

First half overall we looked great, got goals, dominated possession, second half was the opposite. Missing Dembele's influence in the midfield in our link up play. In the end 3 points is 3 points. Successful afternoon in my opinion.

Ramires Goal: Great detemination from Mata and Oscar, and a great header to finish it off. Overall, showed great spirit.

Ivanovic Card: Borderline. Yes, Young made the most of it and Ivanovic was just trying to get on his other side, but there was contact and he was the last man. According to the rules it's a straight red, and you can't blame the ref here.

Torred Card: Fucking bullshit, nothing more to say. If they want to take diving out of the game, this is not the way.

Chicharito Goal: Fucking bullshit, he was behind Cech - it doesn't get more offside than that.

Against a team with old-fashioned pacey touchline hugging wingers like United (e.g. Valencia and Young) we either expose our selves to counterattacks on the wing as our fullbacks bomb forward or sacrifice width as the fullbacks focus on defensive duties. 
2. Torres - Had one chance against De Gea, went down rather easily against Evans' contact. I feel he chose to go down rather than continue his run after nutmegging the defender. To be honest, was not a goal threat on the same level as United's Van Persie. 
3. Poor start. Went 2 goal down early, though we dominated the middle half of the 90mins we need to start more sharply, with greater concentration. The starters had clocked up a lot of game minutes, a bit of squad rotation may alleviate the problem.

A charity's role is to be ready to be exploited so it help those at the bottom.
eg: I have broken my leg, can you me get back onto my feet.

However, if something such as breaking your leg did occur, then you shouldn't have to be forced to either fork up money to a private concern or to ask for help from a charity. You should have a third alternative which is a government.
eg: I have paid my taxes, and in return thank you very much for my healthcare.

true,Robertej92,crest2,,"I'm gonna do this from memory so some stats might be wrong. 

Everton was founded in 1878 under the name St Domingos FC, we bobbed along nicely for a few years then moved to Anfield in 1884, but fell out with the owner of the ground and moved out in 1892 with some bunch of amateurs called Liverpool FC taking our place, doomed to never win a title themselves obviously. During our time at Anfield we also became a founding member of the Football League in 1889 and won it for the first time in 1891. After we left Anfield we of course went to Goodison Park, other than a league title and FA Cup win nothing much happened until the mid 20s when things kicked off again with legends like Ted Sagar and of course Dixie Dean playing for the club, Sagar in particular lasted from the twenties through to the fifties. 

Dixie got the record 60 league goals in a season in 1927/28, a season after a Middlesborough player had scored 59. Sucks to be him. Before WW2 broke out we had a striker called Tommy Lawton who looked like he could emulate Dixie Dean but war interrupted him in his peak and he never reached the heights he should have. Now if we zip through to the 60s we had the holy trinity, which was our midfield trio of Colin Harvey, Alan Ball and Howard Kendall, Alex Young was also a special talent, and this was the time of our first great manager Harry Catterick, we won 2 league titles in the 60s along with an FA Cup, our left back Ray Wilson was part of Englands WC winning squad and another winner Alan Ball would join the team shortly after to beautiful results.

The seventies were mediocre, with a string of managers waltzing in and out of the club until 1980 when Howard Kendall, commonly considered our greatest manager, joined the club as manager, he would go on to have 3 seperate spells at the club but his first was by far the most successful, winning two league titles, an FA Cup and most memorably of all our first European trophy, the European Cup Winners Cup. This was a tournament that did exactly what it said on the tin, with the winners of each countries equivalent of the FA Cup qualifying for it, since the domestic cup was more prestigious back then it was generally a harder competition than the UEFA Cup which positioned it as the 2nd biggest European trophy. The players of note in this era include Neville Southall (all time top appearances and champion pie eater), Dave Watson, Graeme Sharp, Trevor Steven, Andy Hinchcliffe, Gary Lineker, Kevin Ratcliffe, Peter Reid (He's fat, he's round, he's worth a million pounds). After Heysel we were kicked out of Europe which led to an exodus of players and we never really recovered.

On to darker times, the 90s. This is where most evertonians burst in to tears. Pretty much all the way up until 2002, with the exception of a small bump in the mid 90s under Joe Royle, this period was marred by constant relegation battles. We did win an FA Cup in 1995 under Joe Royle though. THere are few shining lights of this era, Duncan Ferguson of course, Andrei Kanchelskis, Watson and Southall were still in the squad through to the late 90s, on the management front Howard Kendall made two failed returns, Joe Royle had a short but fruitful reign and then Walter Bloody Smith came in, his terrible transfers along with the collapse of a deal with ITV digital helped lead to our financial struggles. I'm gonna leave the Moyes era since I assume you'll know a fair bit about that.

Somewhere like De Pijp or Jordaan in Amsterdam would be my first preference. Being able to walk somewhere is more than the sum of the parts of having a pavement and a zebra crossing. It involves a mix of correctly framed outdoor rooms, street-scapes, suitable parks, mixed use buildings, effective public transport, neighbourhoods with actual notable *personalities*, and places you'd just like to *be* for the simple reason they're nice places to spend your time on Earth.

I live in Bristol, and will often just walk around for hours when I intend to pick up some bread and milk from the corner shop, because it's a pleasant thing to do. I know it sounds nebulous and airy-fairy, but dormitory towns that spring up in twelve weeks with a giant Tesco in the middle surrounded by a huge carpark are my idea of hell, and developers that push them are demons.

Of COURSE our offense collapses when he comes on - he's a defensive midfielder that might as well be a 5th defender. He's a damn good defender, too. His job isn't to make forward runs and distribute the ball, it's to drop back into defense and cover when the wingbacks make their forward runs.

It's not his fault our offense collapsed, it's because we lack another good CM to put in for Huddlestone. Huddlestone can't play a full match. Who else do you put in for him other than Livermore?

Livermore worked much better with Redknapp's system because the wingbacks were much more involved there. In the AVB system we need people that move farther forward.

If we were playing a 4-3-3 with our whole squad fully fit he would fit in perfectly in front of Kaboul and Vert, dropping back when one of the two moves forward with the ball. Sandro has great attacking potential but we're lucky in the fact that he hasn't been caught too far forward.

You won't have that problem with Livermore. He has much more positional discipline.

true,Dossena,null,null,"Just got in (went to a mates house to watch the game) so late to the party. Will post my (long-winded) thoughts anyway - not that I expect anyone to read 'em, it just helps me getting my thoughts out into writing:


Before I get to the clusterfuck that was the Officials I'll start by mentioning the bad parts of our game. We were far too sloppy in defence and gifted Everton both of their goals. I don't know what Jones was thinking when he punched the ball into the penalty area. Gift number one. For the second goal Skrtel should have dealt with the ball instead of watching it go across the face of goal - Enrique too, he should stood and watched. Then again the throw-in that lead to that goal should have been a throw-in to us.... 

I think we really should have started with Coates and the 3 at the back formation, we were really struggling with the balls whipped in from Baines directed at Jelavic and Fellaini. Needed more height and power from the start. Likewise I think Shelvey should have started - he's more physical than Sahin and could have dealt better with the physicality of Everton - then again perhaps he was deemed as a risk in getting a red card because he's not afraid to make crunching tackles. I'm very annoyed with Sterling for not squaring it to Suarez when he decided to try and chip the keeper. Think the idea of being the hero got to him. 



Now onto the good; Suarez was out-fucking-standing. Loved the passion and fight he had in him. And that celebration in front of Moyes. Love it. Such a wind-up merchant. But goes to show he only cares what the Liverpool fans think of him, he went through with that celebration knowing he'd probably get a lot of backlash from fans of other teams but he doesn't care. 

Other than when he got greedy as mentioned above Sterling did well in a very tough game. Oh and what an assist by Gerrard, such a good delivery of the ball. 


Now onto the officials... what a complete joke. I really don't like having a go at officials but when we continue to get screwed over you can't not comment on them. Marriner was awful. So inconsistent throughout the game. The fact Fellaini finished the game without being booked is a complete joke and says it all about Marriner's officiating. He (and others) constantly fouled and molested poor wee Joe Allen throughout the game. 

But of course the biggest injustice of them all was all down to that linesman. 

When that goal went in myself and my mate I was watching it with leaped out of our chairs and were screaming in celebration... and then I saw it... the flag indicating the goal was offside. ""NOOOOOOOOOO!"" I cried as I fell to my knees. ""How was that offside"". And then the replay answered me; It wasn't. Simple as that. I felt sick and remained on my knees, hands on my head, for the remainder of the game. 

What a farce. A complete joke. That linesman needs sacking. He knew Suarez was onside otherwise the flag would have went up straight away. No. He bottled it. He saw the Everton players complain, and heard the complaints from the Everton fans so he folded like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy  and raised his shitty little flag. 

Another of my friends afterwards said ""Ah well, you'd have taken a draw before the game""... and perhaps I would have but that isn't the point. We had the 3 points. Then through sloppy play we lost the 3 points. But then through determination and fight we got those 3 points back.... just to have them snatched from us by a wanker with a flag. 


It gets even worse when you look at other games this weekend. Arteta is offside and scores Arsenal's winner; Goal stands. Hernandez is offside and scores Man United's winner; Goal stands. Suarez is ONSIDE and scores our winner; Nope sorry you are not a winner. 

This - combined with the utter laughable officiating of today's Chelsea v United game - is a total embarrassment to our sport. Out of order and something needs to change. But we all know it won't.

true,jihangir,null,null,"&gt;That is inherently socialist.

I'm not forced to help my Mother around the house, I choose to do so. I'm not forced to take my Grandfather shopping, I choose to do so. I voluntarily sacrifice my time (and my diesel) to improve the lives of others, because I want them to be healthy and happy.

Of course I want everyone else, not just my family, to be healthy and happy, too. I share the humanitarian goals of most socialists, just not the means.

Where charity and socialism differ is the use of violent force/coercion. People give charities money because they believe in their cause. People give the government money because they're forced to - failure to pay up eventually results in arrest and imprisonment.

The analogy is thus:

Charity is me coming home from work, and giving my Mother £20 from my pay packet to go shopping with.

Socialism is me coming home from work, and my Father and his friends surrounding me outside the house. They demand my paycheck, and say that they'll overwhelm me, take my paycheck without consent and lock me in the garage if I refuse to give it to them. I give them my paycheck, and they take £20 for my mother's shopping. They then take £5 each for themselves as ""salary"" for the time they spent collecting the £20 for my mother, and give me the remains of my paycheck. If I speak out against this, I'm considered a family traitor, and told that I should go and stay with my cousins in Somalia.

true,jihangir,null,null,"&gt;A private company's role is to exploit you for profit, ready to chase the big money at the top. eg: I have broken my leg, what goods and services are available to me?

That profit is our 'tip', given to a company for their provision of a service or product that people require/desire. Any company that neglects the needs or desires of it's customers doesn't remain solvent for very long, and any company that unreasonably exploits it's customers gets undercut by competitors rather rapidly.

&gt;You should have a third alternative which is a government. eg: I have paid my taxes, and in return thank you very much for my healthcare.

Private health insurers provide exactly the same service, you know. ;)

&gt;Care to explain why you think that charities and private companies are inherently better than a government, and why you would prefer to not have a government taking its own place in society?

Private companies and charities are funded through voluntary interaction, and generally don't use portions of their budget/profit to bomb 3rd world countries, imprison marijuana users or 'engineer' society, which inevitably results in the curtailment of the individual's personal or economic liberties.

&gt;Where I work means that I frequently get a glimpse of not only budgets, but their outcome. . . and actually my local council is extremely thin and efficient.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; 1) We should thank our lucky stars that we escaped with 3 points...that was the worst half of football we've played all season

I think AVB thought the match was in the bag and brought on Livermore to give him some game time. I too thought the match was in the bag, but Livermore was poor, Spurs lost the midfield battle and Southampton picked up their game.

&gt; 3) Defoe was abysmal today...I mean, wow...he had 3-4 chances that not only would they normally be goals, but he didn't even put them on net...I'm pretty sure the one was kicked so high it left the entire stadium

Defoe looks a decent striker. He's obviously not great on the ball and he doesn't always hit the target but his movement is good and all said and done he's a decent finisher. He's no Messi or RVP, but he did what does well well enough. I think you're being harsh on him.

&gt; 6) I'm not trying to be too down on the team, but that was a poor performance, and if we have aspirations of top 4, top 3, whatever, we need to play much better than that.

I thought that overall it was a decent performance. Yes, Southampton ended the game stronger than they started it, but that was always to be expected. The pressure of being 19th in the table and 2-0 down at home was always going to bring out their best.

true,NervousEnergy,eng-yorkshire,Welshman in Yorkshire,"&gt; That profit is our 'tip', given to a company for their provision of a service or product that people require/desire. Any company that neglects the needs or desires of it's customers doesn't remain solvent for very long, and any company that unreasonably exploits it's customers gets undercut by competitors rather rapidly.

Whilst a small company will be made or broken based on its innovation, you do have absolute giants who are completely out of touch with their customers because of their fixation on profits. Let's take my imaginary bus company *First-Arriva-Stage-Veola-Transdev*. There's a good route from the village of Point Ayeston to Point Beesley, that they would like to capitalise on. If two operators ran on this route however, then there just wouldn't be enough for both of them to profit, however this company would have the critical mass to drive out any competitors. They will be able to slash their fares and provide more frequent buses and just absorb the losses until any smaller competitor folds. After that, they then would have a total monopoly on this route. If there was going to be a monopoly on this route, I'd much rather that their intentions and actions reflected need rather than profit, like a nationalised service would.

&gt; Private health insurers provide exactly the same service, you know. ;)

If its exactly the same concept, then what's the point?

&gt; Private companies and charities are funded through voluntary interaction, and generally don't use portions of their budget/profit to bomb 3rd world countries, imprison marijuana users or 'engineer' society, which inevitably results in the curtailment of the individual's personal or economic liberties.

I don't have a choice about getting on the bus to Point Beesley, it is a vital service yet it would be unpractical for there to be more than one provider and have true market capitalism, so my interaction with them will be mandatory.

As for what a private company does with their profits, I'm not sure what ""First-Arriva-Stage-Veola-Transdev"" does in their spare time with their left over money. They could be doing any number of things which causes conflict and engineers society. I suppose that they're just trying to make sure that another Great American Streetcar Scandal doesn't affect their bottom line.

&gt; Relative to what? Without any competing providers, how can you judge how efficient a government body is? Economic (not thermodynamic) efficiency is a completely subjective measure.

Its efficient compared to not only similar unitary authorities but also to other international local governments. It also have staff which are fully capable in using their common sense to know if they're in line with expectations, just like any other monopoly.

&gt;That is never going to change and it is wasted energy to campaign for it. A much more productive use of your time would be to campaign for how the money is spent.

They said the same about slavery. Abolitionists were considered radicals. The vast majority were moderates who considered the abolition of slavery to be an unrealistic goal, and instead argued for just improving the slave's living conditions. Abraham Lincoln, the politician widely celebrated for leading the charge for the emancipation of slaves, [started off as a moderate](http://www.usnews.com/news/history/articles/2009/02/09/abraham-lincolns-great-awakening-from-moderate-to-abolitionist).

It's only because of individuals of conviction taking a principled stance, an idealistic stance, over a compromising one, that we have many of the rights that we have today.

I likely wouldn't create laws for the MPAA, and I probably wouldn't use force to suppress free speech like the recent Twitter joke trials have.

Its all part of the package. Everything in life has its good side and bad sides. If you really are against these policies, then change it. Your apathy and grass-is-greener syndrome isn't the answer, its just noise.

&gt; They said the same about slavery. Abolitionists were considered radicals. The vast majority were moderates who considered the abolition of slavery to be an unrealistic goal, and instead argued for just improving the slave's living conditions. Abraham Lincoln, the politician widely celebrated for leading the charge for the emancipation of slaves, started off as a moderate.
It's only because of individuals of conviction taking a principled stance, an idealistic stance, over a compromising one, that we have many of the rights that we have today.

But I'm not talking about Abraham Lincoln or anything to do with slavery. In fact, modern day wage slavery in workshops in Asia and Africa are all done on a monetary basis, ie: part of capitalism. Being libertarian and being socialist are both extreme views, but that's not what we're discussing right now. We're looking at which side is more enlightened (and practical).

&gt; Freedom isn't free.

Cute little sentence. We're all aware of the practical limitations that having certain rights and privileges bring. However if I was given the choice, I would much rather live in a free society than to have personal freedoms. Both would create a system which you are locked into, however one is centered around personal gain and the other is focuses on society as a whole. I'd much rather help people whilst I'm having a high and be supported whilst I'm having a low, than to be left alone with either my success or failure.",0,1351461300,null,0,false,0,c6t25xj,t3_127ozx,t1_c6t25xj,t1_c6t1wd9,null,1430261908,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

So the threat of competition keeps prices down and service at an all-time high. Sounds like good news for the consumers!

As soon as the prices go back up, some enterprising individual will buy a bus and set up a competing service. The threat of competition is always there, looming over the conglomerate's inflated profit margins, awaiting the opportunity to force down prices for the consumer. Loss Leads aside, most businesses attempt to operate at profit wherever possible.

&gt;I'd much rather that their intentions and actions reflected need rather than profit, like a nationalised service would.

The problem with nationalised services is the lack of demand indicators. Planned economies in the past have typically resulted in massive surpluses and shortages because predicting supply and demand is incredibly difficult. The 'invisible hand' of the market has been far more capable of efficiently allocating resources than any centrally planned economy has been to date.

You would do well to remember that government is comprised of individuals, individuals who are motivated by profit and career progression to the same extent as individuals in the private sector. While the stated goals of a government body may reflect consumer demand, those involved in the provision of the services, are involved because they get paid. Their motivation is no different to those involved in the private sector.

true,NervousEnergy,eng-yorkshire,Welshman in Yorkshire,"&gt; So the threat of competition keeps prices down and service at an all-time high. Sounds like good news for the consumers!
As soon as the prices go back up, some enterprising individual will buy a bus and set up a competing service. The threat of competition is always there, looming over the conglomerate's inflated profit margins, awaiting the opportunity to force down prices for the consumer. Loss Leads aside, most businesses attempt to operate at profit wherever possible.

But *First-Arriva-Stage-Veola-Transdev* aren't in the business of keeping their customers happy. They're in the business of ousting competition. If they are alone in the market, then they can operate at all the profit they desire. If another competitor arrives on the scene, then they use their critical mass to start a competition of who will go bankrupt first. I'd wager that the smaller company folds first. Even if another giant came along, they would probably be smart enough to decide which company monopolises which lines, so you're just left with multiple monopolies but no choice. If you're going to be left with a monopoly, then it might as well be run for the benefit of the people.

&gt; The problem with nationalised services is the lack of demand indicators. Planned economies in the past have typically resulted in massive surpluses and shortages because predicting supply and demand is incredibly difficult. The 'invisible hand' of the market has been far more capable of efficiently allocating resources than any centrally planned economy has been to date.

I'm not planning an entire economy, I'm just stating on who I would like to own a monopoly and why. Big markets and non-essential services can be left to pure capitalism, sure, but some things are better nationalised.

&gt; You would do well to remember that government is comprised of individuals, individuals who are motivated by profit and career progression to the same extent as individuals in the private sector. While the stated goals of a government body may reflect consumer demand, those involved in the provision of the services, are involved because they get paid. Their motivation is no different to those involved in the private sector.

Personally, I have found that myself and my co-workers take a lot of pride in what we do because we know that we work for the people. Whilst there's no doubt that there are some people who are motivated entirely by personal gain, you have said that this is just like the private sector. If you believe that there's no difference, why are you against monopolies being handled by the government?

true,jihangir,null,null,"&gt;Its all part of the package. Everything in life has its good side and bad sides. If you really are against these policies, then change it. Your apathy and grass-is-greener syndrome isn't the answer, its just noise.

If TalkTalk suddenly started offering war crimes as part of their Broadband Package I'm sure it would raise a few eyebrows.

I'm nowhere as politically active as I'd like to be, because I have people to support and a demanding job, but I'm trying to change these policies by reaching out to people. Having this discussion with you, someone who's obviously intelligent and capable of critically thinking, is one way of doing it. If, at some point in your life, you ever question the role of government, or the morality of taxation, then this discussion has been a personal success for me. I realise it's possibly a few hundred years before a civilised voluntaryist society will emerge, but I'm in it for the long run.

&gt;modern day wage slavery in workshops in Asia and Africa are all done on a monetary basis, ie: part of capitalism.

Heh, I mentioned earlier that I've just came back from India. I'm an engineer, and as part of my job I visited mines and steel mills in some of the most impoverished parts of rural India. While there, I  worked along side many modern day wage slaves, and shared lunch with them. Some of the people I met were working 40 hour weeks for about £120 a month, yet they were happy for the job, because the alternative was starvation and poverty. From our perspective as decadent Westerners we see their employers as exploiters. From the perspective of the workers, their employers are providers and life-savers. That £120 allows them to have a roof over their head, and food for their family. When adjusted for the greatly reduced living cost of India (About 5x cheaper than the UK) they have the same purchasing power as someone earning £4.28 an hour. Nothing to write home about, but enough to make phrases like 'wage slavery' seem redundant.

&gt;I'd much rather help people whilst I'm having a high and be supported whilst I'm having a low, than to be left alone with either my success or failure.

I feel exactly the same way, but I'd rather the support I receive while I'm having a low be given freely than taken by force. Conversely, I'd rather support people freely than have my support taken from me and given by force. It's not a socialist position, it's a humanitarian position.

The beauty of a voluntary society is that nobody can stop you if you and a bunch of friends want to start your own government. You and your friends are free to subjugate yourselves to whatever extent you feel is necessary, and live completely communally if you so choose. All that people like me would ask, is that you don't attempt to subjugate our rights without our consent.

They're competing with all the car manufacturers, all the bicycle makers. The rail companies, the light aircraft manufacturers, the jet-pack retailers, the Star Trek-esque transporter sellers.

true,NervousEnergy,eng-yorkshire,Welshman in Yorkshire,"&gt; If TalkTalk suddenly started offering war crimes as part of their Broadband Package I'm sure it would raise a few eyebrows.

Just stop it with the crap analogies. Again, you're creating noise. Outside of the Military-Industrial-Complex, nobody offers war crimes, nor would they ever like to be seen as offering war crimes. Yes, we have governments doing terrible things in the same way that we have companies doing terrible things, but that still doesn't invalidate what good they create.

&gt; I'm nowhere as politically active as I'd like to be, because I have people to support and a demanding job, but I'm trying to change these policies by reaching out to people. Having this discussion with you, someone who's obviously intelligent and capable of critically thinking, is one way of doing it. If, at some point in your life, you ever question the role of government, or the morality of taxation, then this discussion has been a personal success for me. I realise it's possibly a few hundred years before a civilised voluntaryist society will emerge, but I'm in it for the long run.

I wish that I could say that I was arguing for any particular cause, but I'm just not like that. I know that you can't commit to a policy for everything, it would just be far too inflexible. In the case of vital services and monopolies, my particular preference would be for those services to be nationalised, just like how I would like non-essential goods and services to remain in the private sector.

Plus, we all know that you started your crusade by being brash, facetious, and pedantic.

&gt; Heh, I mentioned earlier that I've just came back from India. I'm an engineer, and as part of my job I visited mines and steel mills in some of the most impoverished parts of rural India. While there, I worked along side many modern day wage slaves, and shared lunch with them. Some of the people I met were working 40 hour weeks for about £120 a month, yet they were happy for the job, because the alternative was starvation and poverty. From our perspective as decadent Westerners we see their employers as exploiters. From the perspective of the workers, their employers are providers and life-savers. That £120 allows them to have a roof over their head, and food for their family. When adjusted for the greatly reduced living cost of India (About 5x cheaper than the UK) they have the same purchasing power as someone earning £4.28 an hour. Nothing to write home about, but enough to make phrases like 'wage slavery' seem redundant.

I'm glad that those workers feel empowered and that they are not being taken advantage of. The benevolence of your company does somewhat encompass some socialist ideals, and I suppose that in lieu of a strong governmental presence, they have filled the void. However, I would not trust every company to do the same, because that's not their fundamental mandate. The loyalty the company is giving to its workers is, unfortunately, entirely optional.

&gt; I feel exactly the same way, but I'd rather the support I receive while I'm having a low be given freely than taken by force. Conversely, I'd rather support people freely than have my support taken from me and given by force. It's not a socialist position, it's a humanitarian position.

I'm fine with paying taxes, I'm not against it. Just like you I do get upset at times over how its spent, but by and large I am not upset that it exists. I prefer it like this, and I'm sure that the vast majority of people find this arrangement agreeable. The flaws are certainly not in taxation, but rather in expenditure. Please use your time to campaign about that, instead of wasting your time with me.

&gt; The beauty of a voluntary society is that nobody can stop you if you and a bunch of friends want to start your own government. You and your friends are free to subjugate yourselves to whatever extent you feel is necessary, and live completely communally if you so choose. All that people like me would ask, is that you don't attempt to subjugate our rights without our consent.

And the ugly side is that there are people who will not pull their weight and that will impact negatively on the people who need help.

true,NervousEnergy,eng-yorkshire,Welshman in Yorkshire,"&gt; The problem is that they aren't just competing with other bus companies. They're competing with every other form of transportation. They're competing with all the car manufacturers, all the bicycle makers. The rail companies, the light aircraft manufacturers, the jet-pack retailers, the Star Trek-esque transporter sellers. In order to completely monopolise the Beesley - Ayeston route, First-Arriva-Stage-Veola-Transdev would have to dominate trillions of pounds worth of markets, and operate in all of them at a loss. Possible? Yes. But incredibly unlikely.
Unlikely that is, unless the government helps them. ;)

The market is people who want to get from Beesley to Ayeston, the core of which are people who through preference or finances need to take a form of public transport. This market is far too small for a new train line, two new airports, or anything like that. It can only sustain a bus service given by one provider. That is what's at stake here. Your muddying the issue by adding in things which bares no or little relevent to either our argument or reality.

&gt; s/economy/industry

An economy is made up of several industries. Therefore, economy ≠ industry.

&gt; Do you consider food to be a 'non-essential' product? It is, after all, more required for life than public libraries, swimming pools and schools. Why is such an important thing left in the hands of the private sector?

Food comes under ""big markets"". There is enough demand for a proper competitive market to be formed, with all the benefits that brings. If this was in jeopardy, then I would be in favour of a more socialist scheme, such as the 40's rationing and the 60's Common Agricultural Policy. In its current status however, it serves both people and businesses well, so I wouldn't shoe-in any ill thought out ideology.

&gt; So would you do your job for free?

No. Which is why I wouldn't expect a charity with their volunteers to pick up the slack, but I have a tremendous respect for those who do. As for the compensation I get for my job, I am completely fine in revealing that I get paid £2.65. Interoperate that as you wish.

&gt; I'm against all monopolies. Free markets result in less monopolies than government regulated ones.

But monopolies will form because there are situations in which it makes sense for a monopoly for form. In those reality-based situations, I would much rather they be controlled by a largely benevolent force.

I wanted to give Glenn a hug. Loved how he just didn't care and how that sweetly lead to his resignation and speech to all the people at Dosac. The stuff on morality really hit me hard.

This must be pursued and if this is true (I can't believe for a second we'd make the statement if it was in doubt, recent events considered) then Clattenburg needs to be nailed to a wall. The FA can't possibly try to help a man who's cast so much controversy over a showpiece fixture and the allegations are surpassed in severity only by those of match-fixing

To put another spin on this, Chelsea need to make the step up and get closer to Man Utd levels of referee intimidation. We all know you don't get decisions at Old Trafford and frankly, it's pretty fucking useful. This situation might create a lot of fear towards giving decisions against us/not giving them for us and I'm fine with that. It also shines a light on how our players are being punished for diving or not being given a free kick or penalty for being fouled

Anyway, hope the club throws every gram of weight behind this and unleash the Buck.

I'm going to have this rant at every 'Last centurion' costume I see.

If you want to do 'The Last Centurion'

You have to look like, guess what? A centurion. Not just a generic roman soldier costume from your local party store. 

See the costume from the show: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ltbdp7JEPm1qlpnp5o1_500.jpg

It varies slightly from episode to episode but you get the idea. A breast plate, gauntlets, and a cloth undergarment with a leather 'skirt', I'm not too familiar with terms for armour, apologies to those that are. 

I mean, I could put together a budget version of the actual costume for about £20, it would have crappy plastic armour but it'd look the part.

You, sadly do not. The tally marks are a nice attempt but please point out to me where in the season 6 opening two parter, where Rory is dressed up as a centurion? 

You're dressing up as a character dressing up as a centurion. That's just you dressing up in a cheap roman soldier costume. 

Sorry to be a party pooper, but it pisses me off when people don't put in the effort and shove some tally marks on their face to say 'HEY I'M FROM DOCTOR WHO'.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; By the christmas period, I think we are going to be looking like a totally different team and when we get our striker in january, look out.

At first I thought this was a bit of an exaggeration, so I thought about what major changes we could see to the team before January. As far as I can think, there's 3:

- Lucas is the big one, and if Rodgers does switch back to a more attacking midfield 3 (which will basically allow Gerrard to attack more; right now he's playing as a holding midfielder with a bit more license to get forward) without compromising defensive solidity, then great. This is probably the biggest factor.

- Assaidi breaking into the first-team for the Premier League, probably at Suso's expense. Nothing against Suso, but I daresay a fully fit Assaidi would offer more than Suso at the moment. This, coupled with Lucas returning, could give us more attacking impetus.

- Resolving the fullback positions - this basically comes down to whether Rodgers thinks Enrique-Johnson is a better pairing than Johnson-Wisdom, and honestly I'm skeptical. I'm inclined to think this won't be a significant factor.

But even if those three happen, I don't think it will turn us into a top 4 side; it should merely prevent us from finishing as low as we did last season. Yes, we've made progress, but our competitors have made as much, if not more, progress in the same amount of time - Chelsea and United are certainties for 2 of the top 4, and even if City have been slightly shaky this season, they're getting results and should be guaranteed a spot. Spurs have begun to gel under AVB, Arsenal were impressive until this recent rough patch, and Everton are viable contenders (though I doubt Newcastle can sustain a challenge for top 4).",0,1351478405,null,0,false,0,c6t6d10,t3_128srr,t1_c6t6d10,t1_c6t57ws,null,1430263879,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

It's a foul. But I don't think it warrants a red. I think people are totally losing the concept of red cards which really were put into the game to get players who were playing dangerous and cheating out of the game. What happened here isn't a ""tackle by the last defender"". Ivanovic never makes a challenge and you can't call it a professional foul as there is no intent there to change the course of the play. All it is is an unfortunate tangling of legs. Seems extremely harsh to remove a player from the game, and give the other team a HUGE advantage because of an unlucky and non deliberate incident.


The counter arguement is that this could mean that players exploit it. But that's why you have referees. It is clear that Ivanovic is tryihng to avoid his feet and get out of the way, rather than slyly trip up Young.

Tim Cahill leaving has let Moyes use Fellaini in his most effective role, Pienaar and Baines are one of the best left flanks in the league, and Jelavic and Mirallas are both good additions. Plus, having started this well, who knows what they'll do when they're *supposed* to surge in the second half of the season?

I think this is the biggest factor here. Lucas should be able to completely change the face of our squad and allow Gerrard to attack more.

Clearly goal-scoring is an issue with the squad and if you assume that Suarez will keep doing what he does, Lucas allows Gerrard to attack more, and - hopefully - a youngster like Shelvey or Suso or Sterling emerges as a goal-scoring threat ... then that just leaves a player like Fabio Borini to also do what he was signed to do.

As for the new striker, I *really* hope it's a centre-forward, rather than a wide man, because I maintain that Suarez's best position is as an 'inside forward' or second striker, but certainly not a centre-forward. If you look at the types of goals he scores, the most frequent ones are those at an angle from the flanks (the Baines own-goal last night, for example), or from outside the box (Norwich), with many of his efforts inside the box in a more central area coming from set pieces. 

I'd like to see us bring in someone with a bit of physicality, who can provide good movement and link-up play, and basically be a ""Danny Graham"" to Suarez's ""Scott Sinclair"", if you'll excuse the constant use of Swansea stereotypes.

Over a forty/fifty year period, climate change will lead to minimal temperature changes here, could even be up or down, but high enough temperatures elsewhere and enough shifting of rainfall patterns to lead to serious widespread hunger in the poorer parts of the world, and there will be famines and wars in Africa, although by that stage most countries there will be significantly more developed, and more able to withstand such shocks. A lot of our food supply will be grown indoors, hydroponically, and the rest we'll just be able to outbid other countries for. Energy will probably be about 40% nuclear, 20% wind, 10% various other renewables, and the rest gas from shale fields. 

The culture will still be relatively similar, with interesting figures doing world-recognized work in science, literature and so on, and then the mass of people doing terribly boring work in call centres or offices. I think we'll see even more of an emergence of a global class of citizens, smooth-faced multilingual people who zip around from one country to another, and London will continue to be a global capital for this class of people. I think we'll opt out from a federalizing Europe, but will have stronger cultural and economic links than we do now; Europe will have informally adopted English as its Lingua Franca, and it will be quite common for British people to live and work on the continent.

And there I peter out.

Edit: Oh, also, I think we'll see elements of emergence of world government. Probably to some extent in terms of mysterious men with sharp suits and sunglasses, but also agreements to handle taxes between countries.

Here's the gist of it. Torres has a high-boot but it is a 50/50 challenge because Cleverley isn't in full control of the ball - he's merely chested it. And Torres does get the ball but hits Cleverley in the chest in the process. Both players seem okay about it afterward, they even shake hands and even entertaining-Evra seems to be okay with the yellow.

Hmmm, how do you interpret this one? Torres got the ball, so the tackle was valid. But he went in with a high boot and hence yellow? Because there have been challenges where people have been injured but since the challenge was won, no player was fouled or even carded. I can think of the challenge on Ashley Cole against Swansea last year as one example..

Piazon has looked like great quality whenever he has played and his understanding with our coterie of brazilians is something I would like to see us utilise more.

As a disclaimer, I'm not saying Romeu is as good as or the same as Makalele, but he shields the back four in a similar manner and it's a great asset to have someone playing that role.

Evidence?

It really depends where you live. Some areas have 20 jobseekers to each vacancy. 

http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2087775/20-jobseekers-vacancy-areas-worst-hit-unemployment-says-IPPR.html

&gt;The IPPR said that the worst-hit area was West Dunbartonshire with 20 jobseekers per vacancy, followed by Clackmannanshire on 19 and then East Ayrshire, Hartlepool, Blaenau Gwent, Lewisham, North Ayrshire, the Isle of Wight and Gravesham, all on 16.
&gt;
&gt;In contrast, some areas had only one or even no jobseekers for vacancies, including Crawley, Cambridge, South Buckinghamshire, North Warwickshire, Daventry and the City of London.

And as anecdotal evidence;

My 19 yo cousin has been jobseeking for 18 months. He has A-Levels and some Microsoft server admin qualifications. He's smart, well presented and friendly. He kept a spreadsheet of all the jobs he applied for in this period - there were approximately 1000 on there. He was applying for everything from call centre work and cleaning, up to entry level helpdesk stuff.

Match ruined and what should have been a critical pointer to the season ahead and our squads growth has turned into a controversy fest.

I made a point earlier in the season that we are not the finished article yet. The first 25 minutes of the match confirms that. What is fantastic to see is the way that despite making mistakes/conceding goals that would put other teams out and players heads down, there is a belief and a willingness to just keep going that is digging us out at critical points.

Even with ten men I think that united would have felt themselves lucky to get a draw, and at times with nine we were a gnats whisker away from something out of nothing.

I won't argue the Ivanovic red, it happens. Torres red and the offside goal were a joke, and the crowd were rightfully incensed. 

I'm in two minds about the complaint - obviously Mikel is unhappy, and the FA statement about protecting those who come forward should come into play, but the timing is awful given where we are. 
The general public will think it is sour grapes, and the FA I am sure will want to protect it's referees and their position. I have a feeling we are on a hiding to nothing.

The cup game is not important, other than to give some of the fringe players some time. It's a shame that such a crucial match was spoiled, but there is a lot to take away that is positive.

In this situation, I really do see the two powers pushing liberal western nations as far as they can in taking control of disputed lands - and using the threat of their nuclear arsenal to deter interference.

Sadly, for smaller countries in the peripheries of these two petulant giants to remain safe will need the UK (and Nato allies) to retain their nuclear arsenal as the final sanction in a deterrent against such expansionist plans.

As I said earlier (on my other, now retired account because I can't remember a fucking password), you can't say you're playing the best football when you can't shoot and score, because that's part of playing football.

And even beyond that, I don't think our football is as good as that of United, Chelsea or Spurs, and especially in the case of Chelsea it's silly to suggest otherwise. What we do have is a respectable balance between attack and defense, but that that doesn't mean we have the best offensive and defensive play in the league, just that one aspect isn't outweighing the other noticeably. And in United's case especially, the defensive issues are temporary until their injuries come to an end.

If a deterrent relies in this possibility it is a bit of a gamble isn't it ?

The reason we face a wave of guerilla threats is because we are not divided by the lines on a map anymore. The EU is a perfect demonstration of this. The ease with which you can move to Germany and get a job shows how much has changed in 70 years.

Most governments are reasonable and stable by comparison to 70 years ago, and those that are not are either being suppressed by western intervention (Iraq, Afganistan, Libya), in a state of revolution or near-revolution (Sudan, Most of the middle east) or completely unsustainable (NK, Somalia, Zimbabwe).

These are not nations about to declare war on the world, those with the power to start a world war have no motivation, the cost of military action is far greater than the potential gain, even without Nuclear weapons, as can be seen in current middle eastern conflicts. (We can't even ""conquer"" a 3rd world desert nation, how will we invade China?)

Therefore the only source of unrest are smaller less organised extremists. Iraq and Afganistan have pretty clearly demonstrated how warfare has changed. You can't nuke the Al Qaeda. You can't nuke Robert Mugabe, and you can't nuke Gadhaffi.",0,1351510596,null,0,false,0,c6tb4nl,t3_129ncs,t1_c6tb4nl,t1_c6tay7p,null,1430266203,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I expect next season we'll start wth a new central striker with Suarez and Sterling as the WFs and Borini in the squad.  Suso will move back into the midfield and get time as the most advanced of the three.  If we can retain Sahin we'll have good depth in midfield but probably want to sign one more true DM for the squad because it looks like BR doesn't think Henderson is destined for that position like I thought he would be.

In defense it looks like Wisdom has moved ahead of Flanagan and is probably level with Kelly in the depth chart.  It will be interesting to see if either of them move inside as Coates is still struggling, in my opinion.  Skrtel and Agger are locked in and Johnson looks like the best FB in the league.  Enrique has played well this week but, unless Robinson takes a big step forward, we'll need another LB.

Our goalkeeping situation is troubling but that should get sorted out.  That means we're basically looking to fill three spots (CF, DM, LB) plus sign Sahin and sell on a few players who haven't cut it.  If we can do that, we'll have a much stronger, deeper team with a year of playing in a defined system to build from.

Secondly, you don't have to attack with nuclear weapons to benefit from having them. They're a last minute suicide for everyone button you press if you're fucked. That encourages people not to fuck you.

So will Russia nuke states in Europe? Fuck no it won't. But it having nukes will sure as hell make every other country not want to intervene if one day Russia decides to go for a land grab against non nuclear states.

Example scenario. 

We disarm. 

Russia rolls into the UK (Ridiculous premise.)..

Our biggest allies are France and the US in such a situation as they have nukes. What do they do? Do they risk going to war with another nuclear power? Fuck no they don't. 

So we get steam rolled because none of our allies want to intervene due to the threat of nuclear war. 

Russia vs a non nuclear state isn't a nuclear threat so it's not a world problem.

For example - plans by a future China to invade Taiwan would be thwarted if it knew that the UK had three nuclear armed submarines off its coast.

One of the things you have to remember about nuclear weapons is that basically they are just easily deliverable high-ordnance. The nuclear weapon is not in of itself significantly different from firing a few million tons of TNT at something.

It's just a lot easier to fire one nuclear missile than hundreds of ballistic conventional missiles. Easier, but not impossible.

For example, it is well known than North Korea could flatten Seoul, with conventional weapons. Its test nuclear weapon was thought to be the size of a truck - which means it wasn't deliverable in any means useful to a military operation.

So if we all have nukes, and use them to exert our power, that improves things?

&gt;Do you understand the crappy logic in that statement?

I'm not exerting that it is perfect logic, just that I think these changes are one-way, not a reversible change, the political entropy is increasing so to speak.

I am not disputing that someone is not going to want to invade the UK because we have nukes, I am disputing the premise.

1. Nobody wants to invade the UK
2. Even if they did, having nuclear weapons wouldn't physically stop them, as the ""Yes, Prime minister"" clip points out.
3. Suppose the entire world was disarmed, there is STILL no reason any disarmed state would have to invade any other disarmed state. The economic impact would be terrible due to the (now) global nature of trade and economy.

There is no resource that Russia could have that currently makes it a good target for invasion when weighed against the negative impact of actually having to go to war.

Suddenly Russia discovers it has found an oilfield that doubles the worlds oil resources. Invade Russia? No, it's cheaper to just buy it, it benefits both sides.

I agree eventually we may run out of resources and end up fighting over scraps, but using Nuclear weapons is suicide for EVERYONE, what does it matter to us if we kill an extra 25 million people in Russia a few years earlier than Nuclear winter and the collapsed state will?

If the concern REALLY was fear of being nuked, that £15bn would be spent on R&amp;D for taking out ICBMs and SLBMs.

The only reason I can think of keeping nuclear weapons is that people still think like you do, and therefore the perception has value, even if it actually has no direct defence applications.",0,1351513908,null,0,false,0,c6tbjax,t3_129ncs,t1_c6tbjax,t1_c6tbdcp,null,1430266400,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Of course - because that was the question you asked. If you meant something different, then you should have said so.

&gt;  I'm asking why the UK having them would be different? We'd be similarly annihilated if we used nukes against China, so surely by the same logic as the US attacking Pakistan China or Russia could attack us, regardless of whether we had weapons?

Ahh.

Well, the UK being attacked directly would trigger Nato article 5, which would result in retaliation by all Nato members - so Russia would be flattened by the counter-strike.

Also worth noting that the UK arsenal is sufficient to flatten all major cities in Russia on its own, so Russia attacking the UK would be suicide for the Russian government.

Anyway, as all such debates are theoretical, if the UK were to act unilaterally withouth Nato support in offering suzerainty to another country, the UK arsenal on its own is deliverable to Asia in a manner than none of the Asian powers could retaliate against.

The UK could flatten every major city in China - and China cannot respond in kind. At least not yet.

What could be possible in the future is unknown - which is one of the reasons why long term strategic weapons should be retained, in case our grandchildren need them.

China in the future might be a liberal democracy, or an aggressive state with blue-water capabilities and on the verge of war with Japan, Taiwan and India.

Problem is, the credit bubble got so big that it would take most big banks down. It's the whole too-big-to-fail dilemma - the powers that be took the decision to backstop massive bank losses with public money. 

Deflation is being countered with deliberate inflationary policies (i.e. quantitative easing), asset prices are being propped up, but wages are stagnating and services are being cut.

You have to build a community to a big enough level to be able to sustain a league before you have one. Just look at NUEL and how that has made a rapid departure from e-sports competition. Look at UKDota and how the in-house league has stopped. You need to build a community before you can have a competition.

Why? The problem you'll face in a small league is that one team will absolutely dominate every league/tournament there is. All the other teams will drop out because they have no chance of winning, and you've immediately killed your league before it really even got going.

You also need to build a community so teams actually care that it's a university league. Why do you want to face off against university teams when you can play in huge leagues with lots of different teams of all skills?

Lastly, you need to advertise to get all students from a university involved and for them to actually be university teams. Too much of this suffers from X friends playing together who go to the same university, which isn't really the best the university has to offer, it's just a bunch of friends playing under the university banner when they could easily go play in other leagues.",0,1351514866,null,0,false,0,c6tboli,t3_125oqa,t1_c6tboli,t3_125oqa,null,1430266467,5,false,UKDota,t5_2uyoj,5

* Inflation up to about 20%
* OPEC oil stoppage
* Fuel shortages causing the country to go on to a ""three day week"", i.e we couldn't afford to heat and light offices and industry.
* Electricity blackouts.
* The country ran out of money and had to go to the IMF to borrow - we were not far off the situation Greece is in now.

Having said all that, life went on, and in most ways it was a nice period to grow up.

Could it get that bad? No, I don't think so. Places like Argentina have gone through economic collapse and none of them ended up that bad. Also all of them had fundamental economic problems which we don't have. Let's say our banking sector disappears overnight - that would be catastrophic for somewhere like Switzerland, but survivable for the UK, because we do things like Making Stuff (surprising, but our manufacturing sector is still one of the biggest).

But let's say things go seriously pear-shaped and the whole economy is somehow knocked out so that we get back to that stage.

Haven't seen much discussion about the foul on Distin. Can't find a gif of it at the moment - I'm sure someone could provide one.  It was certainly a nasty one and could have warranted a red card (you've seen them given in the past), especially if it was intentional. However I don't think it was meant, I remember from the time it just looked like Suarez had miss-timed his stepping. Then again I guess I'm bias and will always try to defend our players. What do you guys think? Intential by Suarez? Should he have been sent off for it?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Nope, although we would be higher up than we are now, definitely.

That table is completely subjective. It goes on whatever the author thinks is a debatable decision. We've had far more than 6 debatable decisions. And remember, the decisions don't just change the scoreline, they change the whole mentality of the players and therefore the outcome of the match.

&gt; And even beyond that, I don't think our football is as good as that of United, Chelsea or Spurs, and especially in the case of Chelsea it's silly to suggest otherwise.

Against United, we were the better team. No doubt about it. They've got a very good squad. They may be the better team in terms of players, but we were and are the far more technically advanced team, with better tactics and playing style. We should've won that game, and were incredibly unlucky not to.

Chelsea, ok, they're playing really well under Di Matteo, but let me put it to you another way - remove Mata, and they're nothing. They lose half their goals, and they're pretty screwed with few attacking options (ok Torres is improving, and Sturridge is decent, but nowhere near Mata). Surely that's not so dissimilar to Lucas? Without Lucas, our midfield, whilst decent, is not nearly as effective. Because he allows Gerrard to attack more and have more freedom in general. It's the same with Mata. He is the key player for Chelsea. Without him, they would not be top of the table.

&gt;  I don't see what makes Chelsea or Spurs any less promising than us, given the number of good younger players they've got as well.

Chelsea's young players are in their 20s (21-24). Whereas ours, Sterling, Suso, Wisdom etc. are all in their teens. That's quite a big gap for a footballer. Their players are generally getting to the age where they can't really develop much more, whereas ours still have at least 2-3 years. Obviously, players keep developing throughout their career, but I mean by the time you're 22/23/24/25 you're at your physical &amp; mental peak as a player. 

Tottenham again most of their young players are into their 20s (generally, looking at their squad, 23). There's a huge difference between a ""young"" player, as in a player who is just breaking into the squad in their early 20s, and a genuinely young player, who is playing at a world class standard in their teens.


Obviously, we can't rely on Lucas for our title challenge. We do need a good finisher and we do need some general improvement in all areas (Reina has been far from his best this season, we need a new fullback or two, a decent back-up for Lucas and a finisher), but as a long-time football and Liverpool follower, I'm being 100% honest when I say this is the first time in a good 5-6 years that I genuinely believe we can win the league in the near future.",0,1351516666,null,0,false,0,c6tbzuy,t3_128srr,t1_c6tbzuy,t1_c6taqu6,null,1430266610,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Reducing the amount of investment in the public sector reduces the national debt, but has the knock-on effect of reducing the income of those businesses that rely on those contracts. It also reduces the quality of life for many people dependent on the services that are cut. This causes a big problem for national morale because everyone sees everything getting steadily worse while costs rise endlessly.

Quantitative easing causes inflation which is great for paying off debts and making our exports attractive (our pound becomes worth less over time) but it takes a lot of effort to undo that inflation. This drives the base costs of goods up, as does the ratcheting increase in the cost of energy. We are competing with many other first-world nations for access to the fossil fuels that power our economy. Our particular location is favourable to sustainable energy because we can tap tidal and offshore wind power sources (on-shore wind farms are not as efficient, and solar is limited to daylight hours). These energy sources are variable and we need on-demand solutions. I hate to say it, but nuclear power (for all its bad press) offers a much better prospect and we should be looking closely at thorium for a solution here.

All these costs going up will not be matched by an increase in wages because these represent operating costs to the businesses. Thus access to energy intensive resources (like private cars) will become much more expensive. People will therefore start to abandon private car ownership and rely on efficient car rental solutions or mass transit where practical. Because mass transit is in such a poor state generally, there will be a strong push for safe cycle paths, but mainly people will seek to travel less. 

Thus jobs will become more localised, with people using the internet a lot more to earn income. Employers will simply take advantage of long-existing technology to allow office workers to work from home. The competition for these kinds of jobs will probably drive further reduced wages and/or reduced hours, so that people will be forced to take on multiple jobs simply to earn enough. They may even find themselves in globally competitive market for their role. Amazon's Mechanical Turk could be the friend to many.

To counter this global market, people may react by offering goods and services that only they are able to provide - perhaps through creative works or knowledge. After all, many office jobs are simple enough for anyone to do, but not many people can write great music or have deep knowledge about a difficult subject. 

The Internet favours collaboration, and facilitates direct contact, so I would expect to see people trading directly with each other. In the first instance this would be through PayPal and banks, but perhaps later on people would seek to cut out the middlemen and use technologies like Bitcoin instead. In the face of rising costs for everything, any way to improve margins will be sought.

For Utd:  
Hernandez offside

Luiz handball in box  
Cahill drags Evra down with both arms in box

I don't see what you guys really have to complain about. At the very worst, United got an offside goal and you got away with a penalty kick offense. Seems to break even. Both red cards were ultimately justified, the first because it was a legitimate red card offense and the second because he should have been sent off twenty minutes earlier.

Think of Afghanistan, what was our purpose of invading? Was it to conquer? No, those kind of wars don't exist anymore.

Wars now are either civil or peacekeeping, All of the nations with the military power to invade are stable enough to not need to. Can you ever conceive of any country in the EU engaging in a war with Russia, China, US?

I don't see it happening, but I can see a small extremist group of ideologists like Al Qaeda or the Taliban causing problems. 

As ridiculously over-the-top CoD is, it has some interesting points about the changing face of war. The storyline of a group of ultra nationalist Russians obtaining access to nukes, making a terrorist attack look like an act of war and a rogue SAS captain sending a retaliation (all of which are ludicrous) seem to be making a point that the power to destroy can come down to a few unstable individuals.

You can declare war on a nation, but how can you declare war on an extremist position? ""War on &lt;noun&gt;""s are not very successful.

The cost of war on a nation vs nation scale is so much higher now than ever before in history, nations actually have more to lose than to gain.

The Falklands is a pretty good example of the kind of thing that would happen if any country were desperate enough to try and go to war with any of the largest economic powers.

There are good reasons why ad-hock agreements in the bedroom are not granted automatic legal protection, and while the donor was under the impression that the children had financial security, he should have been aware that he had no legal protection against future claims whatsoever.

The actual battle, I believe was between demonstrators and the police trying to keep public order, but I think you are right in saying it signalled the end of the Mosley fascist movement.

Also Interesting - on the same page on youtube is a link to another video on Nick Griffin appearing on Question Time.  This exposed his ridiculous ideas to scrutiny and mockery, and I guess the point I'm making is that form of combat is ultimately more effective than violence.

I attended an 'anti EDL' demo a few months back on St Georges day just to document what happened by taking photos.  It turned out that no actual EDL members turned up, it was just a St. Georges march with no offensive banners or chanting, they were just carrying English flags and a couple of dragons they'd made.

But the assembled crowd took no notice of this.  They'd come prepared for an anti-fascist demo and that's what they were going to do.  Screaming insults, throwing fireworks at the bewildered marchers, I ended up having nothing but contempt for the way a hard core of the 'anti fascists' were behaving.

This is what happens when you get an angry crowd together and it really is very very ugly.


EDIT: reading back it might look like I think you're advocating violence - which is not the case.  Just wanted to make sure you understood :)

In my area, a 20/25 year mortgage on a 3 bed terrace split into two flats is about £900/£1000 pcm. Rent on each flat is about £450. So in a good month, you cover your mortgage. On top of this, you have insurance, repairs and running costs, as well as the personal time spent doing jobs and making sure the places aren't empty, all because they want a good pension so that their kids will have something when their parents die.

Another problem is housing benefits, getting money from councils is like getting blood from a stone, especially when the tenants aren't exactly playing ball.

I meet so many people like you. ""oh you own houses you must be rich."" - That is incredibly ignorant, it's a fine line between profit and loss, and you often have to subsidize the losses out of your own wages earned working your own job.

In that position, it's a penalty. That cannot be disputed. As for Torres, he clearly chose to fall down in order to try and get a penalty kick. He didn't get knocked over, he went down. There was the slightest of contact and that means the decision can be questioned, but since he chose to go down in order to make a meal of it, you can't claim that the ""foul"" cost him a potential goal. It's also very hard to take your accusation of bias seriously in light of the irrational outcry going on around here. The decisions were literally even. They were *objectively* even: Chelsea deserved to have two players sent off, United got an offside goal and did not get a penalty that should have been. No other decisions were gamechanging. Those were the only ones that really affected the outcome, and both sides got equal shares in the end.

I would agree with that. But I think regardless of where Suarez plays, I think he simply needs someone to help share the burden of scoring with him and that's where the idea of a centre-forward is so important. But there are so many factors that come into play...

* How many players have the - as you mentioned - the physicality, the good movement and link-up play, etc.?
* How many players have the attitude to impress Rodgers?
* Is the player a proven goal-scorer?
* How old is the player?

The rules are not about intent, it's about whether or not a ball is illegally blocked by a part of the body with which one is not allowed to touch the ball. It's entirely possible that it was unintentional, and also entirely irrelevant. Intent only comes into question when the arm was not in an objectionable position. If it is, it doesn't matter what his intent was. It's the defender's responsibility to be mindful of his positioning. It would be completely impossible to judge whether or not it was intentional.

Regarding Torres, I meant free kick. The point all along is that he should have been sent off twenty-four minutes earlier than that. This invalidates any other claim. You can't call it unfair that he didn't get a free kick when he should have been sent off much earlier. The mere fact that you got to have him on the pitch for that long is worth much more than a free kick. I didn't say there shouldn't be a free kick, either -- the line is becoming very blurred and nobody seems to have a definitive answer on whether or not it's perfectly legitimate to dive because you were touched a little. It was most certainly a dive, but there was contact. However, that was not a gamechanging situation apart from the fact that he was sent off, and he should have been sent off much earlier.

Ivanovic clips Young's heels. There is no doubt about the contact, it's literally visible. If you think Torres should have had a free kick, you can't then say that Young shouldn't have had anything. It's entirely possible that he goes down easily, but again, he hits him and he's the last man. I originally called Torres' second yellow card questionable precisely because there was contact, thus it wasn't necessarily the right call, but what overshadows that particular incident is the earlier one where he should have been sent off. In this case, there's no such redeeming factor. Ivanovic makes contact, Young is the last man, you really can't justify Torres' fall and then say the opposite of Young's. I want to point out that basically everyone is calling Ivanovic's red card correct, including many of your club's own fans. I would encourage you to look beyond this subreddit if you want an unbiased view.

It doesn't matter who dominated who. It wouldn't matter if Chelsea had 99% possession and five hundred shots on goal. You need to be less subjective. You need to know the rules if you want to discuss them. You need to stop excusing something when done by your own players but not when done by others.

true,justmots,present,"John Terry  ","It doesn't matter where he was moving his arm?  Your wrong and your argument has just become even more invaluable to you.  According to Fifa 12 law:
&gt;The interpretation of FIFA Law 12 tells referees to consider a few things when determining handball infractions. First, the movement of the hand is considered. If the hand moved to the ball, then the handling of the ball is most likely intentional. But if the ball moved to the hand, it may not be intentional. Second, the distance of the player to the ball is considered. A handball that occurred from a ball played close is unexpected and most likely unintentional. But when a ball is played from far away, a player has time to anticipate the ball and avoid handling it with their arm or hand. Finally, the position of the hand is considered. Touching the ball with an arm that is hanging away from the body is not necessarily an infraction. Once again, the handling of the ball must be intentional.

With that being said, I had just repeated myself because I knew the rules and you apparently didn't agree with the rules but here you go read em with a little bit more care before you make claims of what a handball is and is not.

My situation was resolved, but it took 10 months, and only because of intervention from a local MP and other figures in the UK and the States.  

Never ever trust anything they tell you!  Even if you produce all the necessary documentation, go for interviews and jump through all the hoops, they will refuse entry.  It is part if the process.  What they don't realize is that they cause huge emotional turmoil for people and families. 

It would be different if it was a case if someone trying to enter the UK with falsified documents, or simply trying to get into the country without skills in order to get onto the benefits system, but they treat everyone as potential scroungers/criminals.  

It is difficult for South Africans now to get to the UK.  I have South African friends who hold Phd's that have been turned down.  Some have started the process and have given up, because they keep moving the goal posts.

You think a multinational company would spend hundreds of thousands signing up for a minimum ten year lease and fitting out a coffee shop, and then shut it down in weeks if business was slow?

You are naive about the way in which these markets work. This is not like a single global, highly-liquid market in cars, mobile phones or oil, but every town is its own local, isolated market, often unable to have enough business to support more than one outlet of a particular type. In the current climate, independent retailers find it very set up, because they do not have the huge capital required for the lease and the fit-out, and to wait out the early period of unprofitability, or indeed to choke off large company competition.

Gibraltar is a British overseas territory located near the southernmost tip of the Iberian Peninsula and overlooking the Strait of Gibraltar, sharing a border with Spain to the north. It is part of the EU, having joined the European Economic Community under the United Kingdom in 1973. Article 355(3) (ex Article 299(4)) applies the treaty to ""the European territories for whose external relations a Member State is responsible"", a provision which in practice only applies to Gibraltar. Although it is part of the EU, Gibraltar is outside the customs union and VAT area and is exempted from the Common Agricultural Policy.[35] As a separate jurisdiction to the UK, Gibraltar's government and parliament are responsible for the transposition of EU law into local law.

And pretty much each other response has asked the same question.

&gt;I was more meaning that if Pakistan can't deter the US, how are we supposed to deter the US/China/whoever when we have a similar arsenal?

&gt;Now if they had £2-3 more an hour, thats £75-£112.50 extra a week. Which that person can do something with! Put it back into the economy, save up or even learn something to make them more employable!
  
  
They will lose some of that extra wage by the price inflation that happens as a result. Or they will buy goods from other EU nations with a lower labour cost and therefore lower prices. So the bartender gets a few extra quid every week and so does the worker at the textile company.  Both bar and textile co put their prices up to cover the cost of the wage increase. Next time the bartender needs a new pair of trousers, he's less likely to buy from the British textile co because they are necessarily more expensive than their EU competition. End result is that the textile co goes out of business because they can't compete at the demanded price level, and fewer textile workers have enough money left for beers after their dole cheque is spent.  
Personally, I think any redistribution of wealth should be accomplished through the tax system. Raising the tax-free allowance would be a better way to put money in the hands of minimum wage workers. This would require additional taxation in the upper brackets, or further austerity measures.  
As for education, I think that mature student courses are new prohibitively expensive. OU courses that used to cost ~£180 are now over £400. I think there should be a fund for people who have not had whatever level of education they're studying for, to have it subsidised. Eg if you have a Bachelor's, you could still get a grant towards a Master's. This could be limited to STEM subjects in order to make it more useful to the country as a whole.

To be honest, the Torres challenge looks like a legitimate red, but the intent to actually hurt Cleverly was non-existant, and seemed more like a clumsy late challenge. Usually refs tend not to give red cards if its a clumsy challenge and Torres was definitely trying to get the ball, not end the game for Cleverly.

If Torres however, just steamrolled in with both feet, or didn't even have any intent to get the ball, then a red would most definitely have been the right call.

All in all, most people will see this as a bad challenge and hence a red, but most tend to turn blind eyes to what their own team do as well. I recall Evans going all Roy Keane on Drogba with a retarded challenge and walking away like a complete tool, and subsequently Drogba being booked for getting kicked in the chest..now you won't hear United fans calling for Evans' head for a dirty challenge and even dirtier sportsmanship like that, thats just how football and its fans work. 

Much like how we beat Reading a few weeks back with essentially, a Torres-offside goal, yet we don't go on and on about how we should crucify the linesman for not flagging Torres offside. 

Objectively, the Torres challenge was definitely bad and stupid, and was one of those ""is it a yellow or something worse"" sort of challenges. And IMO, Clattenberg got that one right because of the intent.

Coming down to it, it was a good game before both incidents and it just left a sour taste in our mouths along with the allegations against Clattenberg..I hope this all gets sorted soon.

On a side note: We are still in top form based on the performance, and we should look forward towards more points in the bag rather than looking back and wondering what could have been.

Football is run by an ancient organization that refuses to change their stance on certain things.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ah. 

Making the atmosphere more polluted by flying more isn't a good idea, clearly, ergo building more runways for more flights to happen which will cause more pollution is not a good idea. Since we are likely past the point at which we really need to lower the pollution levels very quickly, making provisions for more airplanes seems totally pointless or suicidal, otherwise. 

Now, since I am a pessimist and I don't think anyone is going to limit the use or airplanes in order to reduce pollution, the next problem is that the price of fossil fuels will likely rise a lot since they are running out so that Canada is being dug up and put in a giant washing machine to try to squeeze some tar out of sand. Once the prices go up, there will be less flights anyway. Until then, sure, we'll have fucked up the atmosphere good and proper but we won't need all those extra runways because most of us won't be able to afford it anyway and will have to make do with holidaying on the Devon tundra. 

To recap - my observation is - since air travel needs to be reduced due to the need to cut pollution and will anyway be reduced due to fuel scarcity around the corner, why bother building more capacity in the airports? It's fucking pointless.

Works fine, as do umpteen online whois tools or the tool provided by one of my domain registrars.

Seriously, I get pretty intimate with nslookup, whois, ping and such but I'm not at the level where I'm that involved in network topology that providing search on domain misses is a problem - nslookups and such are easily recognised by the IP returning from opendns's domain block. For those people who it is a problem then they'll most likely be running their own DNS somewhere anyway.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I made an observation. 

There are two factors that make is seem totally pointless to be thinking about building more capacity for airplanes: The need to reduce pollution and the inevitable rise in the price of fossil fuels. 

Flying causes pollution ergo flying more (by using extra runways) causes more pollution. Cutting pollution is of the essence and if we cut the pollution it's obvious that cutting flying would be part of the deal ergo less need for runways. At the exact time that we should be flying less, proposals are being made to make more flying possible. This is pointless if you hold some slim hope that humanity is not suicidal on a species-wide level. 

Now is the time to make less pollution, including not flying so much. This is uncontroversial, as far as I can see. 

As to the depletion of fossil fuels. Even if there were not a problem with pollution (which there is, clearly) there is immanently going to be a rise in the price of flying that means that people will be doing less of it ergo the need for more airplane capacity will probably be less by the time the planning permission is sorted out. 

Two reasons why (in a sane mind, anyway) making provisions for more flying is pointless. 

We should be making provisions for less flying. 

More flying capacity = pointless due to at least two major factors I can think of. 

Less flying capacity = sensible. 

Increasing flights in the hope some imaginary technology will sort everything out = monumentally stupid (I'm adding that gratuitously, it has nothing to do with my original observation).

What's the problem here?

true,JB_UK,null,null,"You are missing the basic game theory nature of this. Say you have a local cafe which is going along with a small profit each year. A Costa Coffee sets up next door, taking away 25% of the business, rendering the independent cafe unprofitable. This means that in a local market where there is only enough demand for one cafe, the locals overwhelmingly favour the independent business by three to one, but it's only a matter of time until that business will have to shut down. And this is a purely one-way process, no local businessman is every going to take on Costa or Starbucks at the same game and win.

&gt; This is hardly a win for planning restrictions given that the council approved Costa's request..

The planning restrictions do not exist at the moment. Again, you are naive about the way the system works. Do you think that the fact that the council approved the application means they actually favour it? This might be a reasonable interpretation, but unfortunately reality is not like that. Businesses have the right to appeal any decision, and take it to public enquiry. The multinational brings in expensive lawyers and consultants, and if the council loses, they have to pay costs, which might run into hundreds of thousands of pounds. So the council puts at risk taxpayer's money, and their ability to maintain other services, should they choose to dispute a planning request from a multinational. Lose that case, and 
they might have to close a library.

Indeed.  However, his part in history is possibly a little overplayed as people these days seem to be under the misconception that Darwin came up with the entire concept of evolution itself when in reality the concept that life forms can change overtime was well known within the scientific world (see [Jean-Baptiste Lamarck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baptiste_Lamarck)\).  Darwin's big idea was that nature itself was the driving force behind this change, but had he not come up with the concept of natural selection,  someone else by the name of [Alfred Russell Wallace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Russel_Wallace) (A co-publisher of Darwin's scientific paper) would have, and it would be him on the £10 note instead.

Basically, had Darwin or Wallace not published,  natural selection was such a simple concept that we'd have discovered it not too long afterwards anyhow.

true,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,"&gt;As it stands to fuel a fusion reactor you need a material that only releases fuel on the 2nd neutron hit and can survive at the heart of a star, release on the 1st hit and you over fuel and grow the reaction, release on the 3rd and you starve it.

Umm.. what?

The neutrons are used to produce tritium from the lithium blanket but the cross-section of neutrons going into the lithium blanket is already reduced (overfuel really isn't a problem) , there are many complications with fusion but the basic physics of the first wall isn't one of them.

Also it's misleading as you make it sound like we need one material whereas the cells that make up the lithium blanket are a complex instrument entirely separate from the vast majority of the wall which will consist of either Beryllium or Tungsten (likely tungsten in the future) and because of the divertor technology most of the wall doesn't ""have to survive at the heart of the star"" but just the divertor regions which are made of extremely resilient tungsten.

It is possible with our current technology, and given that we can now look at the Stellarator as well as the Tokamak as we have many heating technologies now that render the need for a plasma current obsolete it really does seem like a viable option.

Wind, wave and solar aren't suitable for baseload generation really, I support Fission but it has well-known disadvantages (and for the weird tech like Thorium etc. it's almost as far off as fusion in any case).

To be honest what we need to do is actually __DO__ the stuff, quit messing about and make it a national priority, stop cutting funding to science and instead massively increase it. Make bold plans and stick to them. It worked for the Manhattan Project, it worked for the Apollo Missions and it can work for fusion.

PS: Also meta-materials typically refer to materials that consist of meta-atoms such as those engineered to have negative refractive indices which are used in 'invisibility cloaks' at microwave (and perhaps one day visible) wavelengths.

He could of had 6 goals in his last two appearances and one of them was a 20 minute cameo...that's how good his movement is...also how rough his finishing is atm. At the pace he is currently developing he NEEDS to spend the rest of the year on loan. This is a critical period for him that we should not be messing with. He will come back a much much more polished player, capable of starting for us.

I think the best situation will be to start giving Sturridge more of a shot now that he's healthy...Torres looks far too fatigued. And also to bring in a cheap stop gap poacher in January. Someone like Klose or Huntelaar or Demba Ba. Maybe not those exact guys but you get the idea.

Then there's also the Falcao option. If we are gonna do this... Torres should be going the other way as part of the deal. There is no room for both of them.

true,OhWhyBother,null,null,"I agree with almost all of your points but can't resist adding a few points of my own:

The trouble with remembering a football match is we never retain all 90 minutes of it; we only retain incidents that impacted us as an audience (and potentially impacted the match) more clearly than any of the other bits - our own private highlight reel, so to speak. Obviously, our affiliation provides the bias for the incidents that have higher retention and we are all guilty.

High-boot challenges aren't always legitimate, guaranteed reds although this one does look like a potential candidate - probably because of the immense scrutiny it has come under since. When the ball is above waist height, very few players are actually going to wait until it bounces a few times to knee-level or so. Under such circumstances there have been (and probably will always be) high-boot challenges. Heck, Cleverley himself tried to hoick it away when it was above waist height. His boot could have hit Torres as well, and it did not hit his chest - it hit his arm/elbow. People crucifying Torres are forgetting that it was stupid challenge but it wasn't reckless. 

Then again, it's probably my pro-Blue bias.

Clattenburg had a pretty decent game in the first half. Heck, he even started the second half well and then something, somewhere went horribly wrong. Dunno exactly what or when. 

IMO, when a team is down to 10 men, sending another man off is game-changing - irrespective of whether the player deserved it or not. You have to be absolutely sure that it was a cardable offence before you make a call like that. To do it based merely on suspicion, especially in such a high-pressure game like this one, is akin to pressing the nuclear switch in the Cuban missile crisis. (Okay, maybe that's too much exaggeration but I hope you get the gist.) 

As for the Torres offside goal vs Reading, IIRC this subreddit was in full acknowledgement of the fact after the match. No one deflected any attention away from it. What irks me is that quite a few ManU fans I have read/interacted with keep bringing up other incidents (like this challenge or Mikel on Valencia or Ramires, etc.) when Chicharito's offside goal is mentioned and conveniently forget their own team's 'transgressions' (like RVP being RVP, Valencia diving, Young making a meal of the Brana last-man challenge, Rafael/Rooney on Ramires, etc.) Clattenburg handled all of these pretty well in the first half, I do admit.

I also can't understand how the overall mood (especially in /r/soccer) has swung a complete 180 degrees since yesterday. I could swear there were all sorts of people agreeing with the fact that we 'got robbed' and suddenly, today, we are being vilified as the club that is possibly the worst one ever to exist in the history of the Premiership.

It didn't work and we should have had all 3 points, as you undoubtedly know. I think that they are pretty easy to defend given the right tactical adjustments and most managers in the league will sort it out and be able to contain what they do, especially Fellaini.

true,PopeTheoskeptik,eng-northumberland,North of The Wall,"She was a real big fan of privatisation and deregulation of state owned industry, really liked Ronald Reagan and was quite paranoid about the USSR.

Before she came to power, there had been an awful lot of industrial disputes in the UK, with power cuts and refuse collection strikes, culminating in [The Winter Of Discontent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_of_Discontent). Much of the electorate was quite cheesed off with all this, and saw the Conservatives as a preferable alternative to the Labour Party (what is referred to these days as 'Old Labour') and the shoddy behaviour by Trade Unions.

At that point, Thatcher's main claim to fame, apart from being the first ever female candidate for PM, was as '[Thatcher the milk snatcher](http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/15/newsid_4486000/4486571.stm)'.

A combination of distaste for the Stalinistic tendencies of the Labour movement and crucially, a big swing vote from a lot of female voters who saw Thatcher as being preferable to the male patriarchal hegemony British politics usually put up on offer, got her elected, and at the time there was much talk of how she was possibly a bit of a sock puppet, having been selected by the tory (male) old guard as a way of getting elected, at which point she'd be disposed of. But she turned out to be a right stubborn cow, and managed to stamp her own agenda onto the proceedings for the next decade.

Her highlights were the Falklands War, which cynics suggested she'd allowed to happen, by not making the usual sabre-rattling noises as the Argentinian junta prepared to invade the islands. Her decision to allow the sinking of the Argentinian battleship [The General Belgrano](http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/2/newsid_2480000/2480241.stm) allegedly put the stymie on peace talks being held by the UN at the time. The jingosim generated in the press helped her get re-elected all smooth-like.

Then there was the miners strike, the winning of which effectively gave Thatcher carte blanche to dismantle the trade union movement, and thus saving the nation from the threat of communism, as was claimed by the likes of The Sun newspaper who claimed the leader of the miners union was in the pay of Moscow. The strike was a tad unpleasant for those involved.

She had a nice and cuddly relationship with Rupert Murdoch, and supported him in [his conflict with the trade unions in the press industry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wapping_dispute).

Yes and no; they still dominated possession in the second half. Not all of their moves were long balls to Fellaini/Jelavic, though that was a concerted strategy. They were also very unfortunate Mirallas had to go off - he had Wisdom looking like Konchesky, through no fault of Wisdom's.

Everton's pressing throughout the game was very good, certainly of similar quality to our own, and forced Brad Jones to distribute the ball long, when we have (probably) the tiniest front 3 in the league. 

&gt; I think that they are pretty easy to defend given the right tactical adjustments and most managers in the league will sort it out and be able to contain what they do, especially Fellaini.

Tactical adjustments? You're overestimating several managers, mate. And Fellaini is like (an in-form) Carroll - it's one thing to know what you have to do against him, another to do it.
