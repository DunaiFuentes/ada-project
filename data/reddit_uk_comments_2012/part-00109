You're totally right in that the show's history is full of the Doctor changing personality and relationships, but the line about ""you die and someone else walks away with your memories."" is really not backed up by anything else.  They decided to make one regeneration seem like death (just for emotional dramatic effect, I guess), without explaining why it was any different from any other regeneration (which bothers me).  So if we were only looking at that one instance, there wouldn't be a lot of wiggle room, but looking at the overall show, that one instance really doesn't gel with the *broader* canon...so it's really hard to just take it at face value.

I mean, even just considering 10 - watch his first episode.  He spends like half of it (slight exaggeration) reiterating that he's the same person.  Even, as sort of discussed above, if 10 doesn't have a problem with regeneration just because he's the new one, not the incarnation that just ended, if regeneration was like death, he's basically lying, and I don't think he would do that.  Even if you don't take it as lying, then I don't think he would demean his previous incarnation by basically just completely brushing it off - if it was like death.

&gt;You can try ironing over it using a towel as well. You'll probably want to use a higher heat and press longer. You don't want direct heat from the iron as that will most likely melt the iron-on and then you have a real mess. Alternatively, you could soak it in warm-hot water. Again, nothing that will be hot enough to melt anything. If you try this method you'll want to be careful not to soak any sponsorships or other iron-ons that you want to remain on the jersey. After heating it up try to slowly peel it off. If it doesn't, apply more heat and possibly for longer. Be warned that depending on the quality of the iron-on used, there may be a permanent residue that is left on the shirt. Also note that I've tried neither of these methods, but in theory they should work considering accidentally washing a jersey on a warm-warm cycle can often lead to them starting to peel off.

I would also think if he had ""Chelsea quality"", then teams better than Liverpool would be more interested in him. Age is also a big factor, Chelsea's policy in light of FFP seems to be to sign players under 23 at almost all costs. Very few exceptions to it and I think at 29, might be enough to rule out Dempsey alone.

As for your point on the enemies, keep in mind, ALL of the enemies, want to rule the human race or the universe. Or at least have some power in the universe. NONE of them want to be destroyed or not having any power. So if they believe that the Doctor is going to be the cause and destructive of the universe, then HELL YEAH they're going to work together to stop that. It's not really that far of a stretch to believe, including the Daleks. It's comparable to Maleficent saving Sora from Dusks so they could defeat Organization XIII and clear the way for her to take Kingdom Hearts in KH II.

The Weeping Angels makes complete and total sense when you take into account that during their first appearence they were WEAK and they were FEW. In their second, not only are there more, but they have also been gaining strength. They've all been holed up together for centuries and creatures /do/ evolve. It stands to reason that they've evolved to the point of possibly withstanding the gaze of another Angel. As for ""That which hold the image of an Angel becomes an Angel itself."" Again, could be chalked up to evolution. In their first appearance, they had to just watch them and while they ""couldn't blink,"" it still made it pretty 'easy' for them to survive. Make the Angels more powerful to because they've been gaining power while waiting this whole time? Definitely. Make them exactly the same and as easily defeated as they were before? Boring. Not compelling at all. Wouldn't make ANY sense.

""Churchill having a direct line to the TARDIS."" You seem to be completely over looking the fact that earlier he rigged Rose's phone to call anything in the universe, including the TARDIS, /as well as/ was given a phone by Martha specifically to call him on whilst in the TARDIS (which she later used to hijack the TARDIS and bring him back to Earth). So, the answer is probably that the Doctor gave him that direct line. :D

As for Van Gogh, though. Smith's Doctor is much more childlike/playful and therefore much more compassionate (not that the Doctor isn't compassionate anyway, Smith's is just one of the more compassionate incarnations). He realizes that Van Gogh is HIGHLY disturbed. And he feels sorry that he just can't see his brillance. He's incredibly empathetic to this incredibly mad genius and quite possibly, connects with him on that level. They're both incredibly brilliant, eccentric men. But the Doctor /knows/ he's brilliant and Van Gogh has the misfortune to not have a clue of how genuinely brilliant he is. Imagine the Doctor in that kind of position. And all of his companions who would show him just how truly brilliant and appreciated he was. He knows his friends would do that for himself, so why wouldn't he do such for his fellow mad genius? Seeing a reflection of himself in Van Gogh, dimmed only by the lack of knowledge of his greatness. It breaks his heart. And he knows, he just absolutely KNOWS, that no matter what he tells him, or what he does, Van Gogh is disturbed beyond all help and salvation. So the Doctor does the only thing he can do. Gives him one, brief moment of appreciation. Gives him true joy and happiness, just for a moment. He's not worried about the outcome because Van Gogh was mad.     No one would believe him. Van Gogh himself probably thought it was just his madness. Nothing was going to happen except a madman, with no friends or family, had joy and kindness in his Life.

true,nallvf,null,null,"I think the broader canon of the show backs it up pretty well, actually. I think, when writing that scene with 10, they took a look at how regeneration actually plays out in the series, and tool a harsh and unromantic look at it. 

I don't think 10 was lying when he said he was still himself, because that's what he was, but he wasn't quite himself. I realize that sounds crazy, but what I mean is he's still the doctor, but he's not 9. It very much seems like a kind of death to me, as he was not at all the same person a second after the regeneration. Have you see the movie ""The Prestige""? I think of it like the ending of that film. If you are the one waking up, it's not so bad. If you are the one dying, then all the parts that make you unique are dying with you, and new parts are replacing them. 

It's interesting to discuss but as far as the show is concerned, we need to trust what the Doctor (10) says about his own regeneration, even if it contradicts previous canon. I mean you can choose to assume it's always been that way, or assume it's just that way for 10, but either way I don't see a lot of value in ignoring it. For me, Doctor Who has always been sort of a tragic show, as it's the only time you get to see the main character of a series die on a regular basis. 11 is all Willy Wonka energetic right now but eventually he's going to get it, the Doctor never gets to ride off into the sunset.",0,1345274097,null,0,1345274431,0,c5uz2q1,t3_yd0i4,t1_c5uz2q1,t1_c5uxl5q,null,1429670193,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Whereas
&gt;Well if you use it as an insult you're being homophobic and if you use it as a word for a cigarette you're not. Does that help?

1) I'm impressed with our signings so far. Each player is young, creative, and works hard. My one concern is that none of them really solve the biggest problem we had last year: we did not score enough goals. Perhaps BR is confident that Downing, Henderson, Adam, and Carroll MUST score more than they did last year. I can easily see Suarez being more prolific as well, and if Gerrard is healthy for the entire year 10+ goals shouldn't be past him. Still, I would like to see us sign another attacking player who is a guaranteed goal scorer.

2) I think that Borini should start today with Allen and maybe Assaidi coming off the bench.

**DAWKINS GOT THIS ONE WRONG FOLKS**

I don't mind a bit of Dawkins now and then but in this case I have to agree with his dissenters; he's taking what's actually happened, debasing it and turning it into ammunition for his crusade against religion. The abolishment of religion from the state establishment is something I would like but not when you corrupt your integrity to further your goals.

&gt; It seems that the High Court judges could find only one serious objection to treating Tony Nicklinson humanely, and granting him his clearly expressed wish about what should happen to his own body. The objection is that there is ""no precedent"".

~ http://rdfrs.com/foundation_articles/2012/8/17/no-precedent-then-set-one#.UC9beKOP-Z0, third from last paragraph.

Dawkins assertion here is incorrect. The final decision by the court was not that these men should not be allowed to exercise their individual rights because there was no precedent, the final decision was that the court should not make a ruling in favour of the men because it's not the place of the courts to make such a sweeping ruling under the system of government in the UK - that position is held by Parliament. Religion never came into the decision, it's a matter of administrative leave.

&gt;  Tony’s and Martin’s circumstances are deeply moving. Their desire to have control over the ending of their lives demands the most careful and sympathetic consideration, but there are also other important issues to consider. A decision to allow their claims would have consequences far beyond the present cases. To do as Tony wants, the court would be making a major change in the law. To do as Martin wants, the court would be compelling the DPP to go beyond his established legal role. These are not things which the court should do. It is not for the court to decide whether the law about assisted dying should be changed and, if so, what safeguards should be put in place. Under our system of government these are matters for Parliament to decide, representing society as a whole, after Parliamentary scrutiny, and not for the court on the facts of an individual case or cases. For those reasons I would refuse these applications for judicial review.

~ http://www.scribd.com/doc/103065944/Tony-Nicklinson-Judgment#fullscreen, paragraph 150

If you want to check the Judge decision then the only mention of the word ""precedent"" that I could find was in paragraph 78.

&gt; A court hearing an individual case, concentrating rightly and inevitably on the dire circumstances of the claimant, is not in a position to decide such broader questions, but its decision would create a precedent which would affect many other cases.

~ http://www.scribd.com/doc/103065944/Tony-Nicklinson-Judgment#fullscreen, paragraph 78

The point the Judge's are coming to here is that they're not responsible for constructing the law. It's the remit and responsibility of the judiciary to uphold the law and to see justice done.

Dawkins is wrong in this case. Dawkins is using the pain and suffering of two brave men to further his own goals and it's being lapped up by people who are unwilling to question him and his motives. If you've ever argued that religion causes problems because it's followers don't criticise or analyse what they're being told then I want you to take a good long moment to reflect honestly and absolutely on your response to what Dawkins wrote in this article.

Did you criticise or analyse anything he said? Did you read the Judge's desicison? If you didn't you might want to consider checking your brand of Dawkinism for the same blindness and unquestioning acceptance of facts that you criticise from the faiths you abhor so much.

Their response was a joking reply that they ran on 'Tico Time' (Tico and, I think, Tica,  is slang for a resident of Costa Rica). Tico time was a national phenomena of people being fairly casual about time, not worrying about being late. Indonesia has 'rubber time' (it stretches!) that is similar.

&gt;Anton Vickerman designed the ‘front end’ of the website and via the internet recruited programmers who ran the ‘back end’ functions of the site.  **These programmers were tasked to break the security on the third party sites that hosted infringing copies of films.**   As a result surfthechannel developed a sophisticated and vast index of films and TV programmes with *the majority obtained illegally* by the third party sites.  Vickerman did not have permission from the producers/distributors of those films or TV programmes to show or distribute their content.

2) Borini will start, I hope Allen starts but it might be too soon so he'll come on from the bench. If Assaidi comes on it will be a cameo at best, but I doubt it.

3) Wigan v Chelsea, because Wigan usually give a good scare to Chelsea and I want to see Hazard fall over the ball again; it's so much funnier when it happens to not-Carroll.

    being regular, LFC play 60 matches at least, Lucas and Gerrard are the ones who we hope will play 30,

Our constitution is a lot more complex just than 'Parliament is sovereign', although that's a large part of it that allows our constitution, nearly uniquely, to be so easily changeable. 

However, if you read *Jackson v A-G* then you'll see the HL talking about how they wouldn't allow parliament to go against core constitutional principles, so even the statement 'Parliament is sovereign' is quite a controversial one (on which I just wrote a 5000 word essay I might add).

I should also say that writing that essay made me aware of how much debate there is over what actually constitutes our constitution, so it could be that you're just coming from a different viewpoint, however most lawyers would accept that there are constitutional statutes.

Edit: I know I shouldn't, but just to quickly support my point I'll point you towards a line of a Wikipedia article:

true,Swiftfooted,eng-northumberland,Geordie in London,"I should say that I'm personally in favour of euthanasia. However, I come from a family of doctors with whom I've had many debates and come to realise that while I believe that people should have the right-to-die, it's not a clear cut issue. I can tell you that I know of people who have had family members die of cancer and remain opposed to euthanasia, so they do exist.

I pointed out palliative care, because I've found it the most convincing of all anti-euthanasia arguments. I'm not sure if there's any evidence to say that it would stunt palliative care, but I believe that this is the way the argument goes:

Euthanasia is only really needed to end suffering. Therefore if palliative care is good enough, then suffering is massively diminished and we don't need euthanasia. Clearly then, if we care about life over death, palliative care is to be protected. However, if euthanasia becomes an option many people would choose it over palliative care, possibly either due to a lack of education over the benefits of palliative care or due to the lack of proper provision of palliative care in certain areas. This will inevitably draw resources away from palliative care and towards euthanasia. Now, the way to solve the lack of proper provision isn't to make euthanasia an option, but rather to improve palliative care.

Back to my thoughts, and it doesn't seem a stretch to say that legalising euthanasia will affect palliative care negatively in some way (although I'm probably not doing the argument justice).

This often means drawing out routine paperwork that would take an hour for as long as is physically possible.

This cultural phenomenon has contributed to a number of social issues in Japan, most notably in the effect a non present father has on his family. In a number of cases, the children are actually unaware that their father actually lives in the same house as them because he practically lives at work twiddling his thumbs constantly trying to look like he's doing his best. The supremely judgemental and subservient worker culture has also contributed to a world beating suicide rate.

&gt; If its considered an option for Tony, its going to become increasingly more of an option that other sufferers choose, maybe not because they genuinely want to die, but because they hate being a burden on the NHS, or their family.

Oh, they're allowed to refuse treatment, save the NHS a lot of money, they just have to suffer. The only result of blocking this is that people suffer needlessly.

It's my experience that people who want to live to not choose to die, even if they don't want to be a burden. It seems complete scaremongering and slippery slope arguments, that are completely baseless.

&gt; We're absically saying that once youre like Tony, youre worthless and your life is considered worthless enough to take.

Not even remotely, I don't understand how you can come to that conclusion. This is exactly the kind of thing I hate. Somehow because someone has freedom and a desire to stop suffering, they are existentially troubling the stupid who also happen to be disabled (because the majority of disabled people support the right to die, as do all right-minded moral people).

Think about this, why is it that these people care so much about the lives of peoples but seemingly don't care at all about their suffering? It's probably because they are not living it, most of them won't ever live it, they have no empathy for people who are not them.

&gt; And we admit that ""its their choice, they should be allowed"" then where is the point in building fences on bridges and trying to stop people committing suicide.

* You won't stop someone who really wants to commit suicide from doing so unless they are incapacitated in some way.

* Trying to convince someone life is worth living is not the same as forcing someone to stay alive. Please, write a comment about how Tony Nicklinson shouldn't want to die.

Except of course for the fact that her son had been so cruelly taken from her and left to rot in an undisclosed location.  Most of the interview was fine, but as she broke down, weeping ""I just want him back before I die"", we all felt...well, terrible really.  What can you say to a woman in her position?

true,Maslo55,null,null,"&gt;Your evolutionary morality doesnt hold up in that we often choose to do the right thing even when not scrutinised by society.

People also often chose to jerk off even when it clearly does not contribute to having an offspring. Does it mean sexuality could not have evolved?

&gt;On op of that, if altruism is truely evolution at work, then why isnt our society more altruistic?

Because too much altruism is also harmful for evolutionary fitness.

&gt;His society was entirely against what he did, yet he individualy had the altruism available to risk his life saving Jews.

He earned the loyality of all Jews, and especially the people he saved.

Evolution does not need to come up with perfect solution, just good enough solution. Behaviour does not need to be advantageous, just not harmful, for it to be preserved by evolution.

&gt;Yes but why? It helps noone? You say it like, ""oh yeah its just a byproduct"" but you have zero proof for that concept at all. yet you consider it scientific, and more so than my belief that it stems from something innate to the world.

Not all theories are created equal. Occams Razor favors simplest explanations (in the sense - with least amount of unproven entities). Materialistic theories are favored over dualistic theories because they can explain the observed with just matter, while dualistic require matter **and** the supernatural.

I think you're totally missing the point and reading far too much into these things. Who has an arsehole and who hasn't got an arsehole is entirely irrelevant to the insult ""You are an arsehole"".

&gt;I've just started really thinking about a lot of the types if words we use as insults recently.

There is a very small argument that could argue it is sexist by equating ""You are a cunt"" to ""You are part of a woman"", but everybody knows that the insult isn't derived from ""Being part of a woman"" - it's from ""being *that* part of a woman""!

My mother is a nurse in palliative care, i.e. people who are dying, the best case outcome for the people she looks after is that they have a painless death with their family around them, so I put quite a lot of weight on what she has to say about issues like this, because she deals with this stuff every day (she is not religious is the slightest).

She, and her co-workers are extremely sceptical of introducing assisted suicide, essentially their issue is that you need to be really careful that you're not going to allow people to kill themselves on the basis that they feel like they are a burden to their families. This is already an issue in hospitals where its not uncommon for the elderly or severely disabled to feel they are a hassle to their children, they have nothing left to live for, suffering periods of depression and becoming suicidal. Mostly this is treated with counselling and people get through it and end up having good peaceful deaths, but its important that its really difficult to get assisted suicide from the NHS, because really, you need to be absolutely sure why the person wants to die, and that their reasoning isn't based on an inaccurate portrayal of the importance or significance of their lives to others.

Apparently generally it's not so bad, but sometimes, if you are young it can be pretty bad and if you are left unskilled it's very bad.

But they have more practical training than we do in the UK, so more people can get more jobs - the teenagers just seemed more realistic and geared towards jobs that actually exist rather than everyone wanting to go into 'creative industries' or study Literature or whatever.

Also that's assuming you can get a job with a 40 hour week - if you've seen the latest statistics you will see that 'Underemployment' has continued to get worse despite a plateauing of the other figures, so many people are stuck working part-time.

Also people don't make jobs unless they absolutely have to, as from a business perspective it's a pretty big thing to have to do, so I don't see why the difference between paying 3 quid and hour or 7 quid would really have a massive effect - if they need the labour, they'll pay, if not - they won't hire in the first place.",0,1345296570,null,0,false,0,c5v1b2p,t3_yex9u,t1_c5v1b2p,t1_c5v1947,null,1429671302,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,Riddla26,eng-manchester,Manchester - City Of Science,"Firstly, rise or salary, £3m a year would feed, clothe and house on average (assuming a combined family income of £50,000 p/a taking into account the wealthiest and poorest areas, which really isn't that bad to start with) **SIXTY** 2 adults, 2 minors makeup families. I don't do at all badly myself so it's not like I'm in any way jealous but I still feel it's a disgrace to give one person that much money per year regardless of what their title is.

So **one** person gets enough money to completely look after **SIXTY** families for one year, all because he's making the top dogs *MORE money than they already had, when they were already super rich.* This is my entire point, it's massively disproportionate when you do look at the people who work 40 hour weeks for less than £15,000 per year *and* that's before taxes, the people without whom there would be no basis for said top dogs making that much money in the first place. This is where capitalism is failing, where companies are failing and where the government is also failing, because they just want to see positive numbers on graphs. A long time ago they actually cared about the people of the country, then someone invented a graph to show how the people were doing, then someone else managed to disconnect the welfare of the people from the plot of the graph and hook it into the bank balance of the biggest companies and now all that's left is the graph and the blind faith of a tired, ineffective government.

Secondly, you're damn right it's about what people ""deserve"". It's about the line where people end and the corporation begins, where people become numbers, no one has value, there's a million more waiting in line for their jobs and no one is held accountable for the (often) illegal working conditions many people have to put up with. What happened to ethical business standards? In the mid-80's and early 90's you couldn't move for ethical treatment of workers in the majority of places, nowadays employers spit like you've called their grandmother a cunt for even suggesting they treat people fairly. Do people deserve that? Do they deserve to have no rights, to be constantly reminded that they have no value or worth in any sense of the word?

Justin King might be worth his salary to the super-rich that own the company but at the end of the day he's *just another worker*. If you're going to rate workers by value to the company, every shelf stocker should be on £100,000 a year, they're in many cases just as important to the continuing profitability of the company as Mr. King is. In fact he owes them his job. If they weren't there, he would have no reason to be given that money. It's all about the perception of worth and right now it's completely fucked up, because greedy, feckless people are hiding behind the façade of corporatism and the non-accountability that comes with it.

Furthermore, what about all this record profit everyone's seeing? We're all in a recession apparently, fiscally speaking that kind of growth shouldn't even be possible but no, of course your average Joe's wages only increase by 1.6%, not even enough to cover inflation, sorry Joe, looks like you'll have to tighten your belt for another year and hope nothing expensive breaks otherwise Joe Jr isn't going to that private school you hoped would set him up with a good enough education so that his family isn't in the shitter in 30 years time, meanwhile your bosses boss is off to their private beach house in Miami on their private jet for 4 weeks and that's put a strain on everyone, so you'll probably have to pick up some of the slack from the other departments, okay?

Fine, the FTSE companies aren't just the banks, but the banks did lead us into this mess. On purpose in fact, singing and dancing, just so another graph looked a bit better for a few more months. Or have you just forgotten the LIBOR fixing thing already?

£3m is a drop in the ocean to companies but it's nothing short of a lifeline to 60 average families who struggle on a day to day basis to keep hold of what they were promised by the banks they could afford when the banks needed money, to stop those same banks taking it off them again now they need more money. As you've said, £3m is a drop in the ocean, but what's the point in the ocean? Why have that much money? All they use it for is to get more money and that in turn makes it worse for the rest of us.

This isn't even an economical question, it's an ethical one. As soon as a person feels they're making decisions for a company, all traces of ethical behaviour and moral compassion give way to the pursuit of the ever bigger payout. It's all well and good saying ""that's just the way it is"", but it doesn't make it any more right, ethical or just. It's still just as wrong in Europe as it is in America, Africa and Asia, the difference is places like China are further long with the breakdown than we are, where people are willing to commit suicide en masse to protest their working conditions, where they'd rather die than continue working under the boot of the same brand of super-rich that we've started to see in this country over the last 10 years.

To all of this I have one simple statement: I would rather see the country in ruins than become that. I would rather watch the whole place burn to the ground before I submitted my basic human rights to live and work and be treated with dignity and paid fairly for the work I did. I will campaign, subvert and expose corruption and unfair treatment to delay that transformation and if all else fails, immigrate. I refuse to live in a world where this is the norm for my fellow human beings. Even if that's too much to grasp, let me condense it just *a little* further for you:

McCormack looked really comfortable in the Snodgrass role and Becchio was superb.

And, something I never thought I'd say, but Diouf came on and played the perfect role today.  He didn't play for himself, he dived a LOT, but in that stage of the game that's what we needed.  He did sensible hold-up play and looked handy on a set-piece.  Quite impressed.

Luke Varney on the other hand had the first touch of a rapist and misplaced some really critical passes; not a bad debut but could have been brighter.

It's silly to suggest that just because I appreciated it, I'm making plans to move there.

I don't really like the productive hustle. As long as work gets done, I don't think there's such a great need to be obsessive about starting at exactly the right minute. I don't like the fact some people worry that if they get the work done, they'll be given extra simply so they seem productive. There are people who sit at work for hours waiting for something the next task to come along, yet aren't allowed to bring a book, for fear that they'll look unproductive.

Business and industry make great stuff, but I think, as a culture, there can be too much worrying about being productive *all the time* rather than getting what needs to be done, done. It would be better for everybody if we could relax a little and understand that as long as we're working as we should, we don't need to panic.

true,dalekai,dalek,Dalek,"I haven't seen the last three episodes yet, and the general consensus seems to be that the end is terrible, so I won't flat out disagree with you until I do, but I wouldn't judge anything based on the last episode anyway even if the conclusion is disappointing. Also the very first episode of TW is weird. It's a show about aliens targeted at a more adult audience than DW. It's going to be weirder.

So far, MD is EXCELLENT story telling. It feels ""weird"" to everyone because 3/4 of the way through, we haven't linked anything to aliens yet. But I always thought that was the best part of TW. They have so many limitations the Doctor just doesn't have to worry about merely because they're bound to the Earth with limited technology. This is what it would be like for real people. I find it refreshing that there isn't always a convenient Doctor idea or tech that advances the plot easily.

Also, RTD can really write social commentary well. I think both Children of Earth and Miracle Day are brilliant because they assess people so well. Whenever we see something global happening in DW, we see vague news reports and scared people and usually some military intervention. TW shows us what would happen on a massive legal scale (and how the politicians would actually sell an alien invasion to us - in DW the news reporters flat out say ""we've got aliens running amok!"") and really explores how dark humans can be when it's every man for himself. DW usually just asserts how good natured and resilient most of us are and that aliens are the screwed up ones.

It's actually one thing that disappoints me about DW. People just readily accept that aliens exist all of a sudden. Torchwood shows us the perspectives of the other people that would see alien intervention and wouldn't know. Gwen says in the first episode that all the alien sightings were chalked up to terrorism. Politicians come up with other more public friendly stories to tell people. Religious zealots blame events on the rapture. Not everyone is like ""okay aliens, I can swing this."" I find the characters to be refreshing. It's easy to believe in aliens when you're a companion to the Doctor. When you just have to trust someone blindly who goes against the government, well I don't know about anyone else, but I'd be thinking ""crazy conspiracy theorist"" in real life.

**TL:DR Torchwood** really explores humanity when the Doctor isn't around to save us. If you expect it to do the same things DW, you're going to be disappointed because it doesn't encompass 1/10 of the scale DW can. It's a different show with different themes and it has different strengths and obviously, different weaknesses but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be considered canon because you don't like it. This is especially true to anyone who admitted they watched two episodes and didn't like it. That's like saying ""Smith is the best re-boot Doctor but I haven't seen seasons 1-4."" It's not a fair comparison.

As a slightly relevant sidenote, about halfway through Miracle Day, I was *convinced* we were dealing with the Family of Blood and that ""the miracle"" was actually the Family punishing the Doctor for how he'd imprisoned them. I assume that probably isn't the case because I can't even imagine how that would suck.

Now let's put it in perspective.  The first week (or two) of the season is usually the time you see whopping defeats by many goals.  This is usually the experienced, overly talented squads (Chelsea, United, etc.) beating down on the lower clubs who are still figuring things out.  The lower clubs are much more likely to have new players, managers, tactics, etc.

LFC HAVE a new manager, a load of new players, and wholly different tactics.  LFC have the *talent*, but they are more like a low/mid table team at the start of the season.  The talent means that things can get better, **quickly**.  Remember Arsenal's abysmal start last year--they finished ~~fourth~~ third.

Shit reffing aside, we never deserved to win that. We looked terrible after the first 30 minutes and West Brom looked great. Didn't deserve such a bad score line or a banned Agger, but the blame isn't solely on the ref. This is just about as bad a game as it could be. Multiple penalties with one going in, three goals against us total, red card for Agger, and an injury to Cole (still a Liverpool player, like him or not).

I imagine this will temper expectations for the season for most of us. We have a lot of work to do. Downing has to be replaced. I want him to do well, but he provides nothing but misery. Hopefully Assaidi (sp?) can pick it up or if the rumors about Dempsey are true he'd likely do well in that spot.

We weren't good enough. Andy Carroll is the only one playing for the shirt. Steve Clarke is a genius. Phil Dowd is a cunt. Welcome to Liverpool FC, Rodgers.

Never a pen, never a sending off.   Skrtel's looked odd, but was probably legit.   I don't understand how Olsson did not get 3 yellow cards, and all/most of ours were soft.

true,ihatephilosophy,lfc99,,"Since joining the subreddit, I've read people's comments wondering what people are talking about when they gush love over some of these players.

-Glen Johnson: Always gives the ball up too easy. Love the way he pushes but his cross are rarely good. He throws it into defenders too much. Always did this for Liverpool, did this for England, still does this.

-Lucas Leiva: Everyone loves him. Good defensive midfielder. Horrible passing midfielder. Watching him pass the ball is painful. In this system, he is just going to hurt us. The whole point of passing and maintaining possession is to not have to defend as much. When Lucas makes these awkward passes that make maintaining possession harder, he is hurting the team.

-Downing: Was hoping he would be better after preseason, he wasn't. Why cross so much in a possession based system? Between Downing and Johnson, we might as well just get to opponents third and hand them the ball.

After the 2 penalties we collapsed, which to be fair blah blah Liverpool way but the referees bias was painfully obvious.

The ref won this match for WBA.  Downing was through, offsides.  Long gets touched outside the box and dives.  Red card?  Long trips over Skrtel after barging into him.  Penalty.  Olson blatantly throwing elbows and harming our players.  No cards.  Yes the boo boys will say Liverpool deserved to lose on the balance of play, but only after the 2 penalties  which sealed it for WBA which WERE NOT Liverpool's fault.

4. Lucas Leiva - 85.6 per cent from 687 passes

So, according to statistics, Jay Spearing is a more accurate passer than Lucas Leiva during the 2011-2012 season. 

Maybe if Lucas is too injured to pass he, gasp, shouldn't be playing?!

Edit: Wanted to point out, Allen isn't a bad defender and, by all accounts, a better passer than Lucas. Henderson is a more offensive minded player without being offensive minded the way Adam is.

It's also interesting that some local licensing requirements that pubs etc must offer free tap water came into being after the Leah Betts case.

It's really scary that drugs scares can lead to policy being made that actually encourage *potentially fatal* behaviour on said drugs. Ecstasy makes you pass less water and drinking excessive water under its influence can be extremely dangerous.

true,dalekai,dalek,Dalek,"&gt; Also, I never said I expected TW to feel like DW; I don't know if that particular part of the comment was directed at someone else or not.

Not specifically at you. You kind of serve as a representative for people that don't like MD because you made the comment and they upvoted.

A lot of times when I see people say they don't like TW, it's because they compare it too closely to DW (or they say things like ""I haven't seen more than a handful of episodes but it's terrible!"" People make this same argument about pre-Moffat Who and it makes me very sad because there aren't a lot of shows with 100% good episodes because it all comes down to taste, which is subjective). RTD said he left DW because the team disagreed about the future direction of the show and I really feel like TW was his opportunity to do darker, more adult storylines. That isn't going to jive with the entire Who fanbase.

Also, I'm sorry MD was a letdown for you. I know that was your point. I was trying to express why, even if the end sucks, it wasn't a letdown for me to not only you, but everyone who says they watched the first two episodes and it sucked so they stopped. It's a different show and not everyone who likes DW is going to like it, but it's not really fair for those people to say it sucks if they didn't watch it and/or compared it to DW. 

I was most put off by your assertion that it shouldn't be considered canon under the premise that you didn't like it. Because I think it's brilliant thus far for the reasons already stated. It feels more mature to me and though that's a positive thing for me, it could very well be a negative thing for someone else that enjoys the more light-hearted approach. Thanks for reading my giant walls of text.

Edit: I know where you're coming from when you say it doesn't feel like TW normally feels. It's because we lost most of the characters we grew attached to, the setting is different, and 3/4 of the way through, we've haven't been able to trace anything back to aliens. It just feels so grounded to me. The Doctor never loses his power because he's always the Doctor. TW was completely dependent on government support of the agency to exist, thus it falls apart when the government is fighting it, and RTD loves to play with the concept of human helplessness. In his DW storylines, humanity is completely screwed when the Doctor is out of commission and TW, it (mostly) human.

It requires basic cooking knowledge and purchasing of things like rice, pasta, frozen veg, whole chickens or packs of cooking bacon.

You can get a whole chicken from most supermarkets for around £3, a 1kg bag of rice for about £1 (Gets cheaper if you buy bigger bags), frozen veg for £1 a kg bag, and pasta is usually slightly less than the rice per kilo.

So that's around £6 of your budget. Throw in something like a 400 bag of nuts for snacking and that's another £1.20. Then 2 tins of tuna and a jar of mayonnaise to go with the pasta and that's around £9.20. (50p for a tin of tuna, £1 for the mayo, because while cheap tuna doesn't taste too bad, mix it with cheap mayo and it tastes like shit.)

So there you have a mix of pasta, tuna, and mayo. And a whole chicken to go at along with rice and veg. That would easily last me a week.

The problem a lot of people have is that they pay £6 for a couple of chicken fillets, or £4 for some fresh ground beef that only lasts 2 meals.

A whole chicken properly cooked and plated up with some simple rice and veg can last a single person at least 5 days. You can even make soup out of the bones.",0,1345309177,null,0,false,0,c5v3nm8,t3_yfg5g,t1_c5v3nm8,t1_c5v34cl,null,1429672406,27,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,27

You say the Phillies were always a threat, but City weren't.  In fact from the mid-70s until the mid-00s we were nothing like a threat.  We were seen as being everyone's second favourite team because we were a calamity, but we were always able to have a laugh at our own expense.  We remain to this day the only team to have been relegated the season after winning the league;  we are the only team to have scored 100 goals in same season as conceding 100 goals.

Now we're super rich and have an amazing team (we have plenty of club legends, but realistically this current team would destroy any all-star team you could come up with).  We won the league last season for the first time in 44 years and look strong enough to be in the mix again this season.  As such, we're no longer everyone's second favourite team - now we're one of the most unpopular teams in the world.

If you're set on City (and believe me, it's a good choice, I just don't want you to regret it and change teams because that is a HUGE faux pas among football fans), then I'd suggest starting [here](http://mcfc.co.uk/The-Club/Club-History).

1. RB, Ivan can't do the job very efficiently and what if he gets a red card or gets injured.
2. LB, It hasn't been talked about much, but I see Bertrand as more of an effective LM than a LB, we don't really have a class act player to fill in case Cole decides to not step up and plus he's getting a bit older now. 
3. RW, I don't necessarily think we're going to need another striker as long as we have players that can cause trouble on the wing and cut the ball inside for the goal poachers we already have.

Skrtel's penalty was soft, but we were already losing the game at that point. We could have had some decisions in our favour, but we got nothing.

None of this affects the fact that we didn't score any goals. Like last season, we had a lot of scruffy chances, but not as many clear-cut ones as you'd hope for. What we create is enough to get you on the edge of the seat, but never quite enough to count.

Also, as against Gomel, we looked incredibly vulnerable to counter-attacks all the way through. West Brom had a good number of decent chances that they could have rued had they not banged in plenty of others. Again, this is like last year: the chances we give away to the opposition seem to always be on a plate, leaving Reina with no chance. It's a topic that comes up a lot on the Anfield Wrap podcast, how the chances we allow others always seem to be better than the half-chances we create for ourselves.

So, we didn't score any goals, but gave West Brom plenty of chances to score some for themselves. It's very hard to see how either of those things is Phil Dowd's fault. He was shit and although I'm biased it seemed everything went against us (Suarez and Lucas getting booked for things West Brom players got away with, penalties at one end that seemed less clear-cut than fouls on Kelly and Downing at the other), but that's a distraction from the fact that Liverpool were poor and West Brom were pretty decent: superior in both tactical organisation and, on the day, individual ability.",0,1345313113,null,0,false,0,c5v4jf1,t3_yfkpe,t1_c5v4jf1,t1_c5v3ur6,null,1429672823,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

**Downing** was awful. For every time he cut inside against Gomel and did something useful, he went outside today and did something terrible, like trying to cross with his right foot.

**Suarez** had at least half a dozen nutmegs to beat players, but he also blew three wonderful chances inside the 6-yard box. Two on clear and open headers, and one where the WBA keep dropped the ball cleanly onto his fucking right boot. That should have torn the nets off the woodwork.

true,ravniel,num11,,"1) Those aren't mutually exclusive.  The Modric money does not constitute our full transfer budget.  Money for a striker exists notwithstanding any deal for Modric.  This is a player we've bid for in the past when Modric's departure was not in the offing.  Besides, if Adebayor comes he'll cost us next to nothing.

2) Normally this is much too high a fee for a player with one year left on his contract, but buying from Bilbao is unique.  Their recruitment policy essentially means they can't replace the player, which means profiting from the sale doesn't do anything for them.  They're fan-owned and have plenty of money, especially as they've reportedly sold Javi Martinez for *also* more than he was worth.  Even if the price isn't all that reasonable it's unlikely they'll be pushed to lower it.

3) Llorente will fucking tear up the Premier League.  He's big, he's strong, he's equally good in the air or on the ground, he's technical enough to play a passing system in La Liga.

Allen impressed me with his passing, 96%! Gerrard was a passenger, Lucas clearly wasn't 100% fit.

Poor defending too. Doesn't matter if Agger didn't foul Long really, the fact is that he was allowed to get into that position in the first place.

Kelly wasn't very good either, which is a shame, because he's one of my favourite players.

Yeah, it needs filling by two players.  Adebayor and someone else.  We need a second center-forward *far* more than we need a keeper.  Friedel will do for this season, if he has to.

&gt; I highly doubt Llorente is coming.

I'm not saying it's going to happen, but this is a player we've bid for in the past and Balague isn't the first to suggest we're going after him again.

Besides, Llorente is going for, what, €36 MM? That's much more than Damiao.

Tottenham and Arsenal received big spankings early on last season and they both managed to rally and have very respectable campaigns as we saw. Thursday we play Hearts and it gives our men the opportunity to work on themselves and hopefully to gain a bit of confidence so they're not going into the weekend game against City feeling negative. In the pre-season we were all so full of optimism, and I don't think it was unfounded. We have a manager we can believe in and a future that looks bright that was can realistically reach. But to reach that future, we have to slog through the problems and obstacles of the present and we have to be patient while Rodgers and the team bring it all together and improve.

A second later and Ebanks-Blake would've put his foot through it, while aiming at an open net. They did hit the crossbar, too, but that was the only 'heart-in-mouth' moment for me.

true,ravniel,num11,,"&gt; Though we're much more comfortable with Friedel, what if he gets injured?

The guy's started something like 305 consecutive Premier League games, I'm not super worried about him getting injured.  It's something we have to plan for, of course, but Cudicini and Gomes is a perfectly respectable GK bench even if I wouldn't want either as full-time #1.

&gt; As far as Llorente and Ade - both want to start. Do you think either is willing to sit on the bench?

This is as it should be.  The goal of every big team is to have competition for every position and players on the bench who are good enough to start.  It can be tough to balance, sure, but that's our job, and we play in four competitions.  Everyone will get minutes.  Adebayor will sure as hell get more for us as he would for City.  And if I have to choose one of them to irritate by depriving them of minutes, I choose Adebayor every time.  Llorente really is brilliant.

&gt; Besides, Llorente is going for, what, €36 MM? That's much more than Damiao.

I don't think it is.  I don't know what we've bid but almost every valuation of Damiao I've seen places him north of 20 million pounds.  Transfermarkt says 22 million.  If we're talking about 22 million for Damiao or 28 million for Llorente I won't hesitate to say which I think is the better value for the money.

&gt; I'm really trying to stay grounded here.

That's a good instinct, but if staying grounded means starting the season with a worse team than we should have had, I can't support it.  We won't be helping AVB out by not buying him a brilliant striker.  Quite the opposite.

* WBA forced the wingers outside to cross with their weaker foot. 
* No real aerial attacking presence in the box but this didnt matter because the crosses in were shit. 
* Joe Allen and Borini are going to be very good players.

I don't think Livermore or Huddlestone is good enough and the latter may not be getting along with AVB anyway, if rumor is to be believed. I would still very much like Moutinho. I don't think that's at all likely as Porto don't look like they're budging on price, but sometime like him should be a high priority.

That said, I honestly think we have more money than people seem to be suggesting and needn't choose between our midfield and our strike force. Let's say Luka goes for 30m pounds even, and then we pay full price for all three targets we're discussing here (not likely but bear with me). 24m for Moutinho, 5m for Adebayor, 28m for Llorente. That would bring our net spend for the summer (counting earlier deals) to about 35 million. That's high, but not ridiculous for a team of our size who have spent practically nothing for two years - especially if you consider that the strikers we'd be replacing left in previous windows for a total of about 20m. And after that we'd have almost an entire team of relatively young, world-class players on long contracts and wouldn't have to buy big in those positions for *years*. That's worth one summer splurge. Especially if we were willing to bid 13 million for the likes of Gaston Ramirez.

Tactically, it's the perfect attacking force with great defensive players. If something goes wrong with the attack, either Nasri or Tevez gets subbed for De Jong so Toure goes a bit forward, which has worked magic for now. If something goes wrong with defence, An attacking player goes off for the LB or RB who's benched to play defensive midfield on their flank, entering a position of a LWB/RWB.

true,[deleted],null,null,"We've had an *okay* window so far but the biggest thing that has stopped us from signing players is the international tournaments and the breaks, plus some bad luck.

Euro, Euro U19, and Olympics. These tournaments inflated the prices of players we were looking for and opened other club's eyes to the same players we were interested in.

Madrid - Modric situation. Had Modric kept his mouth quiet and trained as normal I think we would have had this transfer (and a few others hinging on it) finalized.

Ade - City situation. This one is out of our hands. We agree with the two parties but both parties are having trouble between themselves.

Daniel Levy's wife's illness. It's hard to focus on something so trivial (relative to his situation of course) when your wife is in such bad shape.

New manager. He needed to learn the team, the players, and make his own judgements first. There is a hell of a lot that goes into taking the helm at a new club and I am sure this caused a lot of problems early on. 

Gylfi and Jan were two signings that were easily and that we stumbled upon. We got rid of some fringe players and surely will get rid of a couple more in the next week or two. We'll bring in a few players, too.

The thing to remember us AVB wasn't the manager before the summer. He didn't have time to assess his and the club's needs. The time for him to do that was during this transfer window so there were few chances that this transfer window would have went smoothly. The clubs that have new managers this season didn't make big or quick moves, it's just not what happens. Teams like Arsenal, Chelsea, or United did because they have managers already attuned to the club's needs.

Expect January and later to be much smoother. I'm sure once AVB gets settled with the team, picks his favorites, and refines his tactics we'll see moves made earlier. 

Also, please don't downvote this thread. I think a lot of good discussion can come from it. The OP wrote very panicked as i'm sure we're all a bit stressed going into the home stretch. 

TL;DR: so much shit happened this summer it would have required divine intervention to go semi smoothly.

I think the idea is 1 central defender probably, 2 wing backs, 2 for lack of a better term, wide box-to-box midfielders, 1 central midfielder, 2 attacking midfielders, supporting 2 strikers. The issue, as was raised in the article is that we don't really have the people to perform the wide midfield roles. Milner could be perfect on one side, but we don't really have anyone to do that job on the other flank. This is what it would look like if we were to use the 3-5-2 formation the same way Juventus did.

I know this sounds absurd, but what would happen if Richards were moved up to the wide-mid role, Zaba brought in to replace him in back, and Milner moved across to where Kolarov is? As the article mentioned, Richards sometimes moves forward too readily, and doesn't get back in time to properly defend. But while his overzealousness on attack is sometimes an issue in the back line, he may be better suited to the balance of attack and defense required for the wide box-to-box role. Milner, can obviously play both sides well, so that wouldn't be a huge problem, and Zaba I think is a far better right back than this article suggests, especially in light of his performance in the last few games of last season.",0,1345326857,null,0,1346608830,0,c5v7eeq,t3_yfux4,t1_c5v7eeq,t1_c5v6mdl,null,1429674238,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

Kenny - 8 - Solid performance, great vision and pass to pick out Ross for the goal. Didn't really have to make a save the rest of the game

Bryam - 8 - Great debut, didn't look out of place at all and kept Jarvis quiet most of the game

Peltier - 7 - No nonsense, did what he had to exposed in the air a couple of times but then he's not really a centre half. Seems like a good choice for captain too.

Pearce - 7 - Missed a header early on but was dominant in the air for the rest of the game. 

White - 6 - DAT SLIP. Silly booking. Not much going forward but that might have been the game plan.

Green - 6 - Worked hard in attack and defence. Hope the injury isn't serious, with such a threadbare squad we cant afford many midfield injuries

Austin - 9 - MoM This guy was everywhere! putting in tackles helping out the defence starting attacks and dangerous from the set piece. Seems to be the midfielder we've been lacking for a few years. Hopefully he can maintain this level of performance

Varney - 5 - As someone said in another thread he had the first touch of a rapist today. Got into good positions but a relatively quiet game.

Norris - 8 - Seemed to mesh well with Austin, not afraid to make a tackle either. Kept Wolves' centre mids out of the game.

Becchio - 7 - Frustrating player to watch and I'm guessing a frustrating player to play against. Took the goal well, fell over a lot. Stupid yellow card.

McCormack - 8 - DAT FIRST TOUCH. Great assist. Ran at people with pace and looked threatening all day. Glad he's signed up.

I thought he would come on and fanny about looking disinterested until he could attack, but to his credit he seemed to work hard in defence as well as attack and controlled the last 15mins. Showed some good skill and with a bit more match fitness could do a job for us I reckon.

You say it would be necessary to remove people who do not want to live as an anarchist from the community, but I have a lot of issues with this. The nature of an anarchist society is that it is not violently coercive, people would be allowed to leave, but not forcibly removed just for political ideologies. As for your suggested reasons as to why they must be removed, well:

I don't honestly see why anyone would try to create a hierarchy. Currently, I'm sure there are enough anarchists in the UK for us to occupy a piece of land and live as an anarchist commune, but we do not do this because although we could live autonomously it would not confer any great benefit to - and may even be at the expense of - everyone else. In an anarchist society I don't see what benefit anyone would think they could attain for either themselves or others by creating a forced hierarchy (I am sure you will disagree with this but I will return to it later). More importantly, I fail to see how one would be able to create such a situation from which one could exert forced authority over anyone else without their consent. If one was to say ""obey me"" others would say ""no"", and I don't understand why you believe someone could come into a position of having a 'bigger stick' then anyone else, as an anarchist myself I have complete faith in the general people's ability to organise themselves effectively without any coercion, and so it just seems that a society of free people who would allow someone to come to a position where they could exert power over the people just seems really silly of them.

I'll return now to the motives of one trying to create a 'structure with them on top' and I guess I can easily understand it from the point of view of the kind of culture we currently live in; to make a gross simplification of economics, capitalism is essentially a zero-sum game which rewards those who can make great personal gains at the expense of others, and so for some it's hard to believe that people could co-operate fairly without being beset by those seeking to dominate others, but I would argue that living in an anarchist society would convey to people a very different set of values. I personally don't believe that greed is an inherent human trait but rather something we are taught by the conditions in which we live, right now I've been raised in an environment that teachers me to strive to be better than others so that I can acquire more wealth than them, and that such wealth is desirable, rather than to help my community achieve the most that it can.

However, I'm not sure I agree with your points about the removal of people from the society. We currently live in a society which is not anarchic, and whose inhabitants are overwhelmingly not anarchists. Disregarding the problem of actually moving from this to an anarchic society (how can you claim the authority to impose a change from our current society to anarchy when your system by definition does not contain any hierarchical authority?), we're still faced with the fact that most people do not want anarchy, and are in fact very much in favour of our current system (I count myself among this group). The vast majority are not going to want to have to voluntarily leave, and would prefer to stay with the current system intact. I myself believe strongly enough that anarchy is not the way forward that I would fight for the current system, and I'm sure a great many others would too. What do you do with people like us who disagree so strongly? Submit, and return to an ordered society? Resist, and abandon your non-coercive, we're-not-going-to-force-you-to-leave policy?

As to the creation of structure within your anarchic society, are you serious? You can't see that some people might try to better themselves at the expense of others? Most people don't care about society as a whole, they are only interested in bettering themselves and those they regard as kin. People have always done this. Almost all animals do this. What makes you think this will suddenly stop? As to actually enacting this, we can start with the fact that some people naturally have stronger muscles than others, and work up an ""arms race"" from there.

I'm going to ignore the economic arguments. Partly because I didn't bring economics up to begin with, partly because arguing economics with someone who believes in such a radically different system from our own tends to degenerate rapidly to idealism (we'll have no common ground from which to build arguments the other person sees as valid), and partly because I really can't be bothered to get into it right now. Sorry...

Essentially, in summary, I think that your vision of anarchic society is flawed. It has always been in existence, and everyone in it was taught from a young age that anarchy is right, and fervently believes this to be true. I do not believe this is consistent with the real world, and I do not think your system is capable of effectively dealing with the possibility of elements within it working against it.

- I really, really like it. I think this makes /doctorwho/ a much better place to read. There's still fun and interesting images, but they are *directly related to Doctor Who*, and not just a bit of text on a meme-image. 

Things I definitely think *should* be allowed, to encourage community spirit, which might otherwise be mistaken for the disallowed criteria:

- Original artwork (not mass produced merchandise, but something the poster or someone they know created), including cakes, decorative items, and interior design (TARDIS closets etc.)

- Cosplay

Remember if you asked anyone on this board on June 1 what we should charge for Modric the answer you would have gotten would have probably worked out to somewhere in the 40-50m range.  Thats great if you can get it.  but we are seeing that there is only 1 team in the market for Modric and they don't seem willing to pay anywhere in that range.

Modric has made it clear that he doesn't want to be here, he has been a bit of a prat because of all this.  That means Levy would have to fight to get the best price he can and that takes time especially when you have limited to no market for the player.

If we set a hard time-frame like July 31 for the Modric sale where would that put us right now?  What happens when Modric says he is going on strike and won't play unless we sell him? This would completely fuck us, because then we would be stuck with a player who won't play for us with a limited market and each day he is unwilling to play his value drops because lets face it, Real doesn't have a desperate need for Modric and they are the only ones truly in the market for him at this moment, so why overbid for a player that won't play for his own team because they set an arbitrary deadline and won't negotiate?

I will say that the lack of a striker is frustrating as hell, the past 4 windows we have been looking for one and still haven't landed one.  This is the main issue i have with Levy, i get that we are looking for a CL calibre striker without CL and that is difficult at best but there has to be someone out there that we could have pulled in by now.

Even when some people don't want it to be, the information (which can be ideas, music, games or anything else) is passed around. It's been pretty much impossible to stop.

We also like stuff. The current capitalist system is based on the fact that we like new stuff, and aren't that bothered if it doesn't last long.

Having lots of 3D printers around in people's homes means when we're sharing new ideas, some of those new ideas will translate directly into stuff - without the intervention of The Powers That Be or advertisers or corporations. 

The way things usually work now is that someone comes up with an idea, they spend time getting companies to look at the idea, one of them takes the idea and turns it into stuff, and then they advertise the stuff and we work hard (possibly for those same companies) to get the money to buy it and the economy makes another turn of the wheel. 

If, in the future, someone comes up with an idea for new stuff and it spreads right around the whole world and is physically turned into stuff without the intervening steps of companies holding rights, advertising persuading us we want it, people having to work to get the money to buy it from the companies, that's going to change society.

I.e., a little community clubs together to buy a 3D printer, then anyone in the community who can provide the raw materials can have their own 3D printer, printed out by the communal 3D printer. Pretty soon, every man and his dog has a 3D printer. Granted, we are years (probably decades) away from multi-purpose machines that can print everything from your home maintenance hardware to your groceries, but there are already projects going on with specialist machines in various fields. Such as the [TED talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdbJP8Gxqog) recently doing the rounds on Reddit talking about 3D printed houses, or [printing meats and replacement organs](http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/smart-takes/investing-in-3d-printed-meat/28476). Tangentially related is [the Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/) project which provides plans on how to bootstrap a self-sustaining community from scratch.  
There exists [a method of disposing of waste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_gasification) where a by-product can be used as a construction material. How feasible that would be to use in a 3D printing process I don't know, but I would take that as an indicator that there might be ways of producing abundant raw materials that we haven't really thought about yet.  
So, what happens to the pursuit of wealth when wealth has lost meaning? Given that it's a sucker who buys an expensive item that came off a production line when he could just produce it at home on his own 3D printer for next to nothing. Then we start to move into an age of [post-scarcity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity_economy).  
If you're interested, [Ars published last year](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/04/the-next-napster-copyright-questions-as-3d-printing-comes-of-age/) an interesting article on how the coming 3D revolution may clash pretty hard with current copyright and intellectual property law.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; no the biggest thing is lack of champions league and the top names preferring other options.

People will come without CL play. It's the *idea* that would draw them in. Of course, we won't be signing on players of RVP's stature without CL play but players like Hulk, Llorente, Damiao, Moutinho, and others are still possibilites (possibilities in the sense that they would come, not that we'll buy them). You can build a very, very good team without the primadonnas that refuse teams without CL play.

&gt; no. the problem is he doesnt ""want"" to go to Tottenham more than he wants as much money as he can get.

I think that's a little cynical. He'll already be taking a huge wage reduction to join us, and is hoping to get a lump sum up front to make up for it. He could be on his way to Russia, China, or the Middle East if he really wanted money. But he wants to come to Spurs. That says something. The guy has hundreds of people that depend on his cash flow and, if he doesn't get that money he wants fron City, those are the people that will be lacking because of it. Ade can live without a new car or a new watch but those people depend on his wages very much.

&gt; no. had levy stuck to his word and honoured his gentleman's agreement modric wouldnt have had to protest. that agreement was partly made so that tottenham would receive a good price. levy is entirely to blame for this one.

This is very, very cynical and very, very wrong. Honoring his gentleman's agreement doesn't mean letting Modric go for less than half of what we value him for. He'll still let Modric go, just for a fee that we deserve. 

If Modric kept his mouth shut he'd have been with Madrid for a month now. If he came back from the Euros, moved back into the first team, and started playing while keeping his mouth shut about who he wanted to play for the bids could have come in from PSG, Chelsea, and others and we would have a good old fashioned bidding war.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"i agree that we should conduct the Modric deal faster, however setting an arbitrary deadline does nothing but potentially hurt us.

The Ronaldo deal is different because when Manu gave the ridiculous price, Madrid gave it to them. Hard to make the deal drag on when you say ""i want a kings ransom"" and the buying team agrees and gives it to you.

With Modric we said ""we want a kings ransom"" and Real has said no, ""but we will give you this much"", makes the negotiations a little different.

Modric knuckling down and being a ""good lad"" was fantastic for us last year, and i would hope he would do it again.  However we have already seen antics from him this year that he didn't do last year.  According to Modric's people he did knuckle down last year because of a ""gentlemans agreement"" i don't know if this is true or not, but if we didn't sell him because of an arbitrary deadline and pissed him off further that ""good lad"" will starting being a cunt as we decline dealing him because of a date.  Then we fall back into the ""what to do with Modric?"" conversations which becomes a huge fucking distraction.

I would think that you can do deals involving pivotal players into August, i wouldn't reccomend waiting until the last week to sell someone, but you can certainly still conduct business now.

We have apparently made and offer for Moutinho, problem is Porto's chairman is just as much a pain in the ass as Levy can be, so we are at 20 and he is at 24 so we are going to haggle over him for a little bit and probably settle in at 22-24 and get it done. 

Adebayor's deal is infuriating because it is not anything that Levy has done, he got the price settled, he got the wages settled he did his job...Ade then started pressuring Man City for a signing off lump of money and this thing has dragged on for way longer than it needed to.

Toss in the new coach, the tournaments and the missing of CL and it is going to make negotiations for other players of the calibre that we want a little more difficult.

On that note: Daleks need a redesign. Not the power rangers kind. Give them deeper and more varied voices like the Emperor Dalek and more threatening suits of some kind. A trash can with a high pitched voice just doesn't work for me.

So I'd suggest you read up on the late 60s-early 70s (City's golden age - Colin Bell is widely seen to be the greatest City player of all time). Then read about the Marsh transfer (the catalyst for our big crash). Get your head around the disaster that was the Peter Swales era. 

You have to be aware of the relegation to division 2, the amazing support we still had, and the incredible comeback against Gillingham. 

2008 was the start of the big money era. Read about Al Fahim to understand part of why we are so unpopular among neutrals. 

Of the current squad Vincent Kompany is Mr Man City.  There are flashier players on the squad but this man will become an all time City legend (if he isn't already).

This is a personal thing but I think its really important that you read about Manchester too, because it's a big part of what City represent. I'm from Manchester so I'm biased, but it's a great city that has achieved great things and City are the only team in Manchester - United are based in Trafford which is *just* marginally outside of the city. This doesn't matter to anyone other than City fans. The reason it matters to City fans is that were proud of our city and don't want it to be represented by a team that isn't based in Manchester.

If I recall I think **almost** every time the show brings up 'The Question' its is followed by a character asking another question starting with the word 'why'. I think this is a hint that the question is 'why does the universe exists' or something along those lines.

I believe this will be asked of The Doctor under circumstances that he must answer truthfully or die on the Fields of Trenzalore. I assume he will not answer the question because he knows it must never be answered and will die from it which will bring the end of the 11th doctor.

I think The Silence only exists to stop the question from being answered. They know that The Doctor will eventually have the answer but they do not believe he will give his life to not answer it. And that is why they are enemies.

The Tesselecta specifically said that Silence will fall when the question is asked, not when it is answered. Silence Will Fall or more appropriately Silence Must Fall is the mantra that The Silence follow in their attempt to stop the question from being answered.

i'm still guessing that the fields of trenzalore is going to be a court room and the ""no creature can speak falsely or fail to answer"" is going to be the doctor on trial, for crimes committed during the time war (or something like that). Somehow, the doctor's testimony in this ""case"" will lead potentially to the fall of the silence. Now, if the fall of the silence depends on his testimony in a case about the time war then we can assume that the reason we've never encountered the silence before is because they have some sort of affiliation with the timelords (if the doctor was able to figure out the silence existed, so could other timelords) or a creation by them. If the master's sole purpose for being since he was a child was to bring gallifrey and the timelords out of the time war on the final days of the war, then it's perfectly reasonable to assume that the silence could also be a tool of the timelords to try and pull themselves out of the timewar. again, this goes back to the idea that the doctor's testimony and speaking the truth during this ""trial"" will defeat this plan. in short, i'm guessing the doctor goes to the fields of trenzalore and is tried for war crimes. again, this is probably why he's always ""running"". he used to be running away from the timelords but with them all gone, what else could he be running from? And if you were on trial wouldn't you try and kill the person who stands in the way of your freedom? If this was RTD running the show i'd say it'd be a court of the shadow proclamation but considering moffet is smarter than that, and the use of the omega symbol, leads me to think that omega, who was exiled - and then presumably dead - wants the timelords back for some purpose. he did help in creating the timelords after all and i'm sure a god wouldn't be too happy if someone suddenly wiped out all of his creations.

this all of course line's up all too perfectly with the 50th anniversary of the show. all the pieces seem to hearken back to the original series. i would not be surprised if the 50th anniversary special is titled ""the fields of trenzalore"" since it sounds like it could be an episode title of the original series and the doctor on trial would be an excellent opportunity for him to represent himself in court and call himself as a witness, allowing the previous doctors who played the role to play their part in the anniversary. i'm sure there will be a line where someone will ask how he could call himself as a witness and he'll say how it's ""timey-wimey"" and all the fanboys on here will make dozens of posts about it with screencaps and animated gifs. omega will return. the timelords will potentially return, probably just in that episode but still return. 

it's all there in front of your face. if the silence are meant to stop the doctor and it's assumed that they blew up the tardis and created the cracks that wiped out things from time itself, you have to wonder who would want that to happen? especially so soon after the events of ""the end of time""? timelords. if they wipe the doctor out of existence then he doesn't exist to stop them from escaping the time war. he doesn't exist to lock them inside of the time war. one could assume that if amy never remembers him and his timeline keeps reversing it would undo everything that happened prior to amy meeting him, but she remembers and ruins that plan. now before people say ""but the cracks were caused by the doctor flying the pandorica into an exploding tardis"" you would be wrong. the light from the pandorica was a regeneration field. the cracks prior to that were deleting things from time. those 2 things are not the same.

You talked about the time lords returning and the silence being a tool to get them to return.

&gt;then it's perfectly reasonable to assume that the silence could also be a tool of the timelords to try and pull themselves out of the timewar

The other theories I read (on the page linked in the edit on the main post) wondered if the doctor's name was the pass code to some megadeathkill weapon. 


I don't believe that the Doctors name is the pass code to some megadeathkill weapon but what if he needed to use his name, his true name to active The Moment and seal the Timelords, Daleks and all other horrors inside the Time War. Now we know that the Timelords agreed to the Final Sanction where they would ascend to pure conscious beings. So what if the Doctor's name unlocks The Moment and the Timelords are released from the Time War to enact the Final Sanction.

You whispered my name in my ear. There's only one way I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could."" has been rather stupidly used to assume that it means he told her his name because they were married but the shock behind his reaction implies something other than that. it can possibly be the timelock on the timewar... if he locked it from the outside it stands to reason that he holds the key to opening it as well. locks work both ways. it could also mean something else but his reaction to river knowing his name was not one of joy or happiness. it seemed more like fear.

it's not the doctor's style to lock up some megadeathkill weapon when he would just outright destroy it.

Time war. Relatively unknown, and time locked. Also due to how they first treat the issue i believe at some point near the ""end"" of the war, the planet itself was also destroyed, however you measure time in a timewar, i can't say.


So for the same of us who can't time travel.

Lets say start of the war was A
and the ""end"" of the war is B

everything from A to B is off limits. IMPOSSIBLE to travel to.

What about before Point A?

This requires me to explain how i imagine timelocks work.

I imagine it does two things.

1) Make time travel between two dates impossible for an area.

2) everything within that timeframe becomes a fixed point, and risking changing that would create a paradox

[spoiler](#s ""This would summon time dragons to consume everything, or time would collapse and everything would happen at once until time itself died.

true,alister667,lfc68,,"Well I only got to see the highlights (lowlights?) on MOTD last night, but Agger and Skrtel looked very nervous with the idea of playing it out from the back. 

I think Rodgers needs to give them license to stick their laces through it if they're under pressure. Keeping possession is great, but giving possession away close to our own penalty area is very dangerous.

Borini or Carroll through the middle with Suarez out right seems like an improvement. Perhaps with Assaidi arriving out on the right Suarez might go out to the left. Downing doesn't look that comfortable in the new system. Lucas will take a few games to get his full match sharpness back.

There's a fairly convincing argument that we still need an out an out striker. I hoped that was Borini, but if that was so I'd prefer him to be played in the middle, not wide.

The problem I had with Dalglish's sacking was that last year was a rebuilding year. New players, new way of playing, new manager, new coaches, heck even new owners. It takes a team a while to get used to these things, to build consistency. Now with another change of manager, another wave of new players, new coaches, and entire new philosophy on how we play the game, we have another period of rebuilding ahead of us. I hope it won't take a full year for us to become consistent and effective, but I suspect we will need a lot of patience. I believe Rodgers' way is the right way, but it will take time for us to implement it. For Rodgers to build his team and get them playing how he wants could take a while. He has to be given that time, or next year too, will be another rebuilding year. ",0,1345369065,null,0,false,0,c5vfjxq,t3_yfxx1,t1_c5vfjxq,t3_yfxx1,null,1435690829,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

There are other examples that I remember reading, there have been many occasions where the House of Lords in its current form have protected the civil liberties of the people which the Commons have attempted to restrict.

I'm not for reform in making it elected, but reform (at least for now) such as giving them the option to retire if they so wish, that former MPs and especially the Prime Minister cannot sit in the House of Lords.

How were the suggested 15 year terms fair? The whole proposed reform was flawed. They wouldn't be held responsible for their actions as they couldn't be reelected after their first term, they could promise things and not deliver them, they could also challenge the primacy of the Commons as if they're both elected, why is one more legitimate than the other?",0,1345372043,null,0,false,0,c5vftg6,t3_yex9u,t1_c5vftg6,t1_c5vfkej,null,1429678274,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I would rather us keep a monarchy than go away and become a republic with a president or something similar, many people in this country cannot see how that would work, with a minority advocating such change away from it.

The monarchy is as relevant to the 21st century as it was 500, 1000 years ago. It's stupid saying that ""if the monarchy had never existed and someone proposed it today, people would reject it"" is useless, how do you know that? 

Our current monarch, Queen Elizabeth II is a unifying force for our nation, people love her and I'm sure they'll love William when he becomes King (got to admit that Charles won't have long on the throne, if he does).

You could argue we've already been a republic for that brief spell with Cromwell when the roundheads beat the cavaliers, yet a decade or two later the monarchy was reinstated.

The system then proposed would reduce the income tax rate to a flat 22%, and increase personal allowance from £4,435 to £10,000-£15,500. The idea of a flat tax is not included in the current Conservative party manifesto.


Each year between 2006 and 2009, Osborne attended the annual Bilderberg Conference, a meeting of influential people in business, finance and politics.

 Best example of this is Voldemort. Although his real name (Tom Marvolo Riddle) was easier to figure out, once Harry &amp; Dumbledore knew his name they went and explored his past (HP6) which lead them to horcruxes and helped Harry defeat Voldy in the end. 
So i think although the whole thing about 'the power of a name' that comes from mythologies ties in with DW it might be more about his past.

Now you're just being ridiculous. Forgetting for a second that Luiz actually *could* play midfield without being a complete disaster, Oscar actually HAS played central midfield before. Oscar is not nearly as tiny as Mata, so to say that bc Mata can't play CM, automatically means neither could Oscar, is silly. I'm simply saying it's too early to rule him out of any position in the midfield (aside from DM) as we don't clearly know his strengths yet. I honestly find it quite humorous that you're so quick to judge the type of player he is without knowing hardly anything about him.

true,Rukooo,lfc99,,"I think the big mistake was not playing Suarez on the left and letting Borini come through the center. If you buy Borini to score goals, why don't you put him where its the most possible for him to do so? But other thing that I don't like about Borini is his physical aspect in the game. When trying to pick him out, he will have to create a lot of space, because he will have a hard time beating big defenders to the ball in the air or even on the ground.

Another issue with goal-scoring in the system is the way we set out to play. If we do not have clinical strikers who attempt as many shots on goal as they can, we won't be scoring goals. This is because when you play a possession game, you give the defense time to organize. And lots of bottom-half Premier League teams like to play 4-4-2 which in terms of defense is very stubborn to penetrate. Thus, whenever we play the possession game you have a nice back 4 lined up in defense with the midfield 4 neatly in-front of the back four. As a result, the penalty area gets very easily compact and well defended and penetrating that will be hard as the back 4 will be so close to the goalkeeper that getting in-behind will be difficult.

Thus, in my opinion we need lots of 1 touch shots and not to over complicate the things that go on in the penalty area, as the crowded nature that Liverpool will force a lot of defending teams to defend very deep. B-Rod needs to work on first time finishes, lots of simple moves which ends up with a shot on goal.

As Davros says in the fourth season (new version), he takes the people around him and fashions them into weapons even though he carries no gun himself. I'm reminded of something from the Wheel of Time series of books, in which a general, thought to be one of the best in the world, makes a remark that a good general never uses the sword buckled to his belt. 

There are a lot of shows, movies, and stories in which the main character finally gets the bigger muscles or the better gun, or able to hit the three point shot at last, whereby he defeats the obstacle in his path. They can be great stories, but this evolution of the doctor towards a thinking man first and only has made him not only more dangerous and shifty, but something more spectacular and rare in storytelilng today.

This is a fan blueprint, and on top of it. due to the scale(KM SERIOUSLY), and the amount of floors, this interior would have close to or more interior surface area than the entire surface area of planet earth. Essentially it makes no sense.

Take the surface area of each floor, and you have an incredible amount of room.
You have the Radius of 800 to 1000km. 
one floor right in the center of the tardis has roughly 785398 m squared of space. Thats almost 1/500th of the surface area of earth. There are at least 250-300 floors in the main center sections. That means just in the main center blob, you are looking at roughly 3/5s the surface area of the earth. Then you have the extra sections to the top and bottom. This then doesn't include jettisoned capsules, nor does it take into account that it may not be perfectly round, and that it may be wider than the 1000 km in spots.

Also Tardis never stop growing. 

Why would anything ever need to be that big? Gallifrey was in no danger of over population. Time lords were only loomed/born when another time lord died. Why would they need planet sized ships. Not moon sized. Planet sized. 

The answer is they wouldn't their entire population could easily fit within 1 tardis. That would be like humans building an entire planet earth. There is literally no point.


If we, lets say... decrease the scale to 25% of what it is, then that makes it a bit more reasonable if still not overly large.

Mine (I read Maths at Wadham) spread over 3 days. The first involved the entrance exam - make sure you prepare properly for any entrance exam you might have to take. There are usually practice exams on your department web page - they are NOT like A-level exams (at least the maths one wasn't!). The next day was my interview in my college of choice followed by my auto-assigned second choice college the day after. Whilst you can prepare for the interviews be prepared for them being quite different to what you expect! My school hadn't sent anyone to Oxbridge for 20yrs so I didn't have much guidance beforehand (they set up a practice interview where I was asked about my opinion on Harry Potter. I remind you, I was applying for maths...). My best hint is to make sure you have read around your subject and know a couple of subject areas/books that interest you enough to talk about them. About half of my interview were problems (they don't expect you to be able to do them all immediately; they want to see how you work on problems) and the other half was talking about my interests in mathematics (and a little time on extracurricular activities too). Hope this helps!

TL,DR: the grades seem good enough to get you an interview - that is, IMO, where the decision on acceptance is really made.

These subconscious social queues are why most drug trials are done double blind where the doctor administering the drugs/placebos/alternative medicine doesn't know if they are giving the patient the active compound (or new treatment) or not.

Suarez is good at pulling defenders without the ball. Unfortunately, downing and Johnson got the ball on the wing and tried crossing it instead of holding possession and getting it to an open player. I think Suarez did a fine job in the center.

The problem is Borini belongs in the middle. He had zero chemistry with Johnson on the outside.

Yes you do get deaths at these festivals, there is a good chance of it happening.  Yes a lot of these get unreported.  MCD, the promoter of the Oxygen festival in Ireland has had injunctions with various media outlets to not report deaths or serious injuries on the site the past few years.  

Also, a lot of deaths happen off the site, ie. in a back of an Ambulance rushing to the nearest A&amp;E, thus not happening on the site of the festival, so it goes unreported and it's all ""clean"" in the eyes of the promoter.

I honestly can't see any techno-fix for climate change on the horizon, fossil fuel companies already have the equivalent of 2000-3000 giga tonnes of carbon on their balance books, we can't emit any more than 500 before torching the climate. You just have look at the frightening expansion of the tar sands in Alberta for a taste of the next 50 years. I have some high hopes that in the next 20-30 years the technology will arrive to really start making a dent in emissions. Higher efficiency (and cheaper) solar, the Polywell Fusion device, the travelling wave reactor. Even good old fashioned fission will get safer and cheaper (I like the look of GenIII+ reactors like the AP1000). But as these technologies reach maturity the damage will have already been done. 

It's just so fucking frustrating, because if you were to ignore climate change I have ridiculously high hopes for humanity. More people are being lifted out of poverty than ever before, the internet has allowed the free exchange of ideas and corrupt governments are getting overthrown as a result. Science, medical technology, engineering are all continuing to develop at a rapid pace. But the force of climate change will overwhelm our ability to adapt (at least for a large percentage of the world). We're trending on all the worse case scenarios, the arctic summer sea ice melt in the last 2 weeks has surprised even the most pessimistic climatologists.

The guy needs a rest. Torres underperformed as well; the only time he was in a good position he was offside. Mikel made some forward passes which was nice to see. Ivanovich was a rock at RB. Luiz did more good than bad. Lamps was average despite the penalty (he doesn't miss those very often, as we know). Though Bertrand has speed his control is questionable. I like that he's getting time on the pitch but left ""wing"" is not what he was meant to play, IMO. 

All in all I'm really looking forward to this season, especially with our new signings. If Mata can return to form and Torres can benefit from Hazard, Mata, Marin, and Oscar I think it's going to be a pretty good season for us.

A lot of people were saying that he looked really good, but I don't know... he seemed pretty average (at least for his usual standard) to me. I was at the game, so maybe he made a different impact on TV? I don't know.

As usual, his dribbling was great, but the end product was less so. I still don't think he's ready for chelsea.

_____

I hope Maloney's alright too, not just because he's an important player who made a big impact last year... but because I just can't stand Gomez.

...although if his overhead kick went in/was on target today, I wouldn't be as harsh to him :p

You might think she shouldn't be performing at festivals, but if you think she's calling the shots, and not her management, then you're a moron. If you don't like it, take the time to go and get some food, or drink, or have a piss, *in a toilet*.

I'm not a huge fan myself, but you've got to remember, it's hard performing in front of shit loads of people, especially if you know many of them won't approve (festival goers), and being sploshed in piss for your efforts, in front of them, and the cameras can't be a very nice experience.

I'd wager the piss lobbers would think twice about hurling their liquid disdain at the ''cool'' acts, even if they didn't like them (and let's not forget, plenty of ''cool'' acts chart), for fear of offending the ''cool'' kids, but it's okay to soak an albeit slightly obnoxious girl, because she's a *pop* starlet, and heaven forfend such an act appear at a massively hyped, and trashy festival.

Just my theory but it makes sense (in my head at least) because the question is supposed to be ""as old as the universe itself/the oldest question in the universe hidden in plane sight"" which suggests the legend/myth everyone knows but  thats so old no one believes it anymore (its like us and greek mythology for example) &amp; considering the question refers to the Doctor it suggests that the Doctor is more than 900 (Moffat stated in an interview that the Doctor doesnt know his actual age cos he travels in time in a non-linear way) kinda implying that he might be as old as the universe itself. (does my rambling make any sense??)

It's may be because he could lose his liberty in Sweden, and not be able to flee, if the US decide to come knocking? It may be due to a recent (first time in decades) visit to Sweden by the US Secretary of State. It could be the fact that Sweden has already shipped off people to countries where torture is happening. 

In Sweden, the public and media is generally against Assange, there's the language and legal barrier, and in terms of political clout, has less power than the UK in potentially opposing the US.

is the episode that starts off new Doctor Who. It introduces the Doctor and Rose who is the companion for the first two series. But it isn't the best episode imo and might put you off watching more Doctor Who.

**Smith and Jones(series 3)** 
introduces a new companion called Martha and is a better episode in my opinion. 

**The Eleventh Hour(series 5)** 
introduces a new Doctor and a new companion called Amy. Series 5 is a good place to start if you don't want to have to catch up on 50+ hours of Doctor Who! Although if you do get the chance its always worthwhile to catch up on it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"You make a good point about the limitations of these kind of statistics. Statistics like these especially remove so much of the context that they don't tell you all that much in terms of comparing player A vs. player B. However, I think for a lot of critics the whole ""Mikel always passes sideways"" thing is not just a figure of speech. Some people actually believe that Mikel only rarely plays forward balls and never plays passes more than 5 yds. I'll agree with you though that this is not any sort of well thought out criticism and doesn't really warrant serious attention. 

The thing about incisive passes though does open up a topic for further discussion. Is it because he is unable to or is it a risk assessment thing? Is it ability, style, or both? As a team do we really want Mikel trying to play like a regista or is it more effective for him to pass to Lampard or Mata or even an unmarked Luiz nearby? Maybe were just a bit disappointed that Mikel isn't the same caliber of a prime Essien, but who is?


My opinion on Mikel is that his style of play is excellent for when we are playing well. He supports the back 4, helps us gain shape and control by holding up play when we are being pressed, and he is very good at distributing the ball evenly to our other midfielders and forwards. When things are going poorly though  Mikel's style becomes frustrating. He's not going to suddenly take control of the midfield or start charging up the pitch. 

I thought he played well today too... He helped support the play and got us moving out of tight spaces and was generally pretty tidy. I do think it is weird how much hate he gets...I'm not sure what it is about us always needing some scapegoat or some player who ""isn't good enough for Chelsea"". I understand some people might prefer a different style of midfielder but to me that is a different thing entirely.

Did you have it data-tagged? That can make all the difference if it ends up with the right person.

Some advice:
*Even a basic alarm can save your bike and alert you when someone tries to move it. You don't need a fancy immobilise one for basic protection.
*Not all disk locks are equal - get a sold secure, preferably with an alarm on it.
*Flexible locks (I think that's what is in the pic) can be broken in seconds. A chain is much better, but a little more difficult to carry around.
*Datatag everything

true,ksturgis,null,null,"I think you make a pretty good summation of Mikel and the things he does well. For me I think the simplest way to put it is this: Mikel is a *defensive* Midfielder, and he plays this role pretty well. He is pretty reliable as a shield in front of the back 4, tackles well, helps clog the middle, and stifles the opposition attack with relative success. 

Honestly I think the fairest criticism on Mikel is that this is essentially all he provides to the team. Where people tend to disagree is whether or not it's acceptable that he only provides defensive abilities. Many people (myself included) would prefer to have a DM that is able to offer more of a presence going forward. I think Lucas from liverpool is a great example (I know I know, many consider him the best but the best often offer an example of what we should strive to achieve). Lucas not only provides wonderful cover in front of the back line, but is more than capable of advancing the ball forward in possession, and distributing the ball with effective passes that help slice open the defense. At the end of the day, Mikel isn't capable of carrying the ball forward effectively and cutting through the defense with incisive passes. So again it begs the question, *Should we expect that from our DM?* I think the answer unequivocally is yes. Because that kind of DM is more valuable to our midfield because he is more dimensional. He offers more on both sides of the ball. 

Edit: Let me be clear that in no way am I suggesting we should get rid of Mikel, or that he is not ""good enough for chelsea."" Again, he's a very capable defensive mid, but I think without question we could find someone who could do the job better.

true,spuri0us,irish,"Former Colony ","There is enough media reports on the internet if you would care to search.  You have the one today a V, but there is plenty of others.  Google ""&lt;insert festival name&gt; death"" and you are bound to find something. 

One that I was recently at back in July which caused a lot of controversy back in Ireland was the [Phoenix Park Concerts](www.thejournal.ie/phoenix-park-three-males-dead-swedish-house-mafia-overdose-513781-Jul2012/) where 3 people died and multiple stabbing incidents occurred.  Swedish House Mafia were the headliners which drew in a lot of idiots that misuse drugs. 

To go even deeper, for which I cannot provide any immediate proof is the death while transporting case.  These typically are not the responsibility of the concert provider and they generally don't report these.  The burden of reporting these comes to the care providers like the NHS.  You would have to sift through reports from the Coroners Court to establish a baseline number of these. 

We were providing cover to a small weekend festival (3,500 patrons) and over the three days we treated 90 people and of that 9 were transfered to A&amp;E (mostly minor but 2 time critical drug related calls).  It gives you an idea of the incident rate at these events.  I would not say these figures scale linearly for every festival, the demographic and the size all play factors.  Larger festivals would have a higher cases per 100 people rate if that makes sense.  Again your not going to find figures and history on this because these are kept between the planners, police and EMS providers during risk assessment. 


So if you want to stick you fingers in your ears and go ""la la la la, I can't hear anything"" and not believe any of this, well thats up to you.  One thing is for sure, that there is a lot more then meets the eye at these festivals.

&gt;The Doctor: There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky.  Oh, you should have seen it! That old planet... The second sun would rise in the south, and the mountains would shine. The leaves on the trees were silver, when they caught the light, every morning it looked like a forest on fire. When the autumn came, a brilliant glow though the branches...

Don't know why you'd say ""metalheads are dicks"" like it's some sort of badge of honour. Especially when IMO it's not true, I'd much rather chat to a random stranger at Sonisphere, Download or Bloodstock than at Leeds fest.  
Plus, in my experience, it's more the Leeds crowd than the Download ones who throw bottles in general (can think of a lot more bands who've been bottled off at Leeds/Reading than at Download).

I can handle getting kicked in the head by crowdsurfers, or a black eye from a slayer pit or whatever, that's just people having a good time, but there's literally no reason to throw a piss bottle, other than to be a dick to someone. 

I don't really care about Cher Lloyd, I just think it's silly to bottle anyone.

I'd have to look in to this, but I'm guessing that some towns/cities may only have one team, so it's probably not that unusual that you'd get large attendances when their playing at home. 

That and the population of Brazil is 196,655,014, that's almost 38 times Scotland (5,222,100) so you'd expect bigger crowds at all matches.


&gt;There are several football clubs based in Recife, such as Sport (39 times state champion and once national champion (87) and Brazil's Cup champion (08)), Santa Cruz the current 2011 State Champion (24 times state champion) and Náutico (21 times state champion and unique 6 consecutives).

It used to be my local because of two lovely employees who remembered you/gave free stuff and you could happily chat ~~to~~ ~~up~~ to for ages. The best feature is that they are open till 10pm, later than any other coffee shop (to my knowledge, though Pulp Fict opens late one or two nights for gaming). 

Artisan Roast is wonderful. The original (don't know the Bruntsfield shop very well) shop is in the new town/Leith Walk area. Plus points; they supply coffee to most of the best places, aka their coffee is damn good; they roast their own beans on site, so god damn it smells good; they use french presses as lampshades and have coffee sacks on the walls. All in all pretty cool. On the negative it's small, and often kinda uncomfy. Some of my mates complain about the hipsterness of some people there, but I've always found them nice to chat to, and no worse than in any other coffee shop (not a hipster myself, geek/ex-metal fan, honest).

There is a new place opening in the Old Town, I've been following them on facebook/reddit for a while, the Brew Lab. They've been open to ideas and seem cool, but they're not open yet, so we'll see.

Kilimanjaro, opposite Beanscene is nice, they're soups are amazing, but I rarely have coffee there, and they tend to get crowded quite easily (and the tables at the back of the shop are a bit rubbish). When doing my dissertation I'd alternate between Kili for food, and beanscene for coffee.

Maybe a better way to put it is it was too direct.

It's not a problem with Tennant, but with ten, with the writing that went in at the end. It bothered me, i don't like the direction they went with it. It failed to capture me like it does for a lot of people.
