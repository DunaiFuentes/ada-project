My original posts states:

&gt;I just dont see why its such an apparently horrific idea for people to pay a slightly higher level of tax and get a much better society in return.

This is not just referring to education but social policy in general. You cannot deny that there *is* a correlation between higher taxation and better GINI coefficient. One of the factors that is assessed in a GINI coefficient is the level of education the populace of a country has achieved.

 I never made any claim to high cost of university and better GINI? 

A cursory google search (why is it that youre relying on me to do all this legwork, I wonder?) reveals tonnes of studies on the benefits to society at large as a result of university education. While none of these reference ""free"" university education specifically, the majority draw the conclusion that the benefit to society is greater than the cost to the state, either by increased tax revenues, scientific and industrial research benefits and healthier living styles that reduce the burden on the state through healthcare, avoiding prison and the like.

Possibly, I dont really know enough about this to comment but ...

As Ive mentioned I think its more to unions being seen to be ineffective, and also to do with the perception of what a union is for being wrong.


I can offer anecdotal evidence.

A number of people in my work place think the union is only there to offer advice should they get in trouble at work, they know they can join the union at any point and get advice so join only when they need advice and then quit after things blow over.


I have seen the same people state that even if they were in the union they would not take parts in the strike as they wouldn't want to lose a days pay, complaining about the increase in pension contribution leaving them with less money.

Union action (in the context of this conversation) was described as idiotic and selfish because it is presumed (correctly or incorrectly) to harm the union without benefiting the members.

true,dayus9,eng-gloucestershire,Lincs,"If anything they transliterated it differently. 

The word is حلال and in countries that use Arabic-like script, the first vowel sound of that word is not written because it is a short vowel (like the a in bad, the e on bed, and there's also an o sound that is a pain to describe right now), so the written letters in native script are HLAL. 

When transliterating into our alphabet people do exactly what they should do, they take how they pronounce it in their own language and then do their best to use our letters to help us say it properly, they work phonetically. Look at the different ways of spelling Mohammad (Muhammad, Mohammed, Muhammad, Mohamad etc etc), they''re all right really because there's no real rule about how to transliterate into a different alphabet. it's all the same bloody name (محمد) just people using their own way of transliterating it into our alphabet. 

So what we have is a large list of countries who use the arabic script or one that comes from it. They're all different, have evolved over time, and have developed their own way of pronouncing words and they also have different accents, so they do the right thing and work phonetically. 

The same actually works when going the other way, I've seen the name Anne spelled as آن, ان and also عن sometimes. It's an English name, there's no really good way to spell it but to do your best and make it something that can be pronounced correctly the way YOU want it pronounced. 

Yes, halal is the main way that the vast majority of people in this country spell it in our alphabet, but I think it's a bit rich of us to start telling people how they should transliterate our way. Our own dictionaries give the Arabic root of the word when describing the origin of the word as we spell it in English, well that's the 'Arabic' way of saying it, so I'm not surprised people spell it differently.

Some of it's malicious, some of it's incompetent. It focuses power to the top. But it's all just natural reactions to things. There could be an over-arching plot that no one knows about, but there's no reason to believe this.

Similarly governments have to set aside tens of billions for decades, causing massive short-term budget hits for something which will take decades to build (sapping all political will). Compare this to say gas power stations, which cost only a few hundred million upfront and hundreds of institutions eager to underwrite them so they don't even dent government budgets (massive fuel costs but these are ongoing, not upfront).

Consequently only a half-dozen odd have been built in the entire western world since the 80's, and even those only thanks to politically-motivated government guarantees (energy security/environmental/employment reasons).

This is what people are worried about. As soon as you introduce the private sector, you are getting one step closer to an NHS which we have to pay for.

&gt; To be quite honest, something needed to be done about the NHS as our country just can't afford it.

Companies will only want to take on the most profitable sections of the NHS. This means that the government will still be paying for the most expensive areas, meaning if your arguament is running on the fact we can't afford it, with areas being privatised, the budget would be little changed. Plus to that you've got to add on the increased cost of bureacurary the government would have to pay to keep the public-owned sectors and the private-owned sectors in contact.

Also, if the hospitals were GP run, there would need to be more GPs, meaning more cost. The most effective method would be to hire people who actually have experience with medical care, and the area and it's needs, to run hospitals, not adding extra strain on GPs while increasing efficiency.

&gt;GPC chair Dr Laurence Buckman is expected to write to the profession tomorrow formally stating the committee's outright opposition to the health bill after members passed a motion on the new position at a GPC meeting yesterday.",0,1330542449,null,0,false,0,c3wari8,t3_q9zhh,t1_c3wari8,t3_q9zhh,null,1428442787,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The whole pre-determined path thing is a relic from his home planet, (which you will hear more about). That’s how he can travel from 2005 to 5 billion AD to 1869 and back to 2006 and yet not travel backwards in his own timeline - the TARDIS follows its own linearity.

&gt;You say it is assumed that you give the watch to your mother. Is there even a possibility for him not to do so?

He does, at one point, try to save people who were supposed to die in a fixed event, in a kind of ""I'm tired of having to watch so many people die, GRRR"" moment. But time promptly reasserts the ""correct"" pattern. 
There’s this whole “fixed point” vs. “time in flux” dichotomy. For the most part anything can happen… except when it can’t.  

""People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually—from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint—it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff."" – The Tenth Doctor.

true,MrsDupe,tennant,Tennant,"I agree with the review. I didn't love everything RTD did, and I will admit to being one of those Tennant fans who's having a hard time moving on, but I tried (and continue to try!) really hard to deal with ""The End of Time"" and accept the new Doctor.

I feel that one issue that wasn't addressed in the review was the altered Doctor/companion(s) dynamic. Maybe it's because he's traveling with a couple this time, but I feel like there's two shows sometimes. I haven't finished series 6 yet, but I get this impression of a lot of the episodes I've seen: episode starts in the TARDIS, something's happening and everybody goes back/forward in time/space. They split up. The Doctor does his Doctor-y stuff, and Amy and Rory do other stuff that is related to the Doctor's stuff but rarely in the same physical space. Then they get together at the TARDIS and have some angst. Roll credits.

It's an over-generalization, for sure, but it leads to something that I feel backs up the review's main point. Every time something happens to the Doctor*, Amy gets all upset about it, and I think, ""you don't even really hang out with him that much. Quit crying."" Amy and Rory seem to pop in and out of the TARDIS way more than other companions--if I'm not mistaken, 10's companions came aboard, had their adventures, and when they left they left. All of them did have rather permanent exits, but still.

I'm hanging in there, and hoping that I connect more with the next companion, but I feel that this review was pretty spot-on with a lot of its criticism.

true,limmyr,null,null,"Most cheap rented housing in London is arranged at the time, not booked weeks ahead. I suggest you book into a hostel/cheap hotel in London and go look at the noticeboards in the LSE, as well as the web and newspapers. Be aware that Craigslist scams happen here too. There is some security on the doors at the LSE but I doubt if it is difficult to contact some students on relevant courses.

You could look into hostels for longer-term stay.  Not currently being a student makes it slightly more difficult, but try people like [this](http://www.victorialeague.co.uk/) -- not the only place helping people from the Commonwealth, there is a big, comfortable but expensive hostel that I am trying to remember the name of. EDIT: Yes, i know HK is no longer Commonwealth, but assume people still qualify!

Employment exchange workers don't think of themselves as social workers, and won't be much use in advance. They possibly won't be much use anyway, as employers often prefer to go through friends of friends as a form of character reference.  Can you get contacts through the UoC alumni association?  Consider attending a church/temple of your choice in London for the contacts -- such places  have a strong  social dimension as well as religious.

I have heard some complaints about the difficulty of hiring Chinese speakers for restaurants etc as visas have become harder. That should be a cut above toilet cleaning (which I have done in my life, to add to my dish-washing/waitressing earnings -- and went on to a good academic career).

I would think that 18K USD will keep you until benefits kick in, which shouldn't be long as a UK national. Try the online [Benefits Advisor](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Diol1/DoItOnline/DoItOnlineByCategory/DG_172666) -- I sure hope you don't need them, but it is nice to know the UK won't leave you absolutely destitute.  If you don't have a National Insurance number, that would be a good thing to work on in advance.

EDIT: I wish you could carry straight on studying -- have you looked at resources like [this?](http://www.foreignstudents.com/universities/scholarships) But I guess you fall between categories. 

MORE EDIT: Do just ask the courses you are targeting if they have a source of funds that might apply. If you start showing an interest now, it may help to get on the course later.

Britain isn't a *poor* country, it's just an inequitable one especially in certain areas (London poor / rich divide, for example). Throwing money at that just filters it back onto the wealthy who don't need it. The solutions are more in thinking of smarter ways to do things than a lack of money.

I'm not disagreeing with you btw, I just like thinking of things in Bill Gates terms: £ / year of life saved (or, comparatively, £ / (year of life saved)*(quality of life improved) which might be a more relevant metric since we're not trying to get rid of malaria).

How many years does one british pound of aid buy an Indian and what percentage does it improve the median quality of life by? The problem with the UK is we are pretty good at programmes on the whole and I just can't see a lot of things to 'throw money at' where you get *big* ROI in terms of those two metrics.

I'm not an economist btw, just believe that we shouldn't waste resources - we should utilise them where they're most effective. And politically, as long as its not to a big detriment of domestic interests, I don't mind helping our friends and neighbours. I would personally happily forgo a quid I might have spent on 1/3 of a coffee if it saved someone's life.

By investing in the production of talent, creativity and services, the country invests in its own future.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;If I were to build up a company and completely work my arse off 12 - 13hour days, then read about my sector for another 2 or 3 hours before bed and wake up and do it all again just because I had the belief I could become rich, and because of that I become rich, who the fuck would you be to be able to tell me I did it 'off the backs of workers' who I'd employed for 8hour shifts who went home to get drunk/do whatever the fuck they wanted?

What you're describing above is labour (of body and mind), I'm a socialist and therefore I believe in people receiving the full fruits of their labour.  When you do the above you're acting as a worker, not a capitalist.

&gt;Or even if I was a banker who studied his arse off, went to Oxford or Cambridge and worked just as hard, who would you be able to tell me I don't deserve that money? 

Even old Marxie boy was quite comfortable with the idea that labour price reflects time and opportunity expended in education and training (on the other side of the equation - there are plenty of reasons to go to Oxbridge besides racking up a heap of currency).  Incidentally, nowhere in my post did I mention telling anyone anything, certainly not in the sense of how much money they deserve - I think the market should determine that (just not the twisted and hopelessly rigged capitalist one).

&gt;The bankers earn as much as they do because if they didn't they'd go into other private companies to make near that amount. We need to keep these people in our banks so they don't completely fail and the whole country doesn't grind to a halt. 

This is mostly bankers' propaganda applied liberally over the generations and regurgitated almost verbatim.  In truth the banking monopoly is one of the worst, if not the worst aspect of capitalism.

&gt;The women who go into clean that office (cleaners) and earn maybe 1/100th of that, earn that because anybody can do their jobs. 

But only they actually get their hands dirty and do it, it is an unpleasant task few would choose given genuine freedom.  And subjective disutility would certainly to be a large factor in any genuinely free market.

&gt;'Socialist' attitudes will NEVER become a 'mainstream' thing, or the majority point of view in this country.

I don't know how old you are or how much history you've read, but socialist views were a ""mainstream"" thing in this country - before they were sold out by the political class, propagandised out by the chattering liberal class and driven out by the increasingly greedy and self-destructive capitalist class.

&gt;I'm happy with the fact that I know I can work my arse off in any sector and become rich. 

Ah, the Western dream.  And yet 0.36% owns 66% of the land (and 0.01% owns the vast majority of this), and the situation is barely different with other significant sources of wealth.  We tend to focus on incomes which are less significant, just as we talk about how small businesses dominate the numbers and ignore that they represent but a fragment of the wealth - most wannabe capitalists are capitalist wannabes and apologists for the system, not the wealthy industrialists on their way to the big time they imagine themselves as.",0,1330557593,null,0,true,0,c3wdu8i,t3_qb84q,t1_c3wdu8i,t1_c3wbeqf,null,1428444298,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Except I'd be more aggressive about driving it towards PR. So that you have 70% of seats FPTP and then the remaining 30% are allocated so as to best even out the house. Every party that is already over its proportional share gets nothing from the list. You work out how many seats each of the parties that are under represented get and divide the remaining seats proportionally on that basis.

It won't be perfect but it will be a hell of a lot better and maintain direct representation.

On the stable government front. That takes more work. There are multiple options available. One is to actually have a directly elected government and let them work with parliament as best they can as in the US. Another is just do coalitions as German and co do.
