Hopefully when Lucas is back to full match fitness and sharpness we'll see an improvement here. Starting Allen, Henderson or Sahin beside Lucas could improve things somewhat too as they would sit in front of him and push forward only to offer support, Gerrard could be the more advanced of the three in the attacking midfield role (it's been said a million times but he really is more suited to that role) and he wouldn't have to worry too much about moving forward into the box as there would be two players on midfield covering. Those two midfielders should really be sitting in midfield ready to press the opposition and get the ball back, at the moment it is only one player and it's leaving us exposed.

Our full-backs pushing very far forward don't help the centre-backs either and can leave them very exposed, on a counter attack for example one of them might have to move slightly out of position to cover and if there's no support from midfield, things could get messy.

Giggs and Carrick were outplayed by McCarthy and McArthur, forcing Rooney to drop back and play deep into midfield to compensate. This isolated Chicharito, who was predictably ineffective having to play 1 vs 3 at our back.

Since there's a quick turnaround to Tuesday's match, I expect Man Utd to make multiple lineup changes from the West Brom win. Chicharito would be my guess up front with Van Persie in support and I anticipate Giggs, Scholes, and Ferdinand may see the starting lineup as well. With that sort of lineup, a repeat of last year's performance is certainly a possibility.

The key to the match is Emmerson Boyce against Evra or BÃ¼ttner. Both of the United LBs like to make risky ventures forward.

Who says United or City won't go through a slump at some point or stop scoring so many late equalizers and winners; was there not a thread here a few days ago showing Chelsea on top of the table if it wasn't for those late goals? There's also the possibility of injuries (not that I want that, but it happens)- its a long season. That said, Chelsea must continue to improve their form, which it looks like they are, and depth could be an issue, so maybe a key transfer or two in January, but its certainly feasible.

It's in my direct interest that you don't smoke, don't drink, do exercise etc. I don't really want a country where the government is telling me what to eat and drink and telling me what I can't do with my own body.

Nobody wants US style healthcare - not even the Americans. And the US isn't a good private system either. Check out Germany, Japan or Taiwan which have arguably better systems than the UK and they are private. Nobody dies in the streets because they can't afford care in any of those places. The US is a terrible (and unique) example because it isn't really private - they run a mixture of both and in fact spend more taxpayer money per person on healthcare than we do!

Just food for thought anyway. I'm just saying that having the NHS isn't a good argument for why someone should HAVE to wear a helmet if they don't want to.

I also find the government's site sorely lacking, compared to almost all others, yet I'm forced to use it to 'prove' something.

I'm all for making sure the jobless look for work, but this has gone too far, in making people apply for multiple jobs each week, regardless of whether there's anything available that's suitable.  

It just leads to employers being spammed with hundreds of applications, just to make those in work feel better somehow that the unemployed aren't being 'lazy' as the papers would have you believe.

The plan coming in to enforce a 35 hour week of job searches sounds great to Daily Mail readers, but if I'm honest, I can check all relevant job sites in about an hour a day.  Of course, there's local papers to check, store windows when I'm out, etc, etc, but I can guarantee I'd be wasting my time.

Also, volunteer work, training, and further education, none of these count for anything while jobseeking, despite all of them being ways to get into a better job, hopefully one where I'll need no benefits at all.

Volunteer work especially, I'm helping at a local job club, teaching people to use PCs and the internet, helping them with CVs, jobsearches and the like, and I get zero credit for it.  if I'm forced to 'job search' for 35 hours a week, I can't see me wanting to carry on with that too.

1. It's not an equal union, with one nation having 80% of the votes, representatives, etc. That wouldn't be an issue if the nations of the UK had similar political views, but they don't. The party (mainly) ruling our country at the moment has 1 MP in Scotland, 8 in Wales and 0 in NI. That's 9 out of 117, and even including the LDs it's only 23 out of 117. I believe that the right-wing views of England are holding back social development in the other nations.

2. Our political system is extremely outdated; a break up would provide an opportunity to wipe the slate clean. FPTP should have died long ago. The purpose, and the need for, the House of Lords needs to be examined closely. The role of the Monarchy should be clearly defined rather than it theoretically having supreme power, but not using it. Basically reform of everything we keep around due to 'tradition', usually at the expense of democracy. I'm not keen on living in a museum.

3. Even if the UK was reformed into an equal and fairer union, if we are in the EU there is no point to the UK. Within the EU there are enough countries of varying sizes that no one country has final (and only) say. In addition to that, the small countries have their representation 'boosted' to prevent their voices being drowned out. The nations of the UK would have more influence separately than together.

On the other hand, UKIP represent a nasty populist shift in British politics.

true,mysterx,null,null,"I'm continually intrigued by the attitudes of people who have only watched the new series. Doctor Who has been many things in the last 50 years. From 2005 to 2010 it was... bubbly, cute, overly epic, fun and yes scary at times. Since Matt Smith/Steven Moffatt took over it's been different. I prefer it greatly myself. While I appreciate Russell T. Davies' era and what it's done for the series as a whole, I do find it far too twee and excessive at times (and I am a little miffed by people who seem to obsess over the Tenth Doctor to the point of ignoring all others).

Case in point I just watched the third ever serial 'The Edge of Destruction'. In it the TARDIS breaks down knocking out The Doctor and his companions. You may have heard of Colin Baker's portrayal of the Sixth Doctor as unlikeable but it has nothing on William Hartnell in this story. He flat out accuses his companions of causing the problem and schemes to kick them off the TARDIS. However in due course things are resolved and everyone's happy. This is NOTHING like the Doctor Who we had 7 years ago, or this year, but it is Doctor Who and it's great (and on a side note I don't think the Dalek's have been anywhere near as effective in the new series as they were in the classic era, especially with the overt armies of CGI).

In my case, that is because I do not recognise a single european Demos, from which we can perceive a sufficiently converged set of common aims and expectations. This is necessary for me to have confidence that any common governance will be [both] representative of, [and] accountable to, my needs. In short, I would not consider it legitimate.

So, I will be delighted to remain part of the EU as long as we remain a sovereign nation-state, but if there is no room for this in what will emerge from the euro-crisis as a converged euro-core then I will sadly vote to leave the EU when the referendum arrives.

The problem is not theoretical, it derives from an ECB massaging a consensus opinion from eurozone nations, on fiscal matters governed by the EBU, which then becomes a fait-accompli to britain (and sweden) via qualified majority voting. That is not a sovereign nation-state, that is a Sanjak such as Greece was and is again today.

The problem is not new either, it has been recognised since at least the time of Gladstone:

""The finance of the country is intimately associated with the liberties of the country. It is a powerful leverage by which English Liberty has been gradually acquired â¦ It lies at the root of English Liberty, and if the House of Commons can by any possibility lose the power of the control of the grants of public money, depend upon it, your very liberty will be worth very little in comparison â¦That power can never be wrenched out of your handsâ¦ That powerful leverage has been what is commonly known as the power of the purse â the control of the House of Commons over public expenditure â your main guarantee for purity â the root of English liberty. No violence, no tyranny, whether of experiments or of such methods as are likely to be made in this country, could ever for a moment have a chance of prevailing against the energies of that great assembly. No, if these powers of the House of Commons come to be encroached upon, it will be by tacit and insidious methods, and therefore I say that public attention should be called to this.""

Although, I hadn't really sat down and watched any of Nine's episodes (Except the first two) until the beginning of this week, but that was because the only episodes being shown at the time by my cable provider where mostly of Ten's entire run as the Doctor. Also, I was a bit reluctant to see less Tennant in the series anymore because I had grown attached. But, no, his episodes have shown to be quite enjoyable. The Empty Child is now close to the top of my favorite episodes, and The Doctor Dances really caused some feels man. Anywho, while watching an episode of Nine's I was thinking about how the show seemed so much more relaxed and playful than any of 11's and the end of Ten's. Now, Eleven is my second favorite doctor but his seasons, especially the most recent ones, have been hurting my head a bit. And I am not a big fan of having some of the show happen in certain ways just for plot convenience.

Even with my disinterest in brain hurting flippy-floppy events, I still thoroughly enjoy the series as a whole. The Snowman was a good episode, even if Eleven was a bit depressing at first (I guess understandably with the loss of Amy and Rory), and I started bawling and shaking my fist at Moffat at a certain part.

There is a lot of genuine reasons to not like the EU rather than those silly headline makers. As an organisation it is a step backwards for democracy, and is actually has a high level of corruption. They are obsessed with forming some super-country, and anything that gets in the way is swept aside (such as democracy in Ireland and Italy and basic human living conditions in Greece). Just look at the reactions of the EU commission, when the UK suggested it should maybe have a referendum. In addition their economic decisions even make the Torys look like the experts.

&gt;Just look at the reactions of the EU commission, when the UK suggested it should maybe have a referendum.

What backlash?

&gt;They are obsessed with forming some super-country

I wasn't aware there were plans afoot to have the EU made into a single country. That's actually quite worrying. Have you got any more info on this?

&gt;Actually we currently have just as much say as anyone else (interesting that you percieve us not to though). In that sentance you sum up the EU's attempt to keep control over us. It's blackmail, either you stay with us or we'll screw you. That doesn't sound like something I want to be involved with. 

It's not blackmail. If you want to leave a club, you can't expect to have any say over the what happens within that club. That's just basic common sense. They'd even still give us all the benefits of the club. That's a fucking long way from blackmail.

&gt;But I value our sovereignty and democracy far more than membership to some trading club. 

I just value pragmatic solutions. Sovereignty is just a bit of a pissing contest. We've got sovereignty in our own banks and currency where it matters. We've even got it by being a part of the EU. If we left the EU, we'd have even less say over the rules. We can pay a fee to join the EU, but I'm not sure we'd even need to. But if you want to be in the free market, you need to abide by the rules. That's not blackmail. That's perfectly reasonable. But how can you say we'd have sovereignty when in order to remain part of the free market we'd have to obey rules which we had no say in? I really don't see how having less say over the rules you are governed by, means you have more sovereignty?

&gt;But I value our sovereignty and democracy far more than membership to some trading club. 

You've got to be a realist in some instances. Money makes the world turn round, we live in a capitalist society. Capitalism has pushed the human race further than any other system, and has put food on the table. The British people need to put food on their own table. Having access to trade enables people better access to markets. It's better for small business, it gives people the chance to work hard and make something of themselves. You can put obstacles in the way of that if you want, but to do some in the name of sovereignty seems intellectually dishonest, and I don't think I understand the democracy angle, so feel free to fill me in on that.

true,hemo_jr,null,null,"So, above, when you said that the full conversion was done by hand, how would that work?  I see even less of a potential for a plunger and an egg whisk to do the work than a nanocloud. A nanocloud, with each bit working on a molecule at a time can pretty much do anything.

Also, I am envisioning a conversion that results in a baby Clara. This could be done in the inside and would not result in a dead girl. And I envision a basket outside a foundling home in 1866 with a note saying, ""Please take care of baby Clara Oswin Oswald.""

And I think you may have uncovered a plot hole. Why hasn't the Daleks attacked the Earth with a nanocloud? Could be that it goes against the grain of a Dalek to attack that way.  It does strike one as a bit too subtle for the Dalek persona. 

But if there is a logical reason why a nanocloud only works on the Asylum, it should be possible to duplicate whatever it needs, elsewhere.

The Doctor did call it both a nanocloud and nanogenes.  So you are contradicting the Doctor?

So what are the physical/mechanical limits to a nanocloud?  I don't see any.  A nanocloud consisting of 500 trillion individual parts with raw materials placed strategically could do anything.  And even if the raw materials weren't strategically placed, they could be transported over distance one molecule at a time.  It would just take longer.

The Tardis does things that the Doctors needs.  The Doctor needs to have fun.  The Doctor needs to save the universe.  The Tardis will do things to facilitate that.  These things usually consist of simple travelling to where the Doctor needs to go, but there are no stated limits to what she will do. The fact that the Tardis hasn't done something yet does not preclude it from doing it in the future.

As far as the teleport platform, you have already pointed out one plot hole.  But if the Daleks have a teleporter, why not the Tardis?  The Tardis lets the Doctor think he is in charge and saving himself &amp; the Ponds by teleporting out from the platform.  but the Tardis could have its own teleport system that merely needs to lock on coordinates.

Rangers and Celtic soak up all the football money in Scotland but they don't really have the competition or interest from foreign players. Hibs &amp; Hearts are probably the 3rd &amp; 4th biggest teams (not sure in what order). 

Hibs and Hearts are widely supported. It's common for there to be a family link with the family team going back generations and you'll find supporters of all ages. They're historically catholic &amp; protestant respectively, but it's not really all that relevant anymore, much of the bigotry is soaked up between Rangers &amp; Celtic.  

It's maybe surprisingly common how many people primarily support a Scottish team but also follow an English one, if perhaps just to have an interest in the Premiership. This can be a bit of a dirty secret and not everyone who does this will confess to it. Newcastle is maybe a good choice because there's a good train link, they have really good football culture and anyway Geordies are a likeable sort. 

Beware that going to games and buying shirts etc is expensive. Just getting it on TV can be expensive as you'll want Sky Sports, though most watch it in the pub. 

Rugby is also quite big here, it's not so obviously prevalent as football but the ""6 Nations"" and World Cup are big.

&gt;If you said to any one sixty or more years ago that Europe would be united and free of war between it's states at any point in the next couple of centuries, that person would have said you were mad and it happened. 

Oh, please.  *Come on*, surely you don't believe this type of nonsense?

Firstly, *Europe hasn't been free of war for the past ~sixty years*.  It was only four years ago that Russia invaded Georgia, it's as little as thirteen years ago that we were busy bombing Yugoslavia and there were plenty of conflicts throughout Europe since 1945.

What you meant to say was 'Western Europe would be united and free of war', which is on the whole true but to assign credit to the EU is simply ridiculous.  Since the end of the Napoleonic wars the only Western European wars were against Prussia/Germany and at the end of WW2 they'd been utterly decimated in terms of military power and they've been prevented from becoming one ever since, which has nothing to do with the EU.

It's funny really because if you look at the European conflicts over the last two hundred or so years the vast majority of them involve a fight for independence against a foreign empire or a fight for a more liberal system of government (e.g. Democracy/Socialism &gt; Monarch/Emperor).  Yet with the EU we have what basically amounts to the construction of a pan-European empire that aims to turn everyone into 'Europeans' as opposed to their traditional nationalities.  

One could definitely argue that the future of the EU has civil war written all over it.

Anyway, the point I'm making is that the EU is absolutely not responsible for peace in Western Europe.

Unfortunately, since S Club were entirely manufactured, I'd think even touring (and definitely their merch) would have been taken out of their hands so their return from that would have been much smaller also.

I'd wager that the only way to get long term rich from something like this is to get to a position where keeping you in will make more money than letting you go and negotiate your way to serious money.

true,RomanAbramovich,RU,russia,"**MOTM - Lampard.** My other option was Cech for saving our arses every 3 seconds but sadly he went off at half time. In my opinion, Lampard played a very important leadership role today, and his goals were both beautiful and critical. Please don't let him go, real Roman :(

**The passing is sloppy.** From the start we were under pressure from Everton and our passing accuracy suffered. It was Hazards poor pass which was intercepted which led to their goal in 63 seconds. The passing didn't get any better from there and we kept giving away possession far too easily via interceptions from poorly place passes. We didn't even need to be tackled to lose the ball!

**We're physically too weak.** Watching how we conceded that first goal, there is a great burst of pace down the right wing by Everton, and as the ball is crossed in Dave is pushed off the ball far too easily. This isn't a one off, this happens every single game. With the influx of small, speedy, skilful players we've really lost a lot of the bulk we need in order to defend and hold up the ball. It's only when Ivan, Mikel and Moses play that we really see some strength.

**Luiz for CDM?** Today he had to go in the position due to injury and he was our only defensive option for the CM position. In my opinion, this wasn't the game for him. He hasn't had enough experience in that position to properly defend the midfield, and we needed his pace in the back four to chase back. I really haven't made up my mind on this one, but I'd like to see him play more of the lesser games in that position before he plays the Top 8. Fellaini anyone?

**Torres had some good movement, but horrific finishing.** Torres was getting a lot more space and making the runs we needed him to make (even if he was still playing Quasi-Winger) but his finished, for a CF, was some of the worst you'll find. Every shot on target he made (even the one where he was offside) was aimed straight at the keeper. He may as well not hit the ball. That chance wasted in the 90th minute was not ruined by good defending, it was terrible attacking. I'm liking these rumours around Ba.

**If Cole really does go, I want Baines.** It's English for English which is a good start. Baines was probably second only to Jelavic in putting pressure on the defence. I don't see Bertrand really stepping up to the plate for a while, but Baines is already a great player who would make an instant impact. 

**Turnbull wasn't shit.** Not really much to look into here because he's only our backup now and he isn't our future 1st with Courtois in the ranks. It was nice to see him come off of his seat and actually put a good performance in.",0,1356881008,null,0,false,0,c7o9l8e,t3_15ob1j,t1_c7o9l8e,t3_15ob1j,null,1430807758,26,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,26

true,Quazz,capaldi,Capaldi,"&gt;So, above, when you said that the full conversion was done by hand, how would that work? I see even less of a potential for a plunger and an egg whisk to do the work than a nanocloud. A nanocloud, with each bit working on a molecule at a time can pretty much do anything.

Obviously those that do the conversion aren't necessarily Daleks themselves. They could be their little human puppets, after all.
The nanocloud wasn't programmed for a full conversion because most of the time, the Daleks wouldn't want that to happen. Plus, why bother to reprogram it every time you want to do one when you got slaves who can do it manually, anyway? 

&gt;Also, I am envisioning a conversion that results in a baby Clara. This could be done in the inside and would not result in a dead girl. And I envision a basket outside a foundling home in 1866 with a note saying, ""Please take care of baby Clara Oswin Oswald.""

Fair enough, although it was never mentioned that she was an orphan. And an orphan becoming governess? In Victorian times? It all seems to get more far fetched, really. On the other hand, I do think this brings up an interesting point in that we know nothing about her parents. Why the Doctor didn't even bother to check that is beyond me.

&gt;And I think you may have uncovered a plot hole. Why hasn't the Daleks attacked the Earth with a nanocloud? Could be that it goes against the grain of a Dalek to attack that way. It does strike one as a bit too subtle for the Dalek persona.

I think they find it more a means, than an end. They use it only as a tool to get what they want, not a way to win their war. 

&gt;But if there is a logical reason why a nanocloud only works on the Asylum, it should be possible to duplicate whatever it needs, elsewhere.

Maybe, but it's a relatively new concept and it's introduced late in their time span. It's possible they might do so in the future.

&gt;The Doctor did call it both a nanocloud and nanogenes. So you are contradicting the Doctor?

I feel half the time he doesn't even know what's going either, really. He just doesn't like seeming ignorant, on the other hand. But it suffices to say that a nanocloud is just a big collection of nanogenes. 

I'm not disputing the terminology, I'm merely saying it's an entirely different brand of nanogenes. Just like there are different cars.

&gt;So what are the physical/mechanical limits to a nanocloud? I don't see any. A nanocloud consisting of 500 trillion individual parts with raw materials placed strategically could do anything. And even if the raw materials weren't strategically placed, they could be transported over distance one molecule at a time. It would just take longer.

To the ones the Dalek uses? It takes a lot of time to convert the subjects. Compare that to the one back on Earth, which was arguably much smaller, and the difference is quite astounding. 

&gt;The Tardis does things that the Doctors needs. The Doctor needs to have fun. The Doctor needs to save the universe. The Tardis will do things to facilitate that. These things usually consist of simple travelling to where the Doctor needs to go, but there are no stated limits to what she will do. The fact that the Tardis hasn't done something yet does not preclude it from doing it in the future.

I'm not saying the TARDIS absolutely cannot have anything to do with it, I'm saying that from what we know there's no reason to suspect she plays such an active role. Mostly because she physically can't (as has been explained countless of times by the Doctor). If she could... She could have simply refused to take Rose back to her time. Or bring her back to the Doctor afterwards when she asked so that she could save the Doctor. In fact. If the TARDIS could play such an active role, then the show would become stole. You'd have a constant Deus Ex Machine ready to save the day for you every single time. 

&gt;As far as the teleport platform, you have already pointed out one plot hole. But if the Daleks have a teleporter, why not the Tardis? The Tardis lets the Doctor think he is in charge and saving himself &amp; the Ponds by teleporting out from the platform. but the Tardis could have its own teleport system that merely needs to lock on coordinates.

The Doctor is brilliant with teleports. And why would the TARDIS hide it? Surely, she wouldn't hide something that could help the Doctor in such a brilliant way. This would, again, be a perma Deus Ex Machine. About to get shot? TELEPORT! About to explode? TELEPORT!

&gt;Its not like the doctor knows all the ins and outs of the Tardis. He doesn't even take the brake off when he pilots it. The guy is kind of technophobe and techno-ignorant. And the Tardis is bigger on the inside.

Not really true. Unless you'd like to suggest every single Timelord leaves their brakes on, that is. 

River Song was just messing with him. 

The TARDIS may be bigger on the inside, but from everything we've seen, the Doctor knows it inside out. ",0,1356881396,null,0,false,0,c7o9nj2,t3_15mlu1,t1_c7o9nj2,t1_c7o8u7h,null,1430807784,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Moffat did indeed ratchet up the idea of a story arc, which screws up a lot of episodes as standalone stories. If you don't watch all of the episodes, and in order, then there are many things thrown in your face that don't make sense. 

One might argue this makes the show more compelling and increases viewership. It also turns away casual viewers. You need to be dedicated, or you'll be irritated.

I find the show harder to pitch to friends. In the Tennant years, the story arc was background noise, easily missed until you yelled, ""Oh! Aha!"" in the series finale and you realized hints had been dropped all along in various episodes.

also, if you are equally a fan of Harry Potter as well, you could go to the Warner Bros studio: http://www.wbstudiotour.co.uk/

If you want more general London sights I'd say stick with the basics - London Eye, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace. The whole South bank area is right on the Thames: cool markets, sights like the Globe theatre, nice pubs on the water, pretty cool stuff. 

Off the beaten track theres Abbey Road if you are into the Beatles.

and just for fun, theres the Absolute Ice Bar right off of Reagents street ;)

After the Tennant specials that ended his run, Russell T Davies left his role as the showrunner and moved on to focus on Torchwood. He also took basically all the production staff with him. Steven Moffat took over with a whole new crew and you can definitely tell that the show has changed because of him. Story arcs have existed in the entire new series, but Moffat is devoting more time to them and making them a bigger part of the show. I think he also has more of a master plan about where he wants to take the show than Davies ever had. 

I'm sure in a few years, Moffat will kill off a beloved character in a way that's awful and a crazed fan will snap and murder him. Someone else will be made showrunner and the show will change again.

Lampard is kind of the same (though maybe more because of mobility), and combined they let Pienaar and Osman wander into very dangerous positions.

On the flip side, after a ridiculous decision to start 4-3-3 with Mata RW (vs. Baines, woof) and Ramires RCM, Benitez had the wherewithal to revert back to 4-2-3-1. Ramires at least tried to limit Baines (but not as successful as Stam last week who limited Baines to only 2 (!) crosses). It's too bad we couldn't go 4-3-3/4-1-4-1 since we would have been able to control the midfield better, but we also didn't have the personnel for it on the field.

Baines is the best full-back crosser of the ball in the world at this moment. He's not far behind Marcelo in breaking into the box, either.

true,Xlator,null,null,"EDIT: You can most likely find a brief description of every comedy show listed here by myself and others on the [British Comedy Guide](http://www.comedy.co.uk)

If you're into true British situation comedy, you need to get back to the 80s and 90s roots. The old stuff is hard to beat. Stuff like The Young Ones, Blackadder, Bottom, Father Ted (more Irish really, but still counts ;)), Chef! and Red Dwarf spring to mind. New(er) stuff in the sitcom area that I personally enjoy and would highly recommend includes Spaced and Black Books, and currently running favourites are Peep Show and Not Going Out.

Also, Fresh Meat. Just got through it, two series so far, all in one go because I couldn't fucking stop watching. Written by the same chaps who created Peep Show, it's a comedy drama about six university students who end up living in a house together. One of the guys from The Inbetweeners is in it, sadly the least compelling and worst written and acted character out of the bunch. All the other main characters are very well developed, compelling and relatable, if not always likeable. The show strikes a good balance between comedy and tragedy and has some extremely well-written character drama, and often goes from being achingly funny to highly dramatic in a heartbeat. Definitely one of the better television series I've seen in recent years. Some people make it out to be Peep Show 2.0, and while the humor is at times similar the shows' characters, premises and plots are really worlds apart. Please do watch both and decide for yourself though, because they are both absolutely excellent TV.

There are also older sitcoms which are quite different (definitely cleaner) but still worth a look, like Dad's Army, Porridge, Open All Hours and Steptoe and Son (see Sanford and Son, proof positive that the yanks doing poor ripoffs of our shit is no recent thing... ;))

If you enjoy sketch shows, then for fuck's sake don't miss Not the 9 O'Clock News, Harry Enfield's various shows, Harry and Paul or The Fast Show. (Or Monty Python, of course, but who hasn't seen THAT? ;))

Britain also has a tradition of great comedy panel shows, though I've tuned most of them out after living abroad for 12 years. None of them can hold a candle to the mind-expanding, mythbusting fountain of endless useless knowledge that is QI. Stephen Fry needs to be elected supreme leader of the entire fucking universe in a hurry or we're all fucked. 

You may have seen a little improvisation show hosted by formerly fat lovable dickhead Drew Carey, titled Whose Line Is It Anyway? If you have (or even if you haven't), you should check out the vastly superior British original. Ryan Stiles and Colin Mochrie are there for most of it, along with a plethora of highly talented and incredibly funny British, American and Canadian actors and comedians including self-proclaimed Smartest Man in the World, Greg Proops. If you're into improv, this should keep you busy for a while. :D

About supporting a second team, I think it depends how much are you into the second team. I love my team here in Argentina, I travel to wherever it plays, etc., and I can sympathize with another foreign club, like Manchester City, but it would be weird if I celebrate a goal - mostly I go to check the results on newspapers or watch the most beautiful goals, things like that.

The expensive part of going to games it's something I think makes people less interested. Here in Argentina, all the games are free on TV, they are streaming in the public TV channel - and go to the stadium can be cheap: you can go to the ""tribune"" for 10 dllrs aprox, although is hardly comfortable - you see the match as if you were in a crowd concert.

About Rugby, I was on last February in Edinburgh and it had place a match between Scotland and France in Rugby. It was awesome, everything was really nice and people were celebrating all together.

true,HarryBlessKnapp,null,Petes not so secret gay lover,"I've began on odyssey into the world of beer. I got fed up for lagers and all the mass produced stuff because it normally gets pumped through shit pipes and not looked after properly and begins to taste like piss as soon as it even slightly increases in temperature. I don't mind any of them. I'll drink them all. I prefer Peroni or Stella from tap, or maybe a Heineken. I'm not overly fussed though, these just taste better regardless of the care involved. I'd take any lager regardless of brand if it was served properly.

So yeah, I've been branching out for a year or so now. I too began with Hobgoblin. It's good. Really good. Once I tasted that it opened my eyes and since then I've been trying all sorts. Hobgoblin gets a bit much for me though. I really like the taste. But I can only drink about 2 bottles, and then it gets a bit sickly, and starts to feel really thick, a bit like syrup.

However, if you're a lager fan or coming from lagers like I was, what I've learnt thus far is that for my tastes golden/blonde/light brown/amber ales are where it's at. Anything of that ilk from the badger brewery seems to be right up my street. It seems lighter than Hobgoblin so I feel like I could do a full session on it, if only any pub served it. Pretty cool that you found a pub that serves hobgoblin. The other thing I've learnt with these ales is that they don't have to be served as cold as possible - lagers tend to be cold because it numbs your taste buds which is why they taste like shit when warm. Badger's Golden Champion for example, I pulled out of the fridge ice cold and it wasn't great. But then it warmed up a bit and it was nice. So next bottle I took out of the fridge and let it warm up a little and it was banging. I think it's my favourite beer so far out of all them I've tried. I still don't know what I'm doing though. I think I like sweet, bitter and fruity, and not so hoppy and malty, but light coloured and with a decent bit of carbonation. I can't stand flat, creamy dark stuff like Boddingtons. But what sort of beer is a boddingtons? And what is Guiness? I'm such a city boy. I don't know anything about ale. We're just raised on cheap lager from birth in London.

As it happens I'm just about to crack open my 1st IPA on my next step on my quest.

I was literally just about to start a thread about this actually, which is why I came in here.


TL;DR I'm sick of being served shit lagers in pubs, I don't mind any of them if they're served right, but prefer Stella or Peroni. But I'm branching out to try and avoid this serving problem because ales don't HAVE to be ice cold to be nice. Although I've yet to find a pub that serves golden ale, though hopefully my knowledge gained will help me find better alternatives in pubs that I go to.",0,1356887951,null,0,false,0,c7oaxca,t3_15o8ej,t1_c7oaxca,t3_15o8ej,null,1430808383,3,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,3

1. There is not always a new incarnation of the Doctor every season. This happened with the Eccleston-Tennant switch at the end of Season 1 in the new series, but Tennant and Smith both were/are on the show for more than one season. The Doctor ""reincarnates"" through a process called regeneration that is triggered upon his imminent death. This reforms his physical form and he has a new personality, but he is still the same Doctor.

2. His hand-held device is called a Sonic Screwdriver. It mainly functions as a skeleton key of sorts, that can lock or unlock any door except wooden locks or deadlock seals. Other than this it can be used to hack machines, damage circuits, alter programming, and even melt ice.

3. Since the death of the Time Lords, the laws of time are void. The Doctor still tries to adhere to the laws of time, and will generally not do things such as being in the same place twice (though Eccleston and Rose do this in the first season.)

IF you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:
If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
' Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,
if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!

true,twistedpuppet,troughton,Troughton,"First, the changing of the actor playing the Doctor happens specifically due to the actor having to leave the role for whatever reason. This happened the first time during the First Doctor's run. He got too sick to continue the role, so the show writers came up with a way to continue the show without him and have it still make sense to the story. So, they came up with what is called Regeneration. Any time the lead actor has to leave the show, they find a way to get him mortally wounded(meaning he should be dead from this) and when people of the Doctor's race are mortally wounded, they regenerate into a new body.  Usually it doesn't happen every season. Most actor stay in the role for about 2 to 3 years. Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor stayed on for an impressive 7 years. 

Second, the device is called a Sonic Screwdriver. He uses it to open locked doors, hack computers, rewire things, and sometimes re-connect cut barbed wire. It doesn't work on wood or deadlocks.

Third, for the most part, the Doctor doesn't double back on his own time line. This is probably a self imposed rule. But he also forces it on the companions sometimes because it can cause some nasty side effects.  Sometimes he does double back onto his own timeline because you know, rules were meant to be broken. :P

* What you are referring to is ""Regeneration."" Basically the race that the Doctor is, Timelord, have the ability to regenerate when they are dying. But this causes their face and personality to change. Thus, each actor is a different character basically. We usually refer to them by number of incarnation. In the new series we have had 9 (Christopher Eccleston), 10 (David Tennant), and now 11 (Matt Smith). Now there is some canon that states a timelord can only have 12 regenerations, or 13 incarnations. This has been disputed, and considering the new series loves to ignore established fiction, this will probably be changed when the time comes. 

* The hand held device you are referring to is the ""Sonic Screwdriver.""  In the first 4 seasons it acts like as a skeleton key, a universal remote, and like a ""screwdriver,"" as in it can fix many things. It has limitations. It doesn't work on wood for instance. Since season 5 it has acted as that and more. 11 likes to sonic (Slang for use the Sonic Screwdriver on something) objects, and then look at it like he's reading something. Like a status report if you will. It tells him information that you couldn't tell just by looking at said object. 

* There are rules. Don't mess with your own time line. It's been done once in the new series that I can think of off the top of my head. In Series 1, the Episode Fathers Day. I won't spoil it for you, but it's a good example of things NOT to do. Also the rule about two of him existing together can be broken. Like in the classic serial ""The Three Doctors,"" the first three incarnations of the Doctor team up to fight the Timelord Omega. Now this also technically won't happen again. Also the Doctor is alone. Pre-9 episodes feature other Timelords, but between 7 and 9, a great war called the Time War happened between the Daleks and the Timelords. The Doctor sealed the time war in a time bubble, unable to escape. This (sort of) stopped the Daleks, and the Time War itself, but it leaves The Doctor as the only of his kind left. I won't spoil much more of this, mainly because it is the root of all of seasons 1-4.

For the curious, the poem is 'If' by Rudyard Kipling.  



IF you can keep your head when all about you  
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,  
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,  
But make allowance for their doubting too;  
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,  
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,  
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,  
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise.  




If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;  
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;  
 If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster  
 And treat those two impostors just the same;  
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken  
 Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,  
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,  
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools.  




If you can make one heap of all your winnings  
 And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,  
And lose, and start again at your beginnings  
And never breathe a word about your loss;  
 If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew  
To serve your turn long after they are gone,  
And so hold on when there is nothing in you  
Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'  




If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, '  
Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,  
if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,  
 If all men count with you, but none too much;  
If you can fill the unforgiving minute

If you don't know him, van Rompuy is the closest thing to the president of the EU. That sounds like blackmail to me. Either stay in the club or we'll crush you.

As for federalisation, if you follow any of the precedings in Brussels it's very evident that is the direction things are going. The transfer of powers in the eurozone over the last year is incredible. The greek budget has to be run past Brussels to be passed, and all banks will be supervised from the ECB in 2014. With the EU planning to control national budgets in the near future. [(source)](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304782404577490023691831582.html)

Listen to the European Parliament President [(video)](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19598582), and tell me that federalisation isn't planned?

Finally, I agree with you that financially we may take a hit leaving the EU. The deal we strike will of course be key. But the way I see it, we will only have one chance to vote on whether we are going to be part of a supernational country or stay as the UK, and in the long term I think it would be in our interests to stay out.

true,KnownForNothing,lfc99,,"Well, good win from us. I'll try my best to talk about the players.

Reina - Troubled a little from shots, good save on the free kick my Mbia considering he was unsighted.

Skrtel and Agger - Solid at the back, good header from Agger from the third goal. Good play overall.

Enrique - Unfortunate that he was forced to go off, but was excellent. A few mistakes early on, but besides that he was just running up and down the left side attacking and defending brilliantly.

Johnson - We have two amazing fullbacks, really, especially with Enrique hitting his form. Johnson was great going forward as well, defensively good, and also linked up well.

Gerrard - Good to see him chase after balls and run back into defense again, at times this season he just seemed absent from defense. Should have scored, but played well.

Allen - His natural role is supposedly further forward, but he always seems to play really well when he plays in the DM position. His first few games for us were ther and he looked great, and now that he's there again, he just did what he always does, quietly control the midfield for us.

Henderson - Good game, maybe a little poor decision making at times (nicking the ball off Gerrard when he was going for the shot, ambitious shots/passes) but was really solid and controlled the game for us in the final third. He was always there to receive the ball and pass it on, to keep it moving in general. To be fair, some of his shots were not too far away.

Sterling - Looked a bit nervous and didn't seem himself in the first half, picked it up in the second half and looked more lively, but never threatened too dangerously. He's still kind of predictable, always cuts in for the pass or shot.

Downing - Well, he was pretty hardworking chasing down the ball, but didn't really do much besides that. Just another member of the squad passing the ball around, he was okay in this game, I guess.

Suarez - Where do I start? That first goal was absolutely incredible. It completely put us in charge there (if it wasn't already clear enough) and that second goal basically sealed it for us, QPR looked to have given up by that point, until the second half. MoTM, no contest.

Subs:

Suso - Good to see him, his footwork is great as usual but doesn't link up with the team as nicely as he should be. The Downing-Johnson link up play isn't very good but the Suso-Johnson link up play is worse than that. I still feel like he needs to be moved more centrally, he seems to keep drifting in, leaving Johnson to cover the right.

Lucas - Slotted in for Allen very well, they might have been the same player for all I cared.

Carragher - lol defensive mid carragher",0,1356890894,null,0,false,0,c7obmiw,t3_15ohd6,t1_c7obmiw,t3_15ohd6,null,1430808719,14,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,14

The Great Intelligence is a being before our universe and has been trying to obtain a human form for some time. It has possessed people before and made multiple attempts in earlier generations of Who to take on a physical form of it's own. I think at some point in time it may have experimented further when possessing a human to see if it could create the perfect body for it to posses. Seeing as how possessing is a temporary and fundamentally flawed solution. In the process it created a human that was more than human but still fundamentally human.

Thus Clara is born as a human with a consciousnesses that transcends space and time causing her to be reborn repeatedly. She doesn't retain full memories of each of her lives but keeps the same mental blueprints and instincts. In both her incarnations so far she has been shown to have high intelligence which could have been helped along by her inheritance. It could also link to why her last word repeat. Her being ""freed"" from her life, her consciousness is taking on it's free form and she can momentarily link all her lives together giving her a brief moment of true memory.

This would also set the Intelligence up for a very nasty return in the future when it tries to regain it's little experiment while keeping Clara one the innocent side.

These instances gave LFC second chance attacks, allowed Liverpool to retain the majority of midfield possession, and killed many QPR attacks.

true,NeoNerd,scot-Aberdeen,Aberdeenshire,"Negligence payouts are an easy target. But these payouts aren't excessive. People don't profit from these claims. You must match each claim to a recognizable loss. They really are compensatory, not a way of making money.

It's easy to scoff when seeing huge awards of multiple millions of Pounds. But these almost exclusively go to children who have been injured during birth or in early life. Injured in a way that won't shorten their lifespan, but will drastically affect their lives. You can imagine the huge sums of money required to pay for 24 hour medical care over a period of 65-70 years. 

The article claims that the system is unjust because two babies injured at birth got different payouts - one huge and another nothing. Without knowing the exact details, this is an absurd statement to make. Even if both were injured by medical staff, the bar for claims is set much higher than in other cases. 

Which I suppose is another point. It isn't easy to successfully bring a medical negligence case. That fact that so many cases are being successfully raised is worrying. Perhaps the NHS could try to improve standards instead of cutting payouts?

true,ProtoKun7,smith,Smith,"1. The Doctor is a Time Lord; Time Lords have the capability to regenerate, meaning that after being fatally wounded (or by choice) they can regenerate into a new body, where most of their cells are rearranged, changing their appearance but retaining the core person. This doesn't change every series though; the Fourth Doctor was around for 7 broadcast years (1974-1981).

2. The tool is a sonic screwdriver. There have been a few different models; it does have limitations but over the years it has had improvements made. It still doesn't handle wood so well and sometimes is affected by interference from hairdryers, and it cannot open deadlock  seals which weren't set in place by him.

3. The TARDIS only *looks* like a phone box, you understand. It's not really a phone box like Bill &amp; Ted, but a phone box disguise. Ordinarily it would change shape to blend in wherever it landed, but that circuit got stuck and so it always looks like a police box. The way time works is that you shouldn't interfere with your own timeline, as this creates problems which are damaging to the universe. The Ninth Doctor took his companion slightly into the past once, where they saw themselves; she did something which created a paradox, damaging time, and extratemporal creatures appeared in an attempt to sterilise the wound in time. That's only one example; there are plenty of other ways that can be damaging which are occasionally explained.

Think about it this way: If you did something, went back in time and changed what you did, you would also see yourself making the first decision. If you change the decision then you will stop yourself making the wrong decision, so therefore you would not have needed to go back in time. That is a paradox, and a big problem to be avoided when you're a time traveller.",0,1356894768,null,0,false,0,c7ocmwr,t3_15ogwg,t1_c7ocmwr,t3_15ogwg,null,1430809193,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,Spellamentalist,null,null,"I really don't feel like it's fair to say that that these things should have been expected.  Arthurian legend is Arthurian legend, but they've made it clear many times now that this was a clear reimagination, as any decent fictional endeavor with a measure of artistic license and personal direction.

I was looking forward to it as well, and the ending made me sad as shit, but the fact that it was depressing didn't make it a bad ending for me.  I wasn't prepared for it, and I think the impact was much bigger because of that.  I'm not a huge fan of the concept that endings needs to be sad or bittersweet.  I think happy endings are seriously way-too-often ignored and considered to be bad storytelling, which I think is complete and utter bullshit.

But I don't think that people *need* to be redeemed.  I don't think Morgana needs to have a sudden moment of clarity.  She has been selfish, unruly, and fallen to evil for so long that I can't imagine her death suddenly undoing all of her experiences that have influenced her motivations thus far.

Merlin has been Arthur's adviser for awhile now.  It wasn't some fanfare of a transition, but a gradual one.  It was part of their developed relationship.  Arthur's fondness for Merlin and his respect for Merlin's character and wisdom has been displayed in a very nice way along the series.  At first he doesn't like to hear much from his servant.  He eventually learns to deal with it while telling him to shut up.  Then he realizes that Merlin's advice isn't so bad, and comments that Merlin seems too wise for his own good.  And eventually, he is having serious conversations with him about very personal issues.  I know it wasn't spread out and made abundantly clear that Merlin was his personal confidant, but I feel like that relationship was reimagined into the dynamic of their friendship.

It's hard not getting to see the things you hope for.  One of the most depressing things when I think about it is that with Arthur being 'The Once and Future King', that he will return in some fashion (whether literally or through some other means such as reincarnationâI'm not particularly familiar with Arthurian legend) I think about how Gwen will be dead and gone and that it's just kind of over.

The relationships were made so paramount in this story.  I don't think they pulled a LOST, either by catering to the Merlin/Arthur dynamic in the finale, because I feel like it's always been about that dynamic rather than focusing on questions and answers.  Alexander Vlahos (Mordred) said in an interview that the finale kind of becomes this platonic love story between Arthur and Merlin, and I completely agree with that.

It was so much more moving to watch Arthur go through the motions of realizing what Merlin, a sorcerer, and his close friend, had actually done for him throughout the years, and come to accept him, magic and all.  Clearly we can't know if he was suddenly converted to the idea that magic is okay, but he let his prejudice go for his friend, and I think that gave a glaring ton of closure to their story.

I never really expected to see the Golden Age.  I did expect to see Arthur live, and I'm still sad about it, but the way the characters ultimately say goodbye to one another throughout the finale really made it memorable and emotional.",0,1356895208,null,0,false,0,c7ocr7c,t3_15odtm,t1_c7ocr7c,t3_15odtm,null,1430809255,21,false,merlinbbc,t5_2s3xe,21

**I Wandered as Lonely as a Cloud**

I WANDERED lonely as a cloud

That floats on high o'er vales and hills,

When all at once I saw a crowd,

A host, of golden daffodils;

Beside the lake, beneath the trees,

Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.


            


Continuous as the stars that shine

And twinkle on the milky way,

They stretched in never-ending line

Along the margin of a bay: 

Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
          
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.





The waves beside them danced; but they
         
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
         
A poet could not but be gay,

In such a jocund company:

I gazed--and gazed--but little thought





What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
         
In vacant or in pensive mood, 
        
They flash upon that inward eye
        
Which is the bliss of solitude;
         
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
         
And dances with the daffodils.





William Wordsworth

true,CptKittenNose,null,null,"- The biggest problem that the ""empty"" regions caused was during the set-up time for casting the negative of the carved face. Because Sculpey is a non-hardening clay, when the plaster was curing, the heat from it warmed the Sculpey and created a pretty powerful suction, which made it difficult to remove the positive. That was really the only problem that I had with it, though, so in the long run it was a good choice to use. I was doing this special project along with another student who had taken the class before (though she was doing old age instead of sci fi), and she used your basic air-dry clay to make her carved positive. The final result was very disappointing to her, as hardly any of her carving showed up in the final casting.

- The mask is still just fine, though I haven't had the chance to wear it again after my final day. I could easily use it (I would guess) up to a dozen times or so, if I took care of it. I could forsee that the paint would begin to flake off at that point, but you can always put more on.

- [I had a chance to cast a version of this with expanding foam latex](http://i.imgur.com/CAVfG.jpg), which I would have done as my final version had it not been such a sloppy casting on my part. Expanding foam is significantly lighter, can hold make-up much better than latex, and looks quite a bit more natural when done correctly. While the basic latex was great, cheap, and easy to use, I would really like to experiment with other materials for my next one. Also, I'd make the mask itself go further up and around my head, and make the flanges out of expanding foam as well. There was only so much I could do with the little time that I had. :&lt;

By bus, or train - no matter how -

And lift forever the sad curse

once laid in dull, sarcastic verse

by one whose poetry is worse

than Mills and Boon!

.

Sir John - oh, what a sense of farce!

A poet of the teacup class

obsessed with railways, and stained glass

and twisted bough

.

and thus impervious to the call

of the post-war suburban sprawl

of Harlow, Basildon and all

and glorious Slough!

.

Oh Slough! Harbinger of my dreams!

home of a thousand training schemes

and theme pubs, patronised by streams

Of tetchy men

.

with blow-dried hair and blow-dried brain

diplomas in inflicting pain

and ne'er a thought for Larkin, Raine

and Betjeman!

.

A thousand jewellers' shops contend

The kitchen unit is your friend

Designer labels set the trend

with a blank stare

.

And now - the latest, brightest star -

a brand new ten screen cinema!

The folk will come from near and far

to worship there!

.

Oh self-made, independent town!

The jewel in Margaret's southern crown!

No more will poets put you down

with mocking voice!

Come tourists all, and flock to Slough

as Milton Friedman takes a bow

This town is fit for heroes now -

Come, and rejoice!

true,JimmyNic,null,null,"&gt; I wasn't aware there were plans afoot to have the EU made into a single country. That's actually quite worrying. Have you got any more info on this?

Many of the the [Founding Fathers of the EU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_fathers_of_the_European_Union) saw European Federalisation as a means of preventing the outbreak of future war in the continent. As put forward by [Jean Monnet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Monnet#European_Coal_and_Steel_Community):

&gt; ""Through the consolidation of basic production and the institution of a new High Authority, whose decisions will bind France, Germany and the other countries that join, this proposal represents the first concrete step towards a European federation, imperative for the preservation of peace.""

Of course that was some time ago, and the EU is something of a Hydra these days, all with competing visions. That said there is no doubt that the movement to a single currency was intended as a stepping stone towards political union, as in part is the current banking union. The Europhiles in the political classes never refer to the federal aspirations of the EU because the idea is so unpopular in this country - instead they cite access to the free market. The market is important of course, but is it so important that we should sacrifice our sovereignty for it? As it stands the EU is a confederation, that is a loose federation, but again such a fact is rarely noted. 

I'm not necessarily opposed to a European Federation, but I think the EU has been handled utterly undemocratically by politicians (of the UK and elsewhere), and as such I'm in favour of leaving.

As far as I can tell, from their wikipedia page, they weren't a band in the conventional sense in which we think of such. They weren't a bunch of mates with guitars and bass and drums, who practiced together and got some small gigs before signing to a record company. They appear to have been entirely a creation of their manager, who probably toured stage schools and talent contests to find the necessary one black band member, one posh one, one sporty one, &amp;c. They probably had the choice of accepting the contract he offered, or take a job in Tesco. 

So had they not split up in 2002, and instead continued to greater things, *then* maybe they could have negotiated a better contract and rates. AIUI it's when a conventional band signs their second recording contract they start to make real money.

- stooging around deep space scavenging from derelicts.

- getting into trouble with the silly physics bending toys they find in them

- the characters winding each other up all the way.

It's actually pretty amazing that even after ten seasons they can still do good comedy &amp; character development.

Bagpipe Music

It's no go the merrygoround, it's no go the rickshaw,

All we want is a limousine and a ticket for the peepshow.

Their knickers are made of crepe-de-chine, their shoes are made of python,

Their halls are lined with tiger rugs and their walls with head of bison.


John MacDonald found a corpse, put it under the sofa,

Waited till it came to life and hit it with a poker,

Sold its eyes for souvenirs, sold its blood for whiskey,

Kept its bones for dumbbells to use when he was fifty.


It's no go the Yogi-man, it's no go Blavatsky,

All we want is a bank balance and a bit of skirt in a taxi.


Annie MacDougall went to milk, caught her foot in the heather,

Woke to hear a dance record playing of Old Vienna.

It's no go your maidenheads, it's no go your culture,

All we want is a Dunlop tire and the devil mend the puncture.


The Laird o' Phelps spent Hogmanay declaring he was sober,

Counted his feet to prove the fact and found he had one foot over.

Mrs. Carmichael had her fifth, looked at the job with repulsion,

Said to the midwife ""Take it away; I'm through with overproduction.""


It's no go the gossip column, it's no go the Ceilidh,

All we want is a mother's help and a sugar-stick for the baby.


Willie Murray cut his thumb, couldn't count the damage,

Took the hide of an Ayrshire cow and used it for a bandage.

His brother caught three hundred cran when the seas were lavish,

Threw the bleeders back in the sea and went upon the parish.


It's no go the Herring Board, it's no go the Bible,

All we want is a packet of fags when our hands are idle.


It's no go the picture palace, it's no go the stadium,

It's no go the country cot with a pot of pink geraniums,

It's no go the Government grants, it's no go the elections,

Sit on your arse for fifty years and hang your hat on a pension.


It's no go my honey love, it's no go my poppet;

Work your hands from day to day, the winds will blow the profit.

The glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall forever,

But if you break the bloody glass you won't hold up the weather.

They think a female Doctor would immediately try to play the character as Snooki or one of the girls from ""Sex &amp; The City"" or something equally representative of the absolute worst examples of femininity one can imagine.  Not only is that not true, but it's absolutely insulting &amp; grossly sexist.

On the contrary, the Doctorverse has a long history of examples of strong, yet still feminine, women.  Susan, Ace, Sarah Jane, Rose, Martha, River, Donna, Amy, Kate Stewart (however briefly she appeared in ""The Power Of Three""), Adelaide and now Clara.  Hell, as smart as Clara is, she's damn near a female Doctor already.  So, with a precedent set for quality female characters, it's actually not that far off to imagine them making their most important character of all a woman for at least one incarnation.

Whoever the GirlDoc is, just don't give her to Moffat, because...well, fuck, if River's any indicator, that guy does more to ruin women than a nation of absentee fathers &amp; lucrative porn contracts combined.",0,1356902619,null,0,false,0,c7oer28,t3_15os1x,t1_c7oer28,t3_15os1x,null,1430810185,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

Alfred Tennyson
Written at Edinburgh

O love, what hours were thine and mine,
In lands of palm and southern pine;
In lands of palm, of orange-blossom,
Of olive, aloe, and maize and vine.

What Roman strength Turbia show'd
In ruin, by the mountain road;
How like a gem, beneath, the city
Of little Monaco, basking, glow'd.

How richly down the rocky dell
The torrent vineyard streaming fell
To meet the sun and sunny waters,
That only heaved with a summer swell.

What slender campanili grew
By bays, the peacock's neck in hue;
Where, here and there, on sandy beaches
A milky-bell'd amaryllis blew.

How young Columbus seem'd to rove,
Yet present in his natal grove,
Now watching high on mountain cornice,
And steering, now, from a purple cove,

Now pacing mute by ocean's rim;
Till, in a narrow street and dim,
I stay'd the wheels at Cogoletto,
And drank, and loyally drank to him.

Nor knew we well what pleased us most,
Not the clipt palm of which they boast;
But distant colour, happy hamlet,
A moulder'd citadel on the coast,

Or tower, or high hill-convent, seen
A light amid its olives green;
Or olive-hoary cape in ocean;
Or rosy blossom in hot ravine,

Where oleanders flush'd the bed
Of silent torrents, gravel-spread;
And, crossing, oft we saw the glisten
Of ice, far up on a mountain head.

We loved that hall, tho' white and cold,
Those niched shapes of noble mould,
A princely people's awful princes,
The grave, severe Genovese of old.

At Florence too what golden hours,
In those long galleries, were ours;
What drives about the fresh CascinÃ©
Or walks in Boboli's ducal bowers.

In bright vignettes, and each complete,
Of tower or duomo, sunny-sweet,
Or palace, how the city glitter',
Thro' cypress avenues, at our feet.

But when we crost the Lombard plain
Remember what a plague of rain;
Of rain at Reggio, rain at Parma;
At Lodi, rain, Piacenza, rain.

And stern and sad (so rare the smiles
Of sunlight) look' the Lombard piles;
Porch-pillars on the lion resting,
And sombre, old, colonnaded aisles.

O Milan, O the chanting quires,
The giant windows' blazon' fires,
The height, the space, the gloom, the glory!
A mount of marble, a hundred spires!

I climb' the roofs at break of day;
Sun-smitten Alps before me lay.
I stood among the silent statues,
And statued pinnacles, mute as they.

How faintly-flush', how phantom-fair,
Was Monte Rosa, hanging there
A thousand shadowy-pencill' valleys
And snowy dells in a golden air.

Remember how we came at last
To Como; shower and storm and blast
Had blown the lake beyond his limit,
And all was flooded; and how we past

From Como, when the light was gray,
And in my head, for half the day,
The rich Virgilian rustic measure
Of Lari Maxume, all the way,

Like ballad-burthen music, kept,
As on The Lariano crept
To that fair port below the castle
Of Queen Theodolind, where we slept;

Or hardly slept, but watch' awake
A cypress in the moonlight shake,
The moonlight touching oâer a terrace
One tall AgavÃ© above the lake.

What more? we took our last adieu,
And up the snowy Splugen drew,
But ere we reach'd the highest summit
I pluck'd a daisy, I gave it you.

It told of England then to me,
And now it tells of Italy.
O love, we two shall go no longer
To lands of summer across the sea;

So dear a life your arms enfold
Whose crying is a cry for gold:
Yet here to-night in this dark city,
When ill and weary, alone and cold,

I found, tho crush'd to hard and dry,
This nurseling of another sky
Still in the little book you lent me,
And where you tenderly laid it by:

And I forgot the clouded Forth,
The gloom that saddens Heaven and Earth,
The bitter east, the misty summer
And gray metropolis of the North.

Perchance, to lull the throbs of pain,
Perchance, to charm a vacant brain,
Perchance, to dream you still beside me,
My fancy fled to the South again.",0,1356903641,null,0,false,0,c7of15r,t3_15ogue,t1_c7of15r,t3_15ogue,null,1430810318,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Here we go...

The seventh Doctor is my favorite. I told myself when I started watching classic many months ago that I wouldn't pick a favorite. I wanted to love all the Doctors. And I do. But the seventh has stolen my heart.

He's got a dry humor with a dark Time Lord power underneath, and of course, a kickass companion: Ace. Their relationship is so unique, it's a tag-team ""you do the talking, I do the walking"" with 7 as a sort of stand-in parent/guide and tutor. Yet at the same time, it's almost, if you want to put on the goggles, romantic. But because of the tutor/guide thing and 7's distant otherness, it's very platonic.

And by dark Time Lord power I mean that during the seventh Doctor's era you got the feeling that while the seventh seems like a goofy dusty professor on the outside, sometimes you can tell there's an undercurrent of something. This something is alien, it's terrifying, and it's dangerous.

But it's different from the godlike awe I get from the tenth Doctor. This is where it gets hard to explain. The tenth Doctor's godlike-ness, in my opinion, relates to his vanity. Both are very unique to the tenth Doctor (unlike the shallow narcissism of the sixth or fourth).

But the tenth Doctor makes you think that he is some kind of tragic and lonely god high above us who lives in another plane. The seventh Doctor feels more like a pervasive sense of otherness. Dark otherness. (That and it's been pointed out to me that while Tennant is a fantastic actor, he can't do ""eccentric"" to save his life despite being a master at barely-concealed-anger. McCoy has the opposite acting strength/weakness.)

Btw, this dark sense of otherness is very strong in the novel Lungbarrow. Funnily enough, he is revealed to be the Other in the novel and his cousins in the House of Prydon often wonder what the Doctor is. He's Time's Champion for one thing... What's interesting is that I say these things about the seventh Doctor but I don't know how I reached this feeling. Probably because of the story Remembrance of the Daleks. It was my first seventh Doctor story. I think. I don't know why, but there's something compelling about his personality. It's a blend of dignity and humility, comedy and darkness.

In retrospect he's also an amazing Doctor (and I'm more sure he's my favorite now) because of his excellent run on Big Finish Productions' audio drama range. McCoy's stories have made me cry. Yup. And break my heart. And just recently I listened to what is, imo, the best radio drama* I've heard yet out of 200+ and it's with SEVEN.

*Despite the term ""radio drama"" it's primarily just for purchased on www.bigfinish.com (though it has been on radio). They use the original actors for Doctors and companions, have full cast with full sound. It's not people sitting and narrating. It's like tv but for your ears.

Growing up in a small North-Eastern town, expensive, imported Stella Artois was considered the height of urban sophistication.

Nowadays, Stella is considered uncouth while Newcastle Brown Ale is lauded in some quarters as some kind of artisan craft beer. 

What I am getting at in my rambling slightly pissed state is that all alcoholic drinks are basically revolting and an acquired taste. This is why sweet cider and, latterly, 'Alcopops' are the drink of choice for your novice drinker. Which revolting alcoholic drinks we choose to acquire the taste of is largely determined by fashion and demographics.

edit: Decided to clarify.

Basically, it's in the name ""Time and *Relative Dimension* in Space""

It's not per se 3th and 4th dimension, but as long as the inside has more dimensions than its container, it will effectively be bigger. The physics allow for that to be possible, at any rate. 

I think you're thinking of dimensions as a sort of portal into a whole different world, unless I'm misunderstanding you. This idea could also work, but the terminology wouldn't really be correct. It would use wormholes, the entrance would basically be one. Unfortunately, this idea is actually *more* complex to implement than the previous one. And it as a few disadvantages as well. You can't manipulate the space you have directly, you would need a place that it's linked to (limited storage issues), if someone finds the place manually, they have access to your everything, etc

Good. As long as it is centralising power where it is best capable of exercising it. If it takes away power from my council to collect bins, I will be perturbed. If it takes away power from a state which is seeking help while misappropriating funds, then it should go for it. I see not the problem here in the EZ being involved. I see the problem in a country being part of a unit which is incapable of controlling the currency it designed due to a lack of monetary union.

I don't think the writers should be limited, but I do think they should be wary. 

River Song would of course be tricky to deal with. Not in terms of sexuality, but knowledge. Would she know the Doctor had a female incarnation? And if so, how come she never even teased about it? It's only a tiny spoiler, after all, considering that it wouldn't affect how the Doctor would regenerate anyway. 

I fear a lot of people would stop watching, though, if a female Doctor appeared. Not really for sexist reasons, like a lot of people would assume, on the other hand. For a lot of people, the Doctor is male, period. To them, changing that, is  basically doing a reboot Ã  la Hollywood.

I think Greece is a little more complicated than the EU *imposing* its will upon the Greek state. It is sad to see Greece going through such hard times and to see the EU advocating those conditions. However, this isn't the EU manipulating Greece because it can. Greece lied about it's accounts and numbers to get into the EU and eventually the Eurozone and would like to be given a big bailout and then drop its obligations to that bailout ^(gigantic over simplification I know). 

Basically what I'm trying to say is there's a lot more to it than just the EU imposing itself on others. Greece is kind of to blame in that situation (not the greek people obviously). Yes Greece could run away having reaped many benefits, but to do so would be ridiculously unfair. So it has to deal with the EU's demands.

Jamille Matt - Kidderminster Harriers (Sky Sports)

Not sure about this guy, he isn't proven in the championship, but then again, look what happened with Beckford.

Ian Harte - Reading (The Sun)

Not sure about this one, I think I'd prefer a younger player at left-back, we've been struggling there all season so it needs to be the right man for the job (not sure who)

Craig Mackail-Smith - Brighton (The Sun &amp; Daily Mail)

Personally don't like him but he's a proven goalscorer which is what we need.

Rickie Lambert - Southampton (Daily Mail)

As much as I'd really like Lambert at Leeds, I can't see it happening, he's doing well for the Saints and I couldn't see him wanting to step down a division.

Alan Tate - Swansea (The Sun)

If Tate finds the form from his first few games for Leeds then he'd be a great signing.

Michael Tonge - Stoke City (various)

This one should hopefully go through within the first week of the transfer window, he's been very good for us this season and we're already starting to miss him.

Lewis McGugan - Nottingham Forest (The Sun)

Would love to see McGugan at Leeds, he's on the bench for Forest quite a bit and I'm hoping he'll come.

Dexter Blackstock - Nottingham Forest (Daily Mirror)

Another good player, sky sports commentator said that he was the best at heading the ball in the championship, although we already have that player...

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'd repost this to /r/unitedkingdom, /r/AskUK or even /r/personalfinance, since this subreddit seems to be more focused on cutting expenses rather than what to do with leftover money.

Honestly, I'm as clueless as you are but I'll tell you what little I know.

I'm assuming you have a budget and you are somehow keeping track of your expenses (if you don't, you should). What savings account you should choose depends on how big your difference between income and expenditure is and what your bank offers. I'll use my bank (Barclays) as an example, so your mileage may vary. If you want you could tell me which bank you're using so I can see the specifics of what they offer.

First you have your normal, run of the mill Instant Access savings accounts. You can put money in and take money out any time you like. These usually give you very little interest and tax is deducted from what little interest you get, but the money is at your disposal whenever you need it so it might be good as an emergency fund.

Then you have ISAs (Cash ISA to be specific, there's another ISA called an Stocks and Shares ISA but it doesn't matter right now.) These are almost exactly like Instant Access savings account in the sense that you can put money in and take money out whenever you want, with the added benefit that the interest rate is higher and you don't have to pay tax on it. But there's one key difference: you can only put in up to Â£5,640 in each tax year (April 6th to April 5th the following year). Note that I said you can only put in Â£5,640, not that your balance can't be above Â£5,640. For example, if you put in 2000 quid in your Cash ISA and then take it all out, you can then only put in Â£3,640, despite the fact that the account in empty.

Next you have Regular savings accounts, which as you said, you have to put in a specific amount every certain interval (in Barclays case monthly) by standing order. Although unlike you said, Regular savings accounts do let you make withdrawals but they try to encourage you not to, usually by reducing the interest rate for months where you do make withdrawals. These usually give you a pretty high interest rate but they force you to put money in every month, so they aren't recommended if your income/expenditure margin is quite thin, in case you have an emergency expense that month.

Finally you have bonds. In these, like in government bonds, you give the bank a lump of money and you can't touch it until it matures (i.e. ""time is up""). They usually give you a pretty good interest rate but of course it means that you essential won't have that money for however long you agreed to (usually a year, longer bonds give you better interest rates). I know Barclays has a special ""flexible"" bond where you can only make three withdrawals of up to 10% of the initial deposit, but that changes from bank to bank.

Hope this was helpful, don't hesitate to ask if I missed something or anything I wrote wasn't clear.",0,1356916239,null,0,false,0,c7oii6v,t3_15mhrr,t1_c7oii6v,t3_15mhrr,null,1430812037,1,false,UKFrugal,t5_2u4mi,1

Smith gets the (deserved) hate because he doesn't work well as a character.  He thinks that silly is impressive and he's obsessed with being cool.  These things (individually or in combination) do not make for an appealing character to watch.  His somber moments are his best, but they really are too few and far between.

Also not helping him is the fact that Moffat's writing isn't as strong as Davies'.

I do completely agree with you that *some* people simply don't like anything foreign, be it people with a Slavic accent or people with a Caribbean complexion.

That said, I also do seriously believe that a lot of people view the effect of mass immigration poorly. Not to say we wouldn't have gun crime if we didn't have lots of immigrants in the 60's, but given that gun crime is centred around the children of people we accepted in the 60's, I think that many people feel that if we hadn't had the immigration, we wouldn't have some of the problems we're having today.

Now granted they're ignoring all of the benefits because they're less in ones face and they're less immediately obvious, but I don't think we can just write off all anti-immigration stances as inherently racist if we want to achieve anything. We have to accept that immigration has had some very good sides, and some very negative sides also, and that some people feel that the negatives outweigh the positives. To write these people off as racist just seems like the easy way out to me, like a way of ending a debate without having to take part in it, and that's not something I support.

I support immigration to the extent which we can integrate people, which overall makes me a supporter of the concept, at least, of immigration to this country - but there are a lot of people out there who feel differently and to write off *all* of their beliefs as simply racist isn't helpful, it won't advance anything, it just creates a divide which I think is honestly most artificial.

Do feel free to go ahead and make implications that I'm a racist though ;) j/k",0,1356920276,null,0,false,0,c7ojl2y,t3_xahqx,t1_c7ojl2y,t1_c7oj5dd,null,1430812533,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Hello,
With the coming year, Frank Lampard is said to not have a contract for the upcoming season. This is horse shit. Letting Lampard go would be the worst move for our club. He is a leader. He holds the team together. He connects all players on and off the field. He is John Terry's right hand man. How could the club let him go? Even if we don't play him, we need to keep him. He played an extremely crucial part in the rise of Chelsea under our owner, Roman Abromovich. I am confident in saying that, without Lampard, we would not be where we are now. We would not have as many trophies and we would not be the world power that Chelsea has become. 

All fans are asking to keep Frank Lampard. For the club's sake and for the fans, please offer him another contract and let him finish his career with the best club on earth.

Thank You",0,1356920491,null,0,false,0,c7ojnb8,t3_15opx0,t1_c7ojnb8,t3_15opx0,null,1430812565,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

It's just a matter of PR work or updating their sound to fit today's manufactured sound. Sure, their songs sounds outdated like any other 90's pop song, just like kids today would think 80's music sounds outdated and shit, it doesn't mean it's an invalid piece of music. It was popular at the time for a reason.

But yeah, with just three members left and no new music, they are essentially just a tribute band (and their voices haven't aged well, probably from years of not singing). Which is a little sad, but who's to say they're not having fun? If they'd managed to get all 7 members back with some money behind them, get in shape and update their sound, they could have probably made some money.

As for why the TARDIS doesn't leave behind all the dirt (as it does with rain and snow as seen in new series) I think it's because the dirt helps it blend in . A super shiny police box can call attention to itself, where a dirty one looks like its been there for a while.... Helps the perception (somebody elses problem field) filter do its work.

After all they have expressed an interest in killing off all of human kind an they have to realize the Doctor is going to be an obstacle to that. I don't know how they plan to use Clara but I am fairly confidant that there skill set and Clara's impossibility are too nice a fit for it to be a coincidence.

I think it would be evil and awesome if they somehow turned Clara into a paradox that the Doctor would have to sacrifice her to fix or else loose all humanity. This would set us up for either ""angry sad doctor"" or ""I am cleverer then you doctor"" both of which I love.

It just seems to me that, if any footballers are religious, most of them tend to keep it a private matter, at least when they're on the pitch...  excluding of course the traditional praying before you enter the pitch thing, as well as the ""two fingers up to a relative in heaven or god or whatever"" thing, neither of which really tell us much about the player's beliefs.

First off, if we're following Torchwood canon as well, we already know Jack's children don't inherit his immortality. It's [Clara's not dying] not even the same kind of immortality. Clara doesn't wake up 10 minutes later like Jack. She dies and is, let's say, reincarnated. But more on that in a minute. As for River, I'm sure she would have at least mentioned something in ""Forest of the Dead"", you know, when she *chose* to die. Also, Clara does not reincarnate [regenerate?] like any time-lord [Time Lord?] we've ever seen.

&gt; I've also heard some theories that she's the Tardis [TARDIS?]... somehow. I don't see the logic in this at all. We've seen the Tardis [TARDIS?] take a corporeal form and the *mechanics* of it all don't mach [sic] what's going on with Clara.

&gt; My theory is that Clara is a girl who's been scattered all through the time. [sic] Her physical form, her consciousness, and at least some part of her memories. We've seen it before in Classical [Classic?] Who,  in the City of Death episode arch [sic], an alien that was fragmented through time when his spaceship exploded.

Clara is the embodiment of an semi-autonomous parallel universe that is spontaneously created throughout time as a reflection of ""actual reality"". The reason and nature of her occurrence is likely as a manifestation of human nature itself (which may explain her ingenuity and intuition -- she can simulate a seemingly innumerable number of outcomes yet cannot escape from situations from which she has no control -- this explains the how/why she was able to hack Dalek technology), or more likely a third party yet-to-be-named villain (The Great Intelligence?) whom is using her as a means to obtain information about the doctor's weakness(es). The reason she/it manifests itself as a human is then either because the yet-to-be-named villain knows that the doctor is weak to attractive, clever women or she is simply the embodiment of the characteristics for which she is a reflection of (human inquisitivity).

As to why she is able to recall events of her incarnations at or near her time of death suggests there is some other-worldly permanence to her existence (or history of events), even though she herself isn't aware of them until the parallel universe herself collapses. If this is being used as a record of knowledge obtained about the doctor by a third party, collapse is akin to a 'sync' back to some universal store of knowledge.

*Liverpool is a fundamental part of my life. They don't remember me that way, but time will change that. I could not have chosen a better place to go when I left AtlÃ©tico (Madrid).*

*I decided to leave because I had to take a step forwards. It wasn't the best way to have gone but nor were things exactly as they were sold [to people].*

*The other day when the news broke about Hillsborough, I felt emotional, I have experienced that, I know what the people have been through, I have seen them cry. I've lived that, I made it mine.*

*This has arrived too late but it's another step [in the right direction]. And it is things like that that playing for Liverpool gives you: it's a feeling.*

*Also my son was born in liverpool and is a liverpool fan'*

Again betting odds really aren't influenced by rumors, not directly at least. They change their odds when there's a spike in bets for certain things, most likely because of the latest BS rumors the papers churn out, thus indirectly affecting the betting odds. Their main job is to make money, not secretly slip transfer rumors to the public, so of course they're going to prey on people who take stock in the latest rumors, by altering their odds to reflect that. Most of the time it really doesn't have anything to do with accurate rumors, just whether or not people are gullible enough to believe the latest made up transfer rumor.

true,musicnerdfighter,tardis,TARDIS,"It's funny, I've always groaned when the Daleks show up. I think because over and over again in the first seasons of the new series, the Doctor thinks he's obliterated all of them, yet they keep showing back up. I stated referring to them as ""them pesky Daleks"" around season 2 or so.

Yes, there is a big difference as the seasons go on. Part of this is, I think, due to contract issues, actors moving on, possibly writers as well when RTD left (not sure, haven't researched it much). I know they've tried to get Captain Jack back but have had trouble with his scheduling, especially with Torchwood shooting. I'm really hoping he'll be back for the 50th anniversary.

All that to say, Doctor Who wouldn't be around for 50 years if it didn't evolve. Watching the Classic Who gives the same impression of a very different show. Some of these changes are intentional from the writers, some are probably due to budget cuts or expansions, some to actor availability...the reason the Doctor regenerates is because they wanted to re-cast, and to continue to be able to do so. To me, that's what Doctor Who is, a continuing evolution. To some extent, it really is like we're following one man's (alien's) life, albeit an extraordinary one.

true,TaylorHammond9,null,null,"Yes, I've spent more time than you know researching other religions.

So, it seems as though you wanted a story, so here it is. I grew up in a very supportive Christian Family. They were very relaxed, not over the top religious, but definitely supported Christian values and such. Once I hit highschool, I realized that I didn't really believe in a God, but I always just listened to my parents, and went to church. I decided to do some research myself. I spent a few weeks during Summer break one year, and obviously, since my parents were Christians, I wanted to start with atheism. I wanted to see the opposite side of it all. I came to the realization, of how much God loves me through studying I think I did about 3/4 of the Bible. I doubt you want to here me go on quoting scripture and such... 

I'd love to hear YOUR ""proof""... Is it the ***theory*** of evolution? I'm not saying you have to believe what I do, but your belief is a theory, if you really want to do some research of the bible, I think it'd be great for you.

I have no problem with you believing something else other then what I do, it is your choice. As much as I wish you would spend sometime of your own doing research rather then what you see on Reddit (unless you have). 

As you said in your second paragraph-

&gt;which ones do you think exist

Who ever has a personal relationship with God, and believes Jesus is the son of him. That is it. Nothing else to it.

You also talk about if I have ever spent time researching other religions that I believe. Because honestly, it doesn't matter. I have a personal relationship with God. I don't need to say I'm a Christian to have this relationship. I don't need to go to Church to have this relationship. Yes, I was given a choice, and I did the research and this is what I came out with.

true,GetKenny,eng-sussex,South Saxon,"Ok here's my take on it:

Well, for a start the accounts for the EU budget hadn't been signed off by the EU accountants for 15 years.  That means that they thought there were serious 'anomalies'  in the accounts submitted for all of this time.

The personal behaviour of MEP's and the way they conduct their expenses claims has been likened to 'pigs at a trough' - routinely claiming 1st class travel, actually travelling normal class, and pocketing the difference.  Employing family members and giving them unrealistic salaries, and other shenanigans with accommodation - British MP style.

For me, more serious were the circumstances surrounding the entry of Greece and Italy (maybe Ireland as well) into the eurozone.  It is clear that the books were well and truly cooked, certainly in the case of Greece to make it look like it was ready to join, and in collusion with the Germans and possibly the French.  This resulted in Greece borrowing and spending a ridiculous amount of money compared to the level of debt it could possibly service. It's hard to fathom how anyone with any information about the Greek economy and a calculator could possibly think it was a good idea to lend Greece, (and Italy and Ireland for that matter) all those billions.  Who profited from all this? I'm sure a few did.  For example, I wonder how many luxury German cars were exported to Greece during this bonanza?  Ordinary Greek people have been betrayed.  They are the ones picking up the bill, and they are rightly very angry.

I'm not an expert on state economic affairs, but to me this is just bewildering and totally contrary to common sense.

Specifically, it's been sorta done last year with both Amy and her baby being duplicated using The Flesh. Since the GI has been around since, well, forever, wouldn't it know how to do the same thing? Or is it that the Great Intelligence is actually an Adequate Intelligence? ;)

Then again, Oswin Oswald could be a 'Bad Wolf' or 'Crack in the Universe' thing: an 'echo' that keeps appearing wherever the doctor goes. This leads me to a barely substantiated theory: OO is a creation of Doctor Who. So far, she's been the Entirely Too Perfect companion. She erases all information of the Doctor across, seemingly, the Universe. She appears to be as smart as the Doctor and finds the Doctor so sexy that she kisses him hard and, thanks to her bustle, throws herself on top of him. And she doesn't 'die' removing one of the fears the Doctor has: that he ends up unacceptably hurting his companions.

As a story line, it has the wonderful possibility of the Doctor having a breakdown when he realises that she is his creation: To 'heal' himself, he has to invoke all his previous incarnations.

Again, don't think this is anything like the story being told. It is just fun speculation.

This is therefore the fear of the anti-developers - that huge swathes of countryside will become urban estates.

What would be a more interesting compromise is to permit the construction of low-rise flats, say no more than 5 stories high, but then mandate that they have to have an equivalent amount of land left untouched as if they were all built as conventional housing.

So rather than taking over an entire field, you build on a corner of it, and leave the rest as protected arable, or natural reserve.

5-story blocks can easily be shielded from visual objections by trees and strategic locations in hollows or behind hills.

That also allows for lower cost flats instead of expensive executive homes, which is better for the local community.

All we need is for small towns/villages to drop their objection not so much to the provision of housing, but to blocks of flats as the housing option.

He's operating on a very similar track to Lucas, coming from his childhood club, a former captain at the youth levels (I believe he is still the u-21 captain), joining the club he was shifted to a different position from his natural one. However Lucas had two massive advantages, first his price wasn't necessarily high - about 5m; and secondly and more importantly he always had the managers' trust. Rafa had a plan for Lucas and sure enough the patience paid off.
Now Jordan came for a high price, but being English he was never going to get the same time as Lucas, and with Rodgers he's had to prove himself all over again.

-The Second Doctor did not take his regeneration lightly. Granted the circumstances were different and he was being forced into it, but either way there is definitely a precedent of the Doctor not going quietly into the night.

-Regardless of my own opinions on the changes RTD made to the Doctor Who mythos, given those changes that he did make, 10 was DIFFERENT. He loved Rose more than any companion at that point, he was closer and more physical with all his companions, he started flirting with just how much power he had, etc. Remember, it was 10 who claimed himself Timelord Victorious. 10 was when the Doctor saw himself as the most infallible and bullet proof. Even if you don't like those things about the show (I certainly didn't like all of them), it makes sense in that context that the Doctor would really hate such a stark reminder of his own version or mortality.

Having built up tension for three whole episodes, he resolves it by having the public chanting 'doctor' repeatedly, only to have the doctor begin flying, sprouting some science jargon at the master, who has at this point become some whimpering disney-like villain, and then the doctor proceeds to use some kind of unexplained telekinesis to disarm the master.  The whole thing is ridiculously over the top, and, to be honest, somewhat cringe-worthy.

""This wonât be an ââin universeâ âset story featuring the Doctor and his companion, but a historical drama about the people behind creation of the series, such as series creator Sydney Newman, producer Verity Lambert, and the First Doctor, William Hartnell, way back in 1963!""

and 

""An Adventure in Space and Time will tell the story of the genesis of Doctor Who since its first broadcast on 23 November 1963.  Exploring all aspects of the longest running science fiction series to date, the special one off 90 minute drama will also look at the many personalities involved in bringing the series to life.

 

Sherlock Creator/Doctor Who writer Mark GatissWritten by Mark Gatiss, it is Executive Produced by current Doctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat and Caroline Skinner.  The single drama was commissioned by Ben Stephenson Controller, Drama and Janice Hadlow, Controller of BBC TWO.

 

Mark Gatiss, Writer, said:

 

âThis is the story of how an unlikely set of brilliant people created a true Television original. And how an actor â William Hartnell â stereotyped in hard-man roles became a hero to millions of children. Iâve wanted to tell this story this for more years than I can remember! To make it happen for âDoctor Whoâs 50th birthday is quite simply a dream come trueâ.

 

Steven Moffat, Executive Producer, said:

 

âThe story of Doctor Who is the story of television â so itâs fitting in the anniversary year that we make our most important journey back in time to see how the TARDIS was launched.â

Miss Montague is the governess -- either a wholly fictious identity or stolen. This undermines your argument about  an orphan not becoming  an governess.

Maybe, since the nanogenes we saw in 1942, the writers have decided to go with a more realistic time frame. As the writer, Lois McMaster Bujold, said, ""I reserve the right to have a better idea."" 

If the Tardis can take the Doctor where he needs to go, she can control, or at least influence all her equipment. And, as she said, "" I exist across all space and time.""  So she knows the future and the past.

She knows that the Doctor needs to think that he is in control, that he does save the world, that he is the Doctor.  And since she knows the future, she only needs to intervene 1) By taking him where and when he is in a position to succeed, and do so spectacularly 2) Very occasionally subtly intervening to make sure who he needs is where and when she takes him. 

The Tardis has no need to intervene at the last moment of crisis in a Deus Ex Machina fashion because , existing  across all space and time, she knows what will happen and that he will succeed from the moment she takes him where he needs to go.  She does not take him where he will fail.

As for the teleport, the Tardis said, ""You're like a nine year old trying to rebuild a motorbike in his bedroom. And you never read the instructions."" The Doctor has never read the instructions to the Tardis. He is sorely uninformed about her capabilities.

And I doubt very much that the Doctor knows the Tardis inside and out.  He never read the instructions, and is too busy on his adventures to really scrutinize every little device and capability of the Tardis.  Besides, if the writers do have a better idea for the Tardis, it is better that way.

The problem with this style? Not episodic at all, which I feel NEEDS to be done in a show like Doctor Who. I love arcs and all, but without exploration and journeys that just break away from the story line entirely, they don't feel real at all. 

DoAS is one example. I LOVED that episode, but I felt that there were tie-ins to TATM that bogged it down. We all knew it was coming, so why force it into this episode at all? 

I loved the reveal of Big Bang 2, I loved the reveal of River being Melody being the night after Big Bang 2, and everything came together since Matt Smith first came on screen with that bumbling yet charming smile. It was a 2 season arc that I feel did it's job. I think Moffat as a writer needs to change his pace now for this new series to kick off.

Edit: I would also like to add that my initial reply started off as a joke but too many people took it too damned seriously and started this with me. These are just my opinions and I don't expect people to agree with me. But calling me a ""cock"" because of them is unnecessary. 

There are so many wonderful, amazing aspects to this show. Yes, David Tennant was a great Doctor. He was the reason I started watching the show. I may not have been a fan of how they wrote him off, but that doesn't mean I don't like Tennant or Ten. To say comments like ""Eleven isn't half the Doctor Ten is"" makes me feel like some of these fans watched the show solely for Tennant, and then stopped when he left. 

If that is the case, then you clearly do not know what Doctor Who is about. 

If you are genuinely a fan of the show and watch it, albeit slightly begrudgingly because Tennant is gone, then I'm sorry your favorite Doctor is gone. As I stated, I started watching Doctor Who for Tennant, but I started from the Series 1 reboot with Nine. I grew attached to Eccleston and by the time he regenerated to Tennant I was a bitter Betty for the next couple episodes.

Hazard unquestionably can play much much better than what we have seen as of late. He's a huge potential and he is on our team!

When Hazard hits his stride he will become the player that our opponents focus on and prepare for.

Unfortunately I don't see Hazard staying with the Blues for his entire career like Terry and Lamps, and I don't think he has shown real interest in doing that like Oscar, Luiz, Ramires, etc...

I hope he stays with the Blues for his whole career! I am a huge Hazard fan as I'm sure we all are.

Two more consistent themes...I think there may also be meaning in the theme of ""running"". In the library episodes one of the last things the doctor says as he's rushing to save River is let's go on ""one more run"", and then the Doctor's last words in the Snowmen are ""watch me run""...The second theme that is consistent are the veiled women in both episodes (the assistant in the library, and Vastra in the snowmen)

I think Moffat can write his way out of any of the possible holes in this theory...If you remember CAL ""forgot"" she had saved all those people so its possible that Clara forgets things too, leaves lots of openings in the writing to fill the holes.

First, we must review the character of Scaroth the Jagaroth from the Fourth Doctor story ""City of Death"":

http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Scaroth

Our unlucky Jagaroth suffered a warp-drive accident that caused him to be ""splintered"" in time, although his twelve selves could to some extent communicate telepathically with each other in their different times.

So, we have seen a Oswin that was converted to a Dalek in the future, we have seen an Oswin who was a governess in Victorian England, and at the last scene of ""The Snowmen"" we see an Oswin who seems to be in contemporary times. Two of these versions seem to know the Doctor is a ""clever boy"" and urge him to ""remember."" These both seem to share a interest in making soufflÃ©s. Does this not seem like limited telepathic linkage?

I'm beginning to wonder if the starship Alaska we saw in ""Asylum of the Daleks"" didn't come to its untimely end due to a warp-drive accident, and if Clara/Oswin wasn't splintered in time like poor old Scaroth?

true,NorthStarHomerun,tardis,TARDIS,"I'll admit that I've only been watching Doctor Who for a few months now and have only recently made it into the Moffat era. So far, here's what I've noticed:

My feelings on the series as a whole:

* Both David and Matt are excellent actors and both play The Doctor exceptionally well. 

* My favorite Doctor is the 10th, because I feel like David had a better idea of who the character is and his struggles. 

* Matt Smith started his tenure by doing a sort of impression of David but has grown into his own as The Doctor but I feel its too robotic. 

Of the RTD era:

* The characters and their relationships were the focus of the stories. This lead to several episodes having lackluster endings in the short term, but furthering a plot line I enjoyed more in the long run (example: S04E01, Partners in Crime)

Of the Moffat era:

* The details of the situation have become the focus of the stories, leaving them feeling very ""LOST-ish"" when they're clearly shooting for ""Inception-esk"" but missing the mark. Also, The Doctors relationship to his companion and humans has become confused. Best example of this being S05E11, He moves in with humans and suddenly forgets how they work, despite everything we've seen up until that point.",0,1356984154,null,0,false,0,c7ow857,t3_15py94,t1_c7ow857,t3_15py94,null,1430818637,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

first time he played for us (i think he was a sub against sunderland?) i was thinking Â£14m, really? he just ran around without achieving anything.

first sign of a real player was his sub appearance against man united, he really got us going again and was unlucky not to score.

he had good games and bad games last season and sometimes looked a bit timid. near the end of the season he bossed that chelsea match. and he won the young player golden samba award too.

he played quite a lot last season, possibly too much but i think in the end the experience made him a much better player. he looked like a player who had played a lot of short sided games, done lots of practice drills but didn't really understand how to put them into play in a proper game. (surprising as he'd played a lot already with sunderland).

this season he looks stronger,  much more confident and with much improved game intelligence. and he looks suited to rodgers style of play, with energetic, smart pressing and one/two touch passing. yet he's barely played? while when he hasn't played we've looked porous and disjointed in midfield. Lucas-Allen-Gerrard is on paper our best midfield but gave up goals on the counter against west brom and villa. lucas is way short of top form, allen is good but not the strongest physically and gerrard has struggled in away games against decent teams. jordan should be starting more often. and selling him would be ridiculous.",0,1356984184,null,0,false,0,c7ow8gg,t3_15pwz1,t1_c7ow8gg,t3_15pwz1,null,1430818642,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Often it seems like Moffat attempts to create episodes that are both standalones, and add to the overall plot arc, and in an attempt to do both, succeeds in doing neither.

A good example of this is The Time of the Angels/Flesh and Stone, which starts of as you would expect a standalone episode to start, introducing the bad guys and the dilemma the doctor needs to overcome.  Then, suddenly a crack in time is introduced, and the initial problem is almost brushed aside in order to focus on one of Moffats ongoing plot arcs.

People assume that thin = healthy, but in terms of how well your body functions eating barely anything and getting no exercise is worse for you than being on the chubby side and getting moderate exercise. 

All this is assuming you aren't snacking of course, if you're eating regularly, but not necessarily meals then it's not necessarily a detriment in anyway (assuming you're snacking on the right food of course.) I eat 6 times a day, but in small portions so I don't *really* have any meals as such (Never sit down at a table to eat), more like several lunch sized snacks throughout the day.

- The companions seem less real and more extreme. Say what you want about RTD, but he writes great companions. Each one of the New Doctor's older companions had their own flaws -- they just seem more human. Rose, Jackie and Mickey weren't that bright. Captain Jack was flirtatious to a fault, had attempted to con the Doctor and nearly caused a lot of bad things to happen.

Blake is referring to a native legend in which Jesus and Joseph of Arimathea visit Glastonbury and establish a 'New Jerusalem' as per the book of Revelations, but this does not take the form of a city, instead it is manifested in the English Church. This legend dates back in popular literature to at least the 14th c and probably much, much further in oral legend and is a common trope in Arthurian legend. It is a pre-Anglican idea that is adopted whole heartedly by Anglicanism that England is a holy land and the English are a chosen people. This goes back a long way in one form or another, the Bishopric of Canterbury had special status within the Universal Catholic Church very early on. When Henry VIII breaks from Rome he uses the unique status the English Church had historically enjoyed as part of his justification.  

The poem is contrasting the modern, industrialised world in which Blake finds himself with a pre-industrial rural idyll. This rejection of modernity and harking back to a mythically perfect past was one of the major tropes of the Romantic movement, it's the same reason Wordsworth writes about daffodils and Keats rehashes medieval ballads. It is also contrasting the notion of an erstwhile perfect, egalitarian English Church with the politicised, hierarchical nature of Anglicanism.  

The poem is a call to arms to recreate the 'New Jerusalem' which Jesus is meant to have founded. The idea that England was once a perfect society, ruled by a perfect Church, a 'Jerusalem' that was corrupted, would have been completely familiar to Blake's readers. The poem is pretty much just John of Gaunt's 'Sceptred Isle' speech from Shakespeare's King Richard II rewritten for the Industrial age.
