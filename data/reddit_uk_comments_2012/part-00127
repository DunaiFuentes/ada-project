For a more recent example - everyone knew of Prince Harry's nude photo...but The Sun printed it anyway.

Kelvin is part of the story. Why aren't they allowed to do this, when The Sun does it every day?

&gt;Or was it more likely a silly attempt to make C4 news appear morally superior to a tabloid editor?

Er...does that sound likely? C4 News doesn't *appear* to be morally superior than The Sun/ KM, they *are* - that's why it's funny that they adopted The Sun's methods. You work in the news and you need to ask this?

&gt;It's crass and stupid.

As are The Sun, and their methods, that's the point.

&gt;C4 should be reporting the news, not making it.

London - I would avoid if I were you, not because its a bad city (although my opinion is that it is) but it is the easiest city to visit as a tourist, so you would be missing out on the rest of the UK.

Northumbria - Newcastle and the North-east are interesting but isolated, but compared to the US that's probably nothing. The nightlife and sports culture in the North is big. Lot of students too.

Lancaster - Big pro and a big con with Lancaster, the pro is the awesome countryside, the con is how small the city is, with very little ""city stuff"" to do. It's not a million miles away from Manchester though, which IS worth a visit.

We need to see how far the Doctor can go, before we can truly appreciate why he chooses not to go there.

And here's the trick, you can understand what's going on.

Is it relatable to not be concerned with the fate of otherwise mortal enemies? Yes.  If you spend countless years in bitter war with another, you can see someone not being very concerned about a few of the enemies.

Is it relatable to desire quick 'justice' for a murderous war criminal?  Yes.  Just replace Jex with any upper tier Nazi and see where that discussion goes.

But the important thing is our history, we know the Doctor, we know the kind of man he is.  He's the mercy and the fury, he's compassion and he's cruelty, but most of all, he's kind.  

If that sounds a bit like the family of blood, well, good.  Consider that he *could* have killed them, or let them die on their own.  He instead punished them, but if you think on it, it's a punishment that could one day be lifted.  That he's judge and parole board may be a problem, but he still provides an option that may lead to the family being restored.

But none of this is the issue here. Something is wrong, something is very wrong with the Doctor.  The only question is, can it be solved before he takes a step too far?  Before he becomes that which he has spent so long fighting against?  Before he loses himself?

For politics I was asked about the democratic peace theory (not named as such, just had the theory explained to me) - it's the kind of thing that you really wouldn't be expected to know about before doing the course.

It forms part of the larger West Midlands conurbation, which has a population of 2,284,093 (2001 census) and also includes the city of Wolverhampton, the towns of the Black Country, and other towns such as Solihull. The City of Manchester has a population of 498,000 (2010 estimate), while the Greater Manchester Urban Area is home to 2,240,230 people (2001 census) and also includes the City of Salford, and towns like Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Rochdale and Stockport. The populations of Metropolitan counties such as the West Midlands and Greater Manchester are also moderately higher than those of the urban areas with both being approximately 2.6 million.

Also if you're looking for contract work (as you're looking for 2 months), it's unlikely you'll get taken on tbh as people want experienced contractors.

Off the top of my head, have you given any thought about what visa you would need to do what you want (coming here to work and play rugby)?  They're really cracking down on foreign nationals right now for visas with working possibilities.  As I see it you have three options: do a course here and your student visa will allow you 20h paid work per week (perhaps some 1 year diploma? be warned tuition fees are very high); apply for a [Tier 5 Youth Mobility Scheme Visa](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/working/tier5/youthmobilityscheme/) (formerly working holiday) 2-years tops, can work but must leave after 2 years; or get a sponsored [Tier 2 Work visa](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/working/tier2/) (that one is getting a bitch to get these days, lots of restrictions).  My suggestion is go through the UKBA (UK Borders Agency) website diligently, find what might or might not be possible for you, then find out how to fulfill the requirements for the best chance to get a visa.

It's rather silly that British and other EU citizens, who are assumed freedom to enter, are forced to wait longer than American, Chinese or Indian visitors. 

The way the lanes are laid out in Spain (at least in Madrid and Barcelona) seems much more reasonable to me:

* Only EU and EEA passports
* _Any_ passport

This way, EU citizens can use both queues and non-EU citizens never enjoy a comparative speed advantage.

I don't think that's unreasonable.

I should set my opinion out straight: I think there should be no limit at all what you take pictures of, although being aware that taking pictures of illegal things is a bad idea, the act of taking a picture itself is not illegal.

You can take pictures of people being naked, pictures of your children, pictures of murdering someone if you like (but don't be surprised if the police would like a word with you).

Printing the picture is where it changes. I accept the argument of freedom of press, and that it is in the public's interest to have the freedom to print pictures of people without their permission. e.g. a politician taking a bribe in a cafe with a shady individual.

But is there really any justification for printing photos of someone naked, when they don't want you to?

Maybe I enjoy visiting public nudity colonies. That is NOT the same as saying I want everyone in the land to see that. Privacy really is different when it comes to being naked, don't you agree?

So what if a politician is cheating on their wife? That is none of our business.

So what if J Lo has a boob job, again, not our business.

I can't see a scenario where someone being snapped naked is in the public's best interest.

It's no grand conspiracy. These courses (PPE at Oxford, SPS at Cambridge) are the best undergraduate education for an aspiring politician. 

The courses are so competitive that only the most able candidates receive places, so when you look at an aspiring politician with an Oxbridge degree you are looking at someone with both the will and the ability to succeed.

As long as entry to these courses remains meritocratic, and we are doing everything we can as a society to provide a level playing field for youngsters, I don't see anything wrong with this system.

&gt; The increasing ubiquity of these career politicians is in danger of choking out the ecosystem that used to allow people to succeed in politics from a number of disparate backgrounds.

It's an unfortunate side-effect of the democratic system we have. As I said above, there are plenty of people who know more about various subjects, so on and so forth, but for various reasons they don't become politicians.

Often that's just because these people aren't interested in becoming politicians. They make better money in private enterprise, they can maintain their integrity in academia, etc.",0,1348056299,null,0,false,0,c6adszp,t3_100x8w,t1_c6adszp,t1_c6add9b,null,1429937282,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

We do not need guns here at all. Escalation is the biggest result from arming police. There is also the matter of accidental police killings, which the USA sees regularly. I would rather see two brave officers who knew their profession was dangerous put in the line of fire from those who do not deserve their freedom (criminals) than putting the public in general in the way of every officer holding a gun. A single civilian being lost to accidental misfiring is absolutely not worth it.

There are even more points, but I'm preaching to the choir here, and giving the Yanks who visit this subreddit even more opportunities to start an unecessary argument.

PS. Another less obvious problem is that if more criminals get guns and policing becomes more dangerous, less intelligent and less qualified individuals will apply instead of the current higher quality individuals we have in the police.

You can talk to a ""bobby"" like they're a real person, you can ask for directions, and most of the time they're very civil, even friendly. But you try the same stuff in most countries and you'll get a rude response at best and they might even rest their hand on their gun ""just in case.""

I'd also argue that for many of the situations of the type you outline (drunken scuffles that you see on TV etc) that a police response is perhaps inappropriate also. The police aren't particulary trained and shouldn't be expected to effectively calm and diffuse drunken squabbles, so you occasionally end up with an excessively aggressive reaction to what could just be a minor drunken annoyance.

To be clear, for once I'm not blaming the police for this - I just don't think they're the appropriate tool for the job. Unfortunately, at the moment, they're the only one we have, aside from voluntary initiatives like the Street Pastors.

This is relevant because I think it shows that responding proportionately to the wide variety of incidents to which police may be called is an incredibly difficult task to judge even with the benefit of hindsight - less so in the heat of the moment.

You're right that there are generally fewer arms in the UK than other countries. I'll pick America because it's an easy comparison for the opposite end of the scale. 

But where America is concerned, it's not just that the police carry weapons - it's that the general public can as well.

true,CallidusUK,cnty-uk,Liverpool,"While I agree that our current attitude towards guns in the UK has been very successful, and a society without guns is the optimal solution. I can't help but play devil's advocate for one moment so please hear me out. 

.

I'm originally from Liverpool, where gun crime has seen a phenomenal rise over the last decade. We have young teenage lads hanging around residential estates right now armed with shotguns and cheap small arms. Shootings are very common, in certain areas still. Often used for intimidation, And certainly not uncommon to hear a distant gunshot in the evening. The idea that I live in a country that bans the use of a firearm results in a simple outcome. Law abiding citizens are disarmed, and those who don't choose to follow the law will arm at their pleasure if they so please. resulting in a nice unfair society where the bad guy holds true power.

.

Now, this is not an issue for the majority of the UK, and for that reason it certainly wouldn't carry much support. And little old Margaret from Southport doesn't need to carry a gun to stay safe. We all know this, it's just not British. But for those who have ever lived in a community where you know you are surrounded by people who are armed and are out to exploit the innocent. Well, can you tell me your human instinct doesn't rage at the thought of the unfairness that has been bestowed upon you. The inability to have the means to defend your family from scumbags like the guy who murdered those police officers in cold blood should a bunch of armed thugs come into your home one evening to have their way around your home? 

.

I don't know the solution. It's not as simple as allowing the population to arm themselves with guns. Our culture simply would not digest an idea. But fundamentally there is something that clashes with my raw human instincts when I look at the power balance. The British military needs arms to protect the security and interests of the state. The Police needs its arms to combat those who are of substantial danger to the public. But the common man who wishes to have the means to defend his family, and his home when he lives in a community that he knows is hostile has no such power.

I agree that the PPE and SPS course are the best undergraduate education for an aspiring politician, but would argue we are not well served in being governed by the politicians they produce.  Politics is becoming increasingly homogenised as people are not developing their own beliefs and ideologies through experience, but are increasingly being taught the same political orthodoxies.  This is fuelling the undignified fight to the centre that we see in today's political parties, by which many people have become disillusioned.

I don't think that it is the democratic system that has led us here per se, as the PPE types who are tipped for high office are very often given safe seats through their parties to ease them in to political life.  The bias towards the PPE graduates occurs at a party level, and further denudes the voters of genuine choice.  As 'career politicians' become the norm, it will become more and more difficult for other people to enter politics by other routes, regardless of their willingness or suitability.

I don't wish to belittle the talent or ability of PPE graduates as a whole, as many are clearly bright and driven people who enter politics with good intentions.

We already have civil partnerships which give gay couples the same legal rights as straight ones, if we did not have this then I would have a problem. But everyone is on equal footing when it comes to the law, which is good.

I'm not religious at all if that makes my point any different. I understand it's 'cool' and 'hip' these days to support gay marriage but when looking at it from a logical standpoint it just makes no sense.

You suggested he was entitled to such a bonus because he worked odd shifts and bank holidays - not due to his 'skill set'. The point is that however you define 'hard work' - the difference in earnings between those at the bottom and those at the top has increased wildly in the past couple of decades - and it's **not** due to lack of 'hard work' by those at the bottom (FWIW I don't even really class your dad as one of those 'at the top').

Nobody mentioned entitlement. He gets a bonus based on the performance of the company. When the company does well they get a share of the profits. When it doesn't do well they don't get anything. Which has happened in the 13 years he has been there.

I'm sure it's easy from a position of minimum wage to feel anger at someone earning £10-15k bonus. The reality is that he wasn't simply handed such a position, he had to work hard for it and has been doing so for over 30 years.

Those that see it as separate and equal at the moment will continue to think of it as that even if the name is changed (in the same way that I see a holiday in France and a holiday in Spain both as a holiday, but in different countries).  The rights that one has mean that it is equivalent to a normal marriage at the moment anyway in all but name (and I think most appreciate that this is fine if it placates the religious people).

Those that see it as lesser and inferior will think of it as lesser and inferior even if it called marriage as they have preconceived ideas about marriage being between a woman and a man.  Changing the name won't change their attitudes.

The only ones I can see with would affect the way they think in society are a small minority of people who want to do gay marriage and not a civil ceremony and a small minority of people who think that 'marriage' should remain as it is.

There also apparently recorded accounts of same sex marriage in ancient Rome, Greece and China. 

Certainly no religious group should be forced to perform such, but neither should they have a veto over others whether religious or not, to act as gatekeeper for marriage. For instance in the UK there are religious groups (e.g. Quakers, Liberal Jews, Unitarians, etc.) which want to be able to marry same sex couples, but because of the views of the main stream faiths are prevented from doing so.

Equality isn't tolerance, having a ""separate but equal"" institution for same sex relationships enshrines in law that same sex couples are somehow lesser, not quite deserving of the same status of others.

true,misterdave,null,null,"ok, I should've said I'm familiar with the internal workings of a television, having run a tv repair workshop for about 8 years in the days before LCD and disposability. These are the 2 suggestions I've debunked so far.

Detecting the BFO of the radio receiver sounds like an appealing idea, but it would be difficult to detect such a small signal, through shielding, in a noisy environment like a house, even from the same room. Modern manufacturing standards for RF emissions dictate that the shielding should be good enough to prevent these RF emissions, rendering this technique useless. Operation rafter only worked on primitive valve and early transistor equipment from the 1950s/60s.

It has been suggested to me that the line oscillator is what they detect, I last heard this suggestion before LCD televisions were available. You can tune a radio to the frequency of (a harmonic of?) the line oscillator and sometimes detect that the television is turned on, but it does not prove that broadcast television signals are being received. These days, it doesn't even suggest that broadcast television signals are probably being received, as many televisions are used for game consoles etc. 

Another nail-in-the-coffin for both these techniques is antenna size, because the frequencies are very low a directional antenna would be massive. At 455khz a 3 element yagi antenna would be roughly a thousand feet square, I'd like to see them get that on top of a detector van!

How much in bonus payments has he received over the last few years while the entire country has been struggling through recession?

I get bonus payments against the performance of my company too, but for some reason only a few hundred quid rather then a few thousand (and that was in the 'good' years). I work at a fairly high level within my field, but then I work in Engineering.

You are half-right in what your saying; hard work and ambition can make a big difference in remuneration, but just as important is the industry you work in. If you work in the finance industry you're effectively on a completely different pay scale to someone in retail, or in engineering, or media. The average graduate starting salary was £29k this year; £30k for banking, £26.5k for Engineering, £45k for investment banking.

Of course its daft to get angry at any particular individual for a systematic problem in earnings. But neither is it sensible to pretend that these people 'deserve' such vastly inflated salaries through virtue of their efforts; its not what they do so much as where they do it.

This is where I find a lot of issues with New Who, and people who watch it (for the first time), and this episode in particular. A lot of people (at least a lot that I know) act like this is the Doctor ACTUALLY DYING. Like Tennant and Smith aren't playing the same character. Like they aren't the same man. I don't know why it happens, probably because people had so much time to love Ten, but... 

He will always be the same man. Everchanging, but always the same. Always here to help, always curious, always strange. 

I would say that no part of the Doctor ever dies. While regeneration is strange, it marks a change in his persona that has manifested over the season(s). 

When Nine became Ten (a much sadder change for me, because I love(d) Nine so much more (and probably forever will)), it had to do with Nine finally finding something in this world worth loving: Rose. And he became a new man, figuratively and literally, because of it. 

When Ten becomes Eleven, it's more about, in my eyes, his love for everyone. I think that's why Ten both needed and got more time, because he had learned to love, but needed to learn why. That's why a huge part of his arc is losing Rose - because he has to cast his newfound love onto something new: mankind. 

Remember how Ten had that habit of insulting people? and ""not recognizing"" it? That's him. Grouchy, angry at people, madly in love with Rose (though TGitF always made me question that one), and not above being a little (or a lot) rude. 

I also think it's big that one of the most notable quotes of Matt Smith as The Doctor is ""Nobody important? Blimey, that's amazing. You know that in nine hundred years of time and space and I've never met anybody who wasn't important before."" Everyone is important now, not just Rose, not just his companions, and not just the planet. And all of the random people that he just calls ""brilliant"" in nearly every episode?

I even think it's significant that he has the two companions. It's a break from New Who tradition, and its symbolic. It's not just a pretty woman, like it always was before. It's a man and a woman. Together. Assisted by The Doctor. It's about more than just one. 

The Doctor, reeling from the Time War, needed to save something, to save himself.

true,Xander_7,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;There's not a gun culture in this country in the public

I'm rather afraid that you're somewhat mistaken. There is a thriving sports shooting and hunting culture alive and strong in this country. You're surrounded by people who enjoy nothing more than a quiet Sunday afternoon spent shooting clay pigeons, a Wednesday afternoon behind a scoped rifle working on their marksmanship or a massive summer competition with hundreds of people showing off their skills with a firearm.

~~Even if~~ Especially if you are 'anti-gun', find your local range or clay ground and book a lesson. Sports shooting is highly rewarding, and should help give you a more informed view of guns and gun ownership in Britain.

Domestic gun ownership and violent gun crime are very rarely related. If the crime involved a handgun or large calibre semi-automatic then the guns were not obtained legally. You cannot legally own a firearm in this country with the intent to use it for personal or home defence.


You don't have to be a 'gun-nut' to appreciate the skill shown by a competent marksman or to enjoy a session of clay pigeon shooting when the weather's nice.

Anyway, even with the 12 lives to spare, I wouldn't change really from what I do now.  Weigh the risk/benefit, and not waste any regenerations needlessly, but still have fun!  I'd love to skydive now, and I don't have the lives to spare.  So why not do it when I do?  

I probably would be afraid of regenerating and losing who I am *now*, but at the same time, I'll still be me, just different.  It would be fun finding out who the new me is.  I'd take it even if gender and ethnicity and whatnot can change.  

Second scenario...if there's a choice to wait, I would.  But if not, I'd still probably take it.  

And either scenario, I'd want my close friends and/or family to have the option too...or at the very least, my kids.  I'd still want them to be able to outlive me.  The friends bit is just for companionship, more than anything.  

Speaking of, would any kids I could conceivably have in the future gain the ability just through mine (I'm assuming DNA has been altered)?  Would passing on the ability matter if I'm male or female?

I always pictured regeneration a bit like this: say your very sad and upset about something, your mind is intensely locked on a subject or in a manner of thinking, and you havent slept in a couple days, you know you have to sleep, but you dont want to, because when you wake up, all your pain anger and thoughts will have blended into your brain and added to your general knowledge, making you not a man with an idea but a new man with a greater knowledge. You will effectively have changed who you were but not at the same time. I know its not a perfect explanation and there are certainly things that would be of greater impact but this is my little more or less applicable theory.

Scenario two: Do you mean you have a choice (once your 12 regenerations are acquired) to take the pill or no?

2) The predictability of the pound shop pricing makes it easy to calculate your spend if you have only a little money to start with.

true,Eurisko,null,null,"I thought while each Doctor was the same person, they exhibited different character traits with each new body and that the 10th Doctor was just reacting differently the way he reacted differently to other situations.  I also thought he thought he was going to die for real, i.e. not regenerate, which would explain his sadness as well as the 11th Doctor's glee as he confirmed he had all the normal body parts--quite a different regeneration altogether from the previous one--""Mmmm....new teeth. Oh, hello!""

To me the 10th Doctor also had a stronger sense of self-identity than the other two. He seemed more attached to *who he was.* Evidence would be the Family of Blood episodes--being a Timelord carries risk. He wanted to just live out his days as the person he was.  Just being who he was and enjoying the body he was in seemed preferable to him than the trappings of time travel.

I also think that the 10th Doctor's sorrow was a great tribute to Tennant and his fans. Tennant seemed much more devoted to his role than Eccleston--he just seemed so into it, so enthusiastic. To me, his ""I don't want to go,"" was almost Tennant talking.  Eccleston wanted to go. They couldn't even get him to do two seasons, two measly seasons. I liked Eccleston, but there was something withheld, wasn't there? But to me Tennant went out on a very positive note--""I've loved my time here, I don't want it to end."" Yeah, it was sad, but I think that particular moment had as much to do with Tennant as the Doctor--""I don't want to go, this has been a pleasure."" It's a more respectful way to leave than, ""SEEYA!""  

I definitely think he's ""in there somewhere""--even more than just in there. He's the same person, he's not dead. Look at your life. If you jumped from your age now to yourself 20 years ago or 20 years in the future, you would find that you were something of a different person. While I'm the same person I was 20 years ago, I'm also very different. I'd have a different brain, different emotions, a different body. I reacted to things 20 years ago way differently than I do today. We all become different people, so to speak, as we go through life. Sometimes I look back and I miss the innocence I used to have. Life can harden you. The 10th Doctor had an enthusiasm and ""joie de vivre"" the 9th lacked. It seemed to be a personality he was particularly attached to, a version of himself that he enjoyed more than the others. That's why he was sad, in my opinion. But it's nothing to be sad about to the viewer, other than being sad to see *Tennant* go.

true,misterjta,uk,Shropshire Lad,"Yeah, that's a very valid point (and one which I think Peel was big on). The authority of the Police comes from the fact the exist to represent and protect society's laws. It doesn't/shouldn't come from the fact they have guns.

And I think people do respect the police. Yes, you get bad apples (and for some reason all the high-profile bad apples seem to gravitate to the Met...) but at the end of the day, they come over as decent people that you could chat to in a pub.

Generally, seeing police about gives me a sense of security: clearly nothing's likely to happen when there are police about. The exact opposite is true when I see armed police - I don't think that there's less likely to be trouble, instead I worry that if there *is* trouble I might end up stopping a stray bullet. 

It's easy to trust someone who seems basically likeable.

true,WhoMouse,tardis,TARDIS,"I understand what you're saying.  But, I think faith is based on trust.  I think faith is more forward looking than trust though.  I have faith that the sun will rise tomorrow because I trust the science.  I have faith that the Doctor will beat the Daleks when he next meets them because I trust his record with them is accurate.  

I see trust is justification for faith, but people base their trust on different things, too.  Some people have faith the world will end in December because they trust a Mayan calendar.  It's the same problem with trust as with faith - is there evidence based justification or not?  

I guess I see it as: You trust the evidence, and when you extrapolate from the evidence, you're turning it into faith.  Trust mixed with hope that the justification remains true, or something like that.  Faith is trust on loan from the future.  Faith is trust in things not written yet.

&gt; Why have a second version of a word when there's already a word for it.

The English language is funny like that.  Faith, belief, trust, hope, etc. are all so closely related and intertwined, but none make the distinction between evidence based and not, really.  It leads to a great deal of people's individual interpretations taking hold when you examine it close like this, as far as I can tell.

&gt; complete trust or confidence in someone or something

Which really doesn't fit either of our definitions.  With both of ours, trust will change if the evidence changes.  And it doesn't say anything about what that trust or confidence is based on/not based on. 

[Trust](http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/trust?region=us&amp;q=trust) is:

&gt; firm belief in the reliability, truth, ability, or strength of someone or something

Which could fit both, until you hit the first example:

&gt; acceptance of the truth of a statement without evidence or investigation

at which point, things go haywire with both our definitions.

Since we're tracking words through definitions, [belief](http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/belief?region=us&amp;q=belief) is:

&gt; an acceptance that a statement is true or that something exists, *or* trust, faith, or confidence in someone or something

Which brings us full circle back to trust and faith.  None of them are firmly evidence based/not by definition.  It's all how we interpret the different words on an individual level as to how fully trustworthy (heh) we find them.

(off the top of my head #9 killed the Spiderwoman creature early on after giving her one last chance. #10 amongst other things was vastly crueler to the Family of Blood in letting them live) 

Even in the previous episode, the Doctor let the missiles target Salomon's craft with him in it at the end after learning of his genocide of the Silurians on the ship. 
The Doctor has been pretty consistent throughout this reboot about giving one last chance and making good on that threat. The underlying rage and guilt of the Doctor has actually been somewhat lacking in the story lines for this incarnation if you ask me. 

But I do agree that there has been somewhat of a shift in tone and pacing and general direction this series. It's become a bit darker and a bit sillier all at the same time and with a lot more of the visual flair that's been kind of a hallmark of the Sherlock series.

I have been trying to wrap my head around the reason why the ponds were companions to the Doctor since two episodes after the crack in the wall.

The 8th Doctor presumably had been travelling alone for who knows how after his regeneration and defeating the master and closing the eye of harmony in 2000 A.D. 

Sometime afterward he was killed again somehow, and forced to regenerate into the 9th Doctor picking up a companion from 2005 AD, Rose Tyler after she had proven that she was ""brilliant"". 

The Doctor does not pick up companions willy nilly, and his default is to travel alone. Amy is waaaaaaaay off base, rather Moffat is waaaaaaay off base, if that is what he thinks the Doctor is.

true,Mynameisaw,yorkshire,West Yorkshire,"&gt;The idea that I live in a country that bans the use of a firearm results in a simple outcome. Law abiding citizens are disarmed, and those who don't choose to follow the law will arm at their pleasure if they so please. resulting in a nice unfair society where the bad guy holds true power.

This is honestly the most ridiculous reasoning I've ever heard.

Lets put it this way, currently, guns are extremely hard to get in the UK, you need to know a guy who knows a guy who knows about a boat landing at 3am. 

And you're trying to say, allowing the general populace to wield a firearm will *decrease* crime? What uninformed bullshit is that? America, with all it's legal firearm rights, has the highest gun related crime per capita in the western world, on top of that it has the highest crime rate *in the world.*

&gt;The inability to have the means to defend your family from scumbags like the guy who murdered those police officers in cold blood should a bunch of armed thugs come into your home one evening to have their way around your home?

And how often do 'armed thugs' come into your house? I suggest, if you live in that sort of area, to invest in a alarmed safety bolted door. That way those 'armed thugs' who regularly enter your house will find it much harder to do so without alerting the police (who by the way, have an armed response unit for such occasions.)

Okay here's some valid reasons,

Gun crime is at an all time low in the UK.

In the past 15 years, only 6 officers have been killed in firearm related incidents. 

It's a waste of tax payers money in context to the threat level. 

We already have Armed Response Unit's who are much better trained than your average bobby would be and deal with the majority of gun related incidents in the UK far more effectively.

true,Variola13,null,null,"&gt;No, even if you are taking 'Triple Science' (which is pretty pointless) you're still mandated to study core science. Whereas the 'Double Science' (nearly everyone does this, it bears no difference to uni application; universities are looking for grades, not the number of GCSEs) students only take: core science, chemistry twice, Biology twice, and Physics twice - triple students will do this with one more GCSE which combines P3, C2 and B3.

Actually yes... all students have to study science as a core subject, but it does differ with which GCSE you take, they can decide which to take in yrs 10/11.  It is not a triple science as they are 3 separate subjects, and taught as such and are not condensed into one mark. It does very from school to school. 

As for it being pretty pointless, it matters a lot if you are going into a career which involves science in some way! The number of GCSEs as well as the grade affects the UCAS points and the admissions system, so Universities do look at both, and it can be a deciding factor when a student is borderline if they have to choose between two.

But seriously, don't feel bad/awkward for your own reaction either way.  If you feel like crying, do.  If not, don't.  People react differently...that's life.  It'd be pretty boring if we all acted or reacted to different fictional characters and situations the same way.  We'd never get different characters to love!  They'd all be basically clones.  And nobody should be telling anyone else here that they *should* cry at any point, nor should they be told they shouldn't.  

Just like some people prefer different companions or incarnations of the Doctor and some prefer different ones, some people are more emotional overall, some are just with this particular show, and some aren't no matter how much they like the show.

Other than that, remember, this is the internet.  It's not like there's ever exaggeration used to make a point.  

That said, I echo TheGallifreyan's sentiment - I have cried buckets over this show.  A few years ago (10-ish counts as a few, right?), I didn't cry for *anything*, and that would have included this show.  I still don't cry over most shows.  This show gets me though.

However, in this country, firearm ownership is extremely limited and most of the general public do not have access to firearms.  Even the typical argument that criminals will always get guns if they are illegal is void because we do have sections of the police that are armed for these circumstances.  It doesn't make sense to arm the entire police when they are unlikely to need access to a firearm.

true,Variola13,null,null,"&gt;I have two family members studying medicine at a top tier uni - both studied double science at GCSE. In regards to UCAS points, the better the grade the more the UCAS points.

Oddly enough medicine doesn't require that much science, certainly not as much as an engineering or a biochemist or physicist would need. 

&gt;Lets face it, most applications are decided on A-Level results rather than GCSE. I would still find it more beneficial to study Double - I know students who are getting lower grades than me in triple due to the added workload.

That I agree with, no point sweating over another GCSE when you can get 2 grades better with one less. 

&gt;If you ask me, I'd say go with Double, especially if you're taking more than one humanity. I don't know if Oxford/Cambridge prefer grades though I'll assume if you're applying to those you have All A*'s.

I have a MSc in Genetics.... so it is not all that relevant to me :-) 

However my son is studying the 3 sciences, he has already finished 2 GCSEs in History and Geography, and is now making his Geog up to AS level by doing an extra year of it. That is an alternative to taking another GCSE, because the choices on offer didn't appeal.  It seems to be a good way of doing it as there is choice of science levels, rather than everyone sitting the same papers and coming out with low marks. I got double E for my 'integrated science' as it was called back then, and now I am a scientist, go figure. :-)

true,jimofwales,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"Gas is going to be keeping the lights on well passed 2050, whatever way you look at it.

Sizewell B was the last nuke plant built in the UK and cost £3.7bn (adjusted for inflation) with entirely public money, and is only half the size of this Pembrokeshire monster. You can chuck another billion on there (at least) for decommissioning as well. So equivalent nuke at today's prices you'd probably be looking at 10bn for 2GW.

Wind is the most mature renewable energy, you have to build 3GW of wind to displace 1GW of conventional power. So to displace this gas plant you'd have to build 6GW of wind. This is slightly lower than the UK's entire installed wind capacity - 3,873 (both onshore and offshore). 

This gas plant took 3 years, building another 4,000 turbines in the UK is going to be incredibly difficult with current NIMBYism. 

Obviously, it's not all the simple as you have to buy the fuel for a gas plant, which isn't going to be cheap. You need to look at levelised cost of energy, but gas still wins at present, but nuke looks slightly more attractive. But that still doesn't take into account decommissioning, waste storage, let alone any disaster (eek!). We're still not really taking into account externalities, gas loses ground there definitely if you're serious about climate change.

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"The Chelsea performance today was a huge improvement to our previous ones. I know it is not easy to believe that right now after slipping victory through the fingers but just watch this match again. 

- We passed better 

- We passed faster

- We created more space 

- We got more shots on goal

- David Luiz becoming more responsible

- Haz-Mat split open the entire Juve midfield and defense on their own

- Better tackling, more 50/50 won.

- Cunt bag ref

- Decent crosses from both sides, No one to finish them though

- Obedient Oscar, told to watch Pirlo, becomes Pirlo. Given #11, becomes Drogba.

- Finally making ambitious passes. The way we get the ball from defense into the other box is fast and sexy but after that again the finishing is lacking.
 

______
Here is what I think we need to do:-

1) Switch between Torres and Sturridge as the lone striker. 

2) Defense needs to improve. Ivanovic leaves so much space on the right that the wing player gets inside our box before Ivanovic comes closer. We were also playing a much higher line than usual which suits Cahill, though it is understandable why we raised our defensive line against Juventus.

3) Try more midfield combinations. Include Marin when he gets fit who is going to be an important goal scorer for us. Oscar deserves to flourish via game time. Hazard and Mata playing with Oscar would just make me splooge. Mikel needs to be more consistent. He plays some very solid games but makes very critical mistakes in others that cost us. When you have a player like that then they have to be Yaya Toure so that these mistakes are understandable but when your main and probably only job is to hold the midfield then you need to keep your slate clean.

4) Hazard has been denied 2 solid penalties in 2 games. He should keep on doing what he does. Fuck these incompetent referees with double standards. If a player is taken down by another via clear contact then you should not become a saint and claim that ""he was looking for it"" because outside the box you would give him the same foul calling it a ""professional foul that he was looking for so he got it"". Today's penalty was 100% a penalty. 1 push, 3 times contact with his ankles and never touched the ball or got close to it. Ball was still in play, what the fuck was that douche nozzle smoking?.

All and all I'm not pleased with the result but I can definitely see the improvement and honestly speaking we are far from our best which is inevitable. And let me tell you, the way we played today will still get us out of the group stages. During this time we will be constantly improving as we are game by game.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; And does it matter whether I am doing medical training or not? If I earn more, must I pay more for my education?

This doesn't really occur in this case, in the sense that someone earning £100k a year doesn't pay any more for tuition than someone earning £40k. But it is true that, in general, this is the quid pro quo for living in a society like ours. Talented people are given opportunities to put themselves in elite positions, all sorts of services are subsidized by the general population to give them those opportunities. For doctors, they are subsequently paid handsomely by the public, with their salary rising to perhaps six or seven times the median wage. Part of what they give back is a higher percentage of their earnings in tax. If tuition came entirely from income tax, you'd be paying a higher percentage to pay for the next generation, as high wage earners have done before.

In terms of the question of debt, I think the problem was that debt was taken on for the purposes of speculation, not investment. If the nation has limited means, and it can either train one engineer without debt, or two engineers with debt, and the engineer is going to earn back many times their tuition costs throughout their life, that is a good investment, and good use of debt financing.

My problem isn't with the mechanism they used to introduce tuition fees, it's that they used it simply to reduce the long term deficit. Spending per student and staff:student ratios halved from 1980 to 1990, and have only recovered about half-way back to 1980 levels, the recovery due to Labour's tuition fee increases. The Coalition hijacked this mechanism, to do something which looked similar on the outside, but inside, as I say, they were using the money to pay off the national debt, not to increase tuition funding back to where it should be.

Also, there's a specific issue with medical training, in that the costs of tuition are far higher than £9000 a year, so you're still being heavily subsidized, and would have been more so in the past. I mean, you talk about £40,000 of quasi-debt, but American medical students are saddled with hundreds of thousands of dollars debt, which they still have to pay if they earn less, and which doesn't expire. And then, there was a massive trend for UK medical students to take their free, entirely publicly funded educations, and emigrate to America, where the salaries match the debt. Britain, to fill this gap, ships in doctors from developing countries, which causes extraordinary damage to the health systems of some of the poorest countries in the world. 

So, medical students now pay a percentage of their tuition costs (probably about a third to a half), but they've also had their wages [massively increased over general wage inflation](http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/images/2010/Jul/NHS-GP-Pay.gif), to try and persuade them to stay in the country. You can see there that the medical wage inflation alone pays for tuition fees within a year. So doctors have been treated pretty well over the last decade, I think. Not to mention the application of the working time directive, which means that medical trainees in particular no longer work the insane hours they used to, ten or twenty years ago.

Going by previous chelsea transfer tactics lemme break it down!

* Falcao has said he wants to play in England (aka PL) 
 
 * Chelsea were linked to him before the SC final and since he destroyed them even more so, if he wants to go, Chelsea will more than likely spend 38m **POUNDS** on him (Falcao was bought for 40m **EUROs** or roughly 31m pounds) 

* Chelsea will more than likely give him a disgraceful weekly pay rise, on a level that AM will likely be unable to match

* Chelsea were arguably one of the best teams in the Prem and Europe last season Winning the FA cup and the CL final and are currently top of the PL, plus they have that sex appeal especially with all the new signings they brought in, they look like they'll stay in there winning ways

* He's 26 and in his prime. The older strikers get the more injury prone they become (for the most part) they also get slower, easier to fatigue, loss of agility, few big teams have strikers past the age of 28

* We didnt want to sell Torres or Alonso but look how that turned out, when money gets involved and a player has made his mind up theres not a lot the club can do, because if the player doesnt want to be somewhere his performance will show it

Not really, here they are traditionally a breeding ground for new talent. The stars of the longest running/most successful programmes here were unknowns when they started. Of course they get paid more now but the shows are successful too.

QI is the exception to that but even then the contributors aren't all massive stars

&gt; maybe longer for those that don't rely on speed.

No he really is in his prime, he's a athletic striker who main tools are his speed and agility, if you think there going to keep getting sharper when he hits 28-30..well, no I got nothing its very unlikely to happen

38 is a still a bigger number than 37, also that performance bonus goes to **him** not the club as its a performance bonus so the number stays at 40m Euro's

Doesnt need to threaten when he said he wants to play in the PL some day, wouldnt be retarded at all Most strikers lose value as they get older unless they can maintain there level of play

When Amelia is giving him different food, at one point he says ""Are you trying to poison me?""

He says something about cowboys in the crack in the wall.

Amy was praying to Santa at the very beginning.  She also has Christmas lights on her bed at the end.  Christmas has been mentioned several times this season.

The duck pond with no ducks.

Rory's nametag said 1990.  Yes, it's been dismissed as a prop error by Moffat.  However, he's under no obligation to tell us the truth.

Prisoner Zero's first form was a man named Barney.  Cameo by Neil Patrick Harris? (yeah, it's a stretch)

During the conference call scene, the Doctor gives them a few bits of science, including proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, why electrons have mass, and faster than light travel.

Jeff is going to be offered ""any job he wants"".  I always did wonder what happened to him.

During the big ""everything goes to 0 scene"", there's a shot on a cherub angel with a bow and arrow.  Significant?

I'm really too busy to check other episodes, but at the end in the TARDIS, the flippy-clock (is there a name for those clocks?) has 3 numbers.  The first two are revolving quickly, but the third is static, 56.  5 was the number of rooms Amy thought were in the house, 6 is how many were really there.  5+6=11.

The BBC's Series 4 FAQ[9] suggests that now the Time Lord social order has been destroyed, the Doctor may be able to circumvent the limit on regenerations; it says: ""Now that his people are gone, who knows? Time Lords used to have 13 lives."" In Death of the Doctor (a 2010 The Sarah Jane Adventures serial), the Eleventh Doctor responds to a question from Clyde Langer by saying he can regenerate ""507"" times. Early news reports, before the episode was broadcast, suggested he would say there is no limit to the number of regenerations.[10] Writer Russell T Davies explained in an interview with SFX that the line was not intended to be taken seriously and is instead a commentary. He insisted that the ""thirteen lives"" rule was too deeply entrenched in the viewer consciousness for his throwaway line to affect it.[11]

I think based on this, we can sadly say that the Doctor probably won't have 507 regenerations.

Juventus played a high pressing game against us, and for the majority, we were sitting back in our half. Quite a few of the players expected to run onto the ball, not come towards it... Torres struggles to play back to goal on long balls, so there are not that many passing opportunities for Mikel. 

I think the major problem with the second goal was Terry trying to play offside on the edge of the eighteen yard box, which is a very risky game to play, and did not pay off today.

true,pbhj,uk,.,"&gt;*if the sole purpose of marriage is to assist the 'procreation and raising of children' then older couples, infertile couples and those who simply don't want children would not be able to get married* //

The historical, traditional and predominant current purpose for marriage is providing a stable social environment to benefit the raising of children. That some who get married are unable to do this is effectively an abberation caused by lack of intrusive investigation by the body honouring the marriage (state, church, temple, ...). The state support for marriage, as for community support, has not been dependent on the actual ability to procreate because the foundation of a stable social (and physical) environment requires that the union be able to be approved long before the actual ability to conceive has been established. 

Insistence by the state to only allow marriage for those who could conceive has obviously traditionally not been possible however it has been the case that fore knowledge of inability to conceive be used as a reason to nullify a marriage. Other causes to consider a marriage void include failure to complete the marriage by physical union.

General fitness to conceive might now be able to be established prior to marriage but most people would consider such testing to be over-intrusive.

Personally I believe that if a state wants to officially endorse their approvement of [longer term] partnerships - presumably under the assumption that this will benefit stability of society? [¹] - then they can adopt a civil partnership available to any pairing of adults. 

Clearly sexual union as a precursor to conception is irrelevant to civil partnerships and so IMO the formulation of such partnerships should be entirely blind to claimed sexual action between the parties. Probably to be fair such partnerships should also allow any number of parties to be so ""partnered"" - unless it can be established scientifically that such multi-party partnerships be detrimental to the purpose of ¹ above (whatever that purpose is?).

Then the state could alter financial dealings with individuals according to their condition of being in a civil partnership or not.

To my mind I'd be married but eschew a civil partnership - the state would be required to treat me as an individual. Such a situation would have benefitted me in nearly all financial dealings I've had with the government in the UK.",0,1348098281,null,0,false,0,c6anvb6,t3_104rsd,t1_c6anvb6,t1_c6amkj5,null,1429942309,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"My opinion on the matter: 

* Mikel was making a lot more defensive contributions than Essien, and with a weaker midfield presence too. Where Mikel only had Lampard to partner him, Essien was joined with Alonso and Khedira, two solid central midfielders. Those 9 interceptions in particular is quite impressive for me. Him and Luiz did great in that department tonight.

* Essien was playing a lot further forward, evidenced by more key passes and shots. 

* I found that him losing possession four times to be surprisingly high, he never used to do that. Defensive mistakes happen, Xabi Alonso was at fault for Kolarov's goal last night. 

* The deeper you play the more dangerous your mistakes are, because you play further up and they aren't as noticeable doesn't mean they don't occur. For the record, I think JT was more at fault for the second goal than Mikel. He needed to be holding that line much better.

* That Mikel gives the ball away 4-5 times per game is just wrong. His passing is typically much better than tonight (he averages around 90+%) and is rarely caught in possession. His game tonight was a bit lower than his standards but Juve are tough opposition, Vidal, Marchisio and Pirlo were quite good tonight. 

* I also didn't think Essien was a standout performer, and his pace is noticeably lacking by a step or two. I'd love for him to be an option for us, but I'd play him beside Mikel, not replacing him.",0,1348099496,null,0,false,0,c6ao5r4,t3_105tqq,t1_c6ao5r4,t1_c6ao0wz,null,1429942447,4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,4

The question would be answered if... well, if it were answerable at all.

Several problems with it.

1) The Doctor doesn't even know how old he really is. How would he measure it? Earth years, Gallifreyan years... what? Does he even really care? I think he just guesses to pacify people who ask

2) They're both time travelers. It's impossible to measure where they're at? I mean, in the Doctor's personal timeline... Jack's already dead (Well, still alive, but you know what I mean). And so how would you determine where it ends? We don't know when The Doctor will die either.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; Sizewell B was the last nuke plant built in the UK and cost £3.7bn (adjusted for inflation) with entirely public money, and is only half the size of this Pembrokeshire monster. You can chuck another billion on there (at least) for decommissioning as well. So equivalent nuke at today's prices you'd probably be looking at 10bn for 2GW.

&gt; ...

&gt; Obviously, it's not all the simple as you have to buy the fuel for a gas plant, which isn't going to be cheap. 

Leading with all this stuff about capital costs is pretty misleading. That final sentence is some understatement. [This study](http://www.pbworld.com/pdfs/regional/uk_europe/decc_2153-electricity-generation-cost-model-2011.pdf) by Parsons Brinckerhoff, on behalf of DECC, says that fuels costs will make up 61% for a Gas plant built now, and capital costs 12% (p16). The equivalent for nuclear is 7% for fuel, and 75% capital. Capital costs are more or less useless as an indicator of total costs.

We should be building far more nuclear plants, although it's also clear that gas has a big role to play. Not least because, as you say, you can chuck them up within three years (after we've pissed away the time which would allow us to do anything else).",0,1348103146,null,0,false,0,c6ap10u,t3_1051wm,t1_c6ap10u,t1_c6akzz2,null,1429942859,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

He gives it away with a poor pass, under little to no pressure. Then, instead of moving into the whopping great gap in front of him that the Juve player runs into, to apply minimal defence pressure, he stands still and allows the killer pass to be played. The whole defence seemed to sit back too much. Even on the first goal Mikel and the defence were so static that when it came to Vidal (who was unmarked), we were caught out. This is a worrying trend. I was very underwhelmed by Terry, Ivanovic, Mikel and Ramires, and it's not the first time this season those names are being mentioned.

------------Mikel---------------------

Moese--------------------Mata------

-----------Hazard-------------------

----Sturridge----------Torres--------

As long as Di Matteo doesn't allow the defense 
to get help from the wingers we will always concede
sloppily and easily. Most of the time it our right back and 
left back against the other team left back or right backs and wingers
so it make it easy for them to play the ball back and forth and easily pass
by us and create chances for their strikers, when the 2 pivots players try to track the run the space they left in front of goal remains open. we need the top half to fulfill their defensive contributions. Look at Hazard on Juventus first goal his challenge on Vidal was weak if he had pressure him enough Vidal wasn't going to have chance to shoot.

Our solution to how the game going shouldn't be put in Bertrand we have other options on the bench that can change the outcome of the game. the Bertrand system only work when we're playing teams with really good wingers like Bayern/Barcelona/Madrid. We went through hell to get Moses, Oscar and Caesar but they are being wasted on bench while RDM play his faviorte 11 [Cech, Ivanovic, Luiz, Terry, A.Cole, Mikel, Ramires, Lampard, Mata, Hazard, Torres] I think after the first 2 games every teams figure out how one dimensional we are. Now we have Hazard cover every second of the game. and Torres for the sake of the love and support we've given you just play as a fucking striker and stop drifting out of position the entire games. when there a cross in the box there is no Torres when Hazard finally drifts free with the ball Torres is either stuck behind a defender or no where to be found. We need to be able to change formation during game when the one were using is not working. Rotate players more often to keep them fresh we have cover for every position so far. we have too much talent to be losing 4-1 or drawing with QPR or today. And the fucking media i dont care who the hell we play we're not good enough to win that game and we keep on proving them right, look at all the shit we as a fans read about how Pirlo will tear us apart he was quiet for most of the game the only time i saw him was when Oscar did the spin and curve.

true,TLKv3,null,null,"46:15 into ""The Eleventh Hour"", you can actually freeze frame the image of a statue of a Cupid-like Angel with a Bow &amp; Arrow aimed down towards the street, on the side of the billboard's ""00000"" message. It's also night time.

If I assume correctly, the location The Doctor is explaining his ""0"" message about is in the UK. Which means it's still relatively night time over in America. Which means, the Cupid Angel is taking aim simultaneously as The Doctor is explaining ""0"". My assumption is the digital billboard is actually in Manhattan and is about to shoot Amy, but Rory will piece it together and push her out of the way and take the arrow for her. Afterward, The Doctor/Amy go to visit Rory's grave (the shots of the Graveyard with only The Doctor/Amy present for Episode 5) and they encounter the same Angel that ordered the shot. And Amy will confront it and be killed next to Rory's grave as The Doctor is forced to retreat or risk losing the TARDIS to the Angel while he goes to her. Effectively leaving her there to be discovered by someone else instead of him, Angels guarding the area in case he were to come back later.

So with The Doctor in isolation after both companion's deaths he'll begin traveling backwards through Amy/Rory's life to ""run away"" from their fate (all the odd mis-matching of a timeline we've got in Series 7 so far) until he finally meets Clara/Oswin in Episode 1 and learns to ""let go"" and then goes off to find her.",0,1348111300,null,0,false,0,c6aqut0,t3_105c44,t1_c6aqut0,t3_105c44,null,1429943668,10,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,10

It's just a theory that I posted here a couple months ago, but I keep seeing these allusions to the innocent people that die in the course of the Doctor's many good deeds. How insane would it be if Karen Gillan's small role in Fires of Pompeii was really Amy, sent back by the Angels, making it so the Doctor couldn't save her because he has already killed her?

Maybe not under that circumstance, but if the Angels do get her I reckon they'll send her back to a place the Doctor won't be able to save her from, and that place just might be somewhere that she'll get killed in the crossfire of something the Doctor did already. 

TL;DR I think if the Angels send Amy back, it'll be to a place where the Doctor will already have killed her and therefore won't be able to save her.

It was selfishly turning Ten's regeneration into a terrible tragedy and turned the audience against Eleven, which is wholly unfair to the following cast and crew.

Liverpool's gotta snatch talent in places where people aren't too keen at looking , avoid bullshit with clubs that have absurd buyout clauses/co ownerships. Quality is key as well, you gotta make sure the player can be consistent and meet the workload. I'll admit Downing, Hendo, Adam had all solid 10/11 seasons, it was attractive to make a move for them. Of course it sorta bit us in the ass.

For fun(for the nth billionth time), if I had a say, Ricky Van Wolfswinkel would be a big boost.

It's interesting. I thought that it was very much in character. It really showed the struggle that the Doctor has gone through whenever he had decided to not kill and go the long away (instead of just killing whatever was the problem to spare everyone else). As Kahler-Jex says ""We all carry our prisons with us. Mine is my past, yours is your morality."" Its a hard decision- kill one and save the lives of many OR spare one and risk the lives of many. Back up plans do not always succeed. 

It reminds us WHY the doctor always has companions - to stop him from becoming too violent, too powerful. For example, 10 in the Waters of Mars.

Either way, I tend to think that Dzeko scores goals more by luck than judgement, look at the finish of the one against Real - right through the middle of the keeper. He also can have a use, but he's not big and strong enough to be the centre forward, and his skill (or lack of) often breaks up moves. He misses more chances than he scores, that's for sure, but somehow has a knack of picking up important goals - which is why the crowd love him. A combination of him being a good bloke, an old fashioned centre forward, scoring a few and also having a great song about him explains why he's so popular.

As for Kolarov, he's a good attacking full back, but not a great winger/midfielder nor is he a good defensive full back (but a good defensive winger). Caught in the middle, a little bit.",0,1348116476,null,0,false,0,c6as158,t3_104x6r,t1_c6as158,t3_104x6r,null,1429944243,0,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,0

Boswell, John (1994). Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe. Oxford and New York: Villard Books.

Bret Hinsch (1992). Passions of the cut sleeve: the male homosexual tradition in China. University of California Press.

The main argument for not accepting same sex marriage is that marriage is something 'owned' by the church, with unchanged roots back into the origins of Christian belief. This sole stewardship of marriage is rather challenged if it can be shown that others were doing it prior to and separate from the Abrahamic faiths, that it has arisen elsewhere in the world in different forms.


&gt;By definition of the term 'marriage' they can't

My argument is that marriage as a concept is far from as inflexible as the mainstream faiths make out. That while they have taken a particular interpretation of it as being solely between a man and a woman, that other forms have and now do exist. That marriage is a concept that has and thus can change, that the ;dictionary definition' of marriage is irrelevant.


&gt;Why? Why not just decide that your default is that civil partnerships are ""greater"" and marriages are lesser? Wouldn't that solve the problem for the ""some"" you speak of.

A separate water fountain can be a gilded as the other only other people are allowed to drink from, but its still separate and the distinction that you are part of some distinct (and lesser?) group not quite deserving of the same privileges is still there by it's very existence.

Legally civil partnerships and marriage are equivalent in the UK, the main difference being that by law civil partnerships cannot have any religious elements, that they can not take place in a church. For many religion is an important part of their lives, even for many same sex couples. If a church is willing to marry them should they be prevented from doing so as they current are? Certainly no church should be forced to conduct such services, but neither should one religious group have a veto over others.",0,1348121278,null,0,false,0,c6aswxo,t3_104rsd,t1_c6aswxo,t1_c6ao0c0,null,1429944638,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

2. The duck pond had no ducks due to the cracks in the universe. The ducks no longer existed, yet Amy still somehow knew it was a pond where ducks lived.

3. The ""Rory's Nametag"" thing is a production error, same as the moving ""Marshall"" badge and the magical disappearing Dalek head light. Same as in ""The End of Time pt 2"" when you watch the Timelords walking across the narrow platform and you see their cloaks ""mysteriously"" float over the edge of the platform. A show about time travel, the props department are bound to make a mistake on a tiny detail like that.

4. The rest of your points are just filler dialogue, misinterpretations or things which add to the charm of the series.

- ""There have been some cowboys in here. Not actual cowboys, though that can happen"" is definitely not worth reading into, remember that the doctor didn't know what the crack was at that point.
- ""Are you trying to poison me?"" is a statement he made on his dislike of bacon. Nothing more.
- They're fairy lights, not specifically ""Christmas lights"". She was praying to Santa, as a 7 year old might do, considering the linkage between Santa and Christianity. This is Steven Moffat's sense of humour bleeding through into the writing.
- Barney Stinson has absolutely no relevance to Doctor Who.
- The Doctor was proving to everyone in the conference call that he's the authority on all things such as this. He showed them these equations to gain their trust and to get them working.

The other three you've pointed out I can't explain and could potentially be used by Moffat in season 7. The 56 is likely nothing however, as there is a divider between that number and the rest of the clock.

See, the difference is while you may *think* you know about gun crime coming from the scary Liverpool, here's some facts for you:

In 2011 there were only 11,227 reported crimes involving firearms, 0.3% of the number of total reported crimes.

Only 9.3% of homicides in 2011 involved a firearm.

Out of all firearm related crime, 23% involves the use of imitation weapons. 

Out of those 11,227 reported crimes, in only 37% of cases was the firearm actually discharged.

In 80% of cases no one was harmed, and the total number of injuries/deaths from firearm related incidents was 388. 

Since 2002 the number of firearm related incidents has dropped by nearly 50%.

Which is exactly what The Sun does - why should this not be reported on? And it's The Sun that created this method, not C4 News; otherwise that's like saying by reporting on a protest you're actually encouraging it in the first place and therefore shouldn't be there.

&gt;Making them no better than the tabloids. 

Yes, because doing it once to highlight someone else doing it is exactly the same as that someone doing it for several decades. Sorry, you're still using logic The Sun likes to employ to justify their actions.

&gt;It isn't C4's job to influence the public

So illustrating what happens if everyone follows The Sun's methods is now 'influencing people'? Well, we wouldn't want that.

&gt;all they have to do is report the news in a clear, informative and unbiased fashion. 

Which is exactly what they did. They didn't invent this journalism, they're highlighting how low-level it is by doing it to someone that's pretended for far too long that there's nothing wrong in doing so and has quite happily done it to hundreds of people over the course of his tenure under the ultimate excuse of 'it sells papers' and nothing else. You certainly can't then apply the faults they're reporting on to the journalist that's doing it; you may as well claim that a journo buying some crack in Brixton to show how easy it is is just another drug addict and encouraging the drug trade; in short, ignore the context all you like, but that does not make it go away.

&gt;That's what a good news service does.

And still do. Reporting on dodgy practices of papers like The Sun, I'd say, is long overdue.

&gt;C4 have demonstrated themselves to have just as big an agenda as the tabloids and broadsheets they so regularly sneer at.

Not sure how you make that leap. They're highlighting dodgy journalistic practices, of which there apparently isn't nearly enough considering you're quite happy to lambast them for doing so (by ignoring the context in a truly tabloid-like manner).

The tabloids (and a lot of the broadsheets) *deserve* to be sneered at, the attitude of 'oh, that was *yesterday*' being used as a coverall for whatever is done in the name of selling copy has to be dealt with.

Tuition fees are not ideal but have been shown to effect richer students more than poorer. See 'More or Less's' statistical analysis

2)Enterprise zones set up to encourage business in areas of low growth
3)Business banks
4)Scrapping ID cards

While I think it's too early to be writing him off - he has scored three times already - his attitude in the QPR game, coupled with being completely anonymous against Juventus are somewhat worrying.

He's closer to his Liverpool form than he ever has been since we bought him, but that doesn't mean he's anywhere near it yet. The only saving grace he has is that he's almost certainly going to be given plenty of time to play his way into form, as I can't see Sturridge being given the lone striker role anytime soon.

If you notice now, the fans don't sing his name as they used to, I didn't hear it even once yesterday. At the game you see the whole of the action, while TV cameras tend to focus on where the ball is only. We've all seen his runs when we begin to break and he tends to just stand between two defenders most of the time, a pretty useless place to be. There are none of those defence splitting runs that people could pick out with a good through ball, he tends to come deeper, collect the ball outside the box and then dawdle on it long enough to the point where he has to rely on trickery to get round a defender, usually losing the ball in the process

It's frustrating to see, especially if you're watching the players in the final third take their shape as someone is bringing the ball upfield, people tend to leave the central area clear for him so he can turn and run but he hardly bothers anymore.

For example I've read that Romans, at least in one period, would pair younger and older men and that often homosexual sex was part of that pairing but that the expected action was that citizens would marry in order to start a family regardless of what sexual acts they preferred. 

Indeed I'd say that Roman and Greek marriages seem to be directed strongly towards procreation from all I've read hence - so perhaps you could outline maybe one particular example from each citation (with a page reference preferably, please) that supports your position OR demonstrates same-sex [sexual] partnerships being supported by the state in the same way that marriage was and the benefit or outcome of that support??

The atmosphere was downright poor. Not a match on the Hull or Blackburn games.

I don't think that there was a group of 3, 000 Leeds fans anywhere in the stadium - we were all scattered around in much smaller, fragmented groups.

I was slightly disappointed by the protest inside the group. I was hoping that a significant chunk of the south stand would be filled by protestors, singing anti-Bates songs for 90 minutes, but there were so few people there! I'm not going to criticise them too heavily, because I respect them for what they did, but I'm glad that Bates wasn't in attendance because it literally looked like a small minority.

true,myimportantthoughts,cnty-uk,It's grim up North London,"This is a good question.  I would go for:
1) Youth unemployment. This is a hugely damaging problem that we will still seeing consequences of in 25 years. This is related to the problem that the average degree is becoming less and less valuable. What caused this? Poor careers advice and poor economy, exacerbated by cuts and low demand. 
2) How are we going to pay for care for the elderly. Most elderly people do not wish to pay for their care, or to see higher income taxes, or higher inheritance taxes. Sucessive govt.s have refused to address the issue.
3) Inequality. It is insane to me that we have millions of people living in poverty, including many children, when we are such a wealth country. Other people have talked about the rising cost of fuel/food, which is a key issue. However, we have enough resources to feed ourselves, we just distribute resources inefficiently. The problem is people voting against their economic interests, like poor people voting conservative. 

So how do we fix these problems?
1) We need serious, personalized career advice for everyone in the county, especially in schools and universities. For young people, it should not be an option to be a NEET, not because the government forces them do work, but because there are so many opportunities on offer. Work, education or apprenticeships should be available for everyone. 'Internships' where people are not paid minimum wage for doing a 'real' job must be ended, with extremely high fines for companies who do this. People can not be employed for free by anyone. We should enact new deal style policies of 'creating' work by putting on theater productions (possibly for free), taking care of public parks, and rebuilding/renovating public and private property. This gives people a job, and they will then go out and spend, stimulating demand. This means other companies will go out and hire people. 
2) This is easy, we need to significantly raise the level of inheritance tax in the UK. This should apply to people receiving money from relatives overseas. Also, we need to raise far more in corporation tax from large companies in the UK, and there should be no more dodgy deals over lunch for FTSE 100 companies with the taxman. Charities should also be investigated, and most should be re designated as companies. Eton is not a charity that benefits society. Building a fat mosque or church or synagogue is not benefiting society. Giving money to the royal opera house is not really benefiting society, it is a hobby. 
Giving money to fund cancer research or to a homeless charity is of benefit to society. No more tax breaks for millionaires who give to charity either. This would pay for elderly care. Finally, we need better education about lifestyle choices and more subsidised sports facilities that are available to everyone. There should be more choice in school sport.
3) Again, more taxation and redistribution of income. Tax on gambling, alcohol, tobacco etc should double or triple. Better education, in particular career help and sex education will prevent teen pregnancies, which can lead to generations problems when no-one gets a job or decent education. We need a large tax on buy-to-let people and second home-ers who simply drive up the price of property and hog property that others need. Also, it should not be acceptable to leave a property empty. If people cannot fill it within a year, the government should forcibly buy it at 80% value and sell it to someone who will live in it.

None of it is ideal, Duece could operate as a loan forward, his work rate could certainly help us but he has always seemed to work best with a striker in front of him so i would hope using him in that manner would be a short term solution. Realistically Demebele (granted small window to speak about) looks like he is able to link the midfield to the forwards, probably not a great idea to move him. 

Moving Bale off the wing may be what he wants to do, but we always look much more threatening when he is out on the left rather than roaming around the field plus he is also our cover for LB with Disco nicked up.

For example, in England, at present, most of the money goes to Primary Care Trusts, which cover a preset geographical area, employ General Practicioners, and then commission services from other organizations, particularly the hospitals, which are usually separate foundations. The hospitals also get some separate income for emergency care.

In future that's going to shift so that the Primary Care Trusts are no longer geographically locked. A General Practicioner will be able to choose to join or leave them, or indeed create their own, depending on his or her judgment of their efficiency and competence, and thus they've been renamed GP Commissioning Consortia. I believe there's also a shift so that it's now easier for these consortia to commission services from private providers.

Read my original post please. Look at what it is I'm actually fucking saying. The problem with people like yourself is you don't actually bother reading. You just like to prove a point to raise your bloody ego. 

.

Let's try again. You're simply quoting gun crime to somehow tell me I somehow should not be concerned. My point is not only gun crime. The UK has a violent crime rate that is the highest Europe and has been often higher than the US time and time again. Our little island, that has strict gun laws has one of the most violent crime rates in the west. So tell me, when gangs like the above who have entered homes in the middle of the night and are a smashing a claw hammer in the face of a loved one. What then? I'm sure your bloody stats will serve me just fine to protect myself.  Go on, how many knives get used each year in the UK? Because it's the same problem. You're still fucked by the law with the inability to defend yourself against armed aggressors. So if you actually *read* my original post instead of frothing at the mouth to argue with me, you would see I didn't once ask to be handed the right to bare arms, I simply pointed out the human in me hates the fact I have absolutely zero measures to protect myself lawfully against any deadly weapon if 3 or 4 thugs come into my home armed with deadly weapons (the UK has the highest knife crime in Europe, and the USA) But go on, respond to this and tell me it's all fine. Keep your head under the sand. I don't lose a seconds sleep thinking of such issues. I'm a tall strong guy who keeps fit, I train, I fight for sport, and I'm somebody who feels I'm always going to have an advantage against an aggressor. But let's face it, In the UK if somebody wants to walk into your home at night, and have their way with you or your family they can if they're armed. You can't do jack against a guy who is going to put a bullet in your daughter's head if you attempt to defend yourself. And that's the simple result of a state that is disarmed by the law. However small those encounters may be, that is something that doesn't sit well with my instincts.

We are not yet at the point of having an established/settled first eleven, who are comfortable and capable of playing in the style that is now required.

We are still finding out some of the capabilities of the players, and whether/how they can play in a post Drogba team/style.

I do think there is a question mark over Lampard and his current starting selection. 

It's great that we are top of the table, and Hazard has made an impressive start, but I do not expect this to be the default position for the rest of the season. Our main rivals are not having to live with the same impact of personnel, style and cultural changes as our team.

Realistically anything over a top 4 finish in the league, later stages of the CL and a decent shout of a cup should be looked on as a better than expected result.

Bedding in these new players and changing the style of play that has served us for so long is what I want to see, which will then see us reaping the benefits in the seasons/years to come given the comparative ages of the players we have bought versus those we have let go/are nearing the end of their time with us.

He knows we have a packed fixture list in the coming weeks, that we were playing a team with an extra days rest to us and imo chose to rest Doumbia and SEB and sent the team out to try and hang on at 0-0 until the later minutes when he could bring those two on to try and snatch something which we did.

Tactically, i agree with Mancinis decsion to play Nastasic ahead of Lescott. Mancini knew that we wouldnt have much time on the ball and so opted for a full back who was more comfortable on the ball. It was a big ask for a 19 year old to debut against Madrid but i Nastasic stood up to the challenge.

Im looking forward to seeing the new formation more often. It allows Maicon and Kolarov to play as wingback and push further upfield assisting the midfield. Kolarov has never looked defensively astute but has a [left foot which can cause damage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsDznEvS4yI).
Maicon offers more protection than Kolarov but at 31 isnt the fastest.

We should've started with the wingback system in Madrid (we eventually did after Nasri went off injured)

I didnt like Mancinis comments at Joe Hart, but i think a lot is lost in translation. A few more years in the country should sort this out. (I always prefer David Platts interviews, you can always guess what Robertos going to say...""For me ....""

Hopefully, under Mancini, we will witness greatness. Whatever happens, we can be assured that the future is Blue!

Quick summary: you pay for an insurance (90-150~ euro per month) and they pay your healthcare costs. At an insurance company you can choose several policies that best fit your needs. Do you want complete dental care, or very little? Glasses? No glasses? Etc. You can also opt to increase your own liability beyond the standard 220 euro (now raised to 350). This means that if you have a problem with something, in the majority of cases you have to front the first 220 euro yourself unless otherwise specified in your policy. This resets every year. You can increase it willingly by an extra 100-500 euro so you can lower your policy by 5-20 euro per month. 


The system works, but the amount of money required to keep the healthcare *affordable* for everyone - mostly because the care for the elderly is increasing exponentially - is a tough task. They are looking into income based premiums. I.e. Using arbitrary numbers, someone earning 20K would pay 100 euro per month whereas someone earning 200K would pay 500 euro per month for the same policy.


Another big problem we have is that a lot of people can't afford to pay their own insurance, so the government fronts you money. If your total income as a single person is below ~35.000 euro, the government gives you a grant. If it's below ~52.000 euro as a registered partnership, you also receive a grant. A quick Google number put me at roughly 5.2 million (out of 17 million, and the working population is roughly 6 million...) people who receive government grants to pay for their healthcare costs. The grant is a stipend of up to 69 euro per month as of 2012, depending on how much you earn.


Basically, a lot of people can't even afford to pay the premiums in the first place. There are also a large number of people, 300.000 or so, who don't pay their mandatory monthly insurance. This is another big problem.",0,1348144667,null,0,1348145165,0,c6avecg,t3_106n98,t1_c6avecg,t1_c6av7ym,null,1429945878,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

From the beginning of the RTD era through Flesh and Stone, he claimed to be 900-907 years old. In The Impossible Astronaut he says he's 1100, and in A Town Called Mercy he says he's 1200. But all the way back in the '70s, the *Third* Doctor told Liz Shaw that his life spanned ""thousands of years."" Yet later the Fourth Doctor told Sarah Jane (I think) that he was 745.

On the other hand the First Doctor regenerated in part because he was so old. We don't know how old, but we do know that Eleven has lived two hundred years in the last two series with almost no external evidence of age. How old does a Time Lord have to be to show the kind of advanced age that the First Doctor showed? Pretty freaking old, I'd imagine.

In other words, the Doctor's age is basically impossible to establish. I'm inclined to think that the most accurate estimate we have is Three's ""thousands of years"" and that the Doctor himself only occasionally keeps track, hence the various other numbers.

If they say they will not raise taxes on socks (picked at random as its a bit safer then anything else I could think of) and then raise taxes on socks then they are held accountable and a new election is called and whoever is leader is thrown out of politics for a fixed time.
This is what I see as a large problem in politics, the broken promises made to get elected. We saw it with Labour and the no top up fees, referendum on the EU treaty. Both promised and both broken. 
If we were to make sure these politicians knew that if they did not do what the people want them to do then they are losing that power.

Just to clarify, there's no payment for most services in Britain. Most people pay National Insurance, but it's really nothing more than an extra income tax that goes towards paying for the NHS. I get the impression, however, that this means that GPs have a stronger 'gatekeeper' role, so people sometimes might have to push to get treatment, and you might find the process more adversarial than in Holland. The exceptions for no payment are prescription costs (a flat fee of about £7 for each prescription), and dental and eyecare/glasses services, where the system is essentially private, with some limited public support for the poor and the elderly.

The End of Time pt 2 was my own personal nadir in the history of the show. It's the one episode I cannot bear to ever watch again. My family ended up throwing leftover bits of New Year dinner at the screen.

Mawkish, self-indulgent teeny-melodrama drivel from start to finish, a one-man circlejerk love letter to himself from an increasingly drippy RTD, with abysmal back-of-a-beermat will-this-do? storytelling, (the Time Lords back! the Time Lords gone again like a pop-up pirate), leading up to the real meat of the episode: an excruciatingly corny farewell tour of all Davies' most-loved companions, extended to the point that it feels like some kind of absurd encore to a grim pantomime. Poor Tennant dutifully wears his 'solemn' expression throughout, and then, to top it all off, we end on a disgustingly unprofessional poisoned chalice to the new crew.

Tennant deserved to go out with his head held high, proud and fantastic, not with a regretful whimper. And how the hell are you meant to carry on from an ending like that? No wonder Series 5 seemed like a completely different programme - it had to be.

My opinion is that this lousy self-serving ending is what has lead to such a schism in the fanbase, with a dismayingly large number of viewers stopping dead at the moment Tennant left, finding themselves unwilling to move on almost three years later.

I'm still stunned at the sheer lack of taste and judgement on RTD's part. He really should have known better - or been stopped by his colleagues. I generally pretend to myself that Tennant left at the end of Series 4, as he probably should have done.

If it's time limited and actual experience/training, then yes. This already happens via the above schemes. Besides, there is already a reduced NMW for young workers. 

&gt;The reason the youth cant get jobs is because of the archaic idea that minimum wage helps young people.

The reason *anyone* struggles to get a job at the moment is the dire state of our economy. 

&gt;Its not ""defecting blame"" its a logical idea when we need ""new"" ideas to increase employment. Or you know we could keep the status quo and hope companies will start hiring more people

It only serves to increase barriers for those who need these jobs the most.

I love Torres. He's my favorite player, but he's just not performing how he needs to be, given the type of service he's currently getting/where he's getting the ball. He seems to get the ball in spots where it would require very tight, controlled dribbling to get into a shooting position (Corner of the box and end line, outside of the box). Players like Messi and Aguero accomplish this frequently, but he doesn't have the foot skill that they do.

I also think there's shared responsibility with the service he's getting. The runs he's making put him in the aforementioned bad spots. His positioning is also poor at times. Tracking back too far to recover the ball is a problem that springs to mind. He needs to work that out. The other part of it is complicated. Our attacking mids get so close to the box and get so narrow that Torres has nowhere to go but out of the box. This is why I want Moses and Marin to get some playing time.

I took a very low paid job upon leaving school (lived on doll noodles for two years, jacket potatoes for another two), because I recognised that I'd be gaining in experience what I was losing financially.

This MP is simply laying out the job market like it is, where you have to get out and do more than the next person unless you're convinced a CEO role is going to just land in your lap as soon as the last schoolbell rings.

true,SuperSonic4,eu,Burrrmin'am,"&gt; I took a very low paid job upon leaving school (lived on doll noodles for two years, jacket potatoes for another two), because I recognised that I'd be gaining in experience what I was losing financially.

Fair enough but you still need some kind of financial support to do that with the price of housing (or keep money if your parents don't have the money to keep you after their child benefit/tax credit stops), fuel, food and travel. Working more than 16 hours per week you can forget about benefits (including passported benefits) no matter how much of a pittance you earn and no working tax credit for under 25s unless you have a child.

**tl;dr - working for less than minimum wage requires money from elsewhere (and some might say working at the minimum wage is the same)**

&gt; This MP is simply laying out the job market like it is, where you have to get out and do more than the next person unless you're convinced a CEO role is going to just land in your lap as soon as the last schoolbell rings. 

A well-paid role (or inheritance) will just land in your lap if you belong to the right social class. The Royal Family is the most obvious with politicians being next.
It is true for most of us though, indeed even harder thanks to nepotism and the retardation of social mobility.

&gt; He doesn't 'suggest people should busk', he points out the lengths to which some people have gone to secure a job, and tbh he's right about experience; it stands you in much, much better stead when you're up against school leavers who have a computer sciences degree but don't know what a DHCP relay is.

Fancy an MP not having a clue what catch-22 is. Or perhaps he simply doesn't care. Just **try** getting a job with no experience in that sector, let alone none at all. There can be no denying it's an employer's market at the moment and it logically follows that employers wish to drive down wages, conditions and choose to hire those with years of experience.
Our government is needed more than ever to maintain pay and conditions are not eroded and people are not taken advantage of by unscrupulous employers. Alas they are failing and age discrimination is rife but acceptable because it's only young people who are basically feral if you real certain media outlets.

true,JetSetWilly,null,null,"""Quality of life"" is a wooly metric and it depends what you enjoy to do. For example, if you are really into seeing the latest west end theatre productions, perhaps living in the sticks is not for you. If like myself you enjoy gardening, walking places, cycling, going to the beach - then perhaps it is.

There's also occupational matters to consider. I can get work around here without difficulty. It may be different if you are in an obscure occupation. However, I could double or even treble my income in London. My girlfriend, a teacher, certainly could not - a london weighting is only a small amount extra.  

I am in Kilmarnock, in SW Scotland. The advantage of this arrangement is, I get a reasonably large house with a nice big long victorian garden, in an OK area of the town - whereas I could forget being able to afford the equivalent in Glasgow, much less London. I commute to work in the city centre in Glasgow. This is about 25 miles, and takes about 40 minutes by bus.

However, I am in a technical occupation so I can and do work from home fairly frequently. 3 days at home this week in fact. The bus does a nice ten journey ticket that is valid over 28 days so the savings over the train are significant.

The question of where is best to live depends on what you consider the features of a high quality of life to be, and whether you have the skills to maximise the likelihood of attaining it in a particular part of the country.",0,1348154860,null,0,false,0,c6axew5,t3_106utn,t1_c6axew5,t3_106utn,null,1429946825,5,false,UKFrugal,t5_2u4mi,5
true,LordAnubis12,null,null,"Brighton here. Moved down from Rugby a year ago because my boyfriend was going to uni here and it was a convenient time for me to move to somewhere a bit more exciting/interesting. 

Prices were a shock I guess - I was paying 525pcm for a studio room (with water/ctax included) which could get me a 3 bed semi in Rugby. Not that I'd want to - you get what you pay for here I think. I now live with my partner and we pay 725 for a 1 bedroom flat though it's a fair size and fairly central.

Really close to London, lots of job prospects in the local area. I currently work part time at Sainsburys while I'm doing OU degree which suits me as I get a few days off to go into town and explore or just hang out generally. There's always something to do. The advantage is it's quite small so even walking everywhere I can be on the seafront in 25 minutes - walk to work takes 15mins or less. 

I can't really see myself leaving Brighton in the next few years anyway. It's a great city and feels very accepting and homely. While many places in the UK now are more accepting, being a gay couple here isn't unusual or seen as anything than just a relationship which is nice. Even in Rugby it had a slight stigma of being different, here people just don't really care. 

So far my experience of the Quality of life has been very good - services are all very accessible and sensibly run with good opening hours etc. Library building is just great here and council services very accessible.

He was leaning on leaving the club and decided to walk around the town to think over it. While he walked he met numerous fans who loved him and told him that they wanted him to stay. They convinced him to stay for another year which he played amazing football. Rafa still decided to shop around and Barry was high on the list. That's when Rafa sold Xabi to  Real Madrid for funds to buy Barry who instead went to City. I don't believe Xabi wanted to leave but I think his relationship with Rafa was a little bitter.

(1) MPs are clueless about the internet, hence crap laws such as the Digital Economy Act. 

Reasons: see [this blog post](http://cabalamat.wordpress.com/2012/05/12/why-politicians-dont-get-the-internet/)

Solution: elect a [Pirate](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/) government

(2) We have a crap electoral system, first past the post, which means that a party can have 100% of the power on just over a third of the vote.

Solution: switch to proportional representation

Reasons this has not happened: the Conservative and Labour parties benefit from the current system, so are unlikely to change it

(3) house prices are too high

Solution: build more houses and especially more social housing

Reasons this has not happened: (a) high house prices hurt first time buyers but benefit last-time sellers. Since last time sellers are typically old, and old people are more likely to vote than young people, the big parties don't want to do anything about it, since they think it might be a vote loser.

If someone is involved in a mugging, a policeman having a gun isnt going to stop them being mugged, or stabbed if they resist. Muggers dont look at the policeman coming towards them and think, ""oh it doesnt matter if I continue mugging this person cause they dont have a gun""

If someone has been taken hostage, then armed police are going to be dispatched anyway?

The ONLY situation where a gun could even possibly improve the situation, is when a group of men with guns burgle something and a police officer is on hand RIGHT away outside the building to keep them inside it. And even then, our police force isnt going to want to send a police officer in to a building instead of armed response.

Your final point is ridiculous, youre comparing a group of people trained to potentially the highest standard militarily, placed in a WARZONE surrounded by people who are intent on trying to kill them, to a group of people whose main job is to deal with drunks at closing time. Youre also not saying youre proud of the police, youre saying you want them to be armed with guns. See the difference.

true,[deleted],null,null,"When we switched over to 3 in the back, our right side was left horribly exposed because Kompany was having issues coming over to cover and was having a lot of trouble dealing with Ronaldo and Marcelo.  Marcelo would push forward into the space left by Maicon and Maicon was having problems tracking back.  So Mancini put on Zabaleta to play right wing-back.

At this point we lead 1-0.  Instead of sitting back and defending, Zabaleta continued to push forward, which allowed Marcelo to get in behind him and all of a sudden you have Kompany having to deal with the best winger in the world and one of the best attacking fullbacks in the world.  This wasn't an issue on the other side of the pitch because Clichy is used to playing wide and Di Maria and Arbaloa aren't the same sort of threat that Ronaldo and Marcelo are (although they are both very good, Arbaloa is nowhere near as good as Marcelo going forward).  Instead of playing an even back three, they played like an off-kilter back four, with Nastasic still generally playing to the left of Real's loan, central striker Higuain.  This left Kompany in a tough position.  His instinct is to stay central, but there was no one out right and so he would get dragged wide by Ronaldo, which left space for Marcelo to cut into the middle, where Nastasic wasn't picking him up because he was dealing with Higuain (and then Benzema) and Clichy was too wide left.  This is what lead to Real's first goal - roughly two minutes after Zabaleta came on as a sub, Marcelo found space, cut inside and scored a very well taken goal.

Even after this happened, Zabaleta continued to push too far up the pitch and also got drawn into a central position (which is how he ended up being in front of the goal when he missed an absolute sitter.  While we enjoy Zabaleta's forward runs in the EPL, it was foolish and irresponsible of him not to sit deeper when Ronaldo and Marcelo were consistently getting forward, putting in crosses and ultimately scoring from City's right side.

While Kompany has taken some heat for apparently ducking out of the way of Ronaldo's shot, it was Zabaleta who showed him onto his right foot instead of pushing him outside onto his left.  It's defending 101 to not make that sort of mistake on one of the best right-footed shooters currently playing and it was this clumsy attempt to defend Ronaldo that led to the third goal right at the death.  It was his poor positioning that led to both Real's first and third goals, which leads me to the conclusion that either Mancini did not properly instruct Zabaleta about his defensive duties or that Zabaleta ignored them/got confused/whatever and ended up way out of position at crucial moments in the last 15 minutes of the game.",0,1348160235,null,0,false,0,c6aytd6,t3_105clt,t1_c6aytd6,t1_c6av4el,null,1429947498,6,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,6

No rumours from anyone at all about any kind of hitch on the side of the consortium and then all of a sudden an article appears (coinciding  with deepening resentment and an under 20,000 attendance) saying they didn't have enough money?

Based on the character of our Glorious Chairman ... wouldn't Bates JUMP at the chance to laugh at the fans and gloat how people couldn't provide the funds? Several times in the past he's said we've received spurious bids without proof of funds - yet this time he keeps silent?

Just my thought though.

&gt; It is first stated in The Deadly Assassin (1976) that a Time Lord can regenerate twelve times before dying (thirteen incarnations in all).

However...

&gt; The BBC's Series 4 FAQ suggests that now the Time Lord social order has been destroyed, the Doctor may be able to circumvent the limit on regenerations; it says: ""Now that his people are gone, who knows? Time Lords used to have 13 lives."" In Death of the Doctor (a 2010 The Sarah Jane Adventures serial), the Eleventh Doctor responds to a question from Clyde Langer by saying he can regenerate ""507"" times.

So the only safe answer I can give you to the question if the Doctor is destined to ""die"" after Matt Smith is ""no.""

 You really can't expect a player of his ability and age to stay at the lane.

We aren't going to be competing at the top level (champs league) on a regular basis and until we get a stadium with a bigger capacity it won't be on a regular basis imo. He also has 4/5 years to earn as much money as possible to last him &amp; his family the rest of his life, though I like to think his motivation for leaving was mainly for footballing reasons.

true,elapid,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"Prime Minister, Tony Blair, was visiting a school when a teacher asked him if he would care to lead the class discussion on semantics. Tony, having just escaped a mauling by the BBC's Jeremy 'Rotweiler' Paxman by the skin of his lying teeth, smugly chose the word ‘tragedy' and asked the class to give an example of its use.

One boy stood up and said, “If my girlfriend, Suzie, who lives on a farm, was playing near the cesspit, and fell in, and her dad stuck a fork through her chest and killed her, that would be a tragedy.”
“No,” said Blair, “that would be an accident.”

Then a pretty, dark haired girl called Keli, raised her hand and suggested shyly: “If there was, like, a nucla war dat killed all da blokes but left da girls alive and da last bloke on earth lost his testicles in a shaving accident, that would be like, a REAL tragedy.”
“I’m afraid not.” Said slimey Tone. “That’s what we would call a great loss.”

The room went silent. No other children volunteered. Blair searched the room in vain for an upraised hand. “Isn’t there anyone here who can give me a correct definition of the word 'tragedy?”

Finally, a scruffily dressed blonde right at the very back of the room raised her grubby hand. In an an uncertain voice she said: “If an aircraft carrying you, Mr. Blair, the cabinet and Mr Bush was struck by a ‘friendly’ missile fired by an American helicopter gunship and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy.”
“Fantastic!” exclaimed Blair. “That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?”

“Well...” replied the girl, “it has to be a tragedy, because it certainly wouldn’t be a great loss and it probably wouldn’t be an accident either.”

If you look at someone like Xavi Hernandez, his head constantly on a swivel, looking around him, while he calculates his next couple of moves. He's always thinking 1 or 2 steps ahead of others, while someone like Henderson is very much a reactionary type player.

I thought Sahin played well, but the combination of him and Henderson as the 2 holding mids really left us exposed at the back. They're both great players, but neither of them is a holding mid.

By bringing Kolarov on for Nasri, he changed the formation from a 4-2-3-1 to something of a 4-3-2-1, with Garcia and Barry in their usual holding-mid roles, and Kolarov playing along their flank in the aforementioned anger/fullback position, but nobody on the other side to do the same, leaving maicon kind of alone, and allowing Ronaldo room to cut in, and receive passes from Marcelo, sense he couldn't cover both of them. We were able to hold this way in the first half though, because even though our midfield was asymmetrical, we still had 4 evenly spaced defenders, with Maicon was playing right fullback, and Kompany center right. But when Zabaleta came on and we transitioned to a 3-5-2, both he and Kompany were in positions they weren't comfortable with.

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"1 - I think we would have been better off adding another out and out midfielder (Ramires) instead of trying to hold steadfast to the 4-2-3-1. I'd have liked a 4-3-2-1, the extra dedicated midfielder would have been better against the 5 Juve players. Easy to shift that formation to a 4-3-3 if wanted too.

2 - I've seen it from Oscar a bit but to be honest, not too much from Hazard. Maybe I just didn't notice it. He's better than Mata, who's basically invisible defensively, but it didn't really stand out to me.

&gt; So the question I will pose to you guys is this: Are we really that weak defensively if we play the trio of Hazard, Mata, and Oscar together?

I think we are a bit, especially against strong attacking sides. I think having three ""strong"" players in midfield to combat them. The line-up we sent out against Barcelona in 2009 was one of the most perfect Chelsea lineups I've seen, Essien/Ballack/Lampard in midfield was extremely tough, hostile and aggressive. Taking one of the midfield players out and replacing him with an attacker weakens us and we're still trying to adjust to it. Is there another way to find balance? I think if we had more mobile, central midfielders who are strong in the tackle and physically big. Like if Mikel was partnered by Khedira, I think we wouldn't have a problem playing Hazard/Mata/Oscar. Lampard is decent defensively but we could do better, I think for a proper 4-2-3-1, we should find someone better. I think we need to go out and sign a new midfielder.

true,GappyHilmore,IT,italy,"To answer the question are we too weak defensively if we play Hazard, Oscar and Mata I would say yes. But only because Lampard is adapting to a deeper midfield role. IMO he still doesn't understand this role completely and leaves Mikel exposed due to a lack of discipline. 

If the line-up was Hazard, Oscar, Mata; Ramires, Mikel I still think we are too weak defensively, but stronger than a midfield 2 of Lamps and Mikel. 

SG said it best, if Robbie stays with the 4-2-3-1 then Chelsea need a proper player to accommodate Mikel in the double-pivot. Someone strong who can win the ball but also able to pick out a good forward pass. There used to be these two guys one was named Michael and the other was Raul but for some reason they are no longer with us. 

I love Ryan Bertrand but putting him in the LW/LAM position is not right when there are players that actually play that position. Moses and Sturridge deserve a bigger role in the offense. Let Bertrand stick to LB where hopefully he will take over for Ashley. 

I would like to see a 4-3-3 formation of Hazard, Torres, Mata; Oscar, Ramires, Mikel. Similar to the [line-up](http://this11.com/topics/add/abDo0kvanE) against Juve. Oscar and Hazard did well back tracking and nicking the ball from peoples feet. 

This essentially can switch to a 4-3-2-1 that SG mentioned with Hazard and Oscar behind Nando. The question is; will this bother Torres? Most likely. 

My strongest line-up offensively with the players provided would be [this](http://this11.com/topics/add/abDo0rnacu) Still a bit weak defensively but with the right tactics will allow for more controlled possession.

true,Colourious,tennant,Tennant,"Sure, not everyone is a Martha fan, but I wouldn't say that many Whovians HATE Martha. Personally I love her, but I also acknowledge that she has a different, more complicated role in Doctor Who than, say, Rose, so it's harder to like her and just chalk her up as ""annoying"".

Honestly I don't like comparisons between New Who Companions like ""stronger or smarter than"" because it's not really why they're there. RTD/Moffat put them there for different reasons and to develop them differently. Because it's Doctor Who, I'll gladly go in depth here.

**Rose** did develop a lot, I'll agree with you there. But (and I read this somewhere else so I won't take credit for this idea), Rose is very special to a lot of people because she changed from chav cheerleader in Season 1 to geeky savior of the universe by Season 4. The Ninth and Tenth Doctors, for better or for worse, made her more like them. Smart, resourceful, respectful of all life, even a bit militant if need be. Her life was changed because of the Doctor. But so was the Doctor's. The Ninth Doctor is a very temperamental, distressed man (or time lord or whatever). He needed a therapeutic Companion. Rose was a surprisingly good one. She was kind and inquisitive and naive; just the kind of emotional compass Nine needed. Another thing is the latent romantic (sexual is debatable) tension between the two, culminating in Ten(nant). Historically Companions and the Doctor never mixed like that, but Rose and the Doctor did, and it worked, according to most people. So Rose is much more likeable to many because it's sort of a fangirl (fanboy, fandom, what have you) relationship between the two. That's not bad, but it's an easy situation to love and gif-ify on tumblr over and over.

**Martha** and the Doctor are not a fandom. That's the whole thing about Martha: the Doctor doesn't see her as she sees him. [Okay, maybe that's not the *whole* thing, but stay with me] And that might be one reason we don't like Martha as much as Rose, because it's the relationship that doesn't work. Like capital-R Real Life, it fails (or never starts). Sure, they're great friends, and the Doctor ends up appreciating her a lot, he never has those feelings for her, likely because of Rose. Martha's real story is, like you said, that she goes on to be a part of UNIT and really gains confidence, intelligence, and independence after her time with the Doctor. She can call him in when she knows she needs him, and he trusts that she's right. But it's always a fact of her life that the Doctor just wasn't that into her. And she was smart enough to realise this and pull away, even when he wasn't. This is a harder storyline to like. I do like it, personally, but it hits different feels than the Rose-Doctor feels you get on Tumblr. So neither situation/Companion is better, it's just different.
A quick note on **Donna**, not because you asked but because you mentioned you hated her. Part of Donna's personality is that she's rude and annoying. If you watch the end of season four and the End of Time parts with her, you can see pre-Doctor Donna in all of her ugliness. The point of Donna is that the Doctor made her so much better by having her travel with him. Wilf says this outright. Donna's MO was to be blunt, defensive and stubborn, mostly because her mother's kind of a bitch who instilled an inferiority complex in her. Ten notes that she doesn't think she's important because everyone's always thought/said that about her all her life. But Ten proves that she can be resourceful and intelligent and compassionate about people, and that she doesn't always need to protect herself from perceived insult. She learns to be inquisitive about the world around her and to not be so selfish. So what if that meant all of Season 4 had to be about how Donna's the most important person in the universe? From a character-development perspective, it works and it worked well.

I won't get into attractiveness of the Companions, because that's not a very good reason to like one companion over the other. Personally I think all the New Who Companions have been very good looking.

**TL;DR Rose/Doctor and Martha/Doctor are not the same relationships (Martha/Doctor is more complex), so it seems some people don't like Martha. Donna's character development I would argue is well-done. Don't say one companion is better than the other, they all had their moments and were useful for different reasons.**

One of Moffat's greatest shortcomings is a focus more on great ""lines"" and ""moments"" rather than making the characters feel real and relateable. A lot is lost when you reduce River to being a flirty, winking gun-toter, the Doctor to a ""x's are cool"" spouting goof, and Amy as... well Amy. 

Out of all the cast Rory feels the most real. He's not perfect but he tries. He gets scared but he cares. He gets walked on and yet he keep moving forward.

He's not the brightest but he's not an idiot, he's not witty or snarky or sharp or anything spectacular, and that's what makes him so real.

He's not the eccentric genius that the Doctor is or the bossy woman-child Amy is. He's just a normal guy with a lot of heart and that's what makes Rory so endearing.

No natural resources?  The UK has oil, gas, coal, minerals and metal ore, 11 000 miles of coastline to be exploited for energy production, and fishing stocks.  It has one of the most efficient agricultural sectors and its climate lends to unique produce.  It recently struck more oil off the Falklands identifying the first financially viable field.  It also has off shore Antarctic claims.  The UK is resource wealthy!

Not much primary industry?  It is ninth in the world manufacturing league tables so there's obviously something going on somewhere, whereas it's 80th in terms of landmass.  Added to that it has high end manufacturing and has *the* world leading finance sector.  Its space and satellite technology is set to effectively take a corner of the market.

Inefficient services sector?  The service sector is the one that's been bumping all the trends.  The service sector is where all the real growth has been in the last 10yrs or so.

I'm not saying everything is rosy but the natural resources, it's primary industries, it's high end manufacturing are what the UK has going for it!

&gt;Upside: not in the Euro, so the pound can continue to weaken until the economy is competitive.

I don't know if you've spotted the GBP-Euro trend for the last year or so.  The more they talk about bailouts in Europe the more the pound looks like a haven.  Added to that China, Russia, Europe and the IMF are all slowly building momentum behind the IMF's Drawing Rights basket currencies, so expect the pound to start climbing on the USD in the future too.

The reason youth was fielded is because the manager has a very very poor squad and he is looking for a miracle young player to come through.

true,what__she__said,k9,K-9,"This ""Romana comes out with several different looks"" scene has ALWAYS bothered me. Why? Because it's so different from the way the Doctor regenerates (which usually takes quite a while and is dramatic/painful, and during which he has no choice of what he looks like) and because it seemed as if Romana was ""burning"" some of her 12 regenerations so quickly. (And does this pic show all of them? I thought there was a sort of porpoise thing in there too.)

For the record I was also massively annoyed by the mysterious white figure ([The Watcher](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Watcher)) who ""merged"" with Tom Baker's Doctor as he regenerated into Peter Davison's Doctor. Even though it would make things dull for the writers (and perhaps us viewers), the consistency-freak part of me would like a single regeneration process rather than continuous tweaking of the mechanisms.

Anyway, definition time.
Ambassador (in the non-political sense) ""a representative or promoter of a specified activity"" ([Source](http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ambassador?region=uk&amp;q=ambassador))

We've got our little community here on /r/Edinburgh. People come to Edinburgh and want to meet some of us, not specific people, just the community. Some of us organise things and show up, that makes us representatives of the larger whole.

I'm not trying to trumpet some sort of pretentious cause, I'm trying to encourage a bit of good spirit and banter. **I agreed with you about night outs not needing multiple immediate follow up threads**, however this one is an exception to that as it's more than just that.

&gt;If I go out with some people from across the world, I don't need to post about it here and show how much of a ""global ambassador"" I am.

Neither do I. I didn't post this, I wasn't there, but I'm at least open to the idea that other people might want to come from other places and have some people to have drinks with or do activities with. Having a friendly network ready to welcome them when they arrive, or help them settle in if they're moving here, well to me that seems like being a friendly human being.

If that makes me a bad person to some of you then that's a price I'll just have to pay.",0,1348193179,null,0,false,0,c6b7db7,t3_106piq,t1_c6b7db7,t1_c6b60gz,null,1429951582,1,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,1
