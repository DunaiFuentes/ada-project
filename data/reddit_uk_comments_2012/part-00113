It had excellent location shots and a decent story. A little weak in its portrayal of the villains, but the Rani's TARDIS was awesome. So I bought and watched the ""Trial of a Time Lord"" boxed set, and thoroughly enjoyed it. The special features on the DVDs helped me understand the time and situation that the Sixth Doctor worked in, and I had a greater appreciation for him as a result. I pretty much liked all of the episodes involved, and I thought the special effects were very good for classic Who. The Time Lords space station was really excellent.

The only other Sixth Doctor story I've seen was ""The Two Doctors"" which I thought was mediocre. I liked the Second Doctor and Jamie interacting with the Sixth Doctor and Peri. However, the aliens and special effects really were sub-par. The location setting in Spain was a somewhat redeeming factor.

I found the stories to be a LOT more interesting than many of the other Doctors, and the personality of the sixth Doctor is great!  So full of energy, fun, boisterous, threatening when he needs to be and a bit dark.

The sixth Doctor audio Big Finish productions are the best.  I highly recommend them.  

Collin Baker is a really amazing person and actor, super friendly and was unfairly screwed over by the producer when he was replaced with Sylvester McCoy.

I think the clownish costume really threw off the fans and became a distraction which was most likely my issue when I first saw him.  Even Collin Baker supposedly hated the costume.  However, if I had a choice of Doctor Who cosplay costumes to choose from the sixth Doctor's would be my choice.

subs:jones, kelly, coates, shelvey, sterling, allen and borini

while allen is a fantastic young player, i feel that he should be used regularly as a sub for gerrard when captain fantastic isn't so fantastic, filling in alongside lucas and leaving sahin as the lone attacking mid.. downing has been given chance after chance to prove his worth and he's failed which is extremely disappointing for an experienced international.. sterling meanwhile, has dazzled against every opponent he's faced, so maybe it's time to give him a chance... i feel that carroll should be given an opportunity to fulfill his potential... it's insanity to sacrifice an in-form striker and throw borini into the deep end straightaway... borini looks talented but has neither the pace nor the dribbling skills to play on the wing, however his finishing makes him an ideal backup for carroll.. lastly, luis suarez, liverpool's best player at the moment would be better used as a winger.. though he is no lennon or walcott he is still faster than most of liverpool's current attackers and has the ability to jink his way past anyone on his day... unfortunately as we saw against west brom, his finishing still needs work... on the wing he would be free to roam around creating space and to cut in, either to take a shot or to create a scoring opportunity for carroll or borini

That's hard to determine, of course, because I really like all of them -- but I think there were quite a lot of rather-decent-even-if-not-fantastic episodes with Martha featuring a large part. The initial one with the hospital on the moon was a fantastic introduction, showing that Martha is actually quite clever and, in more than one sense, nearing 'doctor'ship in her own right. After that, the one with Shakespeare was quite fun. Admittedly, after that, the one in a billion A.D. with the cat-people was a smidge underwhelming. Daleks in Manhattan was one of my less favorite double-eps. ""The Lazarus Experiment"" was slightly forgettable. But then they come back with ""42"", the one with the sun-dwelling entity.

So, one added day of rest for the squad over Newcastle and playing a tricky side at home. I fully expect the squad to deliver another win. With 3 wins out of 3 matches, we set a perfect benchmark at the top of the table for other teams to hit entering into the international break.

* The Empty Child (Are you my mummy?)

* The Girl in the Fireplace (Perhaps those clockwork robots would work nicely.)

* 42 (Shouldn't be too hard to get a hold of a welding mask. ""Burn with me"")

* Blink (You need the angels. Definitely the best ""jump scare"" the series has to offer)

* Silence in the Library (Get the kids paranoid about their shadows using clever lighting. Could work.)

* Midnight (This one is tricky, but again, could work. You'll need someone to be ""taken over"" by the creature.)

* The End of Time (just to review what the Ood are like. An Ood, or the Doctor himself would be your best bet for your tour guide.)

* Vincent and the Doctor (an invisible beast could be good for a tight budget)

* The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon (tricky, but could be done right. Get someone to suddenly reveal they have tally marks on their arm halfway through the tour)

* Night Terrors (the dolls could be a good one as a low budget scare)

* The God Complex (a door for everyone? Make your guide look into a door only to be completely terrified by it's contents (if you can, avoid showing the group what's actually inside). Explain that there is a door for everyone in the group. Just keep them waiting.)

* Closing Time (Good example of Cybermen. Have the group interrupt a group of Cybermen trying to convert someone.)

true,dangercart,lfc68,,"Oh god, please no!  That's exactly what I am happy we are getting away from.  I don't see how Carroll fits with two wingers who want to come inside a shoot.  That's what is looks like Assaidi wants to do from the little I've seen of him.  We'd also have two midfielders who both want to play longer passes with a manager who wants to play a possession game.    Our only outlet would be long diagonals to the wings where they attack the corners of the penalty area (basically the way we attacked through Sterling against Hearts before Allen came on) of long straight balls for Carroll to try to flick onto Suarez cutting in from the right.  That's what we saw some of last season and it didn't work.

Borini has always scored goals and does it best coming in from the left.  We didn't buy him to have him sit behind a relative unknown like Assaidi.  Allen has looked really good in the time he has played for us.  We got noticeably better when he was on the field against Hearts and Rodgers clearly thinks he is a key player for making his system work.  Part of playing  possession heavy game is trying to wear out your opponents so only bringing on a player like Allen for the last 30 minutes of a game doesn't have the same impact as letting him start and try to grab control of the game right from the beginning.

I don't get the desire to fit in Carroll that so many people on the subreddit have.  He isn't ""in form""; he scored one goal at the Euros and had a handful of good games at the end of last season.  Borini scored more goals in less minutes last season and brings more to the team in other areas.  Suarez has struggled with his finishing for us but is great for Uruguay and has more of a track record as a quality finisher than Carroll does.  Andy has played 80 Premier League games in his career and has 21 goals.  Last season he played 35 times in the league and scored four times.  He's had his opportunity; we have other players who have performed better and deserve to play before him.

Sterling may have dazzled but he's played a total of like 200 minutes for us.  Like everyone, I am excited to see how he develops but we can't count on him to make regular contributions in the league just yet.",0,1345873895,null,0,false,0,c5yglnm,t3_yrdap,t1_c5yglnm,t1_c5yehd8,null,1429730642,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Such use was given Parliamentary approval in 1908 when it was stated that ""the Union Jack should be regarded as the National flag"".""

Here's a tip: perhaps you should try asking the BBC like Brian Whitaker did. But you won't do that because assuming malafide intent on the BBC's part fits with your preconceived notions. Like when you assumed that the BBC removed the video for nefarious propaganda purposes, even though they broadcast it on TV for an entire newscycle.

No, it's not; what did you think of *The Stand*'s ending? Personally I thought it was cheesy. A deus ex machina. The similar novel *Swan Song* (by Robert McCammon) did much the same thing. Great book (both of them are). So easy to get lost in the post-apocalyptic/superflu world and the characters, and all the buildup -- then this big thing happens from left field and wins for one side or the other.

But if there's one thing King's endings has taught me, it's not to rush towards the end, because everything but the beginning and end is the best part -- so I take my time with it. Kind of a change of pace having gone from reading all seven *Dark Tower* books at once, then *11/22/63*, to reading the late Stieg Larsson's *Millennium* trilogy (e.g. *The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo*). Those books are history lesson for the first 3/4 (as an American, Swedish history/politics are largely lost on me, but I do try) and action for the last part. (If you've only seen David Fincher's remake of the first one's movie, you're missing out.

*The Gunslinger*: Short, very short. Boring at times, and a flashback is disorienting. Not that good but it whets your appetite. Open-ended.

*The Drawing of the Three*: Cool as hell. The best of the first three. Doesn't really end (its proper ending is in the beginning of the next book).

*The Waste Lands*: Not as good as *Drawing*, but contains its end. A couple cool stories here, continues the quality of the last book but doesn't build on it much. Also ends in the beginning of the next book.

*Wizard and Glass*: IMO, the best book. Starts with the end of *Waste Lands*, and ends with the beginning of *Wolves*. The bulk of this book is a giant flashback, and it's solid gold.

*Wolves of the Calla*: The group has been on a journey thus far, but now they stop to help a group of people. There's a mystery here, and it starts to build the ending. Not bad, feels like it could be better.

*Song of Susannah* and *The Dark Tower*. Honestly I can't tell you what's in one and what's in the other. *Song* wraps up the story in *Wolves*, and from there, the series races toward its conclusion.

Like any King book, the best parts of the series are books 2 and 4 with parts of 3 and 5. 1 is okay, 6 is okay, and 7 is okay but the ending... well, you're either going to love it or you're going to hate it.

My sentiments exactly, but I am going to try anyway. I don't need to assume malafide intent because of how they do journalism over at the BBC. Most stories are without author attribution, and when they make edits to existing articles (or when they are pulled from the public record completely) again it happens anonymously and without explanation. Changes are not documented, especially when their complicity or incompetence has them publish articles with misleading Houla pictures. The fact that we have to find the explanation from Whitaker in the comments of the Guardian is damning in itself.

Whether it is up on the NYT is irrelevant. You are correct in that I could ask the BBC but they could fob me off with any explanation. The second thing to say is that if someone hadn't have been watching before the redaction we would never have known it happened.

Now, consider that the BBC reported on Hague giving these people (roughly speaking) 5m£ last week, isn't it in the public interest to do a thorough story on them now there is documented evidence of war crimes? The historic record lies empty. Meanwhile any anonymously sourced story from syrian 'activist' gets a pass. It at least *looks bad*, and I think you are quite naive.

It does surprise me, actually: why start Byram against two of the best wingers who've played in the Championship this season (Jarvis and Ince; the former has already left and the latter might before the season is over), then only play your first-choice pairing (Peltier and Drury) in their natural positions after the two hardest games of the month are over?

Here's how we'll be playing, for the record:

--------------Kenny

Peltier---Lees---Pearce---Drury

Diouf---Norris---Austin---Varney

------------McCormack

-------------Becchio

Great to see Diouf starting, although I am a tad worried that there's been no movement on the contract front with him. I suspect that White is on the bench so that he can come on for Varney, if he has another lousy game, although he might just take McCormack off and move Diouf to the middle again. We'll see.

Can you imagine the audacity it would take to apply for funding with such a poor standing if they weren't delusional?  Nobody sane would even attempt it.  We're not talking about a well person here.    You should think about removing the link.

People should be contacting the art councils set up by the national lottery that allot funding.  They can be found here:

http://www.lottery.co.uk/info/grants.asp#arts

People need to contact their own MPs to inform them of the story, to raise the matter of such waste at a time of supposed austerity, and to leave no doubt that the government should review Camelot's ability to run the lottery and the entire lottery grants process.

The specific Scottish outfit that awards Lottery art funding is called CreativeScotland and can be found at:

Until the former head of BBC takes the full reigns at NYT then the BBC probably has little say in what happens on the other side of the pond. If they did an entire news cycle on it then you might have thought it should be important enough to jot the event down somewhere.

&gt; God forbid the BBC offers you an explanation that would contradict your preconceived notions.

Actions speak louder than words. This incident is another reason to distrust the organisation. I cited many others, and I could cite many more.

&gt; So then why do you want them to do a ""thorough story"" on the FSA.

I haven't asserted that I want the BBC to do a story, but that the BBC if it wasn't firstly a tool of public opinion management would have pursued that story as far as it could because it obviously is in the public interest.

It must be nice to be so convinced you are in the right. I won't claim to be certain of this but I do believe that Scotland is in fact a net contributor to the union. Perhaps by anchor you meant that Scotland provides some nice stability? Though based on the odious tone of the rest of your post it seems like you think Scotland is somehow holding back the rest of the United Kingdom (i.e. England in your narrow-minded world) from true greatness. 

Being a lowly Scotsman I can only hope our Tory masters are as magnanimous as you and do 'let us go' if we WIN the referendum - like it would somehow be their choice then. I think you'll find that as regards assests we won't be given anything from 'you' like children, rather we would be taking our fair percentage as equals. Though I’m sure Scotland would be happy to be rid of at least one ‘asset’ in the form of its nuclear arsenal.

true,bluefold,null,null,"Ultimately it comes down to British TV having MUCH shorter series runs than American TV. By the time you are halfway through half of the second series of the American Office you have already passed the episode count of The Office. 

British TV is very much about exploring character, they tend to be full of dialogue and character development because they know they only have a very short time in which to explore these characters. More often than not, especially with the BBC, if a show does not perform brilliantly it will not get a second series. So we have adapted our shows to burn brightly for a short time rather than have much longer seasons and tread water somewhat (I love both versions of the Office I should add)

Whereas American TV much prefers to explore situation, What would happen if Character X went to Place Y - Would it be interesting? This has multiple benefits as the character always ends up back in the same place they started (With minor changes) so the opportunities are pretty much endless. It also has the added benefit of being able to replace a character that is not quite working out or if the actor wants to move on. But with a constantly changing character like you find in British TV you have to rely on evoking base emotions to hook the audience as the time you spend with them will be brief. 

A brilliant example of this would be in crime dramas. Say Luther Vs. Law and Order. Luther works with a team (Albeit reluctantly and often behind their back) but they are never really foreground characters. We follow Idris Elba's journey and as such our lens on the story is very much through his eyes. However with Law and Order you don't get that as the cast is interchangeable. It is about the case and how it is prosecuted. We see it through the eyes of the characters but it is the characters as police officers. You could not replace Luther with another actor but you can take Kathryn Erbe out of Criminal Intent while she has a baby. 

tl;dr British TV has much shorter runs and less chance of staying on air for a long period of time so we explore character and humanity by appealing to base emotions. American TV explores situations and character development is very much secondary so it is much harder for you to develop with them. 

Also it is much more fun to torture your characters to see them happy. No one wants to see Sherlock and Watson solve banking fraud in the comfort of their living room while eating digestives and having a cup of tea... who I am kidding I would so watch that.",0,1345909877,null,0,false,0,c5yl1fx,t3_ystzz,t1_c5yl1fx,t3_ystzz,null,1429732723,11,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,11

For each goal scored by a goalkeeper or defender	6
For each goal scored by a midfielder	5
For each goal scored by a forward	4
For each goal assist	3

For every 2 goals conceded by a goalkeeper or defender	-1

For each own goal	-2
Clean sheets

A clean sheet is awarded for not conceding a goal whilst on the pitch and playing at least 60 minutes.

If a player has been substituted when a goal is conceded this will not effect any clean sheet bonus.

Red Cards

If a player receives a red card, they will continue to be penalised for goals conceded by their team.

Red card deductions include any points deducted for yellow cards

Assists

Assists are awarded to the player from the goal scoring team, who makes the last touch before the goal is scored.

If after this touch, an opposing player touches the ball outside the penalty area altering the intended destination of the ball, then no assist is given, except if this intervention directly results in an own goal.

In the event of a penalty or free-kick, the player earning the penalty or free-kick gets an assist if a goal is directly scored, but not if he takes it himself, in which case no assist is given.

All assists are reviewed daily but remain provisional until verified by the Press Association. For the avoidance of doubt, points awarded in-game are subject to change until the Gameweek closes. Once a Gameweek closes, no further adjustments to points will be made.

Bonus Points

The three best performing players in each match according to the EA SPORTS Player Performance Index will receive additional bonus points. 3 points will be awarded to the highest scoring player, 2 to the second best and 1 to the third.

Bonus points will be awarded on the Monday morning after the weekend matches are played. Any matches played on a weekday night will be awarded on the following morning.

Examples of how bonus point ties will be resolved are as follows:

If there is a tie for first place, Players 1 &amp; 2 will receive 3 points each and Player 3 will receive 1 point.
If there is a tie for second place, Player 1 will receive 3 points and Players 2 and 3 will receive 2 points each.
If there is a tie for third place, Player 1 will receive 3 points, Player 2 will receive 2 points and Players 3 &amp; 4 will receive 1 point each.",0,1345911073,null,0,false,0,c5yla44,t3_wxo2g,t1_c5yla44,t1_c5yl96y,null,1429732855,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

We should be ashamed of ourselves.  I guarantee you AVB wasn't told it would be this way.  His reputation is on the line, and we're sending him out with the only top-6 squad in the Premiership that is *weaker* than it was last season.  Everyone knew what they had to do but us.

I honestly don't see any real guarantee we'll strengthen significantly before the end of the window, either.  We're in for expensive targets whose clubs know we're desperate; Levy will expect movement on their asking prices, and he isn't going to get it.  Who's to say he doesn't walk away from any deal he thinks is still a couple of million too expensive, no matter how much the future of the club depends on us putting a good squad together?  There's always *next* window to buy all these world-class targets he's never quite willing to pay for.  Always *next* window.

Frankly, at this point it doesn't matter how this window ends.

Oh, for sure, we'll spend all summer *pretending* to pursue the ones you want, and in the end you'll settle for whatever cut-price attacking mid we give you, because you'll be so desperate for creativity.  And I hope you like Defoe as your second-choice striker - even though I know for a *fact* you don't - because the two striker targets we're fixated on to the exclusion of all others for no good reason are still pretty expensive, so when those deals fall through again there won't be a lot of time to shop for anyone else.  Oh, and take a good look at the likes of Bentley and Dos Santos - you might need them when I don't get you any wing cover, because I'm too busy shopping for strikers and CMs that I *also* won't get you.

You only need to listen to talk radio (I know, I know) to hear indignation daily. And it is not necessarily the direction the media seeks to channel it. There is a resentment of the current system and of all the mainstream political parties. It doesn't take much longer than five minutes with many people to get to this point. 

As for the unions? I read a Stratfor report that claimed of three necessary pillars in a given established society, these are one. While they used to be very important for the labour movement, now their leadership is generally made up of high paid opportunists
 who make more concessions than they earn. Anecdotally again, union members I have talked to don't think much of their leadership least of all that they are properly represented. There is the token threat of a strike now and again but usually for short term goals. The unions do not have any teeth. The rank and file does, the union is a safer channel.

People can downvote all they want but today he completed 87% of his passes, made 3 tackles, 5 interceptions, and created two chances. Only Bale created more. This isn't /r/soccer by the way. If you disagree with my assessment of the player, provide some substantive refute--don't just downvote me like one of the mongoloids on that subreddit. 

I wouldn't be starting him if we had a real creator, but that doesn't mean Jake as a player was shit. It means we're playing with what we can because we frankly don't have any better options.

Now I'm not saying this should happen so from a policy point of view if we or the government decide that it's more desirable to  allow everyone to buy rather than rent then the thing they need to do is remove the investment incentive. 

An investor can buy a house that an average family can't and rent it back to them at a lower price than the mortgage would cost. So the family can afford the house, just that the investor gets better terms because of the tax deductability of the payments. 

So demand won't reduce until the investment incentive goes, if it does then prices will gravitate back toward what families on average earnings can afford otherwise they'll gravitate towards what average investors can afford.

true,sparty09,null,null,"That's a good point, but a lot of our better shows in the U.S. have relatively short seasons. Shows which air on HBO, AMC, Showtime, and other cable networks are maybe 8-12 episodes, while shows airing on the networks are 20+. I didn't know about the production time, but I've haven't understood why some of the better British shows seemingly can't be longer than 3 episodes.

EDIT: One of the things I thought about is that NCIS is one of the most popular shows on TV and draws ~20m viewers per episode for 24 episodes and has been doing it for the past 3 years (and it drew nearly as much before that). It's been on for 9 seasons, so there have been hundreds of episodes. All the same, as one of the most popular shows on TV, it probably brings in loads of money for CBS and isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Mad Men, on the other hand, is the most popular show on AMC and drew 3.5m viewers per episode over 13 episodes this past season (and that was a massive ratings improvement over last season). Even though it has won a number of awards and is quite popular, it's nowhere near the level of NCIS (or CSI or Law and Order in terms of weekly viewership).

I think the point I'm making is that the popular shows on the networks have long runs and long seasons because they bring in huge amounts of viewers. It seems to me that most of our better and more critically-acclaimed shows are on basic cable and the premium channels (one other thing is that the FCC has control over what type of material the networks are allowed to air. It can be decently violent and have foul language, but nothing really crazy. Shows on basic cable are a bit more free and shows on premium channels can go completely wild if they'd like). I don't know. I don't know how this really relates to British TV, but it might explain why shows are more likely to burn brightly and have short runs than they are on American TV.",0,1345919024,null,0,1345922394,0,c5ymx60,t3_ystzz,t1_c5ymx60,t1_c5ym9pl,null,1429733746,2,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,2

Arsenal are the only question mark I can see - the only team where I don't know for a fact that they're stronger than they were last season.  I'm still not positive, though.  There's time for Giroud and Podolski to come good, and Cazorla is really a world-class signing masquerading as a typical Wenger signing - he'd be a mainstay on any national team but Spain and could have every bit the impact of Silva and Mata.

&gt; I do think that we will sign a playmaker, ideally Moutinho

I still think Moutinho is very far-fetched.  I agree that AVB's words shouldn't necessarily be taken as gospel, but Porto are notorious for refusing to budge on their asking prices and Levy is notorious for not paying asking prices.  Someone will come in to replace Modric, I'm just not convinced it will be someone world-class.

&gt; I'm afraid if we fail to sign 2 really world class players, we will finish anonymously, perhaps 7th place.

I think we really need 3.  Another top center-forward, a Modric replacement, and someone like Willian to play on the wings.  Otherwise I honestly don't think 7th is a terrible estimate.

true,SpottieOttieDopalis,lfc68,,"Pretty much. Two years ago the red sox gave Carl Crawford a 7 year 140 million dollar contract, which for an outfielder that has never hit 20 hr's in a season is a big no-no, because speed is usually the first thing to go as a player gets older. Add that to the fact that he's been injured and underperformed for the majority of the two years, and you get one of the worst contracts in baseball for the past 5-10 years.

That same off-season the Red Sox traded for Adrian Gonzalez and gave him a 7 year 154 million dollar contract. When this happened everyone was extremely happy to get a great offensive and defensive 1st baseman entering his prime. The only problem is that this year he has significantly underperformed in regards to his HR power. He usually averages about 30-40 a year, but this year he only has 15 with 40 games to go. He's not underperformed to Crawford's extent, but he's not completely justified his 21 million a year salary. He's still consider a top 10 1st baseman and the only reason he was included was to get the Dodger to take the other two salaries.

You then have Josh Beckett, who is a pitcher that signed a 4 year 68 million dollar contract extension 2 years ago as well. He was instrumental in the Red Sox winning the world series in 07, dominating opposition in the playoffs. He recently has come under fire for playing golf on his day off when was injured, and being unapologetic about it and harsh towards the media. Last year he was involved in a chicken and beer fiasco. It involved a couple pitchers drinking beer and eating fried chicken in the locker room when it wasn't their turn to pitch that day. On top of all this he has been horrendous this year with a 5-11 record and a 5.23 ERA.

Basically it's a win win for both teams. The Red Sox rid themselves of 260 million dollars for some prospects and the Dodgers get a major boost for their playoff run this year. The Red Sox really need to get back to their formula of youth players with some expensive, but reasonable players. In recent years they've been more like the Yankees(or Real Madrid, Chelsea, Man City, ect..) buying the marquee free agent and bloated their team salary with over-payed and old players.

TL;DR: LA gets help for their playoff run, while the Red Sox shed $260 million in salary.",0,1345924445,null,0,1345933208,0,c5yo3o6,t3_ysruz,t1_c5yo3o6,t1_c5ymmj8,null,1429734327,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

Finally; we don't attack through the middle anymore. So stop worrying about the lack of a midfield playmaker. We held the ball well until the end (when we had DOWN SYNDROME and Livermore in the middle of the pitch)  and still created a good few chances. Defoe has no vision, or we'd have won 4-1.

So take a deep breath; we were missing Kaboul, who is one of the few players in the Prem who can match up with Lukaku. We're missing Scotty, whose grit and calm in midfield was needed. But we DONT need to panic buy right now, we don't need more scoring threat.

BAE will always be a liability in my eyes, whenever I see a Cruyff turn/stepover I always get a little scared. His style is just so risky for a left back. I wish he'd just put a boot through the ball more often.

Livermore played fine today and his game can only go up, he does spread the play out quite a bit. But I feel he lacks vision for a real killer pass. As for home games against teams out of the top tier, I do hope that we do start both Rafa and Sigurdsson. This article is worth a read imo  http://www.spursfanatic.com/player-analysis/rafael-van-der-vaart-gylfi-sigurdsson-exist-midfield/

I'm a big fan of Townsend and I'd like to see him used in the league at some point. Presumably we'll start the next match with a Ade as a lone striker, if we're chasing 3 points we all know Defoe is a good impact sub, and I have confidence Townsend will be if given the chance.

The next league game is Norwich at home, and I do hope we can see a line-up along the lines of : Friedel; BAE, Kaboul, Vertonghen, Walker; Sandro, Sigurdsson; Lennon, VDV, Bale; Adebayor

Yes Reddit is not at tabloid, it's a link aggregation site with a community that has a penchant for intelligent conversation, unlike the majority of most news sources.

In that vein i'm interested to know what value you perceive you have provided by changing a headline in such a way that it introduced an inaccuracy while influenced the initial tone and course of the discussion towards vacantly insulting the subject of the story.

Rather than something along  the lines of ""Parade commision ruling ignore by parade"" which provides information to those browsing the sub you decided on derision, what value did that add or the original bbc headline or something like I suggested above?

* Two clean sheets out of three closely-packed games into the season is really good. However, making it out to be the reason for a PL title is akin to hailing Swansea as the best team in the PL because they have a +8 GD after games against QPR and West Ham. Too early. Hold yer horses.

* Torres must shoot more often. 

    Yeah, yeah, he scored, executed a good rabona and all that, fine. He also muffed up two ops looking for support and two others looking for contact fouls. You're leading the line, bro. Act like it. Take your fucking chances, especially when you have beaten the last defender.

    ^(I'll keep goading until he takes at least 8 shots per game on an average. Then I'll start criticizing on how he needs to find the net more often. What? You guys will get there soon enough. I'm just starting a little early. :P)

* Cech as a captain-goalkeeper today oozed more confidence than Cech as a goalkeeper under Terry.

* Isn't Mata the FK specialist? Why were Luiz and Meireles even in the picture? Also, Hazard's supposed to be decent at FKs, right?

* Mikel is THE most improved player in these 3 games. As someone pointed out on my twitter timeline, he used to have the turning radius of a tank, but his turns on the ball today were simply astounding. He seems to be working on his attacking game (forward movement, through passes, etc.) as well. 

    ^(Yeah, I don't believe I am actually saying this, either!)

* Meireles offered something today that Lamps didn't: stability &amp; connectivity in the middle of the pitch. He was available as an immediate outlet to Mikel most of the time, thereby easing the pressure on him quite a lot. Moreover, he'd quickly distribute the ball sideways/forward to either Mata or Hazard thus helping us initiate quick counter-attacks. Lamps, OTOH, usually gets caught higher up the pitch and Mikel has to hold on until someone drops deep to pick up the ball from him.

* Ramires in NOT a right winger. He is a right-sided wide-midfielder at best. Likewise, Bertrand is a good, defensive, left-sided wide-midfielder, at best. Putting him on as winger probably helped stem Ben Arfa's threat, although there were a few drool-worthy dribbles from the cheeky Frenchman.

* Cahill and Luiz seemed to have a good thing going throughout the match. Touch wood.

* If we're going to get our foot off the gas pedal, let's score at least three goals before we do it? Please? My heart has been in my mouth so many times now, I could probably recreate the taste in a kitchen!

true,cheerioincident,tardis,TARDIS,"Hey, thanks for insinuating that people who don't like Martha are racist!

Here's why I don't like Martha (it's not because I'm racist):

I never believed her as a character.  Rose had a dead-end job, was in a dead-end relationship, had pretty much no prospects.  The only thing she had going for her was her mother, Jackie, but Rose was about the age that most people move out and start their own lives anyway.  She was bored with her life, and could see it was going nowhere.  Then, suddenly, a mysterious, cool, funny, magical man comes along with a fuckin' time machine and tells her to come along.  Of course she would!  Who wouldn't want to leave a dead-end life and go travelling through time and space (especially with someone who pushes all the daddy-issue buttons?  Sorry, had to say it)?

Donna had no job (right?), no relationship, and her mom sucked.  All she had was her Grandpa.  In the time between her wedding and becoming a full on companion, she started to become more adventurous - remember, she started investigating Adipose on her own.  I don't think it's fair to lump her in with the helpless companion trope.  So, yeah, when the Doctor showed up again, of course she wanted to go with him.

Amy always wanted more excitement than life in that little village could give her.  Not to mention she'd spent so much of her life thinking about the Doctor, that again, it was the obvious thing for her to become a companion.  The only thing she had keeping her where she was was Rory, whom she was having some doubts about up until *Amy's Choice*.  She was afraid that he was too boring for her, that she'd be stuck in her little village forever, etc.  I don't think she really was willing to throw away her life with Rory for one night with the Doctor, I think she was just feeling impulsive and saw it as a way to escape for a minute.  And then, of course, he became a fellow companion, so there really was nothing for her at home.

Martha was a brilliant medical student with a bright future ahead of her.  She had a slightly broken, yet still loving family (although, if I remember correctly, her mom was kind of harsh).  And then this guy comes along, is totally crazy, kisses her once, and she's head over heals in love with him and willing to postpone/interrupt her life to go travelling with him?  That's why she never clicked with me.  I never really believed that she would abandon her life to travel with the Doctor.  I also think the whole unrequited love thing was overdone with her.  It got so old so fast.  Why would a woman as brilliant and stunning as Martha waste her time lusting after a man who was clearly unattainable?  It felt like the writers wanted us to sympathize with her from the beginning, but didn't give her a chance to win us over.  I think most of us were still reeling from the events of Doomsday, and we weren't ready to like another companion yet.

Speaking of the writing, I just didn't care for a lot of season three.  Blink was great, I liked the Family of Blood two-parter and Utopia, but the rest was just not very good.  And since this was Martha's only season, she gets unfairly lumped in with the badness of it.  

This might be a good time to point out that I liked Martha when she appeared on Torchwood, and I loved Freema in Law and Order: UK.

Your opinion could just as easily have been posted in a comment without the need to lower the tone of any possible discussion by immediately resorting to throwing an insult.

In my opinion that isn't a very productive way of starting a conversation.
I tend to avoid getting into my general views of politics in Northern Ireland as they are quite cynical and defeatist, however I do like to take parts in discussions about our system of goverment, your title alienated me and presumably any others with similar views as mine from directly contributing to the discussion. That is the reason i voiced an objection to the title, not because I disapprove of the submission, it's a very relevant article.

In summary I don't see how you throwing an insult, framing the discussion to be a circlejerk of ""segments of NI's society are dicks, right guys?"" and introducing an error was anything but a negative thing to do, as this kind of thing hurts the quality of future discourse.

Edit: This situation actually has a lot of parallels to many problems our political system and media has. Any time an issue comes up, regardless of how little it has to do with the sectarian divide in NI it is always framed in such a way that one side of the divide is to blame for the issue. My effort to encourage proper discourse is a reflection of my disgust at our societies inability to have a discussion without it devolving into tribalism.

With us, AVB has the backing of the chairman and the players. He's changed the way he does things and he's learned from his mistakes and missteps at Chelsea. This is a long term deal he's fallen into here and I believe (and sincerely hope) we give him more than one year. This time next year, after the closing of three transfer windows, I think we'll see a much younger, quicker, confident, and clinical squad. I can see the future being very bright.

Honestly, I think a lot of people fall in love with the Doctor quickly, especially Ten. He is a character that is so admirable, so amazing, so full of life - I think it is a strong person that doesn't love him in any way. You can see it in a lot of characters that dislike him at first, many of them slowly come around to admiring him - either for his bravery, or his love of life.

However, the writers used Martha's love for the Doctor as a way of defining her as Not-Rose. And that to me was appalling. Martha had so many other qualities that get barely any attention in the rush to point out at many points that Martha is Not-Rose.

&gt;I think most of us were still reeling from the events of Doomsday

I don't accept that as a reason. It's like refusing to watch the Eleventh Doctor because your favourite was the Tenth. Doctor Who is about change, either go with it or be left behind. Yes, Rose's departure was hugely emotional, but hanging onto that does a disservice to others.

&gt;Speaking of the writing, I just didn't care for a lot of season three.

Oh definitely not, series 3 had some really dodgy episodes in. This is why I mostly like talking about Martha rather than watching it too much.

Her family was a mess, the divorce and the dad dating again threw things in term oil. Martha never read like a forever companion to me either but it doesn't mean that with her family issues and med school and just life in general, that she wouldn't want a break. Traveling with the doctor allowed her to see how good she had it back home and I am sure the situation with the master drew her family together and even made her folks get back together. 

The fans need of a time out from Rose, really isn't an excuse not to like Martha just because she dared to fall for 10. It makes no sense, to dislike her because she was dropped into an other worldly situation and became attracted to the smart guy that fixed things. I mean it's the plot of Speed, and many other movies about dire situations creating a love match. Although in this case 10 was too heart broken to fall for what was in his lap.

Martha took an extreme vacation with the Doctor, did a really hard look at her life and decided she didn't need the Doctor the way the other did, and she moved on to find Micky.

Any adult who refuses to or is incapable of understanding logical processes which allow them to determine that sectarianism is a bad thing *should* be humiliated for the fucking morons that they are. Just because someone was born into a household of assholes doesn't give them freedom, or legitimacy to continue being an asshole. If they can't use their brains, they're fair game. 

If you want to defend hateful sectarian twats using a muddled interpretation of moral relativism, don't expect any support from anyone with a brain.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"Phil Dowd you utter chunt, at least that yellow card got Nando angry. It seems a common theme he plays better when he's pissed off, I think most strikers do

Meireles is like our midfield Berbatov, what he lacks in effort he makes up for by making the game look ridiculously simple at times. He helped up the tempo compared to Lampards effort against Reading, fair play to him he did better than expected

Storming game for Mikel, I wish his attempted through ball had reached Torres, that would have been the icing on the cake. Intercepted well, pressed hard and kept forcing the issue. I was at the game of course, you may not have seen much of his movement when the action was in other areas of the pitch but he kept track of all his men and bossed the role today

I think we are still a distance away from a full firing Torres, he was afraid to shoot too often and we'd expect him to be pulling the trigger not slowing play down and spreading the play in similar situations in a few weeks. Took his goal well, great movement

David Luiz cannot lead the line. If those two are the partnership it will be Cahill's responsibility to be the senior man and organise the back four. Goes wandering more often than I'd like and could have cost us by losing the ball in dangerous areas too often. He got away with it today, a better team would have punished him. He always wants to play out of trouble instead of clearing it, not always the best decision

Similarly to Torres, I don't think Mata shoots as often as he should. It's still early in the season and we've seen keepers make several mistakes already, in the rain with a sloppy ball we should have been peppering Krul from all angles instead of trying to play the killer ball from the edge of the box. We all know he can shoot, he has hardly tried in his first 3 games though

true,DiscoMonkay,,Derry,"&gt;Oscar immediately began 80 days of intense chemotherapy as part of a clinical trial. This treatment was extremely tough and he was very ill at times. It had great success in that it cleared most of the neuroblastoma, but Oscar needed to be taken off this trial in order to receive further specialist treatment in London. This meant that he was no longer eligible to receive a vital part of the clinical trial treatment, immunotherapy.  

Not eligible in the UK apparently.

&gt;The immunotherapy treatment is needed to help stimulate Oscar’s immune system, so that Oscar's own body should be able to recognise and attack the neuroblastoma ***if it was to return***. This is always a worry with this deadly disease, where the relapse rates are high.

Now I'm getting that the neuroblastoma has been dealth with, for now, and the money is needed to make sure it doesn't relapse.

&gt;I think most of us were still reeling from the events of Doomsday

I guess by that, I just mean that Martha was a victim of bad timing.  I think if Donna and Martha had been switched in the chronology, I would have liked Martha more.  The way it played out to me was that the writers gave us this hugely emotional, tragic ending with Rose (I was sad for days after Doomsday), and then didn't know quite how they were going to make us love a new companion, so they just tried *really really* hard to make a character we would like right away.  I think it would have been more effective to allow Martha to win us over, rather than make her super likable from the start.  It just felt like too much to me.  It's not that they introduced a new companion, because you're right - Doctor Who is about change.  It's just the way she was introduced.  I really think that Martha could have been a great character if she came at a later time in the show, if season three had just been better overall or if she'd had more time, and if she hadn't been force-fed to the audience when we were still licking our Rose wounds.

As for characters falling in love with the Doctor easily, yeah, I'll give you that.  Characters pining after him for entire seasons after it's painfully clear that it's not going to happen?  Not as much.  And it's stupid that they would expect a woman with as much going for her as Martha would just become that pathetic over anyone, even someone as marvelous as the Doctor.
&gt;However, the writers used Martha's love for the Doctor as a way of defining her as Not-Rose

I don't understand how being in love with the Doctor marked Martha as not-Rose, but...

&gt;...that to me was appalling. Martha had so many other qualities that get barely any attention in the rush to point out at many points that Martha is Not-Rose.

Agreed.  Martha was so much in Rose's shadow, both on the show and how she was written.

EDIT:  Because, you know, I clearly haven't said enough...

&gt;It's like refusing to watch the Eleventh Doctor because your favourite was the Tenth.

I disagree.  We all know the Doctor is going to change and we all know that it will more than likely be sad, so there's a bit more preparation there.  But, as Martha's departure proved, the companion's departure doesn't have to be as gut-wrenching as Doomsday was.  Also, by the time 10 gave way to 11, we had all been through a doctor shift, so again, we were prepared for it.  Those of us who picked up with New Who hadn't been through a companion shift when Rose left, and it was so sudden that we were (okay, I was) caught off guard by it.  This may be splitting hairs, but I just don't feel that the shift from 10 to 11 is directly parallel to the shift between Martha and Rose.",0,1345933786,null,0,1345934655,0,c5yq4q9,t3_ytbdb,t1_c5yq4q9,t1_c5yp0ha,null,1429735244,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

I actually thought her introduction wasn't *too* bad, her actions at the hospital proved her capability. There's not really any other way of introducing a new character - that is to say, there ""had"" to be another Companion. However, how did you watch series 2 and 3? When they were originally aired, or later when you could move on straight away? Because I don't think that helped some people, not having that forced break between series.

But I still think you're right about her introduction, in that if the Doctor had acted like more of a friend to her at the start, it would have helped some people accept Martha. Because I sometimes feel that people take the Doctor's lead and bemoan that ""Rose would know what to do"", again thereby defining Martha as Not-Rose.

If the Doctor had been less emo to Martha's face, it might have helped.

&gt;I don't understand how being in love with the Doctor marked Martha as not-Rose

Basically in that the Doctor did not reciprocate any of Martha's feelings. A lot of fans complain that they don't like Martha because she is in love with the Doctor and that was Rose and the Doctor was in love with Rose.

It was quite an important part of Rose's character, and by making it the largest aspect of Martha's character, it basically says: ""this woman loves the Doctor like Rose, but because she's not Rose so the Doctor doesn't love her"".

To be fair, the Doctor did not help her with this one bit.

She honestly thought she was second-best, and that is not a healthy basis for a friendship - even friendship with the Doctor.

Hahah, but Rose did it by absorbing the Time Vortex. Donna did it by absorbing the mind of a Time Lord. Martha did it by herself - no superpowers, no wibbly-wobbly, just her walking and surviving the stricken Earth for a year. :)

Edit: just to clarify that last paragraph. Martha's achievements in the series 3 finale in no way diminishes the efforts that both Rose and Donna went to to save their Doctors. Their strength of character is enormous. But, in modern Who, there has been a certain leaning towards the Companions somehow becoming ""superpowered"" in order to play their role in the finale.

As for your accusations of casual racism, I do not believe that to be the case.  Her biggest problem was that she followed Rose.  Rose was a hugely popular companion.  If you polled favorite companions, I would wager Rose, Amy, and Sara Jane are the top 3.  The Doctor and Rose actually feel in love.  A mutual, shared, deeply personal connection that most fans wanted to hold onto. Then we get Martha, who is a decent companion, she is likeable, capable, and independent.  But she's the fan equivalent of a rebound relationship.  She's always going to live in Rose's shadow, so no matter how wonderful she is (and I agree with you that she in a fiercely independent woman and there is a lot to be admired in her) she's always going to be Not-Rose to most of the fans.

I've noticed a similar problem with Donna.  While she preceded Amy, they are both feisty redheads that challenge the Doctor and helped him to grow as a character.

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"Your article is a truly awfully written article, even so:

&gt; These ones do not show that 54 per cent of London’s street crimes are committed by black men.

&gt; They do not even show that 54 per [cent] of those convicted in court of street crime are black men. But they do indicate that in 54 per cent of street crimes where police catch their suspect, that suspect is black.

All this shows is that police are more likely to try and charge someone who is black and those people are less likely to become convictions.  This is a self perpetuating argument of course because police stop and search black people more often.

Even so - I can't believe anyone would argue that the colour of someone's skin makes them more or less likely to be a criminal.  If you want to do profiling, surely a better option would be based on the location, age, etc.

PS - I downvoted you for the insult.  It was unnecessary.  If you cut it out you might do better around here and in life generally.

The best selling newspapers by a long way in this country are right wing tabloids, then right wing broadsheets and then at the bottom are lefty/liberal newspapers which are constantly berated despite having little influence (see this thread for example). The BBC also faces similar criticism for being left wing propaganda despite the fact it is firmly centrist (or it could be argued centre-right) and all other media outlets are right wing/corporate. 

The reason why people don't care about economic inequality (or the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer) is because the places where they get their information have a vested interested in perpetuating this system.

When I saw the Season 4 cover art and saw Donna there, I instantly facepalmed and got ready for a season of shit.

To this day, Donna is one of my favorite companions (Number three, with numbers one and two being Rory and Alfred respectively). Rose and Martha are my least favorites now.

You're right: Martha solved problems on her own. But the companion is supposed to play off The Doctor, and never substitute for him. She was a weak character, in the sense that she was naggy and whiny. I really thought that her presence existed just to heap praise upon The Doctor.

Donna, I consider a strong character. She's willful and stubborn, refusing to put up with any shit that she gets around her; but she also a very human side that's very willing to show. Plus, I don't think she ever replaces The Doctor in any context.

I know I'm going to catch some hate for this, but, I was not a huge fan of Rose. I think she was entirely too needy, selfish, dimwitted, and very emotionally immature.  The point I agree with OP most on is the fact that, Martha was able to move on. She loved the Doctor but she knew it was not meant to be. She was very strong willed and in my opinion part of some of the best parts in 10's seasons (i.e The Master story arc). Rose always seemed to be the one getting them into more trouble than needed be whereas Martha was the one helping them get out of the trouble they were in. She didn't need to absorb the Time Vortex in order to save the world, all she needed was her own two legs and the ability to tell a story. Yes, Rose had some good parts. Mainly when she came back to help them defeat the Daleks and helping Donna but even then she still didn't exhibit any of the strong qualities that Martha had. I think the worst part of Rose is how she treated Mickey, her boyfriend at the time. She put him through so much and all he wanted was to be with her. He risked his life and everything for her. She had the nerve to get upset when he decided to say in the parallel universe, but guess who was there after that. Martha Jones! Her and Mickey got together and made each other happy. That's probably one of my favorite bits. Sorry to turn this into a Rose bashing session but it seems everyone puts so much stock in her as a companion and I just don't think she is that great. Out of all the companions in the reboot, Martha Jones, in my opinion, had the most to give, was the most interesting, and strongest companion the Doctor had.

Interested to see if AVB tries it later in the year.

As to my takeaways;

In ""Human Nature / Family of Blood,"" she spends her first year utterly alone without the Doctor.  She is there to protect the Doctor while he is in his human status, all the while being looked down about by just about everyone she encounters, including the Doctor.

Let's take a look at Amy.  There has been a running theme through season five and six, that Amy is still the awe-struck child, falling the Doctor on a whim.  She has some strong points, but nothing ever that really significant, compared to Martha.  Oddly enough, I believe her best moment was in her second season, when she saved the space-whale, and all of the space-ship London.

true,maccathesaint,null,null,"I prefer the shorter series format we have here, for the most part it keeps the comedies funny and the dramas compelling.  

Take Sherlock - it's an amazing show, but i couldn't see it working anywhere near as well with 24 episodes of 42 mins each.  The 1 1/2 hour format works brilliantly for it, the production values are exceptionally high and the stories are near perfect, there isn't a line of dialogue wasted.

In response to bluefold, i disagree with your reasoning for British TV having shorter runs.

Look at the IT Crowd for example.
Nearly every episode was written by Graham Linehan and no one else (2 episodes of the total 24 had an additional writer).  He even said at one point during his [Reddit AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lix9h/iama_man_named_graham_linehan_creator_of_the_it/c2t1tvq) that they tried to write a fifth season but he brought in extra writers to help with the work load but for various reasons it didn't work.

The US Office - Maybe one person will write a couple of episodes for a series, but they have a huge pool of people writing individual episodes or co-writing others.

Writers keeping control of their work has always been a standard in British TV...in the better shows anyway.  Sherlock has a total of 3 writers, who have each written 2 episodes - and at the very least Moffat and Gatiss both have several other commitments ongoing (not least writing Doctor Who as well).

The framing was awesome. Fuck the Orange Order indeed. Sing it loud. Don't be afraid. Fuck bigots. Don't be ashamed to say to follow the reality of the situation. You don't need to legitimise them just because you want to appear even. Fuck the IRA too. And fuck anyone who instigates sectarian division. Fuck both sides of the shitty divide.

The truth is, enlightened people don't engage in bigotry. Don't give the bigots the power to frame discussions, as if their idiocy warrants respect. It doesn't. What the fuck are you thinking?

The title was fine, and it has more value in it than some mealy mouthed relativistic bullshit title that lends legitimization to what is nothing more than a bigoted, hateful incident. If you've forgotten that hateful bigotry is something that should be treated with scorn and derision, and you're more concerned with sitting in some central ground that legitimizes hateful bigotry over simple logic, then you're a pseudo intellectual guffbag and you're missing the point - and you have my pity.

Clint Dempsey, Yan M'Villa, Dembele, Berbatov

replace Livermore with M'Villa, Sandro with Dembele

Berbatov to add some striker depth

Dempsey seems to want to move to Liverpool for some reason but we have been much better than Liverpool in the past few years and if the right offer was made I don't see why he wouldn't come. Dempsey is very versatile and can play winger, striker, or just in behind the striker and scores a boatload of goals.

M'Villa is a good holding mid, probably better than Sandro and definitely better than Livermore. 

Dembele is very creative and deserves to be at a much bigger club than Fulham.

Berbatov will be cheap, he wants out, he's already played here and is sort of a legend, and you know what to expect, goals. He would add a good deal of depth to our striker position.

It did have a few good ones though. Human Nature/Family Of Blood, the entire finale, and Blink were really great. They weren't showing us anything new about the doctor in the episodes. The dalek episodes did nothing but make them from the feared race into the most easily defeatable enemies in the series.

Plus, it's one of the very few sports from which meaning and reliable predictions can be made from it's statistics. So many aspects of the game can be narrowed down to very specific 1 on 1 confrontations within larger ones.

Take the ""at bat"" for example, the primary unit of play in the game. It's all of these things:

* defensive team vs. offensive individual
* series of batters vs. defensive team
* the same but flip the team vs. individual dynamic
* pitcher vs. batter
* pitcher and catcher vs. batter
* the situation in outs, balls, strikes, runners on base *and* which bases they are on at any give number of balls, strikes, and outs
* more than a hundred years of data that proves that statistical probabilities hold true for nearly every possible situation in baseball

Having said that;

-  whilst I don't agree with their scepticism on man made climate change I completely concur with their drive to embrace nuclear and to stop focussing on renewables for our day-to-day energy needs, certainly ending the windfarm subsidies.  Lower fuel bills on the 'doorstep' would be very popular with bill payers.

- Plenty of people think austerity has gone too far and spending in government services and infrastructure is a way to stimulate the economy.  Plenty of people are aware that the military spend has been cut in recent years.  Given that they were also against action in Libya and for pulling out of Afghanistan, I'd suggest that these policies carry a lot of support in certain popular circles.

- Whilst not a fan of the 'BritDisc' idea and would rather see fuel duty going directly to transport links you'd have to be pretty insincere to water their entire transport policy down the the 'BritDisc', because the big thing is by far them saying the money saved on EU union would be spent on transport and rail networks.  When I go skiing in Europe if I drive I'll often spend a considerable amount to use French roads because they have a toll road system.  In the UK toll roads are a rarity and I wouldn't want to see them become more common - but essentially France has a 'FranceDisc' system where foreign lorries pay towards the roads, only it's done through tolls.  I don't see how a UK  port-toll for lorries is much different.",0,1345952038,null,0,false,0,c5yu16a,t3_ytere,t1_c5yu16a,t1_c5yqm57,null,1429737165,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

FWIW, I think Martha/Freema is beautiful, strong and intelligent. In short, everything I look for in a woman (little crush here :) ). That being said, I don't think she rates as a ""top"" companion. My favorites (in order - more or less) are Donna, Leela, Wilfred, Cap'n Jack, Sarah Jane, K-9, Lady Christina, Amy, Mickey, Rose.

Martha doesn't hit my top 10 because she is black or because I didn't like her character; she doesn't get there because there was something ""off"" about her which I think is more to do with Freema's acting style than anything.

Just my .02
 
*Edit to Add:*
After some time to think about it, I think I can say WHAT about Freema's acting bothered me: she vassilated her approach to the character. Sometimes she would be really into the character and making it her own and just running with it brilliantly.

I have been  trying to think of ways to pull it off, but there is such a large number of people who have expressed interest. I was even thinking of possibly opening an Etsy account to sell shirts I make every now and then. But here is the main deal my fellow Whovians, if I were to keep making/selling Doctor Who shirts for all of you, I am afraid that somehow I will run into legal trouble from profitting on merchandise of an enterprise that I do not own. Long story short, I don't want to get on the bad side of BBC legally. I know that this may be an overly paranoid move, but I really just want to be careful. If I had a billion dollars I would spend my early retirement making and giving them out to you guys for free (no Apple tees though, I'd be broke). So I am very sorry to those of you who really wanted to get one, but honestly you could make one yourself that looks just as good with less hassle than dealing with buying one from me. I am more than happy to answer any questions on how to make these. It really is not hard at all. The stencil took me 1.5 hours to make and the spraying took about 20 mins including prep. It cost me about $5, not inlcuding the shirt, to make. Best of luck to all of you!

I haven't been on /r/Doctorwho for very long, so I have yet to see a post like you describe. Had no idea she was disliked.

Martha has always been my favorite for all the reasons you stated. She was an awesome capable person that was a strong female character who didn't have to learn her usefulness **from** the doctor. But also wasn't some super trope-ish tom-boy either.

And I didn't think her crush on 10 was a huge thing, it was always just lingering there from what I recall - a lot of women love him - what's the big deal? And then she got over it like a real human being. 

What the hell is there to hate? Oh no, a strong female character that doesn't have some huge emotional issue who thinks she can't do anything or is too scared to do shit! WEIRD. These are the reasons why I have disliked, well, Amy, Dona, and Rose until they finally grew the hell up. 

I don't think Martha is disliked because she's black though, it's because people enjoy huge love drama and Martha wasn't huge on it and didn't really have to ""grow"" into a new person like the other companions did. She was already a whole person without much personal issue. Yea, she had some, but not compared to the others who had their lives staggering because of it/disliked some major aspect of their lives for it.

Martha is also my boyfriends favorite because of the same reasons. He likes to say ""She was the only one who didn't cheat!""

Rose's Bad wolf thing, Dona's part time-lord, and almost from thin air  ""ultimate true love"" between Amy and Rory, to be cheating into awesomeness/power/save the day. While Martha persevered and saved the world with her own skills.

Let's not make the assumption everyone who dislikes Martha has to like Rose, Donna, Amy, etc. For some of us, comparison is not relevant. We can critically look at all companions and point out what we like or dislike about them independently. In other words, just because someone says Martha's constant pining for the Doctor is annoying, doesn't mean they prefer the Rose or Amy relationship. A lot of fans simply don't like the idea of abundant romantic attraction between the Doctor and his companions. Also, there's a lot of bashing on other companions too. Just ignore the immature ones and look for the real discussions before passing judgement about the racist undercurrent. 

Additionally, despite her gorgeous appearance, her acting just doesn't quite cut it for me. It seems bland and one-dimensional.  Her go-to Martha in distress expression comes to mind. But let's chalk it up to personal preference. 

Now, let's look at the progression of Martha's character. Intro episode of S3, she's intelligent and capable - so overall very likable. Then the subsequent episodes she fends for herself, CRUSHES ON THE DOCTOR, solves problems on her own, CRUSHES ON DOCTOR, works full-time in a racist, sexist era to support the Doctor and helps him remember, OMG DOCTOR I WISH YOU'D LOVE ME BACK, etc etc. It's not that she's not brilliant by herself. Her rebound storyline unnecessarily overshadows her capabilities. That's what bothers me. Hell, she's the strong one who walks away, what a badass! Except it's only because her unrequited love becomes unbearable. 

So basically, I wished the writers went with a storyline dominated by Martha using her intelligence and strength to resolve difficult situations. Sadly they were more interested in her emotional journey. Much like the Liz Shaw arc, I was disappointed that they somewhat wasted the intellectual female companions.

&gt;She is different with the fandom,and she was different with the writers and it's because Freema and Martha are black. It's so obvious it hurts and every time there is a post online about her you can see the underlining feelings that people have for both these women. It's horrible and sad.

The tone of racist accusation is very off putting. If you intend to have a discussion with people, you shouldn't imply they are racist before even talking to them. You don't even back it up with any examples of comments you have seen, so personally i find this incredibly annoying and pretty much don't want to talk to you, but I'll set that aside, assuming the better and that is not what you meant. Perhaps you just felt a bit overzealous in your wantingness to defend her. Even though ""wantingness"" isn't a word, i can't think of a good way to put that.

Martha was a love struck puppy, it was constantly in your face and it was annoying. Do i need more of a reason why i don't like her? She was training to be a doctor and ends up becoming a solider, to me that is a betrayal of values.

Her episodes were amazing. But she as a character was not. She felt very two dimensional to me and that she was intended to be a love interest. Like she was suppose to heal the doctors love sick wounds after losing rose by being the new love interest, but after seeing the fans reaction to this they made the call to change things in the end.

I'm sorry but other then when they go back in time, what racial strife does she go through?

Shes the only capable companion the reboot had? Seriously? At this point i wanted to say you were full of shit. ALL the companions are capable. The doctor doesn't travel with you if are aren't! He knows what his travels are like.

So rose, who takes in the time vortex just to save the doctor is not capable? Donna(my favorite btw so i may seem a bit bias to her), Who starts out thinking she is not important, and is a whiny little prick, who became the most important person in the universe, who really became better friends with the doctor then any companion was not capable?

Amy, brought the doctor back from oblivion, and was captured by aliens while pregant, who had constant worry over what they wanted with her daughter was not capable?
And lets not forget Rory who waited 2000 years next to a box, drags it out of air raids and fires is not capable?

Come on. Don't feed me this bull.

All that being said. I don't hate Martha. I just don't like her. She is in that grey area of neutral, neither like nor dis-like. Perhaps saying that i like her the least would be the best away to put it.

First off Rose was a love interest.

Donna wanted nothing of the sort. Which was incredibly refreshing.

The other was the character growth.

Rose.... Rose doesn't grow to much i don't think. She was Rose, and is rose, and will be Rose. Nothing much changed with her as a Character other then when she had some trust issues with the doctor.

Donna was someone who yes was mouthy but she didn't think much of herself. She felt unimportant and not talented, dispite how capable she was. She was also kind of whiny and annoying (not as bad as Micky when he was first introduced though) . She changes alot though and by the end of her journey she is truly confident (unlike before id say she had a front) and knows her worth. 
And then all of that growth is gone. Which was incredibly sad. To me, sadder then rose being trapped away. Not only does the doctor lose a friend who i really feel is the closest he has been to someone (who was just a friend) in the reboot but Donna, is now back to her old, ignorant self who doesn't think she is worth much.

To me that is much more tragic.

true,Commander_Monkey,uk,Bournemouth,"I live in the New Forest, and would recommend the following places to visit:

Lyndhurst- typical tourist town but does all your cream teas, museum and ice creams. Also lots of hotels and B &amp; Bs.

Beaulieu- Great palce to actully do something other than just see the sights, it houses the National Motor Museum (currently with 007 special and Top Gear Challenges cars) It is also a fantastic place to go for a walk along the Beaulieu River, which you can also rent out boats, canoes and Kayaks from.

Calshot- Former RAF station for seaplanes but now a great beach and sport activity centre, it has a velodrome and rock climbing wall and a castle.

Burley- A former 'Witch' town but again its brilliant for a day visit, also has a very good YMCA and 3 fantastic pubs that I know far too well for my own liking.

Lymington- the largest town in the New Forest, very good High Street with a excellent market on Saturday, again offers boat rentals and a ferry to the Isle of Wight (which in itself is very good) 

Ashurst- small village inbetween Totton and Lyndhurst, its generally awesome as I live there and its worth the mention but really only consists of a Post Office, a damned good Indian and 3 Pubs (I'd highly recommend the Happy Cheese)

Pretty much the entire Forest is open to have a wander through but beware it can get pretty touristy. Just for the love of god do not feed the ponies!

In terms of Ancient Forest, the entire place was created by Royal Command on behalf of William the Conqueror and as such has been largely left alone. TBH you will need a car as the buses are terrible and there is only one rail line passing through the Forest but you can easily get the train into Southampton or Bournemouth (shameless plug as I work for Bournemouth Council) but its the Bournemouth Air Show next weekend which will be truly brilliant, with everything form the Red Arrows, Battle of Britain memorial flight to the Marines staging a land assault on the beach.

'You think so? I didn't see her that way but oh well.' 

'I don't like Martha because she's too needy.' 
'RACIST!' 

OP, I think you should point your accusatory finger at yourself. 

First, the facts as you present them. 

* Martha is possibly the least-liked companion of the reboot
* She is different from the others because she's black
* The reason people don't like her is because she's black. 

Allow me to make some assumptions myself. 

* A majority of your contact with the Who fandom, namely those anti-Martha, is via the internet. 
* You do not look at the profile of everyone you meet. 
* Most people don't put anything in their profile anyway. 
* Therefore I feel it is safe to assume you've not met most of these people or even seen their faces. 

So you: 

1. Are assuming all or most of the anti-Marthas are not black (possibly white). Therefore you, while you accuse others of being racist, are stereotyping like a pro. 
2. Call Martha different and point out that this difference is her skin color. Which means you do not see all races as equal. You can't be different but equal. It doesn't work that way. In order to be equal you must be the same. If you had two water fountains of equal cleanliness and quality, but one was for whites only and the other blacks only, it's still segregation. 
3. See the world through colored lenses. The very first thing you mention about her is her skin color. You only start to talk about her other attributes nearly halfway down. It would not have occurred to me that most of the vitriol was race-related. YOU thought of it though, which means you see racism where there probably isn't any. 

I don't like Martha and it's fine if you do. You point out a few things. And I'll admit that part of my distaste for her was not her fault. It wasn't race though, it was that I was a Rose/Ten shipper. Still am. She was another woman, an intruder who only went along with him because of her massive crush.

The reason why you haven't voted for the monarchy is there's no real support or call for a referendum on it.

As for what it'd do to tourism (and why they should be reduced to this nucleus issue considering all the work they do, I don't know) it'd turn the otherwise regal grounds into being not much different to the other palaces on the continent but without the somewhat USP of there being an actual Queen living in them.  It'd be like pouring mayonnaise on the British holiday, it'd just be that little bit blander.

You can try and argue that tourists and foreigners don't care - but the Royals never fail to sell a magazine when they're on the cover and there was a certain not-so-little wedding recently that went to show they have international appeal.  People wanted a slice of this special taste of Britain.

As for taking their titles away and that they'd still consider themselves Royal is silly nonsense to consider it would be the same for the people that care, the majority of the country.

As for no revenue stream being hurt that's delusional.  The state benefits greatly by the monarch of the time managing Crown estates but turning the profits over.   Nothing in government or the private sector solution could even come close to that, or their efficiency; it's positively bordering on altruism.  Other than that Royals using their positions have actually been catalysts in creating whole new industries.

65p, most people love them, the majority of the rest don't think electing a head would be any better, they do a lot of good work, and the fact that they're conditioned from birth to be stately puts them in a league above any other head of state that has to hit the ground running just to keep up.",0,1345987959,null,0,1345991973,0,c5yypjo,t3_ytmog,t1_c5yypjo,t1_c5yyisq,null,1429739366,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

All he was able to really do was bring in Mata and Meireles, Mata being an unqualified success. Then he gets fired because his transitional team isn't winning all its games. Granted the only player that RDM has bought who has cracked the first team is Hazard, but then again he *is* lighting up the premiership, having scored or assisted 7 of our 8 goals this season. One player like that makes a colossal difference, especially in a team that's biggest shortcoming last season was probably its lack of penetrative dribblers. Also Torres is on completely different form, and, despite his massive cup performances, Drogba didn't play very well in the Prem last season, scoring just 5 in 24 appearances.

Ok now we to go Tottenham. He gets thrown into the team and day one loses his best player (argument could be made for Bale I personally think its Modric). The team goes out and loses away from home to a team that finished just 4 points behind them last season, and then gives up a brutal last minute equalizer in a game they dominated.

4)Because it was damaged. So it repaired itself.

I'm glad she moved on, and I'm glad she became stronger. I was sad to see her go, mostly because Donna annoyed the HECK out of me at first, but it was refreshing to get a woman traveling with the Doctor who honestly didn't want to be romantically with him.

Hythe - Small town halfway down the waterside, calls itself the gateway to the new forest because you can get a ferry across from Southampton which goes past the main cruise terminals. There is cycle hire available as well I think.

Brockenhurst - Only exists because of its train station and the college, couple of tea rooms and newsagents on the ""high street"". Hire bike from next to the station or start walking and no matter which way you head you'll be in ancient woodland within 3 minutes.

Bucklers Hard - Near to Beaulieu, in fact most people will do both, leaving their car at the car park nearest the coffee shop they want to use at the end. (The one in Fairweathers garden centre is my personal recommendation) Its actually an open air museum dedicated to shipbuilding, but most people know it for the walk.

Personally I suggest you use the car as little as possible, bring or hire bikes to get around, with rail for the longer stuff. Most of the charm of the new forest is what you see between places when you go off the beaten track and explore a bit (just make sure you either have a map with you or a charged phone with GPS and pre cached map tiles).

The truth is, there is no completely legal way to watch the show unless you purchase it, or are a subscriber to something like BBC or Netflix.

The use of a proxy server to identify your IP address as being in the UK has been discussed.  UK citizens are allowed to steam the show for a limited time after they air on BBC, via the iPlayer software. This is due to UK citizens supporting the BBC directly via taxes. This video streaming is not allowed to people outside of the UK, but using a proxy server has been reported as a way to access the show via the iPlayer. I'm unsure as to the legal/moral issues surrounding this practice, but as a practical matter, I couldn't get it to work for me.

And she genuinely cared about things that weren't herself. I always thought Rose was a little selfish. Go back and watch Planet of the Ood.

River Song: [whispering to Amy Pond] They're trying to make him angry. 
Bob: I'm sorry, sir. The Angels were very keen for you to know that. 
The Doctor: Well, then, the Angels have made their second mistake because I'm not gonna let that pass. I'm sorry you're dead, Bob, but I swear to whatever is left of you they will be sorrier. 
Bob: But you're trapped, sir. And about to die. 
The Doctor: Yeah, trapped. And you know what, speaking of traps, this trap has got a great big mistake in it. A great big whopping mistake! 
Bob: What mistake, sir?

River Song: Always.

The Doctor: Oh, just jump. High as you can. Come on! Leap of faith, Bishop. On my signal! 
Father Octavian: What signal? 
The Doctor: You won't miss it. 
Bob: Sorry, can I ask you again? You mentioned a mistake we've made. 
The Doctor: Oh, big, big mistake. Really huge. Didn't anyone ever tell you? There's one thing you never put in a trap. If you're smart, if you value your continued existence, if you have any plans about seeing tomorrow, there is one thing you never, ever put in a trap. 
Bob: And what would that be, sir?

Sterling looked like he was a perfect fit - not overawed like some of the more experienced and expensive signings of last season, and if he was a bit taller/stronger (and Marriner, who I otherwise like as a ref, wasn't such a dick towards him) he'd have been perfect. 

Borini looked better as the game went on, Shelvey was much better than Hearts, Kelly was more than solid defensively, Coates only had that one bad moment where he dawdled in the first half.

Then you consider the Virgin trains to Scotland. I've been on a trip to Glasgow and a few to Birmingham from Euston. In all cases I was quite happy with the journey and impressed with the trains and service.

It would seem a shame to me for Virgin's trains to be gone.

I remember hearing a story, years ago, about Virgin. The idea was that Richard Branson would look at the biggest buildings in a city and see what industry they belonged to: clearly they had the most fat - and so he'd start a business to compete with the fat cats.

I genuinely believe Branson goes in to create businesses that are better than the ones they replaced. Unlike the likes of EasyJet which are sold off at the first opportunity to the next corporate slasher.

All this being said: I have no idea what this BBC article means. Run the line for free? I thought all these train companies were bidding to *give* the government money.

His voice cracked constantly, his jeans were too short, and he looked out of place in his own body. Today I saw a Shelvey who was began to understand what his new body is capable of. He still had some of those awkward voice cracks and a spot of acne here and there but in the end he looked much more like a young man then a teenager in puberty.

I've been saying Allen needs to be in the DLP role. He moved the ball much better than Lucas does. He took pushed the ball on the attack and kept it off of Skrtel and Coates's feet. Far too often Lucas keeps it back with the defenders which, as we saw, is a disaster waiting to happen. I'm going to stick by my Allen needs to play in Lucas's spot after this match.

Skrtel, well, this is why you are a CB....

Gerrard isn't the same player he once was. That makes me sad.

Sterling got lost a bit but came through when he was needed. Kid will be good. Kid will be real good.

Suarez, please, shut your mouth. You had a great free kick and did well at getting the ball into space, but you as soon as you made a bad pass you started yelling at teammates. When the ref missed a call, you started yelling at the ref. After awhile it starts to look bad and gets you into trouble. Keep the passion, shut the mouth.

2. Our defence was, in general, far better than hitherto this season. This despite losing Lucas at the beginning. Apart from the two stupid gifted goals, a lot more solid. Coates looks like he has the mobility to play in the new system, which I had worried about, so that's good.
3. Suarez is incredible, Sterling is wonderful and I like Borini a lot, but I'm really not sure where 65 goals are going to come from this season.
4. Joe Allen looked great. He cost more than Xabi Alonso, but perhaps it's because he's better!
5. Back to the score: it was never handball for the free kick that Suarez took so superbly, so I'm really not too unhappy.
6. ""Control"" is the word Brendan Rodgers uses most, and in this game we had it. Even without Lucas. And I think we can only improve.
7. I've been saying Martin Kelly can't really do the attacking fullback role as well as we need, and I may need to take that back. Still not sure he can do it twice a week for a whole season though.
8. What's up with Reina?
9. Shelvey and Gerrard both had better games today, although I'm starting to think that when Lucas is fit and Sahin is settled in Gerrard might not find himself in the best 11. Difficult decisions ahead for the boss!

* Thought Kelly could have done better with the first conceded but it looks like it came off Skrtel's head so it's hard to blame anyone.
* We took a while to get in to the game in the first half with City playing 3 at the back and having so many bodies forward but I don't remember any clear chances for them (apart from Tevez, which would have been an amazing/lucky goal) and eventually we got a foothold and definitely held our own/had the better of City for the rest of the game. Became 50/50 in the last 20 or so.
* Sterling was class, as was Allen. Joe reads the game so well and just keeps possession ticking over. Sterling was his youthful best, not afraid of taking on the champions. Losing Lucas early was harsh but Shelvey came on and fitted in well.
* Suarez was his usual menacing self, missed a few chances and then scored a beauty of a free. Loved the way he was dropping deep to receive the ball and turn and run at defenders.

She would always make one of her panicked faces an look around to get some kind of OK. Not to mention that she was supposed to be smart/educated by real world standards and not just the timey-wimey-the-writers-can-make-up-whatever-they-want way. (from her first episode it really bothers me that chest compressions, even on both sides for 2 hearts would resuscitate someone who has been drained of all their blood. What was she pumping around if there was no blood in his circulatory system?!) 

She did alright when she was on her own, not dependent on the Doctor's blessing - family of blood, wandering the earth telling everyone she's in love with an alien, the doctor's daughter when she is separated from Donna and the Doctor. But whenever they were together she was just whiny and dependent when she was supposed to be some strong, educated woman. Donna had more backbone, and she was just going off her moral compass, not multiple years of medical training.

Why it got so messed up with 10's regeneration is something I'm still fuzzy on and I can't accept the ""well, they're connected"" answer as a pat canonical answer. I think there might not actually BE a truly legit answer and they just wanted a set change so they invented a reason for one. 

I have a few thoughts on Ten's ""I don't want to go"" line...I think on the one hand, The Doctor really liked that version of himself. He'd grown and matured in some fantastic ways and he had come to terms with a lot of who he was and what he'd done in the past through Ten. I also think it was a small nod to Tennant, because he really did want to stay on for another season but it didn't work out. 

The TARDIS doesn't really regenerate, that I'm familiar with. So far as I can understand, it's a weird mixture between the Time Vortex energy that the Heart of the TARDIS contains, and what basically amounts to a software program that creates everything physical that they interact with.

The centre is great, varies a lot. The Odeon cinema is much cheaper than the Cinema De Lux, but not as flashy. The standard and most popular clubs for a student would probably be:

For indie/hipster type stuff, along with 51*27 which does some good bass and electronic orientated music, Thekla is alright. It's a club on a boat by Queens Square. There are special nights with different genres every Monday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday (I think). Look it up. 2 for 1 drinks are also common here.

For indie/chart type stuff, along with the preppy/chavvy/people who don't usually go to clubs, Syndicate can be alright. Wednesday is Killa Disco, which is okay, but you should be with a large group of people and be very, very drunk to really enjoy it. It can be pretty shit sober, but you will meet a fuckload of people here. Lots of girls too, but lots of ""lads"" on the flipside.

Stokes Croft is great, used to be pretty ghetto but it's very up and coming &amp; trendy now. Visit the Canteen to definitely meet other students, lots of live bands there and at the Croft which is up the road.

St. Andrews park is excellent for relaxing in the sun, beautiful place and in good weather it's full of people. Also next to Gloucester Road.

Cabot Circus has great high street shopping but it's pretty expensive. Cool looking architecture.

Good place for some football or a bbq (think it's illegal now though) is the Downs. Google that, very large flat area of grass. Same goes for Ashton Court, but that's further out.

there must have been a reason why he didn't let Sterling roam and had Johnson much further up the pitch, but at the same time let Suarez and Borini switch around a lot while not giving them much backup from Kelly.

There wasn't any set positioning from Borini or Suarez where you can say one was central and the other was wide, they moved around a lot. I just don't know why it wasn't done on the other side as well and why there was a bit of a tilt on the left-hand side.

A player like Borini you can't just leave him in the middle all game as the guy between the two center backs. It just becomes too predictable and he doesn't have the strength, turn with his back to goal to do much. I liked how he went wide and mixed it up with Gerrard filling in the hole.

* Skrtel scored an immense header, played brilliantly all game and went to pass the ball back to Reina i think but played it too short, Tevez intercepted and scored.

* we played honestly poor for the first 20 minutes, but after that we played brilliantly, kept the ball, kept pushing forward and made city look bad.

You will need:

-tardis template (http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs39/f/2008/347/7/c/TARDIS_stencil_by_adams_ransom.jpg)

-x-acto knife

-foam sheet ($0.89 at Michaels)

-glue stick or spray adhesive

-spray paint (I used white textured fabric spray paint from Michaels, but it is a pain to use as it makes puddles and soaks the shirt. I'll probably use normal spray paint next time.)

Instructions:

1. print out the tardis template. (I made mine about 18"" tall by printing on two sheets of paper and taping them together)

2. tape the template onto the foam sheet and cut the dark parts out of the template. Make sure that you plan on leaving extra little bridges of foam to hold the cut out pieces in place, the template doesn't draw these out for you. You can refer to mine if you want: http://imgur.com/5tnVj (making the stencil takes a while so be patient, the detailed lettering is pretty difficult)

3. Put a piece of cardboard inside the shirt to keep paint from bleeding through the back. Apply a thin layer of glue on the back of the stencil, especially detailed parts like the window panes and lettering. Lay the shirt where you are going to spray it and stick the stencil in place, smoothing it down to adhere it. cover the exposed sections around the stencil by taping down thick paper or cardboard. Spray the paint over the shirt (if you end up using the fabric spray paint from Michaels, make sure to cover everything evenly, if it puddles then take a lot of paper towels and dab gently over the paint to remove excess.) When the paint has dried a bit, take a nail and write the words as best you can onto the tardis sign.

4. When the paint has dried for the most part, carefully remove the stencil and other stuff. Use more tape and paper to cover just the tardis design. Find something to fling paint with (an old card from a deck, a folded piece of foil), spray some paint onto the thing and fling drops of paint onto the shirt. Repeat until you have a full field of stars. If you happen to fling a blob that is too big, use the nail to pull the paint into the spiral arms of a galaxy.

5. Have a beer and admire how classy you look in your new shirt.

Best of luck to everyone!

Here's my solution, and call me crazy if you want to, but how about not intentionally pissing people off?
You know how black people would stay away from white neighbourhoods back at the start of the 20th century, not because all of them weird scared, no, but because they didn't wanna get an ass-whooping (or worse).
It's called common sense and needs to be emplored here in N.I.  Loyalists shouldn't march close to Catholic neighbourhoods as, obviosuly, the Catholics will get pissed the fuck off i.e. Ardoyne every year.  Yet both sides insist: ""this is our land and we will fight for it!""
It's redundant and ridiculous and every Protestant and Catholic, as far as I'm concerned who live in these inner-city areas have blood on their hands, as their community is acting on their behalf when they do this.  Instead of preventing their community members from this violence, they sit on their arse and do fuck all - hence any injuries/death lies with the community as a whole, in my opinion.
**TL;DR: Don't piss people off intentionally and there won't be a problem - common fuckin' sense.**",0,1346009587,null,0,false,0,c5z3062,t3_yv2z9,t1_c5z3062,t3_yv2z9,null,1429741454,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2

Personally, I loved Donna - every second of her.

Scenes in which she cries never fail to get me to choke up in sympathy and on television this is something only suffering animals could do for me. 

I do understand how people can hate her, though. I can see what they're saying. For me she toes the line between being hilarious and obnoxious - for other people she probably crosses it way over. 

No point in wondering how people can love/hate something we do not.

Remodel your house installing an overflow over the doorway that drips. Put in steps on the front path that have uneven tread and height.

&gt; Personally I see the BBC as very left wing, being (and as much as I hate to pigeonhole things into left/right) to the right of it myself.

So, to start with I'm talking about my personal view of the BBC being very left wing. That's not that I'm saying it *is very left wing*, but that from my perspective *I see the BBC* as very left wing. I then make a statement that I don't like the left/right pigeonholing but that if I had to, I would be to the right of the BBC. This is why I see it as 'very left wing'. You may see it as right wing, because perhaps your views correlate with hanging more to the left.

Where this all falls apart is that I don't really believe in left/right wing as anything other than to reduce choice in political debate and to oversimplify what are massively complex issues. So if I have to describe myself in wings, I might say I was mostly right wing but left wing in some areas, but I'd still argue the toss that I don't think it's as simple as wings.",0,1346018930,null,0,false,0,c5z58rm,t3_ysufk,t1_c5z58rm,t1_c5yy6ts,null,1429742518,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In 2009, I was on deployment to the general Indian Ocean area, and we pulled into Thailand. One thing I love about the place is its vibrant industry of making cheap, knockoff everything and selling it for reasonable prices. One thing that caught my eye were the vibrant colors of the counterfeit soccer jerseys. So, I went to one of the kiosks selling these fake garments and asked what kind of England or Ireland national team shirts they had. I looked at the wall of red English jerseys and one with the name of some guy named Lampard had the number eight on it, which reminded me of NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. 

So, I bought it, wore it a bunch (as a strange way of rebelling against what I thought to be cultural norms), did some research, and discovered the Blues. Next time we pulled into port (Kuala Lumpur, four months later), I tracked down an actual Adidas store, went in, and nabbed a Chelsea jersey (turns out Malaysian extra large is not really that large in American sizes), and I haven't looked back since.

true,pbhj,uk,.,"Here are some figures, they're not the best as I only took the first good looking result Google gave me - http://www.doeni.gov.uk/partial_ria_single_use_carrier_bags_regulations.pdf

Is from NI it gives details of pre and post figures from a voluntary scheme they ran as a precursor to introducing new measures; this doc is an impact assessment of retaining *status quo*, introducing a legal levy, continued voluntary scheme, etc..

The figures are estimated but rely on Welsh and Scottish figures as well as those from the NI voluntary scheme to model the expectations, see pages 8-9. They show a decrease in SUB (single use bags) of 360 million with an increase of 40 million BL (bin liners) and 10 million extra reusable bags. Actual figures for the voluntary scheme are shown too.

Similar document for Scotland - http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/57346/0016899.pdf.

They note in the Scottish one that all models lead to reduced littering. That the best produces a 4000 tonne reduction in plastic bag use per annum but that this is only a ¼% of annual household waste. See page 21, again estimates. On page 30 we see that under proposal 2A, levy on both plastic and paper bags the total reduction, accounting for increased purchase of bin liners and greater plastic use in reusable bags leads to an expected 3200 tonnes of plastic and 1800 tonnes of paper saved from use in bags (pa, across Scotland). These figures use results from the Republic of Ireland's PlasTax scheme and a study by Carrefour to make the models realistic.

Same for Wales from 2011 - http://www.assemblywales.org/sub-ld8664-em-e.pdf.

I'm sure you can find actual figures from the last couple of years if these aren't good enough to show that charges will, do and are working. (In addition large businesses save money and in the RoI case the Revenue makes money too that can be routed to environmental causes and reduce general tax burden).",0,1346020240,null,0,false,0,c5z5jn7,t3_yor0j,t1_c5z5jn7,t1_c5xhmz7,null,1429742662,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
true,oag721,smith,Smith,"I think what I like about Amy is that she cares about the Doctor like a father, but doesn't hold him in the superhero light; she pokes fun at him and such. I wouldn't call it bossy. And if you think she's bossy, watch *The Ribos Operation*! What I love about Romana there is that she is one up on the Doctor.

I think the issue with Amy is that people can't see past their inital impression of her. Whether it was the kissogram thing or the end of ""Flesh and Stone"". I think she has matured a lot, and there is a big difference in the way she was portrayed in series 5 and series 6. In series 5 she was a little loud and was sometimes just strange, but near the end of that series she becomes much softer. The Doctor really is her father figure, although she may not want to admit it. She was ridiculed as a child for believing in him, after all.

Based on my own personal experience, I think the love she realizes she has for Rory in ""Amy's Choice"" is due to the fact he was there her whole life, liked her, and she treated him badly. Then he ""died"" in that episode and she realized that she needed him there. I think I love the flaw in her character there: she wasn't perfect all along, and she does need someone.",0,1346020246,null,0,false,0,c5z5joq,t3_yv3sm,t1_c5z5joq,t1_c5z4lie,null,1429742662,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,GuyOnTheInterweb,uk,Stockport,"I've generally been a fan of Virgin Trains since 2005; but it might be mainly down to the good feel of the Pendolinos compared to what many other operators run.  The Voyagers they ran to London I did not enjoy, they are very tight and claustrophobic; it is like a preparation for the London Underground. Bring any luggage and you are fucked - as any available space gets filled with people.

The Pendolinos do have their faults; those big toilets tend to break down and often a carriage will be superheated. 

Having a shop on board is such an improvement from the trolley service you might find elsewhere, in particular when you can get a decent coffee rather than a 60 degrees nescafe. (The shop fridges are less well stocked now than in 2005, though.. I remember them having loads of Virgin Cola and many kinds of salads, etc)

As a business traveler, electricity socket at almost every seat and WiFi (mind you, WiFi is only free in first class) has been great. That ""improved mobile signal"" has never worked for me, though - even back in the days when I had a Virgin Mobile contract!

First class on Virgin is brilliant and can really be worth the upgrade - but in the weekends Virgin did this on the cheap.  If you go in the week, you get a hot meal (served with proper plates and cutlery), wine, coffee, etc. In the weekend, you take your ticket to the shop, and the guy will make you a nescafe. 

Exactly - not even proper coffee is not included in weekends! I found this out as I ordered an Americano, showed him my first class ticket, and the guy said ""Oh.."" - poored my americano out, and made a nescafe instead. I told him to keep it.  I do sound very posh here, complaining about my first class ticket and americanos, but it was simply one of those ""Two first class tickets are cheaper than an open return"" cases.",0,1346024013,null,0,false,0,c5z6fv4,t3_yus3l,t1_c5z6fv4,t3_yus3l,null,1429743076,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

No, it's not an useful source of information. More than any form of punishment, torture can lead to false statements that could in danger numerous people, who're perhaps innocent.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"We DID pursue him. We were very serious about him. JJ said he was courting us and we thought we had a very good chance, but what happens when the European fucking champions join in with 5x our spending power? The same thing that happened with Oscar, who we were very much in for as well. 

I don't understand why people seem to think we have money just lying around to spend on players like Hazard. Because some paper says we're prepared for a 50m spending spree? The difficulty of getting deals done is so drastically understated on this board it's maddening. 

**A)** We've paid for our collapse at the end of last season. Targets like Hazard, Cavani, Falcao, Llorente, etc would have been incredibly difficult even WITH the lure of CL football, but without it they're fucking impossible. Even Damiao is very unlikely.

**B)** Things like a new stadium and world class training facility cost lots of fucking money--particularly for a club like us. If you look at the way Arsenal have spent when dealing with stadium debt that's quite possibly what we're going to have to deal with. Targets like Hazard will become a lot more financially viable in 4-5 years when the stadium is meant to be finished. 

**C)** The economy is absolute shit and it does affect the transfer market heavily. Most teams are reluctant to part with their best players for anything but a king's ransom. Some targets are even too expensive for clubs like City, who have only bought one player. 

So let's look at two examples of situations. Say we want to buy Santi Cazorla. He's affordable because of Malaga's financial situation, awesome. But too bad, he doesn't want to join our club because we're not in the CL and various reasons.

Okay, now let's go for Oscar. He's a young player who is happy to join us, but wait, a bigger club with much more spending power jumps in and Inter understandably prefers to take 25m over 15 or whatever it is we were offering. 

Situations like Vertonghen are incredibly fucking rare. A player who 1) is available cheaply because of his contract situation and 2) actually WANTS to play for us. 

That's just how it is. If you think we aren't TRYING for targets you're wrong. I suspect we'd spend if we were ever in a position to land someone like Aguero (we were rumored to have bid 38m but some people have rubbished that) but it's pretty difficult to get deals done for the aforementioned reasons.

Players would rather play for clubs like Chelsea and Arsenal (to say nothing of City, United, Barcelona, Real Madrid, etc) than Spurs because these teams pay significantly higher wages and have more success in terms of trophies. And clubs would rather sell their players to clubs like Chelsea, City, Barcelona, Madrid, PSG, etc because they pay bigger fees. 

This isn't football manager.

I completely understand that signing players like Damiao, Llorente, Lloris, Moutinho, etc is going to be fucking difficult, but that's who we're targeting, regardless. The board either needs to get the big names in, or just scrap the idea and go after the Michu's, the Pizarro's, the Valerjo's, the Rondon's, etc. Get players that are a touch risky, cost 1/5th of the price of one of our current targets, and let them have a preseason, let them play with the team for more than a day and a half before their first competitive match. If we don't have the finances to sign the big names, we need to get our shit together and stop trying. 

We've pissed all our depth out the window this summer, we're losing our best and most important player, still only have one suitable striker, and the season is already underway. If we had a decent scouting system set up, we could've landed plenty of quality players for reasonable fees, had some depth in every position, and been off to a flying start like Swansea have enjoyed.

We're waiting so long to do everything that every club under the sun is just going to jerk us around for astronomical prices for half assed players like Willian, and we'll end up with 16 senior players and our new signings being 34+ years old. We fucked up last January, and if we fuck up again, we can kiss Bale, Walker, and Sandro goodbye next summer.

Consummation like marriage is defined by the union of a man and woman being the echo in the flesh of the spiritual union and being the point at which the marriage proper could not be annulled.

Ilderton discusses at length whether the Bishop of Edinburgh or the Bishop of the lands in question should have jurisdiction (this appears to be based on the precedent of *Robins v Crutchley 1760*, another dower case but one I've not had sight of). It seems in the summing up:

&gt;*shall we then assume jurisdiction to try matters arising in a foreign country, without even the colour which the fiction of the parish of St Mary le Bow in the ward of Cheap has so long supplied? Certainly not: of matters arising in a foreign country, pure and unmixed with matters arising iti this country, we have no proper original jurisdiction ; but of such matters as are merely transitory, and follow the person, we acquire a jurisdiction by the help of that fiction to which I have alluded, and we cannot pro¡ceed without it: but if matters arising in a foreign country mix themselves with transactions arising here, or if they become incidents in an action, the cause of which arises here, we have jurisdiction, and according to the case in 12 Mod. the fiction need not ba resorted to at all, and if resorted to, the effect will be not to give jurisdiction; and if a pl»ce had been before named, for that part of the transaction which arose here, it would have no effect even as to the trial. In the very infancy of commerce, and in the strictest times, as I collect from a passage in Brooke, Trial, pi. 93, the cognizance of matters arising here, was understood to draw to it the cognizance of all matters arising in a foreign country, which were mixed and connected with it, and in these days we should hardly hesitate to affirm that doctrine.* //

that the conclusion is that it doesn't matter what happened in Scotland as the couple have enacted part of the marriage transaction within the area of jurisdiction of the court and so the demanded dower can be considered due. Mind you it's not at all clear; do you have a better source for it please?

As to the generality of the precedent of that case again it's worth noting that it is assessing the situation of a claim of *dower unde nihil habet* which means that the husband didn't provide a dower (a portion of estates to the wife as a wedding gift that would keep her if widowed) and so the wife is left with ""nothing"" to live on and so the court should award a dower. The court decides for the wife. Whilst in common parlance using terms wife and husband for a same-sex union might not have problems that doesn't mean that references to such in a legal case can be simply construed as applying to people who're neither wives nor husbands.

Even if you were to, say, declare that two women were married in verity in England due to a ""marriage"" in Scotland, that they were both ""wives"" then your precedent means nothing because under it the husband of the marriage has to provide dower. There is no husband, no case. The situation of two males proceeds in the same way. The law surrounding dower only makes sense in the context of males and females in their roles as husband and wife in a middles ages [middle class!] Christian marriage, the judgement is whether dower is due and doesn't appear to stretch [much] further. Either party could also apparently claim the marriage nul through lack of consummation (barring cases involving transgender or chromosomal abnormalities).

&gt;*We are therefore of opinion that the Demandant is entitled to judgment in her favor.* //

To recapitulate the judgement doesn't answer the question of whether the marriage is valid in England, it relies on venue considerations for commercial transactions and decides that some part of a marriage transaction was in the courts jurisdiction sufficient that it is right - lacking other precedent - to award the dower.

There must be EU law that's [far more] relevant here.",0,1346028780,null,0,false,0,c5z7mf6,t3_yoryj,t1_c5z7mf6,t1_c5y3b1x,null,1429743634,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"Nah. you can self-source a reprap for around 500, though I don't recommend that unless you are a master of all things DIY. Getting a kit for a reprap will probably set you back around 700-1000. Commercial printers run from 500-2000. All prices USD.

If you want a project, go for a reprap. If you want a product, go for a commercial printer.

The best reprap is probably MendelMax right now, but there are several others in beta stages that look very promising. Mendel90 and Rostock both look very nice. You could also do a Prusa, but I don't recommend it because the frame is not what you might call 'rigid'.

The best commercial printer depends on your budget. In the 500 dollar range, there is the Solidoodle, which I cannot vouch for. It's relatively new and untested. If you're willing to spend around 1.2k, the MakerGear M2 is a solid choice. If you just want the best, the ultimaker will set you back a hefty 1.2k euro, plus some pretty crazy shipping for us Americans.

I'm not going to write out an essay, because frankly there are better guides out there, but if you have any questions feel free to PM me.
