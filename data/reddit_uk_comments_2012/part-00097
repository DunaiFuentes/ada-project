Whatever positives immigrants bring are considered irrelevant, since these people believe they have incontrovertible proof that they are the harbingers of social decay.

true,fuckyouimbritish,null,null,"I've posted this elsewhere, but I think I'd like to tell it to you too.  Britain is the definition of a multicultural society. This is not a recent change, it's what we have always been.

We were a bunch of tribes that through war and peace intermingled. We were the Picts, the Britons, the Celts and others.  The Romans came here and made us a little more Roman, in return we made them a little more British. The Vikings, the Angles, the Saxons, all came to wage war in our land and stayed. We assimilated their culture, their words, their people.  That all of these cultures were white is nothing but a coincidence of geography - we have always been a multicultural nation.

When we became the conquering empire, we did the same thing.  When we occupied India we shared Britishness with them, and they shared their culture with us. The same happened in Ireland, Hong Kong, Africa and the Caribbean.

This cultural adaptability, this ability to assimilate and be assimilated, is more than anything the defining characteristic of Britishness. It's why we punch above our weight culturally, why our influence is felt in cinema, literature and music so widely for such a small nation. It's our best feature, and I'm proud that we showcased it to the world, we shoved it in China's face after their stage managed cultural anaemia, shoved it in the face of ~~UAE~~ Brunei, Qatar and Saudi Arabia that have only just got round to allowing women to compete, and shoved it in the face of the idiots who don't understand what their own country is all about.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Yes I have dreams all the time. I've always been having weird dreams. I write them down, I have a dream journal. Here's one part of a 3-part dream I had a couple weeks ago which I purposely wrote in a semi-story format:

It started on a fairground carnival, where I was me, or the 8th Doctor. There was grass, wooden fences with petting zoos and buildings with stone archways. Lots of people running about. And there was a little boy. He had run off from whoever should've been keeping an eye on him. He wandered up to this strange box. Perhaps it was blue. But he opened the doors, and inside there was a very large room.

It was a strange bedroom. With clean white and black tile floors and windows lining the left and right sides. A bed sat against the wall in the far right hand corner. The back wall housed two bookshelves, each on either side of a double doorway. The bed, shelves, and doorway almost looked like the kind you'd find in a grandmother's home. Old fashion. Kitsch.

Meanwhile, somewhere else in the dream... I was me (or the 8th Doctor) and I was looking for this boy. I ran to a small outdoor day care where kids ran around inside a wooden fence. Nobody had seen him there. I ran up the hill from there up to the buildings with stone archways and look around there. From this high vantage point (for the main carnival was within this grassy valley) I still could not find the boy. I searched for hours. It had become markedly darker by the time I gave up. At this point there was no telling where he was.

And so, I returned to my strange box (which I had discovered with shock in an earlier, yet unknown portion of this dream). In there I sat on the edge of the bed in exhaustion. The carnival fairground fell away, and it was only my box and I. Opening the doors at the back wall, I stepped onto a balcony.

This balcony overlooked the rest of this tall room, two staircases descending to the floor on either side. It was dark. The only light that shone was through a stained glass window near the top of the ceiling. The beams of light landed on me. The room itself, was an all encompassing blue.

It was quiet. Not even my footsteps down the stairwell made noise. There was no sound until I reached halfway down the stairs.

At which point I was attacked by an apparition. It seemed to have the faces of myself and my past seven incarnations. Their faces were screaming at me, grabbing and throttling me.

Someone appeared from behind the bottom of the staircase. An old man. He told me the apparition only looked like my past selves. Because that's what most fan theories would have this apparition be. But a more diligent mind would imagine it as something far worse.

And I recognized this man. I had never seen him, but I knew who he was. The little boy. The whole time I had gone looking for him, and he was inside all along. Aging and withering away.

If you want to avoid hearing about what a large majority of the public (or whatever group you're around), you're responsible for staying away.  Anything else is unrealistic.

Society is based on the transmission of information - don't want information?  Stay away from society.

Promoting anything else beyond the reality of a healthy society talking about things is harmful.  It makes people more ignorant.  Is that what you want?  More ignorance in the world?

My top tip for being a fresher is to fight hard any feelings of nervousness and just talk to people.  Most folks there are as nervous as you, and freshers week is the time and place you get most opportunities to meet folk.  So talk to your neighbours, go on some of the pub crawls and tours (but don't get too drunk!) and just chat to anyone you see.  A couple of months later when you've got a great gang of friends and a social life you'll be happy you did!

Also, go to the societies and sports fairs - they get all the student societies - everything from Guinness Drinking to Hot-Air Ballooning in a hall and you get to go chat to existing members, find out what  they do and sign up to try cool new stuff.

true,Turil,k9,K-9,"We've already nicely labeled this community.  It's for talking about Doctor Who stuff, generally for the most up-to-date news and events related to the show.  If you don't want to know that, and are expecting the tens of thousands of people here to avoid talking about Doctor Who and it's most recent news and such, then you're being rude and unrealistic.  

Here is my original comment on the main thread:

&gt;A better option would be to say that all posts are likely to include information about current and past and future stories unless specifically marked. But also say that no post title can include specific important details about current season plot twists (but basic info like titles, actors, obvious monsters, etc. are ok, since these are very general info that most people already know).

&gt; Most people are intelligent and respectful enough to simply stay away from this community and other public discussion if they haven't seen an episode yet and don't want to know about it. But allowing for posts that are spoiler free to be included here, and keeping real spoilers (as opposed to general info) out of post titles gives people a little more wiggle room if they are desperate enough to show up and want to talk about older stuff. Seems like a really respectful and balanced approach to me.

Arguably the most well known thing the UK has right now in today's age is Doctor Who. You can't say you wouldn't answer ""Doctor Who"" if someone asked you ""What is the thing you know of the UK outside of the Royal Family?""

Doctor Who has been around for nearly 50 years now. It's become their pop culture icon worldwide. With the logic of them showing the evolution of the UK through the industrial revolution, etc. They couldn't see fit to include today's ""era""? Oh wait, they did! Social media!

So why wasn't Doctor Who included almost at all during that age? That boggles my mind. Oh wooooo, yayyy, we got a TARDIS noise over top of Queen. People watching would more than likely say ""wasn't that just another part of the song's performance?"" instead of picking it out as ""Oh, Doctor Who!"" Only the diehard Whovians would take notice.

That's what frustrates me about the whole opening ceremony thing. Doctor Who is at least in the Top 3 things the UK is known for right now, and we got overshadowed by a Queen song.

EDIT: It was also hilarious to hear friends say ""well it was planned but got cut because Mr. Bean had an extended segment.

Yeah, the principle being that if they give this one a free pass, then every fucking comedian will think it's okay to pull stunts like this. It's not okay, it wastes valuable security and police time which would be better served looking out for real terrorists or making the whole airport security thing run faster and smoother.

But hey, it's ""just a joke"" right ... until some nutjob Tweets he's going to blow up an airport, and then does it ... Ha ha, very funny. Oh how we will laugh.

Here's another ""joke"" you may enjoy (hypothetically) ...

A guy Tweets ""if this movie doesn't start soon, I'm gonna start shooting random people"".

Are you still laughing ?

Sometimes, you HAVE to make an example of someone, or the whole world thinks it's just another thing that you can ""get away with"" unless someone specifically posts a sign saying ""please do not Tweet about bombs in airports"". And you want to talk about common sense winning ? Some things you just don't say in certain circumstances ... anyone with a modicum of common sense would KNOW this.

How about we call it 6 of one, and half a dozen of the other, and not waste any MORE taxpayers money compensating an asshole for being an asshole. Billions of people every day DON'T pull dumb shit in high-security areas, and surprisingly don't get their lives disturbed ... so perhaps he can man the fuck up and say ""yes, I was wrong"", and stop with the ""my life is ruined"" bullshit and the compensation demands.

In particular, Americans seem to think that the USA is the 'best' country in the world for whatever reason, despite falling rather short of Norway, Sweden, Lichenstein etc in almost any test of standard of living you could devise. Also the whole 'freedom' thing that Americans have is just weird, they are about as free as any other western developed nation, they just shout about it more.

There are plenty of things the UK is more known for than Doctor Who, whether you like it or not.

As for Mr. Bean, it's not a question of recent relevance in a show that basically is encompassing all of history. Mr. Bean is far and wide the most recognizable British TV show and character.

But all of them seemed to have trouble picking out the final teammate/back of the net.  Hopefully this is just a temporary lack of chemistry.

Brad Jones has the best hair hands down.  If you get him to stop smiling and put on a suit, you could shove him into an episode of Mad Men

Morgan's breakaway got me really pumped up...but he seemed like he didn't know what to do with the ball once he got it.

I agree that Luka wants to leave and that Real Madrid are only willing to go so high - I disagree that Levy cares.  I don't see any indication whatsoever that he's willing to meet RM in the middle.  Every day the story is that his price hasn't changed and he's happy to wait until they meet it.  Where is the idea that this is an actual negotiation coming from?

I agree that we should be able to afford Moutinho - but literally every source out there is saying we *won't*.  Including the one that you just linked to.

&gt; However Spurs will not meet Porto’s asking price of £24m for Moutinho

My entire argument is that we *should* be able to afford that asking price but are seemingly unwilling to do so.  Same with Damiao, although I actually think that price tag *is* a little inflated and am not necessarily mad Levy won't pay it.

Essentially you have this optimism that Levy is going to be willing to make these deals, and I'm not sure what it's based on, since for the most part his approach has been to name his price and then simply walk away.

We're reading all the same transfer rumors, with the same prices listed as everything, but you seem convinced all of these will work out, despite the fact that no one is saying as much.  Where is this optimism coming from?  That's all I'm asking.

Last year the Men in Blazers called Swansea the ""Welsh Barcelona"" - I think that's a very accurate description.  I just don't see AC being a great player as the focal point of that type of a 4-3-3.  Put it this way...do you think Barca would have the type of success they do with a guy like AC leading the line?  Probably not.  He needs cross after cross pinged at his big pirate-y head, and he'll excel.  I just don't think that's going to be our style of play while Rodgers is here.

&gt;  I doubt Carroll is ever going to be more than just a target man.

I agree with a lot of your points, but I think saying he'll be ""just"" a target man is a little more harsh on him than is necessary.  He is THE prototypical English center forward.  I really think he's going to have a very good career, he's just not a great fit for this iteration of LFC.

&gt;  I very much doubt anyones going to come in with £20m

I agree.  If he'd be willing to agree terms with West Ham, I'd take the 17 they're supposedly offering an call it a day.

Yes. I am willing to say Doctor Who has more fans than Monty Python.

""Whether I like it or not"". Who the Hell says I wouldn't like it if there were other things? The fandom doesn't ""grow"", it blows up every single year more and more. Doctor Who was one of the most anticipated and WANTED panels for Comic-Con the past 2 years in North America. Moreso than most other panels. But yes, it's still only a ""cult hit"".

If you actually believe that Doctor Who has a bigger fanbase worldwide than Monty Python, you are deluded. Doctor Who never exploded in popularity until the new series. Before that, it was a notable sci-fi show for people who could catch it on TV where it was broadcast. It was famous for being a cult hit for decades. It's only escaping that stigma in recent years.

I don't think you even read what I wrote past that point properly. You missed what I meant with ""whether you like it or not"". You just repeated what I said about the growing fanbase too and acted as if it was a counterpoint. 

And your biggest argument for its fanbase being mainstream is *Comic Con*. That's exactly where cult hits go to be very popular in the mainstream for a few days. That's all shows like Doctor Who, Firefly, StarGate, Battlestar Galactica, etc. are. Very, very few shows escape cult status and go into mainstream territory. Has your average Midwestern housewife heard about or seen any of those? What about Star Trek? Star Trek's probably the best example of a cult hit that went straight into mainstream popularity. 

And, while I do think the TARDIS noise was awkwardly shoehorned in there, playing it by itself would have been awkward in its own right. They just play a weird crescendo while people move around? It's the sort of thing that comes for a visual representation that they just did not have in the final performance. 

Mr. Bean bombed in NA? When and where? It's not regularly shown but it's often referred to in many places of North American pop culture, moreso than Monty Python or Doctor Who. /r/videos freaked out when they say Mr. Bean and the post with the Youtube video of him reached about 2.5k upvotes before it went down. Hundreds of comments were from American redditors loving it. In fact, I didn't actually know there was a Doctor Who reference until I browsed into here. So there's that, in a way of direct cultural understanding using reddit.

The key here is that asking prices are rarely purchase prices in football, particularly where Daniel Levy is concerned.

Both of those clubs can hold tight a year and either use the player (Modric) or accrue a higher value (Damiao).  With Modric, he has no need to budge.  With Damiao, he might.

Follow this logical thought process: To be entitled to something that has a cost is to be entitled to the wealth of others, since you're entitled to it somebody has to pay for it if you're unable to. To be entitled to the wealth of others is to be entitled to their labor, or at least the fruits of it. Entitlement to the labor of others is the dictionary definition of slavery. Do you now see why it's a slippery slope to have things like healthcare declared entitlements?

1) Like everyone is saying, Bassong should be gone, but for right now, while he's still with us, I would much rather see other people get playing time and get to gel with the back line, because it's clearly not going to be Bassong.

2) Harry Kane is not ready, but he most likely will be in the near future. He looked good today in flashes, but has shown over the first few friendlies that he's not quite ready to be a 1st team striker. I would say a full season loan to a mid to mid-low table team and he might be ready to be the #3 or even #2 next year.

3) Townsend continues to impress and while I don't think there's any way he breaks the starting XI, he might play a very big role when it comes to the various cups and even Europa league.

4) Huddlestone is getting back to form nicely. Played some excellent balls today and someone managed to get Gallas an actual scoring opportunity. That's damn impressive on it's own part.

5) Spurs look like they're really adapting to AVB's possession and create plays starting from the back approach. I thought they did a very good job of that today.

&gt; Survivors of the Bhopal gas leak in 1984 held their own special version of the Olympic Games in India on Thursday as a form of protest against the sponsorship of the London Games by Dow Chemical.

&gt; About 80 disabled children ranging from ages five to 16 took part in 10 sports in Bhopal, in protest at the company's link with the International Olympic Committee and Dow's refusal to increase a 1989 compensation package for victims of the leak.

&gt; As many as 25,000 residents of Bhopal died in the aftermath of the gas leak at a pesticide factory that was owned by a subsidiary of Union Carbide in 1984.

&gt; ""The London Games organisers are trying to greenwash the crimes of Dow,"" Dhingra said.

This is not to say that teaching qualifications are required to be good at teaching, or even that they necessarily make you good at teaching. They could do with some reform. However, it is important that there is some oversight and quality control involved in entrusting an incredibly important task to people. 

Education is vital both to individuals and society at large - it isn't easy, and it should not be treated as something about which no one cares.

I would suggest hanams for a meal, but its at the top of the royal mile and so will be too busy to get within a mile of. If you like indian, try either the Red Fort (drummond street) or Ghandis (bread street). If you get tempted by the Nile Valley Sudanese place, ignore the temptation, its awful. 

As for pubs, Dagda is tiny but has good whiskey and friendly people. The Auld Hoose has good music (rock juke box), great food, and pretty good beer. The brauhaus has great beer, but will be so full you wont physically be able to get to the bar or possibly even in through the door. The barony has good beer, and often has live music shows that are damn good. 

For clubs, whistle binkeys has good live music, but is totalyl packed even when its not the festival. Banshee labarinth is good fun if you like goth/rock/punk though very easy to get lost inside. I was part of their opening night entertainment, and yet I'm still finding rooms in the place. On the upside of that though, is that there is usually somewhere to sit if you look in every room until you find one that noone else has found yet. The caves is worth a look in if there is anything going on in there, as the venue is just amazing. I won't spoil the surprise, just go in and have a look.

Primary schools back then were a lot looser with the syllabus, mine in particular as it was a C of E ran school so they did a *lot* more religious stuff than my children do today. Literally every single history subject was picked because of it's relevance to the church, the reformation, Guy Fawkes and so on. 

There was also no testing at all till you did your mock exams in the fourth year. I don't know about now but when I was in secondary school the teachers got to pick from a set list (they were still learning the new system as well which did not help) and I went to a *incredibly* liberal school - there was no school uniform for a start. This resulted in every history lesson being ""safe"", one glaring thing I remember was when we did slavery we focused absolutely on America and no mention was made in our own involvement. There is no way our history teacher would have done the Victorians because of colonialism because that's just how our school was.

 We did have two very very good RE teachers, one lasted a year before being asked to leave for not sticking to the program and teaching us about world religion, turning up in different religious outfits and so on (he went to Africa to do safe sex education) The other lasted two before  they found out he was teaching subjects like religious views on abortion and encouraging us to  discover what our own were.

2 strikers are something the club needs to buy / loan 1 immediately.

Defense is perfect. That's sorted. Goalkeepers are good for 1 more season too.

But if the club decides to sell Luka, which we are most likely going to have to do, then we need a replacement for him. As much as I like Huddlestone and Jake, they aren't good enough to replace him. Spurs will need to spend majority of the money they get from the Luka deal, to buy a replacement (such as moutinho) who they've been looking at.

So... once we get:

* 2 strikers.

* Luka replacement

* Cover for bale and lennon.

However, the constant drive for better figures and higher Ofsted rating will mean that they choose highly qualified people. They just won't have a teaching qualification.

There are too many people teaching in schools with generic qualifications not tailored to the subject that they teach. What schools need is people who are successful or competent in their chosen field. University students in the key academic subjects (English, Maths, Science), business people, scientists, artists, etc.

- They could be outstanding business people who can actual teach kids how to start and run a business. 
- Ex-University Professors teaching English Literature.
- Sports coaches who have trained amateur football and sports teams.
- IT geeks straight out of University with a good degree and a passion for programming.


The list goes on. They just won't have the formal teaching qualification. Sure, it can be argued that they won't be suitable to teach. They might not be good at it.

Here are the in detail pictures. 

http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?VISuperSize&amp;item=230824732482

_______
Click on Picture number 1.

As you know last season our kit had a darkblue - light blow horizontal stripe pattern. You will notice in Picture 1 that the engraving ""Final Munich 2012"" is written on the dark blue part of the shirt.

Now click on picture 6 which shows a zoomed in photo of the engraving. Notice that magically the engraving has moved from the dark blue stripe to the light blue stripe.

___________

Now click the last picture 12. It shows the engraving is on the dark blue stripe but also notice it's clarity, size, font and quality. 

Now click back to picture number 6 and see the shitty machine sewn (hand crafted my arse) engraving at the wrong part of the kit.

_________

Again click the last picture number 12. Notice how the kit color is darker and crisper than any kit you bought. Also notice that wherever there is a part sewn on the kit (patches, colors, stripes etcetera) the part is thicker than the rest of the kit. It also seems to be badly done and kind of overlapping.

This my friend is not a bad thing. These kits have way better and extra material used. These kits for the big occasions are hand sewn not made with machines. They contain stronger thread that is made to withstand all the pushing, shoving, shirt pulling the players do. Adidas and shirt companies feel the blow when a player is wearing a kit and it rips during a match. If you gave Drogba to wear your megastore bought jersey then he would return it to you in 3 pieces after a tough match. That is why these are made with much better material, better to the touch and are even heavier. Those of you who have a match worn jersey can go check it out and compare it how different it is to any kit past or present. I have a Lampard match worn Jersey and it is 1.5 times the weight of any megastore jerseys I've ever bought.

Now click back at picture 1 and see the horrible colour, machine sewn joints like Adidas were running out of cloth, worse logo etcetera. This kit is made by an automated machine with little or no regard for quality. This is the kit we find at megastores.

And on top of that these are not Drogba's signature or hand writing. He also never gives these kind of autographs and he certainly would not hand his last, most important shirt over to someone to sell over E-bay.


_________

Conclusion : This guy has more than one of the Drogba match worn jerseys from the patches I've noticed and he is most likely scamming people. He might have some genuine jerseys and mixes some fake ones in for the profit but this is definitely not the real one. If it was it would be on most sports websites. The real jersey will auction if it was going to sell and it will sell for a hefty load of money and not 3,500 pounds.

But if you employ non qts teachers, the school/academies can decide what to pay which I'm guessing which will be as low as poss. So I expect to see academies boasting of profits with teaching staff on £12k..

Hi there, 

I'm from the UK and I learned that the tribute in the Opening Ceremony to those who died in the 7/7 terrorist attacks on London had been removed in a planned editorial substitution for a recorded interview. Can you please explain to me how you can justify disrespecting the families and loved ones of those who were killed on 7/7 in such a callous manner? If such a substitution were to be performed by the BBC (or any foreign broadcaster) for a 9/11 tribute in a future American Olympics ceremony, there would be huge political scandal.

I hope there is a huge political scandal regarding this. I will be writing to my MP and the BBC to log my complaint, and so will lots of other people when they learn about this.

The only way to make amends would be to fully and publicly apologise for the disrespectful omission and air the scene prime-time, unedited as it was intended.

If a TARDIS is officially ""a time machine"" then, the full English plural would be ""TARDIS time machine**s**"", which is a bit anti-climactic and seems a bit redundant given that we're used to ""TARDIS"" meaning ""time machine"" anyway.

Maybe we could have ""TARDIS transportation device**s**"", but that's just as unwieldy.

We could go for a ""sheep"" pluralisation and leave ourselves with ""TARDIS"" as the plural as well:One TARDIS, two TARDIS. That sounds weird.

And with all these reverse-wingers (e.g. De Bruyne, Sturridge, Hazard, Marin etc.) I really wish we have some traditional wingers that actually put some crosses in for Lukaku to hit. Our offense is too narrow, and the constant reversion to long-balls (Luiz *cough*cough*) from defense to CF is ineffective. Also our defense is really lacking in pace besides Luiz and Ashley.

Really would like to see a pacey right back, back-up targetman striker, and a cross-providing winger before the end of the transfer window. ",0,1343523880,null,0,false,0,c5kx0am,t3_xbkfw,t1_c5kx0am,t3_xbkfw,null,1429495874,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Lukaku got a good run of minutes so good for him.

Nice for Marin and Hazard to show their value.

We need a RB.

Double pivot needs work. Transition play looked good. Controlled play didn't. Maybe it is a matter of chemistry. Once things click we should be looking good. I hope it doesn't take too long. Maybe oscar can help add to our midfield flexibility.


Edit: also. McEachran, KDB, and Kakuta didn't even make the bench yoday. I think its safe to say Jmac and KDB will be loaned and Kakuta possibly gone.

* Marko Marin for 7 million could possibly turn out to be a steal.

* Lukaku is simply not ready to start for Chelsea and needs to go out on loan and gain some first team experience in an established league, hopefully the PL.

* Malouda/Benayoun need to make room for younger &amp; more determined players. (Piazon, De Bruyne) 

* The remaining ""old guard"" of course still have major roles to play and im sure RDM knows this.

* Even though it was pre-season if were going to be realistic we should have came out with more then a single win. Considering how Milan pretty much lost the bulk of their team &amp; the MLS all stars is just a team thrown together we should have cruised by such opposition and it was a missed opportunity to gain some confidence in our finishing ability up front. 

* Lastly Torres NEEDS a back up striker. Im very confused about anyone who considers only having Sturridge to turn to if another Torres goal draught begins as a viable option. I would like to see an experienced striker who has proven if given the ball he can score goals.

Though once again, I had no idea that they were in a slump and I didn't know how well they were doing because I had no concept of leagues. I also had no idea that they were owned by a Russian billionaire so that had no affect on my decision (although it was nice to know after the fact) Fast forward to January and with a lot of help from this subreddit and wikipedia, I learned so much about the club and game and became fully committed to the club. I was rushing home after class to watch crappy streams on the internet of games and waking up at ridiculously early hours to watch the games. I could not have imagined such an amazing first season and with that I am probably going to be seen as a bandwagon fan but, knowing what I know now, I came into the club during a very questionable time for the season.

Keeping that in mind, there's no reason to be too discouraged. 

But, at the same time, there's no reason why we, as the reigning champions of Europe, shouldn't be able to beat MLS-All Stars in a one-off game that would have proven a great opportunity to gain some confidence and get in the winning habit. 1-1 against PSG i'll take, and 1-0 to AC Milan in a pre-season friendly is nothing to be too worried about, but conceding three and losing to the all-stars really is piss-poor.

true,onthefence928,tardis,TARDIS,"the 11th doctor does hate himself, but not in the same way as 10, 10 was in a recovery state, emotionally, he tried to avoid having a companion because he thought everything he touched turned to disaster and death (which it does i guess), and he often struggled with how much he should intervene in each episode, thinking a monster like him only made things worse.

the interpretation is strongest when you see the companions and human relationships 10 had, ultimatly each one served to set him right and give him hope for humanity and the universe again. each of the companions was strong in human common sense and regularly hammered on the doctor for insensitivity and cynicism. with donna basicly becomeing his overbearing mother.

i imagine it like the companions were his tough-love friends who kicked his ass back into fighting shape emotionally after a serious depression caused by loss.

11 understands and is no longer crippled by unease, he is confident and sure of his purpose again, he understands that he can be a better doctor without holding back, this is mirrored in his new companion, amy pond, who he finds as a brave, proud person, and instead tames her brashness and impatience (ironicly as she is called the girl who waited) and she becomes the conflicted, changing personality. but she is never transformed into a real soldier, she always survives through trust, instinct, and quick thinking; whereas 10's companions eventually became dangerous and powerful by the end, each wielding the unimaginable power comporable to the doctor. rose end up being an inter-dimensional jumper, mickey ends up leading a resistence, donna absorbs the doctor's knowledge, and martha becomes involved in UNIT and is given a weapon that would destroy all of earth.

ultimatly i think 9 10 and 11 all loved AND hated themselves, but 9 was in the anger stage of loss, 10 was in the bargaining stage, 11 is in the acceptance stage.

true,RabidRaccoon,cnty-expat,Expat,"&gt; Please take the time to read the whole article, its absolutely abhorrent. 

What article are we talking about? This one

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2180124/Olympics-opening-ceremony-NHS-disgracefully-glorified.html?ito=feeds-newsxml

&gt; But it was the absurdly unrealistic scene – and indeed one that would spring from the kind of nonsensical targets and equality quotas we see in the NHS - showing a mixed-race middle-class family in a detached new-build suburban home, which was most symptomatic of the politically correct agenda in modern Britain.
&gt;
&gt; This was supposed to be a representation of modern life in England but such set-ups are simply not the 'norm' in any part of the country. So why was it portrayed like this and given such prominence? If it was intended to be something that we can celebrate, that two people with different colour skin and different cultural heritages can live harmoniously together, then it deserves praise.

Looks like they've pulled a bait and switch and thanks to people like you recommending them their page views and ad revenue spiked through the roof. 

I'm sure they're laughing all the way to the bank.

/This is why I don't have an Adblock exception for The Guardian (left wing flamebait) and The Mail (right wing flamebait), even though I look at both regularly.

Incidentally 

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15164970

&gt; For instance, while 23% of all children in Britain live in lone-parent households, among mixed-race children the figure is 38%.
&gt;
&gt; Ordinary set-up
&gt;
&gt; On the face of it this might suggest that ethnic mixing makes relationships more fragile.
&gt;
&gt; But it is worth taking a closer look at table 16 in the Equality and Human Rights Commission report.
&gt;
&gt; Some 65% of black Caribbean children live in lone-parent households and 44% of black African youngsters.
&gt;
&gt; By contrast, the figures for south Asian children range from 10-15%.
&gt;
&gt; Since 45% of the mixed-race population is white/black and 38% are white/Asian, the figure for mixed children overall is bound to be strongly affected by Caribbean and African attitudes to family life.
&gt;
&gt; The overall figure for mixed race may, therefore, reflect cultural domestic norms rather than the fragility of dual heritage relationships.

OMG! The BBC is racist for blaming ""cultural domestic norms"" of Caribbeans.

So the problem he alluded to in the original article is real. In fact that's why it such efficient flame bait for the left.

If you look here 

http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/uploaded_files/raceinbritain/ethnicity_and_family_report.pdf

at Table 16 you see

Ethnicity of Children|Percentage of families which are lone parent
:-|-:
White British|23%
Other White|19%
Mixed White and Caribbean|51%
Mixed White and African|37%
Mixed White and Asian|24%
Black Caribbean|65%  
Black African|44%
Chinese|15%

I.e. Black/White couples have a significantly higher chance of splitting to end up as lone parent families. Chinese and other white intriguingly have a lower chance of this happening. 

What's also interesting is that mixed AB couples seem to have a percentage chance of ending up as lone parents between that for AA and BB couples. 

I.e. when it comes to family values White British does better than mixed White/Caribbean and White/African couples but worse than Other White and Chinese.

true,RyanKinder,mccoy,McCoy,"Re: Eccleston credits... interesting. I just checked the Matt Smith credits and he's listed as ""The Doctor""... Then the credits for the first full episode with Tennant and, sure enough, ""The Doctor."" Might have been that they did the credits for the first series and first episode, it was overlooked and they ultimately kept it that way for Eccleston's season rather than change it.

Re the postcard: I don't consider fan mail letter to carry much weight... especially typed ones that Mr. Baker likely never saw, just signed.

Bottom line, at least in my mind and most Whovian minds I'd bet, is that the characters name isn't ""Doctor Who"" and calling him that is rather odd. That said, the credits for Matt Smith, as mentioned, only refer to him as The Doctor. Never Doctor Who. If the characters name is Doctor Who, I'm quite willing to not twitch when I see it. ;)

edit: Doing more research regarding end credits yields interesting results...

1st Doctor - credited as Dr. Who

2nd - Dr. Who

3rd - Dr. Who

The 3 Doctors special - Dr. Who

4th - Doctor Who

5th - The Doctor

The 5 Doctors special - The Doctor

According to the last census, 1.8% of the population is black. Why, then, were both of the main characters in the ""I lost my phone"" sub-plot of that ethnicity? I am certain that that was a deliberate decision. The ceremony was about the whole UK (""Isles of Wonder""), as was established early on, not just inner-city London boroughs. Why was Dizzee Rascal and his kind of music (""grime"") featured so prominently in the ceremony when only a very, very small amount of people (black or not) actually listen to it? People around the world aren't enamoured with UK music because of ""grime"". They listen to Coldplay, Oasis and yes, Leona Lewis. Where were they?

Am I saying that ethnic minorities should be banned from performing in the ceremony? Of course not. But they shouldn't be deliberately featured so prominently, in some kind of bizarre attempt to boast about how ""multi-cultural"" and ""multi-ethnic"" we are (many other Western countries are far more diverse than the UK).

Please don't fall into this trap too. Are we really suggesting that the racial make up of dancers was politically motivated and somehow engineered? Do we really expect a perfect percentage of racial make up in every group involved?

OK then, seeing as the Daily Mail is popular now, here's a picture of our athletes: [Pic](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/olympics/article-2179224/London-2012-Olympics-Giant-picture-541-Team-GB-members.html)

Can we pretend that the selection of our athletes was also politically motivated as it doesn't fairly represent the racial make up of the country? Clearly there should be more Indian and Chinese athletes if we're to adopt this bizarrely strict new measure of racial equality. Surely the England football team should get rid of Welbeck, Defoe, Cole and Young to make room for the 3% of Indian and Pakistani footballers the team clearly needs.

It's a nonsense argument and I'm sad a few people have actually fallen for it. There were many ethnic groups represented. [Here's one of the dancers experiences](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-18995214). Look at the photo. Are we really surprised black people are over-represented in dance?

Clearly he's alluding to the fact that mixed black/white couples have a higher chance of splitting up than white/white ones. This is something which the person who posted this clearly feels is outrageously racist. 

Still if you look at the figures he's got a point. It's worth pointing out that they've edited the article to remove this paragraph. 

Still from your comment

&gt; Over-representation of blacks...over-representation of homosexuals...over-representation of women.

From what I've read about the ""urban dance scene"" those homosexuals are likely to end up the victims of violent gay bashing. 

E.g. 

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2468329.stm

&gt; The lack of positive public figures reinforces homophobia among the young, says Mr Nelson.
&gt;
&gt; ""The most worrying aspect is that a lot of the homophobia in Britain is coming from young black men. There's black music with homophobic lyrics. And because it isn't challenged they think it gives them the right to be homophobic.""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batty_boy

&gt; Batty boy (also spelled batty bwoy), batty man are pejorative sexual slurs used to describe gay, bisexual and effeminate men, or those presumed to be gay and bisexual. The term is a Jamaican Patois abbreviation of the word bottom into batty; ""batty boy"" is a cognate of the American English ""butt boy"". Usage is commonplace in some Caribbean cultures where homosexuality is condemned, partially as a result of mainly conservative Christian and Rastafarian beliefs. **Sex between men is punishable with up to ten years jail in Jamaica. The country is seen as one of the most violent towards gay men in particular and in 2006 Time noted it likely was the worst place in the Americas for LGBT people and one of the most homophobic places in the world.** In 2009, the New York Times reported on the continuing violence including a case where police were helping a male gay-bashing victim by driving him to a hospital when people admonished them for helping a batty boy, whereupon they removed him from the car and loaded him into the trunk instead

But I'm sure you're right. This ""urban culture"" is far superior to the old one which despite being much better for women's and gay rights was dominated by horrid white people and must therefore be abandoned in favour of the [semi literate, homophobic](http://www.jamaicancaves.org/boom-bye-bye-lyrics.html) and [misogynist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny_in_hip_hop_culture) culture of Jamaican dance halls and US slums just because that culture has a greater percentage of black people.

I know it's a British show, but really, you guys are taking the whole Nanny State thing WAY too far.

We could be spoiling that realization for them and depriving them of that wonderful feeling of discovering that the thing you just fell in love with is [spoiler](#s ""50 years old and existed before your parents were born."")

I know it's only [spoiler](#s ""40 years old""), but there are people who might not have seen it or even known about it! Or even that [spoiler](#s ""Tom Baker was the Fourth Doctor and is often cited as a favorite and inspiration by many actors following him and fans to this very day."")

Your department is based on the Heslington East campus. Currently the only college on Hes East is Goodricke - they are planning on relocating Langwith over there too, but I don't know if that'll be done by October. 

A few things to consider about Hes East: the new 'sports village' is there, complete with swimming pool, so if that's your thing you might prefer to be based there. It's pretty far from town, although there is a regular bus service (the same buses that stop at the Heslington West campus, with free travel between the two). It's been a while since I checked but there didn't use to be a bar on Hes East either, though I think that's due to change.

Ultimately it was my experience that it makes very little difference which accomodation you end up in - your chances of living with decent people are the same, and even if you end up in the few shit rooms that are left it won't detract from your experience.

This is my first offering to the Bristol Reddit so be gentle. Some of you may know me as ""the guy who went to the last meetup but didn't tell anyone his username""

Anyway, tonight, Sunday 29th July there's a free gig on at the Mother's Ruin near St Nicholas Market. It's not my gig but these bands deserve to go far so I'm throwing it for the whole internet to see.

http://www.facebook.com/events/378822908832995/

http://beardedyouthquest.bandcamp.com/
On the bill we have Bearded Youth Quest who play what I like to describe as ""Live 8-bit"" in that they clearly played way too many computer games when they were younger (as did I) and now they've transferred those sounds to analogue guitars/bass/drums. If we're really lucky they'll be wearing their matching capes when they play*

http://soundcloud.com/fallingstacks
Next up is Falling Stacks who you might be familiar with, what with them being from Bristol. They've got a post-punk think going on whch reminds me of Fugazi-meets-a-much-faster-Slint*

http://mayorsofmiyazaki.bandcamp.com/
To finish the evening off we have Mayors of Miyazaki who are guaranteed to put smile on your face. They describe themselves as math-punk and who am I to disagree with them? 3-piece boy/girl shoutiness. Love it*


Anyway, it's all absolutely free and kicks off at 19:30 tonight.

The first person to say ""napkins"" to me gets a free pint :)

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Well okay...this is even longer, mind you. It's the third part of my 3-part dream. I skip the 2nd part because it doesn't have any Doctor Who in it besides things being bigger on the inside. Here we go...

In the last part of my dream, my dad, my brother and I stayed at a hotel that was situated in the middle of a street full of restaurants, fast food, and car dealerships. This hotel was the size of one of those buildings. How you can call that a hotel or what it was actually doing there, I've no idea.

It was nighttime, and we left our hotel and walked into the parking lot conveniently located adjacent our hotel. It was a very large parking lot- mall sized. The building itself was the size of a large supermarket- like a Target Greatland. And we both planned ahead, knowing we were going to split up. Boys take the left entrance to the building, girls the right.

And I walked inside this small room. Warm colors; dark. Red fabrics. That sort of thing. When I went to the desk, the woman told me they only sold entrance tickets for two people at a time. I became worried. How could I gain access without another person? My brother and dad are waiting for me. What if I miss them? What if they go on without me? And as I became more distressed, asking the woman what I could do, there were others waiting behind me. It looked like a couple classmates and their mother. She was very sympathetic to my problems, and after what was a long time in the dream, I was allowed to enter.

But I was worried because by then, there was no way my dad and brother had waited up for me. We were going to go through this fun house together. Walk through all the rooms and let the things spring out at us and try and scare us. This fun house was designed to be a maze or a puzzle.

Unfortunately, when I stepped through the door from the waiting room into the maze, it wasn't a large room in which I could find my family on the other side. It was small. Claustrophobic. And cushioned. The room was probably six by six by six feet. There was one lamp in the upper left corner, giving off a yellow light.

I noticed the left wall there was a large panel. I knew it would open, but I didn't dare look at what was on the inside- something designed to horrify me no doubt. I did the obvious and tried to open the wooden door opposite myself. And as I expected of such a fun house, it was locked. I looked around for a secret lever.

I tapped the walls and pushed on them, I stomped on the floor and jumped. Were the walls closing in? Was it getting smaller? I became more and more rushed. I tried the door I found on the ceiling. Locked. And after much panicking I managed to open the door in front of me.

Whereupon my dream instantly became me acting as the eighth Doctor again, rushing from room to room, fleeing from some enemy. Whatever building I was in was either gone, or far larger on the inside than one would have assumed. Opening doors from one room to another I ran frantic and for my life. Left, right, straight ahead (there's no way out, you're dead). I met and allied myself with random people I encountered who also fled from our unknown adversary.

Next I found myself running into what is, in real life, our back tv room. My comrades covered my back as I dived into the room, the rest of us regrouping. In real life and in my dream, this room has a treadmill and games and a couple windows. But the room is much larger here, or at least, it seemed to be able to hold more people. The windows went down to the floors. And outside was my backyard in daytime. And many people with swords and bows and arrows. These arrows tried to break through the windows and failed.

At this point, I briefly woke up, and went back to sleep. My new location was similar to the maze, except it didn't seem to be related to the building I originally entered with my dad and brother. I was the eighth Doctor again. And my school friends in my back room became my alien companions in a large room with wooden archways. The architecture was church-like. And the enemy of the week, a lone figure, had us all on the ground. We had been beaten. And he said he would take each of our most advantageous traits. He told his higher ups via communicator so. And he took my friend's ear, another friend's leg. Each one changed color and crystallized before he ripped it off. Somewhere in my semi-conscious mind I knew this dream enemy reminded me of the Krillitanes from Doctor Who.

And he came to me last. His hand reached toward my face as he said, ""And you, Doctor. I shall have your immortality.""",0,1343554202,null,0,false,0,c5l2cxt,t3_xb081,t1_c5l2cxt,t1_c5l1vo8,null,1435696842,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,SpasticPanda,flair2,,"A very interesting post. A majority of what you say is, quite frankly, downright convincing.   

Having said that however, there is only really a few point that I want to focus on, if this conversation is going to go any further.  
&gt;Risk and reward in player purchasing and expected outcomes


I think that this is probably the most important idea to dwell on. You are right it saying that there are a few examples highlighted by those who agree that impact players can be purchased for small amounts of money. But surely you have to concede that Tottenham is not the only team which benefits from these purchases? Another example floating around in my head is Papisse Cisse, bought for bargain prices, and ultimately making a huge impact. And yes, for every one of these there are probably equal amounts of failures - but the risk is extremely low. In fact, had we bought Cisse, and had he turned out to be a bench warmer, it is arguable that this still would have been semi acceptable. In the case of say, Andy Carroll, his price was anything but justified by his impact.

Ok, that was a bit of a rant, but I guess my point is that world class players are not always world class. They succeed in systems, and in top flight soccer, the actual skill gap is not always going to be that great between first team starters. It certainly exists, but the system and its fit is so important to success. The evaluation of players which even takes into account their percieved value is a completely flawed mechanism from the outset. It usually is, and should be, the last thing considered - with exception of course. *We should be able to pick up players who will have an immediate and positive impact on the team **if** and only if our evaluation mechanism is both pragmatic and insightful. The fact that Levy takes time to ensure that we are chasing players who actually fit in with our new manager is a promising sign for me. 

&gt;Selling Modric at below his market value, but ahead of the beginning of the season is beneficial for the club.

I suppose this is what I ultimately have issue with. I will concede that a few million pounds is not going to adversely affect either the short term or long term financial health of the club, but this certainly sets a dangerous precedent. Part of the financial health comes from Levy's staunch unwillingness to budge on what he considers a fair price for a player. I think it is one of the predominant reasons also, as to why Tottenham does not field circus offers for it's best players, or indeed offers at all. Any action which undermined the view of Tottenham as a team which protects its assets, and caves in to the demands of players without respect to the financial prudence of the decision, nor the ability to field a competitive team, cannot in any form be considered a beneficial position.

But I do hear you with respect to the training needs of coaches and players. But this point is shaky at best. Player trades happen all the time across many professional sports. Sometimes they are beneficial, some have a certain stickiness which takes time to overcome. Yet it is certainly arguable, that in most cases, these players (given any form of skill equity) are able to contribute almost instantly. We return to the case of Papisse Cisse. A skilled player, no doubt, but far from the ethereal talent of Lionel Messi et al, yet without months of integration he will still able to deliver at an incredible level. So yes I will concede that it is beneficial to give a new manager as much time with his players as is possible, but if we have faith in AVB's system of play, then this point is diminished somewhat. 

&gt;If we're categorically unprepared to meet those prices we should never have sold our other strikers to begin with. (quote)

This is a very important point, and if I was under the impression that future purchases were predicated on the sale of Modric, I would unabashedly agree with you. However this is not the case, and never has been. At a guess, perhaps we have fallen victim to the mentality that teams target players rather than requirements - fallacious and inaccurate as that may be. Indeed, this very quote is based on two significant assumptions - a) that these prices are unshakeable and b) that our players were of a desirable quality. Sure we haven't purchased anyone lately, but leeway must be granted on delivery in the case of personal tragedy. I have no doubts that suitable strikers will be purchased for the team, and not just scrubs to fill the teamsheet.

true,schoettchen,cnty-scotland,Dùn Èideann,"We generally consider them separate parts on a par with other European countries, as in in Scotland someone who is not Scottish will usually be called a foreigner. Northern Ireland is a divisive issue in Scotland at least, where people support either side of the conflict, many of whose elements can be found in some aspects of central-Scottish society. England is seen in a mostly negative light, however this does not translate into bad feelings towards English people on an individual basis (unless they are chauvinistic, which is a common stereotype). In general there is no opinion of Welsh people, since most Scottish people have never met one, I have only once and only very briefly.

It would be very incorrect to say that there is no difference between the different countries, if you have ever visited an English city, it looks and feels different from one in Scotland or Northern Ireland.

It is best to stick to the individual nationalities when referring to someone, however that's not to say that you can't go wrong. Calling someone ""British"" (which to me is perfectly acceptable, unless they're from NI, because all countries are on Britain, much like Norway, Denmark and Sweden are all Scandinavian), can imply the person relates to the British nationality, which can also be quite divisive in Scotland and increasingly in England. When speaking to someone from Northern Ireland, approach the issue of nationality with extreme caution. I have friends from Northern Ireland from both sides of the conflict, so I need to use different terminology when speaking with either of them, here's a quick guide:

- Unionist: Usually from a Protestant Christian background. Will usually call self British or Northern Irish.

- Republican: Usually from a Catholic Christian background. Will call self Irish.

Since it is such a sensitive subject, the best way to ask someone from Northern Ireland about their nationality is with the question: ""Which part of the island of Ireland are you from?"". ""The Island of Ireland"" is the accepted, non-political reference for the whole island (as Ireland would denote Irish nationality). if they answer, eg: ""Lisburn, in Northern Ireland."" Bingo, Northern Irish and British. If the answer is ""Larne in County Antrim"", you can be quite sure they are Irish.

This extends even to place names, like the city of Derry/Londonderry, which is called Derry by the Irish and Londonderry by the Northern Irish, if unsure, use both names, as is done on buses in Northern Irish.

Complicated I know, however it is a very complicated issue in the UK, if it's all too much, play dumb and just ask someone ""what's your nationality?"", as a foreigner people won't expect you to understand all the details.",0,1343558147,null,0,false,0,c5l2p98,t3_xc5fp,t1_c5l2p98,t3_xc5fp,null,1429498626,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,bluegreenwookie,mcgann,McGann,"i agree and disagree with you at the same time. I might just be repeating what you said in differnt words but here is my version.


firstly, yes they did all hate themselves, i do agree with you there.

lets start with 9 fresh out of the time war.

He did hate himself, or rather what he has become due to the time war. The time war turned him into a monster. I really feel this is shown the best when he fist confronts the Dalek. The pure rage he has. I can't help but feel that rage was not really at the Dalek but at what the Dalek's foced him to do, and what they turned him into. This is why it hits such a cord with him when the Dalek says they are alike.

Rose though showed him there is still good in the universe. He had fun with her, and in this sense she allows him to feel for lack of a better term, human. She brought him back from dispising himself, and that is why his parting words were perfect. She was fantastic, and so was 9.

then 10 comes.

They make a big effort to show that this change didn't change who he was. HE WAS STILL THE DOCTOR. He has done some healing, he no longer views himself as a wicked monster. HUZAH, but the pain from the time-war is still burned in his soul, but as long as Rose is with him, that pain seems to dull.

*but then she is torn away from him*

This is when he first meets Donna. When he burns the children who were going to consume the planet. The Solider is back. The monster forged in the Medusa Cascade has shown his ugly, face again. But here is another human that stops him. Saves him. He learns to deal with this part of himself. But then they part ways.

Then martha comes. This will be short cuz i don't like her. Martha the healer, turned solider. The doctor feels like he ruined her.

Donna returns. Finally a friend for the doctor, and the doctor learns to laugh at fate. He is the lord of time so f*** it all, he can defy fate! Donna gets bitten due to this arrogance, and loses the time she had with the doctor.

Enter 11.

Now we have a doctor who has learned to put his solider instincts to better use. He can't let his friends fight his battles for him, IT IS HIS DUTY to stand up to threats, not the people he takes with him. He has protected this planet for a long time, People know him. He knows what he can, and can't do, and he can do a alot, so watch out, or you will face him.

But why talk about that? That's no fun, lets have some fish fingers and custard.

Now this time it's his past the bites him in the ass. It's old. It's tiring. Fighting a war forever isn't something anyone should have to do. He can't win. He just wants it to be over, but it can't be over. Not yet. Humanity can't stand on it's own, it needs the doctor, so carry on. carry on doctor because who will if not you? When if not now?

besides, who can stand to watch a child cry?

**to sum up**

9 hated what he became.

10 hated what he made other people

and 11, he hates that he can't stop it all, and his past is weighing him down.

I followed the many branches of discussion but I'll just quickly respond here because I'm frankly pissed off with the lot of you.

I am **not** voicing an opinion for or against multiculturalism here. In this thread I have been making the point that there are a significant number of people who *do* oppose multiculturalism, and that to ignore them is foolish. Yes, I have given examples of why I suspect people might hold opposition, but that does not mean I condone or hold those ideas myself.

The BBC is privatised explicitly in parts, subtly in others. Privatisation for me is when work is done via taxes but transparency, control and accountability become clouded to nonexistent. The government could contract out road cleaning to some shell cleaning company who then contracts that out to some other company, who then sources front line staff from workfare. In many mays the military is privatised, MI6, seven or eight; that sort of thing. Anything where revenue streams are almost encoded in law would be another form of subtle privatisation. People think the private sector is different from the public sector, but I feel the line between 'the market' and 'the state' is nonexistent. It is part of the same system.

&gt; Cost-effective health care is one of the key challenges for advanced economies with ageing populations worldwide, and we need to move towards grown-up, unemotive debate without labelling and rhetoric (compare this measured perspective to your source of ""evidence"")

Firstly, you talk of unemotive debate and come at me with condescending references to google, and then dismiss someone as *'a trendy 'Student Grant' flirting with the SWP in his second year of university', so that is interesting.

You have cited an anonymous 'perspective' from the economist. There is no author attribution, do you realise that? Digging around a little, I used the google to find where this 'measured perspective' came from.

But things like this will continue to happen until our road infrastructure is safer.

The amount of money we spend of cycling infrastructure is a joke:  (Although it's not just the budget that's a joke, some of the design is nothing short of dangerous)

&gt; I think the Times’ campaign is an excellent campaign. I strongly support what they’re trying to do. Anyone who’s got on a bicycle – particularly in one of our busier cities – knows that you are taking your life into your hands every time you do so. And so we do need to do more to try and make cycling safer. The government is making it easier for councils to install mirrors at junctions. We’re putting 11 million pounds into training for children, and **15 million pounds for better cycle routes and facilities across the country**. I think if we want to encourage the growth in cycling we’ve seen in recent years, we need to get behind campaigns like this. - David Camron

true,widgetas,null,null,"You're asking why can't Christians keep the cultural idea of what marriage is, keeping it as it has been ""traditionally"" been defined? (hope I'm getting this right - I'm responding as though it is).

My simple answer would be (predictably): ""Traditional"" marriage has changed numerous times over the centuries, and there is no set definition of what it represents or its role. Marriages between same sex couples was also not unheard of in parts of the (ancient) world (though not in the UK so far as I now), plus marrying for ""love"" is, I believe, a rather novel phenomenon. 

If the response be: ""Yes but it's always been between a man and a woman. Not a 'man and a man' or a 'woman and a woman'"", then consider the argument given for not allowing women to vote: ""It's always been an adult man"" (of course that argument is as incorrect as the ""It's always been one man and one woman"" given for marriage - those responses ignore all the caveats there have been over the years).

Of course the argument against *that* will return to the notion that marriage is, fundamentally, a religious institution and defined by them. It's not, though, so I fail to understand why people want to ""let the religious have it"" - any cursory investigation of the history of marriages (in many different forms) will make that clear. 

It seems to be some sort of squatters right argument, as though because the term was adopted by Christians and has been associated with them for X number of years, then they somehow have a monopoly on it, and that it's ""unfair"" to take it back.

A point I have to raise again: Friday was the 175th Anniversary of the Marriage Act, when the (discriminating religious) law was relaxed to allow marriages in different-than-Anglican religious, and a non-religious, settings and with no religious aspect at all.

I might of course have misread your response, and you could be arguing against... *making* religious people perform gay marriages? Correct me if I've got things confused!",0,1343576412,null,0,false,0,c5l4umn,t3_x4j8i,t1_c5l4umn,t1_c5l3zaa,null,1429499639,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Honestly, my friends and I are mostly rockers/metal heads, however I hit alot of other bars too. 

Horn In Hand - generally a student bar, with the age group being 18-25ish, doing £1 a pint nights most Thursdays. Great atmosphere as well as it used to be a metal bar, and there's still quite a few that hang around in the bar. Music tends to be a mix of everything.

Pit and Pendulum - A bar with a gothic theme, check out eerie pubs website for more info. Honestly a great place to hang out listen to popular rock songs, in a friendly environment! Remember, the toilets are hidden in the book case, and if they're not open, the handles not all that obvious after a few pints!

The Roebuck - Alot of people saying that it's a ""Wetherspoons so should be avoided"" but honestly, it's the nicest in the city, with a fantastic beer garden on the first floor.

There are many other pubs in Nottingham, but these tend to be the ones that I frequent when I'm home!

As for live music, we've got The Maze, Bodega, Malt Cross, Orange Tree  (which have everything from local acts to very small touring artists) which are the small live music venues, when it comes to large venues, it's Rock City (which doubles as a Night Club) The Nottingham Ice Arena for the bigger gigs, but these are for significantly known musicians.

My prescription drugs are also free (at point of use) so I don't have to worry about not being able to afford them, thus making my condition worse and possibly sending me back to hospital.

I post on a couple of boards related to the condition and the people who are really suffering are the Americans. Almost everyone I chat with is utterly terrified of their mounting bills, people hide their condition from their employers for fear of being sacked and losing their insurance. This adds a great deal of stress, which makes this particular condition even worse.

There's got to be some leeway - but some genuinely see everything should be private, from schools to roads to police to healthcare... Whereas generally we in Europe had a history of that kind of living and decided that we wanted a stake in it. 

That meant that if it was a fundamental of life with no choice involved, we brought it under state control - so we (for instance) nationalised the health services but kept the food supply in private hands as there was always something else to eat instead. 

Some went further than others, but most of us decided that if it was a case of a monopoly (local roads, schools, police, fire service, electricity grid) we were going to keep it under our control so that it provided a universal service and not a ""one system for us, one system for the rich"" that would arrive under a fully private system.

To counter it, you can do three things:

1. Shout and scream against it, belittling everything they say and do. You've then just made enemies for life, and no-one wins.

2. Ignore them. Then some hot-headed idiot goes and does something stupid, like gets enough support to become a congressman and filibusters everything in sight, or worse, goes after people with weaponry in frustration. No-one wins.

3. Include them in discussions and debates. Don't insult them, don't ""show them the errors of their ways"" and most certainly don't exclude them from things. A consensus is drawn up and hopefully both side cedes some concessions. No-one wins out-right, but we can be civil and have a proper discussion about it and move on.

(3) is obviously the better choice. Unfortunately, no-one wants to sit and listen to a well-reasoned debate, they want a good guy and a bad guy and for one overall victor.

Doctor Who is the longest running science fiction program-originally running from 1963 to 1989, had a mostly unsuccessful movie in 1996, but the series was brought back in 2005 and has been going strong ever since.
The show is about a man of another species (a Time Lord) from a far away and now destroyed planet (Gallifrey) who travels around in time and space in his TARDIS, going where he's needed and saving lives. The Doctor has been portrayed by eleven different actors over the years, because Time Lords have the ability to regenerate-to change their physical appearance when they are close to death.

After which, I was quickly submitted to a barrage of tests and scans within the space of a few weeks. My blood and bone marrow were clear, so they decided not to give me radio or chemotherapy unless it came back as they increase the chances of getting leukaemia later in life. I am currently clear after having check ups since February. As they couldn't be certain what the lump was, I doubt I would/ could have had it removed if it had cost thousands of dollars.

true,ibpants,1972crest,,"My parents live in Beswick, less than a 5 minute walk from the stadium and the change in the area is incredible.

When we moved I don't think the Commonwealth Games had even been awarded yet, certainly there was no development.  Where the stadium is was just concrete wasteland next to an utterly incongruous Mercedes Benz dealership that seemed to mock the surrounding area.  It was such a shithole that my parents (who had been able to afford to rent from the council) were even able to buy their council house and still pay less per month than their rent.

The games helped, a lot of wasteland was cleaned up, the stadium was much easier on the eye than what used to be there, and we got the ultimate oxymoron in the shape of a fancy Asda.  I think the B of the Bang sums things up nicely - it was expected to be a gleaming monument to the redevelopment of the area but it was just an ostentatious pile of rickety rust that threatened to fall to bits at any moment.

It wasn't really until Sheikh Mansour came along that things really seemed to start moving.  The much talked about Metrolink extension finally started to become a reality, the rest of the wasteland is being converted and will provide even greater employment opportunities for the locals, my parents' house is now worth a mini-fortune (compared to what they bought it for), and the fucking B of the Bang is gone!

Clayton's still a dump, but things are improving, and with more and more people working in, and visiting the area it can only become a more and more attractive prospect for other investors to develop quality housing, restaurants, etc.

No one knew at that point how brilliant Suarez would turn out to be, so we needed to go in for another striker.  The fact that he's English (home-grown) raised the price further.  Newcastle knew we were flush with cash from the Torres deal and that we were relatively desperate to sign *somebody*.

A lot of factors contributed to that particular bit of business which, in hindsight, turned out to be a worse deal for Chelsea than for Liverpool, though still pretty bad for us reds.

true,[deleted],null,null,"If you can find a tan blazer, it looks like you could do the red outlining very easily with red extra-wide double-fold bias tape.  You could really use any strip of fabric, but the bias tape is not shiny like most ribbon is, and the extra wide double fold will already have the raw edges folded in-- you'd just open it up, slide the edges of the blazer inside the fold, and glue/sew/stitch witchery it on!  [Here's](http://www.artfire.com/ext/shop/product_view/AJStuff/3854654/Wrights_Extra_Wide_Double_Fold_Bias_Tape_Red/Craft_Supplies/Fabric?utm_source=gshopping&amp;utm_medium=gshopping&amp;utm_campaign=GoogleShopping) a link if you don't know what I'm talking about, although you don't have to buy it there-- if a store has a sewing section, it likely has this.  I get mine at jo-anns or walmart.

The shirt looks like you could just grab a button up and put some iron-on question mark appliques-- the internet has never failed me for iron-on appliques, but be sure to double check the size-- some are quite large.  [This](http://www.simplicity.com/p-4359-question-mark-embroidered-iron-on.aspx?VariantID=11098) is the first one I found.  If you're feeling really fancy, you can apply the red bias tape (or a thinner version in the same color) to get those flashes of red along the collar and on the inner front.

As for the vest, if you're really lucky you might be able to find something similar at a thrift shop or online-- although a source I found said the jumper was custom made.  It seems your best bet would be to keep an eye on ebay and etsy and the like for a cricket jumper in similar colors.  [This](http://www.seriouscricket.co.uk/cricket-jumpers) site has some that look promising-- perhaps you could fabric paint black/very dark green over the yellow on the maroon and gold one?  I'd say if you can get something pretty close, the ""tidiness"" of the work is more important than the exact matching of the stripe pattern given that you'll be on TV, but that's up to you.

As for the pants, [this site](http://dw-cosplay.livejournal.com/140134.html) has a wide range of options.  If you can sew, I'd recommend just finding some fabric and making them.  Otherwise, the fabric-paint suggestion on the previous site sounds good if you can't find any good pants.  Since you have a few months, I'd look around online and locally to buy before I messed with fabric paint though.  I'd also recommend pants instead of a skirt, just because I think people are more likely to ""get it"".  However, if you do have to go the fabric paint or making it route, a skirt would be both easier to make or paint.  Definitely a style choice and up to you on that one.

- Blonde on St Leonards (modern European - great lunchtime deals)
- La Favorita on Leith Walk for pizza
- If you've got some cash then lunch at Valvona &amp; Crolla is very nice

4.) The Queen is the Queen of the Commonwealth Realms. There was once a time where Britain had an empire that stretched far and wide, it was the empire on which the sun never set (coined because the sun was always high somewhere in the empire). After WWII, many countries gained independence such as India. All countries that were part of the Empire were now part of the Commonwealth. Some countries which chose to keep the Queen as their head of state are part of the Commonwealth Realms. This includes the following countries:

&gt;Antigua and Barbuda,
Commonwealth of Australia,
Commonwealth of The Bahamas,
Barbados,
Belize,
Canada,
Grenada,
Jamaica,
New Zealand,
Independent State of Papua New Guinea,
Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis,
Saint Lucia,
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,
Solomon Islands,
Tuvalu,
**United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland**.

The Queen is British. She has powers, I don't know a great deal. But I have enough to know she is the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces (for every country in the realms). She is respected I guess in England, Scotland maybe, not so much in NI.

true,NeoNerd,scot-Aberdeen,Aberdeenshire,"1. Why indeed? Team UK makes as much sense, and includes Northern Ireland. The football (soccer) issue is totally separate to the games, really. The UK, unlike anywhere else, has four international teams - England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This is largely for historical reasons - the game originated here. But in the Olympics, we must compete as the UK. There was and is a fear that this would set a precedent for collapsing the four teams into one UK team. So the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish football authorities didn't want to be part of the team. Ultimately, however, it's a decision for players. This is why there are a couple of Welsh people in the UK team.

People see themselves as they wish. I see myself as British first and Scottish second. But others have totally the opposite view.

2. There are plenty of athletes from those regions. We all compete with Team GB.

3. The UK is unlike any other nation, really. The UK is a nation-state made up of four countries. It isn't a federal system, but it has similarities. There's one UK-wide government. This operates out of London, and is elected by all of the nation. There are also devolved legislatures in some of the constituent countries. Scotland and Northern Ireland both have parliaments with wide-ranging powers. Wales has an Assembly with less extensive powers. England does not have a separate parliament.

4. Queen Elizabeth is the Queen of the entire UK, yes. She's also Queen of 16 other countries too. She isn't English - she's British. Scotland and England did have separate Kings and Queens for centuries. in 1603 the Scottish King became King of England as well. In 1707, the countries merged. The Queen has some power, but never uses it. It's a very British arrangement - we allow her to keep her power as long as she doesn't use it. For example, the Queen must give assent to all laws passed by parliament. But the last time a Monarch refused to do so was in 1608.

true,squigs,cnty-expat,Brightonaut in Berlin,"&gt; Why Team GB? 

The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is often referred to by the name of the Island (Great Britain).  England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are considered the countries that make up the UK.

&gt; The commentators for the soccer game were saying Scotland and Northern Ireland essentially wanted no part of it.

For historic reasons, England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own football associations.  They had various concerns that a GB team would result in the separate national teams being combined for all competitions.  

&gt; Who's responsible for the final decision to do it if two of the countries didn't even want to participate?

Well in this case, the country that *does* want to participate.

&gt; Do people usually see themselves as British or English, Irish..etc. 

Most of us identify by English, Scottish, Welsh or Irish.

&gt; So is there no Scottish, Whales, or Northern Ireland athletes? Do all of them fall under GB?

There are. Except in football.

&gt; WTF is the United Kingdom?

It's the short name of the united Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  

&gt; .Is it like the U.S. where we have state governments that can make separate laws but the Federal Gov't usually has the final say.

That's not quite how the US works...

But it's a little complicated.  

England and Scotland were separate nations entirely until the 16th century.  Wales was itself a separate nation but became part of the same nation much earlier.  As a result, England and Wales have the same legal system, but Scotland has its own.  However, the law is made by central government.

Except that we also have regional assemblies.  These have a certain amount of legislative power in their own country.  

&gt; Finally we have your queen (so weird). Is she the queen of the entire UK?

Yes.  

&gt;  Do the Scots and N. Irish all respect her and see her as royalty?

Well, there's quite a number of republicans in all the countries that don't.  But on the whole, she's accepted as the monarch.  

England and Scotland have shared a monarch since James I of England (James VI of Scotland) was the first king to have a claim to both thrones.  Before that we had separate monarchs.  Since then, because the rules of succession are the same for both countries, both have shared a monarch.

&gt; Is the queen English? 

Yes.

&gt; Does she have any power?

She's a figurehead.  Nominally she has absolute power but there would be a serious problems if she actually used this power, and would presumably result in her being removed from power.

The progression of that illness left me with long-term complications, which the NHS have been completely ill-equiped to handle, and my quality of life has slowly decreased since then. I have a friend in Germany with a very similar problem, and there is an enormous difference in the quality of care. Or to pick another example, [Diabetes care in the NHS seems to be quite poor](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-18032208). And I also have multiple family members who have been treated with complete contempt by GPs, regarding problems that eventually turned out to be serious.

That's not to say that I know what to do to make the system work better, or that any reform should be pursued, no matter how ill thought through, especially if we're going to tend towards an American system. I'm grateful that I didn't actually die. And of course, the majority of people that work within the NHS should be treated with great respect. But equally, we shouldn't be too self-satisfied about the system we have, and we shouldn't stop looking around, and trying to emulate other countries who manage to get better outcomes.

true,Ghwyr,hampshire,Hampshire,"Dear Americans...

I want to take some time to explain something to you, something that some of you seem to have missed in all your rants about the NHS.

Whilst we as Brits usually don't mind some good natured ribbing and secretly tend to laugh along when you poke fun at us and our parochial ways the NHS is different. Take the piss out of our politicians, policy's, culture, TV, music even our Armed Forces as much as you like we don't really mind that much, but having a go at the NHS is an intensely personal insult and guaranteed to make us incredibly angry and I'll tell you why.

The NHS was formed in 1948, it is not just universal healthcare it is a complete “cradle to the grave” healthcare package for everyone. Every UK citizen born in the last 64 years was born under NHS care. Every jab, immunisation, check-up or treatment we have ever had has been administered by the NHS. It is not just our healthcare system, it is the only healthcare system most of us have ever known and it is with us everyday, it is a part of our lives, our culture and our society. You'd be hard pressed to find anyone in the UK who does not know someone who works within the NHS and you'd find it even harder to find anyone who has not been treated or had a family member or loved one treated under the NHS. It is not just our healthcare system, it is a part of our extended family.

Sure it is not perfect, it has it's faults and there is plenty of room for improvement and yes we Brits can be somewhat critical of it sometimes but it is ours. Yes the waiting lists can be a pain (I know I'm on one) but that's because treatment is prioritised by necessity not by wallet size, those who are most in need get treated first the rest of us just have to wait our turn. That is the price we pay for a healthcare system that does not destroy our lives with debt in order to keep us alive. 

The NHS may not give us everything we want, but it gives us everything we need without question, without delay and without bankrupting us. Everyday when we walk past a GP's surgery knowing that we can pop in to speak to a doctor if we need to, or pass by a chemist knowing we can get our medications if needed, or see a hospital knowing our sick and injured are being cared for we know that the NHS is there for us. Every time we see an Ambulance rush past us with its lights flashing and sirens blaring we are reminded that not only is there someone in trouble, but more importantly there is someone there to help them with whatever they need regardless of their circumstances. It is an ever present reassurance that we are cared for.

In America if you can afford it you pay your “for profit” insurance company who in turn pay for your “for profit” hospitals. They make millions and might give you good healthcare... until your insurance runs out, or your illness isn't covered. You seem to think this is “freedom” (and oddly cheaper and more “cost-effective” than the NHS) I'll never understand that. I live in a country that has non-profit universal comprehensive healthcare system that will provide for me, my family and my loved ones whatever we need, whenever we need it, for as long as is needed. You will never understand how liberating it is to live your life knowing that if something goes wrong, be it illness, injury or accident the NHS will be there. That is freedom, living with the absolute certainty that should I fall there will be someone there to pick me up and get me back on my feet no matter what or how long it takes. 

You Americans are free to choose whatever healthcare system you wish, you can call the NHS socialist or left wing or whatever you want. But don't insult it, don't spread lies about it because it is OURS! It is not just an institution, it is not just something we are proud of, it is our family. It brought us and our children into this world, it cared for us when we were sick, helped us when we were injured and when the time comes it will hold our hands as we die. It is a part of our everyday lives whether we realise it or not, it is a part of the very foundations of modern British society (which is why it deserved its spot in the opening ceremony), and we could not, and would not want to exist without it.

Governments come and go, policies and attitudes change, we're born, we grow old and die but the NHS and the ideals it is founded upon remain constant and relevant. For us Brits the NHS is every bit as important, fundamental and as sacred as your constitution.

That's why we Brits get so annoyed when you insult our NHS, and that's why you need to start showing it some fucking respect.

Yes Australia is disappointed, we didn't win, but the strategy they used could have won. 

Rogers attacked, had he reached the breakaway he and O'Grady would have been in a very good position to win.

I doubt team GB would have chased down Froome or Miller if they were in the breakaway.

The GB team should never have let such a strong group get clear. The fact that they let another group get clear says to me that they weren't riding that hard.

Carra still has value in leadership roles and won't be going anywhere.  He will be staying with the club until he moves eventually into and ""ambassador"" role, and later likely some sort of minor coaching role.

true,galenwolf,eng-manchester,Manchester - FOR SCIENCE!,"They kept my mother alive for 10 good years with severe COPD, and made sure when the end came she went without pain. They gave her every medicine, and treatment they could including inhalers that cost £60 a pop.

The only issue I have is a personal one because I lost my mother a few days before she died because they had to put her on powerful meds to kep her pain free.  She had 10% lung capacity in one lung. She was going to start panicking, struggling and end up in unimaginable pain, so the motorised injector they put her on put her in a constant sleep for the last 3 days of her life.  At first it made her breathe slower and she felt ""better"" but then one day she just went, couldn't focus, could barely recognise me and then she went to sleep and never woke up.  It was that or watch my mother suffocate and go into awful pain.  They did their best and must have spent hundred of thousands of pounds over the 10 years to keep her alive with the amount of drugs she was on.

On a seperate note, I had my galbladder removed, and apart from a slight disagreement with two consultants about how to check that no stones had gone into the ducts - which held up the operation - it was straight forward. The surgeons where fantastic, I got in at 7:30am and by 10am I was on the table. I didn't have any complications and I was pretty much pain free, apart from being sore from the brusing.

true,ravniel,num11,,"A lot of very good points there.  I want to give the first one a lot more attention and I don't have time right now, so let me just handle my shorter observations:

&gt; Any action which undermined the view of Tottenham as a team which protects its assets, and caves in to the demands of players without respect to the financial prudence of the decision, nor the ability to field a competitive team, cannot in any form be considered a beneficial position.

Very true, but I think Levy has made his point on this.  I think last summer and this summer concretely established Spurs as a club who will hang on to their best players tenaciously and who will not be bullied on the transfer market; I think you can already see commenters in r/soccer who aren't Spurs fans talking about Levy in hushed tones.  Since the figure Real Madrid *wanted* to pay has been amply quoted if Levy gets even 35 million it'll be considered a coup and our reputation will be fine.  So I would say he should certainly take such an offer now rather than wait until August 31st in the hopes of getting 40.  (And rumors suggest that he has done so, although I've heard *that* one before)  So yes, last summer I'd say Levy had an important message to deliver - but now I think the point has been made and he can afford to compromise *very* slightly.

&gt; Yet it is certainly arguable, that in most cases, these players (given any form of skill equity) are able to contribute almost instantly.

Yes, that's certainly true.  AVB, though, plays with a challenging system and he's a tactically demanding manager.  That's primarily my concern.  Filling the no. 9 role in Pardew's system should be quite straightforward for any good striker; I'm not convinced that's true of AVB's system.  I think his time at Chelsea showed he'll need time to adapt the players to his style of play and I was hoping we'd give him that time.

I still *mostly* think it'll all turn out alright, but I'm nervous.  I've now seen the rumor I mentioned about Ade surfacing a couple other places and if that's a deal we manage to scuttle because we don't think he's worth 10 million to us I'll consider that very bad business indeed.",0,1343611746,null,0,false,0,c5lcmp1,t3_x9pkt,t1_c5lcmp1,t1_c5l2i7f,null,1429503380,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Wouldnt say thats the case at all!

&gt; We've been terribly rude about the likes of Carragher, Adam, Downing and Spearing. They deserve some respect for the amount of effort they have put into the team.

Nobody is questioning their effort and they get our full respect and I know we want ALL our players to fit in to the team and work well together, but sometimes they just dont work and the pieces dont fit.

Spearing and Adam, try hard but they just dont fit in with the teams style of play, they didnt with Kenny and I struggle to think how they'll fit in with the faster more energetic Tika taka system. 

They ARE good players but sadly they are not good enough for us, now that may sound harsh but its a cold truth. There slow and there tackling is questionable, they can produce good passes but they have a horrible habbit of getting out of position.

Carragher technically is sound and he's been through it all but his age has caught up with him, he's no longer got the lungs or pace for 90 and players know this. Think of how quicker players take advantage of John Terry by luring him out of position then using there speed to get around him, heck we did that in our final game of the season, the same can be said and done with Carra. 

Downing may still be good for us but with only 3 places available in mid under Rodgers system and two of them going to Gerrard and Lucas where does downing fit? I know he struggled but were not going to be playing down the wings like we used to were going to be keeping position so I dont know what place a supporting winger has in the team, maybe he'll be the biggest turnaround player?

The movie is basically a (colour!) remake of a Hartnell story from the first (1963) season.",0,1343614118,null,0,1343614350,0,c5ld6qn,t3_xbyby,t1_c5ld6qn,t1_c5l22ut,null,1429503638,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Tony Adam for Arsenal is a prime example of this, his age caught up with him, he lost his pace and players would pull him from his position and run through or around him and If he couldn't catch them he'd bring them down.

John Terry is showing similar signs of this now, think back to the last game of the season when Henderson drew him out and out paced him.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Its still the tika taka system but spain are very good at transitioning between the variations and using each variation to control the current situation. Its hard to explain this because I dont want to get it wrong and do it injustice but I was reading this article by Rafa Benetez about Spains 6 midfielder tactic and it has an interesting point.  

(remember Im generalizing here) 

Rather than having 2 strikers with say a 65% chance of scoring why not play 6 Midfielder who have good scoring records, even if there scoring chance is 40-45% each that averages out to a better rate than having 2 strikers. 

Because you now have 3 mids in the centre and 3 up front using their tactics of keeping the ball they are forced to maintain possession very high up the pitch creating that feel that they are attacking forcing the defenders to hold positions and close down rather than push out.

So when they finally did bring out the strikers, the opposing team were playing so deep in their own half that they failed to realise how much ground they had lost and that by doing so they had increased the strikers chances of scoring maybe 10 or more %. This allowed spain to switch into attacking style and the defence would find that everyball now spain was playing was finding strikers in the box and when you have strikers as good as spain have its hard to miss in the box.

As said I agree with you saying liverpool WILL play their own style and it will be primarily attack orientated but none the less Rodgers system however changed or altered is tika taka rooted.",0,1343617449,null,0,false,0,c5ldzvm,t3_xd698,t1_c5ldzvm,t1_c5ldgq6,null,1429504016,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

**Passing**

+) ball over the top

+) really nice ball over the top, but offside

+) swing possession just outside the box to out left

+) chip pass to the corner

+) cutting pass through the back line of the defense

-) pass to spearing was lazy and a hospital ball... spearing really 
mucked it up though

-) cross/longball to the left was floated and forced. went straight to the defender

-) overlap with Enrique out of bounds

-) pass to cole... another hospital ball

-) longball to cole... forced, unnecessary loss of possession

**Tackles (obviously not his specialty)**

+) had a nice sliding tackle back on D in the box

-) backed out of the tackle avoided collision

-) backed out of the tackle

-) backed out of the tackle

**Movement**

For the most part he creates space and his movement is good. There were multiple times though his positioning was poor or he was caught ball watching.

**Shots**

-) One very poor speculative effort from far out... unnecessary loss of possession

**Other**

-) Very very poor first touch just outside the box and loss of possession

Spin it however you want, just having Matt Smith would make it feel like any other episode, not a 50th anniversary special. Even if we got back Tennant I'd be a bit disappointed in the range of Doctors. For me, the more Doctors the better!

One thing I'd love to see, as well, is bringing in Richard E Grant as the 9th Doctor. I know it won't be a popular opinion around these parts, but if Eccleston is going to do nothing but crap on both the fandom *and* the history of Who, than I say I'd rather not have him around. Yes, he was a good Doctor, a lot of people liked him around here, but at the end of the day he's done nothing but raise a giant middle finger to the role and to the fandom.

I also think it could make for an interesting story. Maybe the Doctor releases the time lock, bringing back the Time Lords...but something's gone wrong. He's changed the circumstances of his 8th regeneration into the 9th too drastically, and caused time to be rewritten. Suddenly, out from McGann's regeneration pops Grant.

I've suggested this before, it much greater detail, and was reached with mixed reviews. Honestly, I think it could work, and could even fuel an interesting story for the 50th anniversary revolving around the idea that something has gone fatally wrong with history, even if it doesn't involve The Doctor undoing the time lock.

2: You could start watching from series 5, which has a new Doctor, new companions, new head writer, and new everything. You do not need to know anything about the show.

3: This is what I would suggest. Start watching from series 1, with the 9th Doctor! It really is a great ride, and I'm sure you would enjoy it.

true,seeQer11,lfc68,,"* **Carragher** - You aren't going to push him out... I do hope that on his own free will he steps down and moves onto a coaching/managerial position within the club

* **Charlie Adam** - He can't pressure and he can't tackle (without giving a penalty or breaking someones leg)... this is the main reason I think he will be sold. He really doesn't fit, despite the fact that I like him and am more supportive of him than most fans. 

* **Spearing** - Don't sell Spearing. It's not that he is inconsistent. I'd say he is actually consistently bad, but why is he bad? He makes some great tackles, provides good cover and movement and even plays some really nice passes. Where he goes wrong is in the composure department.... he completely lacks it. This is why you seem him make so many errant plays and being the DM it really screws the team and stands out. Give him more game time in less important games... keep practicing with him in high pressure drills. If he can learn composure I think he'd be a great backup to Lucas. Big ""if"" though. 

* **Aqua** - I'm tired of this drama story. He never seemed to be 100% into LFC and his agent is an ass. I think he would fit in with the system we are trying to build quite well, but I don't think his personality or mentality seem like the right fit. I say sell him if you can and bring someone hungrier into the squad. Also, I have watched him closely and I think he is an above average player, so I don't think it is a huge loss... plus it would clear some wages. 

* **Cole** - I like him and I want him to do well... but Christ almighty he gets tired fast. Half the time  he has his hands on his hips (first sign a player is exhausted) and is sucking wind. I don't think he has the conditioning yet to be a full time player. I could be wrong. I really don't know what to do about Cole. I don't like his wages, but how are you going to offload him? Plus, Rodgers has past experience with him so I think it's likely he stays. 

* **Sterling** - I'd say he is one of the most exciting youth prospects. He is very raw though and needs to go on loan or get some more game time in lower fixtures. The ability is there, but the decision making and final ball need a lot of work. 

* **Shelvey** - For me he is the most promising youth prospect in the near future. Although he fell off in the Roma game it is pretty clear how much he has grown since last season... and I thought he was impressive last season as well. He has confidence and composure. Very excited to seem him this year. Plus he looks like a badass. 

* **Carroll** - I really want it to work with him. I want him to prove all the haters wrong. I don't know how realistic that is in this new system though. He did make some nice plays where he retained possession or made a nice pass in his ~15min of game time against Spurs. 

* **Downing** - No clue, need to watch him play under Rodgers more to form any kind of opinion.

IF he does want to stay, given his youth and proclivity or predilection towards partying and slacking off, perhaps a captain should take it upon himself to re-enforce the values that make Spurs great ie: individual sacrifice and glory by giving 100%(atleast that is why I love Spurs) and convince him to grow the fuck up and leave his mark on this club. Watching him with Mexico and seeing him play for Spurs, it is like two different players. If he could play the way he does with Mexico the same way with Spurs, he has in his own capacity a penchant for extraordinary creativity and an eye for goal. Given Luka's departure, the creative aspect is very important despite not playing in the same position. Furthermore, given our lack of depth at the striker position we'll need that hunger and ability at other positions. It might sound naive, as given his position and the players who start in that position, he is basically relegated to cup play or 'unimportant' games, but if AVB goes with a 4-3-3, I sincerely hope he finds a spot in the XI.

true,TheEvilScotsman,scottish,Scotland,"I don't know if you're using the term racist a little bit emptily. The United Kingdom is a multi-national state, this sacrifices unity but it is to the Union's credit that the central government has started to appreciate the difference between the nations instead of stamping out whatever is left of their national cultures.

I don't know how things are in Wales so couldn't possibly judge, but there is the feeling in Scotland that we are different in many ways. British culture is often used as a catch word for English culture. I can understand why the Olympic opening ceremony chose to focus on England as the games are hosted in the capital city of England, but largely the word 'British' is seen in Scotland as something not 'Scottish'. Quite silly, I know, Scotland is part (of the geographical expression) of Great Britain, but there does seem a major divergence between the cultures of Scotland and England. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate English culture, some very fine poets, playwrights, movie-makers, musicians, and comedians, but I appreciate it in the way that I might appreciate American culture. It is from a different land, it has differing influences (maybe not the big ones such as ancient philosophy, the Bible, and Shakespeare, but in more recent developments), the result is different.

I don't endorse any hierarchy of cultures, they have inherent values, but I do support recognising and embracing the differences. We don't want a mono-cultural United Kingdom, something that Boyle's ceremony tackled in part but was not an overwhelming motif was the differences that merge together to bring a palatable mix.

Did you maybe mean Sterling? Personally I think Sterling would be better served with a loan spell this season, and/or just a cup/Europa run with occasional league appearances. Bellamy, even though he can't play regularly, is usually a key attacking threat when he plays, something Sterling probably won't be yet despite his potential. Considering our lack of quality options in the wide front 3 at the moment, I'd rather keep Bellamy, even if it means he goes on a free next summer; I think he provides us with more now than we'd get in funds from selling him.

Also, with Dirk and Maxi gone, Bellers is one of the few senior pros left, and you need a few of those; remember how mentally fragile we seemed at times last season?

It's interesting thinking about the opening ceremony in the context of what Danny Boyle has said; I admit, a lot of what I felt was there *was* admittedly, multicultural twoddle, but this is merely an aesthetic facade - Calbian's Dream is one of my favourite passages that Shakespeare had ever written, and I've always felt that Caliban, like Grendel, is very much a misunderstood creature; Just as Grendel in Beowulf is violent as a result of a great deal of pain, Caliban is the way he is as a result of his treatment at the hands of a few men...But I digress.

It's good to look at the Olympics opening ceremony in the context of the Director's vision; I am someone, who as a historian believes that it won't be long until we pass into the mists of memory with nothing but the company of previous Empires to keep our memory company; in a very real way for me, the opening ceremony demonstrates quite beautifully our ability to remind the world of the good (and bad) that we've done and begin to say goodbye in a positive manner.

""I left because of politics. I did not see eye to eye with them. I didn't agree with the way things were being run. I didn't like the culture that had grown up around the series. So I left, I felt, over a principle.""

Later: “You know, it’s easy to find a job when you’ve got no morals, you’ve got nothing to be compromised, you can go, ‘Yeah, yeah. That doesn’t matter. That director can bully that prop man and I won’t say anything about it’. But then when that director comes to you and says ‘I think you should play it like this’ you’ve surely got to go ‘How can I respect you, when you behave like that?’""

Based on that, I think, quite far from taking the role lightly, he *epitomized* the Doctor, making a big stand for what he thought was right.

In general Time in the whoniverse is in flux.  History changes all the time, and while you may not like, may prefer zombies don't take over 1860s Cardiff, its entirely possible it could happen.

However, are two situations when you can't change time without risking some damage to the universe.  They are:

1)Actions that create a paradox.  (This is mainly the issue with Rose's Dad, but the odds of something breaking there increased because the Doctor and Rose being there on multiple occasions)

2)The Doctor Says So.  The show refers to these as Fixed Points in Time.  Only the Doctor(or a sufficiently advanced time traveler such as certain Daleks) can tell you when these moments are, so we as an audience need to take his word for it.  

It is a ""just a TV show"" kinda thing, but I feel like they've done as a good a job of rationalizing as is possible.

To take that attempt rationalization a step farther:

Whether or not something is a Fixed Point in Time only seems partly related to consequences of it being changed.   Trying to change what happens on Bowie Base One is very dangerous, but destroying the whole human race in an alien invasion 50 years prior to that, is fine:the universe will continue on unfazed, even though that will also change the future just as much(and more).  I've decided to think of it like this: that there are some some moments in time that are more brittle(less wibbly wobbly if you prefer) than others.  

The events surrounding Family of Blood were not near a fixed a point.  The universe recovered (maybe with a squishy sound) as it filled in the space left by those people and other possibilities became actual.",0,1343625870,null,0,1343679072,0,c5lfywq,t3_xdb0x,t1_c5lfywq,t3_xdb0x,null,1429505092,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

You go ""to"" a place, not ""in"" it.  
Your first sentence is long, so I broke it into two and rearranged them put ideas that belong together in the same sentence.  
""In the very deep""  is usually expressed as ""deep down inside"", but there's no real reason for it other than convention.  
""we hope he came"" doesn't work since ""came"" is past tense. We don't hope for something in the past, we hope for something in the future.  
I also added a subject, ""I"", since right now you don't really have one and while you can imply a subject (eg, ""Go away"" implies ""YOU go away""), it is simpler if you just state it.

That being said, there are a couple of ways to deal with the problem you've presented:

* The first incarnation grows and ages in a similar (albeit slower) manner to humans and other organisms. Regeneration suspends the aging process. (This would be consistent with fan theories that cope with the 1st Doctor only having one heart -- roughly, that everything changes after the first regeneration.)
* In **Lungbarrow** (a 7th Doctor novel), it is stated that [spoiler](#s ""Time Lords are not *born*, but rather are *woven* in genetic looms."")

The thing is, we see a number of times throughout his many incarnations where decades or even millennia pass for the Doctor (see: Day of the Astronaut) with virtually no apparent physical aging.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"I don't quite have the time right now to go digging around interviews, although I will provide them later if you want, but he's also consistently talked about how he has no intentions of going back regardless of who is in charge, or what the working conditions are. He's also said things like you never drink from the same well twice, and a general air of 'I'm better than that show'.

And the thing is, if it were any other role, all this would be fine, including the stuff you cited. If people wanted him to recognize his role on, say Heroes, and he decided not to, then fine. He was on it for no more than three or four episodes, and had a minor role of a character that never existed before he played it.

The problem I have with him is he's turning his back on a fanbase for a character that is 50 years in the making. Even if he had issues, his are pennies compared to other actors that have played the role. Talk to Colin Baker who got fired before he even got the chance to regenerate, McCoy who had the show ripped out from under him during the 'hiatus', or McGann who literally has never gotten a phone call back from the BBC after the filming was complete on the 1996 movie.

They've all had bad experiences with the production as well as the BBC, but ya know what? They are all super affectionate towards the fan base, and are even willing to reprise their roles for the sake of the fans. They don't take their frustrations out on the people that love the character so much. *That* I have respect for, because they don't punish such a huge fan base for something the fans had no part of.

And, like I said, Eccleston has made it clear in other interviews as well that he just wants to distance himself from the role. He's even said before that he never bothered to see just what kind of following Doctor Who had, and I think that played a large part in his decision as well. I mean, when you don't want to be typecasted, jump into a role, and then realize only after that you didn't do your research on just how big a following the role has, I can see why he wanted out. And I'm pretty sure he wanted out pretty early as well, as I saw an interview with David in which he was surprised that he was being offered the part, because the first season had just begun and he didn't realize Eccleston would leave by the end at that point.",0,1343629538,null,0,false,0,c5lgnxq,t3_xd5sk,t1_c5lgnxq,t1_c5lfx4q,null,1429505424,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

At the beginning he's very insecure. He's been in a relationship with a girl that has never overly shown her affection for him, and will even fail to admit that they're going out together. Not to mention growing up being forced to dress up as the raggedy Doctor by Amy. When we first meet him he has such a small personality, and he can't even speak up to the head Doctor when she's putting him down for pointing out something that is happening with the patients.

Over the course of his journeys with The Doctor, he becomes so much more, and grows into Rory the Roman. Or, as some call him, Rory the badass.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"I have to respectfully disagree. What I love with Moffat's characters/writing is you can jump back to the beginning and actually see the progress that was made. After watching A Good Man Goes to War you can watch The Eleventh Hour and say,""Wow...Amy, Rory, and even The Doctor really have changed/grown up since the beginning of their journey!"" It's just apparent in the acting as well as the writing.

In the RTD era the characters felt much more flat, in this regard. If you did the same thing, it never felt like you could see the actual change that had taken place. RTD had much more change 'on paper' as it were. Take Martha, for example. She eventually grew into her own and realized she had to leave The Doctor because he didn't care about her as much as she cared about him, fine. However, going back to the beginning of her character, you can't really look at her and say,""Yeah, there's a difference in this Martha, and the one that was able to stand up for herself and tell The Doctor off."" At least for me, she still *feels* the same, both through her acting as well as her writing.

I think the only one I could confidently say I saw that kind of change in was Mickey, but it's hard saying that it wasn't in part due to the fact that he starts off largely as a caricature, sniveling at Rose's side.

As I grew up through the seventies, he would always tell us kids that we had to support Chelsea, and when we were bought some generic tabletop football game, with teams in red and blue colours, quite naturally it was Chelsea versus Liverpool. Unfortunately being the youngest, I usually ended up playing as Liverpool.

He took me to my first match, Chelsea versus - yes - Liverpool, in the early eighties. Sat in the East Upper.

Fell out of love with football over the years, then regained my love just when Hoddle took over. Season ticket holder in MHL for over 10 years now, some euro away trips (teargassed in Marseille? Yep!) and some fantastic memories (Zola cuddling my baby daughter? Yep!)...

I hope I don't have to look back at this time as our golden age.....

What? 

We're discussing the efficiency of the NHS. You stated:

&gt;the NHS is not efficient, it doesn't have to be so never will be.

I provided evidence that the NHS is in fact one of the most efficient healthcare systems in the world. 

Do you have any evidence to refute my statement or are you going to attempt to insult my intelligence again? If the latter, I'm not even going to bother engaging you in further dialogue as *you* don't seem to understand the basics of debate.

&gt;no, the US system is not a free-market, please look it up.

You didn't say free-market. You said a competing market;

&gt;a competing market would bring better, more affordable care and be a freer, fairer system.

I'm not going to argue with you but I'm curious how you would deal with ....

How many train companies can leave from the same station, to the same destination, at the same time for a consumer to truly have a choice?

How many roads would have to be built for a consumer to have real choice over which road they decide to use on a certain day because there's a special offer?

How many water reservoirs would have to be built for a consumer to have real choice over where they get their water from?

Mail seems like a good candidate for privatisation, though. More than one company can deliver a letter to the same address at exactly the same time and you could have real choice. But even with mail there's a problem. These companies would cherry pick their routes and people in hard to reach places would suffer with lower service and higher prices - so no real choice for them.

Privatisation can not be done fairly in many situations. Current privatisation of the trains leaves passengers with zero choice. These companies have a monopoly on the lines for a fixed term. Zero choice for the consumer. 

You are searching for Utopia and it doesn't exist. You want to live in this pure world where even corporations have your best interests at heart while trying to make a profit and getting along lovingly with other competitors.

I wish you luck in trying to find Utopia and in the mean time, while you're getting very, very pissed off while using these socialist services, I hope you don't do any damage to anyone or yourself with your anger.

I want to live in an imperfect socialist world which does a better job of creating a fairer society than your dream of a competitive Utopia.

You can have the last word.

While Fulham or QPR is the geographical 'local derby', it's pretty friendly as both teams competed in different levels of competition for so long, with a few obvious exceptions. Both will ramp up in intensity as Fulham are an improving force (at least I'd say so) and QPR... Well, the less said about QPR the better at the moment, but see you at the bridge Anton, bring ear plugs

I think Millwall and all their fans can go fuck themselves, disgraceful bunch of thugs. I've had less than friendly welcomes at the Den, but we haven't played them for so long (15 years or more?) the rivalry is much less fierce than before. Other long term Chelsea fans would hate Leeds or West Ham more, I reserve a special hatred for the delightful bunch of skin heads in Millwall shirts who threw a Millwall Brick at 7 year old me. Cunts. Football Factory is a good film that has the Chelsea-Millwall firm rivalry at it's heart, download the subtitled version if you're not English

We have strong rivalries with Man Utd and Liverpool because of how many times we've played them in recent years. You have Evra claiming racism against our steward, Rio 'Duck Face' Ferdinand kicking one of our female ground staff, numerous player confrontations during the games, especially prominent during the CL Final in 2008

Who doesn't hate Spurs? Not much more to add there, though I'm looking forward to RDM's Chelsea going in dry on AVB's Spurs. Arsenal have been in our shadow for a few years now though that 5-3 hurt bad, I find Arsenal fans to be more bark than bite though, so they'll pipe down once we give them another season of schooling

Leeds is an old school rivalry. We were both successful around the same time (late 60s, early 70s) so there were some really intense, dirty matches around that time. Plus Leeds tend to embody the banjo playing, bitter drinking, country boy slack-jawed yokel image that is the antithesis of our city boys. Yorkshire Grit vs. Cockney Flash as they like to call it. Mine Boys vs. Wide Boys is the term I prefer

You *could* make a case for unlawful arrest, but you need to be able to show that the officer who arrested you could not, or should not have had reasonable suspicion. If you were part of a group where other people have been charged, this is basically impossible. 

Kettling, well that's bad, but it's a different issue. CS spray was only used once, we don't really have enough details on that, but there was 'a tussle with police' so basically, there is no case there.

&gt;After being charged, Simon lost both professional and political positions, despite the fact that no pornography was found on any of his work computers. In fact, no pornography was found on Simon's home computers either.
Instead, the police had to “interrogate” Simon's personal email account (server) in order to discover a few images they deemed questionable. This included an image of a man wearing a gas mask. Their expert stated that this was likely to cause serious harm, even death by asphyxiation: despite being a piece of equipment designed to assist breathing. This charge was eventually dropped.
Unfortunately, by performing the “interrogation” of Simon's email account in the fashion they did, the police contaminated the only source of evidence; making it impossible to identify whether images attached to emails had in fact been opened and viewed.

But there is something Omega will learn when he finds out the Doctor's name. The Doctor is [The Other](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Other). Omega and the Doctor then stop Rassilon and the rest of the evil in the Time War (with the help of some human companions, some Time Lords maybe as well, possibly a Roman). The Doctor then at the very end is reunited with Patience who reveals that Susan is the new companion. The Doctor now has some of his family back and Time Lord civilization is restored to the universe.

The best that can be said about the segment, on the information that I'm aware of, is that it was conceived as a broad reflection on mortality to provide a more reflective section and an opportunity for participants and spectators to remember absent friends and loved ones. Of course in that context some people may think of 7/7 victims, but that doesn't make it a 7/7 tribute. It inherited the '7/7 tribute' label because that was simply the most effective way for people to castigate NBC's editorial decisions and from there it snowballed to the point where people are now smugly posting their haughty complaint emails based on a fundamentally flawed idea of what the segment was about in the first place. Not only is that perpetuating a myth, it's also something of an insult to the organisers, choreographers and performers that people are pinning their opposition to the performance being cut from broadcast not on respect for their efforts but on a misguided notion of what it was intended to represent.",0,1343655578,null,0,false,0,c5ljkiy,t3_xba8l,t1_c5ljkiy,t1_c5lj9hh,null,1429506787,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

What about the likes of Mascherano, Lucas and Busquets? They operate primarily defensively looking to regain and retain possession feeding the ball to team mates through quick short passes often making thoses passes horizontally across the pitch or back to their defence.

Well rounded players in any role on the pitch are a blessing to have but class well rounded players are also a rare commodity so the challenge then becomes to employ those players you do have in roles which play to their strengths and help negate their weaknesses.

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"To be honest, I'm not sure Adam will benefit from Lucas' return this time around, simply because of the differences in style between Kenny and Rodgers. Let me explain.

Under Kenny, there was never a cohesive tactical plan - we were a little bit like Spurs, where Kenny put the players on the pitch with the freedom to play their own style, hoping that the team he'd put together had players whose styles would allow them to effectively combine. When this worked, it was great (Suarez-Kuyt-Maxi, Lucas-Adam), when it didn't it was awful (Enrique &amp; Downing getting in each other's way on the left, neither of them providing for Carroll, Carroll &amp; Suarez failing, Henderson on the right). But the point is, it was a player-based, not system-based tactic, and thus the absence/impact of any given player would be greater.

In this setup, Lucas became the ultimate water-carrier; with Downing high up one flank, Henderson no more than average defensively and Adam way below average defensively, Lucas did significant defensive duties for pretty much the entire midfield. And we all know what happened when he got injured.

Under Rodgers, it's very much system-first; obviously it's useless if the players don't fit, but what it does mean is that swapping one player for another doesn't have the same degree of influence as it would under Kenny. But the other side of this is that every person in the system has to abide by the system - in this case, know when to retain possession and when to aim for penetration, and pressing off the ball. Decision-making and defensive duties are certainly not strengths of Charlie's, and in a system-based approach where everyone needs to contribute equally for success, it doesn't matter if he's accompanied by Lucas **and** Mascherano, they'll have their areas of the pitch to press and he'll have his, and if he doesn't do it then it ends in tears.",0,1343659633,null,0,false,0,c5lkbsr,t3_xdz1n,t1_c5lkbsr,t1_c5lj8f0,null,1429507148,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

for me man utd and liverpool climb above teams like millwall and leeds because of recent history in the premier league against utd and cup competitions against liverpool, though if leeds and/or millwall can ever manage to get promoted that could change. 

qpr is heating up because of everything that happened last year and west ham have always been more bothered about playing us than we have about them. fulham - chelsea is probably the friendliest derby in english football.

for me our two most bitter rivals will always be arsenal and then spurs. both clubs have an over-inflated sense of self-righteousness, and generally seem to think they're the only two teams in london. 

arsenal beat the shit out of us for so many years, that since the tables have turned with us consistently winning or challenging for honours, and them spectacularly failing to win anything since 2005, it has been the sweetest of sweet sweet vengeance. 3-5 at the bridge was appalling, and i would love nothing more than to do the double on them this year.

spurs have an obnoxiously inflated sense of superiority regarding the quality/caliber of their support in the same way that arsenal have an obnoxiously inflated sense of superiority regarding the caliber/quality of their footballing. with them bringing in avb, and the fact that he can't seem to stop himself mentioning us in the press, those derbies should be especially nice and spiky this season.

If I go to a cash-based one, it works this way, because I am a customer. I don't want to someone else decide what is good for me. I expect literally _care_, not just treatment - care meaning alleviating all the stress and fears from having a problem etc. Cash-based ones understand it because they life off the market.

And so is the Wedding March and any number of other traditional songs. It's not all about you, and isn't why you sing or play them.

There is, it's called private health insurance. Many providers exist in the UK, BUPA is one of the best known. It's an employment benefit offered by lots of companies generally for positions requiring a degree.

I'm not a communist, not by a long shot. I can understand that someone from Eastern Europe would be particularly sensitive to any sniff of statism; I share that. I fight hard with my money, with my pen and with my vote against almost every instance where the state encroaches on the rights of the individual. In the case of the NHS, though, I draw a line. The fundamental good of cradle-to-grave, free-at-the-point-of-access, universal healthcare far outweighs the principle of state non-interference. The problems with the NHS stem from a relatively recent culture of independent, 'civilian' management - bureaucrats, in other words.

Proposals for government monitoring of all email, chat and web activity. The national DNA database. Insurance-mandated GPS car tracking. RIPA. The terrifying provisions of the Terrorism Act.

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"There is only Juan answer. 

In most teams and especially in our formation we do not need our central player to charge at defenders himself. We need someone with an incredible touch and the ability to get out of difficult positions and make the very important last couple of passes whether it is to the wings or a through ball.

Hazard is the kind of player who likes to run at defenders and beat them. He can beat players but his style of beating players is only successful when he is barging towards goal. Mata is the kind of player who can hold the ball in one spot, save himself from 3-4 challenges and still make that perfect pass to a forward/winger. The reason Mata struggled so much at the end of last season is because he needs players like him around him to function. If Mata has a player like Marin, Hazard, Silva besides him who can interchange with him and take the pressure off him then he will thrive. Chelsea played all the players who were not compatible with Mata near the end of last season. The only one who could connect to Mata was Lampard while even Ramires is not very good at linking up and doing combined trickery with Mata because his touch sometimes lets him down. When Mata will have a player like him who will take the pressure off him and perfectly accept his pass and give him a perfectly placed ball then he will be able to return to a better form than we have ever seen. You cannot take out a Barcelona midfielder, place him in your midfield and expect him to do miracles. He needs the rest of his midfield to do the same job or he will be lost on the pitch. That was the same problem Mata was facing yet still he managed to be our player of the season. Not one of Meireles, Essien, Mikel, Malouda, Kalou, Sturridge can link up with Mata. Some of them are too slow, some take too many touches on the ball, some don't have enough confidence and technique to have a good touch or pass the ball back, some don't even bother passing the ball back. What Mata needs is Romeu, Marin, Hazard, Lampard, Ramires (on his top form) and an evolved Piazon/Josh playing with him. This is further backed by Di Matteo trying to build up this new set of players who can all work together better and is trying to get rid of the others. Torres also needs this midfield to work.

At Barcelona Hazard would play central but at most other clubs he will play in the Ramires/Sturridge/Zhirkov/Mata positions at the same time. He will interchange with Mata but overall Mata is going to be the central player who will knit every move.

If you remember, back when the bid was made for the London games, the British Olympic Association tried to amend their Olympic contract to include Northern Ireland. The Irish Olympic Committee flipped their shit, and the Irish guy on the International Olympic Committee said ""LOLNO, the Northern Irish athletes are not just yours Britain, Ireland claims them too"".

The best bit is that none of these opinions is wrong; they are all present and all welcome.

At least some of them are OK with breaking the law.

&gt; The police had issued a Section 12 Order banning cyclists from going north of the River Thames, police were blocking the bridges creating huge traffic jams, cyclists were attempting to ride freely where they liked and being met with police violence.

So, the police have an order under [Section 12 of the Public Order act](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/12), and a bunch of cyclists decide it's OK for them to break the law.  

They are then surprised when the Police decide to arrest them, and whilst under arrest are not allowed access to their phones, have to wait to go to the toilet and don't get a free meal like they are *fucking under arrest or something*.

Really?  It's OK for them to break the rules when it suits them, but not OK for the Police to take action on one of the busiest nights that London is likely to see this decade?
