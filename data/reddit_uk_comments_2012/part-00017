Paxo analysed this phenomenon in depth in his excellent book, ""The Political Animal"".

But going up from 15% to 33% in 10 years is a very large jump, even with an extra approximately 8 million people now filling out the census on behalf of themselves.

I've just done some research and [this data from the 2001 census](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/02/20757/53570) (albeit just in Scotland - it was the best data set I could find) suggested that just under 35% of 0 - 15 year olds had no religion in the census (although this is filled in by parents), compared to just over 35% of 16 - 29 and between 5% and 10% of pensioners.  So whilst it does back up the claim that it will have gone up, I don't think it backs up the claim that it would have gone up to 33%.  Note also that those in Scotland were much more likely to have no religion than the UK as a whole (27.6% compared to 15.5%).

true,[deleted],null,null,"Actually having thought about that, specialisation only becomes possible through cooperation so the former should only be a secondary concern. Once a certain threshold of specialisation is reached, instability is introduced through monopoly like structures and artificial (but very real) scarcity. Single points of failure whether it be striking workers, imported oil, too big to fail banks, a concentrated media or political class, give rise to situations where certain groups have enormous leverage over society just because there is no alternative. To compound matters it only takes corruption of a few to capture whole systems, and to pervert current politics only a handful of lobbyists greasing a handful of palms is needed. Distribute democracy much wider and the task becomes increasingly difficult and a robustness is designed in. As a result I am going to cast this assertion out with the other myths of capitalism: specialism can introduce inefficiencies through conflict and resistance to change.

There is an interesting counter however: specialisation could be a possible first principle with enough coercion. The violence of slavery in 'modern' countries is now mostly frowned upon (although with the increasing use of workfare perhaps this might not be the case), so subtler means were invented. Specifically this would be debt-based privately owned currencies. But what happens when this means of coercion breaks down? As we have seen from history, whether it be Thatcher's strike breakers, or the present day beat-downs of economic protest across the world, violence is always a keen substitute. Again I reject the assertion.

Basically I think that the limit on outcomes in state education is about whether kids want to be there.  If there are 4-5 kids in a class who really don't want to be there, they prevent all progress and the whole class gets a grade lower than they would otherwise.

Faith Schools are easy to get into if you want to, you just go to church for a year before applying.  That is what my parents did with me.  We were not christians.  But it meant that I was among other similar kids - kids whose parents wanted them to learn.  If I had gone to the local sink comprehensive I would have sat there waiting to learn as others disrupted things (I live in a pretty shitty area).

So for me, that limit on access got me a better education.  I don't necessarily think that it needs to be a ""faith"" school.  I think any system where you forced parents to get up early on their day off, drag their 10 year old out and attend for an hour would work.  I would support an Atheist ""faith"" school as long as the same applied (maybe science and philosophy 101 for kids and parents 10-11 on Sundays).

That education got me to do A-levels and gave me space to deal with some issues I had.  That got me to uni and now I am 27 and on 35k plus bonus.  I would have gone no where without that.

Grammar schools should do the same but ~90% of grammar places go to kids who have been tutored to pass the entry exam.  So they are really becoming just a cheaper alternative to private education.  They would not have helped me as my family were to poor and let's face it, smart and unprepared kids loses to kids who are medium intelligence but have been drilled in the exam weekly for a year.

So really I am interested in any system that sets according to ""interest"".  Faith schools are one way to do that.

I would also add that my school got a large interest free loan from the CofE for some facilities and while ""corporate sponsorship"" has its draw backs this is really nothing different to what Academies are doing (letting private groups or individuals set the ethos in exchange for some capital investment).",0,1329224071,null,0,false,0,c3r3a6v,t3_potkr,t1_c3r3a6v,t1_c3r37k6,null,1428351553,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,widgetas,null,null,"I had a brain fart when I asked and really didn't comprehend what you were meaning by ""social mobility"". It makes sense now.

Everything you outline about faith schools is true, as it goes. But there's one small  problem with it all and with what you describe: It's not fair. As you've pointed out, parents 'have' to attend worship in many cases, but that's not all. Faith schools can still select or, more importantly, *not* select pupils.

One of the arguments often given for faith schools it that they are higher achievers than other schools. I believe it's 2/3 of all 'top' UK schools are faith schools (not bad for only 1/3 of all schools being faith run). But when you have a selection process in the first place, you're going to be doing better from the off. For one thing, a child with parents who care enough about its education to go to church every week are much more likely to take an active interest in its schooling/homework/exams in the future. 

However to begin to show how their system might not be fair, you have to take into consideration the parents who aren't able to make it to church. Take two kids who are the same as you were ability-wise. Dave have two parents able to get to church etc. and get brownie points. Meanwhile, Billy next door is being raised by a single mum (for whatever reason) who has to hold down a job that requires long working hours *and* she has to take care of an aging relative. When will Billy's mum have time to go to church and tick the appropriate boxes to get her kid into the faith school?

Faith schools can also be rather discriminatory when it comes to staff too. In fact the loophole that allows faith schools to sack/not hire teachers on the basis of their (non)religion or sexuality was [recently raised in the Lords, as an amendment was tabled to close it](http://www.secularism.org.uk/teacher-discrimination-challenge.html). I believe it was the Bishop of Oxford who said (paraphrased): ""My goodness me, I can't see a faith school ever doing something as terrible as that."" Then he opposed the amendment. Smart guy.

Another point to note is that faith schools are divisive and, for all the claims to the contrary made by various MPs and religious leaders, do not foster social cohesion. How can it? When you have a school bent to one particular religion to a group of kids where a large fraction is guaranteed not to have a family in that religion (perhaps not applicable to Muslim schools), how can that bring families together particularly in a wider setting? Particularly in areas with for example a large Muslim population. If they have their own school then how are there kids going to interact with the more common British child who go to the Christian faith school down the road?

In terms of connecting together the outcome and the explanation, I don't think it is unfair to say that immigrants to France are uncomfortable with being told to abandon their culture and take up a unified secular French identity in one fell swoop, and that underlies at least some of the tensions in French society. The traditional British attitude, which is to allow people to behave as they like so long as they don't harm others, strikes me as much more realistic and tolerant. There is a natural process of integration, as children of immigrants, and children's children grow up in the new society, and it does no one any good to hector them in the meantime.

Presumably you mean that dirigism leads to unemployment, which leads to tensions. I'm sure that is a contributory factor, along with the fact that the French empire fell apart in much more acrimonious circumstances than the British.

By getting back into the squad, he is likely to restore faith other clubs need to meet City's asking price. This is not about him coming back and knuckling down for the rest of his career, this is about him taking a few months to get to where he wants to go.

So he'll probably carry on insisting in foreign language interviews that this is the worst city in the World, he'll apologise (""if he has to"" as one interview put it), but not really mean it, and he'll begrudgingly do what Mancini tells him until the end of the season.

Given a chance to play, he'll work hard to try and prove he's worth a nice big transfer fee. Really hard. We'll be impressed, seriously.

In the process he'll pick up 5-6+ much-needed goals - maybe more - and hopefully help us get the title. Then in the Summer he'll disappear off to Corinthians, or perhaps Milan one way or the other.

It works for City at a management level because despite us getting a more secure home-run to the title (fingers crossed!), it also means we get the transfer fee which is going to help in terms of FIFA Fair Play for our own ambitions this Summer.

I am of course prepared to be over-joyed and amazed and take all this back if in fact he knuckles down and scores 20 goals/season for the next 5 years for us, helping to take us on to consecutive EPL and Champions League titles, but come on: this is a business move, and nothing more or less.",0,1329231688,null,0,false,0,c3r46ln,t3_pnlwp,t1_c3r46ln,t3_pnlwp,null,1428351973,4,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,4

true,thoughtspasm,null,null,"&gt; i'm quite curious as to what people of the UK think of us regarding different subjects. Are you fond of American tourists? What do you think of our president or our culture? Anything really.

All the American visitors (in other countries as well as the UK) I've met have been friendly and polite.  I dislike much of the American culture - gun ownership, celebrity, Hollywood etc but this is personal taste.

&gt;Some things that I am curious about regarding the U.K... How ethnically diverse is it? I've never left my country, but still, even leaving my state of New Jersey and going to someplace else like Texas has HUGE differences and opinions.

The UK has been deliberately diversified.  Not everyone likes this.

&gt; Do you deal with any racism? I've always wondered what people in different countries feel about different races. My country is unique in the fact that we have so many different races, but I imagine every country has racism in some form.

Yes, like everywhere, there is racism.  One of the biggest problems we have though it reducing cultural or religious differences into race arguments.

&gt; What is politics like in the UK? I know David Cameron has only become the PM recently, and has a more conservative or republican view than say Tony Blair, but i wondered if Cameron would seem very left leaning compared to the extreme views that some Americans can have. Also, what are the major parties like in the government? Since i'm studying government now, this interests me greatly, and i wonder how different it is from our two party system.

In our last general election, the leader of the weakest party (ie the one with the least votes) ended up deciding which of the two major parties to form a coalition with.  Our votes were effectively rendered useless.

&gt; What is school like? I've always wondered this, but I am completely ignorant to how your school system works. I'm sure it is much similar (and probably better) than the US, but how exactly does it work? When do kids get off, or when do they go to school? What is required in school?

This part of the abstract:

&gt; We suggest that the previous perception of an age-related risk increase of accidents per distance driven arises from a failure to control for low mileage bias at all ages.

Is interesting.  The conclusion, stated in clear English, is that a 40 year old driver and a 70 year old driver each driving 10 Mm/year have a similar accident risk.  Given that older people drive less due to not commuting, there will be a clear group of higher risk individuals who happen to be old.  One can equally well state that drivers in their 30s who drive little are equally risky.  In reality I suspect people observe that the low distance 30-40 yr group is comparatively small as a % of their age group, so a cognitive bias arises against the older drivers, even though it's not actually a function of age.

Angel's also bother me because I don't understand how stone is such an effective defense. I'd like to see someone go after one of them with a jackhammer. I presume they're either invincable stone that can't be destroyed, or else you could just shatter them. And invincable stone seems seems kinda unlikely to me.

So if they can be broken, then the question is whether breaking the stone form would be harmful. I would assume it would be, for two reasons. First, decay of the actual angels was represented in physical decay of the angels in the most recent pair of episodes, so that seems as though there is so some connection between the two forms. Second, if there were no connection, I would expect the angels to all take turns throwing themselves off cliffs so that they'd eventually be reduced to a pebble, thus making them much more difficult to detect.

I can think of reasons why this wouldn't apply, like them regenerating a new stone form each sighting even if the old were broken, but I'm somewhat suprised that noone has even tried to pull out a grenade launcher and see what happens yet.",0,1329236824,null,0,false,0,c3r51ln,t3_pm9pz,t1_c3r51ln,t1_c3r2yrc,null,1428352378,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Yes, the production values are awful, many episodes are missing, but it will give you valuable insight into the character of The Doctor; how he starts out as an exile and becomes a hero.

You'll see The Doctor stumble and fall in the early days, becoming slowly more sure of his place in the universe at large until he gives a terrific speech at the end of The War Machines whilst on trial for his life.

I think unions serve a useful counterweight against people on the top of the pile hogging too big a slice of the pie. The problem is when the people on top are effectively politicians who might see themselves hoofed out of office if people can't catch a train or bus one day too often, which is what enables the relatively generous salaries tube drivers enjoy.

It's tricky to think of a solution to that since elsewhere in the country, privatisation of public transport hasn't really led to much greater competition, just local monopolies. I'm not sure if this is down to one company securing a contract for an entire region, or more just simple behavioural economics at work - people may have their principles against being exploited by big transit companies like First but principles take a back seat when you're waiting for your bus, it's pissing it down and you don't want to wait the extra fifteen minutes for the much-less-frequent competitor (Scraggs, in my area), so you grit your teeth and cough up to the top dog. A natural monopoly follows from this.

2. The State Dept. has varied its viewpoints on everything, plus it's a mix of ideology and national interest as the United States and much of the western world is against China's ideals. Not to mention Hong Kong would find it difficult to adapt to such a cultural shift.

3. Taiwan is once more an ideological disagreement with the Chinese coupled with national interest.

I wasn't saying that the Americans don't adhere to national interest but there's always a clear ideological undertone like with any great power.

Also, the State Dept had a recent Gaffe in which Hillary Clinton herself called the islands Las Malvinas. Which was a clear slap in the face and an attempt to cosy up with Latin America as they know the British would be pissed off but nothing more.

We were limited by my cameras ability to only hold 20 minutes of footage and we didn't come up with any orchestrated plan, so I think we did pretty well for what we had to work with.  Three kids were wandering around trying to watch what we were doing so we invited them to be in the video, which they accepted excitedly.  Next time we'll go for a tripod (there was lots of tripping involved) and I also learned that while recording my camera cuts off the top and bottom of the frame, so we lose some foreheads occasionally.

This song was recorded meticulously in the lead singer's bedroom using a rockband microphone and garage band.

Check out the video, if you like the music you can find The Internauts on [facebook](http://facebook.com/internauts) - make sure to add them so you can find out when they have shows around town, and they'll soon be putting up a fresh batch of studio recordings.

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"The first time a music lawyer explained a contract to me ( 20 years ago ) I had absolutely no fucking idea what any of it meant, I'm a little more wise to this business nowadays, but at the time I just saw the pound notes and I signed it. Luckily for me it wasn't all that bad, but these contracts are horrendous, I mean there's even a clause saying you can't in any way badmouth Cowell or any of his production crew if it goes tits up for you.  

For example if they say you win a £1million recording contract, what that actually means is that if you reach say the sixth album then the progressive advances will eventually add up to £1million. 

OK in reality that means: 

£50,000 advance for the first album 

£100,000 for the second

£150,000 for the third

£200,000 for the fourth  

£250,000 for the fifth 

And £250,000 for the sixth

= £1million in advances. 



The thing is though you never get to the second album so in reality that £1million contract is actually worth £50,000 to you minus production costs, minus engineering costs, minus styling costs and all the other shit they throw your way, so after your initial £50,000 advance you are now in the red and your career is basically over.  You never have to pay back this money, but that's **all** you're going to get from this contract. 

And that's about the size of that. 



It's such an easy trap when you're blind to this industry and all you're seeing is ""fame""

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

And even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"The British fleet moved into the area and launched airstrikes against the Islands in an attempt to draw the Argentine airforce out to meet them. These failed, however the Argentinian forces became convinced the Brits were in the process of landing troops. 

To take advantage of this moment of vulnerability they launched two Naval groups; the first main force consisted of their carrier and escorts, which was to get in close and strike at the British fleet. This sailed around the north of the islands.

The second group consisted of the Belgrano; an old WW2 era cruiser plus escorts, and was to sail around the south of the island. It's mission wasn't to engage the British fleet; no one thought it would stand a chance. Rather it was there as a blocking force to prevent the British from fleeing south from the carrier attack, and push them back out into the Atlantic.

Soon after the plan was put into action the Argentine navy realised their intel was wrong, and the Brits were not landing troops but waiting for them. Both groups were ordered to turn around and started to retreat back to their holding positions.

The Britis on the other hand were flapping a fair bit. They knew the Argentine pincer movement was coming, but the other sub in the area assigned to find and sink the Argentine carrier had not yet made contact with it. With the HMS Conquer tailing the Belgrano, the Admirals asked Downing Street for permission to change the rules of engagement and strike a target outside the 200km exclusion zone.

This was given, but by which time the ARA Belgrano and escorts had turned about and were heading back towards their staging area. Although the HMS Conquer relayed this information back to the UK, it is not believed the Admirals ever let the politicians know of the change. The Belgrano was then sunk, and the rest of the Argentine navy returned to port in shock and did not emerge for the remainder of the war. The pincer threat against the British fleet was over, although they still suffered heavily over the following weeks from air attacks.

The sinking of the Belgrano was undoubtedly not a war crime; it was a belligerent warship which almost certainly would have returned to action against the British fleet. But questions of the judgement of those giving the orders are still valid, as any circumstance in a war between us and another country where those making the decisions are not in full possession of the facts should raise concerns.",0,1329262331,null,0,false,0,c3ra0lu,t3_poxkw,t1_c3ra0lu,t1_c3r8sn6,null,1428354780,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

true,tamuowen,lfc68,null,"I initially thought Downing was going to be a great buy for us, even though I was worried about his high price. Stats showed that he had done a fantastic job of creating chances and had a very accurate cross. We've lacked a true winger for a while and desperately need someone who can widen the field and give Carroll good service. Downing has done neither in his time here. 

I tried to defend him at first by saying that he wasn't settled in - Kenny has not given him a consistent role and I think that has harmed his production. I don't think he plays well as an inverted winger (shooting is not his strength), and I would prefer to see him play wider and send in more crosses on his strong foot. As it is, it appear as if his first instinct is to cut inwards and look to play a pass. Our team really lacks a true winger and it shows. 

Now I'm beyond frustrated with him. I've given up on him. His performance against United sealed the deal - not only was he poor, he was practically non-existent. His few touches all went to the defense and he made several poor challenges. Henderson had a *very* poor game and still showed 100x the effort of Downing and was far more involved in the game. We would have been better off with 10 men on the pitch than the waste that Downing was that day. 

I tried very hard to reserve judgement with Downing, but he's shown no signs of being a quality player. He's actually regressed over this season. Sell him for a major loss or leave him on the bench until he finds some desire - I just don't see a high level of effort or desire from him right now. Not to mention that his confidence is clearly at an all-time low. 

He has not shown that he fits in with the team for whatever reason, and I'd rather see young players get a chance than waste minutes on him. Let's rely on Kuyt, Bellamy, Gerrard, and Henderson to be our wide players and leave Stuart until he sorts his shit out.

true,widgetas,null,null,"It depends what number you're looking at. Until a few years ago the CofE measured ""Sunday attendance"" for their followers. Then they shifted to weekly and now it's ""monthly attendance"". Guess why?

By their own numbers, it's well under [1 million on the ""Usual Sunday Attendance""](http://www.churchsociety.org/issues_new/church/stats/iss_church_stats_attendance.asp). Having looked through the other stats recently, I am somewhat cynical as to how they come by their numbers. Look, for example, at the figures for young people. For one thing kids don't really have a say whether or not they go to church so I don't understand why the CofE gets all excited that the number of kids going hasn't really decreased. [However, look at the difference between 'Children and Young People (under 16 years of age)' weekly attendance - lowest and highest (page 2)](http://www.churchofengland.org/media/1179117/2009provisionalattendance.pdf). L: 95,000, H: 436,000 in 2009. That's a phenomenal difference! The difference is marked in adults too: L: 671,00, H: 1,252,000. Over the course of 4/5 weeks, the number of kids varies by over 400%, with adult variance coming it at 200%!

What I think is that there is a skewing of the data by either church parade or similar. All the Scouts, Cubs, Girl Guides and Brownies show up one week of the month and their combined numbers add to the average.

Not that it really matters, of course, but the upshot is that I think the CofE official attendance figures are actually lower than even they will admit.",0,1329266646,null,0,false,0,c3rarpf,t3_potkr,t1_c3rarpf,t1_c3r686z,null,1428355136,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

My advice is to keep taking lessons and pass your test, that way when you get to a point where you are older, and your insurance drops to a more affordable level, you can put that you have held your license for X number of years, which will lower the cost a bit as you wont show up as a new driver. Granted you wont have no claims bonus but they wont know why. 

And also look into travel cards/grants from college or your local council, the latter are useful to ask as sometimes they do schemes for local students in local areas. The train/bus websites can be unreliable when it comes to knowing what you can and can't get as a discount, as can the staff when you phone up :-/ Your college should give you some good guidance too as to what you might get discounted.

By the by, I'm not sure I've ever used those words against anyone when discussing Islam. In fact I've had them used against me, I think.

Note the number of commenters compared to the number of downvotes. In my experience, and using this as an example, people seem to automatically assume that a criticism of Islam in such a way (i.e. not direct theistic criticisms) means you're a friend of a the EDL or the BNP.

This has gone from a manager discussion to a general complaining about the lack of investment in the squad. It seems to be the way all conversations about Leeds go. I wonder why that is?

Maybe, maybe not.

&gt;Things will have changed since you were actively involved in the British legal profession

Considerably.  Back then it was all done according to the 1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act, but it's been extensively amended and updated since.

&gt;did the paperwork your clients were offered mention a caution?

From memory, and it's a long time ago, detainees were provided only with a written record of their rights (to have someone informed of their arrest, to legal advice etc.) and a copy of their custody record upon charge/release (or for up to a year after).  They were also able to request a copy of the PACE Act/Codes of Practice, but this wasn't advertised and few did.  In fact, I remember once getting pretty pissy with a custody sergeant when I was called on the 24 hour rota without a copy and I was initially refused one (he claimed the detainee was entitled, but I - as his legal rep - wasn't, despite the fact the public at large are supposed to have access to it and despite, as I pointed out, I'd advise my client to request it and he could then pass it to me...Sometimes they just like to test your resolve and be obstructive by default).  So, at that time, no mention of cautions (in any written documentation I mean, they existed of course).

Conditional Cautioning appears to be covered in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and this [code of practice](http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/others/conditionalcautioning04.html) applies.  It does seem from these that a prosecutor has to determine that there is sufficient evidence to charge.  Ordinary formal cautions were less rigorous and, although guidance suggested there should be reasonable prospects for a conviction, this was a decision the police could take independently.

&gt;And would you have advised a client who had already admitted a minor, opportunistic theft to the police to accept a caution over going to trial?

You'd always hope to get there before an arrestee admitted anything, although the police had many games to try and arrange things so that they already had.",0,1329283581,null,0,true,0,c3rdo61,t3_ppm9c,t1_c3rdo61,t1_c3rczru,null,1428356505,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Well I've been a fan for 3/4ish years now, but I watched classic chronologically. Finished a few months ago. It took 6 months at a pretty darn fast pace. And it was awesome. Once you get used to old tv and augment your viewing with www.wifeinspace.com, it's a breeze and a joy.

Here's how to get into classic: First thing you do? Watch Genesis of the Daleks. then a quick rundown for the best stories of each Doctor:

William Hartnell, first- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore. The Romans. The Tenth Planet (though the last part is reconstruction only).

Patrick Troughton, second - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

Jon Pertwee, third- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

Tom Baker, fourth The most famous run. There are so many fantastic stories. Genesis of the Daleks, one of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic. And Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

Peter Davison, fifth -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special, andCaves of Androzani!* (the last story)

Colin Baker, sixth- His Doctor is unique with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good.

Sylvester McCoy, seventh. Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis. This is the era where they really try some crazy radical stories.",0,1329283970,null,0,true,0,c3rdqdd,t3_pqaxk,t1_c3rdqdd,t3_pqaxk,null,1428356545,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

Downing? He's 27 years old with a considerable amount of experience in the Premier League. He was supposed to be a strong and steady force on the team.

I guess the question now is... why?
Is Dalglish using him incorrectly?

Come 1996, and there's been a kiss (either romantic or otherwise) at least once per Doctor/series. Almost as though there's a contractual clause or something

1. His natural abilties and skills

Yes, and the obvious example: 

I have friends who had to jump through religious hoops to get their child into a good local Catholic school. Trouble is that *all* the schools nearby are faith schools, so they had no choice: play the game, ie be hypocritical &amp; pretend they were church-goers etc (good way for the church to pick up lapsed punters for sure, but hardly a role for the education system!), or stick to their principles and have their child literally last on the local lists. What a horrible position to be put in by an education system everyone has no choice but to pay for.

So, you're right, in most cases, pragmatism wins, people play along for the good of their children, and the system carries on. And effectively people are forced into religion. Not good imho. 

And what about when parents aren't so caring and won't play along? The child ends up last on the list by default.

Yes, we are in transition but I can understand that as a manager he cannot simply say, “We need a major clear-out!” and expect the older players to remain happy. Despite not agreeing with all the decisions of AVB, I think it’s likely that some of the more recent results could have come as a result of the players knowing exactly this fact, that they are diminishing in their importance and that many will soon be gone. Giving their all in this situation will always be hard – not that I excuse a lack of pride when wearing the badge.

I think AVB is trying to lessen their roles very very slowly, which is the right thing to do so we don't part ways with those legends on bad terms, but said players aren't doing the right thing in complaining or ""revolting"". (I guess I'm directing this a little more at Lamps at the moment, who recently has been complaining to the press.)


AVB needs his own team, I'm eager to see Chelsea next season, with AVB at the helm after a good transfer window. I think it was a mistake or wishful thinking for him to believe that the old dogs would figure prominently and pull us through this season.


All that said, some of his tactics have been shaky recently, but I think the team will improve with the right players who get behind him, you can already see that in Mata.

If you request legal advice on arrival at a police station or any time thereafter but don't have any details, they'll use this list (and you should always always request representation immediately, before you speak to the police, there are only a limited number of reasons they can delay it).  In the old days, some of the people sent from this list were ex coppers or legally unqualified people, there've been improvements since, but you're still better off having a specific firm/legal representative in mind (so keep a business card or whatever with you, just in case).  

The best advice before your brief arrives is to provide nothing but your name and address (you don't even have to give DoB etc.) and to politely refuse everything they request from you and ask for your objections to be recorded by the custody sergeant, but not to resist if they insist (they'll know what they're allowed to take without consent, and if they overstep the mark, your refusal and the written evidence of it will prove invaluable).  Personally, I wouldn't sign anything either; if you do sign something (e.g. to agree any property they take), make sure you read what you're signing very carefully and sign directly under it so nothing can be added in later.  If you're totally innocent as a new born and want to help, fine, sobeit, but at least wait until you've got legal representation first, there is no reason to assist in any way before, it provides you with absolutely no advantage, whatever the police may tell you.  The police job is to gather evidence against you, not to hear your side of the story.  Avoid informal, off the record chats, even about matters seemingly unrelated - you never know where the conversation is leading, what their agenda is, and once someone starts talking and the police get to build up a rapport, it becomes increasingly hard to stop and can look very bad for you if you suddenly clam up when they touch on a matter which is complicated or difficult to explain, even where this has nothing to do with guilt.

Keep these three names in mind. You'll never read them anywhere in CFC-related discussions, articles, news, etc. 

Yet, these three are always in the thick of things whenever huge upheavals happen at the club. You'll never find any quotes from them - save the standard ""CFC is a great club"" kind of standard drivel. You'll never find them criticising or praising anything CFC-related. 

They prefer to remain in the shadows and prefer to operate from the shadows. They are the true kingmaker of the club. 

I honestly don't know how much of a part these three had in bringing AVB to the club but if they did, AVB is pretty much safe. If they didn't, I hope sincerely that Roman learns to keep his trigger finger in ice.

AVB is astute - the signings of Mata &amp; Romeu and playing Sturridge in the first team are evidence of that - according to me. AVB is frugal - Cahill at 7 mn and Meireles at 9 mn, remember? AVB is looking at the future - Lukaku, Piazon, Davila, Da Silva brothers, Bamford; and this is just his first year. AVB is tactically sound - 4-3-3 has brought us a few wins (and close-fought draws) earlier, remember? 

That's the positives I could think of. So, are there negatives? Yup, you bet!

AVB is young - not his fault, exactly. However, it has worked against him. The 'senior' players (read: 'egotistical fucktards') have done more to undermine him than the media. AVB has an ego - this actually is a good thing but unfortunately, since he doesn't have the 'credentials' to back it up and since the players have both (the egos and credentials) his ego gets kinda dwarfed. It also is a quick shortcuts to the notion that AVB is bad at man-management. AVB is diminutive - you can't really announce a presence in a dressing room full of 6-plus feet tall players with 12-plus feet tall egos, when you are significantly smaller.  Yeah, I kid, but it does make you think, doesn't it?) 

What gets my goat is the fact that players who are being paid tens and hundreds of thousands of pounds per week can allow their egos to affect their morale. Heck, at my job, if I don't deliver, I get fired. I don't care who my boss is, I am being paid to do my job. If the boss doesn't like what I am doing and he tells me, I can either choose to try his suggestions or quit - there's no shame in the latter. No one is perfect; we all have our own style and we can't always be flexible. Why can't it be the same for these guys?

One last point: Maybe AVB is shredder than we give him credit. What if he chooses to play the 'senior' players week in, week out as a message to the fans? ""Look, these are the guys you idolise, these are the guys who brought this club all the success you know of. However, these guys are now past their prime and they need to go. I'm making you go through this trauma to ensure that you agree with me when I eventually let the axe drop.""

Animals are slaughtered for a purpose, and they are usually slaughtered in a quick and humane manner. Most of their body parts get used for one thing or another. Offal might go into sausages or pet food. Meat obviously gets packed and sent to stores across the country. There is an actual reason to slaughter livestock. That is not evil, simply a more ""processed"" way of doing what mankind has done for millennia: hunt, kill and eat animals. Minus the hunting part.

If you cannot differentiate between senselessly murdering a pet and slaughtering an animal for food, there might be something wrong with you. Would you be okay with somebody walking into your house and decapitating your dog? Because that's the equivalent. The chickens weren't dogs, but they were still somebody's beloved pets.

Thats between £330 and £450 a week, or £17k to £23k a year, but doesn't include CTB or LHA, which could add another £5k - £6k/yr on top. 

I *do* agree with you about the additional needs and expenses for disabled people - I'm a carer and just had to fork out £150 for a new set of wheelchair batteries for example.  I also think people see the 'Family claims £xx,xxx in benefits' headlines and assume that that all cash in the pocket, when in reality CTB is just the local council moving money around it's own accounting system and LHA is usually paid directly to the landlord, or forget that reasonable percentage is non-means tested (DLA, CB, and up to a point CTC), so out of this maximum of £450/wk, he would be entitled to £150-£200 (DLA, CB and CTC) of it assuming he's not over the limit for the CTC if he was working, as would anybody else in the same situation.

They say we are in a transition period. Where exactly is the transition? Week in and week out we see the same lineup, the same (progressively defensive) tactics, the same inefficiency inside the attacking third. There is very little creativity, very little structure, poor decision making (on part of the players) - and it all seems to fall back on the acceptance of lowered standards and fake positive-reinforcement. Take for example, the last game against Everton. We gave up a goal within 5 minutes from a THROW IN..and not a fuck was given, word said, nor action taken. And yes, I understand that mistakes happen, but this wasn't the first time, especially from the player in question.. and it is not as though we don't have other options, we did just buy a defender for this very reason. If AVB wants the respect and cooperation of the players, he needs to make fucking example out of poor performances, not take the blame or sugar coat the problem. And no, not just to prove a point, but for the best interests of the group.. because they are constantly letting the team down.

This all leads me to my point, being; where/when is our transition? Where are these so called ""transition players"" that should be getting experience for the future? Where are all of these ""star"" purchases we have been investing money into? Either being sent on loan, or on the bench.  Abramovich seems to really enjoy buying cars and parking them in the garage.. Sturridge is a perfect example from last year to this year. Imagine if he was performing for us when we took on MU at the end of last season. Why was our confidence in him so misplaced when he was given no real chance? No, we don't need to be starting and running these players into the ground, but we can give them an opportunity. I am a firm believer of the saying, ""if it's not broke, don't fix it;"" but this is a two way street.. I would be completely fine with our performances and sub-par form if Chelsea WAS in fact giving its younger players an opportunity to gain experience and/or trying several different things to see what clicks. In the long run, what would we be sacrificing? A possible year out of the Champions League for a chance to be a powerhouse in 3? And I do get the argument about needing to be in the Champions League, but the point is moot; it seems to be happening anyway, and with no gain. Everybody keeps saying ""BUY"", but we have bought and it clearly isn't the solution. How about we try to develop what we already have; develop players, develop a positive team atmosphere, develop a sense loyalty to teammates and not selves. 

What we have now is **not** working. I have seen no positive attempt to change it. ",0,1329314119,null,0,true,0,c3rgg3r,t3_pqhzh,t1_c3rgg3r,t1_c3rfb7e,null,1428357834,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

The NHS makes people wait for appointments, for example the average wait for a dermatology appointment is 2-3 months, however it is always 2-3 months if they can hold it at that wait time they could just run extra clinics to catch up and hold it 2 weeks to a month as the average wait time.

You're supposed to exist on bread and gruel and still have the motivation and energy to look for work! Yes, even when the smug bastards in society have pushed you face first into the mood.

Oh right and then there are the people who smugly say 'well I've never claimed'. That's nice, good for you, but that's largely luck that you've never found yourself in a situation where you needed to. No, you are not special and you are not better than anyone else.

Yes you get money 'for nothing' but it's just about enough to survive on. Typically you will not be going on holidays most years, you will not be buying luxuries, you will be having only the cheapest foods you can buy, the cheapest clothes when the old ones are falling apart, little Johnny and Olivia won't be getting music and sports lessons and expensive birthday parties, there are no meals out, few if any cinema trips.

Disgust? Judgement? Man, some people just have no fucking empathy at all.

It's been an long, long time since I was on the dole, and I didn't get any vouchers for milk or veg, but I think I would be wanting to eat more than, well, milk and veg. 

As Mr Goodall says himself:
&gt;[running a car] is cheaper than using unsubsidised public transport by just over £100 a year. That's two weeks' food shopping to us. 

A family of four, £50 quid a week, on food. I don't know about you, but I don't think that's an unreasonable amount to spend on feeding yourself even if you are getting ""milk and veg"" vouchers.

£30-40 quid a week for Utilities is high, but if they are using a prepayment meter **and** paying off arrears, most of that money isn't going to actually be paying for light and heat.

So 11k a year equates to £211 a week, there's £80-90 quid gone already in just those two items. Add in tax, insurance, fuel, maintenance for the car, telly licence, day to day stuff for the kids and it soon disappears. I do not envy this life.

I had really bad eczema last year that had become infected, it took me 10 weeks to see a specialist who took one look at me, wrote me out a long prescription and it completely cleared up in two weeks. 10 weeks of feeling like shit, clawing my skin off, not sleeping properly, not being able to work properly and basically being a horrid person to be around for a 5 min consultation. 

That's IMO is far too long to have to wait. 

I must admit though when I did eventually get to see the specialist he  was totally apologetic on behalf of the NHS for making me wait so long.

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"&gt;You're naive if you think the doctor didn't have sex in 900 years of being alive. Time lords aren't sexless. They'd have no reason to have male and females if they didn't have a sexual function. And as noted, he has had a family.

I'm not the only one to think that. There is (licensed) *Doctor Who* media out there - the novel *Lungbarrow*, for example, which served as a sort of spiritual successor to the final televised season of the classic series - that has the Time Lords reproducing asexually. I'm no biologist, so who's to say that Time Lords (or Gallifreyans in general, since not all Gallifreyans are Time Lords) *have* to have sex to reproduce? They are aliens, after all?

Continuing that thought...

&gt;They'd have no reason to have male and females if they didn't have a sexual function. And as noted, he has had a family.

Again, I'm not a biologist, so I don't know if having male and female genders *has* to result (or cause) a sexual function. As you can tell, I'm not a logician, either. 

&gt;Maybe they were too prudish back then. 

That's certainly true - there was a rule during Peter Davison's days that the Doctor was not allowed to do so much as put an arm around his companions, and that's it. It was a British thing. Stiff upper lip and all. No sex please, we're British. 

I don't think that was the only reason, though: I think the writers' focus was elsewhere. Conversely, if they were ""too prudish"" back then, what are they now? I'd suggest there's definitely influence from contemporary television of today. I don't watch much TV outside of *Doctor Who*, but I do appreciate how the program has evolved, changed and developed to not only survive, but thrive in a modern entertainment environment. The idea of exploring the Doctor's sexuality is simply one change I don't like. It doesn't define my enjoyment of *Doctor Who*. 

&gt;The newer series have looked deeper into the Doctor. Deeper into his motivations, his personalities, what makes him happy, and even what he fears. We even saw him shed a tear.

Heh, you've unwittingly hit on another thing I'm not fond of, which is that the Doctor seems to *cry* an awful lot. That's a bit more understandable for me - there's a shade of precedent in that (5 got quite emotional a few times), and obviously since the conclusion of the Time War, the Doctor is a different person. I do like that change, I think it's a good development. I just wish he didn't cry so damnably *much*, so that when he *did*, there's a lot more impact to it. 9 only shed a tear once, and to me that was incredibly powerful. 10 blubbered an awful lot (""Last of the Time Lords"" and ""The End of Time"") come to mind. 11 cries a tad too much for my liking - he got weepy in ""The Big Bang"", ""The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe"", and ""The Doctor's Wife"", and those are only the ones I remember. 

I think it certainly is possible to look deeper into the character of the Doctor, but one thing that surprises me is how biologically human he's turning out to be. To be honest, and you might have gleamed this, I grew up watching the dead end of the classic series, when the Doctor (and by extension, the Time Lords) were distant, cold and aloof. Not necessarily prudish - that's more me than them - but very distinctly *alien*. I get that humanity is the Doctor's favourite species, but I don't get that after millennia of traveling through time and space, he's suddenly got more of a libido now than he ever had. I don't get that after a millennia of staring death and danger in the face without blinking, now we see him cry like a human. I don't get that after a millennia of (symbolically) tipping his hat and TARDIS'ing off into the sunset, now we see him cry out of happiness - like a human. 

If the Doctor was human, I'd have no problem with him exhibiting these traits. My concern is that the Doctor is *not* human. To have him be so biologically and emotionally human downplays a subtly fundamental alien element of his physiology, and even his character. 

(Maybe 8 was right all along. Maybe he *is* half-human on his mother's side.) 

And to me, that does not compute because the Doctor simply isn't human. One of the (many) reasons I love *Doctor Who* is because the protagonist is this mysterious alien who we cannot understand, but have to trust. Making him someone I can understand and relate to - he's got a sex drive, he cries when he's emotional - dulls that sense of secrecy a bit. He's still a very cryptic character, is the Doctor, but that aura of impenetrability has been reduced.

Maybe he's getting old. He was a young man when he started traveling. Maybe a millennia of being alone (because despite his army of friends and allies, he is lonely) and constantly confronting evil is taking its toll on him. If that's the case, I think there are better ways to write it than the Doctor getting jiggy and weepy. 

&gt;What it seems like here is just that you hate River Song. You're one of the few because she's an awesome character.

It's certainly possible. When Alex Kingston suggested that she'd be returning for Series 7, I can't exactly confess to doing cartwheels and jumping for joy. I know I'm in a minority with my dislike for the character, but there's a surprising amount of backlash against her - there was a subreddit here a month or so ago asking for thoughts on her character, and there were far more negative opinions than there were positive. 

And this is *Reddit*. Can you imagine the reaction on a more established *Doctor Who* forum, like Gallifrey Base?

For Pubs:

[**Brauhaus:**](http://www.viewedinburgh.co.uk/pubsandbars/brauhaus-review-57074.html)

The best for beer, owner's very knowledgeable and they have a great selection. He also run's Nina's Mini Market round the corner which is the best off licence in Edinburgh.  One of my favourites but always gets busy.

Pretty relaxed atmosphere, also pretty pricey but that's because you're paying for a great selection of great beers - in my opinion it's good value.  Not a big tourist bar as it's hidden away a bit. Gets a fair number of students (like me!) but it isn't a student-y bar.

[**Brewdog:**](http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/brewdog-edinburgh) 

Again has a great selection of beers, if more limited than Brauhaus - bottles are way too expensive but they do great beers on tap.  Different atmosphere, they're more ""hipster"" if I could call it that, though I'm sure they don't like being pigeonholed...But really knowledgeable staff again, always willing to offer advice.

Atmosphere - as I said slightly pretentious but good music and a pretty good crowd.  Not cheap again but same as Brauhaus, you're paying for good quality.  On the Cowgate so not the most peaceful location and I guess could draw in tourists/people on pub crawls who don't know it's not the same as the rest of the Cowgate bars.

[**The Bow Bar**](http://www.list.co.uk/place/22427-the-bow-bar/), [**Bennets**](http://www.list.co.uk/place/13876-bennets-bar/), [**Cloisters**](http://www.list.co.uk/place/102899-the-cloisters/) and [**the Blue Blazer:**](http://www.bestpubs.co.uk/layout0.asp?pub=105813) 

All are more traditional pubs but still have an atmosphere - aren't as stiff as the likes of the [**Canny Man's**](http://www.bestpubs.co.uk/layout0.asp?pub=105837).  Do some good Real Ales - Bow Bar's the best of them for that and probably my favourite Edinburgh pub, Cloisters and Blue Blazer also do some beers that are fairly uncommon whereas Bennets is better for Whisky.  

All of them get busy all the time from my experience, in the evenings at least, but it's worth going in even if you have to stand.  None of them are very touristy - Blue Blazer and Bow Bar are near the Grassmarket so I guess are more likely to be stumbled upon by tourists.  They all get a share of students too, but again, aren't studenty. Less expensive than the other two, but again I wouldn't exactly call them cheap.     

[**Earl of Marchmont:**](http://www.list.co.uk/place/103181-earl-of-marchmont/)

Good if you happen to be in Marchmont, but it's tiny and busy. Nice atmosphere, the most studenty of the ones I've mentioned since it's bang in the middle of Student-ville.  Not at all touristy.  There's a cheaper bar across the street from it, but it's worth paying a bit extra since it's a nice wee bar with a good atmosphere and staff with good music taste. 

[**The Holyrood 9A:**](http://www.list.co.uk/place/103625-the-holyrood-9a/)

Nice selection of beers again, less so music... Has more of an after-work, professional vibe, and prices that reflect that. A bit louder and rowdier than the ones above, at least when I've been there.

[**Lebowskis:**](http://www.lebowskis.co.uk/) 

Good if for nothing else than to try the ~20 types of White Russian they have there. I recommend it on a Saturday, they have a good folk band in then usually. Not too expensive, White Russians about £5, pints about £3 for something nice.  Quite a bustling atmosphere, always people dancing by the end of the night.

For cocktail bars:

[**Bramble:**](http://www.bramblebar.co.uk/)

Best cocktail bar by far in my opinion.  Pretty good value for what you get too, cocktails are all about £7 and are really good, and Hendricks and tonic is about £3.  Is close to George Street but hasn't been touristy when I've been there. Very laid back and cool atmosphere inside - the kind of music you'd associate with cocktail bars back in the golden age, seats tucked into nooks and crannies.

[**Dragonfly**](http://www.dragonflycocktailbar.com/) is also good, even if it doesn't look it from the outside, though I've only been there the once so can't really judge it, and [**the Cuckoo's nest**](http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/the-cuckoos-nest-edinburgh) used to be one of my regulars, when it did good cocktails for half the price of the others, but it's got a wee bit more expensive now - it has much more of a student clientele than the other two.

I'm not a big fan of anything on the Royal Mile or the Grassmarket really (except [**the Last Drop**](http://www.nicholsonspubs.co.uk/thelastdropgrassmarketedinburgh/), which is a lot nicer than its neighbours but still suffers a bit from location which attracts a lot of tourists and stag parties, etc) and I don't venture into New Town often enough to know about there, though I hear there are some great pubs that way too.",0,1329326606,null,0,false,0,c3rig0v,t3_pptc1,t1_c3rig0v,t3_pptc1,null,1428358831,2,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,2

I killed our neighbors' dog with a few shots from a .44 pistol after being woken up at 5am by the screams of terrified rabbits (oh, you thought rabbits were quiet? Usually are. The exception is something to hear).

I shot him once in the body from the deck as he raced around our backyard in a circle chasing the few remaining rabbits, then a few more times in the gut up close before a headshot.

This dog had wrenched open several hutch doors and killed three or four Angoras (whos blood-matted wool was useless) plus two of my brothers' and sisters' pets (Norwegian and Lop). I had to finish off two of them myself with an ax because no way I'm going to risk a ricochet off the ground through a thin little rabbit skull.

So I went to the neighbor's house and knocked on the door to wake him up, which launched him immediately into cussing about why was I getting him up so early. So I told him, ""your dog dug into our yard again, and I killed him; come pick up the body."" 

Now, I had to stay out of arms reach on the way back to our yard, because he was screaming bloody murder and telling me what he was going to do to me for, and telling me what kind of asshole neighbor I was for killing his good'ole dog just for getting into our yard. That screaming and yelling didn't stop until he came around the corner and saw the carnage. 

Five dead rabbits, bodies torn open, blood everywhere, and my 5-year-old sister sobbing disconsolately with blood on her pajamas from trying to pet her dead bunny. Two older boys sitting on the steps hiding their faces trying not to cry.

We are in the middle of a transition, unfortunately it takes a couple of years to see the full effects.  Chelsea/AVB have made a good start so far: Luiz, Ramires, Romeu, Sturridge, and Mata are all players that are part of this new generation that are currently playing a major role.  Then include Lukaku, Piazon, Courtois, and De Bruyne and that is a lot of new names that have come in the last 2 years that look to play a major part for Chelsea.
  
I fully expect and believe that this summer will be THE biggest summer of the Abramovich era.  You will see big players leave and many players come in that will have an impact on the club.  We could have has few as 3 players around 30 playing for Chelsea next year (Terry, Cole, Cech) and all the rest will be players from the ""transition"".  I think Chelsea has made a promising start, but definitely need to invest in some worldclass wingers and a RB this summer.

I do agree with some of your points though, like the fact that AVB needs to change some stuff THIS season.  He doesn't have the players to make his style work so HE needs to change.  This summer, when he can mold a team to his liking, he can play the way he wants to.  Right now, he needs to stop being stubborn and adapt to the players he has.

true,felloutboy,null,null,"and the moral of the story is to host your website on a domain like .ws or .to or another nation/domain where the USA can't cut you off. Soca may have done this, but it is the USA that control .com DNS services and registrations so only they could actually cut off the site. bbc is so full of shit - they don't even explain what the site was doing. Was it hosting torrent files, hosting links to locker files, or directly hosting content? I suspect the latter for them to be shutting it down and making arrests.

the takedown notice threatening fines and prison is just pure bullshit - there is no law against visiting a website and downloading any content on it (apart from the criminal laws against the usual stuff where possesion is the crime). The worst case scenario is a civil suit for compensation by the rights holder. There is no way they could ever know beyond doubt who had downloaded a file (assuming it was on the actual site in the first place, in which case the server logs would give up IP addresses for downloaders but typically those logs get routinely wiped daily). IF they proved you had downloaded a file then you have 'cheated' them out of the wholesale price of the equivalent CD or itunes download so their case can only claim that amount plus a proportionate fine. By downloading an album you are not 'making available' or 'redistributing' the copyright content to others, which is the semi-genuine grievance the owners have against bittorrent and also the reason the Napster case in the states was so costly for the woman they took to court as a test case. She was sharing, downloading is not sharing.

As for Soca maintaining that some sort of theft from the artists has occurred - well that is a just pitifully week attempt at bullying. Cybercrime laws exist where appropriate, but copyright infringement is not one of those areas, nor will it be for a while at least, as it speaks to civil liberties and fair use doctrine.

And the reason that I tuned out wasn't because of change, but because the show stayed too much the same. General storylines from a few seasons earlier were being recycled with different characters, and bold ideas that looked like they'd be game-changers were diffused instead. 


I think one of the reasons ""Dr. Who"" has lasted as long as it has is that the game does change every so often. People call it a long-running series, but it's really a lot of different television shows spun off from each other. When an idea has been seen through entirely, it can be replaced with a new one. Will I like post-Moffat ""Dr. Who""? I don't know.

Whilst Sacound might be exaggerating slightly with the 'half of my town' (I can hear his voice in that statement).  I wouldn't dismiss his claims out of hand.  Although he identifies with Cardiff, that could mean anywhere within a large radius.  I explain I'm from Swansea, but my home is actually 30 miles away.  Since nobody will have heard of it.

Your point concerning the tabloids is insightful, but there are other perspectives to consider in regard to this matter.

Living in a shitty town, with no infrastructure and hope is a bleak existence.  With stable jobs over an hour away on shit money does not  inspire people.  Even good jobs - and that's relative, can turn over quickly. Two month in, then it's end of contract.  Add in a bit of Macho culture which can look down on 'stacking shelves'.  The dark thoughts of #why should I bother?' creeps in.

You then get an echo chamber effect, Mr A is doing it why should I care? then Mr B is doing it, why should I bother?  Who can be arsed is the religion in a community.

Before long it's a case of fighting to get to the bottom.  Like the city bankers, there is a competition on who can get away with the most. 

I'm not condoning anything, making light of anything, or living it, just want to explain there are two sides a point.

That and ""ditziness"" or ""dappiness"", particularly among women. Of course it could be that this isn't a new phenomenon.

I always fall back to Jade Goody when it comes to this particular topic. I don't think she was stupid as such, but she was rather ignorant on a good deal of subjects, mainly 'general knowledge' and seemed to be successful because of this ignorance. ""Where's East Angular?"" became a repeated soundbite, iirc. In fact the common or garden Big Brother contestant, particularly after series 1 (and now I'm thinking of [Helen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Adams)), seemed to be on the 'less well learned' side of things. Of course I've got to cover my arse in so far as explaining that I'm not of the opinion that ""if you don't get ace marks in your GCSEs then you're worthless"" - I don't think that at all. But there's a difference between not doing too well academically (it doesn't suit everyone) and revelling in knowing, or being able in, apparently very little that isn't trivial. But of course it depends what you think is trivial and that's somewhat subjective. When it comes to people like Goody, she will no doubt have known a huge amount of issues and interests relevant to her life. Why did she need to know anything about [Einstein](http://www.prettyandstupid.com/idiot/48)?

I think the author has to be careful here as she does come across in one or two places as being what some might call 'elitist'. That's fine, of course, if she wants to give that impression or likes that. It could be that I sound similar here, though I've tried not to be.

If anyone thinks I need to be taken down a snobby-peg or two, feel free to let me know why and I'll try and extricate myself!

&gt;11 posts about gifts given/received

How is a picture of a sonic screwdriver purchased for someone I've never met by their girlfriend/boyfriend fun? 

Is my brain wired wrong? Am I supposed to delight in seeing the things you've managed to acquire from Amazon? I usually squeal with delight when I'm watching someone doing their shopping in Tesco, but I just don't get it when it's posted online. 

&gt;7 posts of joke links

Joke links, well I could see how they could be fun or at least funny. But I might not laugh, furthering my existential crisis that I just don't know what fun is any more!


&gt;4 posts promoting merchandise

How is a link to buy something fun? Maybe you could buy something that is fun for you then take a photo and post it back online so I can see how much fun you're having while I'm not having any fun because I'm looking at your photo thinking ""what is wrong with me? I don't find this fun.""

Man, I just don't know how to have fun! That's it, I can't take it

&gt;Calm down dears.... 'They are not paying tax at source' is not the same as 'they are not paying tax'. As long as it is a UK-registered limited company - and nothing here suggests that it is not - then when they take money out of their company to pay bills they pay tax and NI at the usual rates PLUS either employer's NI or corporation tax.

&gt;This is not tax avoidance by any stretch of the imagination, it's just taxed at a different point in the chain. I work under a similar arrangement and I reckon that I might be about half to one percent better off. Once you take into account the insurances I have to carry and the cost of running the company, it works out about the same as being an employee, except that I don't get the fat pension, company car, health insurance, paid holiday, sick pay....

I'd say that in my similar situation, I'm a lot more than a half to one percent better off (maybe as much as ten percent) - but remember contractors lack benefits like paid holiday and sick leave, and our companies' services could be dispensed with at the drop of a hat.  

Mind you, we also have to navigate IR35, and I can't see how the people in this article could consider themselves outside its purview.

Since decision points seem to splinter into parallels, dimensions close to each other should have similar reality co-efficients. The other concept we need is an osmotic pressure of reality. That means that while decision points splinter into parallels, there is an overall pressure of reality to maintain and merge timelines, so if the only difference between one universe and another is the color of the collar of my shirt, something perhaps could cause those two universes to merge and become one.

He knows he is an older player, and he can't go box to box like a young Lampard once could. The trailing runs into the box and the goals are still there, though. Reminds me a lot of Giggs and his progression throughout his 30s.

Pretty sure Drogba is almost done, as he has slowed down a huge amount in the past year. Since his bout with malaria, the skills are still there, but the fitness just isn't. I can't decide if he just isn't exerting himself or if he really doesn't have it, but his explosiveness is clearly waning.

Terry is still younger than the others (only 31), and I don't know that he's shown any sign of slowing down so far. The fact that he is in defense helps as well, because the #1 issue with aging (loss of pace) is not as noticeable in defense (unless we are getting torn apart by balls over the top). He is a smart player too, and I think he knows what he needs to do as he ages a la Lampard.

I don't think Cole will make it another two years, but not because of his talent/pace. His ankles just aren't going to hold up. I remember hearing him say in an interview that he feels like he is 37 or 38 because of his ankles, and I know he gets tons of treatment after each match to make sure they hold up for him. Its a good thing for the squad that we have Bertrand/Van Aanholt because we're going to need them here in a few years.

The Cech situation is weird because he's still young, he's a great player with a long history at the club, GKs can play into their late 30s no problem, and because Courtois is looking like the real deal.

There are many options such as flying through wormholes, superstring manipulation, certain versions of the alcubierre drive etc. that are theoretical but they are predicted to be possible by our current theories. Then if you are willing to expand your definition of time travel there is definately travel to the future via relativistic time dilation. Quantum entanglement can work through the 4th dimension so in some respects that is time travel although it can't send useful information. And if you set up the equations in a particular way, you can think of antimatter as just regular matter moving backwards through time (which has actually led to a very interesting theory that actually all the matter in the universe is just a small handful of fundamental particles going back and forth through time.) And finally since time is a property of our 4 dimensional universe, if you exited our universe and came back, you could appear at any time or place, and exiting our universe may be possible in a sufficiently large magnetic gradient (this theory should be put to the test very soon and could explain a few tests that show seasonal variations in the decay rates of some particles)

That being said, this is bigger than Suarez and his pride, ego or reputation. This became about Liverpool Football Club, an institution that is far greater than any single player or manager. 

While I understand Suarez's decision to snub Evra on a personal level (the financial you mention is pretty small relative to his wages, £40k), as a professional representing the club, he made what should have been a fleeting moment in to the history of football in to a larger ordeal by refusing to shake. He didn't have to shake his hand out of respect or out of acknowledgement of fault, but as a professional representing **Liverpool Football Club**. What could have ended in a flash of an eye became a monumental event that only causes further distractions to a club that **must* find a way to perform better.

I've been accused of being disloyal to this club, which I have supported for 30 years, and of forgetting the words, ""You'll Never Walk Alone."" But here is my problem, Suarez's decision to lie (and let's not call it anything other  than that) to his manager and club administrators about shaking Evra's hand when he had no intention of doing so shows that he made his own decision to walk alone. He isolated himself when he lied to not just the club, but to us fans. The fans that honestly believed that he was ready to put this behind him. Despite his past, we believed his words, and because he wears red, we had faith in him. He didn't have that same faith in LFC.

For traveling, you can walk or cycle in summer, the trains are a bit expensive (buy a railcard if you are 18-25 and intend to use trains) but there is interrail, Megabus is a lot cheaper but thats only intercity. Hitch-hiking is legal, safe and possible but a bit unreliable. Apparently it's easier in Scotland.

For accomodation, almost all cities have youth hostels, which are typically cheaper than hotels, but keep an eye out for last minute deal websites and things. Couchsurfing is another option which is a nice way to meet people, and wild camping is legal in some places like the incredibly beautiful Dartmoor national park (including I think the whole of Scotland though I'm not sure). In my experience wild camping is fine anywhere as long as you're well hidden enough.

Quite a lot of people speak Engligh but you might want to bring Cornish, Welsh, Urdu and Swahili phrasebooks just in case, you may have heard that the UK is composed of lots of different countries, all of them different, and you might find that some areas won't understand English, or at least your dialect (Canadian accents are notoriously difficult for us Northeners to understand).

Good luck getting here, enjoy your travels, and I am sure I will bump into you at some point when you get here, it's only a little island!",0,1329364092,null,0,false,0,c3rpq1v,t3_prj3q,t1_c3rpq1v,t3_prj3q,null,1428362327,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

It's really not. There aren't any scenes of the Doctor falling in love with her. There aren't any scenes of the Doctor expressing romantic affection for her. There aren't any scenes of the Doctor regarding them as a couple from his perspective.

The Doctor could (and probably did) marry River under the assumption that he's going to die, that he needs to prevent a paradox by marrying before he dies (he seems to assume in two episodes they marry in the future). He might have even done it to make a very abused woman happy at the end of a series that's all about her abuse due to *him.* And yes, he might even have married because of love. But due to the complete absence of scenes suggesting that, and in the wake of nearly 50 years that mitigate against it, I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest Moffat is about to Moffuck an awful lot of people with a denouement that depends on River being married to a Time Lord but lets the Doctor have a ""get out of jail card"" of not actually being in love with her.

""I'm Christian... because I was baptised/my parents brought me up that way.""

I'm slightly disappointed that Dawkins took that line. He didn't need to and corrected it later on. The point is that the people identifying as Christians are doing it *culturally* and are not actively religious. That's all that needed to be said, rather than ""They're not *really* Christians."" It just leaves you open for the establishment to get uppity as Fraser did, even though he appears to agree with Dawkins in general.

Re The full title of the Origin of Species: Somewhat amusing but an irrelevant cheap shot, actually undermining the claimed importance of his own (self identified!) faith. The claim by the top chaps in Christianity is that the Bible is, to a degree, either divinely inspired or a book that at the very least outlines Yahweh's doings and his god-human-son's activities on earth. To imply that people who (by name) follow the religion 'don't really need to know what it's about' is a little disingenuous.

Assuming of course the candidate doesn't themselves make an issue of it, why should it be relevant? In the correct usage of the word 'secular', shouldn't it be ignored entirely?

In terms of deciding whether she is legally allowed to hold office, it is ignored entirely. There should be no barriers in place to exclude religious people from holding office, not should there be any specific privelidges for religious organisations. Secularism is the principle that government should be free from influence by religious institutions, and the freedom from government imposition of religion on the population. 

That is entirely different from a privately run newspaper from publishing things about a person as they have nothing to do with the way the country is governed. We already have libel laws which are supposed to stop the publication of outright lies about a person. Whether or not they are effective is another matter but that has nothing to do with secularism.

I am not defending the newspaper article in particular as I have no specific knowledge regarding the truth of the claims in the article.

Music website takedown - latest
15 February 2012

A warning has been directed at users frequenting a music download site which was taken offline on 14 February by the Serious Organised Crime Agency. The action has prompted wide-ranging responses from website users, the general public, and other sites.

The targeted SOCA activity, which lasted 32 hours, was part of an operational programme aimed at protecting UK businesses and the wider economy.

The website in question specialised in RnB and enabled access to music obtained by hacking, including some which had not yet been released. IFPI estimates losses to legitimate businesses and artists caused by the site to be £15m a year. During the week running up to arrest phase the website had 70,000 users daily, mainly males aged 18 to 25 years.

SOCA has monitored responses since 08.30 on 14 February when rnbxclusive.com was taken offline following the arrest of a man for suspicion of conspiracy to defraud. He has now been released on bail pending further enquiries.

Responses to the takedown have included action by three more music sites. One has taken itself offline voluntarily, one claims to be considering taking itself offline, and another has posted a claim on its home page to now only be dealing in legal music files following the activity. A number of site users have deleted their download histories. Commentary on Twitter and other social media has been global.

SOCA’s holding message to users who had been frequenting the website was taken offline at the conclusion of the first phase of the operation on 15 February

After the speaker's done, the audience ask a few quick questions, then split off into ad hoc groups of whatever size they like to discuss the matter at hand- usually over a drink or two.

I am an adult who deals with people on a daily basis - a bit like all other adults in the UK. We don't need qualifications to look at a school leaver and wonder what happened to their education.

&gt; And what 'mess' do teachers seem to leave children in?

I find a worryingly high percentage who leave secondary school, and don't go to university lack the fundamental basics. They seem very good at using word processors emails, spreadsheets, etc but not at how to compose quality English and maths using those tools.

Take away the tools, and you have an illiterate mass.

Something has gone seriously wrong when the only way a person can be expected to have basic literacy and maths skills today is to go to university.

That's not fair on people who would have once been able to leave school and get a trade and still be able to do the basics to live a normal adult life and didn't need to go to university.

&gt; Maybe you've had bad experiences with education yourself - I don't know - but that is certainly no position to judge all people in the profession by.

Like most people of my age, my education was reasonably decent with some ups and downs. However, I cannot recall any of my contemporaries, either at school - or when I left for work in a shop, my colleagues lacking basic skills to the degree that school leavers today seem to have.

When we hired teenagers for weekend work, we had to teach them how to work out 10% of a price (the hassles we had when it went to 20%!) for credit deals, and oh, gods, the spelling!

And it has got worse, not better in the past decade.

&gt; Please clarify 'mess' and I'll be happy to discuss just how proud I am of the hard-work that I, and thousands of others put in to ensure pupils have the greatest start in life. 

You may be proud of your work, and maybe you are the exception to the rule, but seriously - go out and talk to employers and they will tell you that school leavers today are woefully let down by the education system in preparing them for basic literacy and maths skills.

--

I am not angry at you personally, more at the educational establishment that is letting down the next generation. However, that establishment is made up of individuals, and they collectively have to bear the blame for the mess they are creating.

In light of the current problems, any suggestion that the status-quo should be retained is just insulting to the pupils who are being discarded on the scrap-heap of political activism.

What is proposed in the option being considered might be a failure - or it might be a success. You don't know, and neither do I.

What we do know is that the current system is a dysfunctional mess - any of the proposed changes would struggle to make it worse than it already is.",0,1329398924,null,0,false,0,c3rtd4x,t3_prxf5,t1_c3rtd4x,t1_c3rt8xn,null,1428364043,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I'm pretty sure that it didn't exist in its present form when I was born. As for it being a ""right"", which article of human rights is this enshrined in? 

&gt; This 'social insurance' was brought about by the post war labour movement to ensure that poverty was ended. 

Ah so it would appear that my Dad didn't have this ""right"" from birth either.

JSA is a *benefit* that is intended for people who are seeking employment.

&gt; The individuals aren't getting anything out of the work; this is menial labour that any able bodied person can do.

I'm pretty sure that I already said that they should be getting minimum wage with the prospect of a full time job at the end of it. 

&gt; Also, if you're on JSA and you say ""I'm thinking of starting a business"" they will take the funds away from you because the state can't be seen to subsidise the salaries of businesses in this way.

The longer you are unemployed the less and less chance you have of getting work, and importantly early periods of youth unemployment lead to a lifetime of not catching up.

Doing any kind of work is better (physiologically and CV-wise) than doing nothing, and leads to spin-off benefits like getting a foot in the door or building a network outside your immediate circle. Dependency destroys people.

People like IDS spent years looking at long term unemployment and now question how millions of natives remained on benefits during a huge boom, whilst the nation imported millions of people (often speaking minimal English) who found jobs easily. Schemes like this are an attempt to get people in the habit of working (and the expectation) and to break them out of years of doing nothing. The dependancy culture we created is harming society and chew up the people in it, even though they would turn down the actions required to get out of it.

In terms of execution, by all means criticise. I suspect the Job Centre bully those who don't need the ""training"" into doing it rather than the hard cases it was meant to deal with, as they are presentable and obey. Plus this action has coincided with a recession.

Big companies are probably the only ones who can really take on unpaid people, it will cost them money and importantly management time. In other words only well-off firms, who don't need the labour have the HR people, insurance and other staff time to deal with free workers, and importantly the pain of dealing with JC+.

Poor teachers get seen (and booted), and unresponsive pupils simply cannot hide for a year until parents evening comes around.

Charity shops / community projects / non-profit organisations, etc, etc, would seem to be, to be ideal placement opportunities.

I'm not sure I agree with all this, but if I was hiring a low-skill job and I had two resumes in front of me - one with glowing references from an all night job at Tesco's, and one with no work history for 2 years - the one with the references is getting the job. It's a much lower risk for me.  Hell-  this person works all night for nothing just for the chance to get a job.  That's impressive.  I'm pretty sure they'd rather be working than sitting home drinking and watching TV.

So while I'm somewhat in the minority, I don't entirely disagree with this.  Sure they're working for free, but they're building a CV that will prove to employers they want to work.  If they do this for a month or two then move on to long term employed work - then it's a good investment.

Also, in Tesco's defence, there is definitely quite some cost to them in employing and training people (even if it is just stacking shelves) who probably won't last more than a few weeks.  There's also risks that the employees won't turn up, will steal, will break stuff or will generally cause trouble.  So whilst they are getting free labour, they are also taking on cost and risk to build a 'nursery' for people that will hopefully move on to better jobs.

true,Rotgrub,null,null,"Interestingly enough in the Falklands War Argentina had by far the largest military that could mobilise to the Falklands.  The 'only' aspect which Britain dominated was with regards to it's navy, which obviously could deploy in force.  Even then the Royal Navy was supplemented with a ratio of 2:1 with merchant, civilian and Royal Auxiliary vessels.   If you look at the odds faced by land and air forces they were stacked against the UK.  Even the US military have since released that they thought at the time retaking the Falklands was unachievable and that an ally was drawing itself into a conflict it couldn't win - one which the Monroe Doctrine stated they, the US, wouldn't enter directly.

Of course, despite the MoD rhetoric to bolster its funding the same cannot be said today.  There are more soldiers on the islands, there are more aircraft, more defences, military capability as a launching point in Ascension in the mid Atlantic has been extended.  Aircraft has a much more capable range, and despite the navy's aircraft carriers being temporarily on a hiatus the navy itself could still blockade and control the skies, even strike the Argentinian mainland with impunity. 

The point really is that military escalation against the British Falklands is a moot point.  Argentina is in a far worse position today to invade than they were 30 years ago, and even as diversion-rhetoric from their runaway inflation it doesn't seem to be working with the Argentinian people.  Britain even has the economic moral ground in that it offered to a resource share deal with Argentina which it didn't have to do.

I was never the president of any of the clubs, but I was VP of Science Olympiad and Youth Ending Hunger, as well as treasurer of the Math Club and was also involved in the thespian groups, as well as the A/V kids. Oh... I was also a hardcore music nerd (Manhattan School of Music after High School).

I had, over the course of my life, dozens of offers from countless of my fellow nerd friends to watch classic episodes of Doctor Who back when they were just considered episodes of Doctor Who, as the show was not relaunched. *Every single time* I turned down those friends, yet had no reason. I just never cared or thought about it.

When Doctor Who was relaunched, I decided to give it a shot and fell in love with it. I don't need to go into the myriad reasons that I loved the show since the relaunch, because you all probably have many of the same reasons, but before Tennant came into the picture, I was a huge fan of Doctor Who. That one season with Eccleston as the Doctor and Rose as his companion were what launched me into Doctor Who fandom.

Would I say Eccleston is *my* Doctor, though? Not today, but the day Eccleston regenerated into Tennant, I was really disappointed. I loved Eccleston at the time, and at the time, he was *my* Doctor. Eccleston was to me what Hartnell was to die-hard fans in the 60's. He was *the* Doctor.

Since he brought me into the world of Doctor Who, I have seen all of the new episodes, as well as all of the classic episodes (best way to spend the hiatus between seasons). 

There are so many hands involved in regenerating Doctor Who as a series; hands that have crafted so much of what I needed to fall in love with the show, but the face belonged to Eccleston.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"I'd argue it didn't matter as much. The NHS was very new back then, and it provided a massive boost in healthcare provision which could be suggested to have reinforced the concepts of security in physical labour jobs such as mining as health was not as big a concern. In place of mining, you could look at other kinds of physical jobs in the manufacturing sector, for example.

Britain then also had an industrial sector where an education didn't matter quite as much. Physical jobs were easier to find and required less qualifications. 

With the removal of these jobs (There's been documentaries about former coal miners who have children and there's things such as homelessness and drugs and whatnot) there's some evidence that this 'modest education' you speak of didn't exist as people raised in the 50's are out of work with very poor literacy and standard of education because it was not necessary. It's important now because the majority of jobs require higher levels of education in order to qualify for employment, and we're simultaneously getting more and more keen on assessing our progress in order to make things more efficient, which has been creeping into all kinds of aspects of life progressively over the last decade or two.

I feel education and literacy now is considered significantly more important because the largest employment sector today requires it. There are few alternatives left due to the changes between 1970 and today. In addition to this, we have adopted a performance-assessment culture that has taken the form of targets and breaking down statistics in order to work out how to increase efficiency in almost all aspects of our working life. These two taken together demonstrate an aspect of why it seems like education today is worse. It's entirely plausible we're the ones setting our own benchmarks higher as a result of our assessment culture and we're saying children are failing when the reality is we're just expecting to be able to bring everyone up and improve results identically.",0,1329416664,null,0,false,0,c3rwb23,t3_prxf5,t1_c3rwb23,t1_c3rvsbu,null,1428365457,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

So if literacy is more important, and maths is more important - why has the ability to do basic arithmetic in your head dropped in quality so drastically?

If office jobs dominate, why is literacy skills so weak?

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"Well, I don't think either of us are qualified to explain why literacy skills are so weak. The thing is, you're under an assumption that everyone in the 50s were equally capable of reading and writing - these are the people in their 60's or 70's now, and while it's hard to assess, I can tell you that your assumption is probably incorrect but that is based purely on anecdotal evidence which is not really sound for an overall conclusion.

Still, the 50's aren't important to the discussion, the modern day is. I can't tell you why it has dropped, or more relevantly, even if it has dropped. With an increasing population and a spread of ability, if you are dedicated to assessing the quality and progress of education, which inevitably must have happened in the last 50 years or so at some point, I would not be surprised to find the average declining.

In terms of evidence, if you look at some of the long-term unemployed and find the unemployed have poor arithmetic or English skills and conclude the system is failing, while you would be partially correct, you are looking at a sample of people who are likely to only prove that. I suspect the problem is significantly overstated - it is relevant, but I feel it is overblown and then results in us asking 'how can we do more?'

The product of which could be that we're driving the benchmarks too high. That is what I meant, 'we' as a society, not as an individual. We expect everyone to be equally capable, whilst we also go on about diversity of experience and knowledge. In the past this didn't matter as manual jobs did not require an individual to be as skilled as modern employment does, and as a result today this is flagged up a lot more as the people who don't have these skills aren't finding employment and are flagged up easier. We're looking to assess these individuals for employment and find they can't do it. 50 years ago they would never have been assessed and would have been in a job. 

I'm not saying you're wrong for wanting to improve education. I've been saying that for a while, but I think it is worth considering that taking the angle of standards dropping is stating that education is deteriorating, and that seems too simplistic and places the blame on the teachers. There's a lot of factors to take into account as to how we could improve education, there's a lot of interesting talks I've seen. Over the years things will change, that is unavoidable. I do feel though that any discussion on education should avoid 'blame'.

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"This isn't a new strategy. It's an expansion of an old one.

Let me explain.

Until about two years ago, I was unemployed. During that time I was collecting JSA for roughly three years, once per year I would be sent on a course, all three times I was sent to report in to a company called Action 4 Employment who, to their credit, seemed to be at least marginally interested in finding people work. Each ""course"" was thirteen weeks long (my Advisor person said that the intervals shortened the more you were claiming, and the courses could be up to one year long. Some people that were claiming thousands were on these courses constantly, it WAS their job) The first two weeks of these courses would be us looking for work while the A4E employees would find us ""job trials""

In short, these were periods of unpaid work for a company that may or may not be looking for new employees.

My first stint was with some tiny-ass surveying company.

The second was with the Civil Freakin' Service, working at Riverside House of all places. A4E was a stone's throw from their offices.

The third was at Matalans.

Matalans do love their free labour. They eventually hired me but only to decide to instantly screw me over in different ways.

The point, however, is that for almost two months a minimum of maybe thirty people per ""course"" (and A4E's HQ in Woolwich is easily large enough to have maybe thirty or fourty of these courses going at once, as it is in a two-part building split down the middle) it meant that you had, every two month, some six hundred people doing unpaid work from just one location. There is another in Lewisham and they're probably dotted around the country, all implimenting the same practices, every two months each one gets a few hundred pairs of hands to fawn off to whomever they see fit regardless of their actual chances of finding work. These were not part time hours either, the minimum amount of time I spent at any one of those three jobs was eight hours, and I had no reason to believe it was any different for anyone else. We paid for our own travel and food, and if we didn't show up to work or objected, we got our money cut.

While I admit it did help me find work, and while I admit the plan has some beneficial points, it relies on the companies not just making use of the free labour. Before being unemployed I was an entry level civil servant at the DVLA HQ in Sidcup. I had a reference from an Area Secretary. After working at Riverside House, I went back for an interview a few months later to find that one of the people I had worked with was conducting it. Even though she knew me, knew I was a hard worker and even though I had a reference from someone way above her station, I didn't get the job. To them, I was not a worker, I was free labour and nothing more.

This plan was always going to happen, however it needs to be more focussed. It needs to be implimented not on the wide basis that it is, but used to get the idle back into work as best as it can. Some people, despite being idle, found work through this system, but would show up at the next course a year later because they nabbed a tax-free paycheck and then just stopped showing up, or decided they didn't want to commute that day, or whatever.

It needs to be used as a punishment, not as a mandatory practice.",0,1329418903,null,0,false,0,c3rwrih,t3_ps5si,t1_c3rwrih,t3_ps5si,null,1428365734,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I am generally comparing my skills and those of those I studied and worked with when I left school as a bit of a drop out in the 1980s.

I am no genius - I am slightly Dyslexic and struggle with spelling (thank goodness for spell check as a replacement for the dictionary!), and can do basic maths, but would probably hesitate with long division.

How is it that average people of my generation left school able to do basic maths and read basic books - and today if you try to recruit someone from school, they struggle with basic skills.

To repeat - I am not talking about changing workplaces, or technology, or anything that is different today from 1980s, 1950s, 1920s etc.

If kids today struggle to do something as basic as work out what 10% of something is - then something is wrong. Seriously wrong.

As to blame - if we can't figure out who is to blame, how do we kick them out and get in a better replacement? Either ""the system"", individual teachers, whatever - find the fault, and get rid of it.

Could you not concoct a straw man argument against me then use it to tell me that my supposed philosophy is scary?

&gt;Eh? Ron Paul is getting more than 20% of the vote consistently in loads of states. He hit almost 40% in Maine and it's likely he could have won the state

But he didn't, ""weird shenanigans"" not withstanding. It doesn't matter what % of the vote he'll get because it operates under a first past the post system. He will not win any states. He will not be the presidential candidate. Why should a UK TV show be obliged to feature him? There is only so much time in any report- it would be much better spent discussing a candidate that has won states and has a chance in greater detail.

If he decides to run as a third party candidate then I expect that there will be a good deal of coverage, because he will be *participating in the election*. As it currently stands, he is not, and will not be.

Many of these people are and were tax payers.  You don't give up your citizenship just because you lose your job.  We are a society, a community not just a bunch of selfish and greedy machines fighting over who gets of the biggest pile of money.

&gt;Take two groups of people, one who is unemployed and the other group isn't.

Fine, I choose arts grads with 2:2s from wealthy families, who were handed lucrative positions during an economic boom and nursing or teaching grads with 1sts from poor backgrounds, who graduated during a depression and couldn't find work.

&gt;You can be sure that on the average the former group is more likely to be the type who doesn't want to work.

Bullshit.  Many unemployed people have been actively searching for work for years now.  You can't find what isn't there.  The nature of the benefits system means they are forced to.  During a recession there are fewer jobs though.  It's simple arithmetic.

&gt;if you are a lazy person OF COURSE you will be more likely to be in the group on welfare duh.

There are plenty of lazy people with jobs.

&gt;Stop pretending to be an economist.

Ouch.  The irony hit me like an obese t-rex.  You should warn people before doing that.
