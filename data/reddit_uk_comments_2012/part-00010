As far as I can tell, the majority here agree that the BBC and other free-to-air channels should be carried free of charge. The main thing we disagree on is whether they are worth paying something for. I would argue that the BBC channels in particular, are. And if, as you say, they are only there for convenience, you have to ask whose convenience are we talking about? Why the convenience of Sky and their customers of course! 

And to argue that they don't add value to their packages is disingenuous at best. If they don't add value to their packages, then why do they [advertise their availability – particularly the HD channels – as a selling point](http://www.sky.com/shop/tv/entertainment-packs/entertainment-extra/)?",0,1327763962,null,0,false,0,c3lik1k,t3_p0d8v,t1_c3lik1k,t1_c3lie1a,null,1428254866,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Licence fee payers who also pay Sky subscriptions and don't want to have another box just to be able to record the BBC alongside the Sky box for everything else. Not everyone has the hardware for Freeview HD but might have a Sky HD box, too.

&gt; Why the convenience of Sky and their customers of course!

Who make up a rather large number of the total number of licence fee payers, and who also pay for the BBC through licence fees. They're not exclusive groups. People who pay the TV licence may or may not pay Sky, but those who pay Sky are almost totally going to be paying the BBC too (it'd be illegal to do otherwise).


&gt; then why do they [1] advertise their availability – particularly the HD channels – as a selling point?

They don't. It quite clearly states that BBC HD and other free-to-air channels don't require a subscription and that some require a card (which is also not a subscription). They may list them because they are available through Sky's hardware, but it doesn't really seem like they're using it as a selling point.

From counting the "" 31 HD channels‡ to enjoy"" **do not** include the free channels (which includes the BBC).

This point is made further still if you expand ""What HD channels are available with the Entertainment Packs?"" - no BBC or other free HD channels listed.

Sky doesn't derive any direct profit from the BBC being available on its hardware, so there is no reason why it should be forced to pay for it to be there. At the very least the BBC should be expected to pay the costs incurred by Sky to make it available with no profit (probably a lot less than £10m).",0,1327764228,null,0,true,0,c3likzd,t3_p0d8v,t1_c3likzd,t1_c3lik1k,null,1428254879,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

What about those of us who don't use Freeview? I don't. But my licence fee subsidises the costs of transmitting it for those who do. I'm not complaining about however much Arqiva are paid to do it. I don't use DAB either, because it's shit, but many people do. I'm paying for them too.

What about those who don't use iPlayer, and are paying for those who do? Some people still aren't on the Internet or don't care for iPlayer.

Subsidy happens in multiple directions. It isn't just for Sky box users (***not just subscribers*** - as a lot of people don't pay a Sky subscription but still use a Sky box to watch free channels). Am I subsidising the way you choose to watch the BBC? Probably.

&gt; The blurb clearly states "" …, plus six free to air HD channels…"" and shows the icons for those HD channels amongst the 37 shown below.

You're the one being disingenuous by stating that they're using it as a selling point. They quite clearly tell you that only 31 channels are part of the package, and then go on to say that a few more are not part of the package but you can receive them anyway.

This page - http://www.sky.com/products/tv-packs/entertainment-extra/ - doesn't even mention those channels - only the 31 that you actually pay for.

&gt; The fact that they are also available without subscription is neither here nor there, they've added them to the list of what subscribers will get.

It's very relevant. They have made it clear that it is not part of the subscription and that's the only reason you can receive them. Of course subscribers are going to get them too - because they're ""free""! But they don't hide the fact that they are free and try to pass them off as part of the package.

What do you mean? That's why DVB-T (which is partially aka Freeview) is replacing it. Those who can't get it now will probably be able to get it once analogue is switched off in their area.

I think ""platform neutrality"" is relaxed when it comes to analogue TV. There's a massive technical reason as to why it can't do interactive TV or multiscreens, and besides it's a dying platform. It's the kinds of things that analogue can't do that made digital TV so much more compelling in the first place, so it wouldn't make much sense to kneecap digital TV's innovation just to make it fairer for analogue viewers.

Among the three main digital TV platforms there is less reason to not be equal - and as I have said the BBC has often downgraded a service on Sky/Virgin to make it the same as Freeview which has the most capacity restrictions.

As for your first link, it sounds like some of what they plan to bring to Virgin already existed on Sky/Freeview or would have happened anyway (the Olympics stuff).

As for the second point it sounds like it's a good thing that the BBC has finally relaxed its restrictions.

Depends on the chapter and verse of the actual regulation. It may be that the BBC has to be available, not just ""we've made an effort and they aren't playing ball"".

As you probably know the BBC (with ITV) created Freesat whose EPG is deliberately made to be proprietary and implements a basic ""encryption"" scheme to try and stop third parties (and the likes of MythTV developers) reverse engineering it. It hasn't worked (third party implementations are available), iirc, but they aren't transmitting a standard DVB EPG even for Freesat viewers. They also charge fees via Freesat for the same services that Sky is charging the BBC and others for. The BBC isn't the ""good guy"" that some people want to make them out to be.

(also IIRC Sky's system is so horribly proprietary (and predates DVB's ability to do more than now/next) that it would take massive re-engineering on Sky's part to be fully DVB compliant, as well as probably tons of hardware replacement at broadcasters and homes to make that unreasonable for Sky to do just because the BBC had a hissy fit)",0,1327766982,null,0,false,0,c3livp1,t3_p0d8v,t1_c3livp1,t1_c3litfm,null,1428255021,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Freeview and the iPlayer are freely available to everyone in the UK with a licence, so I don't see how they can be described as being subsidised. If you didn't have Sky you wouldn't have to pay any extra to get either of those services.

Doesn't matter. As I keep repeatedly stating, **you do not need to be a Sky subscriber to fall into the category of benefiting from the BBC being on Sky.** You can buy a Sky box on ebay/car boot sale for a few quid, plug it into a dish and you can watch the BBC without paying Sky a penny. Some people do this because Freesat boxes are nowhere near as cheap and Freeview is unavailable or unsuitable.

Also, you *do* have to pay for Freeview and iPlayer. For Freeview that might be a box and antenna (oh, what, the same as my example above for Sky, you mean?!!?!!?), for iPlayer that's a computer and internet connection (a recurring cost, like a Sky subscription, except that I actually need the internet connection for iPlayer whereas I do not need a Sky subscription for the BBC on Sky).

&gt; As for what they pay Arqiva for aerial transmissions: well, notwithstanding my view that the transmission assets should never have been split from the BBC in the first place, it isn't really the same thing because they're not a rival that broadcasts its own channels in the same way Sky are. I don't understand your last bit, the fact that Sky broadcasts its own channels is of no relevance here.

The BBC would still have to pay for transmission. Even if it owned its transmitters, it wouldn't get the infrastructure, electricity and expertise for free. That's a cost which non-Freeview using BBC licence fee payers would still be subsidising even if they don't use it. 

&gt; Well what the hell is [2] this 

I clearly missed that as I skimmed through it, but once again it states that it is ""free to air"" - which you do not need to pay a subscription for.

I think between Essien and Meireles can cover that position, but unfortunately neither, not even Essien, can hop right in and play like Ramires. The thing is though, if were looking to buy someone who can deputize the position better than one of them (there aren't many available) then we are gonna be overstocked  in the future.

We might as well let Essien and Meireles cover but we should definitely be looking at signing another midfielder for reinforcements. Ramires was our energy, our spark. We probably wont find someone who has the speed and stamina but we need to find someone who is gonna make plays and lift the team up. If he is going to be out for 2-3 months and we don't make any signings...we could easily miss out on 4th place. We've look dreadful without his energy this season.

I think we should be looking at Jovetic, Gaston Ramirez, Willian, maybe Moutinho.

We could also consider changing shape, and bring in an attacking player. It sounds a little drastic to change the whole system over 1 player but this season Ramires has been keeping the whole system alive.

Not everyone who watches via Sky (who are subscribers or otherwise) live in places that don't have Freeview. My Freeview coverage is so good that I can stick my finger in the aerial socket and get reception (the transmitter is visible from my house). But as I said I don't watch via Freeview.

So Freeview coverage figures are irrelevant.

&gt; but what I clearly meant was you don't have to pay any extra for it like you do for other services, like Netflix for example.

Neither do you for Sky (without a subscription) - at least it's no worse than Freeview, which depending on your TV may require a box and depending on area, it might require a new aerial or an upgrade to it. With Sky (non subscription) all you need is a box and a dish.

&gt; The cost of transmitting always used to be part and parcel of the licence fee, and there's nothing wrong with that. 

The ""cost of transmitting"" in 2012 also includes the costs of getting channels onto EPGs. Whether the fee is proportionate or justified or necessary. I don't think the BBC should be paying £10m (sounds like there's a lot of profit for Sky for not too much work) but I don't think the BBC should be paid by Sky either.

You appear to be suggesting that it's perfectly fine for people to subsidise Freeview (which may be the way you watch the BBC) transmission, but not for others to subsidise the fees necessary to get onto Sky for the millions who probably watch and record that way, who may or may not be Sky subscribers. I fail to see why there is any difference. 

&gt; I know someone else has pointed out that some suppliers do pay ""slotting fees"" to get their products onto supermarket shelves

The BBC doesn't actually pay to be in prime positions on Sky's programme guide - that is, it doesn't pay specifically for 101/102. Sky isn't allowed to do anything with those slots other than give them to the BBC (and same for 103/4/5 for ITV/4/5).

Maybe a better compromise, if the BBC somehow deserves special treatment (perhaps all of the public service channel should get it), is for it to pay whatever costs Sky actually incurs for making the BBC available on its EPG (and ancillary services like interactivity), which is probably nowhere near £10m.

Quite possibly - but that wasn't my point. Signing up *because* the BBC is available, and taking advantage of its presence are two different things. The BBC's presence is expected on Sky, these days, it's not a selling point or a major deal breaker.

If the BBC were disappear from Sky, apart from the platform neutrality argument I made above, then those people wonder why they're paying the licence fee for a channel they may not be able to receive (not everyone has an aerial, or their TVs set up for Freeview).

&gt; If they couldn't watch/record BBC through their Sky box it would be pretty inconvenient for them since they need a secondary DVR and an aerial hookup.

Exactly. But that only makes my argument stronger. Why would someone deliberately move away from Sky (and the channels they're paying for that they clearly wanted to watch) to the likes of Freeview (which for a lot of the country is the only alternative and has almost none of the channels that are on Sky) strictly because of BBC availability.

true,Ziggamorph,null,null,"&gt;The BBC's presence is expected on Sky, these days, it's not a selling point or a major deal breaker.

Once again, I'm going to say I think you're wrong. If we set aside the whole legal issue, lets imagine the BBC stops paying Sky. What would Sky do? I cannot imagine they'd remove BBC channels from their EPG. They'd be inundated with complaints and would be forced to quickly restore them.

&gt;If the BBC were disappear from Sky, apart from the platform neutrality argument I made above, then those people wonder why they're paying the licence fee for a channel they may not be able to receive (not everyone has an aerial, or their TVs set up for Freeview).

That's not really the BBC's fault. The BBC aren't paying Sky to broadcast their channels over satellite, only to be included in their EPG. BBC satellite transmissions are unencrypted and I presume include EPG data (since that's required for Freesat). In other words, the BBC wouldn't be discriminating against people who can't get Freeview.

&gt;Exactly. But that only makes my argument stronger. Why would someone deliberately move away from Sky (and the channels they're paying for that they clearly wanted to watch) to the likes of Freeview (which for a lot of the country is the only alternative and has almost none of the channels that are on Sky) strictly because of BBC availability.

I don't follow. My point is that if you could no longer watch BBC channels through Sky boxes, most people *would* go to the effort of making alternative arrangements because most people do want BBC channels.",0,1327780561,null,0,false,0,c3lkr8x,t3_p0d8v,t1_c3lkr8x,t1_c3lk3s1,null,1428255969,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Admittedly a smaller issue, but Sky had no problem at all taking its channels off of Virgin for several months because the contract expired and negotiations failed.

&gt; BBC satellite transmissions are unencrypted and I presume include EPG data (since that's required for Freesat). In other words, the BBC wouldn't be discriminating against people who can't get Freeview.

Freesat uses its own proprietary EPG data stream, so only (nominally at least) licenced Freesat hardware is able to decrypt it. Only the video streams are unencrypted. I have some bog-standard DVB-S hardware and doing anything other than basic watching is a chore - unless I want to set manual recordings, VCR style (yeah we used to do that, but we're in 2012 now and EPGs are what people want).

It is still discrimination against the millions of people who have Sky hardware and used to be able to receive the BBC and now can't. Being told to ""Buy a Freesat box or use Freeview"" is an unacceptable compromise - unless the BBC is willing to supply boxes of like-for-like capability to what they have now.

You may be able to tune in the BBC channels manually but that too is unacceptable because you cannot record those channels, there is minimal EPG data, no interactivity, etc.

&gt; I don't follow. My point is that if you could no longer watch BBC channels through Sky boxes, most people would go to the effort of making alternative arrangements because most people do want BBC channels.

Sky receives revenue for their channels being on Virgin (like it receives revenue from EPG fees). Sky happily forewent that revenue (like it might be willing to do if the BBC stopped paying) for as long as it took to renegotiate a contract (or until the BBC decided to stop the petulance).

Anti-Sky attitude, then? Like it or not rather a lot of people will have only one DVR, and that DVR is likely to have a Sky logo on it. The expectation is that the BBC will make itself available on Sky, not for Sky to capitulate to the BBC.

ITV might have similarly eye-watering fees, because the bulk of the £10m is in things like paying for interactivity (which ITV does, I think) and regionality (so you get the right BBC/ITV regions for the postcode that you live in). That's the impression I got from skimming Sky's price list.

Since most shopping or phone-a-tart channels don't need either of this (although QVC has interactive IIRC) it'll be a lot less. Although IIRC different fees are charged for shopping, adult and (I think) gambling channels vs. general entertainment channels - probably because those types of channels get more revenue and adult channels need more protection (PIN/age restriction and whatnot).",0,1327783507,null,0,true,0,c3ll6u1,t3_p0d8v,t1_c3ll6u1,t1_c3lij55,null,1428256174,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

That is the great debate. The regeneration cycles are always handwaved in some sense. Melody only has part Time Lord DNA, but is able to regenerate fully, though she developed more or less in the time vortex. On the other hand, Melody was conditioned to being the perfect weapon against the Doctor, which means using her regeneration cycle to its full potential. Jenny is pure Time Lord from a genetics standpoint, and was suitably brainwashed into wanting to die for a cause. It stands to reason, like the Master, she could have subconsciously stopped her regeneration cycle until the last moment. While it may have been a red herring, they did keep on showing us the Doctor's hand from his previous regeneration cycle, to at least get us to think that it is possible for Jenny to regenerate. As to why the Doctor can not gleam her presence, it could do with an innate Time Lord ability to ignore versions of themselves so they do not cross into their own time stream, well as best as possible.

Needless to say, it is suitably vague that both sides of the Jenny camp can argue that there is enough evidence shown in the episode to support their theory.

&gt;All it would suggest is that the BBC somehow thinks it is deserving of special treatment.

But there *is* a difference between the BBC and the bullshit channels that populate the top of the guide. Those channels need Sky. The BBC does not need Sky.

&gt;Sky receives revenue for their channels being on Virgin (like it receives revenue from EPG fees). Sky happily forewent that revenue (like it might be willing to do if the BBC stopped paying) for as long as it took to renegotiate a contract (or until the BBC decided to stop the petulance).

You have it backwards again! Sky forewent *revenue* but they did not actually irritate their own customers. They irritated Virgin's customers. Sky has its cake and eats it—it gets the programming from the BBC that its customers want, and the BBC also for some reason has to pay for it. It'd be like if I charged Royal Mail money to deliver letters to my house.

&gt;Maybe in the wondrous place that is Cambridge, you could move to Virgin (to get the BBC and pay-TV channels on one box), but huge amounts of the country do not have that privilege. Virgin is the only pay-TV company worth signing up to that isn't Sky.

This is completely irrelevant. To reiterate, it would be Sky losing out by dropping the BBC, not the BBC.

I live in the north of Edinburgh. I have to change buses and my usual bus route takes about 45 minutes - it doesn't run early enough for 9am lectures, though.

I do know some other students (including one postgrad student) in my area, and the rent tends to be around £200-300 incl. everything around here if you rent a room with a family, so that's a good reason to go for the longer commute and possible babies in the flat. A lot of people also live in Gorgie - it's more expensive, but cheaper than halls and about 20 minutes from uni.

Honestly, as long as you live along the 25 bus route you're golden and along the 34 is also okay; everything else is manageable, too. 


Also, as mentioned before, go through Gumtree. If you want cheap, look for Asian families renting out rooms. It's fairly common in some parts of the city and while you'll have to screen for the really conservative types, it's cool.

Actually, I'm moving out of my room in May; if you want you can contact me for details.

In financial terms, you're right,  because it has a guaranteed income. That doesn't mean that the BBC doesn't need to fulfill its obligations to be platform neutral - and that involves being on Sky due to its dominance (and why it pays the fees that are set with Ofcom's agreement)

&gt; You have it backwards again! Sky forewent revenue but they did not actually irritate their own customers. They irritated Virgin's customers. 

You're missing the point. Sky was quite happy to let go of the revenue. That's what matters - money. They don't care about pissing off their own or others' customers if it means more money and more profit. Look at the constant subscription increases that affect their own customers for evidence of that. Yet their number of customers doesn't drop appreciably, and they continue to make tons of money.

&gt; Sky has its cake and eats it—it gets the programming from the BBC that its customers want, and the BBC also for some reason has to pay for it. 

Sky ""gets nothing"" from the BBC. It does not get the programming - I don't see Strictly Come Dancing, Eastenders or Top Gear on Sky One. It doesn't get any revenue from the BBC being on its platform, so why should it pay anything to the BBC? It mostly makes things convenient for licence-fee payers who have Sky and want to record/watch everything on one PVR.

The BBC is paying for another outlet for its content, at the same market rates as every single other channel who uses the Sky platform, many of which do not get paid by Sky. Why should the BBC get special treatment because of who they are? 

I think some of the fees charged by Sky are a bit excessive but with a £4 billion guaranteed income, £10m to reach a lot of your licence fee payers (and allow them to use the equipment they own to access the services they pay for) is not much. Get rid of a few of the overpaid ""talent"" instead.

&gt; It'd be like if I charged Royal Mail money to deliver letters to my house.

RM would tell you to swivel and either deliver the post anyway or no post at all. Sky would tell the BBC to go swivel too, but it's just so unlikely that they'd lose a lot of their customers over it. It would look worse for the BBC - since they're the ones who would be deciding to discontinue paying - not Sky, who are willing to provide the service if it is paid for and where the BBC happily paid it for years and suddenly decided not to.

You seem to think that the BBC is the be all and end all, and that customers only pay Sky just because they can watch the BBC. If that was the case they'd all be out buying Freeview/Freesat PVRs instead of paying Sky. But there must be *some* reason why people subscribe...

&gt; This is completely irrelevant. To reiterate, it would be Sky losing out by dropping the BBC, not the BBC. If you can't get it into your head that Sky is the one who is the only one benefiting from this arrangement then I don't have anything more I can say to you

It isn't irrelevant at all - some people have the option of moving to Virgin to retain the same service that they have now - a single DVR to record the BBC and other channels. Others do not - because Freeview is not really an alternative to Sky.

&gt;WHEN John Henry and Tom Werner were informed about Liverpool FC’s interest in Stewart Downing last summer they turned to the internet to find out more.
&gt;
&gt;The Reds’ principal owner and chairman stumbled across a video on YouTube which grabbed their attention.
&gt;
&gt;“There was some footage of Stewart where he is, from 30 yards away, kicking a football into five different trash cans and it’s brilliant,” Werner recalled.
&gt;
&gt;“John and I said: ‘Oh my god, this player is brilliant, we’ve got to figure out a way to make a deal with him’.”
&gt;
&gt;The American duo later discovered the footage had been doctored but the excitement at Downing’s arrival remained.
&gt;
&gt;There were plenty of other genuine videos showing the England international wreaking havoc last season. He was Aston Villa’s player of the year, scoring eight goals and chipping in with a similar number of assists.

true,Admiral_Bison,,Belfast,"&gt;in the village they hate catholics more than the Westboro's hate the gays

Ok, look, I do respect some of the issues you've raised on this one, but I have to really take issue with the above quoted comment.

I worked in the Village for 6 months in a local Community group - I can assure you this element is a small one and it's totally wrong to assume that all of those living in the Village 'hate Catholics'. Firstly,  I AM Catholic, a fact that was well known by the many locals I worked with, and by those around the area. Secondly, I have had friends with VERY catholic names and accents who have lived in the area and never been bothered once. The negative element that purported these acts, are young men (and perhaps women) whipped up into frenzies by a tight fisted criminal element that still unfortunately exists there. The Village area has been an area that has been passed over for refurbishment and assistance for their school children again and again due to the assumptive attitudes that they are nothing but a bunch of bigots living in the past - the vast majority are decent people who don't want anything to do with the terrorist stranglehold that still exists there... and I'm sorry to say that that stranglehold is very alive and very well.

The second thing I have to challenge in the above is make an allusion to 'working class unionism' as if that's the route of these attitudes and violence. That is not only desperately classist, but again, as someone who has worked in politics for a number of years, I can assure you some of the darkest, most violent perpetrators I've come across have been those born with silver spoon. Money doesn't mean you can't be a vicious asshole - often quite the opposite.

Finally, the video re the UUP guy - Neill McNickle - I really agree that this guy was trying to sound educated on purpose. I watched the video a few times and I thought his articulation was pretty natural on him. He was worked up and upset about this guy, McNickle being dismissive about what seemed to be a random attack and trying to blame a victim. He didn't deny that there could have been more at play at any time - he only indicated that it was fairly unlikely, and that to compromise the young man's integrity on speculation based on very little (and really only to shit stir as politicians do) was not only highly offensive but it has (and always has had) a much greater impact on Northern Ireland youth at large. I empathized a lot with this guy's feelings - I found his anger to be something I connected with. He allowed himself to be pretty upset and was honest about himself. If you did find him to be perhaps a little tryhardy, fair enough, but he's young and currently getting to know himself - make allowance for that. I don't remember any particular 'long words' he used, but why does that make him so unlikable, or a prick? 

He also made a pretty pregnant point re: Young people not wanting to return here because they're sick to the teeth with this political BS. I can't not agree with his speaking out, or his anger. Your apathy is what worries me more about our future than his anger if I'm really honest. We shouldn't allow politicians to fuck with us on an international scale like this - while working in politics, I had a LARGE, international event coming together... an event routinely held in Greece that had decided for the first time in 20 odd yrs to relocate to NI as a one off. However, there was a car bomb, politicians acting like assholes, and then [another UUP rep, Basil McCrea, claimed on the radio that Dissident Republican's had the same weapon strength as the IRA at their peak, and disaster was on the horizon for us all](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-11741503) - I can tell you that I was assured this was total bollocks, but it didn't matter - it scared the crap out of the event organisers and we lost a 1000 plus award ceremony that would have brought a VERY desperately needed cash injection into the economy....

The point is, if we don't challenge these fearmoungering fuckers, the cycle never ENDS. They get votes by whipping up peoples fears and then telling them if they vote for X they'll be protected. Our parents and grandparents remember the source of these fears - but we don't. So many young people are either indoctrinated or buy into this crap our politician's are spewing. This not only makes those of us like this guy in this youtube video, and people like me want to throw in the towel with frustration and move out - but it also makes us look like violent idiots to the rest of the world, which damages our economy and scare away talent and tourism. 

I think we should commend this guy for speaking out - not condemning him. He may not have used the right language, or even articulated himself in the best way - but his message wasn't flawed. Don't condemn the victim, and don't perpetrate a conspiracy that doesn't exist, and if you're a politician (or at least trying to be one, depending on your viewpoint) will you fucking realise who and what your representing, the weight of responsibility on your shoulders and try to be goddamn constructive - and if you can't do any of that, take a good, hard look at yourself and then step the fuck down.

It isnt the rich prods or the middle class ones putting up flags, marching down the queens highway or burning their own areas or generally being bigoted.. tis only the areas like the village, council estates and **generally** shitty places that 'loyalism'/orangism/unionism thrives.  The fact remains that the majority of the non-working class areas have no painted kerb stones and are FAR FAR FAR more mixed than the areas that i'm talking about above... so yes, it is classist, but I still believe that 9times out of 10 i'm right.  I can accept what you're saying that its not 100% that way, things are never black and white, but we cannot let the odd rogue piece of outlying data skew the trends.

You are right about politicians, its their job to keep the population scared.. primarily to keep themselves getting re-elected.  And I am not saying this guy shouldnt have spoken out.. but i fear that he wasnt speaking out of some neutral stand point, I dont believe he is even slightly neutral..    I'm guessing from your posts you would rather, much like myself, that we could all just get along and get over the past 800 years, I believe that the majority of my peers are the same, we just dont give a fuck... people like us should take a stand and speak out.
I dont think this guy was the same, I believed (and i cant re-watch it again to change my mind) that he was out to be political and score points, frightening people to what the big bad huns are capable of.  No better way to do that than to be just a few degrees off neutral, to the point of quite possibly shit-stirring in the opposite direction.

I dont really know what it was about him that made me think he was a prick, the trying to sound educated didnt help, personally I cant stand that, people who are educated dont often try and use the longest word they can find when a suitable one is available that is simpler.  I just got that gut feeling as soon as he started that really he was a tryhard prick.

Funny thing is that if we boil down what he's saying, I guess we all more or less agree.

In terms of my apathy, yeah you're probably right, I believe this country is fucked.  The future is grim and I think it'll get a lot worse in the years ahead.  But i've spoken to enough of these numbskulls to realise that they are so anti-intellectual, illogical, ignorant and stubborn that you will NEVER change their minds.  I would probably leave here if it wasn't for having parents living here, who I want my kids to see.

If you think the episodes from 2005 onwards are inconsistent, there is an entire *book* called *The Discontinuity Guide*, which looks at plot inconsistencies during the classic era of the show, from BCE (Before Christopher Eccleston) 1963 up to 1989. 

So yes, watching 9, 10 and 11 is not really catching up. Think about it this way: the Earth was burned by the sun in ""The End of the World"" (2005). In the *Doctor Who* universe alone, that's the fourth time the Earth was toasted, and each story contradicts the others. They're not four takes on the same story, they're four completely different stories.

That's inconsistency. Sure, you can explain it by wibbley-wobbley, timey-wimey, or whatever phrase Steven Moffat uses when he has writer's block, but that's what happens when you've got a show about time travel that gets a new writing team every few years.

I'm not sure if this is what you meant by some of the episodes being inconsistent, but your comment made me think that the iceberg I was thinking of is much, much bigger than what you had in mind.

IMO Malouda makes a very solid left winger. Might not be the paciest, but he certainly can hold that position down with great crosses and ability to keep possession. Mata is also a great attacking midfielder with his tricky runs and play making ability.

With Ramires out of the picture for a few weeks, I really hope Torres will score. Often times when watching the game I see Ramires drifting into Torres' position forcing Torres out wide. Every game there seems to be a play where a pass to Torres would be perfect but Ramires decides to shoot instead.

true,richunclesam,null,null,"Yeah, those are all additional ways for a character to return in *any* science fiction show.  Star Trek did each of those on various occasions.  

The point that I was paraphrasing from Halefor, in order to simplify the expression of the point (apparently pointlessly, since I'm now expanding on it) was that, when a show is *about time travel*, there's no reason why we can't later revisit a character, the *same instance* of the *same character* as opposed to different, identical-looking alternatives such as clones and alternate universe versions, at a different point in time.

River is the classic example: It has been made crystal clear that the future appearances of River Song are in fact the same character, at earlier points in *her* life.  Not AU, not clones, but *her*.  Even though she was killed off on the very first serial she appeared in.  

This has been done a few times with the Doctor but not as a routine matter.  For instance, we've seen ""past incarnations"" of the Doctor come up in each ""The *n* Doctors"" storyline, usually via plot devices specifically contrived just to give fans a treat by seeing old actors return.  River is the only character with whom this has been a really routine event, but it's also been done occasionally with other characters, such as when the Doctor visited Rose during *The End of Time* at a point in her timeline before she ever met him.  And of course there is the Season Six with plot points being seen by the characters and the viewers out of order, although that's not really for the purpose of ""bringing back"" any characters as much as to tell a reasonably convoluted story and to sustain suspense.  

The second Romana was somewhat a different case altogether... Romana was forced to regenerate for the same production reason as the Doctor, to continue the character after an actor's departure.  I'm pretty sure they were looking for an excuse to get Lalla Ward onto the show as she was at the time romantically involved with Tom Baker.  They wrote in a clever rationale for her looking like Astra, not so much as an excuse to bring back the character but as an explanation to fans for having the same actress play two different roles.  Although I'm glad she did; she was one of my favorite companions.  The Romana technique could certainly be applied to Jenny, River, the Master, or even the Doctor, since they all could regenerate; although in the case of Jenny, I think that most fans would like to see both the actress and the character return.

And its not that your cause would benefit many people, perhaps the existence of a weekly travel card is because the vast majority of users do travel 7 days a week. TFL probably has quite detailed stats on it, since the Oyster system was introduced. 

In a way it feels like you're being incredibly greedy. The weekly travel card already costs only 3.5 day passes, which seems like a big enough discount as it is. Only you're not satisfied.

My friend doesn't watch TV on sundays because they usually go out and do other stuff instead. Should they have a special TV license just for them which is cheaper because they don't watch TV one day a week?

So why wouldn't the so called ""chosen one"" want to prove he can win something without buying it in the best league in the world with a team which is already showing huge promise and massive potential, maybe just maybe he could become a legend and win something big with us like he did with Porto.

I think where we see that most is in the episode ""Night Terrors"" where he's trying to explain himself to George's dad. 

   The Character is just beautiful. Now, as much as I love the Pond's, I've grown tired of the whole story line. I want more random adventures of the Doctor and a new (preferably fun, but would top Amy) companion. More episodes like ""Blink"" would be amazing with Smith. An example of this would be the AMAZING Christmas Specials we have had. I really want to see Captain Jack again. I believe the exchange there would be quite hilarious.

true,widgetas,null,null,"I can see where you're coming from, but the CoE is, I think, a special case in all of this to an extent. While a church can, understandably, turn a couple away from being married there if they are not the right religion etc. I do not think they can turn away a couple of any other reason. For example a mixed race couple could not be turned away *for being* mixed race (actually that is a fine example of how a religion could stand in the way of progress - although the UK is a slightly different case to the US where the race issue was a bit more pronounced, I have no doubt that there were instances of churches turned people away or refused to marry them back in the day). In a similar way I'm not sure that a church should be exempt from turning a gay couple away simply because they are gay, if they were to meet all the other usual selection criteria.

To allow otherwise would be to acknowledge and accept, in law, that some people do not deem homosexuality as 'OK'. Although religion already has loopholes in equality legislation, I don't think it should be allowed to continue.

I really can see the dilemma here, that people should be allowed to practice their religion as they see fit, but this isn't, as it were, an isolated case and it's not as though we can't look at past history to see how the church has resisted changes in societal values. Consider, as I've mentioned elsewhere, the attitude from the 1830's when the Marriage act was on the cards. The then Bishop of Exeter opposed the Act, as did most other clergy in the House of Lords and even at one point succeeded in amending the text so as to render it entirely pointless. The Act, passed in 1836, freed marriages from the condition that they *must* be performed by a CoE clergyman (excluding Jews &amp; Quakers) and recognised certain minority religious ceremonies and state performed marriage. Later that year, the Bishop said:

&gt; The Marriage Act is [""…a disgrace to British legislation. (It) is pretended to be called for to prevent clandestine marriages, but I think it will greatly facilitate such proceedings. Not solemnized by the church of England, may be celebrated without entering into a consecrated building, may be contracted by anybody, and will be equally valid, whether it takes place in the house of God, or in the house of a registering clerk, one of the lowest functionaries of the state. The parties may take one another for better and for worse, without calling God to witness their plighted troth. No blessing sought; no solemn vows of mutual fidelity; no religious solemnity whatever …""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act_1836)

It's a slightly different scenario than today, but the feeling is precisely the same: ""Marriage is ours and it should be performed the way *we* [the guys up top] want."" Remember this is the feeling of the hierarchy, not necessarily the feeling of the masses. Consider the proportion of the UK population that are in favour of gay marriage being recognised, then compare that to the number of religions people. Depending on who you ask (Church says *far* more people are interested in Christianity than reasonable estimates (i.e. the question was worded correctly) would have you believe) then there quite a large overlap of believers who are OK with gays being married, although we have to assume that they mean that can take place in their place of worship.

Personally I think it'd be a good idea to see congregations polled on their feelings rather than leaving it to the guys in charge - the higher up the ladder the more likely there is to be opposition, I think.",0,1327823879,null,0,false,0,c3lqlrn,t3_p0gsx,t1_c3lqlrn,t1_c3lourg,null,1428258726,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; 1) What body was burned? Not the robot suit, and not his. Did the companions not watch the body burn?

It was the robot body. The real Doctor mentioned that he was ""barely singed"" when he was still inside the robot as it burnt.

&gt; edited (2) 2) Where did the Churchill-imprisoned doctor get the marker for his forearm? 

I wondered this too. Could've been from Churchill's desk when they were in his office.

&gt; So, the failed first spacesuit kill of the doctor caused time to collapse by breaking a 'fixed point in time' and resulted in a 'timeloop' that froze time at 5:02. Although it's not explained how time could be frozen, but everybody is still moving around.
If time was frozen at 5:02, everything should be immobile. If it is not immobile, then time is moving. The premise of 'all times coming together' and frozen at 5:02 is complete blather. If you think even a bit about it, it would not work and not credible even in an SF framework. What, is all molecular motion going to stop so clocks are frozen? What happensto body chemistry?

Doctor Who isn't the first SF show to freeze time but allow characters to move around. I'm assuming you've been able to suspend your disbelief enough to follow Doctor Who up to this point, and a lot of this show requires handwaving in order to work. 

&gt; 3) what was the purpose of the top of pyramid scene aside from the marriage? Why did there have to be a marriage? Only to provide support for next season's action, I guess.

Most likely will be explained next season. Apparently, the marriage may or may not be valid, and River Song *still* needs to learn the Doctor's real name and be given his sonic screwdriver before she goes to the Library. Why would the Doctor say aloud that he told her his real name, when he in fact whispered ""Look into my eye""? Hopefully next season sheds some light on this scene.

&gt; 4) We have Silence the aliens, and Silence the religion. I must have missed why both have the same name.

The aliens are ""Silents"", the religion is ""Silence"". 

&gt; 5) how is it the Cybermen and the Daleks never noticed the Slience aliens?

The Silents are ""memory-proof"" meaning no living creature can remember them.

&gt; 6) Living skulls - how does that work, without mysticism?

Again, suspension of disbelief. This is something you need heavy doses of in order to enjoy this show.

&gt; 7) And how did the black Melanie manage to show up exactly when the doctor decides to show up in the cornfield a few episodes back?

Maybe the Silence set this up; they were heavily involved in her early life and she knew she was being trained to kill the Doctor.

&gt; 8) How did Amy live in that house all those years without parents and not get noticed? Yet she apparently mingled normally with Mel and Rory in her early school years.

Perception filter. Young Amy mentions that she lives with her aunt, which explains how bills are paid and how there's food in the fridge, etc.

&gt; 9) Remember when the very young Melanie appeared in a New York alley and then regenerated. Well, how did she get there, and then as a black child with no parents get to Scotland to go to school with Amy?

Again, the Silence was heavily involved in Melody's life. They obviously have time travel capabilities since they brought her back from Demon's Run to 1969. We don't see her after regenerating in 1969, so that could've been when she became Amy's childhood friend Mel; or since we've seen her regenerate from a young black woman (Mel) to an older white woman (River), it's possible she can control her age (she said she'd start aging backwards to freak people out after she emerges as River) when she regenerates and has had additional regeneration after 1969. We'll probably (hopefully) see this explained in Season 7.

&gt; The Moffat Who is all spectacle and melodrama but falls apart quickly upon introspection. Steven Moffat writes science-fantasy, not science fiction. The quintessential problem with science fantasy is it always depends on handwaving and even mysticism, whereas real science fiction, true SF. extrapolates from reality but adds in credible rational premises which it then builds upon. Moffat is good at coming up with spooky premises that are at base baloney. The Angels are good and creepy, but wholly noncredible as a premise, for example. Last season has flaws but this whole season was pure handwaving and broke credibility all the time.

We're talking about a show with a time traveling alien. His time machine is organic in nature and apparently sentient, makes use of a perception filter and can translate most languages and text (no matter where the characters are in relation to the TARDIS), and also happens to be bigger on the inside than the outside. I'll give you that Stephen Moffatt's writing has its flaws (I mainly agree with the article that the ending was a total cop out and was pretty disappointing), but I don't think you can fault Moffatt for excessive hand waving.",0,1327826889,null,0,false,0,c3lqvhl,t3_ky33o,t1_c3lqvhl,t1_c2o8quc,null,1428258853,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

If the landlord of a pub didn't want to change his business, his PROPERTY from the business model that was working perfectly well for them upto that point, why should the government FORCE a change on them? It's social engineering at it's finest. All the ban did, was *cost* businesses in revenue. 

I notice of course that you're still allowed to smoke in your own home, around whoever you like. If the government were doing it for health reasons, they'd be banning it there too (and infringe on more civil liberties in the process). It's not about health, it's about control.

true,pork2001,null,null,"A very nice set of explanations and thank you for the effort. Unfortunately, Moffat is a horrible writer at base, for resorting to science fantasy (the lazy writer's route) instead of science fiction writing rules (the hard route). He spoils it by premising ""oh, the doctor is alien future science so I can make up anything and the audience needs to swallow it. Because they are children, and stupid.'.

And he truly does resort to much too much handwaving and it really gets in the way. As I see it, he contrives a dramatic moment and then simply makes things up to justify the scene. Regardless of the holes this may create.  Good writing doesn't play that game. The result frequently ruins the suspension of disbelief, and I can't cognitively ignore it and sit back and let a lot of this stuff slide by. Suspension of disbelief does not mean adoption of stupidity. I have many bones to pick with him, and am accumulating notes for an essay or article. Mr. Moffat is dishonest with his audiences, and that sin is not forgivable.

And as for the time machine being organic, that broke canon, but was started by other writers. Nonetheless we've seen nothing but mysticism for a long time. Golden auras rising from a transforming doctor?  Magic vapors coming from the console?  These gentlemen have pulled this out of their asses, also breaking canon.  (Early in Tennant series: the doctor's hand is cut off by a sword and a new one pops out in a minute? Regeneration was life regeneration, not piece parts regeneration in all prior years. Because piece parts would have negated many of the dramatic perils.)  Martian aliens who take over a body and create firehoses of water out of nothing? (breaks chemistry and physics - turns into fantasy there) Magic space alien child who transforms people physically into grotesque puppets? All very poor writing.  Lazy writing. Wince worthy moments from both writers. Awful. But the whole last season from SM was slapdash and pure melodrama. I came away from most episodes insulted.

It acts as backstory for the 2005 series, just like there was obviously a backstory about the Doctor and Susan fleeing their home planet in 1963.  In both cases there was never any intent to put this on screen.  RTD wanted the character in a certain place, and wanted rid of the Time Lords, and the story of the Time War was a means to an end.

If you look back at RTD's run you can see it reveals information about the Time War in a very structured and measured way, culminating in as much infodump as we're ever likely to get in ""The End of Time"".  The Time War doesn't get mentioned until episode 3.  When that episode aired, there was some excited speculation that the Last Great Time War was the Time War depicted in the BBC Books, but as the series went on it became apparent these were irreconcilable, so if we follow the BBC Books continuity we have to assume Gallifrey was destroyed in the Ancestor Cell, restored somehow, and then destroyed again in *another* time war.

The Big Finish audio series ""Gallifrey"" sort of thematically leads in to the Time War, but there's no direct link.",0,1327836224,null,0,false,0,c3lr9nx,t3_p1hp1,t1_c3lr9nx,t3_p1hp1,null,1428259044,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3
true,animorph,null,null,"&gt;A dalek appears and every major character has a heart attack, as if they haven't defeated millions of them without much more effort than they put into other foes

Rose had to *absorb the Time Vortex* to defeat them previously, Donna had to create a Time Lord-Human hybrid to be within a remote chance, four Daleks, with no exaggeration, could have wiped out the Cybermen.

To be more specific, it is the Doctor who has managed to defeat them previously - not ordinary humans. Which is why they fear him.

They ARE frightening characters because of what they represent:

""Real life analogies quickly fail when applied to the Daleks. At times they're compared to the likes of Nazis, but in truth they're literally lacking in humanity. Even ""conquest"" as we generally understand the term doesn't really interest them - sometimes they put foes to work as slaves (as in Death to the Daleks), but this is almost inevitably in the interest of facilitating new atrocities and exterminations. The point is that one can (and should) hope to use reason against real-world governments, but there is virtually no chance of diplomacy succeeding against the Daleks. ... Basically, the Daleks collectively remain united behind one goal: kill everything that isn't a Dalek."" - [Lance Parkin](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Dalek)

&gt;But when all the characters start reacting in irrational ways to an un-scary villain I've seen way too many times

I wouldn't say it's irrational given the history of the Daleks - but they have been overused in recent times. Dalek-fatigue, certainly, but they are the Doctor's oldest and deadliest enemy. There is something unique about an enemy that spans the history of a show, and fifty years of history should not be discarded so freely, in my opinion. :)",0,1327836281,null,0,false,0,c3lr9ru,t3_p13xw,t1_c3lr9ru,t1_c3lnahc,null,1428259044,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Obviously there's a clear line between discipline and abuse. If your kid does something you don't like and you roundhouse kick him in the face as the anti-smacking league portray discipline to be, then yeah, you deserve to be prosecuted, but given children were smacked and whatnot for the majority of the last... well, bloody ages, and it worked out okay, I can't help but feel it's undermining the authority of parents to discipline unruly children for whom just saying ""no"" does not work.

We as a society want to blame parents for not bringing kids up correctly, but at the same time want to limit their ability to discipline their kids in fear of causing child abuse.

I personally advocate empowering the parents to be able to discipline their children as they see fit.

This is the guideline.  

The Sentencing Council produce guidelines, but do not alter statute.  It is still illegal to grow cannabis.

The guideline says that if an individual grows a small quantity of cannabis for personal consumption then they should expect to receive a sentence of between a conditional discharge and a community order, with a starting point of a fine.

The Sentencing Council's statistics (they use the Ministry of Justice's databases) show that fines and discharges are already common for this offence.  Presumably  where fines and discharges are given, they are for low level offenders (domestic operation for personal use, rather than the a more sophisticated commercial operation) http://sentencingcouncil.judiciary.gov.uk/docs/Analysis_and_Research_Bulletins_-_Drugs_Offences.pdf

The resource assessment says that there is no expectation of reductions in sentencing for cultivation offences.  In fact, it says that sentences may go up for this offence.

The UK (according to my teenage years more than a decade ago) seems to be stuck in extremes.   In the past, if kids misbehaved, you'd hit them.  Nowadays, the politically correct solution is to patronise the shit out of them.   There's very little feeling for a rebellious kid that you can do something to be proud of, and the resentment in an inflexible system just piles up.

To really address the problem of the lost youth, you need a structure in which they can learn self-respect, not just respect for the system that kicks them around.    There need to be apprenticeships and rewards for hard work - there has to be an incentive for them to get up in the morning instead of just dealing weed to their mates.

Of course, seeing as the government is cutting funding to all those kinds of programs, this problem is going to get much, much worse.    I guess hitting them is a cheaper solution.

It might be because of my age at the time, but back in the late 90's I remember programs like Equinox that were factually interesting, full of content and weren't... 'simple' (can't think of a better word, unless I say ""designed for the American market which could be insulting to US peeps around here!).

I remember years and years ago there was an hour long prog about Tsunamis and then about 5 years later a different show (I think on the same channel, 4) did another. That second one sticks out in my memory because it was the same content repeated over and over again for an hour. It could have been about 20mins. An expert would say something and the narrator would repeat it. They'd give another short sound bite and the narrator would say pretty much the same thing with a graphic to demonstrate. And again. I can hear her voice now: ""A mega tsunami would have the power to xyz"" *cue graphic of rushing water* Expert: ""A mega tsunami would be capable of destorying mpq"" Narrator: ""If a mega tsunami were to abc, it would be able to destroy mpq...""

I don't know if it was because I've got older and 'educated' in various fields, but it's been a very long time since quality and content have been left by the wayside. Having said that, the BBC Nature department seems to be going from strength to strength, so long as they don't repeat any more American style shows (i.e. dramatic music, tension, presenters rushing around).

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; If a kid is very young and is about to do something very dangerous that could mean the parent is not paying enough attention or hasn't created a safe environment for them to grow up in. Why should a child be punished for parental failing? Saying the correct response to accidental harm is to inflict intentional harm and not seeing* the absurdity of it is amusing. Why would anyone want to increase the chances of being feared and resented as a parent by inflicting pain on a child? If a child does something and hurts itself, that is the correct feedback loop, but introducing pain like some schizophrenic loving/wrathful god is only going to confuse matters.

The world isn't a safe place, its full of dangerous things or dangerous situations. Even if you devote your entire being to coddling your child your not going to be able to create a 100% safe environment for a child, although you might well bring them up to have no understanding of just how dangerous the world can be. 

&gt; A good way of understanding the ethics of a particular action is to consider the action universalised. I would suggest in this case it would be any adult physically disciplining any child. If it is just for you to smack your child in a given context it should be just for any other adult to do the same.

Only if you view children as miniature adults. And tbh, if I saw a collage about to stick a screw driver into an exposed 480v power line I would slap their hand away, just the same as I would shove a stranger out of the road if they wandered into on coming traffic.

Then there was the recent Horizon epidose called Playing God, where they investigated the use of transgenic animals and syntetic biology; which I thought was incredibly soberly presented. I think there was even an article on *Pseudomonas* on the BBC news website after the recent hostpital outbreak; so the information is there, if you want to see it.

I'm not entirely sure what the article is trying to achieve. Anyone with half a brain knows that the Today programme and Question Time have a theatrical element to them; and thank gods because the latter keeps me awake on the motorway at 6am every day. When I want meat I'll read journals or pick up a science magazine or some shit.

Now if you think that the BBC should be concerened with the public perception of science, then I would argue that they already to quite a good job of bringing the important stuff to light. But, and here's the thing, there are plently of people that could care less about science; who find it boring, or they just don't want to know.

Against QPR, we were trash, creating nothing...just lobbing in crosses at every opportunity. Constantly taking the ball wider for no reason, leaving only 1 person (Torres) in the box against 4-5 defenders. This has been the same old song and dance for the past few games.

Torres' miss @ Norwich, 6-7 yards from goal was on him, but the vast majority of the other games have been against teams that just park the bus...and we can't break them down.

You can't play a deep defense, then build from the back...not bother to move the ball fast enough with zero creativity and expect to score.

I mean the last thing I tuned into before turning off (as it confirmed my grumble) was the Stargazing Live where they had 'comedian of the month' John Bishop on and interviewed. 
He clearly had little interest in astronomy so you have to wonder what the point was besides some nice promotion for Bishop and another chance for the BBC to slip in a comedian in case the proles find the lack of chuckles in a science program a turn off.

  Watching both Matt smith and David Tennant episodes back to back though I've found that they're very similar. they both do the same ""think think think"" period during each episode, they can both oscillate between joy at seeing something new and exciting and the steely ""you do not want to mess with me attitudes"". they both apologize with all their hearts (I'm so so sorry) and they both display that wonderful childlike glee at seeing the incredible tenacity and adventurism of the human race (think David Tennant in ""Impossible Planet"")
  I feel like matt smith's doctor is a natural progression from David Tennants. Tennant was a doctor who was just beginning to feel his age. He seemed somewhat more jaded than either the 9th or 11th doctors. Think back to his conversation with Jack in Utopia, I feel like that was a good characterization of the wistful nature of the 10th doctor, a man who had seen so much wonder and experienced so much loss. David Tennant is kind of a midlife crisis doctor. A very very old man in a changing universe.
  Matt Smith on the other hand is a doctor who's really come to grips with his age. as Amy says, ""he's so very very old and very very lonely"". His joy is the joy of someone who knows how much they've seen and treasures every new discovery, his rage is the rage of someone who has seen the same mistakes happen time and time again, and his sorrow is that of a very very old man who is feeling the weight of the universe on his shoulders. Moreover, Matt Smith does an excellent job of bringing the Doctor's vanity to the forefront of the viewers attention, as if the emotional journey of his regeneration really cause some serious soul searching.
  In short, more than Matt Smith or David Tennant, I love The Doctor and how he is and tip my hat to both actors for continuing to skillfully portray such an incredible character

true,widgetas,null,null,"While I can understand your point, I think that the smack legislation was perhaps using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

Consider this scenario: A child keeps going for the hob/fire/hot water tap. Left to its own devices it will keep trying to touch something that will burn it. With the best will in the world, with even the most vigilant parents, the chances are that the child will one day be able to touch the hot thing and be hurt.

""No"" says the parent ""It's hot, you'll hurt yourself.""     
Child keeps trying to do it. For whatever reason, the kid still has access to the areas where the hot things are even though the parents try to keep it away.     
""No, hot! It will burn you!""     
Child ignores parent.

Child doesn't understand because it has no concept of how much it will hurt and damage him. What to do? The child can't be reasoned with because it simply does not realise that the heat is that bad. You can restrict access to toys, games, freedom, affection etc. while it continues to misbehave (which is another matter entirely - is that not emotional abuse?), but would a short slap on the back of the hand as the child reaches for the hob not make things very clear? The child now knows not to go near the hob because it associates it with pain even if he doesn't understand why. The lesser of two evils? Short, sharp pain compared to prolonged injury from a burn. Before I get the ""might is not right"" argument, again we're coming from the ""cannot-be-reasoned-with"" side of things.

With this example, the comparison to a husband beating a wife is somewhat strawmanish. For one thing a parent is responsible for the actions and discipline of their child. I am not saying that they therefore have a right to do whatever they wish with their child (I am very anti-circumcision for example) but your two examples are, I think, misleading to an extent.

Just so you know - I am open to reason and am willing to change my mind.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Look at how much university costs, the terms and conditions of paying the fees off, the potential benefits of increased earning power, and then compare that to one of the first things you're likely to do when you graduate: buying a house.  
  
* Rough cost of university covered by loans: £50,000
* Minimum earnings threshold for repayments: £21,000
* Repayment rate above the threshold: 9%  
  
So if you are earning £30,000 a year, you pay only £810 a year in repayments.  
  
* Mortgage rough value: £100,000
* Rough interest payments @ 4%: £4,000
* Annual principal repayment assuming 30-year mortgage: £3,333  
  
So a typical mortgage on a starter home will cost you over £7,000 a year, no matter your income, and your student loan and fee repayments will typically be less than £1,000 a year for quite a long time (you have to be earning around £33,000 a year to force your repayments above the £1,000 mark.)  
  
Paying for your university education has a relatively small impact on your monthly outgoings, and is the single lowest risk investment you are ever likely to make, and attending university will significantly increase your earnings.  Not to mention the experience itself, which is fantastic.

Ah, but that is the genius behind the profit incentive, and the underpinning of economics. We all act in self interest, but in doing so we generate wealth for everyone. However, if the system did not work in everyone's interest, it would rapidly lead to feudalism and be overthrown.

&gt; If others are whining about wage disparity - then they should either a) have studied harder at school b) just get on with it instead of pissing and moaning about how 'unfair' life is c) work harder/smarter.

There is an assumption underlying that; that hard work, study and a decent work ethic are all that is required to be successful. I think we both know that isn't the case. Capitalism currently requires more unskilled people than skilled. It would collapse if everyone could get top jobs. I think wage inequality will always exist under capitalism, and it is a very damaging feature of it. There's nothing controversial about that, capitalism isn't perfect.

true,[deleted],null,null,"""Beating being something an out of control person does"" is something that *you* have applied to the term not something that is generally recognised by any authoritative dictionary.

The truth of the matter is that the difference between beating or hitting and slapping or smacking is that the former are general terms, largely interchangeable, referring to the process of using force to harm another and the later are *methods* of achieving this, in this case using the palm of a flat hand rather than, say, a fist (punch).

The reason you use the terms slapping and smacking is that they are generally considered to be fairly mild forms of hitting when compared to say, kicking or punching.  The reason why I choose the term beating is that it accurately reflects the actual process going on.

**Only a bad parent resorts to beating, hitting, slapping or smacking in order to discipline their child**.  I'm not sure why you felt the need to bring 'emotion' into this, as if a beating by an emotionless parent is acceptable but an angry one doing the exact same thing is abhorrent.

I'm not making an assumption, that being smacked makes you violent I am *asserting* that violence breeds violence and inferring that perhaps you are violent because you all keep beating your children.  There's all sorts of evidence that animals brought up violently become violent animals and we are animals, lets not forget that.  Your form of violence may not be particularly terrible in the grand scheme of things but it's violent behaviour nonetheless.

If smacking taught you that being hit hurts and you *should not do it*, why on earth are you here supporting hurting children needlessly through smacking?  How have you warped your own life lesson so that hurting children is now somehow justifiable.

Or are you arguing that violence is the only way to discipline a child?  Patently *not true*.

I have not presented you with a strawman I have presented you with an example of your argument applied to a different situation; A works at achieving B therefore A is good.

Although it wasn't so much the Doctor being fortunate enough to have a consistent showrunner between 9 and 10 as it was RTD being unlucky enough to have his first pick for the Doctor quit after one season (although some will surely argue that it was a blessing in disguise).

Despite the fact that RTD and Moffat have both had decades of continuity and characters to draw from, they've done a fantastic job restraining themselves from relying on and bogging down the show with tons of old history, while at the same time paying tribute to past details in a respectable manner (such as the reveal of Brigadier's fate in the most recent finale).",0,1327887344,null,0,false,0,c3lx9ek,t3_p26go,t1_c3lx9ek,t1_c3lwdep,null,1428261930,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

true,holdontoyourtowel,null,null,"God, so glad someone else feels this way.  Amy Pond is a useless companion who never says anything funny and whose most impressive feat has been to remember really hard, River Song gets some good lines but is overall just an oversexualized cougar Mary Sue, and their entire plot line has turned the show into The Doctor's Friends, occasionally featuring The Doctor.  Rory's cool, but his badassness is inherently tied into his devotion to Amy, who's mostly just been horrible to him.  Additionally, I don't believe a single bit of the ""emotion"" displayed by any of that family- it's always histrionic and not once has their story line touched my heart.  Say what you will about the other companions (I love all of them, but I'll be the first to admit that Rose was an idiotic chav, Mickey was whipped, Martha was a lovesick rebound, Donna could be shrieky and abrasive), but I related to them, was amused by them, watched them grow as people, and connected to their emotions as they did so- those faults didn't take away from the strength of their actual characters and instead made them more human.  Amy and Rory and River have no real faults, and they have no real emotions, either.  I don't like watching them.

I do, however, love Eleven, but I had to learn this when watching his scenes by himself, and when he interacted with other characters that I automatically knew I'd appreciate much more as companions (i.e. Liz Ten, Nasreen, Rita, Craig and Sophie and Stormageddon, and Canton Delaware).

If anything, I think I feel like Moffat's afraid of emotion, and hides behind his enormously over-complicated multi-season plot arcs.  I have nothing against smart or complicated tv- Sherlock was actually what convinced me that he could really write (though I'm not sure how much of that is owed to Mark Gatiss), but the past several seasons haven't felt really smart, just complicated- it seems like they had enormous buildup, were complicated in a way that alienated the casual viewer and finales that were, in my opinion, extremely anticlimactic.  River's whole two seasons of plot theft (additionally Blink and Silence/Forest, much as I love those episodes) have made me question whether Moffat could write himself out of a wet paper bag without including twenty paradoxes.  Davies might have had some occasionally cheesier or deus ex machina endings, but they had heart, and at least they made sense and didn't basically walk all over the time travel aspect.  The Ponds' story has no heart for me, and I think that Sherlock has shown me that someone needs to just take time travel away from Moffat so that he won't be allowed to play with it anymore :P  Long story short, someone bring us back to Davies' style- that monster-of-the-week with non-intrusive arcs and emotional heart, and let Moffat go back to writing occasional awesome cameo episodes.  Also, more time to work on Sherlock then.

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"True, Moffat didn't pull last-minute tricks out of his hat, but I have other reservations about Moffat's series endings. 

That said, Davies did set up the Doctor-Donna resolution all the way back in 2005, when the Doctor's hand was cut off in the sword fight with the Sycorax. Similarly, the big reveal of ""The End of Time"" - what the sound of drums actually was - was set up three years earlier in ""Utopia"". 

I'll be the first to agree that Davies' finales blew, more often than not. ""Last of the Time Lords"" was ridiculous, ""Journey's End"" was particularly painful at times, and ""The End of Time"" was weak, but he knew what he was doing, even if it didn't work. With Moffat, well...

&gt;And, for reference, the alternate timelines and cryptic prophecies was more of an RTD thing. Bad Wolf, Donna Doctor, Knock Four Times...

...The Pandorica Will Open, Silence Will Fall, Silence Will Fall When The Question is Asked, The Only Water in the Forest is the River, On the fields of Trenzalore, at the fall of the Eleventh, when no living creature may speak falsely or fail to give answer, a question will be asked. A question that must never, ever be answered"".... yeah, that RTD and his cryptic prophecies ;-)

And, uh, for reference, the last two Moffat finales both had alternate timelines that were erased, I thought. Seems like it's as much a Moffat thing as an RTD thing. 

EDIT: Culpable as RTD may be of last-minute fixes, Moffat himself is guilty of this, albeit on a smaller scale. ""Wibbley-wobbley, timey-wimey"" may be the phrase that has defined *Doctor Who* in recent years, but Moffat thought it up because he was running late for a script meeting and didn't have time to come up with anything else.

These are all very true, and very valid. In this case, one of the biggest reasons is the fact that, for 9 and 10, Russell T Davies (RTD) was the showrunner. After The End of Time, Steven Moffat took over that position. When that switch happened, almost all of the production crew switched as well. This really made for a pretty sharp divide between 10 and 11. 

Worth noting that the things from series 1-4 that have been referenced in 5 and 6 (like River and the Angels) are from episodes that Moffat wrote. (That's excluding classic series villains)

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"They weren't really alternate timelines. In the Whoniverse, there are two kinds of 'split timelines'. Those that are naturally occurring are referred to as alternate Universes(Pete's world), and those caused by time travel(usually referred to as simply alternate timelines, a perfect example is The Girl Who Waited).

Big Bang involved the entire Universe simply going away, and what was left over was the result of Earth being the last planet to be wiped out.  There was no alternate timeline, this was all there was left. Think of it like someone drew an elaborate pencil sketching(the Universe), and then someone came along and erased 90% of that sketch. All you're left with is a vague representation of what it once was.  When The Doctor used the Pandorica and flew it into the TARDIS, it was akin to someone redrawing everything that was on that sketch.

Then in The Wedding of River Song, that was simply all of time and space happening at once. I think River referred to it at one point as 'An aborted timeline', but I think that was more of a fancy way of saying 'None of that happened'. But as The Doctor states, it's merely all of time and space happening at once as it all collapses to a singularity due to the fixed point of him dying not being fulfilled.

As for the prophecies, I wouldn't say Moffat's are cryptic. We may not know what they mean, but they almost always refer to specific events. 'The Pandorica Opens' was abundantly clear when we found out what the Pandorica was. The 'Silence will fall' gets slowly answered as we discover what exactly 'The Silence' is.  RTD would have prophecies that wouldn't be clear until the last possible moment, with no hints or clues as to what they mean. The most clear was the 'When you hear four knocks', but was ultimately used to try and cause tension whenever he heard knocking, and then was rather anticlimactic when the knocks came from a trapped Wilfred. But other ones, such as the drums, there was no way to even know what the Hell that meant until The Master said that there were drum beats inside his head.

Also, to be fair, everything from 'Silence will fall' to 'A question that must never, ever be answered' is all part of the same prophecy :p. But even then, you can take some pretty good guesses at what it means. Fall of the 11th could very well be referring to his regeneration, Trenzalore is obviously where it will take place, and we will, in some form, get an answer to the ultimate mystery, which is 'Doctor Who?'. You can take a lot from that prophecy, even without knowing anything.

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"&gt;Big Bang involved the entire Universe simply going away, and what was left over was the result of Earth being the last planet to be wiped out. There was no alternate timeline

If it wasn't an alternate timeline, then what was that whole thing about Amy growing up in a world without any stars? Then in one reality she grew up alone, and in another, she knew who her parents were. Or something.

To be fair, I might be remembering that wrong. I immensely disliked ""The Big Bang"" so much that I will warn you now, any attempt to explain the story has a good chance of going unread. 

&gt;I think River referred to it at one point as 'An aborted timeline', but I think that was more of a fancy way of saying 'None of that happened'. 

That's great! If it works for you. But if Song said that it was an aborted timeline, then I'll stick with what she said, much as I don't care for it. I wish I could re-interpret everything I didn't like or understand so it made more sense to me, but I regard ""The Wedding of River Song"" in only a marginally more favorable light than I do ""The Big Bang.""

And ""None of that happened"" doesn't really apply, because we saw it happen. It's like the Doctor saying the Master's reign of terror on Earth didn't really happen. It did happen. We saw it. You can't say something didn't happen (when we saw it happen) just so you can loophole your way out of a plot. 

We'll have to agree to disagree on the prophecies. It's not the clarity, of lack thereof, that bugs me. It's that *we're still getting these stupid prophecies*. When Prisoner Zero did the whole ""Pandorica will open/Silence will fall"" thing as early as ""The Eleventh Hour"", I rolled my eyes so hard I gave myself a headache. We *just* got out of ""he will knock four times"", we *just* got out of ""Your song is ending"", and what does Moffat give us in his first episode? Two riddles, one of which, to date, is still not fully resolved. It took two series for Moffat to tell us this universe-ending question is the show's title? What's he saying, that when the Doctor has to answer the question, it'll turn out to be one of those aborted timelines where it never happens and where his mystery wasn't divulged, so the show can continue afterwards? Fields of Trenzalor? That's almost as arcane as the Shadow Proclamation or the Medusa Cascade. 

All these prophecies, all these runarounds...I think Moffat's watched *JFK* too much. Riddles wrapped in enigmas wrapped in mysteries.

Looking back, it was kind of a dick move, especially considering how much non-RTD creations such as Sarah Jane, Daleks, and Cybermen added to his own run.

Moffat is lucky that he was able to introduce River Song in Series 4; at least that gave him a little bit of foundation to work with. He had also initially made the pitch to Tennant to stay on the show for one more year after the RTD run, which I imagine would have made for a much smoother transition and would have also allowed Moffat to set more pieces in place for Eleven.

Now that's not to say I'm all for smacking a child about all day every day but I'm not sure that such idealised parenting is always practical or possible.

My own history: I can remember a handful of instances where I had a smack on the bum or the legs. Rather rare and more common when I was much younger for various reasons family reasons which I'm sure you can work out. But I can justify any instance of it occurring - that is to say it wasn't random and there was a reason behind it. I'm not saying they were justified, but I know why it was done.

true,trust_the_corps,uk,Sir Fartnozzle,"I'm sorry but that is an outrageous philosophy of law. I consider a government that outlaws homosexuality and maintains that law criminal its self. How can you condemn people for breaking the law when those making the law act as criminals themselves? If all laws were reasonable then I would agree, follow them blindly. But when a law is found to be unreasonable those who determine this before the law makers should not be punished for that. The law makers are themselves guilty for the crime of passing or maintaining improper law and in doing so giving justification for not taking the law seriously. Once they fuck it up it is out of their hands. They have proven themselves unworthy of the responsibility and it falls onto the individual to determine right and wrong. Your prior case is irrelevant because that its self is an injustice (two fold)

You are putting far too much power into the hands of law makers. What if they outlawed criticising the law? Would you still maintain that any convictions under that law should still be upheld even after it is repealed? What they have done in the case of homosexuality is a travesty of justice. Those convictions should not only be quashed but those convicted should be compensated for false imprisonment. Making a non-crime a crime is the greatest of evils. Laws against Cannabis possession are much less extreme and would certainly not warrant much in the way of compensation but each thing must be handled on a case by case basis. Would it really be necessary to uphold convictions for simply possession where the user is otherwise an upstanding citizen?

There's an interesting snag to your philosophy. Inverse it to: What if something is legal that clearly shouldn't be? What if there is a loop hole in the law that lets someone murder? They should get away with it?

Knocking them out of their only competition is sweet sweet revenge. The thing i'm angry about the most regarding QPR is not the first game in the league (That's football)....nor the owner whining about it.

It's the fact that the some of the QPR squad were planning to snub Terry in the handshake.

What will happen next; it is pretty conceivable now that Hester will begin his exit plan, as he has secured his personal reputation with the City for turning RBS around *and* turning down his pay. He has nothing left at RBS. The Treasury will now have to find a CEO (from the current market of executives) to fill this incredibly toxic and thankless position.

The truly weird bit, or one of the weird bits, is that the yanks insisted Europe do this, ostensibly to put the squeeze on the Chinese counterfeits market, but have recently stated that they will not be legally bound by it. Yet Europe's pressing ahead anyway, even though the European common market and each EU state already has better developed legal mechanisms in place to deal with copyright and counterfeitting. So there is actually no reason at all for this. It will truly exist only to create potentially terrible side-effects. It's as if Europe has been told it doesn't have cancer, but decides to go for the chemo anyway. Just nuts. The fact the yanks have said they won't be legally bound by it is also pretty sinister. they are reserving the right to use it when it suits them, essentially. So, if they want to get someone for something, they will be able to say ""ACTA"", but if they want to do something that violates ACTA they can say, ""NOT ACTA.""

The government often responds to that pressure by making changes even if those changes don't work for the best of the country as a whole. The government will generally placate a vocal minority because it wins them votes in the short term. Years and years of things like that have affected the country's financial situation and right now, as we all know, we're struggling to rub two brass farthings together. Decades of stupid snap decisions by governments, stupid laws and a public that cares more about its rights than its responsibilities have come to a head now and our financial situation is such that we really can't afford to pay for what we actually need.

I think in cases as highlighted in this article it is easier, but there have been cases where a child simply had bruising and social services became a large part of that family's life.    

Von Willebrand disease runs in our family. It is genetic. It means some of us bruise VERY easily (and also bleed a lot!) which as you can imagine can cause lot's of problems with toddlers running around bumping into things.    

So when kids from our family show up to school they will have bruises running down their arms or legs, but that isn't related to any kind of abuse - just genetics.

You might think that unjust but I imagine there are people who think it's 'wrong' to raise your voice to a child too - such an act would scare the child, after all.

&gt; hitting a child

You see... The 'violence' I see as acceptable I would not describe as hitting. To me if you hit someone then you're causing them damage in some way - semi-permanent at least i.e. a bruise.

In my scenario the smack is not punishment and it would not be intended as such. I think that's the fundamental difference. It's a 'wake-up', as it were, intended to break the child out of whatever mindset it had at the time. I don't think I'd ever use such a thing as a punishment but rather a way of making the child understand that a particular action wasn't acceptable. You might disagree and say it's the same thing, but of course I don't. Not at the moment.

You might think it moot to say ""I was slapping the child on the hand to teach it a lesson/make it understand that it shouldn't do that, not as a punishment"" but I can assure you that's not how it would be intended.

I would say that advocating smacking as a legitimate parenting tool means that it can be used in extreme situations when there is the potential for danger to a child being avoided. The lesser of two evils, as it were. With the best will in the world it is often simply not practical to go through a series of steps with a child. There are always extremes, like I've outlined above and the dismissal ""Well you shouldn't have got yourself into that situation"" doesn't change the reality a parent might find themselves in. While I agree that there will be people who abuse their position (because, again, this is reality) I'm not sure that that should mean others are penalised for not actually harming their child.

The people who would use too much force on their children (most likely in their own home, after all) are still going to be doing it.

My qualifications: I have the usual level of knowledge about astrology, critical thinking ability, I used to have a wide-ranging interest in the occult and I read a [very interesting study a while ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forer_effect#Forer.27s_demonstration) demonstrating that the same horoscopes can be shown to a variety of people and each of them will believe it describes them personally. Plus I just read several Wikipedia pages about astrology and some of the sources, if that counts :P

(I don't buy the assumption that you have to have personal experience in a thing before dismissing it. Life's too short and there's too many beliefs to have to assume they're all true until you try and reject them all, so we necessarily do it the other way round.)

So that study, plus allowing for coincidences and a healthy amount of natural human pattern-finding, shows why the results of astrological predictions alone can't reliably demonstrate its truth or untruth. So we have to go to the other end and look at the conventional theories about the causes.

My understanding is, broadly speaking, that astrologers in this part of the world make their conclusions mainly from the Zodiac constellations, the positions of the Sun and local planets, and a person's date of birth, correct? They draw a geometric link between these factors and various personality traits and cosmic influences.

 My issue with that is a) there is little interest by modern astrologers in investigating or explaining the actual mechanics of it, the where's, why's and how's of it, beyond some handwaving about cosmic vibrations, and b) all of the key information involved is completely arbitrary. It's the product of a geocentric mindset that should have gone out with Copernicus. For example, the constellations are not real things - their apparent groupings are determined by the Earth's position in space. Dates of birth are not real things - our calendar is only the latest in a long line of different calendars. Houses and aspects are not real things - they are determined by astrological tradition. 

The fact that all these non-real things can be bought together in an intricate system and made to relate to real things - people, events - is a testament to human ingenuity and the endless search for understanding, both of which are to be applauded, in my opinion. So you're welcome to your beliefs in that light, but you should understand that there are reasons why most other people will treat these ideas as kooky pseudo-science and deride them. Your father should give up his constant battle with the BBC and go back to making stories out of stars.

I think it's a real shame the way attitudes have changed towards the cost of university tuition in such a short space of time. When I was a student, people still got (means-tested) maintenance grants for living expenses - tuition fees were unimaginable. In around ten years, we've gone from that situation to one where many people think it's quite right that university students should pay £9k a year in tuition alone.

true,CharlieSaylor,cyberman,Cyberperson,"I really enjoyed watching Nine develop emotionally over the course of his season. At first serious and bitter, slowly becoming warmer and more willing to view everything with a more optimistic and fresh outlook.  He had great chemistry with Rose, and the episodes were great to watch together or separately. I wasn't a big fan of Mickey- he was way too clingy and didn't seem to have a real purpose other than to get upset with Rose. I enjoyed Rose's mum a bit, and how the family dynamic played out.


Ten was also a great doctor. It was fun to see how Tennant's Doctor interacted with Rose and her family, as well as with the other companions. Ten was quirky and a bit serious, as well as more emotional and just less tough in general. He really played up the sad traveler that knows he will always outlive his friends. It got a bit old at times, but was mostly endearing. Martha was a very smart woman, though it saddened me that she fell for the doctor so quickly, and that she wouldn't/couldn't/didn't really get over him. She could have been so much more without all the unrequited love drama. Donna at first just got on my nerves with her abrasive personality but I think she is finally growing on me, and I am starting to see her more as funny than annoying. I loved that there were individual storylines contained in some episodes (Such as with Sally Sparrow) and it would be great to see something like that happening again.


Eleven is very childish and goofy, but at the same time mentally a step ahead of everyone else. It is a lot of fun to watch him so excited about everything. At first I really enjoyed Amy and the relationship she seemed to have with the Doctor - that of a childlike best friend, or perhaps something like Calvin and Hobbes? Maybe not exactly, but they did enjoy getting in lots of trouble with each other, and seemed to understand each other very well. With the introduction of Rory, however, I grew to like Amy less and less. She is an absolutely terrible significant other for him, and he isn't exactly the best to her either. The situation kind of reminds me of Rose/Mickey/Doctor but I wasn't rooting for Amy as a love interest, and Rory is even more clingy and annoying than Mickey. I really can't find any redeeming characteristics for Rory. River is ok, but there was nothing about her that made me interested in her. Especially once we find out who she is. I enjoyed seasons 5 and 6, but wish the style would gravitate more towards the previous 'new who' seasons. I like that they make me think and are more intellectual than most TV out there, but I don't enjoy picking out particular episodes to watch as much fun as previous seasons. There are really no stand-alone episodes or mini story arcs that I would want to show a not-whovian-yet-but-hopefully-will-be-soon friend.

Since the Sentencing Guidelines changed on the 16th Jan there are 3 separate categories of offence for each of Domestic and non-Domestic burglary. There are a number of factors which will affect the culpability and harm of the offence which will lead to the categorisation of the burglary.

Category 1 and many Category 2 burglars will go straight to Crown Court for trial and sentencing. Category 3 burglars (the Low Level ones I was referring to) will stay at the Magistrates' Court. 

The starting point for sentencing of a Cat 3 burglary is a community order with a lower range of a fine and an upper range of custody. Most burglars appearing in Magistrates' Court for the first time will start of at the lower end of the range. If they choose to be stupid enough to continue to offend then the punishment will increase as they either commit more serious offences, or they keep ending up back in court because they're not very good at burgling.

So students starting in September will pay approximately 10% interest on their first years loan.  They will borrow ~15000 pounds and by the start of their second year will owe ~16000 pounds.  Fucking great deal for the SLC huh?  Where else can someone get a 10% return on investment that is government guaranteed?

The latest financial advice says that the BoE base rate is likely to stay where it is for 2 years.  So inflation will remain at least 6% well into 2015.  So upon graduating the average student will have borrowed £45k (3x15) but will owe £53k.  They would almost be better just putting it on the credit card.

Again though, I'd go back to whether that's really such a terribly bad thing anyway; I pay significantly more towards the NHS which benefits everyone, which I don't begrudge at all - I think the NHS is a wonderful thing. But if I pay for private health insurance, and were to opt out of paying for the NHS (were such an option available to me), that would significantly disadvantage people less well off than myself (people that conceivably contributed towards the cost of my university tuition). This is all social contract stuff for me in which I strongly believe. At the risk of exposing myself as a complete socialist and/or hippy, I believe we're stronger if we cooperate, and I don't assume that public services like education and health provision only benefit the individual.

I appreciate mine is now a minority opinion (in England at least - I live in Scotland), it just seems a terrible shame to me. I believe that education is intrinsically good - again, another opinion, I'm sure that puts me in the minority. I honestly didn't mean to start trying to convince people of anything; as I say, I'm well aware mine is the minority opinion in England - the argument is essentially over south of the border.

I've always wondered if a formation like [this](http://this11.com/topics/add/abB129gakg) would work. The idea here is that Ramires has a little more ground to cover but I think he can do it. Once he receives the ball he makes a run to beat the first man and slots it off to Mata who has options. On the left side you have the players a little closer to one another playing some short passing. Mata, Cole, and the LW. There is a little more space between Mata and Sturridge. When the defenders get pulled over, Mata can toss it over to Sturridge who has some room to shoot. My only qualms with this are that it opens us up to a lot defensively. The LW is going to have to track back a bit. Torres and Mata will have to be good at pressing so that they can pinch the oppositions DM. 

You could swap Romeu in for Essien there as well. 

I think we also need to consider what happens with McEachran's loan. I think it could take anywhere from 3 months to just over a year before he starts really hitting his stride with enough consistency to be a serious first team asset. That could change things up a bit. Kakuta has been playing CAM at Dijon and could in theory (being hopeful yes I know) factor into the squad by next Jan. Piazon is probably 2 seasons away but I guess you never know with these things. It seems like were also seriously looking to bring in Lucas. We will basically have a lot of players who can play AM or as wingers and it will be interesting to see how we use them and what will happen to our shape.

&gt;Like it or lump it; the remuneration of financial sector CEOs is a lot in personal income terms. 

Yeah, fuck the shareholders!  Like it or lump arseholes, we got your money now, hah hahaha.

You still don't get it do you?  You talk about him as if he's just another private sector CEO.  He is not.  He's working for the government, for the public.  He's a glorified civil servant.  

&gt;**nuking** the one CEO the Treasury has a majority stake because, frankly, the general public have no clue what is going on.

He'll still get at least get a million pounds, if he doesn't get a bonus.  The public are wondering why a civil servant is such massive rewards.  He may very well be the highest paid UK public sector worker ever.

&gt;What will happen next;

Let me guess, a slippery slope logical fallacy?

&gt;it is pretty conceivable now that Hester will begin his exit plan, as he has secured his personal reputation with the City for turning RBS around and turning down his pay. He has nothing left at RBS. The Treasury will now have to find a CEO (from the current market of executives) to fill this incredibly toxic and thankless position.

Yes, those poor underrated bastards working for the public.  It's like the public expects those being paid by them not to score millions or pounds a year for doing a mediocre to shit job.  When will the selfish public learn?  When CEOs are homeless probably!  I'm surprised politicians don't just walk off and go work for all these highly paid million pound salary positions in the private sector.

There was Hester, walking into a bank in tatters, owned by the public.  How was he to know the conditions wouldn't be comparable to Goldman?  It's not like he read the papers and saw the public outrage at bonuses.  No, he was probably forced into the job.  I bet he was kidnapped from a luxury job to come and work for RBS at gunpoint.

A man would have to be an idiot not to realise the difference between working for a private company and a public one.  Everyone knows the difference.

&gt;but have completely diverted attention from the Euro Soveriegn Debt Clusterfuck

Err, no.  One, the eurocrisis is the main news today.  Two, the banking debt crises were converted into the current sovereign debt crises.

&gt;and other things that actually matter.

Actually, bonuses were one of the main reasons behind the banking crisis.

&gt;The New York State Comptroller's Office has said that in 2006, Wall Street executives took home bonuses totaling $23.9 billion. ""Wall Street traders were thinking of the bonus at the end of the year, not the long-term health of their firm. The whole system—from mortgage brokers to Wall Street risk managers—seemed tilted toward taking short-term risks while ignoring long-term obligations. The most damning evidence is that most of the people at the top of the banks didn't really understand how those [investments] worked.""

The incentive for executives in general is to make as much money as possible, in as short a time as possible.  Making their pay proportional to the share price is one great way to ensure that banks play high stakes, which is fine, except that the losses have been forced onto the public.  The same public you insult as knowing nothing.

You know what the public knows?  It knows that rbs has tanked further, it's share prices have plummeted to 20p each.  It's so bad, that no bank wants to buy it for any reasonable price.  It's worthless and for presiding over this, the ceo is getting a million pound reward on top of the million he'll already get.  Yes, what idiots the public are.  Without the bonus, I guess the share price would have fallen to 5p.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; Not a good argument, as the cost of preventing crime in general is vastly greater than the cost of crime in general.

I hear this argument a lot and it makes no sense. We prohibit murder because murder is ethically intolerable. Drugs are not ethically intolerable. Only some side effects of side effects are. Prohibition of murder is directly ethically justified. The war on drugs is justified consequentially. If we don't prohibit drugs then bad things will happen. Both are viable but are different. If the consequences turn out to be different then a law based upon consequences naturally must be brought into question.

It is absolutely correct that we draw a straight up line on offences that are directly inconsistent with our ethics. On pragmatic issues like the war on drugs this is not the case. There is no ethical grounds on which drugs are prohibited. The prohibition was a lesser evil of reducing freedom to reduce harm. If it doesn't reduce harm then the lesser evil is just an evil and not justifiable.

The only issue with drugs are the other consequences and our policy must naturally be aligned with maximum harm reduction. Precisely because drugs policy is not directly about clear cut ethics itself. Regardless it isn't at all comparable to natural crimes like murder, assault or theft.

Most public schools teach basic civics/government classes, so we are taught how the U.S. government works (or *doesn't*, tee hee hee), but there is no discussion of current events or american foreign policy at all (perhaps this is taught in higher-level elective classes).  We are also taught a great deal about American history. As far as Europe and Asia, we learn ancient history and the major empires, and some European history up until WW2, but nothing modern at all. We learn nothing about Africa, South America, or Australia. 


As far as geography goes, we never had any class that focused entirely on geography. I remember when I was young we may have had one or two tests where we had to label American states, but I don't recall ever being made to learn any foreign geography at all. 

I am not sure whether it is true that American just ""don't care"" about the rest of the world, or see it as irrelevant. The problem as I see it is that our major news outlets barely cover any news from overseas, so if you are an American who only consumes mainstream news, you will have no idea what the hell is going on in the rest of the world.

Partying *all* the time, drinking with friends on the street and gobbing off to all and sundry every night - and threatening/enacting violence when politely confronted. Shit like that sucks when you have to get up for work the next day and your job depends on you, you know, having sleep! :)


Most people accept that parties occur and shit happens, but when you've been dealing with partying for *months, non-stop, every single day*, then it starts to affect you physiologically, and that's where the antisocial bit comes in.


Alcohol is a big issue where ASB is concerned. I have alcoholic neighbours and it somehow gives them a superhuman ability to never need sleep. Be it 3, 4, 5am or 6 in the evening, they're pissed and loud and usually fighting with each other. Not a nice environment to live in, but the worst part is, it's nothing to do with you, and there's not much you can do to stop it.


Certainly the council are a limp dick and the police can't do anything until criminal damage or proof of threats occur. We compiled video evidence of the noise conditions for almost a year but apparently that's not suitable evidence - the council prefer you *writing down a statement on a bit of paper* as evidence. I shit you not. But even with *that* formidable proof, they can't do fuck all, so you just gotta put up with it if you can't move.


What pisses me off the most is that despite a year of all our neighbours complaining in the block (4 households), and us all coming together to *sign* a fucking *petition* asking to have the neighbour removed or otherwise dealt with, they duly gave them a secure tenancy so what the fuck are you supposed to do to deal with that?

On what level are your unfounded, opinionated and moderately aggressive remarks on a subject you have no experience of even remotely intellectually challenging? 

&gt; I presume you are a man: how dare you have an opinion on women voting or abortion? I presume you are not a muslim: how dare you have an opinion on sharia law, arranged marriages, or the koran? I presume you are not a politician: how dare you have an opinion on expenses, voting, gerrymandering, or parliamentary procedure?

Wow, so many irrelevant strawman arguments. Having an opinion on sharia law or arranged marriages are not the same as telling a muslim how to be a muslim. Having an opinion on abortion is not the same as telling a woman how to be a woman.

&gt; I'm no husband, but I get to say you are a shit if you need to smack obedience into your wife. I'm no carer, but I get to say you are a shit if you need to smack obedience into a those with learning difficulties.

More hysterical and irrelevent arguments? I said that when you have a small tribe of perfectly behaved children in tow I'd listen to you, please explain how this relates to assaulting handicapped people.

&gt; So I'm right then and you are just another childed person who thinks smacking kids is effective parenting, who doesn't want to listen to any opinion. Think about the arguments in this thread, until then you might just be ruining your children's life.

No, you are a twat. Sure, confiscated toys are effective but so is a smack when necessary. You seem to be yet another one of many hysterical douches in this thread who can't tell the difference between disciplining a child and an NSPCC advert.

&gt; 'I know best, I'll smack my kids if I want' - what an excellent argument.

""I don't need to have experience to tell people they're doing something wrong"" - this is essentially the essence of your highly opinionated response.

Yes this is true. You don't need experience to flap your lips on parenthood, but I'll say it again, until you do then reading your words is no more enlightening than listening to the wind blow.

If you can't see why that's true then there's not really anything else to say.

Or perhaps the kitchen is so small that there's no way of keeping the stove out of reach of the child.

I do 'support' smacking, although that could imply something more than I support. So it would be fairer to say ""I support the use of physical action, be it a short sharp slap on the hand or on the rear, to enforce the statement or reasoning behind a child not doing something.""

This edge case is going nowhere because you are adamant that your method is the best and right one: no pain ever, though you make the case that it is with regards to punishment and I agree with that. I have never said I think it should be used as a punishment, but rather a deterrent. You might say that's the same thing, but of course I disagree. However, you yourself support pain through as a deterrent too, though you think that causing pain via the thing that causes pain is somehow a different lesson to the slap on the hand method.

true,simpleman87,lfc68,,"To be honest I've became a Liverpool fan not because of the team but because of it's supporters. The game that converted me into one was the Champions league final of 2005. As a neutral spectator I watched the game and I remember footage of Liverpool supporters in the half time still sitting in the stands supporting them no matter the outcome. I as an American seeing many of the American sports such as American Football and Basketball for many years, would have seen any of the fans for any of the teams leave the Stadium or Arena after their team was being completely dominated in the first half of the game. It is the loyalty to the club that amazed me. I as an American hate to see people jump on the bandwagon. One year you'll see someone wear a jersey of the club that has won the league and the next you'll see them wear another! It the loyalty of the so called fans that at times disgusts me. When seeing the reactions of the Liverpool fans at the halftime it completely amazed me. Complete loyalty to a club is something that is rare these days. On the plus side, this game had me glued to my seat for an entire three hours talk about a real nail bitter. Seeing Jerzy Dudek in extra time and penalties was amazing how he manage to keep Liverpool in the hunt for the title. Up to this date that is one game of any sport I remember the most.

I'd partially agree with that, but it's subjective; you only have to look at some of the American-centric subreddits to see that they place very little value on English, History, and other arts degrees (if you're not ""an engineer"" your education is considered essentially worthless; God forbid we're ever stupid enough to end up like that). If you don't believe those have merit in an enlightened society that I'm afraid we're destined to fundamental disagreement. I have a degree in politics and a masters in an IT related discipline. I earn most of my living from the IT related one, but I'm much more rounded as an individual and more employable as a candidate because I have both. Plus, you know, I like being educated in a variety of subjects, and I was lucky enough to go to university at a time where tuition was free and I got to do an arts degree as well as a science one without bankrupting myself.

The NHS in England will have effectively have an entrance exam before too long; already some trusts are choosing to withdraw care from people that smoke, are overweight, or do too little exercise, and while I have some sympathy with the sentiment behind that, while smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise remain legal, it's completely unacceptable that care should be withdrawn from taxpayers who are not breaking the law.

I do accept what you're saying, but free provision of education and free healthcare really aren't that dissimilar. The principle - that the better off should contribute towards the cost of provision for the less well off - is the same, and I'd refer you back to my previous point about how I, as a payer of the higher rate of tax, think that's an excellent and equitable redistribution; I have no problem paying for other people's education (or healthcare) since I appreciate very well that I've benefitted from that system.",0,1327948437,null,0,false,0,c3m4zf1,t3_p2wkl,t1_c3m4zf1,t1_c3m3k4c,null,1428265664,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Tennant is the Doctor who is trying to actually *deal* with those post war emotions. He is trying to find out who he is in light of the terrible thing he had to do. It is why he brings up the war all the damn time and all of his stories are so emotional.

Smith is the Doctor who is trying to move on. The mania may be a reaction to that. He won't let himself sit still because he is afraid of the dark places his mind will go if he does. ",0,1327950882,null,0,false,0,c3m5hnw,t3_p2jb8,t1_c3m5hnw,t1_c3m0rx9,null,1428265895,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

When no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer, A question, THE first question, hidden in plain sight from the dawn of time itself, will be asked, A question that must never be answered, 
There are many myths about creatures with the ability to force truthful answers out of people. I suggest such a creature will be there on the fields when the question is asked. Either that or the doctor will be put in a situation where him lying will have extreme consequences such as rivers death. 
And Silence MUST fall when the question is asked.**
This line if quoted correctly is odd silence must fall. Not the silence. I think this means that the alien known as the silence may be involved possibly as a means of making everyone forget the answer that no one should know. 

I also have a theory aside from this that still uses the idea of the Doctor having to tell the truth. I think it explains everything including why River ends up in prison. Basically the question is asked and to save everyone River kills the doctor forcing a regeneration. The Doctor truthfully answers the question. Doctor who? I don't know.

&gt;How dare members of the public take up public space!

They were stopping other members of the public from using the space in the way it is intended. It's a place to enjoy yourself, not to make a political point. I could pull my bed outside and sleep on it, taking up the whole pavement, and stop other people from walking on it. I would be a member of the public using a public space, but I would obviously be doing it wrong, and would rightfully be moved along.

&gt;How dare people question the authorities?

Questioning the authorities is fine, but you are very naive if you believe the campers in St. Andrews Square were making one bit of difference to the banks, the authorities or the status quo in general. They could have achieved the same impact with one march or protest. All they did by camping there for however many months was lose the support of local residents. 

They were evicted not because the banks were scared, but because residents were sick of the sight of them.

&gt; &gt; That space is for people

&gt;So protestors aren't people now, eh?

With that skill at taking things out of context, you could be a politician. The quote was ""That space is for people, and kids, to enjoy."", not ""That space is for people, not protestors"".

true,kyzf42,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"In ""The Wedding of River Song,"" the series 6 finale, River sends out a distress signal to all of time and space, reaching all the way back to the beginning of the universe, saying the Doctor is in trouble and needs help.  It apparently produced many responses, from people all over creation who want to help the Doctor, but other than that this event is pretty much without consequence, as they don't actually call on any of those responders for help.  So why is it even mentioned?  Surely Moffat isn't just trying to boost the Doctor's confidence here.  He's dropping a thread that he'll pick up later.  
  
Now this signal is out there, being picked up by people since the beginning of time, saying ""The Doctor needs help.""  But not everyone knows the Doctor.  So the natural response, the question that has been asked since the very beginning, is, of course, ""Doctor who?""  And among a certain group of fanatics, it has become a very important question, because they feel that it must not ever be answered.  They may have inside knowledge related to the secrecy behind the Doctor's true name, or are simply protective of the question itself, believing it to be a fundamental part of the universe, and therefore unwilling to let it be answered, because an answer will forever destroy the question.  Whatever the case, their driving belief is that silence will (must) fall when the question is asked.  In other words, the question must not be met with an answer.  
  
The truly odd thing here is that they somehow know exactly when this will occur -- on the fields of Trenzalore at the Fall of the Eleventh -- and yet they feel they can alter the outcome.  They already know that the question will meet its answer, but their goal is to prevent that answer from being heard.  
  
**TL;DR: River sends out a signal, a question comes back, the Doctor answers, and the Silence stick their fingers in their ears and say ""LALALALALALA WE CAN'T HEAR YOU LALALA.""**",0,1327958849,null,0,true,0,c3m76mq,t3_p37t4,t1_c3m76mq,t3_p37t4,null,1428266698,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Other than that, it's probably the best street in the area.

My street is one of 4 that surround a primary school in a square shape, and when I go outside for a fag I can usually hear shouting, screaming and fighting from the other side of the school, that's where the bad part of the estate starts. I generally don't enjoy walking through there and when I do it's only during the day.

You hit the nail on the head, in a way, when you said there are Doctor Who fans who do not know who Karen Gillan is. It is entirely possible that if you said to someone ""Look, it's Karen Gillan!"", they would have no idea who you were on about. You would have to then clarify that you meant the person who plays Amy Pond in Doctor Who. It is simpler, quicker, and less ambiguous, in most cases, to just say Amy Pond and trust in the intelligence of the person that they would know you meant the actor, not the character. This, of course, depends on the person knowing the character in question any better than the actor, but given this comic was submitted to this subreddit, it's fairly safe to assume that most people here will have some idea who Amy Pond is. So it's not at all ""unlikely"" that the person is deliberately using the wrong name.

Troughton- Hufflepuff, A little harder but he's extremely loyal to his companions and cheery.

Pertwee- Gryffindor easily for all his dashing derring-do and panache.

Tom Baker- Slytherin/Ravenclaw. Definitely the curious scientist and absent minded professor. but a bit distant and I get a hint of Slytherin in there.

Davison- Gryffindor/Hufflepuff. Very loyal to his companions and very brave, between the two I'd have to give him Hufflepuff.

Colin Baker- Gryffindor/Slytherin. Very brave and melodramatic, onward! But at the same time is a little insensitive, only thinking of himself so there's some Slytherin.

McCoy- Slytherin easily for his sly and cunning ways. Some Ravenclaw in there secondary.

McGann- Hufflepuff for his love of life and the friends and support he has around him (he's often on about this in the radio dramas).

All the new Who Doctors have more Gryffindor in them in general....

Eccleston- Gryffindor, because he's not really the H/S or R type to me...Maybe a bit more Ravenclaw than H or S.

Tennant- Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw. Very loyal to his friends and very brave (but again, new Who Doctors). And Ravenclaw for all the times his voice gets squeaky and he tries to do the eccentric thing.

Quantity has nothing to do with quality as I'm sure you're aware. Name me one channel that compares to the BBC output in terms of quality?

true,RedSquaree,,Belfast,"Let me address your last point first. I edited my second last point to make it clear that I don't actually object to the BBC existing at *all*, just at my expense. You like Doctor Who? That's good for you, but I shouldn't have to pay for it. I don't want to partially fund the wages of the likes of Wossy (I know he's gone now), Brucie, Paxman etc., people who are on millions or hundreds of thousands (and I don't watch their shows). That doesn't sit well with me.

For the record, I seem to recall Panorama coming across as (at least slightly) sensationalist. I can't think of many specifics offhand other than their programme ""Life Behind Bars"" a few years ago. It was quite bad.

Quality vs quantity. I don't think ITV1 or Channel 4 do too badly up against BBC1. I just checked the listings for tomorrow for the three channels, I prefer ITV1's listings and I don't have to pay for it. Besides, it's an uneven playing field anyway as the BBC is at an advantage (more airtime and no *annoying* advertisements apart from a shitload of trailers).

I accept your point about BBC Three being a playground but that shouldn't be the case. I doubt the top execs feel that way. They actually think this is what young people want to watch. It's as if a couple of years ago they thought ""the kids don't like our channel. needs more Russell Howard and sex"". They're just not doing it right and we shouldn't all have to pay for it.

Just as a side point, I remember watching a debate on TV about this issue and someone on the panel raised the point that the BBC's commercial operations can use the resources paid for by tv licencing. I can't provide proof (I'm sure the BBC would be very careful about this if it did go on) but fuck everything about that.

If the BBC is so good, why can't it do just as well with advertisements?

Approx frequency of these buses:  
45: every 30 mins  
24: every 30 mins  
34: every 15 mins  
More information if you google something like: ""Lothian service 34""

Then find a room somewhere near (very near) the routes of these Buses. My prefeence would be near the city centre, that is somewhere BEFORE Gorgie as you're travelling from the centre to HW on a 34 or a 25 Bus. 

Since you're doing postgrad, I am assuming that you probably won't need to be at the uni most of the week, and almost not at all when you'll be writing your thesis. It therefore makes sense to live in the civilised area and not in the student halls in the middle of nowhere. It also makes sense for your home to be near when you're coming back from work or after a night out. A room in the centre should not cost you more than £350 inc bills. 

Areas to look for:
City centre: I guess the best area for you is the area around the Haymarket station.  
Ocean terminal: it's a long commute to HW (~1 hr) but offers very nice ocean views, a large shopping centre near-by and newly-built flats. Also, it may be far from HW but it's close to everything else and it's likely that there is a bus to literaly everywhere from there. A ""safe"" option if you don't know where you'll end up working at.

It surprises me he's not been used as a CB more though - he plays there for Croatia more often than not, and his abilities seem far more suited to that position. Couple of years ago I thought he and Kaboul would eventually turn out to be our main CB partnership. He's just that bit too slow off the mark, and hasn't been able to get the topflight CB experience to learn how to make up for it.

When we are little we learn about Greeks Romans and Egyptians, middle ages, black death, Tudors, Stewarts, Georgians, WW1 and WW2, then as we get older we study WW2, WW1 and tudors AGAIN, agin and again and again from the German side, the Russian side, the Japanese side, the Brit side, the French side, the US Side, we learn about Vietnam, Korea, McCarthyism, the berlin wall, the cold war, and I personally learnt about edo period Japan, samurais and shit. That was up to the age of 16. After that I think people tend to learn about the Russian revolution and WW2 and Tudors again. 

But the American mutiny thing is super low on the agenda - India was way more important to us I think, and there are bigger picture things to learn about the like industrial revolution, which was epoch changing. Frankly I am shocked we don't cover archaeological era stuff, like Mesopotamia. In the vast sweep of history it matters far more that we had your colony long enough to make you speak English and forever after be nice to us than it is that you revolted.

true,notreallysorry,lfc68,null,"To me, Agger is to us what Vidic and Pique are to Man U and Barcelona respectively. Ball playing centrebacks who aren't afraid to get into the opposition half and create/score goals. 

It's such a shame that he's constantly been injured and hasn't had a consistent run in the side. He and Skrtel have been magnificent for us this season.
