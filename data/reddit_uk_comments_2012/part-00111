true,BleinKottle,null,null,"Great advice and a top notch post, mate. Growing up by the sea it's surprising how often things which are second nature to me come as incredible surprises to friends or folk who have no idea that the things they are doing are incredibly dangerous.

I'd add DO NOT SWIM AGAINST RIPS SWIM ACROSS THEM.....

e2a: On top of optiomkix great linky, basically a rip may appear as a less tumultuous avenue in the line of surf, so if you are being battered by breakers it may even appear as an appealing channel to swim/paddle toward.....

However it will drag you out to open sea, which is terrifying if you aren't a strong swimmer/are knackered/don't like being out of your depth.....

If you swim against them you will tire yourself out and get nowhere. I cannot stress this enough, so many people get panicked in the ocean and exhaust themselves in riptides then end up outback without the energy to tread water.

And DONT BRING YOUR BLOW UP DINGHY INTO THE ATLANTIC.

(second one might be a tad contentious, but I've seen more trouble caused by them than by surfers, bodyboarders and paddlers put together)

Finally, BE AWARE OF TIDE TIMES.....If that awesome cove/rock pool you are exploring has easy access, make sure it's not Low tide on a spring tide because in half an hour that outcrop is liable to be totally submerged, and everyone dies. Tide tables are broadcast on the local news and are available in pamphlet form from pretty much any beachside establishment. If you are unfamiliar with an area you have no idea how it looks at low/high tide, so rely on the figures and beware of what the ocean is doing.

Tides change roughly every 6 hours, and when it's 'spring tide' the tidal range is huge (i.e:the sea goes really far out and really far back in) and 'neap tide' where the difference is less so - but still significant here in the SW!!

(PLEASE NOTE: 'Spring tide' has nothing to do with the seasons, it is a cyclical thing which happens as part of the lunar cycle and has nothing to do with the time of year it is.....)

The tidal range in the SW, even moreso in the Brizzle channel is the second most variable in the entire world (second only to a certain part of the Amazon basin). This means that the tide can seem miles away one minute and suddenly you are up to your ankles and all your stuff is getting soaked.....It's most pronounced in places like Weston-super-mare and stuff where the low lying flatlands have the tides race upon you with shocking speed, but down here in the bays and cliffs and coves of cornwall and devon they bring their own risks, take care when rockpooling.

Finally, just remember the Atlantic isn't a swimming pool, as much as the lifeguards do a sterling job and try incredibly hard to keep beaches as safe as possible, it's basically 'no man's land' and you are on your own out there. It's NOTHING like your local swimming pool.

Have fun, but be careful. The sea is one scary bloody place!

I'm sure alcohol plays a massive role too for both the guys and girls. Girls under the influence will go home with guys they might regret sleeping with later, especially if they sober up during the night and change their mind. And guys on alcohol get more aggressive, more confident and less likely to be reasoned with if a girl who was keen to go home suddenly starts to put on the brakes.

I agree entirely that we need to get into peoples' heads, and the way to do that is to have honest discussion about rape, and how it can be in many different forms and how BOTH men and women can be more responsible.

What I find most interesting about the film is the scene where the IRA ambush the Brits and wipe them all out. This is based on the Kilmicheal ambush which actually happened and was one of the most successful IRA actions during the war.

However, what you don't see in the film is that after the battle, their captain (Barry as I recall?) ordered them to shoot every dead and injured British soldier in the head to make sure they were killed.

One soldier managed to escape during the battle and so two unarmed volunteers were sent after him. They convinced him they had a gun and took him back to the column where he was then executed.

After all this the column were all so ditraught, and moral was so low, their captain ordered them all into formation (you see a bit of this in the film) and marched them up and down the street  for up to an hour in order to restore discipline.

I remain a committed Republican and attend Easter commemorations, however sometimes I feel that film tends to put al the cold brutality in the hands of the British, when the Irish dealt it out just as cruelly sometimes.

Lastly...can we please lock down more on FAQs. You know...those ones that are asked twice a day that are already in the FAQ? Likewise to guys who actually submit stuff: how about some useful post titles for people to actually be able to search?

For many people trains are utterly essential, they're basically a captive market and will be forced to pay the hiked fares no matter how outrageous they become because the alternative is losing their jobs.

I also don't understand why first class tickets are sometimes quadruple the cost of standard tickets. It's not making a damn difference to the cost of getting a train from point A to point B because the first class coaches are there anyway. What they should consider doing is lowering prices across the board - if first class becomes more affordable for people who are traveling for leisurely purposes and whatnot, they might consider picking it. There's no point having multiple empty first class coaches if people aren't able to bloody use them. So cheaper first class tickets may be *more* profitable because more people will buy them and it can off-set lowering the cost of standard tickets for commuters and daily travelers.

There also needs to be more schemes in place *for* daily commuters, such as a weekly pass that is slightly cheaper than paying for 5 return tickets.

true,emericuh,lfcflame,,"Most on this subreddit have never lived in Liverpool or even visited, but pretend to be experts on the rivalry that exists there. I've heard many Americans even call Everton their ""second favourite team,"" which to a native Scouser is about the most absurd thing I've ever heard. First, there is no such thing as a ""second team"" and if there was, it sure as fuck wouldn't be Everton, and I come from a whole family of blue noses. **As Bill Shankly once said, ""If Everton were playing at the bottom of the garden, I'd pull the curtains.""**

First, despite what the media portrays as the modern reaction to Hillsborough, many Evertonians resent Liverpool deeply for what happened. It led to the English football ban from UEFA competition and that period featured what was probably the best Everton team in history. They almost certainly would have been able to compete for a European title and that opportunity was taken away from them. 

Second, the only reason the intensity of the rivalry has subsided in recent years is because neither club has been competing at the top for the same trophies. When both clubs were at the top of football, the stakes were much higher and the passions were far more intense. Growing up in the eighties in Liverpool, when both teams were at their peak, I assure you that it wasn't the ""Friendly Derby"".

Finally, I hate the Mancs and their prawn sandwich supporters, but most are not out there chanting this vile shit. A handful of supporters shouldn't give you an impression of one of the best supported clubs in the world.

By extension you are proclaiming Assange's guilt. I'm quite happy for Assange to go to court, but the funny thing is that one of the 'victims' will likely not even be there (she did not even sign her testimony!). However, the inconvenient truth is the US is a ferral state wanting Assange's blood, and that is not hyperbole. Ecuador has given Assange asylum, another inconvenient truth. Eventually when the Wikileaks proceedings in the US playout they will become obvious and you change your mind, or they become benign, then Ecuador has no just (I don't care for legal because it is meaningless) claim that Assange needs protection.

The correct course of action isn't to send 35 police into the Ecuadorean embassy in the middle of the night (~12am) to try and bully a foreign nation into accepting the will of the foreign office. It's funny because Pinochet was able to avoid extradition one more reason why 'the law' is irrelevant.

* Amy's wait was 36 years.

He was completely prepared, even having weapons to defend the box with. On top of all that, he was plastic, so he didn't have many human needs (sleeping, eating, etc.). Amy, on the other hand, was *trapped against her will* in a hostile alien environment.

true,polostring,null,null,"* I think Carroll is content but not necessarily happy or sad.  LFC are a huge club and with all the recent changes there is a gaping hole full of opportunities to be a star here.

* I think he *does* regret his move.  It was much easier to be a hero and be loved up north and he has obviously not preformed as well.  That said, time can ease or change this regret.

* Young, talented, strong, great size, good passer, good finisher, British; there is most definitely a place for him on this team. (especially with the lack of finishing talent at the moment)

* No matter what, I think he will improve.  But, he will suffer if it is not enough for him to see significant time on the pitch

* If Liverpool develop an *efficient* set of 2-3 strikers that routinely score goals, but doesn't include Carroll, then I think a loan could be wonderful...with the following caveats:

     * These efficient strikers must come quickly.  If LFC is struggling to find their go to man up top, Carroll's variety and competition at training will be helpful.  He could end up that go to guy sooner rather than later.

     * Careful thought needs to be put into the team he is loaned to.  If he goes to some run-of-the-mill long ball team, it will send the message that LFC are just trying to find a way to take care of his wages until they can offload him.  If he goes to a team that plays a similar quick-pass/tiki-taka/etc. as Rodgers wants to play it could be a great development chance.

Regrets? Probably. Look at how tough it was for him last season. I'm sure seeing Newcastle make LEAPS above us didn't help. It's tough when you're a kid.

Place in the team? Absolutely. We've all seen what he's capable of - in form, he's one of the best aerial threats in the world. We've also seen glimpses of what he can do - he CAN have great control on the ball and excellent passing, it's a matter of nurturing it. I feel that he could win the Golden Boot in Europa this season if Downing hits a hot streak.

Benefit of a loan? No. Unless it's to Spain, I see no benefit. Carroll has only improved since February and I firmly believe he can learn a lot, especially from a man like Rodgers.

true,NFAK,lfc68,,"- He seems happy at the moment. He seems to have friends in the squad, since many of them are a similar age group. Carroll's happiness in the future depends vastly on whether he gets to play or not. Furthermore, whether he plays well or not. Success = Happiness, in this case.

- Don't think he regrets it. He's had a year and a half to settle into LFC. His latest statements didn't sound like he regrets it, so there is no reason to believe so.

- If BR is adamant on developing the team with his brand of football, then no. Carroll would fit into and develop into a much better player in various other teams, but he just isn't the kind of quick and agile player that this playing style requires. While he might have shown glimpses of quick feet in the final few games of the previous season, there is no guarantee of him continuing that level of form.

- If BR stops picking him as a starting 11 player, and demotes his position in the squad to cup games and Europa, then it could either be really bad for his self confidence, or he could take on the positives and develop himself into a fitting puzzle piece.

- If he is loaned to a team that is performing on a similar skill level to LFC or higher, then fine. Otherwise, I don't see the point. 23 years of age is the perfect age for him to grow into his potential. A season or 2 wasted of loaning him here and there without any significant improvement would only lower his value. Sell him for *at least* 18mil, with targets already lined up to reinvest in. Otherwise, BR should keep him and develop him with his full belief in him. I'm quite worried about this whole *'he knows where he stands'* business that BR keeps saying about AC.

Who and by what source? There are sources and behaviour that contradict this.

&gt; Sweden is safer for Assange than the UK, which is in turn safer than Ecuador.

Ecuador is actually protecting Assange from extradition, he has been given asylum, so this point is incontestable. Assange has the most protection at present under Ecuadorean jurisdiction.

&gt; So your point is that Assange is behaving like Pinochet.

A convenient misreading that betrays your prejudice. The foreign office if it wanted to can look the other way and deny extradition.

&gt; ...but he can't be arrested.

Because he is now out side the jurisdiction of the UK. He is now under house arrest indefinitely so you should be happy, it's a worse punishment than perhaps a fine and the maximum sentencing that could have happened in Sweden. He's already had 3 weeks restricted movement in Sweden, several days in solitary confinement, many months living a tagged nearly house arrest existence in the UK and now many weeks under house arrest in Ecuador.

Why would he avoid a simple trail where the evidence is in his favour (unsigned testimony, deleted tweets, and police transcripts), which would see a derisory sentencing if any, and choose what we have witnessed without good cause?

Few people have the time to write such a detailed missive.

Even if they do, government consultations are there to give nay-sayers something to chew on; a way to let off steam. If they do read any submissions, it will be those from big business. Anything from plebs like us will be filed under B for Bin.

And, if the Committee is anything like the one set up to look into Lords reform, it will have been given a limited remit to ensure that it comes up with the answer the government wants.

On past form, both main parties will be in favour of such a bill. The only way to sway them is the threat of losing public opinion.

“Well first of all, tell me: Is there some society you know that doesn’t run on greed? You think Russia doesn’t run on greed? You think China doesn’t run on greed? What is greed? Of course, none of us are greedy, it’s only the other fellow who’s greedy. The world runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests. The great achievements of civilization have not come from government bureaus. Einstein didn’t construct his theory under order from a bureaucrat. Henry Ford didn’t revolutionize the automobile industry that way. In the only cases in which the masses have escaped from the kind of grinding poverty you’re talking about, the only cases in recorded history, are where they have had capitalism and largely free trade. If you want to know where the masses are worse off, worst off, it’s exactly in the kinds of societies that depart from that. So that the record of history is absolutely crystal clear, that there is no alternative way so far discovered of improving the lot of the ordinary people that can hold a candle to the productive activities that are unleashed by the free-enterprise system.” - Milton Friedman. 

What we need is better regulation of our railway system, not a policy of increasing prices by the rate of inflation + 3%. We've tried nationalisation before and it didn't work out all that well, if we want to improve business confidence and attract investors from overseas, I doubt nationalising industries will make the flock over here/choose to invest.

Out wide, we've got Bale, Lennon, Townsend, and Bentley? We need a winger. We can't afford Townsend to be a regular starter as soon as Lennon does his hammy, and we're joking if we think he won't.

Striker, everyone knows. We can't afford to have more than a game or two here and there without Ade. We need someone who can back him up.

Bentley and Jenas are nowhere near good enough, even for the bench, and we've gotten rid of players who were good enough without replacing anyone. We need 4 more players, realistically, to consider this a successful transfer window. We will have regressed if this is not the case by the 31st.

true,johnny_seven,null,null,"I was there, Wolves played very well. Admittedly it's a poor Barnsley side but I am still very impressed. 

The passing game in particular was a delight to behold, haven't seen attacking football like that at the Molineux for a while (and I say this as a big MM fan) and it was clear it made a good impression on the crowd. Although there were nervous jitters at times the atmosphere was good overall and allowed the players to get on with the match, neither Berra and Jarvis were booed for their recent transfer requests.

Players that stood out were: 

SEB - Took his goal extremely well just like the SEB of old would and also set up Ward's goal. His off the ball work as well was very good and important as he tracked back often and made some good tackles.

Doumbia - Keep up this kind of performance and he could be key to our season's fortunes. Strong and confident, holds the ball up well and ran himself so far into the ground it's going to take archeologists several millennia before they dig up his fossil.

Johnson - Looks a new player, strong and marshalled the defence very well. Linked up decently with Berra as well could be extremely important this season. Also had a good rapport with the crowd.

Peszko - This guys overall game is very impressive, makes very quick runs up the wing but also not afraid to put in a tackle and looks strong when holding the ball. His cross for Edward's goal was sublime and leaves me thinking 'Michael who?'

Defensively the same old problems reared their ugly heads, I'm hoping that one or two signings at the back should solve this..the goal we let in was sloppy but it was nice to see SS was rightly annoyed by it and I hope he gave them a roasting for it afterwards.

The real test will come over the next few weeks starting with Derby on saturday but if we control the match like we did during our more positive moments we could be in for a treat this season.

Ps: look at the system requirements for the games (on their store pages) before purchasing so that you aren't left with an unusable product. The weeping angel entity is located in the toybox during gameplay. While playing hold Q and click on the tab labeled toybox in the upper left area of the screen. The page may take a while to load but once it does just click entities on the page and scroll down until you find the weeping angel. Click it to download it into the game, click the heart to save it to your favorites, an remember that when you die in game your toybox mods will disappear and you'll have to click them again in toybox to reactivate them (making the favorites tab in the toybox site very useful).

I'll add links in a second.

Doumbia was a different class though.  Solid defensively, powerful going forward and great on the ball.  Could definitely make our season. 

Agree with Johnson too, he won everything in the second half and I thought Ward grew into the game and, as was the case last season, when him and Jarvis link up on the left we tend to get into great positions.

I'm feeling fairly optimistic now.  As time goes on the confidence will grow, a couple of signings here and there and we're ready to go.

The Merseyside Rivalry is very different to the famous rivalries - say Glasgow Celtic, City United, River-Boca. Because Liverpool and Everrton have the same fanbase, the grounds are in the same location, there is no religious, location or cultural underpinning for why some people support one or the other.

&gt; As Bill Shankly once said, ""If Everton were playing at the bottom of the garden, I'd pull the curtains.""

Everyone knows the famous quotes Shankly had to say about Everton, but everyone also knows that this conceals the deep affection Shankly had for Everton. Shankly lived in Liverpool and after retiring, he regularly went to Everton training ground to watch the team play. His animosity towards Everton, just like the vast majority, was light-hearted and a jest, as opposed to some burning hatred that other fans have.

Hillsborough is not the reason English clubs were banned from UEFA, that was Heysel. At no point, from the very second it happened through to today, has there been a widespread or official position of Everton Football club that was anything other than supportive. Hillsborough wasn't a LFC tragedy, it was a Liverpool tragedy. Evertonian families just lost as many of their loved ones as LFC families - there aren't long lineages of Reds or Blues onlys, there are always intermingled. Furthermore, the immediate demonisation of football ""hooligans"" after Hillsborough, was seen as a sleight against all scousers, not just LFC fans. And Evertonians boycott the Sun just as much as LFC fans.


As for the ""prawn sandwich supporters"" jibe against ManU supporters, this sort of thing really rankles me. It shows a complete misunderstanding of the working class roots of the North-west and the reason we actually have a rivalry with Man Utd. I strongly recommend everyone reads this article about this very issue, written by a Manc no less.

true,roobens,lfc87,null,"True to an extent, but I'd disagree with the 25% estimate. Our lack of success in recent years certainly doesn't make us a *overall* threatening rival. But Fergie himself still claims that LFC v MUFC is the biggest football game in the world, and the most bitterly contested rivalry in England, even without us being successful. Since Fergie is their God, it's safe to say a lot of their fans mirror his attitude. And as the past few games have shown, we are certainly capable of burning the form book when it comes to games against them so we're threatening in the short-term at the very least. Also, don't know about you, but my MUFC friends spend a *lot* of time talking about Liverpool! Just not as much as EFC! 

You also have to remember that MUFC took over LFC's position as the most successful league club. For years they strived to take our crown. This history doesn't parallel with Everton/LFC. There's no achievement rivalry there.
 

Overall I'd say that it *is* a more intense rivalry on both sides than the EFC/LFC one, but as with the EFC/LFC rivalry, perhaps slightly more comes from our side.

true,arksien,tennant,Tennant,"No, yours is a bad comparison, and you're a bad moderator, and here's why:

1) My comparison involved banning content relivent to the media. People at a convention will come to cosplay, telling them they can't do certain things because they are ""over done"" and therefor ""bad content"" is exactly like what you've done here. No one is posting Berenstain Bears on this sub, it's all Dr. Who related. It's just not related in the way **YOU** want. If someone comes here posting something about Star Trek and you delete it, fine, because it's not Dr. Who. This would be anagolous to your example. However that's not what we're talking about. A better example would be someone showing up to a sci-fi book club in a costume derived from the book to show their love for the book, and being thrown out because ""this is a place to talk about books only. There is no room for any other form of appreciation.""

2) Reddit is a democracy. People upvote what they like, downvote what they don't. If something is on the front page, it's because more people liked it than not. Don't like something on the front? That's fine! It's an opinion, but you're in the minority, and that's just life sometimes. **BUT OH WAIT,** I forgot, you're a mod! Don't like being in the minority? Change the rules! Now only things you like are allowed, you *must* be in the majority because everything else is outlawed! ""Oh, but the community wants this!"" No, if the majority of the community hated meme's, there wouldn't ever be any because 1) no one would make them and 2) the few posted would be downvoted to oblivion. The fact that they exist suggests otherwise. What you are doing is fascist, and because of reddit's voting system, any argument trying to validate your opinion is a non-starter, because the evidence directly exists to oppose you.

3) You refuse to look at things objectively. You have assigned clear weight and preference to a certain kind of user. You gave them the primary voice when looking for a way to silence the type of subscriber that you don't like. The truth is, to be truly objective, you let the community decide. How do you do this? Let Reddit do it's thing! Upvotes and down votes! ...of course, when that was the system, *you* didn't win, so lets just change the rules instead!

4) And finally, you run the board like a Dalek. ""All content that does not fit into the moderator view of perfection will be exteeeeeerminated!"" You didn't win in the popular vote, so you just changed the rules so you'd win. Enjoy your sub, it will be custom tailored to your own little dream world, and everyone else? Who cares!?

He's been cowardly, he's been brave, he's been witty, and he's been grave. He's been all across the board on these things but one constant is that the Doctor can never be truly considered as ""mild"". No matter which Doctor you look at he's this incredible person overflowing with character.

The Doctor is this personification of someone with unfathomable freedom. Someone who is not bound by the limits of space and time and is able to (and does) do whatever he pleases.

And yet the Doctor will still remain (albeit sometimes grayly) on the side of good. He has all of the freedom to do whatever he pleases and escape any consequences and yet still will fight for freedom over slavery, imagination over oppression, and intelligence over brutality.

The Doctor is this incredibly extreme character capable of traversing the fantastic and exploring the amazing. He's larger than life and so are his adventures, and that's a major part of the character's appeal.

To me the Doctor is less of a person and more of an idea. He's one part madcap two parts genius and witty to taste. He's like Father Christmas, an icon of timeless magic.

I found it interesting to go back and see how selfish and grumpy the first doctor was. It seemed like he was willing to abandon people at every turn. He seemed like a cynical scientist, more interested in gathering data and seeing the sights, with no concern for the repercussions it caused. Fast forward to Eccleston and we see a *slightly* friendlier doctor, but with a LOT of pain locked up inside. It's like we're watching that same angry old man trying to be someone different. Eccleston, to me, represents a momentous turning point for the doctor. This is a man who's lost his entire planet and can either give in to his pain and hatred or rise above the experience. Bad Wolf was always a great finale to me because it presented the doctor with the choice of destruction in the name of the greater good, or faith in the individual ideal.

Tennant shows up right after the doctor makes a huge change in character and to me is the manifestation of the doctor's newfound faith. We now have someone willing to sacrifice himself, someone who refuses to even *touch* a gun. Life is something sacred to him.  Even so, we still see the doctor slipping in to his bits of rage now and then. For an example, just watch The Runaway Bride again. The doctor goes absolutely insane at the end of that episode.

I feel like Matt is a bipolar version of Tennant. He's far more whimsical but also more condescending to others. What links the three of them is their genuine recognition of the past. Regardless of each doctor's style or appearance, they're all stopped dead in their tracks at the mention of the Time War or Gallifrey. They get this empty look on their face and we as a viewer remember all the doctor's been through.

The doctor, to me, is someone on the run. Sometimes it's by going to a different place, sometimes it's by changing his face. But there are always the memories, the pain of what he's lost. But in spite of it all, he keeps fighting. Because he believes, in spite of all he's lost, that there's so much more to gain.

I'd like you to think about it from a point of view of noise to signal ratio. Imagine, if you will, that news that Doctor Who will be starting on September 16th is drowned out by pictures of David Tennant crying in the rain. 

This in fact has happened, which prompted the experiment of the meme-free week. We use meme in a very scientific context: a virus of the mind. 

While we agree that 50000 people thought that Blink was scary (and it was, I get creeped out when The Time of Angels play). Now, this idea has gripped all of us. It is a very common thing to want to share it. It's like a virus. And yes we, as a species feel comfort in sharing our discomforts.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"If given the choice between having 11 top class players of varying nationalities who give their all but play for the money or having 11 mediocre English players who give top effort and play for the shirt, I know which one I'd choose in a heartbeat.

Even many of the players that profess to love a club have proven to be full of shit once money or trophies came knocking. Players like de Rossi and Totti and Le Tissier and King -- top class players who have played for one club their entire life in spite of not winning tons of trophies (I know Totti and DDR have won a few but they could have certainly had many more elsewhere) -- are staggeringly rare. I believe van Persie said just a year ago that he only wanted to win trophies with Arsenal. Modric once said he only wanted to play in Spain if it was a Champions League away tie with Spurs. 

This is why, to me, it can be difficult to put a lot of stock in somewhat abstract things like loyalty and attitude--particularly when they apply to players who aren't exactly world beaters. This doesn't mean we don't want high-character men in our ranks; it simply means that within reason the most important things we need to look at are ability and whether or not a player is suited to a role in our club. 

A poster from a Spurs board I read made a great post about funneling rage towards the structure of English football as opposed to Levy or our manager. It would be much easier to field a more home-grown team if the country developed more quality players. As it is now, it's simply more financially and competitively viable to look abroad. We bought Jan Vertonghen for probably half the price it would have taken to snag a similarly quality English defender. 

I'd love to have a team full of great players who genuinely love and play 100% for the shirt, but the #1 thing needs to be the best interest of the club.

And as for car insurance, I honestly don't think insurance premiums have ANY bearing on my driving at all. I definitely wouldn't drive without a car in the world even if my insurance was free. Car accidents kill people every day, not to mention all of the long-term injuries and pain which result from non-fatal accidents. 

Not to mention that driving offences would still exist under the new system, so it wouldn't give you free reign to speed, run red lights and drive after a few pints.

And finally, I'd guess that the 1 millions non-insured drivers are probably the ones who don't give a shit. They're likely in cheap shitty cars too and if any of them hit you, you're in trouble because they don't have any insurance to pay for your car damage.

Additionally we don't actually see the woman from the Doctor Dances without her leg and she has one line at the tailend of an episode. However we do see Dr. Constantine with a cane, so that's something.

In fact there are plenty of nice characters with canes (and evil, mind you). Hell, the Doctor himself has used a cane more than once, oftentimes using his umbrella as a cane and later using a sonic cane after being crippled by poison.

Another ""crippled"" character I think is worth mentioning is Cassandra, who has confined herself to a trampoline frame due to her need for life. The Master also will be effectively crippled as he clings to life, either as a creepy skeleton-flesh thing or as a CGI snake in a decomposing body.

Actually, come to think of it... almost all of these crippled characters have this weird relationship with death, mostly prolonging it unnaturally and turning evil to either combat it or rule it. 

Is the subcontext here that those who would continue their lives while crippled must be unnatural? Those who are scarred, maimed, crippled who continue to force themselves into life are inherently evil and bitter at what made them that way? (Davros at all life, Cassandra at the cross-breeding humans)

Just a thought. The interesting thing here isn't really the lack of good guys in wheelchairs but more the abundance of bad guys in wheelchairs.

Others, like 3, 4, and 10 tend to have much more straightforward morality, being more upfront about their opinions and pretty much calling it like they see it.  

And it seems to me that a lot of these transformations in personality relate directly to events that had been going on in their lives.  Each regeneration seems to be a ""response"" to what happened before.  Happy-Go-Lucky Two goes too far, ends up getting banished to Earth, and regenerates as a self-important ""tenured professor"" type who seems to regard his own research (mostly into getting the TARDIS running again) as the most important aspect of his life.  Then, when he does get free, he turns into the bohemian, laid-back Four, who seems much better-suited to *enjoying* the freedom he regained.

Or, after the somewhat cruel and unbalanced Six, he comes back with much of Six's cunning, but in a package that's more light-hearted and good-natured, eventually forming a tight mentor-like bond with his main companion that's practically the polar opposite of Six's relationship to Peri.

And, of course, it's not at all hard to read the 9, 10, 11 progression as him going through PTSD, eventually going more than a bit insane before finally getting over it, followed by a somewhat more childish outlook where he refuses to take as much responsibility on himself as his predecessor.

For the modern series, the 9th doctor was comparatively harsh, almost cruel, definitely less compassionate. He'd been hurt too much by his past, and withdrew, refusing to care about what happened around him. Rose saved him, and made him care again. He came out of his shell, and the moment he made that decision to care again, he became a new person. Literally. :P

The 10th doctor is the exploration of how caring affects him. Not only does he start to interfere a lot more, and not only does he accept responsibility for so many more people, but he visibly and seriously *hurts* every time someone else is lost or hurt because of being involved with him/whatever goes on around him. He's dealing with the positives and negatives of learning to care again. This development is amazing, watching him enjoy the opportunity to live, to love, and to befriend people, to have people care about him. But we also have to watch him learn to lose people, to learn to grieve.

The 11th doctor has found that so much pain and guilt is just impossible to deal with. He can never stop moving, never stop running, and never EVER stop to look back, or the guilt and pain of every mistake and action with unintended consequences will crush him completely. He laughs at every little joke, he's always looking for the next adventure, and he tries to save everyone he can, to redeem himself from everything he considers himself responsible for.

He's very similar to Adam Johnson, actually. He is single-minded. Likes to take his man on and either get a (usually shitty) cross in from the byline or likes to cut onto his right foot and shoot. He almost always plays on the left and doesn't have the best final ball. His defensive work rate is not strong. I would classify him more as a wide forward than a natural winger. I certainly wouldn't play him as a left wingback over natural left-sided players like Aleks or Clichy. 

That's not to say he's not talented. He's a crafty dribbler and can score some freakishly good solo goals. Maybe Mancini can get the best out of him. He was terrifying in the Championship but I can probably name 5-6 players that had bigger impact than he last season for Swansea.

I haven't watched through most of the original series more than the once in total (though I did watch some of my favorite parts a lot more), so my recollection of what happens is fuzzy, but a large part of it is actually him changing his opinion on the rest of the universe, and finding something to do. He's a scientist in part, discovery is his bent for a long while, and he's gaining in knowledge and influence as he develops.

He starts seeing the rest of the universe as inferior and unimportant except as a curiosity. As he learns more about how it works, and how to understand it, he learns to accept and to even like it. He takes a lot longer to learn to respect it, but that comes too.

He also has to learn to change his opinion of the time lords, too, and we all know how that ends up, sad as it is.

In the case of Richardson v.

Further Zuko has a massive burn across the side of his face, which he carries for the entirety of the series. Although the scar holds many levels of meanings for him and the moment he was scarred vastly changed his character he ultimately develops as a good person who is not defined by their scar.

“You and I both know, don't we Rose? The Doctor is worth the monsters... One may tolerate a world of demons for the sake of an angel.” – Madame de Pompadour

Oh where to begin? The Girl in the Fireplace was the first adventure with that Doctor that threw me into fits of laughter, sent shivers down my spine, and shed tears from my eyes, all in one episode.

From the very first scene, I had always thought that the juxtaposition of a futuristic spaceship three thousand years in the future with 18th century France was simply brilliant. The clockwork droids remain one of my all-time favourite Doctor Who monsters: an entire creature built from an intricate collection of gears camouflaged in the attire of Pre-Revolutionary France. The frightening nature of their “objective” brought a strong wave of chills, and their frankly unsettling appearance disturbed me to the core. For me, they were just as scary as the Weeping Angels or the gasmasks from The Empty Child.

But that was just the start, Russell T Davies described the episode as “practically a love story,” and I have to agree. The inter-temporal relationship between the Doctor and Reinette was beautifully done, and made me realize just how lonely the Doctor really is. Appearing briefly in various moments of her life, a proper French noblewoman falls in love with her imaginary childhood friend who disappears for years at a time. Sound familiar? Yes, Madam de Pompadour will always be the original “girl who waited” in my eyes. The scene of the Doctor’s final visit to Versailles always sends me to tears, and truthfully gave a glimpse into the burdens of a Time Lord.

What really made this episode a favourite of mine was the stunning performances by both David Tennant (who also happens to be my favourite Doctor) as well as Sophia Myles, and its outstanding writing. It was so difficult to choose just one quote from this episode because nearly every line had me shaking with excitement. Critics say that this episode suffered due to its limited time constraint, but I think Moffat executed it perfectly, without it feeling at all shallow or forced.

Watching The Girl in the Fireplace was one of those surprises that you’d never expect from a television program aimed at younger audiences. It was bold, elegant, and masterfully done; a surreal experience that immersed me in a fantastic world that I never wanted to leave. This is the kind of adventure that will keep me coming back for another 50 years.

As for Teo, him being a paraplegic does add an element of story to show. It brings out his ambition and persistence, as well as his strong relationship with his father, after he built him a custom glider so that he would not feel disabled in the sky.

Toph's blindness contributes greatly to the story's plot. Growing up, Toph was constantly treated with as an inferior, someone who needed constant protection because of her disability. Her overprotective parents wouldn't even let her out of the house. This resulted in her striving to become more independent and have a tough skin, often making her look almost barbaric (in a comedic way).

A superb example is with Barbra Gordon. For the longest time she was Batgirl and fought alongside Batman on many adventures until one day she was shot in the spine by the Joker and permanently paralyzed.

But I think the point of this video is that in many times these character's disabilities not only affect the course of their life, but define them and their actions until they are consumed with blind obsession, hate, and bitterness and attempt to murder thousands in ""revenge"".

In Barbra's case her becoming paralyzed was devastating, but she didn't give up nor turn to evil.

true,BrokenClockwerk,lfc50,,"I agree on some points, but disagree on a lot of others. We can't expect to craft a title-winning squad (or even a team that challenges for top 4) on the strength of Adam Morgan and Jonjo Shelvey. Are they great youth players? Absolutely. Should they be given time in cups and Europe (and even some PL games for Shelvey)? Definitely. They are the future of the club, yes, but it's absurd to expect them to be stars today.

Putting Shelvey in over Lucas, Allen, or Gerrard weakens the squad. Putting Morgan in over someone like Suarez, Carroll or Borini DRASTICALLY weakens the squad. Yes, the young guys need to be competing for bench spots and substitute appearances and we can't just let players like Downing and Cole get starts even if they fail, but there's a reason the league isn't dominated by talented 18 year olds.

Shelvey deserves some play time this season, but Sterling and Morgan are both too raw to expect much out of right now and throwing them into the Premier League, where they will be playing against players like Kompany and Cahill, might be too much for them right now. At this point in their development, it might be better for them and the club if they don't hit the ground running and instead gradually work their way into the club's plans.

true,justabitmoresonic,rory,Rory,"SEMI-SPOILERS FOR SEASON 5 AND 6

This is my favourite story of all the series. I loved it the first time I watched it because of many reasons:

The bad guy is never really defeated. The Doctor isn't all powerful and sometimes he can't get rid of the monster, he just has to make it think he can.

I love ten and donna in this episode. They are great friends and nothing more.

It allows me to think that regardless of what the writers believe, The Doctor doesn't believe in a god or the afterlife otherwise he wouldn't have needed to save River in the way that he did. He was just saving her consciousness which would be the same as Heaven as seen by Christians. The Doctor is all for science and that's the way it should be.

River Song is the best in this episode. There is no other episode in which I like her more.

Foreshadowing... it's my favourite thing ever.

What I love most about this episode is that the first time you watch it, it is quite sad and you feel bad about River dying but you don't really see how sad it actually is. When you go back and watch it after series 5 and 6 you get super sad because The Doctor feels the way you felt the FIRST time you watched the episode, but he really should feel the way you felt after knowing her for so long afterwards. He should be sadder than he is and it's upsetting.

But to me, I see the different incarnations as the same, person but always different.  As Ten might say, ""New face, new Doctor--*well*, same Doctor, different quirks.""

I see the Doctor as a warrior and a healer, a guardian and a saint.  I see him as a wall, built up over hundreds of years against the darkness and the decay of stagnant time.  Because no matter what, he always has someone with him, to remind himself, and us as viewers, that the Doctor has lived for hundreds of years and can persist for hundreds more--but we can't.  He is the reminder that we are temporary, and that we need to take every day as it's supposed to be taken: as an adventure through time and space.  

In 6 seasons, I've watched him rise up and chase armies away, and I've seen him fall and lose everything.  In all six seasons, in all three faces, I've seen something that all three actors have gotten so very right:  the Doctor's lonely eyes.  Because even after you see all that alien technology, and learn about the two hearts, and the regenerations, and TARDIS, and everything else that makes him so far-flung from human, there's always one thing that makes him the Doctor:

If you hand your physical CV to a person and engage them in conversation, build up a bit of rapport, show that you're keen and presentable and enthusiastic... Offer to do a free work trial! As an agency, we get a lot of placements for candidates by offering a free work trial instead of an interview for the lower-level positions.  

When you see the adverts, how about physically going to the places rather than just calling or e-mailing?

If you're not confident, any agency worth their salt (pick a small, lesser heard of one rather than a big high street one) will help you with interview coaching and skills.

Rumours that WorstGroup has undercut Virgin's bid for the next west-coast franchise prompted Richard Branson to remind Daft that the east-coast franchise had twice been awarded to firms which came ""nowhere close to delivering their promised plan"".

He's right: and east-coast is not the only example.

In 1997 a 15-year franchise deal was founded on the winning bidder's promise to increase revenue by so much it would fund a 140mph upgrade with enough left over to pay Daft £1.2bn. But the ""promised plan"" was so unrealistic Daft gave huge bailouts for the franchise and upgrade (diluted to 125mph). Beardie didn't mention that cautionary tale - perhaps because the deal, for the west-coast franchise, was landed by Virgin Rail (prop: R Branson).

I quite enjoy the silly, fun, quirky ""ode (not ood) to Who"" that the memes and pics allow. It makes me smile to see other fans sharing their love of the show without having to have an in-depth, contemplative conversation about each episode.

For the record: I, like thousands of others, became a fan of the show after being forced to watch ""Blink"", it is and always will be one of the best episodes and shame on this sub for trying to shut down new whovians from expressing their fear and amazement at the weeping angels because they are hipsters that want to feel superior because they have know about the show longer.

true,kggyrr,pertwee,Pertwee,"Background: For the TV series, I've seen the modern three doctors, then a couple of stories of 2 and 4, currently following 3; I've only read one novel of 9 and one of 10. 

I can connect to all of those except for 3. I'm finishing Pertwee's first season and still warming up to him. 2, 4, and 11 all have their eccentricities that fit the kind of Doctor I imagined. Love the nickname ""space hobo"" for 2 (and 11 by association), because that's really what the Doctor is. He bumbles around and makes things up as he goes. 4 is just so unpredictable and wacky that the kid in me loves to have him around for giggles. 3 is a bit, hmm I can't find a proper adjective for him, orthodox? Nothing up to *Inferno* has surprised or wowed me. Sure there's the Whomobile and karate chops, but the props and signature moves don't hold much sentimental values to me unless they're things like the TARDIS or 10's go-to bad news delivery.  

Upon first viewing new Who, I just fangirled all over 10 and went through emotional ups and down with him. Then repeat viewings and Classic Who taught me that the Doctor is definitely not the nice one. He has lots of blood in his hands, directly or indirectly: he has fought in wars; he has turned his companions into warriors themselves; when UNIT uses gunfire to solve problems we often only get a few verbal disapproval from the Doctor. But has he truly cared? As Captain Adelaide Brooke points out, some lives are smaller than others to the Timelord Victorious. Does that make him a monster?

I mostly overlooked 9 first time around and didn't understand his anger, but it was also partly due to the fact that I couldn't take the show seriously yet. And then 10's melancholy helped me understand 9, that the line ""Everybody lives!"" was such a milestone in 9's journey. He loathed himself for the monstrosity he committed, about flipped every table upon seeing the lone Dalek, and barely held onto his faith in ""stupid apes."" How much of the previous Doctors are we seeing here, considering his recent traumatic experience that is the Last Great Time War?

11 is a living meme. But that's fine as long as he keeps up with the whimsical adventures. It's hard to believe he's the same person as 3 the authoritative one or 10 the emo one. At least in the new series, one thing is consistent: lots of running. At times I miss the previous incarnation, but as soon as a running sequence or time vortex shot comes on, I enjoy the ride with the characters. That's how I cope. ""Hello, I'm the Doctor. Basically, run!"" *Okay!*",0,1345626130,null,0,false,0,c5wy6yg,t3_ym07i,t1_c5wy6yg,t3_ym07i,null,1429704481,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Abortion takes away even the chance of a biological or adoptive family to have that child.

I had so much fun discovering what they were actually like and how they developed over time.

I thought Two and Five would just be kind and gentle, and I was very pleasantly surprised at how fantastically rude and trickster-ish both could be. 

Leading up to Eleven, I was anxious to say the least, but he's just... the Doctor. A wonderful one. I guess the most difficult thing is going from a Doctor who's very open and welcoming, like Five, Eight and Ten, to one who's very guarded and keeps people at a distance, like Six, Nine and Eleven. For the young fans, Ten to Eleven is the first time we've experienced that change, and Eleven just seems so much more reluctant to let people get emotionally close than Ten was. I don't personally mind it, but I can understand why other people would.

Waiting for trains and buses sucks and having to base your schedule around the bus or train back is so shit. And if you're travelling at night, you'll probably be sharing with crazy shouting people. Not to mention the cost.. for two people or more, driving is cheaper than two train tickets. Buses are just as bad - uncomfortable, often filled with weird people, and you have to stand outside in the cold and rain to wait for them and they never show up on time anyway. My g/f won't take buses any more because several times weird guys have come and sit next to her and creep her out. Plus with chavs blasting dubstep on their phones, It's a horrible experience. Noisy, bone-rattling shaking, always late, windows steamed up on the inside, crying babies, charvers, old people who smell and charvers who yell and throw things. Fuck that!

Cars are awesome - convenient, comfortable, private and actually cheaper if you aren't by yourself. I put the AC or my heated seat on, play some music I like and follow my own schedule of when I want to set off or leave. Quality of life is way better too.. you can just pop out in the car to somewhere you've never been before. Since getting a car I see my friends more, visit my parents more, and do more social activities too. Like last week we drove to a farm shop in the middle of nowhere to buy food.. would be a total PITA by bus.

If anything, we should be making it easier for drivers since driving is by far the better option. We pay a fortune for fuel, road tax, parking and everything else. And the reason people keep paying the extortionate amounts is because driving is so much better than relying on buses. We should be improving roads and city centre parking since its clearly the option people want.

That's the description I was looking for! I really don't like ascribing psychological labels to fictional characters, but Eleven is just so very ""two-sided"", so constantly at war with himself. He can be very open and warm once second, and he can completely close down and start lying to everyone out of sheer self-loathing the next. Ten always stayed open to human contact, even in his most guarded moments. Whereas Eleven turns away from his friends the moment he gets moody, and can't function without some alone time every once in awhile.

&gt;London, 25 July 2012: MPs who vote for David Cameron's gay marriage pledge will be punished at the general election, says the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC) www.spuc.org.uk a leading pro-family campaigning group said today.

&gt;SPUC was responding to Mr Cameron's speech, reported by The Telegraph this morning http://goo.gl/fNQJn in which he promised to enshrine same-sex marriage in law before the next general election in 2015.

&gt;John Smeaton, SPUC's chief executive, commented: ""There are numerous reports that the Conservative party is already losing huge numbers of voters, members and activists because of Mr Cameron's foolish support of same-sex marriage. SPUC and its colleagues in many pro-family, Christian and Muslim groups, representing countless thousands of supporters and activists up and down the country, will ensure that same-sex marriage becomes a big general election issue, especially in marginal constituencies.

&gt;""Mr Cameron's speech reveals that his understanding of marriage and religion is woefully simplistic and ignorant. His mantra of 'equality' totally ignores the nature, history and role of marriage, which is the union of one man and one woman ordered towards the procreation of children.

&gt;""Redefining marriage to include same-sex couples is outside Mr Cameron's remit as a political leader. The family - not the government - is the first and vital cell and source of human society, and is therefore a pre-political institution. By seeking to redefine marriage, Mr Cameron is also seeking to redefine the family, which is based upon marriage between one man and one woman. Mr Cameron is clearly doing his best to copy Tony Blair as a social engineering guru"", concluded Mr Smeaton.",0,1345633352,null,0,false,0,c5wyvvb,t3_ylja4,t1_c5wyvvb,t3_ylja4,null,1429704807,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Pay should be high so that schools can be picky about who they hire and get the best people for the job, but they can't continue to live in an alternate reality where all skillsets are worth the same and all regions are paid the same.

There is an amazing book called ""Man's search for Meaning"" by Viktor Fankl, a psychiatrist from German in the early 20th Century, in it he talked about his times in concentration camps, but also about how hope and being able to attach meaning to one's suffering kept people going and helped them to survive. He also talks of seeing the hope go from people and then watching them die. 

It's not an easy read and it's very poignant, but it was one of the most important books I've read. Reminds me why hope is so important.

If you can't find time to shop in the other six days of the week (inc the 24 hour shops), or between 10-4 on a Sunday then you must be in the top percentile of Britain's busiest people. 

The history of this also counts too. When Sunday opening first began workers got double-time, which then ebbed down to time and a half, before being a standard's day pay with the threat of being fired if you didn't take it. 

The original chance was sold to HMG by saying that staff could have a voluntary chance to earn extra (now that has gone), whilst smaller shops wouldn't be wiped up by having to go go head to head seven days a week.

I ahve to say as an office gimp that it'll be nice if 9-5ers gave poorly paid retail staff a chance to take part in doing stuff with their families too.

true,AndorianBlues,k9,K-9,"I think the Doctor is, well, like Tom Bombadil in Lord of the Rings. He's some kind of fundamental force of the universe, and we can never really understand him or his role.

I also believe, like you, that all the Doctors are just as real. Even Lenny Henry, Mark Gatiss or other jokey Doctors. Joanna Lumley and Peter Cushing certainly, even the mysterious portraits of apparent pre-First Doctors in ""The Brain of Morbius"" could genuinely represent some aspect of the Doctor. And sure, the 8th Doctor was half human. And the Cushing Doctor was fully human. And the First Doctor looked like Richard Hurndall for a time. And Trevor Martin played the 3.5th Doctor. 

But what makes all these infinite Doctors the Doctor? I guess it must be his role in the story. The Doctor is always the main character, even if he isn't there. Daleks, Cybermen, even future Humans.. their history on the show is completely subservient to the Doctor's adventures. The Daleks have no coherent continuity at all, and they never will have, because it doesn't matter.

This isn't Star Trek or Star Wars where you have a carefully designed universe with rules. This is Doctor Who, where the universe revolves around one person in a blue box. Maybe it's like superhero comics, where whole cities like Metropolis basically exist to serve one character, and change frequently to adapt to the character. I think the whole DW universe does that.

This, by the way, also means, to me, that things like the Time War, UNIT dating, time locks et cetera are fun to speculate about, but ultimately irrelevant to the show at large.

And so far, I've not heard a single argument for a technical/legal solution to allow right-to-die, everything focuses on the moral or emotive arguments relating to individual cases.

true,DamnBittersweet,num26,,"I had a long Twitter conversation with a follow Spurs fan about Tommy yesterday, he of the opinion that Tommy should have developed more into the player we were expecting him to become by now - he's 25 - and that the players he's been compared to - Carrick, Hoddle, Scholes, etc. - were carrying teams by this point in their careers. He argued that, but for a couple of 'Hollywood' passes per match, there are too many deficiencies to his game.

You know what? He's probably right. Whilst I love Tom and you can argue that his development has been stilted by his recent injuries, he's only a year younger than Luka, who's been carrying us for a few seasons now. (When I say 'carrying', I don't mean that we're a one-man team, just a player capable of having the team built around them, or a highly influential one at the least.)

The other aspect is, whilst I think too much is being made at the moment of the new 'AVB system' and who can and cannot play under it, Tommy's biggest perceived weakness - his lack of pace - would be more shown up under a more pressing game.

But I'll miss him, and let's be realistic - for a not-young, not-developing player, a loan is the first step out the door. His passing range was a joy to behold, and, with everyone complaining about JDs inability to hold the ball up, it would have been nice to have Tommy there to put some of those great balls over the top of the defence for him to run onto - few did that better than him. But I keep getting told there's no room for sentimentality in football any more, sadly.

Good luck, Tommy.

""Julian Assange is accused of rape""

Isnt going to be, ""he took a woman home, had consensual sex with her, then later had sex with her while she was asleep until she woke up and they had consensual sex again and then she later decided she hadnt agreed to it""

or

""Julian tried to have sex without a condom, at first the woman said no but then agreed, enjoyed it and later decided she wanted to accuse him of rape""


The word rape is VERY powerful, and I think for most people conjures up highly violent images, or the use of a date rape drug, which I feel are a lot worse than what he is actually accused of.

Thats what I think he probably means when he says the use of the word rape ""bankrupts the meaning of the word""

While the definition of the word itself does cover everything Julian did. I think the definition in the majority of peoples minds is very different.

Im now going to get shouted at for trying to legitimise rape. No, im not, im saying that there are very different ""rape scenarios"" and some of them ARE a lot worse than others, from both the victims point, and the aggressors point.

Either way, George Galloway with his egotistical desire to be at the forefront of any public moment with the most rebellious view, has probably done a huge amount of damage to Assanges case and media representation.

But other than that, it's naive to think that these kids are ready - these kids have potential, but youth players typically aren't well-rounded, instead mostly just showing their quality in certain aspects - and it's becoming well-rounded which is the big step up many of them have to make in order to become first-team players. We've seen Shelvey bulk up compared to last season, and improve his defensive work rate; it's a start, but the quality of his defensive work still needs to match the quantity, and he's occasionally over-ambitious with his passing and decision-making. Rodgers has made comments about how Sterling has now begun to think more about contributing to the team than just his own performance - not knocking the lad, but that shows you what stage he's at in his development. 

First-team football should come their way this season, mostly outside of the league, but they've still got a lot to learn.

Couldn't you also say that people who eat lots of pizzas and pasties might even be more happy than people who struggle with diet and exercise for the good of their health? Same for smokers - most smokers I know still say they enjoy it, even though they know it's bad for them.

People who smoke or drink to excess are generally more susceptible to illness, disease, are less physically able, and on average, die younger than those that don't. They have a substantially reduced quality of life.

That detail doesn't carry across to the car insurance case.

&gt; And as for car insurance, I honestly don't think insurance premiums have ANY bearing on my driving at all.

The knowledge that a minor prang in a car park — if another party puts their foot down and insists it goes through insurance — could cost you thousands of pounds in increased premiums wouldn't make you drive that little bit more cautiously?

At the moment, with thousands of pounds on the line even if I find myself in a no-fault accident, I go that extra mile. I frequently find myself profiling other drivers (based on their car, its condition, their driving, etc.) and anticipating stupid moves they might pull. You'd be surprised how often those predictions come true. I take extra care to note sections of road where drivers frequently do daft things (e.g. a roundabout with confusing lane markings, a poorly signposted exit) and prepare for stupidity to ensue. Little things like that.

true,[deleted],null,null,"As a nurse in the NHS, these figures don't surprise me at all. The unit I work on is desperately short staffed with roughly half the number of nurses on each shift than we had this time last year. When people leave to go to another job, retire or get promoted they aren't replaced. Instead we're just expected to provide the same standard of care with fewer staff. This has led to a sharp increase in staff sickness as nurses become stressed out and physically run down from working longer hours with no time for breaks. This in turn leads to heavy reliance on agency staff who are expensive, unfamiliar with the ward environment and often don't give a shit, although there are exceptions of course. Unsurprisingly, morale is pretty low. People resent constantly coming in early/staying late to get jobs done and feel guilty that they don't have as much time to spend with patients as they should. Fortunately I work with a great team and we're pretty good at supporting each other when things are difficult. At the moment we're all working our arses off to make sure that the standard of care doesn't suffer due to poor staffing but I worry about the potential impact on patient safety. I'm afraid it will take a major incident for the powers that be to realise that the current situation is untenable.

true,NeoNerd,scot-Aberdeen,Aberdeenshire,"You've touched on part of the reasons why rape conviction rates are so low. Evidence tends to be seriously lacking. Most reported rapes take place in private, with only the complainer and the accused present. If promptly reported, there can be evidence of sexual intercourse. But the issue of consent is not easy to prove either way. Too often it becomes a ""he said, she said"" situation.

If these cases reach trial, they inevitably become an ordeal for the complainer. As lack of consent is founded solely on their word, the defense will likely have to discredit them as much as possible. This is obviously not pleasant - being accused of lying about rape is not nice. But it's often the only avenue of defence open.

In the case of unconsciousness, this is usually not actually sleep. The complainer will usually have been unconscious through alcohol or another drug. This is easier to prove, especially with some drugs. But it's still difficult. If two drunk people go home from a club, it can still be very difficult to show that the complainer became unconscious later. 

It's a very real problem for the legal systems of the UK. Proving rape to a court is extremely difficult. But there isn't an easy way to fix that without removing centuries old protections offered to accused people.

true,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,"&gt;However, royal aides are understood to have moved quickly to warn British media organisations not to republish the embarrassing photographs.

&gt;Royal aides are understood to be urging the British media to respect the prince's privacy and not republish the photographs, which are likely to have been taken without his consent.

&gt;Royal aides suggested that Clarence House may contact the Press Complaints Commission if the pictures are used by British publications. The PCC declined to confirm whether it had been contacted by Clarence House.

&gt;Each of the major British newspapers chose not to use them in online stories by late on Wednesday, although they were published by the Ireland-based Westminster gossip blog, Guido Fawkes.

&gt;The reticence of the British media is likely to be interpreted by some in the industry as further evidence of a chilling effect caused by the Leveson inquiry into media ethics. Tabloid executives, including the Sun editor Dominic Mohan and the Mail Online publisher Martin Clarke, have complained to the inquiry that they could be forced out of business if they are unable to publish material that is put online by media organisations in other countries and widely available on the internet.

&gt;The saga is reminiscent of the topless picture of Sophie, Countess of Wessex published by the Sun in 1999. The Sun's then editor, David Yelland, immediately apologised after Buckingham Palace accused the paper of ""premeditated cruelty"" and made a formal complaint to the PCC.

true,gary_rowe,devon,Devon,"Many people view banks as a place to keep their savings and to receive their paycheque. Direct debits run smoothly to pay the usual utility bills which saves us a lot of monthly hassle. We moan when something goes wrong and when something that should be simple and cheap is made complex and expensive. We almost never look beyond banks to see what alternatives are out there. 

Maybe we have a misplaced sense of trust that somehow the money we deposit with the banks is going to be safe under all circumstances. To a certain extent this is true, UK deposits are protected up to a limit of about £85,000 which is usually sufficient. There are caveats to that figure, but it's certainly reassuring that if a bank collapsed there is a form of insurance backed by the UK government to turn to in order to avoid financial ruin. Of course, if everyone is trying to get their money back at the same time it is doubtful that it would all get paid, hassle-free in a short space of time.

Now what if you're willing to look beyond the norm? A quick bit of searching and you'll quickly find Zopa - a website that provide a peer to peer lending facility. Essentially, if you have a surplus of money (savings) then you can loan it out through Zopa and get a much higher rate of interest than a bank can offer. You can choose your risk profile (only lending to A* credit worthy customers) but suffer a lower interest rate, or take on some higher risk people can get more. Your choice. If you're crafty you can use this as a cheap source of money that you can use to pay off higher interest loans elsewhere. 

If you do more searching, you'll find something even weirder: Bitcoin. It promises a way of being in control of your own money that has never existed before in all of history, and it's been delivering on that promise for over 3 years now 24/7. It's not for the faint hearted or impatient, but if you have an interest in how money actually works it's worth watching. Personally, I've learned a huge amount about what banks and credit cards do as a result - a real eye opener.

When I think of the two Angels episodes, my immediate feeling is to rave endlessly about what a brilliant ride they are.  

There's *so much* packed in there that it blows my mind: barely a second is wasted.  Lines like: ""A forest in a bottle on a space ship in a maze. Have I *impressed* you yet, Amy Pond?""  And Iain Glen as Octavian - he's so bloody good, I watched through the dullest bits of Game of Thrones just 'cos of him.  And Angel Bob, and comfy chairs, and blue boringers, and Mike Skinner, and the cracks in the universe, and the speech with the gun about the trap (with optional Graham Norton), and even a sublime bit of pretend continuity-fail that'll all make sense by the finale.

I think of the two Angels episodes, and I remember how much I love my Doctor Who: and how it is the greatest show in the universe.

We are delighted to confirm that the Doctor returns to BBC One on Saturday, 1st September with the incredible, Asylum of the Daleks. But you won’t have to wait until then for new Doctor Who as Pond Life premieres online on Monday, 27th August.


Matt Smith returns as the Doctor and called Asylum of the Daleks ‘a cracker’, adding, ‘Steven [Moffat] has written an absolute belter and we have made the Daleks scary again’. But before that, we have Pond Life to look forward to!


Featuring the Doctor, Amy and Rory, this five-part mini-adventure premieres on this site at noon on Monday with parts 2-5 stripped daily across the week. Written by Chris Chibnall and directed by Saul Metzstein, the omnibus version of Pond Life will be shown on the BBC’s Red Button on Saturday, 1st September.


Chris Chibnall commented, ‘Pond Life provides us with a lovely opportunity to catch-up with Amy and Rory since we saw them at the end of the last series.  It opens with the Ponds at home and gives us an insight in to just what happens when the Doctor drops in and out of their lives.  Travelling with the Doctor is one of the greatest things you can do, but it's fun to spend a few moments looking at the chaos he can also bring.’

Caroline Skinner, Executive Producer, said ‘Chris has written a beautiful, heartfelt and wickedly funny piece about the adventures the Ponds have been having with the Doctor since we last saw them on-screen.  It's not long till the series itself will be back with a vengeance - but in the meantime, Pond Life is a truly heart-warming piece about our best-loved companions and their madcap relationship with their raggedy Doctor.’",0,1345649831,null,0,false,0,c5x1xmt,t3_yn2l9,t1_c5x1xmt,t3_yn2l9,null,1429706244,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

But rape with a knife against your throat in a darkened alley, is a very different thing to rape in a bed with a girl who you just consensually had sex with. At least in the publics mind. And one of those is going to make you look like a helluva lot worse person than the other.

The problem, as with all things is the wording. yes rape means having sex without someones consent. But thats not what most people think about it. Most people think rape is violent and involves a girl screaming out no. Now that may not be the true definition, but if you throw the word rape around, thats what people are going to associate with you. Not ""He was 18, and she was 17 so thats why he's accused of rape"" or ""He lied and didnt use a condom so he's a rapist""


Now that, admittedly is a problem with the publics view of rape. However its very useful if youre wanting to make the public hate someone isnt it.

I'll try my best to describe his best attributes for you and where his potential lies. I've only watched him played 3-4 times last season so I'm mostly going on how others rate him, but I was impressed when I saw him play. Here goes...

As expected from any Spanish player you can be assured that he is a very competent passer of the ball. Two years ago he struggled defensively but now I would say he is a definite improvement on Bosingwa. Fans seemed to be disappointed with his inconsistency (common among young players) early on in his career but he started to show some impressive stuff on a consistent basis last season. At his best he is very very good. He has a lot of strength and power and can be a warrior like player. He also has a good cross on him. If he can maintain his current progress he will be worthy of a place in our squad for years to come. His technique is well above the average defender and he's starting to put the rest of the pieces together. Still some work to do but the signs are promising. ATM he will offer us a good attacking option.",0,1345652127,null,0,1345653267,0,c5x2khn,t3_yn0yc,t1_c5x2khn,t1_c5x1xe5,null,1429706547,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"Yesterday I got started on a big ass statistical debunking of Huddlestone myths but for some reason I didn't have the inclination to finish the job. Maybe I'll get back to it at some point.

The TL;DR of it is you're absolutely right. I read all this stupid stuff about Hudd like he's really creative or he's a tempo setter, but in reality his numbers from 2009/2010 are closer to Charlie Adam than they are to Michael Carrick, and it was like a punch in the stomach. 

We are no longer the type of team who gets the ball wide immediately and then spams crosses into Peter Crouch. If Huddlestone could keep it simple more often, he could be world class, but I think there's almost this sense he feels obligated to show off his unfair level of talent. 

He could--based purely on ability--be like Xabi Alonso. His technical ability is THAT good. But mentally I think he's just not the right player for what we do now. People were saying this even under Redknapp.

I do worry that players like Azza will be kind of bummed out losing their best friends. We should never attempt to keep players simply to keep others happy, but Tom and Aaron have been best mates since they were teenagers and I'm sure they're great friends with Daws as well so it's kind of a sad situation.

    Yet herein will I imitate the sun,
    Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
    To smother up his beauty from the world,
    That, when he please again to be himself,
    Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,
    By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
    Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
    If all the year were playing holidays,
    To sport would be as tedious as to work;
    But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,
    And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
    So, when this loose behavior I throw off
    And pay the debt I never promised,
    By how much better than my word I am,
    By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;
    And like bright metal on a sullen ground,
    My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,
    Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
    Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
    I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;
    Redeeming time when men think least I will.

They have to be the main suppliers of attacking width, getting past the player in the inverted winger / inside forward role, and are also the players with whom the most responsibility lies for moving the ball up the pitch quickly when possession is gained.

That's right up Johnson's street, and Enrique too with a bit of coaching, but it's not Kelly's cup of tea at all. His future is in central defence. He could be a good full-back in a team committed to 4-4-2, but not in Rodgers' system (although I expect him to excel as a mobile, footballing centre-back).

So if our response to Enrique being out is to move Johnson over to the left (where he has t stop and turn to receive long passes on his favoured foot) and use a player who is weaker than Johnson on the right, that's two positions compromised by one player's absence.

true,pow-wow,null,null,"I've been working in Liverpool bars and restaurants for years so here are my recommendations.

First off, avoid the touristy Mathew Street area and the tacky Concert Square area. The only thing you can find there is karaoke bars and dance music clubs. A lot of people are recommending The Krazyhouse venue but I don't rate the place at all. It's like the Lidl of nightclubs.

The really happening area in Liverpool right now is the Seel Street, Slater Street and Bold Street area. There are a great collection of new, exciting cocktail bars opening up there recently. For a quiet drink I would recommend Café Tabac, Leaf, Salt Dog Slim's, Aloha, &amp; Santa Chupito's. For bigger 'club' venues in that area look into The Shipping Forecast, La'Go, and Heebie Jeebies (although the latter can be uncomfortably busy on a Saturday night). The clientele in these bars and clubs are no trouble, the prices aren't too outrageous and the music is better than anywhere else on a Saturday night- you'll get plenty of rock and indie but also soul, funk, and hip hop.

Another area to check out if you're staying out later are two bars on Hardman Street (just a short walk away). The Magnet is a small club that has a big indie rock night on Saturdays called 'Liquidation'. You can also check out Bumper across the street which a lot bigger. The music there on a Saturday night is primarily classic Hip Hop with some funk, soul and indie too. These places close at 6am and 5am respectively.

And regarding your breakfast / lunch the next day, you can't really beat Bold Street for food. Café Tabac do great breakfasts and roast dinners on a Sunday. You can also check out The Italian Club or Lucha Libre (Mexican)... there's also a Moroccan restaurant down there but I can't remember the name of it!

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"The North. England is essentially two separate countries (well, you could argue three if no-one claims ownership of the Midlands), North and South. The South is the bit you usually see in the movies: Cor Blimey London, Jolly Good Chaps in the Home Counties, Loveable Bumpkins in the Westcountry, that sort of thing, and there's a lot to be said for it. London is an amazing international city, the south coast is lovely and it does a very good job at the whole Quintessentially British thing.

But that's only half the story. The North is poorer than the South and it has a (not entirely undeserved) reputation for being 'grim' but there's also a great deal to love about it. If you like history, it's fascinating. The North was the cradle of the Industrial Revolution and at one point, the real beating heart of Empire. The big cities like Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool were behemoths in their time and the legacy of all this is all still very visible. There are also areas of amazing beauty (the Dales, the Lakes, the Peaks) and plenty to offer on the partying front.

However, the most fascinating thing (for me at least) is the distinct difference in culture between North and South. People in the North tend to be friendlier and more straight forward than in some parts of the South and communities up there generally seem to be tighter knit. There's also a much stronger sense of collective memory and a feeling that cities are greater than the sum of their parts. Some of it takes a bit of getting used (like the inevitable Yorkshireman who will forcefully insist that his ilk are the most grounded, down-to-earth, call-a-spade-a-spade tribe in existence whilst simultaneously displaying a multitude of baffling eccentricities) but there's also a lot to love.

true,SirMuttley,cnty-uk,British in Bangkok,"Oh dear Simon Jenkins.

&gt; Anyone in England and Wales with a dog out of control can now be jailed for six months.

Reading that you might be mistaken for thinking this hasn't been the law for over 20 years and is only a recent thing.

&gt; But the Defra minister, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, complained in May that fewer than 20 people were in jail for dangerous dog offences. The sentencing council has duly told courts to raise the threshold to two years, ""to send a message"".

The article he links to doesn't suggest Lord Taylor complained to the sentencing council. To say the sentencing council had ""duly"" told the courts to raise the threshold after Taylor complained in May is absurd when they'd already been looking into issuing guidelines the year before.

Also they didn't raise the threshold to two years. The 1991 act makes 2 years the maximum sentence. In fact what they said was that 18 months should be the top of the range sentence when dealing with an owner who's dog injured someone. The 6 months Jenkins mentioned earlier was just the average sentence of those jailed in 2010.

Perhaps Jenkins just hoped no one would bother reading the article he linked to.

&gt; the dispersed rampage dubbed ""urban riots""

Really?

&gt; A month before, a London court jailed a stoned Charlie Gilmour after he swung on a union flag from the Cenotaph and tossed a bin at a police car.... 

Actually the violent disorder charges he faced were for kicking in a shop window and attacking the royal convoy.

However, that depended on his future self *not being inside the box*, and there's no reason his future self would have escaped the box, unless in the past he got his future self to help him escape, which of course his future self couldn't do unless he had previously found a way to escape from the box by *himself*, since the future-self wouldn't exist yet.

First 15, solid. Rest of the first half poor.We were caught out at the back quite a bit, during the bad spell I mean, your man Mcclearly, made mince meat out of us in the first half. Ivanovic appeared very rattled during it. losing the ball and not receiving the pass properly. He woke up though. (along with the rest of the team) I think we need a proper right back in there, (Ivan is a better CB but solid in RB) Hazard. Yep. Quality. OSCAR THOUGH how has he not been mentioned. I thought he was class today. All over the pitch and the whole dynamic changed when he came on. We were miserable beforehand. Nothing was going for us. He had an almost instant impact. Chelsea came alive. Not afraid to shoot and try things. I really really like this guy.Mikel was solid. studge too when he came on. A lot of tracking back. ALSO, the high pressure def in the final 20 mins was great to see. Constantly in their faces and it worked very well. Di Matteo got it right. :D

* Our defensive-understanding needs work. A lot of work. 

    Lamps gave away the ball too many times. Mikel was surprisingly (okay, surprising for me) fantastic. Lamps still isn;t sure whether he wants to join the attack or stay behind and break up play. Either RDM or Lamps - one of them needs to figure that out soon.

* Our offensive link-up needs work. Some work.

    We had the ball in the box too many times and the final pass was more often than not, missing. Ramires shooting instead of passing to Torres. Torres trying to pass instead of score, Hazard passing/crossing to no one in particular, Oscar passing/crossing to no one in particular. 

* Torres needs to stop dilly-dallying and start shooting. Period.

* We NEED a right wing player. Not want. NEED. 

    Most of the Reading attack came down the right wing - the cross to Pogrebnyak, the almost third goal from the free-kick are two moments I recall off the top of my head.

* I have been critical of Hazard on this subreddit and on Twitter but he has made me eat my words. Yeah, I ate crow and I am surprisingly okay with it.

* JT, Cole &amp; Lamps are slow when you compare them to the rest of the team - especially the new ones - and it seems to be hurting the flow of play. Discuss.

* Yes, Torres was offside. It's called karma. Deal with it.

* FACT: Hazard is gonna get roughed up all through the season.

Don't wave £50 notes around - went to Starbucks once and there was this American guy who was obviously flaunting his wealth. Apparently he didn't have any other money left...I'm not saying that you'd do that of course - I have no idea what your financial income is. However, if you are left with a £50 note towards the end of your trip (or more), nip into a shop like Sainsbury's or Tesco's, and ask them if they could give you some smaller notes in exchange for your bigger one. Or you could go to a bank but I'm not sure if that would work :) It's common courtesy. Plus the UK is going through a double-dip recession at the moment, and our economy is shrinking. Just keep money matters on the down low, unless you want to get up the noses of a few people...

Do say please, thank you and make jokes about the weather. Smile a lot too! 

Don't complain about the food. I just did a residential course at a university which gave you a 3 course meal for dinner EVERY SINGLE DAY! Pretty neat right? And all the American students did was bitch about how this was the 3rd day they had chicken/lamb/whatever, or that the vegetables were weird...being a Brit this pissed me off. A lot. If you're given food you don't like just don't eat it, say thank you, (pay), and leave.

In fact just don't compare anything in the UK to how you do it in the US at ALL. We know you're not in the US. You're here to experience something new.

Don't bad-mouth the French, or ask us what we think about the French. This question gets very old very quickly. Same applies to the Welsh and the Scots. Unless someone instigates this conversation avoid bringing it up.

Don't make comments about how young women dress in the evening. Most people who come over are shocked by the way we dress when going out with our friends for a drink (I'm talking about the 18-25 bracket here). I had the delight of one American girl assuring me that all these women will be raped, due to the fact that they were wearing short shorts, tank tops, skimpy dresses, etc. Not only was this damn right rude and hurtful, but it was also hypocritical (she was an NYU student). If you want to enjoy your evening out at a bar, nightclub, etc. just make no comment. Even if you're asked.

Don't expect everybody to speak English. You may be in the UK but there are some cities which have high numbers of immigrants, which isn't a bad thing - quite the contrary! However you must respect the fact that for some English isn't their mother tongue. I myself have had quite a few awkward taxi rides due to this. Don't be afraid to ask them to repeat themselves :) Also if you go to Ireland/Wales/Scotland/Cornwall, some people only speak Gaelic, Welsh or Cornish.

Be wary about taking photos - say if you're in an art gallery or in a busy place (Big Ben?) don't make a 5 foot gap between you and the subject of your photo. But that's just a general tourist thing tbh. 

My real advice is to open your eyes. Don't complain out loud if we do things differently - complaining is an art in the UK. You have to be with the right group of people, i.e. friends, in order to enjoy a nice, long bitch about someone/something/somewhere. Unless you've found a rat in your hotel room, someone treated you poorly in a restaurant, things have gone missing from your room, keep shtum. There will be a lot of challenging experiences for you, but the key differentiation between a charming tourist and a ""dumb American"" is politeness. 

And the most important thing you could possibly do is to enjoy yourself!

I'm not sure where I stand on completely unfettered access to legal suicide but I certainly think that there are situations when it should most definitely be legal. Cases of extreme and unbearable pain or situations where the quality of life is deemed too low for the person to want to continue living. At least I have a lot of sympathy for them and feel that their suffering outweighs any negative impact to society.

&gt;He legally kills himself, it means you agree that suicide is a form or treatment, of therapy.

I don't agree, I think it's simply providing a humane way to die, where some will be pushed to starving themselves or other drastic methods.

I mean, let's be clear about this - at no point has anyone in this thread said that Americans deserved to see the new Doctor Who first.  At all.  What Lereas said was that he wasn't to spend the entire season ducking spoilers because BBC America was a week behind, and so he was going to pirate it if that was going to be their broadcast strategy.

For some reason I cannot possibly comprehend, that just completely set you fucking off.  Because apparently only Europeans should be allowed to pirate shows that are aired on a local delay?

I mean I just fundamentally do not understand your argument on any level.  Is it that you've drawn some imaginary line in the sand for how long a show must be delayed before it's okay to pirate a show?  Like Game of Thrones makes you wait longer than a week so it's not okay to download Doctor Who?

Because it seems to me that his argument is essentially your argument.  Entertainment has become a global medium and people don't want to have to wait to watch something legitimately when the internet makes it possible for them to watch it at the same time as the rest of the world.

Cole couldn't catch up until the Reading winger reached the edge of the box and slowed down to set up the play by which time JT had already covered for Cole.

I am not saying Cole is slow; he's quick, I'll admit that. However, I'm saying he *feels* slow compared to all the young 'uns.

Unfortunately, Galloway precedes with a tremendous echo of just that sort. I am also not a great fan of Assange and like Galloway, I don't at all find the behaviour that Assange is accused of at all tasteful. I'm even a person who believes that one can rape by deception, even if it might be a far lesser form of rape and even though I sometimes dislike calling that because it undervalues rape. However, I do agree with his argument.

It isn't rape as we would normally conceive it. And if it is by some simplistic argument then it is amongst the most minor forms of rape. ""It's rape Jim but not as we know it.""... Barely rape I would say. Like how armed robbery or mugging might both be theft but not in the same way as shop lifting, pick pocketing or stealing a towel from a hotel. Petty rape. To me it's very ambiguous because although she may have been asleep or half asleep, there is no reason to believe that she wouldn't have consented to sex with him and not only that but when she woke up she appears to have consented and gone along with it. While the non-presence of a condom is certainly a justification to cry foul, it is entirely uncertain whether or not it is enough to cry rape.

I think what you fail to understand is that Galloway isn't talking about what might technically be rape but what is actually rape. I loath people who must trawl a dictionary of one kind of another in a desperate search to force labels to apply rather than actually use their own wisdom and understanding to put the accusations into context (it shows that they have none). Especially when they do so poorly. While having sleep sex with someone is certainly walking on thin ice, it is not rape by default. I don't know of any law on rape that defines sleep sex as rape by default. Instead they tend to list it as an example of obtaining sex when there would otherwise be no reasonable expectation of consent.

There has been a sad pattern in modern society of bubble dwelling liberals imposing themselves on everything. Once upon a time if someone was a rapist or a racist and so on it really meant something. These terms have been devalued by misuse (specifically over use). Typically be people trying to make other people look worse then they really are for their own purposes.

You might wonder why Anna Ardin's claims aren't here. That's because her own testimony nullifies the most severe of her own accusations. Don't get me wrong, she was definitely raped.

true,SirMuttley,cnty-uk,British in Bangkok,"&gt; While having sleep sex with someone is certainly walking on thin ice, it is not rape by default. I don't know of any law on rape that defines sleep sex as rape by default. Instead they tend to list it as an example of obtaining sex when there would otherwise be no reasonable expectation of consent.

You keep talking about sleep sex, but I think perhaps you should read what he's accused of:

&gt; 4 . Rape

&gt; On 17 August 2010, in the home of the injured party [SW] in Enkoping, Assange deliberately consummated sexual intercourse with her by improperly exploiting that she, due to sleep was in a helpless state.

&gt; It is an aggravating circumstance that Assange who was aware that it was the expressed wish of the injured party and a prerequisite of sexual intercourse that a condom be used, still consummated unprotected sexual intercourse with her. The sexual act was designed to violate the injured party’s sexual integrity.

So he's accused of having sex without condom with a woman, whilst she was sleeping, who had originally only consented to protected sex. If this is true then he had sex with a woman who had not consented to it.

Do you still think that this is a ""minor"" form of rape?

As for the magistrate court's view of this:

&gt; The position with offence 4 is different. This is an allegation of rape. The framework list is ticked for rape. The defence accepts that normally the ticking of a framework list offence box on an EAW would require very little analysis by the court. However they then developed a sophisticated argument that the conduct alleged here would not amount to rape in most European countries. However, what is alleged here is that Mr Assange “deliberately consummated sexual intercourse with her by improperly exploiting that she, due to sleep, was in a helpless state”. In this country that would amount to rape.

Of course proving the charges are a different matter; however, that is not up to the court in the UK, but in Sweden where Assange should go and face the allegations.",0,1345675645,null,0,false,0,c5x99o7,t3_ymprl,t1_c5x99o7,t1_c5x8s2p,null,1429709786,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The thing is, this is a cyclic occurrence - every time there's a break in the seasons, this place is flooded with memes, pics, jokes, look-what-I dids, look-what-I-founds, look-what-I-mades, look-what-I-boughts, and other assorted what-have-yous. It's because people are bored, and just want to stay in touch with their community fellows, no more, no less.

Instead of limiting and prohibiting content (which only serves to alienate and drive away otherwise enthusiastic members and results in hurt feelings), I've found that the best thing to do is to just grin and bear it, and simply ignore the ""filler"" content, knowing it will end soon enough.

I mean, let's face it - there's no way to please everyone, so unless it's outright spam, it should just be left alone for the users to downvote and move on if they don't like it. That's how Reddit works, and is why it's such a successful site - user-generated content subject to the approval of the community as a whole. This is what it is, and is how it should be - it's Reddit, and that's why we love it! =D

Suicide being illegal isn't stopping people from killing themselves, it just makes it secretive, guilty, and undignified for the suicidal, and more heart-wrenching for their loved ones.

Besides that, my existence, it seems to me, is fundamentally *mine*. It is not the state's-or anyone else's- place to tell me I MUST exist. That makes no sense- on what authority? For what purpose? 
I just happen to be. One as yet unknown day I won't be, and if I decide to bring that date forward, whose business is it but my own? I would just prefer to be able to do it peacefully and in consultation with my family and friends, not hanging from twine in the garage next to a scrawled apology.

Eat with your knife and fork.  Wait until all the people you are dining with have received their food before you start eating yours.  I'm not suggesting Americans have bad table manners, but they are certainly different.  Also, if someone (not a restaurant) cooks for you, don't leave any.  It's rude.  As a nation, we don't like wasting food (although this is dying out).  I believe it stems from the war and rationing.

You can't really spend £50 notes.  Get them changed.  Not all places will accept them and nobody likes them.

Please and thank you are very very important.

""All right?"" as a slight question is more a way of saying hello than asking ""how are you"", but it can be used as both.  It can even be used as an answer to ""all right?"".

I'd have to say that  what I took from most people in my particular area is that N.I(the whole of Ireland in fact) was  part of the UK where they had funny accents. Crude, I know. However, you would meet people of Irish descent, again mainly southern, who would see N.I as some sort of foreboding separate 'other' place.  Where little was known, that you were going to be hated and everyone was angry.  Ive actually had an easier time (give  one or two situations) where I have found  people of the north to be friendlier than those of the south, Just like in Britain. 

The English/British people would not know so much except for conflict and angry shouting.. Oh and Jimmy Nesbitt.  But again I have once heard a guy, who's mother is from Meath! Think that Colin Murray was Scottish.

EDIT:   Education in Ireland's history was minimal at best,  just two pages on the the 19th century, war, and then a bit of troubles.   History for me in School was  Normans, Tudors, the Industrial Revolution and the Second World War.  Ireland was not really studied where I was and thats good reason.

I have an American friend and this was *constantly* happening to him. Obama has thawed the special relationship now though. Even so, a Centrist Brit would be considered an extremely liberal American, so unless you're of that persuasion then it's often best to avoid talking politics.


The only thing I'd say is worth mentioning is about service and eating out. Generally speaking you guys can be very vocal if things aren't to your liking in a Restaurant etc. Us Brits don't really express ourselves that way, and can find it a bit embarrassing if people send things back repeatedly or make a big fuss over things.

I'd say Torchwood, but Miracle Day makes it clear that there is no U.S. Torchwood and never has been. In fact there had been no cooperation between the American government and Torchwood until those events.

I would say UNIT, but UNIT has never been known to keep alien technology for it's own purposes *or* loan out alien technology to other countries. (I also bet that the ""what are using it for?"" discussion would arise, followed swiftly with a ""but he's our scientist"").

true,mattfromseattle,tardis,TARDIS,"I think I related to her a bit. She's 19 and initially gets caught up in the excitement of adventure. She's so naive, she packs a hiking pack with gear, which to me showed that she had no real concept of what she was actually getting into. She left behind her mom and boyfriend to run off with a basic stranger, because of the thrill of it. 

Once they're underway, the novelty of things begins to wear a bit and she realizes just what she's gotten herself into. Despite having the opportunities to return to a normal life though, she remains quite headstrong and stays the course because she made the choice to and the more that people try to push her to return, the more steadfast she becomes.

Towards the end, she's matured quite a bit and I felt that there seemed to be the realization that she couldn't do this forever, and not just because she's human, but because it's taxing, despite the constant thrills and new experiences. But by the time she's realized all this, it's too late and she is basically unable to return to a normal life. But by this point, she's matured and accepted things and is therefore able to do her part ""for the cause"" as it were. I think if you'd have taken Rose on day one and put her into the final situation that her life lead to, you'd have a very different reaction from her than she had as the mature Rose.

I guess I saw a lot of myself at 19 in the character and looking at myself now at 34, I could see and appreciate the development. Or I give way too much credit to the storylines and acting. :)

true,ChestyHammertime,troughton,Troughton,"I've only watched Doctors 1-4 (well, some of 4) so far, but here are my picks from those:

The Aztecs - Even though you've seen some of Hartnell already, this serves as a great summary for the first companions, particularly Ian and Barbara.

The Romans - This is, for me, the First Doctor at his very best, and begins the Who trend of blending humor and drama.  It also features Vicki, whose relationship with the Doctor is nice.  

Tomb of the Cybermen - Fantastic story for 2, Jamie (the only significant companion of 2's era), and the Cybermen.

Inferno - Of what I've seen thus far, one of Who's greatest moments.  Liz Shaw, very different from most companions, is a breath of fresh air, and the serious nature of the story perfectly syncs with Pertwee's portrayal of the Doctor.

Terror of the Autons - This story alone defines the Pertwee era.  Classic UNIT story, introductions of the Master and Jo Grant (3's key companion), cheesy effects.  This serial has it all, and it's a blast.

The Ark in Space - Tom Baker's speech is a classic moment that explores the Doctor's love of humans.  Great episode for Baker overall, as well as for Sarah Jane and Harry.

Genesis of the Daleks - From what I've seen of the classic series, and the new series as well, this is a contender for the greatest DW story ever.  Tom Baker is fantastic, Davros is introduced as a truly fascinating and terrifying villain, and the Daleks are, for the first time, scary.

Those are the ones I recommend.  Sorry if I got a bit long-winded :D

&gt; St. Maria, Virgin, Drive away Putin,
Drive away! Drive away Putin!

&gt; Black robe, golden epaulettes,
All parishioners are crawling and bowing,
The ghost of freedom is in heaven,
Gay pride sent to Siberia in chains,

&gt; The head of the KGB is their chief saint,
Leads protesters to prison under escort,
In order not to offend the Holy,
Women have to give birth and to love,

&gt; Holy shit, shit, Lord's shit!
Holy shit, shit, Lord's shit!

&gt; (Chorus)
St. Maria, Virgin, become a feminist,
Become a feminist, Become a feminist,

&gt; Church praises the rotten dictators,
The cross-bearer procession of black limousines,
In school you are going to meet with a teacher-preacher,
Go to class - bring him money!

&gt; Patriarch Gundyaev believes in Putin,
Bitch, you better believed in God,
Belt of the Virgin is no substitute for mass-meetings,
In protest of our Ever-Virgin Mary!

&gt; (Chorus)
St. Maria, Virgin, Drive away Putin,
Drive away! Drive away Putin!

true,michael_ellis_day,null,null,"This is so awesome!  I'm jealous.  My advice is going to be contrarian because that's how I roll!

Any time I've met someone famous, I've had the best results from talking with that person about something other than the thing he or she is known for. 

When I met Colin Baker, I'd read some columns he wrote for his local newspaper, so I was able to tell him how much I liked them, ask him about a couple of things he'd mentioned in them.  When I met the stunningly gorgeous and wonderful Mary Tamm, I found out it was her first time visiting my city (because I asked) and we got into a long talk about her impressions of it, what other cities it reminded her of, and so on.  I didn't hide that I was an absolute raving fan, but I wanted them to think well of American fans and see we're interested in them as people, and don't just see them as a component in a tv show.  I hope it worked; all I know is, I thought it went well and I treasure those memories.  Quite possibly each of them went away and complained to their agent ""You wouldn't believe the freak I had to put up with for half an hour today!"" but I'll never know.  

So my advice is: enthuse to him about his Doctor, definitely, let him know you're a real fan, but ask him questions about other stuff.  I'd love to know about his act with Ken Campbell that involved putting a fork up his nose.  He used to perform as a comedy duo with Bob Hoskins, and he was in King Lear with Ian McKellen, there's got to be some interesting anecdotes there?  Or stuff about America, like did he want to come here and go all Hollywood or is he happier doing better quality work elsewhere?  The specific questions aren't really the point, just give him things other than DW that he might enjoy questions about.  Seeing as he's a family friend I guess it doesn't need to be like an interview…  ;-D

(Just as a P.S.: when I meet writers, *that's* usually when I haul out the questions about ""why did you do this?"" and ""what was going on there?"" because they tend to enjoy talking about the thinking behind their work and don't get asked as often.)",0,1345691188,null,0,false,0,c5xd2ye,t3_ynqh4,t1_c5xd2ye,t3_ynqh4,null,1429711649,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

true,Samson_Uppercut,num26,,"Somewhat similar situation with Bassong. He's 26. He wants to play. He was probably the **6th** choice CB (behind YK, JV, WG, MD, SC). He did a great job for us in the year we qualified for CL, but he hasn't done much since. And like stated above, in light of the ongoing Modric situation, I think Levy is wary of being labeled as a club that doesn't let players go unless we get every penny we want for them. Selling Bassong and Dawson helps alleviate that. Also, I've seen people complaining that they'd preferred to see Gallas go. The major difference between Dawson and Gallas? You're not going to get anything in the transfer market for a 35yo Gallas. Dawson, at 28, still has a few more years in his prime, he's going to command a MUCH higher fee than Gallas would. And remember, we're talking a player, who for us, was going to be a backup. He's loyal, he plays his heart out, but he was still going to be a backup.

true,IcorrectUSspelling,northumberland,Northumberland,"I worked in PAYG retentions for the past 12 months, and plenty of people wanted to leave for that GiffGaff offer. The best way to get discounts from a SIM only or full contract, is to have an Orange PAYG sim which you've topped up at least once in 6 months.

Usually we could do 300mins, Unlimited texts and 1GB of data for the same price on a 30 day contract. Occasionally we could reduce it by an extra £2.50 per month, but it largely depends on how you used the PAYG sim (less is better if you want discounts). If you speak to the retentions team and say the only reason you won't sign up with Orange is due to a lack of Unlimited data, there's a 50% chance of a manager offering it to you at no extra cost. That mainly depends on how good a mood they're in (I know every manager on that department, and most are bi-polar ;)).

On a 12 month SIM only we could do 600 mins, unlimited texts and 3 GB data for £10. The only stumbling block being the 12 month agreement.

Personally I have an iPad which I got free (pay 10 quid per month for data). My phone is an HTC Sensation XE which I pay £12.50 per month for and get 2000 minutes, unlimited texts and unlimited data as part of an 18 month contract.

true,IcorrectUSspelling,northumberland,Northumberland,"If I still worked there I'd give you my extension number! You're perfectly positioned to get a good deal. If you call up, ask to speak to PAYG retentions (the whole department is based in Newcastle, so there's no mistaking them) and they can help you. You can pretty much tailor your plan, within reason anyway.

 If you sign up for 12 months, you're usually entitled to half price line rental for the length of the contract plus double standard minutes and double data. So you could be looking at £7.50 per month for 12 months and getting 600 mins, unlimited texts and 2-3GB data. 

On a one month plan you're looking at £5 per month off any tariff and double the data allowance. So for £10 you'd get 300 mins, unlimited texts and 1GB data. 

They're just the standard discounts you should be entitled to. The best tip I can give you is to call up and say that you're not happy with the service/price/plan and concentrate on the bit you want more of. So if you need extra data, tell them you're not happy with the data allowance and that companies such as 3 offer better value for the same price etc. 9 times out of 10, unless you speak to a complete numpty, they can better almost any deal on the market.

If you decided to go for a handset as part of a contract the discounts vary largely based on the handset you want and the price you have in mind. Only advice I can give is to NEVER agree to a 24 month contract, as you get shafted by every network on price. 18 month contracts are still available, you just have to ask for them. You're usually entitled to between £5-£15 per month discount, as well as double minutes, double data and extras such as MMS for free. 

TL;DR - Always speak to retentions, bet it Pay as you go or Pay monthly, and just ask questions and you'll find you're entitled to at least 50% more than the average customer!",0,1345695086,null,0,false,0,c5xe2uj,t3_ym92i,t1_c5xe2uj,t1_c5x7gx8,null,1429712122,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Though the only innocence I see is from that particular expression on Eccleston's face, as if it comes from the character within the actor, but not the character himself?

There was a small line about it in 6pt text on the last page of the manual, like they were ashamed of what they'd done.

I found very little information about it online, but the general gist from forums was that, although it was ostensibly a move to combat piracy, it was actually a cynical move to drive hardware sales.  In the US alone, there are apparently 5 million HDTVs with only analogue ports - all of which would need to be replaced by new HDMI TVs to play Blu-Ray.

Faced with junking a perfectly good projector, or sending back the Blu-Ray and giving the industry two fingers, the choice was surprisingly guilt free...

true,absolutedestiny,null,null,"Some things that I haven't seen mentioned yet largely involving something you'll do a lot - eat out:

Don't be picky in restaurants. The service industry in the UK is nothing like the US - what's on the menu is what you'll get on your plate (though asking for something to be without X is fine). We don't do the ""I'll have X on the side and my eggs over medium"" thing at all. In fact, the only time you'll be asked how you want something prepared will be either to determine the kinda of eggs (scrambled, fried or poached) or the cookedness of a steak. In fact, don't go expecting to get food the way you'd expect. It's going to be different, so enjoy the differences. We probably don't know what the dressing you want is, particularly if it's ranch.

Oh and avoid American or Mexican food in general, it's just not going to compare favourably unless you are superbly lucky. Gourmet burgers are a thing but they can really vary in quality so [seek a good one](http://youngandfoodish.com/london/top-10-burgers-in-london/) if you have cravings. Do go to a curry place, we have some of the best in the world. Middle eastern food can also be of high quality and authenticity. Out italian food is likely to be different as we have more a northern italy influence than the US. Eggplant and zuccini are aubergines and courgettes. For British dining, find a place that does a good sunday roast dinner, those will often be independent pubs. Ask around, locals will usually know.

Don't call crisps chips, even though sometimes you will see chips labelled on packaging. It's not that we don't know you call them chips, it's that it's dissonant and confusing. Fries are fine but chips are always steak fries, so call them chips. We like our carbs - we also like our carbs with more carbs, just go with it. When we put cheese on fries, it's rarely american cheese unless it's an american restaurant. Our corned beef is not your corned beef, you want salt beef but that's rare.

Lemonade is rarely what you'd expect, it's usually a soda like Sprite but without the lime. You can get other kinds of lemonade but if you ask for it in a pub or a restaurant you will not get what you'd expect. Expect the Coke to taste different... and the Fanta to taste better :P Few places will offer free refills (notable exceptions are Nandos and Pizza Hut, the former is bearable for a chain if you like chicken), so soft drinks will cost you more. All restaurants are obliged to provide free tap water so ask for it.

Embrace the difference in our breakfasts and remember that our baked beans are not your baked beans. Yes, the bacon is supposed to look like that. Black pudding is blood sausage and it's polarising - try it.

If you're a coffee drinker you'll probably be a bit disappointed. For quantity choose Costa, for familiarity choose Starbucks for quality find a french or turkish/lebanese place.",0,1345712995,null,0,false,0,c5xh6vp,t3_ynohy,t1_c5xh6vp,t3_ynohy,null,1429713596,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Rodgers successfully implemented a passing and control mentality into a moderately good championship level team, and then took them halfway up the PL.

I agree that not all players can be adapted to passing football, but I disagree that Lucas, Downing, and Johnson cannot. Johnson likes to get forward and overlap, Downing actually creates a great many chances - he just suffered because of very poor finishing (more than Walcott, who got 8 assists), and a very good DM is necessary to protect 2 CBs (since the full backs are meant to get forward).

We suffered at WBA largely because Shane Long was excellent and because of two soft penalties, a wonder goal, and a red card - we were unlucky.

true,Stats_monkey,null,null,"A few reasons I think. Firstly, there is the issue of brands. Beer is very much a brand driven market, and brands prioritise consistency so that they can really compete. The whole point of buying a brand is that you know what you get. Wine is not sold by brand, so there is no limit on how bad red or white wine can get, people will still go for house, because lets face it, almost nobody knows anything about wine. How can you, when there are thousands and thousands of different types?

secondly, wines are something of a pyramid product, and a steep one at that! Every bottle of decent wine stands on the shoulders of 1000 bottles of acidic  crap. This makes the crap very cheap, sometimes less than production cost in a bumper year (the more grapes, the cheaper the wine). Pubs can't resist buying super cheap wine, knowing that a good percentage of it will be used in mixers, and of the rest, about half will be ordered by people who know nothing about wine.

Thirdly, once people are in the pub, then the drinks are all competing against themselves. It is the incentive of the owner to push towards the higher profit margin drinks, but for wine to compete, it would have to be as nice to drink as beer, spirits ect. However, the pyramid nature of the wine market makes the more drinkable (nice) wine too expensive to compete with beer on price, so instead the owner effectively removes the drink from competition, because who would order that crap twice? This pushes sales towards the higher margin products such as beer and spirits. ",0,1345717246,null,0,false,0,c5xhlvv,t3_yorpu,t1_c5xhlvv,t3_yorpu,null,1429713782,22,false,UKFrugal,t5_2u4mi,22

true,maskapony,english,Birmingham,"It's an interesting question, I disagree that the only way is down, there's a number of different pressures that are stabilising prices at the moment and probably will into the near future:

1. Low interest rates mean a continual flow of money into the property sector since it's an almost guaranteed way of treading inflation over the long term. At the moment if you want to invest long term property is significantly more attractive than cash or bonds.

2. Dual income households. The old ceilings of 4x Salary for a single wage earner are disapearing across many sectors of British society, a working couple has greater purchasing power today that a more traditional family of the past. In fact once the banks start being more confident with lending then we can expect the ratio to increase in the direction of 4x combined salaries. As the number of these households increase, then in theory so do the average house prices.

3. Good old supply and demand. Unusually compared to much of Europe there is still a big demand for people in the UK to own their own home. This means they are prepared to pay more to get on the ladder, and this coupled with the reducing supply of housing stock (ie we're not building enough to keep up with population growth) means prices getting pushed up.

So expect investment money to keep the market even over the next year or so, then once the economy starts improving it's more than likely that prices will track slightly above earnings because of the demand economics.",0,1345718015,null,0,false,0,c5xhol5,t3_yosdm,t1_c5xhol5,t3_yosdm,null,1429713817,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I also might suggest, controversially, if we get another CM that Gerrard could play on the right of the front three.
