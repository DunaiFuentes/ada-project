And to be honest I have to disagree. The judges in Strasbourg are for all intents and purposes equal to the senior judges of the British judicial system. It may make a difference in the mind of the Daily Mail reader, but I'm sure you can see that the distinction is the result of misunderstanding and a nationalist perspective. All judges play precisely the same role, interpreting and applying the law as objectively as possible. In this case, British law, not European law.

So, continue to object, but please point out specifically what has gone wrong here. Parliament passes legislation, government ignores it, government is called out by the judiciary. Where lies the problem?

Edit: To clarify, if the public is in overwhelming disagreement with this, it is the government's responsibility to deal with that by either amending or repealing the HRA.

You may read that question and have a kneejerk response of ""Yes it is, though"" and ignore the rest of the argument, but I don't think that makes you right.

Prisoners break the law, they got sent to prison, eventually they'll come out of prison. Removing their rights and dignities, locking them out of society for a arbitrary number of years, what does it solve? If they exist in a vacuum they won't change, they'll come out the same as they went in. 

Only by challenging their beliefs, the beliefs that sent them into crime, can you hope to reform them. Sure, in the short term this is more costly, and breaks away from the emotional response of an eye for an eye, but in the long term I think this is the best way of dealing with them. Treating them as humans, and that they belong, instead of shunning them for people with no hope and no possible input.

What could've been a really cool setup would be to have Nine meet Professor Yana (Derek Jacobi). I think the Jacobi Master would've been a formidable match for Nine.

^That explains it all to be honest. 

We have competed in the Champions league with better squads and lost because of 'luck'. This year we were counted out as being just a crap team. 

When we lost to Napoli these people started laughing at Chelsea and English football that this was the end of the era. So Chelsea pulls off a miracle and gets through. 

Reaction : Chelsea got lucky.

We come off against Benfica who were supposed to be the killer of the English team this season. Now these people started laughing at Chelsea not making past Benfica. Chelsea makes it past Benfica.

Reaction : Got lucky..lol lets see them lose to Barcelona.

Barcelona comes and we pull off one of the best underdog stories. We get our revenge and make sure Barca knows how we are one team who will never bend over for them. Chelsea goes through.

Reaction : Chelsea got lucky, Bayern is too strong.

Then the final happens and after going through everything at Moscow we still manage to beat the Germans at their own game, in their own country, at their own stadium. 

Reaction : WOW CHELSEA GOT SO LUCKY! Bayern WERE SOOO OFF FORM!

These idiots do not realize that defending is an art. Bayern did not miss their chances. Against other teams they would have scored. It was Gary Cahill diving in the way of shots, Ashley Cole covering every single easy angle to goal and David Luiz fighting for every header which turned those easy opportunities and shots on goals to ""misses"". Robben and Ribery both fired shots nearly clearing the stadium walls because they were not seeing a way through. You call that dominating and deserving to win?.

These are the same fans that cry for underdogs. They weep like babies and watch movies like Goal and the Damned United. Yet they fail to realize in their bias when an actual fairytail is happening in front of their eyes. That Chelsea, the hated team. The one which was supposed to fail, the players who had gotten so close but lost. Beat every team in the past that defied them, gathered round for one last hurrah and finally acquired their destiny. 

If this is luck then I do not want to win the trophy any other way. We should have shut everyone up but the bias is too strong. Just remember your love for your club and laugh at these fools. They would give up every little piece of their high horse if they could get a passionate owner like Roman and to adopt our squad to celebrate this trophy. It is just jealousy and nothing else. They laughed at us because we were shit and they try to laugh at us when we are the best.

Marin can play either wing and all of midfield, not just attacking. We already have a couple powerful strikers. What we need are play makers both in the middle and on the wings. Look at all of Munich's missed chances in the final. They didn't come from power, then came from plays being made off the sides. In fact, you could say their power on the shots is what caused them to miss so much. That was the beauty of Drogba, he had power and finesse, something Hulk lacks a good balance of. 

Marin plays in a much tougher league. The EPL isn't much bigger, if even bigger at all, than Bundesliga. He'll fit in well.

Marin cannot play in all of the midfield. He's not suited for anywhere other than in the attacking third of pitch. To play him anywhere deeper would be a gross misuse of his abilities and would us positionally weak. He cannot play central or defensive midfield. With Drogba out leaves us lacking a source of goals. Torres and Sturridge need to pick up the slack but only one will be out on the pitch at a time next year. Lamps is always good a for a handful, Mata and Ramires can score with some regularity but having a secondary scoring threat would be nice and could compliment the team, and make it easier for our CFs to score. It is possible to have too many creative players out on the pitch.

EPL is much bigger than the Bundesliga is terms of physicality. There's always a chance that a small frame like his may not be able to withstand a full season. He already spent much of last season injured. We certainly shouldn't rely on Marin, we need a more talented winger to be in our starting XI (Hazard).

The German Messi was given to him at a much younger age, due to his propensity to dribble at the opposition. That's where the comparison ends, he's nowhere near Messi. Nowhere near the talent level that such a nickname would imply. He is nowhere clear to being as highly rated as he was back in 2008. His stock has fallen quite a lot.

I think AVB would succeed at Liverpool, and I think he wasn't given a fair chance at Chelsea, but at the same time he is going to need to keep an open mind if he comes here. Firstly, he won't be able to get players like Hulk or Mata at first, simply because Liverpool is barely a Europa league team currently. It is good that he knows the foreign transfer markets very well, but we just don't have the pull right now to bring in top twenty players in the world. So, until then, he will ned a strategy to get us back to the top. He will have to settle with playing majority british players, including guys like Spearing, Henderson, and Kelly, guys that he normally probably would play because they don't fit his style. 

This is why I would prefer Rafa over AVB. Rafa can take a team and do numerous different things with them. He fits his style to the strengths of the team. AVB does the opposite. He sets a style in place and then works to get the players that will fit that style. I don't know of AVB will be capable or willing of managing a traditional Liverpool team.

I must say however that I am not surprised that the UK has low social mobility. It was my impression that unlike the US, the UK has never had high social mobility, and so this is an issue which isn't necessarily more acute now than it was in the past?

I'm not surprised that the Norwegians are pioneering this type of prison; they have a quite different angle on the whole deal over there.  Speaking to some friends who work over there (ex-pat brits) you can be sent to prison for a month for speeding offences, however your ""stretch"" is booked for several months down the road - often people will take a month's unpaid ""holiday"" from work and then nobody mentions it again!

I admit I find myself torn on this issue; I really feel that there must be some sort of gesture to signify that the offender has wronged society and is being punished accordingly (through removal of freedom and franchise).  However, I can see that in some circumstances reducing the emphasis on ""punishment"" has positive effects on rates of re-offending.  As ever, the issue isn't anywhere near as clear-cut as the media and our politicians would like to believe.

The big knock on him is that he is tiny. When you are that small, the only two ways to get around taking a beating from Premier League defenders is to have electric pace (i.e. Walcott, Lennon) or to show great instinct and skill on the ball (i.e. Mata, Silva). I don't think Muniain is capable of either at this point in his career, but he could some day get there. I would worry that he would get torn up by the physicality of the league.

For better or worse, Chelsea is a team who has built their success over the past 10 years on physicality. We already have a tiny playmaker who is the centerpiece of the starting 11, and I don't think we need to be adding too many tiny wingers unless they fulfill one of the categories I listed above or, barring that, are just phenomenal talents like a Hazard or a Lucas or a Neymar.

And Cambridge themselves explain it quite well:

Basically, yes there are a disproportionate number of private school students who get into Cambridge. But that is simply because private schools *provide* more Cambridge applicants. I.e. they encourage more people to apply. Those private schools are usually selective based on academic performance too, so they take smarter students, then give them the best teaching and help. Therefore students get very high marks in exams. That means more chance of getting in.

I don't think surname or school has anything to do with it. The fact that they those students from private schools are applying with 5 A* grades, a ton of extra-curricular activities and well-groomed interview skills does.

And I somehow doubt they say ""oh look, this guy has 5 A* grades and was awesome, but he's from some shitty local comprehensive school. Let's throw his application in the bin.""

true,ax4of9,null,null,"It really depends on the manager coming in. It is more and more likely that Martinez will be coming in, it seems that many people within football are great admirers of his tactical work. The 3-4-3 of his will render some of our players more or less obsolete. 

Cole hasn't played on the wings since Mourinho's time at Chelsea. He hasn't seemed mobile enough to reprise that role, so out he goes. Aquilani might suit the formation better in the centre of the park since distribution is key. Johnson will do great as a wing back in the 3-4-3, but while Enrique will do well when we play a defensive version of the formation, he isn't good enough offensively. Leighton Baines is perfect for the formation, but hell will freeze over before we get him, and definitely not for less than 20m. France is somewhere that has a good tradition of developing very offensive fullbacks that will be well-suited for the 3-4-3, and most players will come cheap. 

Defense is one place where where the formation will benefit us. Unlike most top clubs, who almost collectively have a problem in the centre of defense, we have Carragher, Agger, Skrtel, Coates and Kelly. The two youngsters have been given good playing time this past season, and both will be ready to step up come next year. 

Attacking-wise, the 3-4-3 will do us no harm at all. Suarez is best when starting from out on the flanks. Carroll will have 2 wingers and 2 midfielders to knock the ball down to. Downing will fit in, but we might need someone who is more incisive at cutting in. Strangely, this formation is one which favours Luuk over his brother Siem, who is my preferred de Jong. 

The worst thing about the formation, sad to say, is that it cuts out the box-to-box midfielder, which means that unless he curbs his attacking tendencies and concentrates on distributing the ball, Gerrard will be the biggest casualty. A more defensive minded midfielder will be necessary, and while I maintain that Kevin Strootman will be perfect for us, the importance is in getting someone who does the job well enough. This will likely disappoint those who have been calling for Diame, as he has shown that he is unable to fit within 3-4-3. Mascherano's ability to slot into defense when necessary makes him born for this style, but he is one of a kind and we are unlikely to find someone else like him.

But I doubt he'll *start* us on the 3-4-3; it only worked at Wigan once they brought in Jean Bousejour in the January window. I know we have Glen Johnson, but I think Martinez will probably begin with a 4-3-3 and gradually mould or shape the side. Either way, it's a little bit academic; Martinez himself said, especially about the game at Anfield, that his team transition between 3-4-3 and 4-3-3 within games at times.

Oh, and as for what OP's asking:

- Backup LB since Aurelio's contract expires next month; unless whoever comes in thinks Robinson is ready to be a stand-in

- Possibly another CB; with Carragher's time winding down, we're left with Skrtel, Agger, Coates and Kelly (who also deputises at RB because we know Flanagan certainly isn't ready). The fact that we're in Europe next season means we need a bit more depth. This isn't so much of a priority though, as Carragher's still capable.

- At least one new wide player and striker - Maxi and Kuyt replacements.

- A backup DM - because we know now that Spearing can't play the way Lucas does.

I'd move out Cole, I'd expect Maxi &amp; Kuyt to leave, and Spearing would stay just because he'll be useful for rotation for Europa League. A fit and willing Aquilani has something to offer.

I think the CB position can wait. We have enough strength there for the time being, and I'd rather enforce the right side than the center.

its a great run. he dribbles past a few people and gets a booming shot off and hits the bar. i just feel like this video describes his play this season. good shift with nothing to show for it.

That being said ...

* New manager might be more open to using **Joe Cole** or **Alberto Aquilani.** Not necessarily a bad thing, esp for Aquilani. Cole - who could still be useful - may simply be too expensive relative to what he could bring to Liverpool FC.

* New manger may also be able to use the likes of Maxi and Kuyt more effectively.

* Our defence is fantastic. A great combination of youth and veteran presence and depth. Not a point of concern for an incoming manager, I'd think.

* All the stats about how poor we were about **Lucas** really shocked me. Through much of the season, I refused to believe that the loss of *one* player could hurt us this much. But, apparently, it did. I'm thinking that we need to find a decent replacement in that role.

* Obviously goals have been an issue. I have to think that **Andy Carroll** will improve, **Luis Suarez** will only get better and **Bellamy** will be effective. That being said ... one proven striker (perhaps another veteran like Bellamy) would be nice.

* And next season I have to think that someone like **Stewart Downing** couldn't be any worse than he was this season.

* We have a lot of great young players like **Carroll** and **Suarez** and **Henderson.** I would love to see more ""crafty veterans"" (especially if Kuyt and/or Maxi leave) fill out the squad to provide some degree of leadership, experience and motivation for the younger players.

As a wizard you may have other more advanced tools, but you would not have any more knowledge (except, of course, for how to use those new tools).

Yes, you may die, but I am willing to risk that for the prospect of getting man closer to traversing the stars.

Gomez turning Cahill in the box and Olic's chance come to mind. So really there were 2 or 3 clear goal scoring opportunities that our defense allowed. You could argue with one or two of them maybe, but I think after Gomez turned Cahill, smart money would be on Gomez scoring. Obviously, there was also the penalty.
So I think it's ridiculous to say that our defense was perfect. Don't get me wrong, I think it was incredible. Every player was usually well positioned to block off dangerous avenues of attack, and guys like Ashley snuffed out the danger very well apart from the goal. Even so, there were goal scoring opportunities for Bayern that we didn't have for ourselves.
What I think is the proper way to respond to people is to just remind them that finishing and poise are skills in the game as well. Just because you created more chances doesn't mean you deserved to win. It's a team game, and if your attackers (Gomez/Robben) have stinkers and can't get anything on target, you do not deserve to win.

As far as transfers go, realistically, I don't see too much happening. The main problem this season was that no one expected Lucas to suffer a season ending injury. Spearing was definitely not good enough to be his replacement. As much as it pains me to say, Spearing is not a good enough player for Liverpool. The only reason he had a stay of execution is because he is Scouse.

It's so difficult to speculate on anything until a Director of Football and a new manager are in. So we'll just have to wait until then.

That sounds like a horrendous downgrade to me, and for a club that has no reason to move backwards.

edit to add: Maybe that sounds harsh on Guidetti. He's an exciting prospect for sure, but his success in the free-wheeling Eredivisie doesn't necessarily predict Prem success, especially not this early. He also has some maturing to do—for example, he celebrated a goal this year by removing his shirt when he already had a yellow. That's insanity and if it happened under Mancini I don't think he'd ever select him again.

But more to the point, all of our current forwards are world class, and of the three you mentioned City would be unlikely to get a fair price in the transfer market for any of them. I wouldn't like to see any of them leave and hope the club don't spend money on RVP or Ibrahimovic or Llorente.

Not directly to what you are saying but sort of
&gt;I won't say it was just luck. Some skills are worth crediting.

&gt;I agree he never managed a complete season, but he managed to pick up a team from a bad state and put it to make one of the best years for the club.

&gt;We played defensive all the games, it is very logical to do when the team is not yet gelled in and the morale is so low. And thats what we did, stay back and defend and once you get the perfect counter shoot and finish. You know how Barca and Bayern kept pressuring, keep attacking, the wasted shots tell the tale. On the other hand, we played calmly, as soon as we got any open spot we tried to score.

&gt;You can't just win over the best team of Europe and say its luck.

&gt;What RDM did wasn't lucky or something, he started w/ Bertrand and you can't just experiment unless you are sure for such big games. And mind you, he did well.
&gt;
&gt;AVB had left the club hanging, RDM fixed his mistakes and brought it on track.
&gt;
&gt;No reference here but this is what Guardiola had been doing with Barca, he never did 'excellent' signings he just managed the team Rijkard had build, he held the excellent players together. And you need balls to manage such excellent players when you know if you do one thing wrong it would get messed up. Guardiola was excellent with that, he kept on polishing the club.
&gt;
&gt;Don't get me wrong am not comparing but just an example.

On the one hand, prisoners have (probably) done something against the law and should have their rights removed.  Why should someone who doesn't follow the rules which everybody else follows be allowed to take advantage of that same system?

On the other hand, what if a prisoner was wrongfully convicted? What if, in the future, we have some corrupt(er) government who have started locking people up for new and exotic crimes and curtailing freedoms - voting could be a last stand for some.

The whole problem rests on the politicians - if they make every attempt to block it they're pandering to a certain demographic (the 'law-abiding, upstanding citizens'), if they accept it, they could be accused in the future of pandering to get the prison vote.

I can see a benefit to this though - there are different shades of convicted prisoner.  Murderers, rapists, people like that should probably not be allowed to vote while in prison. People in prison for possessing some weed, maybe that doesn't matter as much in that case.

true,crazylilting,welsh,Wales,"The thing that really pisses me off about these PRP-GMO pundits is that they will point to studies that there is no horizontal transfer of DNA from plants to humans.  So all is safe right???  We can let them go for it....  What a load of shit this is.  Someone pointed me to one of these studies and the peer reviewed articles and i wasted several hours reading through that crap thinking something isn't right about all this.  We know that food directly affects us, surely it isn't just psychological.  So i thought i'd do a little research on the matter.  

What I found is that Monsanto already knows that food directly impacts gene expression in humans and the next generation of GMO's will be using miRNA.  

On Monsanto's website they state:
There is no need to test the safety of DNA introduced into GM crops. DNA (and resulting RNA) is present in almost all foods … DNA is non-toxic and the presence of DNA, in and of itself, presents no hazard … So long as the introduced protein is determined to be safe, food from GM crops determined to be substantially equivalent is not expected to pose any health risks.

But what they don't tell you is that they will be using miRNA that will block what ever traits they want in pests.  How the hell are they going to do that?  Well as it turns out microRNA is responsible for gene expression and survives digestion and is expressed in the body.  Not only that They will be able to design food as medicine to block the expression of desired genes and even use food as a weapon.  Its no wonder governments are pro-GMO...

I no longer believe anything these pro-gmo scientists try to peddle as truth, because they've known this all along and then pretend that it's safe.  They are all either lying or ill trained and not keeping up with the latest cutting edge technology in the field.

My bike which I cherished, a present for one of my birthdays really meant a lot to me, and then it went. The lawnmower was taken, luckily that didn't matter as it didn't work properly anyway...got a better one when we paid the excess on the home insurance xD Many tools and other stuff, about a fortnight before christmas 2010.

However since then, for quite a few weeks I had a camera filming outside my window into the back garden where the shed is, in case anything happened again, going straight to my computer. I couldn't stand windows being opened downstairs and the back door unlocked, I would always go and shut them incase they were to return and decide to come inside. We've got so many possessions passed down through the family, I'm constantly worried that something may happen and we'll lose them all. Engraved silver ink stand/paper weight/silver biscuit barrel/silver cutlery/expensive victorian china/expensive mantle clocks/silver candlesticks/oil paintings and drawings done by a relative which are amazing in quality/etc. I couldn't sleep for awhile either, I would have trouble sleeping and so when awake I was very alert with sounds and worried. For quite awhile I didn't feel safe, couldn't stand the house being on its own with everyone out. Between breaks at college that were more than an hour I would walk home and get some lunch, partly for that but to also make sure everything was alright.

The fear of being burgled again still is quite high for me, more so than it was before the incident but not as bad from what it immediately was. Can't remember how, but I mentioned it to my tutor at sixth form, he said it wasn't a big deal since it was just the shed with bikes and gardening tools taken...he had never had the experience. Sure, it was just a shed but it was still distressing. I mean, first the shed, what if they came back for the house? Managed to look through a window (new extension done, didn't have curtains up) and decided to return?

We keep bikes in the house now, the lawnmower too. Both gates locked up and tried to improve the security of the shed as well (they unscrewed the locks and put them back on when they got in). I don't feel truly safe, day by day I dread that something may happen again and it'll be worse, losing items that are of great sentimental value to me and my family.

""If you can't fit into society, why should you have a say on it?"" sounds like something white power groups would have said to the civil rights movement. Some religious majority could go ahead and say ""Our society is predominantly of this religion, so people with another religion, or no religion at all shouldn't get a say on it."" I know this last part was a slippery slope thing, but logical arguments should withstand being pushed to their extreme... unless by ""logical"" you meant ""common sense"", which should not be made into law.

On top of that, many see the ""right"" to vote as a responsibility, and indeed [some counrties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_voting) make it a duty (not showing up at the polling station, even if it's to stick an empty envelope in, can come with heavy fines). The voting bit is what allows someone who ""doesn't fit in society"" (to take a non-random example that supports my point, the gay community who is still not allowed to get married to people they love) to actually change society so that they can fit better into it.

And finally, the whole ""you commit a crime (and fail to fulfill your responsibilities) therefore you should lose the rights that come with those responsibilities"" sounds like you are considering a prison sentence as a punishment. It has been argued (and again, supported by empirical evidence, see other comments throughout the page, and also this (rather long) [article](http://www.is.wayne.edu/stuarthenry/Effectiveness_of_Punishment.htm)) that punishment does not achieve anything. The main role of a prison sentence should be to re-abilitate the convict to live within certain limits (that should be wider than those imposed by current society, for the reasons highlighted above).

Oh indeed, but it's ignoring the odds you're betting against in the first place that bothers me. If you have an 1-in-18 chance, you really shouldn't be in the game.

&gt;I cant see anyone suffering in anyway at all, especially as a result of someone parenting a child they love.

The moral reason against this (aside from one's desire to have children past a safe age, which is an issue in itself) is that all the children that *are* born with complications create a burden that the parent will not be able to shoulder for the rest of the child's life, and I have issues with that. Having a child that's born with problems is one thing, and it's admirable (but expected) that the parent will care for the child for the remainder of their lifetime - but when the problems the child has are directly attributable to the parent not taking advantage of the fifteen *year* window to have them, and their reluctance to acknowledge this ultimately being the cause, I think that's morally wrong - you're potentially sacrificing your child's quality of life so that you can pretend you're still 25. All the love in the world won't fix that :-(

&gt;As for ""taking sperm at random"" does not really work like that :)

How is the sperm selected? How do they ascertain which one would have, in a normal situation, impregnanted the egg? And that's before we get to IVF often producing mutiple eggs that you then have to kill some of. I'm not anti-abortion either, but when we reach the stage where we're killing lots of things in order to produce one, I don't know why that's seen as acceptable. They're not devices. Cloning is kind of the same - if I could offer a replacement copy of your favourite pet, would you accept? And if I then told you that dozens of your pet would have to die before one survived, would that change your mind?

I'm aware of the studies you mention. There's nothing wrong with depriving rights if people don't live up to their responsibilities. 

I'd also suggest that you go to your local [Magistrates' Court](http://hmctscourtfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/) if you get the time. You will regularly see people who have been sentenced to Suspended Sentences with ancillary orders such as unpaid work, supervision, drug rehab programmes returned to court for breaching their order. For a first breach they will usually get a more onerous order added such as a breach re-engagement module. For subsequent breaches their Suspended Sentence will usually be activated and they'll go to jail. They go to jail because *they* didn't engage with the Probation Service.

How would *you* deal with persistent offenders who consistently fail to meet their obligations to the non-custodial sentences they were sentenced to ? Give them more of the same counselling that they didn't bother turning up to the first time ?

Prison is often the only option left because of the behaviour of the offender and it should definitely be about rehabilitation but it should also punish people who commit crimes against law abiding citizens. There are victims to their crimes who experience suffering, fear and pain. We should always consider the victim too.

I personally see both sides of the argument, the culture difference is huge. over here, we accept the fact that if a criminal was too pull a gun or knife on us in a mugging or home invasion we are ultimately fucked. But we accept this for a much lower chance of this happening in the first place.

Where as in the US they (as I understand it) accept the chance of it happening statistically (as far as I can tell)more  for the trade off of being much more capable of defending themselves should it happen.

both arguments have merit, both arguments can be hotly contested. In both societys innocent people will die. One could argue over here people have and will continue to die ""for the greater good"" because we dont allow citizens to equip themselves for defense of their lives against better armed/large attackers/criminals . And one could argue in the US innocent people die for the ""greater good"" because guns are more freely available. 

It's a very complex  cultural and moral debate, but ultimately pointless as both populations are generally happy.

Because it doesn't *just* happen because of older mothers - but that factor makes the chances of it happening a lot, lot higher. Lung cancer doesn't *just* happen because of smoking, but smoking does come into it.

&gt;That's a dangerous assumption.

Not an assumption - medical fact. Unfortunately. One's reasons for missing the bus doesn't bring the bus back.

&gt;It implies that all women should have a partner by 35 

It doesn't imply. It *dictates*. There's a difference. IVF has it's own issues (that are also ingnored).

&gt;It also implies that they've willfully ommitted to have children.

Their circumstances are irrelevant. If you missed the bus, does the reason for your missing it make any difference?

&gt;Many women will keep being encouraged by doctors to have children while suffering miscarriage after miscarriage, without getting real help to find the root cause until it is too late. 

Having children is a privilege, not a right. Some people will, some people won't. Some people will cheat (IVF, etc.), but you have to accept the risks with that too - and with increasing the age, I don't believe that what is already a large risk should be increased to a larger one. Our next-door neigbours have a five year old grand-daughter that's morbidly obese - we never see the child without chocolate in it's hand; but they've told us that the child's doctor is sending her to a dietician - because, I guess, telling them to stop stuffing the child with chocolate isn't something they want to hear.

&gt;Using your viewpoint, the past 6 years of us struggling to have a child should be written off as us having ""left it too late"" and that we've been selfish while suffering about 5 miscarriages prior to any testing

I never stated anywhere that this covers all cases - this thread has been started by suggestions that raising the age to 42 is a safe option (when doctors have been listing the increasing risk to parents for decades) and encourages parents to 'put it off' a little bit longer. Sure, there will be cases like yours where it's been an uphill battle, but there are many more cases where people just assumed they could leave it.

&gt;It's a hurtful attitude to have to witness. I suspect it may not be your intention, but it's a very sensitive subject for many.

It's not an attitude, it's reality I'm afaid :-( I'm not saying all this from a 'ha-ha you idiots' point of view, more a 'why isn't this sort of thing impressed on people sooner instead of pretending that leaving it *even longer* is an option?'",0,1337762972,null,0,1337765844,0,c4rc4qw,t3_tyzfx,t1_c4rc4qw,t1_c4r0rtc,null,1428982539,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I personally do not know how I would deal with persistent offenders. But the fact that I don't know doesn't mean that we should do whatever's worse to the convicts and see if it works to reduce criminality or repeat offences. Especially when it has been shown not to.

I do know that there are victims to those crimes. I would like to see empirical study supporting the fact that harsh punishments make happier victims. Victims should get support to get their lives back together, if it is empirically shown that some kind of punishment to the offender helps them do just that, I'll get behind it.

If you working to the assumption that by having a child in your 40s is playing at being 25 I suspect you have more hangup about this than the people in there 40s trying to have children. And I still don't believe that having a child in your 40s needs to be a negative thing. People are living longer. In a world where see can screen against downs, I really see this as a non issue.

And finally...

Sperm is not taken at random, there are a number factors they have too meet. And in any sample the best is selected. Now im not 100% sure of what's involved in the selection process but it does happen. They don't just grab the first sperm they find. It is a scientific procedure after all.

As for aborted fetuses....most IVF treatments fail, and its my understanding that when they do they fail early on. This happens all the time in traditional pregnancy's too and most women are unaware of it, the foetus is expelled at menstrual cycle - the woman is often unaware she was even pregnant. Non IVF Couple can have plenty of failed pregnancy's too before they get lucky. And also, plenty of Non IVF couples have children in to their 40s too. Perhaps people in their 40s should be sterilised...after all it would be selfish not to right?

IVF does produce multiple eggs, around 5 as I remember, but so what, they are only eggs. Women who don't get pregnant loose 12 a year after all :)

regarding cloning...I don't know enough about it to comment.

Too many of the real reasons for women needing this treatment at a late age are ignored.  

A bit more background to our case:  
My wife was diagnosed with Hypo-thyroidism about two years after she developed symptoms.  
If you consider the impact that a fairly common problem for women has on their carrying a pregnancy to term, and then factor in the time taken to diagnose and then stabilise, it does not leave much time for them to act.  
This means that for many, many women IVF is their *only* option, and this at a much more advanced age.

I'm not discounting the risks or rate of success at increased age, but  mainly just challenging the common point of view of ""she left it too late"" that seems very common.

To use your example, ""missing a bus"" because another one ran you over through no fault of your own is not really something you set out to have happen.  
Yes, you still end up missing it but finding any assistance when you've done your best is not a nice experience.

true,daveduckman,null,null,"Really interesting read, but I think it's coloured by a bit too much optimism:

1. Assuming that this sort of style which works so well in Portugal well translate well to the Premier League. There aren't many premier league winning sides that have done it with a high defensive line (especially in the way Villas Boas tried). The premier league is filled with big target men strikers, and if you're relying on a high defensive line to keep them out of the box, then you're invariable going to concede a lot on the counter and from crosses.

2. Assuming we're going to buy another midfielders (especially the attacking type) is an absolute pipe dream. We spent big on Adam and Henderson (who I still think will come up in aces in the future), and neither will have any resale value. Add to that Shelvey and a potentially returning Aquilani/Cole and there's just no way we'd clutter up the midfield with more options, especially given more pressing areas of reinforcement. If we sign anyone, it'll be a defensive minded player to play backup to Lucas (over spearing) and allow the attacking options to be more attacking.

3. I completely and utterly disagree that our defense is suited for a high line. Agger - definitely. Johnson - possibly. SKrtel has become a key player this season, but I still think he is far more a edge of the box defender like carragher or ferdinand than he is a high line player. His strengths are in his physicality and his tackling more than being a very intelligent defender who just sees the build up play. That's not to say he can't adapt. Enrique however, is in no way suited to this style. Enrique has plenty of pace, some good ball skills and works hard, but he is not an intelligent striker. INtelligence is a long way off for ENrique, and forcing him to rely on good anticipation and positional sense is a recipe for disaster. I'm also curious about whether Reina truly is suited for a high defensive line - he's certainly got the sweeper keeper mentality but his strengths (other than distribution) are his command of the area (for crosses) and brilliant reflex saves; he's not so good in one on ones and I think playing a high line opens him up to counterattacking teams.

4. As she points out, we're definitely don't have a left wing option who's appropriate. Furthermore, Kuyt (if he sticks around) really doesn't fit into any of these roles well. This is probably a small point, becuase one way or another we're going to need another wide option regardless of what setup we play. Iker Munain and Lucas Moura are pipedreams.

5. I think one of the biggest things about why Porto were so successful was the outstanding individual brilliance of Hulk and Falcao. Having players of that outstanding quality who work so well together take a lot of the creative and goal-scoring pressure off the rest of the team. Allowing mediocre players in other positions to thrive. While Suarez could be a similar option and play well in that position of Hulk, Carroll is not Falcao. Falcao has pace and ball skills that Carroll will never have. If we still had an in-form Torres, this would be a perfect setup for Suarez-Torres. But we don't and we need to play to the strengths of our squad. Carroll, when he has been improving this season, has shown that his aerial command allows him to be a good striker when either partnered up with someone, or with a 4-3-3 type setup where the inside forwards can pick up his tap ons. I don't think this setup allows Carroll to use those skills effectively.",0,1337769113,null,0,false,0,c4rchca,t3_u0p7u,t1_c4rchca,t3_u0p7u,null,1428982727,15,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,15

Not when the downs' child you potentially leave behind after your death has to be paid for in terms of care by everyone else (and that's just Down's). If it was just your health at risk, then it's your responsibility and chance to take. This isn't the same thing.

&gt;So the chances of not having a child with downs are at worst nearly twice as good as your statistic.

Not my statistic - our GP's. And we were given these for both our children, in 2006 and 2008 - and were also listed in the info we were given, so these figures weren't unique to us. You're also ignoring the proviso at the bottom of that BBC page - 'Also note that the risk of conceiving a baby with Down's syndrome is higher than the above figures but many are lost early in the pregnancy through spontaneous miscarriage'. I would suggest confirming the figures with your GP/ consultant instead of going with the webpage that gives you the results you want. 

&gt;If you working to the assumption that by having a child in your 40s is playing at being 25 I suspect you have more hangup about this than the people in there 40s trying to have children. 

No, you just have to look at people's motivations outside of yours. Many people assume (until they look into it) that having a baby at 30 will be no different than at 20, and some still think this by the time they reach their late 30's and have a nasty shock.

&gt;They don't just grab the first sperm they find. It is a scientific procedure after all.

You have to understand that this is a 'best they can do' not a 'perfect equivalent of natural insemination'. The scientific procedure is in the fertilization, not the selection. They actually remove the inactive sperm via chemicals, but this doesn't actually select the best from the ones that are moving - it's far, far cruder from the process that happens naturally. Nobody in the world will be able to tell you which sperm will win - and the worse the quality of sperm is, the more genetic errors you're introducing from the start.

&gt;Non IVF Couple can have plenty of failed pregnancy's too before they get lucky.

Now consider what happens if you get lucky, then unlucky. Hardly anyone ever does.

&gt;And also, plenty of Non IVF couples have children in to their 40s too.

Now we're into 'my grandfather smoked until he was 90'. Ask any GP if it's advisable to bear children after the age of 40 and what the risks are. Note - see how different their language is depending on whether you're asking generally or if you're asking for yourselves.

&gt;Perhaps people in their 40s should be sterilised...after all it would be selfish not to right?

You can't prevent children without sterilisation?

&gt;IVF does produce multiple eggs, around 5 as I remember, but so what, they are only eggs.

Abortion because of an unwanted pregnancy is one thing - having five because you're cheating in order to have children is a different moral issue - one that's much closer to my example, and you don't have to understand the science to see the moral issue in my cloning-your-pet example.

Wigan's 3-4-3 is very limited by personnel on the offensive side. Offensively, 3-4-3 should be played more like how Napoli does it. In our case, Suarez will drop into the centre when needed, using Johnson to provide the width.1 on 1, Suarez can beat anyone, so with Johnson on the right, Carroll hugging the far post and Downing on the left, that allows us to overload their defense. 

Enrique doesn't give us enough on the attack, but defensively he is very sturdy, and he is fast on the run. 

Gerrard will not be able to hold the midfield in a 3-4-3, but as 5uare2 pointed out, he can be played on the right wing. Against opponents with limited width, this allows both wingers to come into the centre and overload again. I would play this against the likes of Arsenal, where the centre of their midfield is a lot stronger than the wings. 

Johnson has a good cross on him. His tendency to cut in can be beneficial at times, and most importantly he is comfortable with the ball. I feel that in England, there is no one more suited as a wing back on the right than Johnson, just like how Baines is probably the best on the left.

&gt; I recently tried to hire for a  technical helpdesk  position (Band E) in London. Not a great job of itself , but a potential stepping stone to better things after a year or so.

&gt; I had 48 applicants. From memory, only 5 were 'native'. And they came well down the list after the first CV scan..poorly written, irrelevant and of low quality.

&gt; I invited 5 to interview. The top guy came from India with a good relevant degree, excellent social skills, some actual experience and a beaming smile. Sadly he chose to go elsewhere.

&gt; A very strong candidate had recently arrived from Lithuania....strong on the technical side but just a little lacking in the social skills.

&gt; In the end I appointed an Australian guy and have not been disappointed in my choice

&gt; Of the top 10, not a single candidate had been educated in UK. Should I have appointed a poor quality candidate because they were British? And so let down all those who have to use the helpdesk...provide them with a tangibly poorer service? Or should I appoint the best available candidate?

&gt; I know which I chose. I was happy to do so and would do so again.

What I'm saying is: in general, our high school students are misled. The way things are portrayed to students is that high school grades will make-or-break your life - a fact which simply isn't true. 

Think about it this way - if you fail your high school exams, what are your options, and how are they different than if you got good grades immediately? Well, the main difference is that it will take an extra year or two before you can go to university - something that makes *zero* difference to your career prospects. The second difference is probably the one that isn't relevant to *most* people - you won't gain entry to places like Cambridge. 

So, what difference does that make? Surprisingly little.

I can actually find the 1/18 statistic anywhere, and it certainty wasn't anywhere near the statistics I was told of when we went though IVF. I can only assume you are wrong, or the statistic of 1/18 is out of date. I would choose to believe the statistics iv read about on the BBC than hearsay. But even if  1/18 is correct, Im still quite happy with that statistic. 

&gt;No, you just have to look at people's motivations outside of yours. Many people assume (until they look into it) that having a baby at 30 will be no different than at 20, and some still think this by the time they reach their late 30's and have a nasty shock.

that's rubbish and I suspect you know it too. No one wakes up one morning on the 40th birthday and decides they want kids...People try for years. In fact I'm pretty sure you wont get IVF unless you are shown to have a problem. 

&gt;You have to understand that this is a 'best they can do' not a 'perfect equivalent of natural insemination'. The scientific procedure is in the fertilization, not the selection. They actually remove the inactive sperm via chemicals, but this doesn't actually select the best from the ones that are moving - it's far, far cruder from the process that happens naturally. Nobody in the world will be able to tell you which sperm will win - and the worse the quality of sperm is, the more genetic errors you're introducing from the start.

So you admit its not ""random"" then :)

&gt; You can't prevent children without sterilisation?

My point being, is you negative attitude towards IVF couples or couples in general. Would you say my father (who was in his 40s when I was born) was selfish in doing so? 

&gt;Abortion because of an unwanted pregnancy is one thing - having five because you're cheating in order to have children is a different moral issue - one that's much closer to my example, and you don't have to understand the science to see the moral issue in my cloning-your-pet example.

This is factual incorrect....If your lucky you get 5 good eggs, but in the UK only 2 can be used at point of treatment. If you are lucky enough to get to fertilisation on both eggs (very unlikely) you have 2 options: have twins, or abort one. You can abort one fertilised egg very early on (something like 3 weeks in) 

You can argue what's morally right or wrong, but I (and most people I expect) are happy with aborting a pregnancy 3 weeks in. And discarding, or storing the remaining eggs is not an issue for me either.

I have the experience to tell you for a fact that you're incorrect in your assertions. Don't worry so much about the name of an institution.  

Having the opportunity to go to university in itself is much more of a win than anything else, top 20 universities don't matter as much as you think. I went to a top university for my subject, and you know who cared about that during my post-grad? Nobody. I'm a few years in to my PhD just now and I have never been asked which institution I attended for my undergraduate. 

Also: I didn't say that A levels don't matter. I said they don't matter as much as you think - which you've shown irrefutably through your overly dramatic reply. Universities are changing, they're realising more and more that the knowledge isn't the important part, it's all about the skill-set. If you want to study physics and get a great job, the best thing you could do is learn how to program, for instance. And finally, my whole point was that high school kids are essentially lied to - they're made to believe that everything rests on this one point in their life - which is bullshit.

I'll say again - ask your GP.

&gt;But even if 1/18 is correct, Im still quite happy with that statistic. 

Which summarises the issue nicely.

&gt;that's rubbish and I suspect you know it too. 

Why, and why? I'm not labelling all older parents into one group, just pointing out that many people are so keen to see older-parenting as an option, they don't realise that delaying comes with it's own risks. You're actually already doing what you're accusing me of - you need to stop assuming everyone else in your position is the same as you.

&gt;So you admit its not ""random"" then :)

Far from it - there *is no way* of selecting the healthiest sperm. At all. You've gone through IVF, and you didn't know this?

&gt;My point being, is you negative attitude towards IVF couples or couples in general. 

Nope. You're taking my comments personally because you're in that group - to the point where you now assert that I'm 'negative to couples in general' - I'm starting to see why you might have trouble digesting unpleasant figures if a suggestion you don't like leads to stupid claims like that, especially when  it ultimately doesn't make any difference to the results. You're using a random sperm to force-impregnate an egg. Sorry if you think that facts count as a negative attitude, but I'm rather be a realist than put on la-la headphones when the bits I don't like come up. Which brings us back to why it's pretty obvious that raising the age will then lead people to think that they can have children safely at 45 instead of 42, just like raising the motorway speed limit by 10mph would mean people driving at 90 instead of 80. Unless, of course, you're incapable of appreciating anyone else's situation outside of yours, or would rather not know in advance of any potential problems your child may have. I'd prefer to know.

&gt;Would you say my father (who was in his 40s when I was born) was selfish in doing so? 

Older fathers have the same risks as older mothers, do they? You're taking it personally (again), which a) *still* changes nothing and b) actually highlights one of the points I made before - people see having children as a right (which it isn't), and if life has treated you unfairly then that'll somehow negate the risks you take having children later on *or* by IVF, which it doesn't. The main concern here is that my fears and the problems I've listed are all in existence *now* - and the idea of increasing the age limit even further would require some sort of advance in medical science to accommodate this, which hasn't happened.

&gt;This is factual incorrect

Only if you're just talking about the UK since the law changed (and are that desperate to attack) - but the moral issue is the same, unless you manage to then have twins. Many people will travel abroad to avoid this limitation anyway, just like the Irish do for abortions - that doesn't mean they don't have different moral considerations.",0,1337774929,null,0,1337776101,0,c4rcz8p,t3_tyzfx,t1_c4rcz8p,t1_c4rcrca,null,1428982977,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

**Torres**: Came along and gave us hope. He was our first world class striker we've had in a long long time, you know the sort that can score from anywhere against any number of opponents, then he left and broke my heart.

Now:

**Suarez**: I love his style of play. Hes liquid, energetic and creative. his first game against united proved that when he danced through their entire defence with a smile on his face. He's reliable as a striker with his never say die attitude and saved us from being a lot futher down on the table single handedly a few times.

(WHOA, CALM GUYS, RELAX!! LET ME EXPLAIN) Yes, he had a TERRIBLE start to the season, he was bought for far too much money and was slow and clueless. The reason I like him so much is because instead of giving up and accepting how things were going he kept coming back and working harder. He took all the shit on the chin, even with everyone mocking and hating on him, he kept his head down and didnt let it get to him. 

Do you have any idea how much it must SUCK to have EVERYONE shit talking you? even your own fans? (lets not deny guys that SOME fans were) All the respect in the world to Kenny for sticking with him, any other manager would of had him wasting away on the bench (*cough*Torres*Cough*) When you watch his last 8 games he's gotten to that stage where he just plays football and doesnt let the mood of the game effect him like it would other players.

why?...iv found more than one statistic that does not tally up to your statistic. If you have proof of your claim lets see it.

&gt; Why, and why?

Simple, you speak in absolutes. I'm not saying there is not an element of truth to the idea, but by and large you assumption that most people who have IVF in there 40s have just thought of the idea of having kids, or have put off having kids is incorrect.

&gt;You're taking my comments personally because you're in that group

which group...40 year olds, or someone who has gone though ivf, or someone who conceived naturally? Apart from not being 40 I fall into the latter two. But im not taking a single comment from you as negative. I simply disagree with them as I see them as flawed, and short-sighted.

The base of your argument is that its too dangerous fto have a child via IVF treatment at 40+. While I agree the risk increases (statistical fact) our opinion on that risk is clearly very different.

If we assume 1/18 is correct (?) then combine it with a very solid/successful test of Downs, then Im happy with those results, and clearly are the people who propose the age be raised....Who I suspect (given that techniques/technology/science is constantly improving) have more knowledge than you or I.

But in addition to this, you seem to have a very low opinion of potential parents, which have no bases in reality. You seem happy to tar all IVF/40 year olds with the same brush, ignoring other factors which for the most part are more important.




&gt; people see having children as a right (which it isn't), and if life has treated you unfairly then that'll somehow negate the risks you take having children later on or by IVF,

Much like flying...people don't actually have the right to fly, but science and technology has makes it possible. Aint that great!

But in all seriousness...People, especially older people don't see having kids as a right, i never regarded children as a right, my friends don't regard children as a right. Deeply disappointing if you cant have them, but as a right, for the most part no.

You are also made fully aware of the risks once you enter the IVF clinic.

You're now asking why a GP's advice might be better than a generic BBC page that has provisos at the end that you've ignored?

&gt;iv found more than one statistic that does not tally up to your statistic

Once again, it isn't my statistic. It's information given out by two consultants and two hospitals. It's the sort of thing you don't forget when it's a large factor in deciding whether you have any more kids.

&gt;If you have proof of your claim lets see it.

Advice given by a GP, Hospital or consultant isn't a claim. But that's why I've been saying 'ask your GP'. If the info has changed, then it has changed - but I'd need to hear it directly from a doctor or consultant, not hunt the internet until I find the figures I want.

&gt;Simple, you speak in absolutes. 

No, that's how you're reading it. Nowhere do I say 'the only people doing this have left it too long because they were lazy or ignorant'. My point is that many people do, and this will make the problem worse (the motorway speed limit analogy).

&gt;but by and large you assumption that most people who have IVF in there 40s have just thought of the idea of having kids, or have put off having kids is incorrect.

Er...I didn't assume or assert that as being the only cause anywhere, either. However, these people are included, to an extent - if you've been trying for long enough that you're into your fourties, it's really too late. And note that we haven't gotten to the seperate issue of having a child at 42 that will be twenty when you're 62.

&gt;Apart from not being 40 I fall into the latter two

So why are you arguing from a position of failing to see any other groups?

&gt;I simply disagree with them as I see them as flawed, and short-sighted.

Fine, you're free to disagree with anything - but you haven't pointed out any flaws; you've just listed groups I wasn't really covering anyway.

&gt;The base of your argument is that its too dangerous fto have a child via IVF treatment at 40+. 

Almost there - the base of my argument is that it's too dangerous to have a child at 40+. IVF and the like bring their own risks to add on top.

&gt;then combine it with a very solid/successful test of Downs, then Im happy with those results

If you're prepared to take those odds as not an issue, I'm not sure where to go. Those odds are presented to *dissaude* people, not encourage them.

&gt;Who I suspect have more knowledge than you or I.

Only when taken out of context. The recommendations listed are for a specific set of people (cancer patients and the like), not the population generally. And they're a bit hollow anyway, considering the local PCT's don't have the money to fund them anyway.

&gt;But in addition to this, you seem to have a very low opinion of potential parents, which have no bases in reality.

You keep making assertions based on things I haven't said, anywhere. Consider that before discussing 'reality', or start quoting more.

&gt;You seem happy to tar all IVF/40 year olds with the same brush

And again. I even said that wasn't the case in the last comment, I think.

&gt; ignoring other factors which for the most part are more important.

Which you're using to paper over important considerations that I've listed that are ignored because of the assumption of one's rights overriding all. It doesn't work like that.

&gt;Much like flying...people don't actually have the right to fly, but science and technology has makes it possible.

So I can go fly wherever I like, without a license or any money? Why not? Where's your compassion? ;-)

&gt;Deeply disappointing if you cant have them, but as a right, for the most part no.

Indeed, and that's why you have to start sooner rather than later to maximise your chances, and more importantly minimize the risk. Sure, there are many people who (for whatever reason) haven't managed it, people who have been seriously ill...but none of those reasons (which could generally be called 'injustice') will change the outcome - and you have to acknowledge that there *are* many, many people that simply didn't think it would be a problem, or that age would be an issue. I mentioned in another post that when you see downs babies when swimming, they almost always have an older mother. Now sure, this is anecdotal evidence, but consitently in the past five *years*? I think the issue of people putting it off is much, much larger than you think - these people don't automatically get NHS IVF, for example, which is why there's such a huge private market for it. Now imagine if these people think they have *another* five years...considering the warnings they give out with the age limit now, I'm not sure why this is being mooted.

Well *that* one is definitely bullshit. Seems to me that the vast majority of things are inefficient and annoying. Go to the post office, enormous queue and only two people on 9 counter positions.

When I was running a business two years ago, the local council were TERRIBLY organised. They lost a huge pile of paperwork we had given them because their internal mail service was down. They were actually giving letters to some builders who were working on both council offices and asking them to carry the post between buildings. Brilliant!

I worked in the NHS for a year too. Staggering inefficiency in most things. In most places, you still can't do modern day things like book an appointment online. They still write and post physical paper letters for appointments in most hospitals.

true,HPB,eng-durham,Durham,"&gt;I personally do not know how I would deal with persistent offenders. But the fact that I don't know doesn't mean that we should do whatever's worse to the convicts and see if it works to reduce criminality or repeat offences. Especially when it has been shown not to.

We aren't doing what's worse, we're doing the only thing left. You *really* need to go and observe what happens in a court and see some of the offenders who pass through the system. I've seen many offenders with 20+ year criminal careers and over 200 offences to their name. They've had every intervention possible several times over and have not bothered to try to engage and change their ways. Prison is the only option left - everything else has been tried.

&gt;I would like to see empirical study supporting the fact that harsh punishments make happier victims.

I didn't mention making victims happy - I said we should consider them. One of the main things that anti-prison advocates forget is that when a persistent offender is inside they *aren't committing crime* in their community. Do you really need an empirical study to know if having a break from burglary, car crime, theft, ASB makes a community happier ?

&gt;Common sense and unsupported opinions have no place in justice.

Your point about common sense is completely wrong. When Magistrates and Judges sentence an offender for a number of offences they are reminded by their Clerks about the Totality Principle. This prevents the offender being subject to a draconian interpretation of the law and being sentenced for each and every offence. Instead, using the Totality Principle, they are sentenced in such a way that the punishment fits the crime.

For example, a shop lifter appears for 10 offences. Instead of being fined 10 x £110 they may be fined £200. This is so that the punishment is not too severe, is proportionate and does not set them up to fail. The Sentencing Guidelines say fine 10 x £110, the Judge or Magistrate says £200. *What is this if NOT the application of Common Sense ?*",0,1337782627,null,0,1337782817,0,c4re2zi,t3_tzbab,t1_c4re2zi,t1_c4rc5m7,null,1428983448,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

A good model to avoid this (doesn't always work) is to pay for the training and take it out of the employees wages - this might sound like it is mean but at least its fair. Say I put you through a course that costs me £1k and gets you a valuable qualification, you get £50 less in your pack packet until it is paid off.

This kind of thing is down to individuals, I don't think there is a lot people could do if you ditched the job and buggered off - (people still get paid for the time they are doing the training).

Employee testing is getting to be a big area now, maybe some components of it can be tailored to gauge risk.

I don't really see that as a solution. Why can't they just put religion aside instead of being forced to change their religion or change jobs?

If older dialect speaking residents of these areas are asked what a 'moggy' is, they will say 'owt smo' an' wick ', i.e. anything small and quick. In the same districts, cheese is often referred to as 'moggy meyght' i.e. 'moggy meat', or in other words, food for mice. Many etymological authorities believe that cats were originally referred to as 'moggy catchers' and the term was abbreviated over time.

&gt; I'm a fan of Amazon, but I'm not going to tell Jeff Bezos how to run his business. Let the pro's do their work and if they have questions, then be ready with some good answers.

The one part of my quote you didn't address was - how do SoS want supporters to be involved on this issue? Do they really want some say in who the new people in the various positions are? Because without any official ownership, we really have very little say in that; and I say rightly so, because the owners have experience, or are surrounded by people with experience, on running sports businesses.

I know, he's comparing a club to a franchise, but in essence our ability to influence things does not extend too far beyond what an Amazon customer's would be to change things at Amazon. If Blackburn this season, us under H&amp;G, and the Norwich-themed Glazer protests at Man United all have one thing in common, its the fact that for the most part, the fans were powerless to really *make* anything significant happen.

Yes, H&amp;G finally bolted, but that was when the banks came a-calling, not when the fans first started booing them - those parasites stuck around for a long time after that.

Liverpool can't exist without fans, and I doubt our new owners would ever let things slide to the point of alienating a large chunk of supporters - I don't think SoS represent more than a paranoid, headless chicken minority on this issue, most fans can sit tight for a week or two and see what FSG come up with - but unless there's a degree of supporter ownership, our power to influence key decisions at the club is diluted to the point where we almost are a franchise.",0,1337794647,null,0,false,0,c4rgotk,t3_tz4b0,t1_c4rgotk,t1_c4rd1wz,null,1428984745,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"**On point 1**: I'm not sure I agree with you on that. The main method used by teams to shred Chelsea's high defensive line under AVB was balls over the top or through balls - see the Arsenal-Chelsea game for example. But more generally, I agree there are doubts about whether the style will necessarily succeed here.

Still, AVB did make two adjustments to his Porto style early on at Chelsea - the DM at Porto would both drop into defence and also get forward when possible to add to the attack. AVB realised this wouldn't work in the PL, particularly because of how quickly teams counterattack. Secondly, he dropped from 'a high block' to 'a medium block'; essentially, a slightly deeper line with a bit less pressing. This might in part be due to Chelsea's squad, but I think it was also, again, better suited to the PL.

**On point 2**: Agreed. We don't need more attacking midfielders, and I think Aquilani would be our best shout to fulfil the 'Moutinho' role, with Adam as a backup (after all, he played a 4-3-3 at Blackpool, designed to hide his defensive weaknesses). We do need a defensive mid.

**On point 3**: disagree on this - I've always thought Skrtel becomes more anxious when he's defending close to the box. When Skrtel &amp; Agger have played together, we've played a higher line, and most of Skrtel's best performances come in partnership with Agger. By contrast, when Skrtel and Carragher are paired together, we drop deeper, and Skrtel also performs worse. Similarly under Hodgson, when we were defending right off the edge of the box, Skrtel played every game that season and hardly covered himself in glory. I think a high line suits him.

Reina's form has dropped off, particularly on one-on-ones, over the last two seasons. Then again, (I'm not 100% sure on this), haven't we been through a couple of goalkeeping coaches? I also remember him saying he was unhappy with the coaching he was receiving when Hodgson was manager - I don't know if this was specific to goalkeeping, or just part of Hodgson's general ability to piss off our best pass-the-ball players.

As for Enrique, I guess we'll have to wait and see. You might be right, although saying he has no intelligence is a bit harsh :P He definitely has room to improve

**On point 4**: Given that Downing will have no re-sale value, I'd give him at least the first half of the season to show whether or not he can play there. Yes, we won't sign either of those two players.

**On point 5**: When I first spoke to the writer when she post this thread at /r/soccer, this was the biggest issue I had. When AVB went to Chelsea, he tried to use Torres for the Falcao role, not Drogba. Given that Andy Carroll is currently a poor man's Drogba, it's a bit optimistic to hope Carroll can play the role. Still, I think Carroll is faster than most people rate him, *when fully fit* - which hasn't been enough this season.

My issue with AVB isn't his Porto success - it's the fact that he seems incapable of deviating from it at all when his squad/opposition don't suit it. ",0,1337795753,null,0,false,0,c4rgy6d,t3_u0p7u,t1_c4rgy6d,t1_c4rchca,null,1428984885,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

But then he got ambitious (greedy?) and started clamoring for 'a more central role' on the pitch. What's worse, in order to prove his 'CF-worthiness', he would dribble down the centre to try and get into a typical CF position and then shoot when a pass would have allowed someone else an easy tap-in.

[What Danny-boy didn't realize was that it was AVB's tactical setup that allowed him to make all those free runs to the edge of the box, or make all those penetrating runs along the flank, and score all those shots with his left foot.](http://www.eplindex.com/14831/andre-villas-boas-succeed-liverpool-failing-chelsea.html/2)

He's played the CM role a lot more this season and he's been a [decent dribbler/passer of the ball](http://www.whoscored.com/Players/1563/), IMO. Nonetheless, I don't see him being too happy on the bench (which is where he is likely to feature for most of the season) and I guess he might soon be on his way out.

McEachran, sadly, doesn't have the fitness, strength or stamina to play a 90 min PL match yet. His first full appearance in the Carling Cup game against Liverpool saw him get injured just before half-time. He needs to bulk up. He needs to get playing time in a side that will play him regularly. He needs to be able to stay on the pitch for the whole 90 minutes. A loan to a Championship club (as opposed to a PL club) will probably help him with all that - just look where it got Bertrand today!

Hazard, I'm not too keen on for a variety of reasons and I've said as much [elsewhere](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/u0buk/papa_roman_spendin_rubles_this_summer/c4rd9i9). Plus, how do you justify giving him 200k a week when we haven't seen him play on a cold thursday night at the Britannia Stadium in Stoke? :-P

Jokes apart, if you pay Hazard 200k a week, do you think Modric (assuming he agrees), Lamps, JT and Cole (and maybe, even Sturridge and Torres) will be okay earning anything less? That's 5\*200k\*52 = 52 million pounds (or 7\*200k\*52 = 72.8 million pounds) per annum on barely 20% (or less than 30%) of the squad! Just to give you a comparison that's quite close to the annual loss we declared this year!!

The shadow of the FFP weighs heavily upon our club. We have declared 67 million pounds of losses this year. We are leaving players on a free rather than selling them. We are negotiating contracts to ensure that our wage bills are as low as possible without pissing any player off. ALL of this is being done to ensure compliance with the FFP. 

At the same time we expect dear Uncle Roman to drop wads of cash on Modric, Hazard, Falcao and Hulk. No one seems to worry about the 120m transfer bill or the 70-odd million wage bill that it will bring. No one seems to realize that failing the FFP will mean disqualification from European competitions.

Also, Johnson likes to attack from the right side, so he would be able to replace Suarez's empty space. 

I think something like this could work. Having a hulk of a striker like Carroll doesn't hurt, when in form, in a 4-3-3 to hold up play and put home headers. I agree we would probably need another LW, but I also think Downing shouldn't be left out to dry yet. The CDM position is tailor fit for Lucas, and maybe with Spearing as a backup. 

I think this shows that AVB's way of football *can* work at Liverpool, but he will also need to make adjustments. For one, Liverpool has played more possession football than Porto. At Porto, players like Hulk, Falcao, or Moutinho can create plays for themselves. Apart from Suarez, our players can't really do that.

that's not good enough. Why should I take you're word (and that all it is) without proof. Iv spoken to my GP, that statistic was never mentioned to me, I think I would have remembered it.

The burden of proof is with you, you're making the claim. Simply saying that what my GP said (when my GP did not, and stats online don't back up up) is no more proof than saying ""my mum said""...

You cannot base your argument on a figure that cannot be backed up


Also, this is an intresting read.

http://www.nhs.uk/news/2011/07July/Pages/ivf-fertility-treatment-downs-syndrome.aspx

&gt; haven't gotten to the seperate issue of having a child at 42 that will be twenty when you're 62.

Non issue for most people. Clearly not for you. But for most its a genuine non issue.

&gt;So why are you arguing from a position of failing to see any other groups?

I would argue I have seen it from every group with the exception of  people on IVF past 40 years who are on IVF as nothing more than an  afterthought  - because I don't believe those people exist on large enough numbers for that argument to hold water (as this seems to be one major basis of your argument). I can of course relate to their situation speaking as someone who has gone though the IVF process, and know more people than most who have also gone though it. 


&gt;If you're prepared to take those odds as not an issue, I'm not sure where to go. Those odds are presented to dissaude people, not encourage them.

They are presented to make sure people understand their situation, to allow people to make an informed choice. 

The nhs I don't believe will pay for treatment if they do not believe there is a good chance of success.

And that's the issue with this disagreement. You think it should not be allowed because of the increased dangers, I think it should (for the most part) because while there are dangers those dangers for some people are within acceptable parameters, even morally they are within acceptable parameters if you are morally okay with the slim chance you might have to terminate (at 2 months i believe) a fetus with Downs. 

If your not okay with the moral issue of abortion at two month i would say that's fine, the argument is over. You can choose not to have IVF.

&gt;So I can go fly wherever I like, without a license or any money? Why not? Where's your compassion? ;-)

Its not about if you can afford it its about pointing out that progressions in science can benefit people. Flying is no more a right than having children, or IVF. But...what was once not possible now it is, that's the point.

&gt;and you have to acknowledge that there are many, many people that simply didn't think it would be a problem, or that age would be an issue. 

I'll admit that most people don't think there could problem. But I am yet to meet a person with the attatude that having a child late in life would be easy or problematic.

In my experience people try for kids late 20s/early 30s. It can take years to realise you have a problem, it took us 7 years before we sought/got help. From there it took a further 2years before we actualy had a child (naturally conceved). That's genuinely very typical. 

Had I left it too late... In hindsight, Yes, I suppose me (jobless) and my then jobless girlfriend could have started trying when we 16/18 years old, younger would have been better. But the problem there is you often don't realise there is a problem untill it's too late. And I don't believe encouraging kids to get busy just incase you/or you other half has a problem is a good idea either :)  Another thing I could have done was simply leave my wife for someone else.


&gt;I mentioned in another post that when you see downs babies when swimming, they almost always have an older mother. Now sure, this is anecdotal evidence

I'm happy to take that at face value (because I can appreciate there's an element of truth there). 


&gt;we are only talking about the UK....Not really

Extending the age in the UK has nothing at all to do with the procedures in other countries. The article, this thread is about the UK. If at some point that changed I never saw it.



I'm glad IVF is available on the nhs, I'm also of the opinion it's not essential, and it is a luxury. But...while it is, and while there are tests in place to test for downs, and while I'm reasonably happy with the statistics iv seen, and I have no problem at all with older parents at a time we are all living longer I see no problem at all with raising the age to 42. 

In an ideal world (and on a personal level) I would be happy to adopt over having my own child naturally or via IVF. But that also not practical unfortunatly.  ",0,1337800216,null,0,1337813824,0,c4ri0ct,t3_tyzfx,t1_c4ri0ct,t1_c4rdtae,null,1428985360,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I've worked in the NHS and they pissed away money in every direction. Too many chains of command that make it impossible to change anything in a timely manner.

And that's one department.. now imagine doing it another department. £18,000 would pay another nurse.

I also know that the secretaries in our department were running on about a 3 week backlog for typing. That's just a massive delay in everything.. not very efficient. And the end result is actually that people wait longer for everything, become slightly more ill and need slightly more treatment for slightly longer, which costs more.

We are at a vulnerable stage in our development, having only survived life in the Premier League by the skin of our teeth and with little help on the final day from Barton. So he must to go.


I was one of the people who booed Barton off the pitch at Loftus road, it was more instinctive than anything else. I'd had enough and hoped he would sort himself out, yet it looks like his issues run too deep, I suspect he's beyond help.


Tevez provoked Barton and like a well-rehearsed script Barton responded on cue.

RE: Hazard - not a hope in hell he'll earn anywhere near £200k a week, despite what he, his representatives or the papers say. It's all conjecture by his agents/representatives to extort as much money as they can, but it'll be wayyyyyyyyy shy of £200k. In fact I'd be surprised if it was as much as £100k - but then that is, obviously, IMHO.

RE: FFP. It's all a bit of a fallacy at the moment. Have a read of [this](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/elj/eslj/issues/volume9/number1/geey/geey.pdf) - it's riddled with loopholes. Essentially clubs will not *have* to 'break even' until 2018-19 at the earliest, despite what the papers have told us to the contrary. On top of that, clubs can effectively appease UEFA by offsetting their losses by sinking an equal amount of cash into their 'youth setup', and a whole host of other areas - community stuff, charity events etc. Basically, it's the age old trick of creative accounting. 

There was an article on the Telegraph website a few weeks ago that went through this with a fine toothed comb, and of the top 10 ranked sides in Europe, only Bayern Munich would currently meet the perceived rigidity of FFP rules. On top of that, there's not a hope in hell that UEFA would have their showpiece tournament without the Barca's, Madrids, United's &amp; Chelsea's of this world competing - simple as that.

I have to say, if that happened I would be utterly humiliated.

It's not what happened though. In your first article, the pharmacist followed the code of ethics to the letter, as she/he was wont to do - even going so far as to give the reason she/he couldn't supply it. In my experience, some pharmacists simply tell the customer they have ""none in stock"" out of fear they will be the subject of articles such as these. Also, to suggest that a pharmacist would infer to a patient that they won't provide a service as they are a ""slag"" is not only delusional, but downright ignorant of the pride we take in our work. From the BBC article:

&gt;""The pharmacist beckoned me to a shielded-off area and said she was not prepared to give me the contraception because it was against her religion.""

Can you think of a more tactful or respectful way to deal with that situation? The patient was taken to a private area in order to preserve her confidentiality, and the pharmacist explained the situation and signposted the patient to where it would be available.

Again, I personally err on your side of the argument - that religion should play no role in the provision of a public service - but to make the suggestion that the supplies are refused on a personal level (""I think you're a slag"") is down right wrong.",0,1337804971,null,0,false,0,c4rj5j8,t3_u0oav,t1_c4rj5j8,t1_c4rivax,null,1428985899,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Euthanasia is a choice some people want to make because the remainder of their life is going to be nothing but misery or pain (usually because of some terminal disease that will slowly kill them anyway). Who are you to tell that person what's best for them? 

Surely that is an agreement? Who are doctors to tell them what is best for them. What is important is it is both appropriate and medically correct. Euthanasia is not comparable, it is a one way decision based on ending suffering, contraception is a decision not to have children at that point in life, it is not a one way decision. Neither does it have the gravity of ending a life. 

&gt;That's their medical choice, not yours. Doctors run into the same issue with people who refuse treatment. Your patient doesn't want a procedure that will save their life? Too bad. It's their choice, not the doctor's. That's the whole point. You are a doctor. You treat people according to their wishes and only their wishes. Your opinions, no matter what they are based on, are only relevant if the patient thinks they are. That's what I think anyway.

You seem to be blurring lines, treating a patient appropriately is a medical decision, if you have advised the patient they need a treatment and they do not want it, then the doctor has still treated them in a medically appropriate manner. It is still done on medical basis only and not a religious one. Good doctors will respect a patients decision whether they agree with it or not.

true,GappyHilmore,IT,italy,"The back four is in decent shape, the only significant need would be a RB to cover to Ivanovic. Van der Wiel or Azpilicueta seem to be the top 2 on the market.

As for midfield I think someone that can eventually take Lampards spot partnering Mikel and switch out games with him next season. McEachren is promising but most likely going out on loan again, he has great technical ability but he needs to bulk up and get as many minutes on the pitch as possible. I like M'Vila but he isn't rumored as a Chelsea target. Modric is the most talked about rumor, I'm not convinced and I don't think Sp*rs will sell to us. If we do get another winger then move Ramires from the right back into the center and partner Mikel. 

IMO Hulk&gt;Hazard. Eden Hazard is a wonderful talent but I'd rather him go to City and draw press attention to them rather then us. With Drogba leaving this is officially Torres' time to shine and Sturridge can be his back-up. Signing another striker will just hurt Fernando's confidence and make him feel like he isn't trusted. This leads to why Hulk is a better signing than Hazard. Hulk can play as CF or winger that way if Torres doesn't return to his 18-20 goal season Hulk can chip in a score goals. Hulk is also a better goal scorer than Hazard. He has 21 goals in 38 competitions this season.

Players leaving: Drogba(farewell to a legend), Malouda &amp; Bosingwa(we can only hope) and possibly Essien/Kalou. I hope Ferreira gets a coaching job with the club.

As for Hazard, 20 goals and 15 assists in 38 league games last year, that hardly sounds like a selfish player, especially if he was given more effective strikers to set up. Also look at the other players who have won the french league player of the season. There is some absolute class there, let alone the last player to win it back to back (Pauleta as a 30 year old). Hazard is only 21, and would slot straight into our first team for the next decade, he's simply far too young and good to ignore.

Writing a petition to a politician isn't going to do anything, and the Avaaz article is just stirring emotional shit in the hopes of inciting people to sign their petition. Just because it's genital mutilation, it's emotionally targeted. I would be equally horrified if people were having fingers or ears, or any other body part damaged or cut off for no reason.

Avaaz say ""tens of thousands"" of cases, but they offer no proof of that whatsoever except that there are 166 complaints in four years. I agree that it is still 166 too many, but how you get from 41 reported cases a year to tens of thousands? And to claim that ""the authorities turn a blind eye"" isn't substantiated either. There was a new law brought in in 2003 to specifically ban female genital mutilation. The real problem is that women from those cultures will likely have these things done to them in foreign countries, and they are also unlikely to report it when in the UK.

In short, I don't like any of these deals. Malouda is on the decline, and I would not resign him unless he took a large pay cut. Essien is a shell of his former self, and as much as I love the man and the player he used to be, he needs to leave or at least take a massive pay cut.

Lampard is a tricky situation for me. I think he needs to stay for sure, and he is still an integral part of our team. The problem is that it is being reported that he is receiving a pay increase to be close to or on par with Torres's 10m pounds a season wages. That is bad news on multiple levels.

First, with FFP we cannot afford to have multiple players with those kinds of wages, especially since we might have another one or two coming in (someone like Hazard, Hulk, Cavani). It is true that with Drogba, Kalou, and Bosingwa leaving, we have some huge wage money being released, but I would rather be allocating that money to the wages of players that we hope to sign than to older players that we already have in the squad.

Second, with rules as they stand, Lampard's current contract does not contribute to FFP at all since it was formed before FFP rules went into effect. If we give him a pay raise of any kind, the entirety of his wages will need to be accounted for under FFP (i.e. if Lamps goes from 150k/week wages to 160k/week, his contribution to our FFP tabulations goes from nothing at all to almost 10 million pounds per year).

The situation is described in better detail [here at WAGNH](http://www.weaintgotnohistory.com/2012/5/24/3039938/frank-lampard-contract-extension-salomon-kalou-jose-bosingwa-transfer-news). I think Lampard deserves a bonus of some kind for doing what he has done for our club, but a player in his early to mid 30s (even one of his immense importance and stature at the club) needs to be taking a pay cut, not a pay raise.",0,1337828903,null,0,false,0,c4ro9uy,t3_u23vp,t1_c4ro9uy,t3_u23vp,null,1435714489,4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,4

I would guess that those funds will be directed mostly towards transfers, and that will take a huge burden off of our signings this summer with FFP on the horizon.

Another big plus with regards to finances is that Drogba, Kalou, and Bosingwa are all leaving, and these players were all on pretty huge wages (esp. Drogba). If we look at only wages for player signings this summer and match them up with wages from these three departing players, we will be able to sign one star player on Drogba-like wages and a few squad players on intermediate wages without incurring any increased contributions to FFP.

All things considered, winning the Champions League put us in a spectacular position to deal with FFP. We will have a big leg up on the transfer market because of the cash influx, and the timing of our victory coupled with the looming specter of FFP means that we are going to have plenty of room to spend on transfers this summer.

&gt;My long-held theory is that most managers will be lucky to get 50% of their signings spot-on. This is partly because, in a squad of 24+, you can’t have everyone you purchase in the side at once; and as such, some will seem like flops. And also, the fact of the matter is that, due to injuries, form, team understanding/wavelength, language and settling-in issues, and sometimes the need to adapt to a new role, new signings can often struggle to replicate the form that led to the move in the first place. Add the pressure of a club like Liverpool, and it can be tough for some to cope.

You read it [here](http://tomkinstimes.com/2012/03/in-depth-why-are-liverpool-struggling/).

Man City likely outspends every team in the Premier League but that being said - and if you subscribe to the 50% theory - they've put themselves in the position to have enough transfers to see at least half of them work out.

Sure - programming is more difficult in a Windows environment sometimes but hell there is nothing from stopping them using Linux as there are quite a few easy distributions now. 

I think the main problem here is that the teachers aren't skilled enough as they are mainly hired to teach office etc. and probably don't know much about programming.

I'm also surprised that schools don't use Arduinos more for DT etc. as they are pretty cool, and can also teach programming, but with a more physical end result. They also aren't too expensive.

Some might argue that things like the Arduino, Raspberry Pi, skilled teachers etc. would be too expensive - but it irritates me when the schools waste so much money on Microsoft licenses and contracts with companies for crappy software (the one at my school was so bad, I was able to reverse engineer it to be able to control every computer on the school network, and I could have sent my modified executable to any of my friends at neighbouring schools and it would have worked there as well). 

LibreOffice is a decent enough replacement for Microsoft Office now, and using Linux is arguably a better education than using Windows - think how much more efficient our offices could be if everyone knew some basic bash scripting?

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; surely it is easier to teach programming on a normal computer? Which schools already have many of? Sure - programming is more difficult in a Windows environment sometimes but hell there is nothing from stopping them using Linux as there are quite a few easy distributions now.

The problem is that schools have a requirement to teach Word and Powerpoint and all their classrooms are set up that way. I don't know if that's a literal requirement for the syllabus, I suspect so (i.e. students must be able to write a report not in a ""word processor"" but in Microsoft Word™) but even if it isn't, schools have standardised on Microsoft because it's easier, safe and familiar.

A local software development company talked on my town's IT mailing list about using Microsoft SQL server as their backend, and I asked why they chose that. The guy's response basically opened with ""naff off, and don't talk to me about MySQL"". Now I could have gone back and asked him, ""well, have you compared performance with PostgreSQL or any of the other alternatives"" but he maintained that not only do Microsoft make a good SQL server product (I have no idea whether this is true) but that his customers *expect* Microsoft. They would rather pay £800 or £1200 for a Microsoft license than learn about or understand the alternatives. And I don't mean the support element of that - that can be addressed by the supplier, I mean their managers will ask the question ""it's not Microsoft, what is it?"", fail to understand the answer and switch off. They'd rather throw money at the problem, because they recognise the Microsoft brand and they don't want to be confused.

So this is a massive barrier to Linux in the classroom - Windows is everywhere and installing anything else on the regular PCs is a ""risk"" and a ""problem"".

A motivated and knowledgable IT teacher could burn 20 or 30 Linux liveCDs and boot every computer with them (assuming booting from CDs isn't prevented by the school's IT policies), but this consumes time at the beginning of the lesson and it means that the system is volatile. The students have to save their work on a USB key and there's this risk that they save a file on the desktop (or wherever) and lose it if they forget to save it safely when they finish the session. I'm not sure if you can save a program with the executable bit set on a FAT filesystem, so that the student can save and run their file from the USB key - otherwise there's a risk that the key will be unreadable on a home PC and be formatted because it's believed ""corrupt"".

Now all these things are surmountable, but the Pi is attractive because it's small, cheap and self-contained. You just unplug the monitor and keyboard of the ""normal computer"", plug in the Pi and it's a complete environment. The student can take it home with them and plug it into their telly, and do homework there.

As you say, the problem is technologically illiterate teachers and managers. They were slow catching on two decades ago, and our politicians allowed themselves to be guided by ""the needs of business"" because teaching Powerpoint and Excel was something that they all understood (the teachers and the politicians).

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;That's not good enough. Why should I take you're word (and that all it is) without proof.

And yet you're quite happy to use generic info from a webpage when it suits your purposes - see what I mean about people searching until they get the info they want? Hence, 'talk to your GP'. That's why I'd never advise going by websites *or* word-of-mouth - if generic advice was that good, you wouldn't need to see a GP at all.

&gt;The burden of proof is with you, you're making the claim. 

Again, no I'm not. I'm repeating medical advice from several sources. There's a difference.

&gt;is no more proof than saying ""my mum said""...

Which part of 'talk to your GP' do you not understand?

&gt;You cannot base your argument on a figure that cannot be backed up

Again, if you don't want to acknowledge medical advice given to someone else, then talk to your GP. That's (at least) the sixth time I've said it. Nowhere have I said 'then everyone else is wrong'. In the last post I said 'if the figures have changed, then they've changed'. Which part of this are you not understanding? It doesn't change the underlying concern.

&gt;Non issue for most people. Clearly not for you. But for most its a genuine non issue.

It's an issue that's *ignored* by most people - there's a difference; ignoring it doesn't make it go away. It's important because the number of downs cases has gone up as the population has had babies at a later and later age - hence they make a point of mentioning age-related down's odds to all prospective parents. Now, if a couple wish to be parents when they're young enough that in a different world they'd have managed it without help, then great - but when couples have IVF because they've reached an age where they should be questioning how late they've left it instead of going straight to the cheating option (which make no mistake, a lot of couples do). This is a moral question that stands already - and yet it's now being suggested that extending this limit is an option, which will only make the number of downs kids go up, and the moral argument becomes more pressing  -which is what annoys me, really - these things should be addressed *before* we use science to make them worse, not a few years later when someone highlights the raised downs statistics when people start asking 'why was this allowed?'.

&gt;to allow people to make an informed choice. 

That's right - so what do you do when someone convinces themselves that betting against such bad odds is a good idea?

&gt;You think it should not be allowed because of the increased dangers,

Less 'not allowed', more 'people educated so that they don't ignore important issues (like the one above) simply because they've assumed that the need to have children can outweigh other priorities with no reprecussions'. And these dangers exist already, *before* we raise the age limit. Without some major advance in medical science, I think that's dangerous. You can tell people the odds of lung cancer for smoking, and they'll still do it - I don't understand why this sort of 'bah, I'll get lucky' attitude isn't taken more into account.

&gt;what was once not possible now it is, that's the point.

And yet a lot people generally don't realise how the likes of IVF, transplants and the like cut some very big corners in order to get a result. Sure, it's science - but not perfect science, so to speak.

&gt;But I am yet to meet a person with the attatude that having a child late in life would be easy or problematic.

This attitude is usually reduced to 'it might take longer to conceive'. My Wife and her mother are nurses, so you tend to get bludgeoned with medical knowledge in that situation - but it does give you an insight into how many people will not ask questions - or not ask *the right* questions.

&gt;younger would have been better.

We were in the same boat - if I'd have had them young and penniless, it would have been a much harder struggle, extra energy or no. We put it off until I was 34, and even then it took several years. We went for fertility tests and the like, just to be sure we weren't wasting our time, but we ultimately decided that if it didn't happen, it didn't happen; of course, we were chuffed when it actually did, but because of the decision we'd made we never felt pressure or time running out, because if it ran out...then it was never meant to be.

&gt;And I don't believe encouraging kids to get busy just incase you/or you other half has a problem is a good idea either

Certainly not to the degree where I live -which is sort-of near Croydon, which I think has the highest teen pregnancy rate in Europe :-O

&gt;Extending the age in the UK has nothing at all to do with the procedures in other countries. The article, this thread is about the UK. If at some point that changed I never saw it.

The point I was making is that biology doesn't have any rules or borders - extending the age in the UK isn't magically going to make UK women more able to have children at a later age with no increased risks. - and considering the extent to which people ignore the dangers *now*, I'm not sure of the value on increasing that danger. You may want to risk all in the name of having children, but when it's at the expense of a) the child's health and b) everyone else who will have to support that child after you've gone, then I consider that a problem.

Ultimately, my concern is the number of downs-afflicted babies is a problem already, because of the increasing birth-age. Extending this can only result in more problems.",0,1337850247,null,0,1337862745,0,c4rrhng,t3_tyzfx,t1_c4rrhng,t1_c4ri0ct,null,1428990034,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

FSG has had so much success with making annual, incremental renovations to Fenway (you know, the stadium in the group's name) and leveraging it's history as a tourist attraction in-and-of itself that they were always going to lean strongly in that direction.  The other reality is that American owners are not used to having to pay to build their own stadiums.  Part of the reason that Henry sold the Florida Marlins and bought the Red Sox was because Miami was unwilling to build them a new stadium (they just opened a new stadium this year).  In the US, the teams have a lot of leverage because they can threaten to relocate and so they get ""public financing"" of stadiums.  This is basically the state and/or city taking out bond debt to build for the team.  When I hear the ownership group talk about how it is not worth the investment to expand the capacity by 15,000, what I really hear is ""yeah, we're never doing that.""  I think that's part of the reason that they scrapped the 75,000 seat stadium plan; they didn't want to do that, either, but the argument sounds better when you are talking about a 60,000 seater.

I'm completely ok with this.  We have seen what unmanageable debt can do to a club.  We were fortunate to get out from under H&amp;G but there have been plenty of massive, historic football clubs that have been sunk by overextending themselves.  Most of us would like to have a big, beautiful new stadium with a title contending team of world superstars but that just isn't the reality right now.  FSG is going to continue to exert political and financial pressure on the city and the surrounding residents until they can get the necessary permits to renovate and expand the ground and then they will do that over the next decade.

A lot of that is down to the consumer expectations - indeed demands - for a bargain.

I used to work in Currys a decade ago, and we had a couple of kettles/toasters/irons always on half price sale, and each month we just swapped them around - one doubled in price and the other halved in price.

The same for most of the special offers - they were just the realistic retail price for the item and we just dumped £100 on top during the previous month to show a saving of £100 the following month.

If we didn't do that, they simply wouldn't sell otherwise.

Only discontinued items were offering genuine savings.

...however, around the same time Comet did a big thing about always offering the lowest prices on everything and no fake deals. They dropped the plan within a few months as consumers, in general, demand the perception of a bargain. The consumers want to see ""£100 off"" signs on washing machines etc.

It could be argued anarchy goes better with the left because it suggests a lack of social hierarchy, but in practice it is just a centralisation of economic power to a minority under the rule of one leading ideology something normally called the state that justifies itself as being of the people. The right again is a centralisation of economic power to a minority under the rule of one ideology normally called small government but big corporation that justifies itself as being for the individual, but of course it still likes to push nationhood.

Prior to the 90's you had to pay for a bank account with a monthly fee but you received NO credit interest on current accounts and whilst the bank provided loans and investment to business, generally at quite high rates. Savings accounts were separately operated, usually by savings banks or building societies, providing good savings rates as well as low risk investment in housing through providing mortgages. Building societies and savings banks were characterised by being share held by the savers and returned the profits through increased savings rates and lower mortgage rates. 

In the financial de-regulation of the 90's many building societies started current accounts (Nationwide being a notable one) which competed head to head with the existing retail banks but provided banking with credit interest and no fee. It was then that the banks matched the building societies and then many building societies converted to banks, become for profit for shareholders.

true,Bronzewik_Albion,lfc68,,"While I think our defense had a very good season (proven by the fact that Martin Skrtel was our player of the year) I was very disappointed by Pepe Reina's performance. I'm more than aware of the amazing service he has given to the club, and will admit that he has won us many a game in the past. I've just become increasingly aware of his dipping form over the past few seasons.

A lot of this frustration probably spawns from witnessing one of his game-costing blunders first-hand (Craven Cottage in December), but it has become increasingly frequent in his game. He's a good shot-stopper and invaluable when it comes to penalty shoot-outs, but I think we should be concentrating more on the league next season and maybe even looking into a more solid keeper; one who is more imposing in the air and is less prone to spills. You might say that it's not his fault that we lose; that we should be scoring 2 or 3 at the other end to make these odd mistakes unimportant. And this is true, we have been pretty pathetic in front of goal this year. But the top keepers might only have to make one save all game (Joe Hart at Villa Park is a good example). I think Reina almost seems to need a few easy saves to warm-up before he makes a great one. Unfortunately, we can't afford to have this kind of keeper, the way we play.

One of Reina's strengths is the counter-attack. Whenever he comes out to intercept a cross or a corner, he's always looking for a quick pass, via his hand or boot. The only problem is; we're not that kind of team anymore! We rarely look for the counter-attack these days, and apart from Suarez, we don't have the speed necessary up front to initiate one. A big reason for this is that we don't really have a central midfielder who is willing to spray the ball out wide quickly (Gerrard doesn't do it anymore, Alonso's gone). Our current central midfielders seem afraid of making that incisive pass, instead playing it out wide where we eventually run out of space (because Downing can't beat a man; another rant for a different day).

I'm not saying this is Reina's fault; just that he's not the type of keeper we need anymore. Rant over!",0,1337855869,null,0,false,0,c4rrxfk,t3_u2ghm,t1_c4rrxfk,t3_u2ghm,null,1428990240,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

95% is done completely as a joke. An outsider looking at reddit might say we're all a bunch of idiots with our adviceanimals and puns.

People on 4chan have proven to actually be good people (just with sickening humour) and it's just the way that the culture is with the b/tards.

The macho hard-man stuff is done completely in jest and is recognisable as a different type of meme/joke from a different culture. The fact that they are actually in shape when they do it is irrelevent; I regularly get my moobs out when I'm with my lads and join in and nobody bats an eyelid, nobody thinks ""Oh he's taking the piss out of them"" because they are actually thinking ""He's joining in the joke"".

true,emericuh,lfcflame,,"It still amazes me that there exists this perceived pressure (largely from the fans and media) to find a manager as quickly as possible. We should be a club with a 5 year vision and selecting the person to lead that charge shouldn't be done hastily.

In his captivating book *Soccernomics*, Simon Kuper points out that when a team needs a new manager, they almost always hire in a mad rush. Likewise, in a normal business of similar size and turnover, the average search process takes four to five months. Football fans, however, expect the replacement to be announced within a few days of the previous manager's departure. This leads clubs to sign someone to a multi-million pound, multi year contract, with little more than a few phone calls. Does anyone else see what a ridiculous way this is to run a global organization? It's no wonder that less than 25% of football clubs ever turn a profit.


Take for instance Liverpool's recent perceived ""snub"" from Swansea manager Brendan Rodgers. Many fans have bemoaned how embarrassing it is to be rejected, failing to realize that Rodgers wasn't rejecting the club, but the process itself. Most football insiders think Rodgers would accept the job if offered, but the notion of interviewing a broad list of managers is almost unknown in football. Instead, clubs choose from those that are available and a phone call is made to the agent. Little discussion of the new managers plan, expectations, or methods.


FSG is trying to do things different and managers don't like it. Furthermore, the media doesn't like it because it is being done in a quiet way, behind the scenes. Whilst we would all like for a new manager to be announced, I think finding the right candidate is far more important. When Arsenal wanted Arsene Wenger, they waited for several weeks while he finished his management commitments in Japan. 


We are hardly in a position to demand the top managers, but nor are things as dire as they are being painted by the media. Like it or not, LFC will have to enter in to a phase of redevelopment, on and off the pitch. It's a bold project and some managers won't want any part of it and the massive expectations that come with this club. But that shouldn't stop us from exploring as many avenues as possible.

**tl;dr calm the fuck down. whether we choose a manager today or in 3 weeks doesn't matter. the media is creating drama to goad the club in to revealing their hand.**",0,1337860628,null,0,false,0,c4rsctn,t3_u2l7c,t1_c4rsctn,t3_u2l7c,null,1428990434,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11

I totally agree with you that having such a personality can do wonders to a team, both morally and on the pitch. But, being blunt, these are paid professionals. I can imagine the best way to instill confidence in your defense is by making saves, and generally doing your job.

I can imagine it being tough losing your coach, especially if you have a strong emotional bond, but you can't lay the blame of a bad performance on Valero's departure. Reina's a keeper, he can't just forget how to do his job because his coach left.

I really hope that this blip in performance is just that, because I know that we'll never realistically sell him.

I don't really know where you gather all that from though, and I think you're realllllly reading into very little. Yeah, it's been a week and we don't have the press up their ass reporting to us. It's not the end of the world to me, personally I'm kinda happy that we didn't just bring someone in the day after, because then I'd be concerned with how long they were readying this plan without saying anything. 

&gt;it doesn't seem like much progress has been made..

Well, you're kinda just going on the fact that you've heard about those who we've approached (nothing even official, right?). it's gonna seem like not much progress until we actually get the official word that we have a new manager, don't you think?

&gt; I get the impression that FSG wantto import far too much of this baseball bollocks and try to apply it to football..

What does this even mean? ""this baseball bollocks"" - and where do you get this impression from? They haven't really done anything that has to do with baseball with Liverpool. They're different sports, and I don't really know what they could manage to attempt at Liverpool under the mentality ""Oh well we did this in Boston, let's try it there."" 

&gt; They seem to think if they put x number..

Again, where does this even come from? Because of the director of communications guy..? That's just about the only news we've had regarding people coming to the club. I don't really see where you're getting this undermining-of-the-manager concept. But in the grand scheme, is a club not comprised of a staff, all of which work together, anyway? I think we're meant, like all clubs, to have x # of comm people, transfer people (aka what, director of football and scouts?) all together forming who Liverpool FC currently are. Where the importance of the manager gets fit into this point is beyond me. I don't think anyone is trying to argue who's important.

I agree about the manager's importance and I think FSG's bringing Kenny in when they did and not just immediately throwing whoever they felt like it (like making Steve Clarke caretaker or something just to avoid a void [lolpun] in the staff) shows respect to that precise idea. If they wanted a quick solution to just plug a hole I think they woulda just phoned Rafa 5 days ago; instead they're putting thought into it and organizing what is a fairly massive decision.

I'd sooner see them quietly and patiently do their work than rush into anything for the sake of settling people down. 

On a final note, it doesn't piss me off that Kenny was sacked and it's interesting that you mention FSG not having a game plan. I don't think **Kenny** had a game plan. He spent a season tinkering with the squad and clearly favoring his signings to existing squadmen. We're due to see Maxi &amp; Kuyt likely go, Aqua and Cole return and Hendo and Downing flipping coins for starting positions. At no point through the season did I feel like I could rely on or expect Kenny to play a formation that we (both the squad and supporters alike) were familiar with. Between the frequency in changes to the formation and starting XI, first teamers playing along side reserve people, etc etc etc, the only thing we didn't really see this season was Suarez warming the bench. But we've seen just about every other random pairing of players together. I was wondering at what point we were gonna try something and stick to it and we just never did really. The only thing I can confidently say that I knew about what Kenny had in mind was 'young english talent' basically. Which isn't exactly a tactic, strategy, mentality or anything useful except for *maybe* helping us pick from rumors.

'They haven't really done anything that has to do with baseball with Liverpool. '

Hello Moneyball, how has that worked out re: Downing and Hendo? On paper with their stats they looked like super stars, the reality was far different though, crosses to the box != goals scored. Baseball is not football and thinking you can run a team based on stats when its a team game would always be a gamble, and quite frankly I dont think its paid off at all, nor will it. 

'Because of the director of communications guy..? That's just about the only news we've had regarding people coming to the club.'

Well we just got a new commercial director. From an interview with Ian Ayre recently: Director of football Damien Comolli, who was dismissed last month, won’t be directly replaced. FSG have come to the conclusion that his job, overseeing travel, medical care, scouting, player analysis and recruitment, was too wide-ranging. Instead those duties will be spread out and a number of new roles created. The manager’s role will also change. FSG want Dalglish’s successor to be devoted solely to coaching, although he will still have the final say on signings. 

So you see they're creating jobs, they're trying to 'streamline the business' and turn it into a money making scheme rather than a football club and that's pretty offensive to me personally. Yes you make money, this is the modern era blah blah blah but without our passion we're not really LFC, we're just another club. The whole idea of the manager being a 'coach' and other people making decisions and sorting things out means that FSG probably arent looking for a coach with a real clear vision if you ask me, people with clear visions tend to want their own way and that doesnt seem like it would be allowed in this structure. I dont want a weak minded manager who is happy to roll over just because some owners think he should do it that way despite the fact theyre clueless.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"One of the strange things about this sort of culture, in my experience, is it's often tied up with a certain ethos of achievement. It's work hard, play hard, essentially 'find out the easiest way to make your way through University to get the piece of paper required to get long-term status and money, and have as much fun as possible the rest of the time'. To an extent it is a recognition by students that University education is devalued from general expectations; it is not some precious flower, but a necessary evil to get a reasonable job. University used to mean serious contact between students and teachers, rather than simply listening to them in a lecture hall, and that meant genuine engagement with the passions and research interests of the staff. This engagement became more and more difficult in the 20 years from 1980 to 2000, as [expenditure per student halved](http://imgur.com/5RjDY), and student:staff ratios doubled ([source](http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/nmg/1468-0297.00102.pdf)).

So, this culture is a symptom of devaluation, but it also acts as reinforcement. Because the problem is that these people- who think it's a bit pointless to talk about their chosen subject out of class, who demand that lecturers stick to the syllabus and only teach what needs to be known for the exam, and who spend their free time paralytic or talking about being paralytic- these people piss over the education which everyone else wants, which is not just jumping through hoops, but involves learning things because they're interesting, and emerging from University with expanded horizons. So interested students are not only cut off from teachers but also from other students, by an interstitial spongy mass of lads and ladettes.

Despite the many evils of tuition fees, the New Labour reforms did at least increase spending per student [about 40% back up to where it was before](http://imgur.com/B6YmX), so hopefully the next generation of students won't be so fucked. But, in general, if I was making my decisions now, I'd probably just temporarily jump ship, and [go and study in Denmark or Sweden](http://imgur.com/YklSD).

Hence, 'talk to your GP'. That's why I'd never advise going by websites or word-of-mouth - if generic advice was that good, you wouldn't need to see a GP at all.

Iv referenced two articles now (both not generic, both about older parents/IVF Downs)...You have referenced none.


&gt;Again, no I'm not. I'm repeating medical advice from several sources. There's a difference.

Actually your right...In fact now I think about it...My GP told me I have super human strength, and I can leap whole buildings, and fly faster than a speeding built, he also told me that the risks of having a child with downs while being in my 40s was 1-80. I cant actually find any reference on line to back that up, but its okay because that's what my GP said so it must be true.

&gt;It's an issue that's ignored by most people

""Most"" - Proof please?

&gt;betting against such bad odds is a good idea?

If bad odds = 1/18 can I have proof of statistical reference please?

&gt;This attitude is usually reduced to 'it might take longer to conceive'. My Wife and her mother are nurses, so you tend to get bludgeoned with medical knowledge in that situation - but it does give you an insight into how many people will not ask questions - or not ask the right questions.

Proof please?

My mother was a nurse. My wife is a career for the elderly. My sister used to look after disabled children.

Except it's not. Roy got Fulham to 'overachieve' for *one* season (in a cup competition, not the league) using defensive tactics. Martinez has got Wigan to overachieve *every* season he's been in charge, and that too **in the league**, using attacking, passing football. People argue that Steve Bruce had better results than him - sure, but Steve Bruce's Wigan played like Stoke City, and we saw how hoofball went at Liverpool with Hodgson. Martinez is the opposite of that.

As for why keeping Wigan away from relegation every season is overachievement, this comes from [The Swiss Ramble](http://swissramble.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/wigan-athletics-unlikely-survival.html):

&gt; what Roberto has done is he has maximised the potential of that team and therefore if he goes to a better team, as long as we believe he can maximise the potential for that team, he will be successful.

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"I think you're jumping to a lot of conclusions here.

Word is (I have no proof of this) that the owners were badly advised when they first bought the club, and are now more confident in the people around them. They've also decided to back themselves and do things the way they know, which is by putting in this structure. I'm (optimistically) comparing it to Mike Ashley at Newcastle - when he first came in he was awful, he brought in the wrong people to handle things, but now that he's rid of them and doing things his own way, they're doing really well.

Mind you, Moneyball was also responsible for us signing Enrique; it hasn't been all bad. But the term's been abused a lot, and many of the Moneyball principles (not giving a manager massive funds in his first window, not panic buying when replacing a player, looking for statistical bargains) weren't followed at all. It's also been suggested that Comolli interviewed well, much better than he actually did in the job.

&gt; So you see they're creating jobs, they're trying to 'streamline the business' and turn it into a money making scheme rather than a football club and that's pretty offensive to me personally.

This is where I really felt you jumped to conclusions. If FSG wanted to create jobs, I'm not sure that a football club was the best way for them to go about it. They're putting in a structure similar to what they have at Red Sox - i.e. what they know and what they are comfortable working with - but in a style that matches what is used at many European clubs. Ajax have Cruyff as a (now unofficial) sporting advisor, and De Boer has Wim Jonk and Denis Bergkamp as a 'technical team'. This isn't job creation, it's about having enough people to cover a series of specialised roles. 

Brian Reade's book on the H&amp;G ownership, An Epic Swindle, criticizes the way the club was run under Moores &amp; Parry; we weren't pulling our weight commercially, and we took too long with transfer and contract negotiations (what other club would let Owen escape to Real Madrid so cheaply, last year of the contract or not?). If FSG's structure means we don't have these issues anymore, then fantastic. 

Also, I don't know how employing more people, and paying more salaries, makes more money; unless I misunderstood what you meant?

&gt;  The whole idea of the manager being a 'coach' and other people making decisions and sorting things out means that FSG probably arent looking for a coach with a real clear vision if you ask me, people with clear visions tend to want their own way and that doesnt seem like it would be allowed in this structure. I dont want a weak minded manager who is happy to roll over just because some owners think he should do it that way despite the fact theyre clueless.

If they didn't want a manager with a vision, they wouldn't be holding interviews - they'd just pick the most available person with the highest win rate, playing philosophy and squad management be damned. All the names we've reasonably been linked with play good, passing football, and aren't exactly tactical morons - that's the vision of the manager that they're after. I don't think that makes him a weak minded manager who rolls over - I just think it makes him someone who shares the idea they have.

But I do agree with you that they probably won't let a manager entirely have their own way, and that's why Rafa's not being considered. It's a damn shame, but I can see what FSG are trying to do. For example, look at what happens to clubs where Mourinho leaves - there's a massive void afterwards, and the only way for the club to succeed is for the manager to just become a Mourinho copycat. Meanwhile, even though Guardiola left Barca and his replacement has no managerial experience, nobody expects them to suddenly become awful; because there's a system there.

Yes our commercial side was awful in the 90's etc. as Reade points out, but to get the commerical side on board doesn't mean you have to overhaul the football side of things. From what I recall from that book it was mainly the running of sponsorship deals and merch that was criticised, not so much the contracts for the players. The best way to get great deals and create revenue from the commercial side is pretty obvious: Get success on the pitch. It's really not that complicated from where Im sat.

But I have to disagree with you further. I don't think Downing and Hendo were Moneyball this or that, and I personally dislike that being thrown around so often (see dangercart's reply for why). I think Downing/Hendo fit right into what Kenny wanted and were the types of players he wanted. Young &amp; English as he preferred. A winger to cross to Carroll and a midfielder to eventually take up Stevie's reins. I think it would be foolish to not take their statistical records at the clubs they came from into consideration when looking at them. But the way I see this, as simply as possible, is that young English lads were shortlisted and then had their stats compared. The best stats got picked; because who takes the guy in 5th place over the guy in 1st? They clearly weren't bought for their price tags being cheap or anything, and if it was just all stat-based signings then it would be quite a coincidence for them to both be..young and English.

Comolli said that he barely has any time to himself, that he's usually traveling, etc. I think that's wayyy too much for one person to do, and is only handled better by many hands rather than one. Why pressure one person? Analysis and recruitment is a full time gig alone, don't you think? If not, do you really mean to tell me that you'd sooner see someone apply less time to analyzing potential squad players so he can book flights and chat with the physios about fitness? I think i'd rather have a guy locked in a dungeon with a 16 foot tall book of player stats, studying it like a beast.

I don't see streamlining (which in reality is a good thing, making things more efficient) and job creation (which is actually just job rearranging much more than it is creating; they didn't just decide *we need someone to wash boot laces, we'll pay them $40k a week to do so and look immediately* or anything) as a bad thing at all, or into anything that amounts to a money making scheme. What is your definition of a football club then? These guys are addressing issues that we have, and if you don't think they're issues then why the hell did we just finish behind Everton..? How did you go from creating jobs to money making scheme and lack of passion. What IS passion if it isn't restructuring something that isn't working with intention to make it work? How and why are you speculating so far as to state whether or not FSG are looking for a coach with clear vision and concerned with having a weak minded manager who's gonna roll over, at all? 

I think you're overly paranoid and dismissing the owners and their business without any real reason, which makes you lacking passion, if anyone. Again, just my opinion, I don't mean to offend in any way; but you didn't really even answer to where you formed most of your opinions aside from just adding more speculation to your argument and noting that we're obviously making a lot of changes. I don't think they bought the club to just leave it as is. Consider the passion in spending a couple hundred million. There are much easier ways to make money if you've got money to throw around like that, and as you mention being living with bitters etc etc, I don't think you should really badmouth baseball the way you seemingly want to because you simply don't know about it. 

&gt; Yeah, maybe you should try living alongside some Bitters sometime mate, then tell me the way our business is being handled is all good. I'm with SOS on this one.

Seems a bit hostile to me. I don't need to live along anyone to tell you I'm okay with how our business is being handled. If you can't handle being jabbed at by your rivals, then what's the point really. You laugh in  their faces because they support Everton, period.

They own the club. Blackburn's owners imposed their god-awful structure on Blackburn, and honestly there's not much that the fans could do about it. Chelsea's structure consists of Abramovich meddling everywhere. On the other hand, Man City's owners imposed a much more professional structure at their club, and they'll reap success. Unless supporters become part-owners of clubs, the owners will put in whatever structure they want - we just have to hope FSG's is a good structure.

&gt; Owners exist to write cheques, not dictate how a team and club should be run down to every little detail.

This might have been true in the past, but what happens when other owners can write bigger cheques? The PL has changed football, and unfortunately Liverpool have never really caught up with that. Part of me's proud of that - but it hasn't won us a league title, either.

I'm not saying we become a Chelsea or a Man City who buy success (we can't anyway), or an Arsenal who put money above success.

First, one of the key elements of Moneyball is to seek *value* in transfers. Second, certain types of players are overvalued and you should avoid them. English players are almost without exception more expensive than their foreign equivalents. It's a fact and books like Soccernomics spell this out clearly with the supporting data. If LFC was being run on Moneyball principles, we would have never bought Henderson, Downing or Carroll.

Second, bringing the club toward financial solvency is not a bad thing, as you seem to imply that it is. Only 25% of Premier League clubs turned a profit this season, it is a dismal number and does not bode well for the future, when EUFA will implement Financial Fairplay Rules that prevent clubs from spending beyond there means. Simply put, if LFC wants to remain competitive, we **must** generate income. 

Finally, your assertion that the manager will simply become a ""coach"" is speculative, at best. We have no way of knowing that. Clearly, we are leaning away from the traditional English model and toward a model used by the biggest clubs in the world (Barca, Madrid, Inter, AC Milan, and almost every German club), but to say that will diminish the role of manager to coach is perhaps disingenuous.

On the specific point about Universities, I posted a wall of text below, but the key facts are that from 1980-2000 funding per student halved ([graph](http://imgur.com/5RjDY)), and student to staff ratios doubled ([source](http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/nmg/1468-0297.00102.pdf)):

&gt; The average student: staff ratio across the sector in 1980 was 9:1; by 1990 this had increased to 13:1 and by 1999 to 17:1 (23:1 if funding for research which is included in the average unit of funding is excluded). In effect, average class sizes in universities doubled in the last 20 years [up to 2000]. Not only has this led to ever larger lecture classes but also to the disappearance of small group tutorials in many universities.

It is absolutely inevitable that this will affect the culture of Universities. A student now is likely to have much less contact time with research staff outside of lectures, and likely to find both himself and the people that surround him to one degree or another disengaged. Students over the 1990-2005 period, myself included, were like people living in the fresh ruins of a once great city, and culture inevitably shifts to meet new realities. Although post-2005 [funding has increased again, about halfway back up to where it was](http://imgur.com/B6YmX), even if it fully recovered (which it won't), that sort of cultural shift will not be reversed overnight.

Also, beyond the specific case of students, in most European cities if you go out on a Friday or Saturday night you will see the entire range of the population on the streets, from young to old. Young people may be just as focussed (or more so) on going out, meeting friends, dancing, drinking, etc, but the atmosphere of intimidation is not there, and old and middle-aged people are happy to go out, and go to bars, cafes and restaurants. The 'riot van' drinking culture is not specific to Britain, but it is characteristic, and not at all a European or worldwide constant.

Then why didn't Dalglish just..do it, then? Why'd we switch the tactics up almost every week and come up with so few points? I think it's a little more complicated than you let on.

You don't know who's giving them business or football advice, so I think it would be wisest to stop frying them for all of their ""business"" decisions when they're the owners...and every decision they make can be looked upon as a business one. They own the club. Like it or not, it IS a business because people need to be paid in order to pull the shirt on or be staffed or whatever. You're painting these people to be out to make a quick buck or looking at the club for profits or something like that and they simply haven't exhibited a single thing that points to that. 

FSG have been respectful, super mindful of everyone at LFC and cordial through the whole way. Every interview with anyone has been wonderful, and I see no reason to be all up in arms about how they're going about things. I don't think you're really providing any either, you're kind of just..moaning about the owners.

&gt; Instead of putting a plan in place which is based on business, not footballing knowledge...

Didn't you just mention thinking that they didn't have much of a game plan on what to do after sacking Kenny? Apparently that lack of a plan was founded on business though, which makes no sense. Now you're being critical of a plan that doesn't exist, which is like speculation².

Yeah, this is frustrating. I don't see why they have to keep their advisors secret. Apparently David Dein's been spotted in their company a few times, and its known that they initially tried to get Cruyff in on a 'technical' role; he said no, but I think he's still involved in some way. I think - and I hope - it's not Ayre. The man's done good stuff financially for us, but I don't want another Fantasy Manager Purslow.

You make a good point in the second part. When the Glazers came in at United, the best decision they made was to stay the hell away from Fergie's setup. Maybe if Rafa was still in charge, with his system established, FSG would leave it be; I think they gave Kenny a chance to do things 'his way', and once that failed (by a very tough guideline of what counts as failure), they've decided to do things the way they know - hopefully with football people helping them apply that to a sport they still don't know enough about.

I can appreciate what they're trying to do - I'd love for Liverpool to develop a legacy and system the same way Barca and Ajax have.

And you need proof for this too? Since you're now so desperate to attack that you're not even paying attention, I'm now wondering why I haven't replied in a similar vein every time you've accused me of saying something I demonstrably haven't...oh, that's why - it makes for a boring conversation.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Maybe. The right likes this idea of the individual because it is quite seductive for the general population, but it never really seems to play out as advertised. It generally isn't the most power for the most people, but the most power for an individual. The left seem to go after the 'greater good' but they do it by creating a centralised power which to me is just stupid.

I reject the left/right paradigm, and these are all very fuzzy concepts that largely confuse people. If you want some fun ask the 'average joe' for a definition of left and right: if you are lucky they might say Labour/Conservative (but what makes Labour left and the Cons right? ""Eeeeerrrr.....?""), pro-worker/pro-employer, big-state/small state. There's already been a framing of of the economic model where even the two supposed 'opposite' schools are really fighting for the same thing: that there should be a set of workers working for a higher power. The left just wants an extra holiday for the workers and the right wants to take it away. (A linguist might add that the word 'right' is unfair on the 'left': right is the dominant hand, right is a synonym for correct, right as in human rights, left-handedness was a sign of the devil, you wiped shit off with the left to leave the right hand clean for eating and shaking hands. But I digress.)

Anarco-capitalism is particularly difficult as it contains two fuzzy concepts and the two-tiered social structure that is a requirement for capitalism seems at odds with anarchy. I did skip over a third fuzzy concept 'power', so I should define that: the ability to coerce a desired behaviour. A proper definition probably would include a projection of will or a 'should'. Monarchy is obvious with a royal decree for example, and this more human definition feeds back into the centralised/dispersed scale. A better reading of anarchy could well be without coercion.

For AC there is a focus on the 'private' opposed to 'public' but what do these mean in practice or even in law? When is a fetus/child/wife(!) not the private property of another? It all gets a little absurd and even more so when I think of 'intellectual private property'. This takes us back to the idea of the projection of will over a set of things, colloquially 'ownership', and if you can project will over a person you effectively own them too, you can coerce them to do things they wouldn't do otherwise. In the most obvious form that is called slavery, more subtle would be the corporation, nationalism and anyone in it for the money.
 
So, to judge AC I don't care about left/right but whether it would promote the least ownership over the least number of people, or in other words, the most wealth for the most people with persistence across generations.

I can't continue something I haven't been doing - but you seem to repeatedly apply this notion to stuff you don't know about. Shall I quote (or count) the number of times I've had to show how I haven't said something you've insisted I have? Of course, if you quoted me then you could point out where you think I've been doing this, and I could address it. But attacking is so much more important...to you, at least.

&gt;If you are unable to please just say so

Already did. At least twice. Or don't you remember 'if the figures have changed, then they've changed'? Or me quoting that a second time? Or suggesting that you ask a professional instead of using websites and how even doing that can be dangerous? Or pointing out that ultimately, the odds are still going to be unacceptable?

&gt;Why not...seems my GP is bigger than your GP is a principle you are happy to base your ""facts"" on.

No, that's the principle you've been working on in several areas, unless the info doesn't tally with what you want in which case you cherry-pick the parts that you like. Shall I quote where you've done this, starting with the BBC? And in any case, I never stated anywhere that my GP's advice was all-encompassing - just that I'd give his opinion more weight than a generic website. I've also gone out of my way to illustrate that the figures he, a consultant and two hospitals gave us aren't set in stone, so talk to your GP etc. I'm now even more interested in what you're trying to avoid, because I can't work it out and there must be something when you're so desperate to argue over stuff like this to the point of ignoring all of the replies.

&gt;I asked for Proof on the statement of the word ""Most"". 

The average age of people having babies is going up, and the majority of these aren't appearing via IVF. So, what word would you use to describe the larger part of that group? See what I mean about reading instead of attacking?

&gt;im not sure

Er....righto.

&gt;but you should ask yourself that question first as it was you who brought it up first.

My Wife/ MiL are nurses, they deal with people who haven't asked the right questions and leave medical issues longer than they should. A valid reason for pointing out their occupation - is this a comprehension issue for you, now? Especially since you're now at the point of replying with stuff that doesn't have any relevance, and then asking me what the relevance is when you only have to read the comment mentioning them for it to make sense.

&gt;Here is a question - do you believe the 1/18 statistic is still true?

At the time, why not? Now...it's a bit irrelevant, but if they've changed I'd want to know what has happened in the four years since our last child that has changed these figures - I just googled and found several posts from twenty-somethings panicking because their doctor has given them similar figures in the past year or so.

&gt; I cant stress enough how much I do not want Martinez..Thats almost the same logic we used when we chose Roy!

Except it's not. Roy got Fulham to 'overachieve' for one season (in a cup competition, not the league) using defensive tactics. Martinez has got Wigan to overachieve every season he's been in charge, and that too in the league, using attacking, passing football. People argue that Steve Bruce had better results than him - sure, but Steve Bruce's Wigan played like Stoke City, and we saw how hoofball went at Liverpool with Hodgson. Martinez is the opposite of that.

As for why keeping Wigan away from relegation every season is overachievement, this comes from [The Swiss Ramble](http://swissramble.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/wigan-athletics-unlikely-survival.html):

&gt; They have the lowest revenue in the top tier, just about the smallest crowds, the highest reliance on television money, one of the highest wages to turnover ratios and no cash.

Also, I refer you to [John Barnes' recent interview](http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/barnes-on-lfc-barca-future):

&gt; what Roberto has done is he has maximised the potential of that team and therefore if he goes to a better team, as long as we believe he can maximise the potential for that team, he will be successful.
Hodgson's style of football was never going to maximise Liverpool's potential. Martinez's is far more likely to.

I don't know if Martinez will do great, but I just don't like people calling him a mid-table manager, and/or comparing him to Hodgson. ",0,1337870397,null,0,false,0,c4rttro,t3_u2qnv,t1_c4rttro,t1_c4rtnho,null,1428991134,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

Donovan isn't going anywhere.  He is tied to LA by the MLS as a designated player allowing him to be paid above standard MLS rates.  He has a pretty sweet setup in LA and i don't see him picking up to move any time soon.  He is a very good player, but what we need on the wings, Hoilett is the better solution as he would actually cost less and allow us to focus on some of our other needs.

Dempsey i would love to have as i think he is just one of those guys who has a knack for scoring. Problem is, especially after last season i think he rightfully would prefer to start.  He won't start for us as he would be behind Bale on the left and VDV at support striker. I suppose you could play him on the right but Lennon (in particular how the team played when he was injured) is a fairly important part of how we attack.

Plus i think Donovan has more or less said that if he ever went to England the only team he would want to go to is Everton.

He built the Swansea team that is now amonst the prettiest in the League, he then set up Wigan to play the same way and despite missing their best creative options, stuck to his guns when things were going bad and went on of the most historically brilliant runs by a team to stave off relegation. Ian Holloway has gone on the record to say that he went to Martinez and shadowed him to learn the systems to set up at Blackpool, who now play the best looking football in the Championship.

There is certainly questions about whether Martinez can translate his ideas to a big club, whether the fans will have patience and the old guard will listen. But there is no doubt that Martinez plays some of the most elegant football going round, is a manager with a massive future and will almost certainly be working his way up the managerial ladder in the next few years.

Do you know that LOCOG (otherwise known as the British taxpayer) had to buy up all the advertising slots at major transport hubs which ticket holders might pass through to go to the games? So that's airports, Underground stations, Overground stations, train stations, buses, etc, etc. They also have to buy up all advertising space a couple of miles around the Olympic venues.

&gt;The contract requires British customs officials and London police to confiscate all non-licensed goods bearing the Olympics name or logo, be they fake T-shirts or marzipan renderings of the five Olympic rings on cakes in bakery windows. To help officials do this job, the contract stipulates that “brand protection teams” must be formed to roam the city. Inside Olympic venues, spectators may not “wear clothes or accessories with commercial mes­sages other than the manufacturers’ brand name.” London must ensure that there is no non-official propaganda or advertising in the airspace above the city while the Games are going on, and for two weeks prior. No Olympic venue, and no access routes to any Olympic venue, may be decorated in any way “that would conflict with or cause a breach of any” official Olympic corporate sponsorship. London must “obtain control of all billboard advertising, city transport advertising, airport advertising etc. for the duration of the Games and the month preceding it to support the marketing programme” of the I.O.C.

And as darkhunt3r said (in a sense), it would require an infinite amount of energy to accelerate something massive to that speed.

Your experience of people you regard as 'lads' on a night out is not a good representative sample of the people who would categorize themselves, or be categorized as 'lads'. I also hang out with people who may be regarded as ""stoners, skaters, and people from the hardcore scene"", in fact all of my housemates smoke weed, I skate, and one of them is in a hardcore band.  From my experiences I find the stoners boring and terrible on a night out, and I haven't failed to see several fights break out at everyone of the hardcore gigs i've attended.  As for intimidation, this is something i've found to be more prevalent at skate parks than on nights out with 'lads'.  But I realise that my experiences are not necessarily representative of these groups as a whole, and I don't judge people just because I've had bad experiences with people who have fit into these groups before. 

And so what if lad culture is a result of overprotective parents?  You blame the children for that?

It's ""worked"" for thousands of years. Human migration has frequently revolved around moving to find work. The reason there are so many Asians in the UK is because we gave them financial incentives to emigrate in order to help rebuild after the destruction and depopulation of WW2. At times it's essential. 

It's only in recent years that we've drawn lines on the map and restricted things. That's part of the problem, I'm sure most illegals would gladly become legal if given the option. I'm all for increaced visa allocations backed by harder clamp downs on illegals. The best way to eliminate the latter is to make being legal the preferable choice. Make it so that anyone with a clean criminal record can get a 1-2 year visa to help their families out financially. I know many British IT and tradespeople who have done the exact same thing. A couple of years ago several were in Dubai for example.

AV is actually a fairer system, yet they managed to convince people not only that it isn't, but that by not voting against it they were letting their country and their traditions down and making things worse. They literally lied to get people to vote against it; I had an intelligent friend of mine spew the same false bullshit at me when I said I was pro-AV. 

It shouldn't have been a vote in the first place, it's actually just a fairer system. All three major parties use an AV system to elect their leaders.

The problem is that there are such things as 'career politicians', that a person needs skills of exhibition and public relations and marketing in order to get into power. The most fair, skilled, suitable man in the world might never get a chance because he doesn't have enough funding backing his campaign. The entire system is corrupt, and skewed towards small private interest groups, which is the exact opposite of what a democracy is.

In ancient Greece they used to select their representatives via lottery, random selection. I think that's what they should do here; pick the MPs like they pick Jury Duty. We think a board of jurors are fair right? They make fair decisions, even though they don't have an in-depth understanding of the laws themselves? I honestly think a board of randomly selected MPs could vote on issues in a much fairer way than parliament currently does, free of financial biases and lack of fair representation. The job would be prestigious and fairly well-payed, and you could turn it down, and you couldn't do two terms in a row. 

There'd be no more rich boys doing the Oxford PPE course so they could later run the country. There'd be no more private organisations lobbying for certain laws via campaign contributions. Just honest, randomly selected adults, reading what a law entails and deciding what to do about it.

Having such a document will help avoid disagreements later on, he said. It’s also true that, once the Games were awarded to London, the balance of power between the I.O.C. and London slightly shifted in London’s favor. If the McDonald’s counter in the Olympic Village turns out to be a few square meters smaller than the I.O.C. technical manuals decree that it must be, Jacques Rogge is unlikely to call a screeching halt to the Games. Still, one understands why the English magazine The Spectator, which publicized excerpts from the contract, might argue that “British authorities have cravenly agreed to let the I.O.C. create what is, in effect, a state within a state.”

&gt;**The contract requires British customs officials and London police to confiscate all non-licensed goods bearing the Olympics name or logo, be they fake T-shirts or marzipan renderings of the five Olympic rings on cakes in bakery windows.""** To help officials do this job, the contract stipulates that “brand protection teams” must be formed to roam the city. Inside Olympic venues, spectators may not “wear clothes or accessories with commercial mes­sages other than the manufacturers’ brand name.” **

true,ax4of9,null,null,"You were getting a little agitated there, so I held off on commenting until I could see where you were going. A few points I disagree with, a few that I do. 

1. The whole moneyball argument has been taken way out of context by the media, you really shouldn't believe that what the media has been saying. There is ample proof that if the owners wanted to follow the moneyball approach, it wasn't kept to by Comolli. Moneyball requires getting value for money, both in the short term as well as the long term. The prices we paid for Downing and Henderson and Carroll were in no way according to the principle. At the most, someone looked at sabermetrics and forgot about the value part. On the other hand, both Adam and Enrique were good buys according to moneyball. At around 7 million each, both are easy to offload for close to zero loss. Also take into account that for the first half of the season, Enrique was considered an absolute steal. Adam, while dropping off after Lucas was injured, was still better than Henderson. 

2. While some may say that the current turmoil smells familiar to the previous owners, we have to remember that not only are we not in debt, but the owners invested heavily in the transfer market for us. That counts for a lot, because right now, we are nowhere close to being in financial danger. Our wage bill is very manageable, and with the strength of the Warrior kit deal, we are probably more sound financially than most Premier League clubs. Arsenal might be better off, but they also have the most expensive tickets in the country. Being financially sound may not account for much to you, but it means the club is set for the long term. Any crisis at the club right now is solely a footballing one. 

3. Which brings me to the most important point: the manager. I have been maintaining that the owners must take a certain degree of blame for the rushed appointment of Dalglish and his subsequent sacking. However, I have also come to realise that we, as fans, must take certain responsibility for Kenny's appointment as well, since our voices were the loudest in support for him to get a long term contract. The problem was, however, that our enthusiasm was fueled by the release of long term frustration under the previous owners and Hodgson, as well as nostalgia towards King Kenny. We only saw the fairytale return of our club legend, and failed to notice that he did nothing more than raise the morale of our players and let them play however they wanted. Our players had been stifled by Hodgson's style of football, and the release of pent-up energy, while spectacular, was nonetheless unsustainable. By being overly eager to cast away the clouds of gloom over the club, we declared that a return to glory was imminent without filling in the numerous cracks which had developed. Momentum carried us through the first 6 months, but it showed that it could not last forever. 

4. I was as angry as anyone when Kenny was sacked. Possibly more. I spent days on r/soccer throwing snide remarks at anyone with a Liverpool crest who dared to suggest that the sacking was right. I still believe that Kenny should have been given 1 more year, but I have since realised that this was borne out of a desire for stability, not football reasons. Right now, I believe that Kenny would most likely have improved us had he been given one more year, but he would plateau and we would still need to find someone else to bring us into the future. Appointing him in the first place delayed our re-building, sacking him now shortens the delay by 1 year. Yes, he might have put us back into the Top 4, but I don't see him leading us to be champions. For all the financial benefits and prestige of being in the Champions League, I'm not here to be a Top 4 club. I've waited more than 20 years for us to win the title, I'd rather wait a slightly longer period to become Champions, than to wait a shorter period to be a Top 4 club. We've been a Top 4 club ever since the Premier League begun, I say enough is enough. If we need to take risks to be champions, then by God I say we should take the risk. 

5. And risk is the key when it comes to appointing a new manager. I made a very detailed post a few days ago stating very strongly why Rafa should not be our next coach. I'm on my phone so I can't link it, but I hope you'll go through my posting history and give it a read. The title was pretty self-explanatory. Basically, I believe that our next manager needs to be equally good at man-managing and tactics. He must be able to set in place an actual tactical layout for the club while remaining flexible to the challenges when facing different opponents, all the while staying true to the tactical shape. These requirements are harsh, but I believe they are what we need to become champions. All the current managers who are considered tactically astute have this. Mourinho, for example, can take the same line-up and the same formation, and play ultra defensive in one match and fast attacking football in another. Managers like Ferguson, Wenger, Mourinho, Guardiola all have similar qualities. Additionally, they all have superb man-management skills. You can hardly find a former player of theirs who have a bad word to say about them. To me, neither Rafa nor AVB have these qualities, and Rafa worse than AVB. Rafa is no doubt a superb tactical, but it seemed like he treated each match as a game of chess. He played a style depending on what the opponent's strength was. In other words, he is reactive, a very good counter but not so strong in taking the initiative. The result was that our teams were chopped and changed every other match. Players were being played in a myriad of ways, playing different styles and formations week after week. The result is that there is no continuity. The closest we got to any sort of football identity was a team sturdy in defense and quick on the counter, but even then it was a generalization. There were so many games where we had overwhelming possession but did not seem to know what to do with it. Because we had no tactical philosophy and continuity, we relied on reacting to what our opponents did instead of having a clear attacking plan that only needs to be tweaked slightly according to our opponents. Rafa has never been able to create his own football philosophy. Compare this to Mourinho. 4 years after leaving Chelsea, Chelsea still finds the best result by playing the ""Mourinho way"". He didn't just buy good players, he bought players who were great for his style, but possibly no one else's. 

What Rafa and AVB have in common is an evident weakness in man-management. There have been numerous cases where former players criticise their training methods and personalities. They are so focused on their tactics that they sometimes forgot their players are men and not robots. AVB may have been forced out by player power, but who can deny that forcing veteran players to train separately from the first team was an antagonistic move? He was overeager to impose his own style on the team, and too stubborn to take the time to adapt based on the players which he had. 

Based on the so-called shortlist of candidates, I would like to state my unequivocal support for Roberto Martinez. I have prepared a detailed article on why I have chosen him, but would prefer to wait for an actual appointment to be made before I unleash a mini-novella on our subreddit. This comment is too already too long, but I hope that it might soften the views of those who are strongly opposed to him. 

Finally, let me just say that I understand your frustration with all that has been happening with the club. The media speculation is unavoidable, and it has created a lot of mixed feelings among us fans. What I would like you to do once you are done venting your frustration, however, is keep an open mind and at least give everyone the benefit of the doubt. It doesn't help the club to be naysaying almost 3 months before the season even starts, and at the end, our job is to support the club. The lyrics of our anthem is always suitable in times of adversity, we just have to remember that we need to be on the same side as the club.

&gt;Despite the arguments in favor of his appointment, several youth coaches, including Marc Overmars, Wim Jonk, Japp Staam and Dennis Bergkamp, claimed in the press and to the Dutch court that Van Gaal would be counterproductive to the youth movement occurring at the club.

Granted many of those coaches were in Cruyff's camp from the start, there is that whole ""where there's smoke, there's fire"" saying, which worries me a bit. I honestly don't know enough about Ajax to know whether this was courtroom bluster or not, but as [severedfragile said](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/tzx98/louis_van_gaal_in_line_for_sporting_director/c4rdn2p), you seem to be quite knowledgeable, so I figured I'd throw this question out there and see if maybe you had the answer I would run with.",0,1337886283,null,0,false,0,c4rxhpb,t3_tzx98,t1_c4rxhpb,t1_c4riifz,null,1428992917,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Fellaini would probably be around to help him settle too

I really hope Marin isn't counted in the 3/4 he's talking about bringing in, and Hulk isn't the striker he may have hinted at. This is going to take some serious investment to get us competing for all competitions next season so if anybody wants to start praying, go for a combination of Modric, Hulk, Hazard, Falcao/Cavani and a RB

true,crucible,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt;As for Microsoft, it will always be in schools because teachers of other subjects might not have the technological capabilities to use anything else. The IT staff is underpaid and stretched too thin to implement anything else. If you put Libreoffice in front of some teachers they wouldn't know what to do.

LibreOffice is a total non-starter for schools sadly for several reasons:

1) Ease of deployment - you will need an .msi file to install it and Group Policy templates to configure it on most Windows networks, especially if they have a management interface on top from the likes of RM or somebody. If you can't set Group Policies for software most schools IT Managers don't want to know. Period.

2) Staff familiarity. As you say teachers of other subjects need to use the IT suites, some classes might use IT once or twice a term at most. This will also be a problem for schools moving forward from older versions of Office such as 2000, XP or 2003 to anything newer.

3). Integration with things like SIMS.Net. This is the central database for schools. It contains all sorts of things - pupil details like home address, next of kin, medical info, records of behaviour etc. It's also heavily tied into Windows and Office. It can do letter templates and mail merges straight into Word. But only Word 2003 and newer. There's no option at all for any other office suites.

So you'd need Capita to change that, which is unlikely without significant demand from schools.
