true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;To sidestep godwin, have you consider that we might be the bad guys?

Good guys and bad guys is too simplistic. When you get to the scale we're at all sides do good and bad. Sometimes the right decision at the time is awful in hindsight.

In WW2 we teamed up with Stalin to fight the Nazi's. They were ""bad guys"", but then, so was Stalin. Hitler caused the death of maybe 10-20 million people, depending on what you blame on him. Stalin? Far more. Somewhere in the region of 40 overall off the top of my head.

Were we bad guys for teaming up with another bad guy, who was helping us kill a bad guy? It's complicated.

I'm not a utilitarian so I don't go for ""net good"" and ""net bad"", I just tend to think that individual morality must be obeyed by the individual in question, and that's how I live. Am I on the side of the ""good"" guys? Not really. Am I on a side with lots of good guys? I think probably. Are there lots of good guys on any other ""side"" you choose to pick? Sure. But British culture doesn't have the same level of nastiness built into it that some others do. I ramble, and this is complicated, but I'm probably not so ignorant or unthinking as you would imagine.

&gt;If we go for the shitty human rights element then why not China or Saudi?

We need oil, and we can't afford to fight China. Simple as that. Morality doesn't have to be enforced on all to make it valid to enforce on some. If I can stop a rape of a lady because the guy is smaller then me then I should. If I can't stop it because 20 guys with guns are doing it, it's not immoral to then later stop a small guy.",0,1335558953,null,0,false,0,c4hea8u,t3_srwre,t1_c4hea8u,t1_c4he2yl,null,1428810156,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Sure, drugs are bad. Whatever. 

But does anybody think, for one instant, that a kneecapping of an 18 year old will stop that? Fuck you if you do, because here's the deal:

* That kid is a small time dealer. I know because to be honest I'll probably find out tomorrow that I know him. He works for some guy, who works for some guy, who ships it in, and nobody gives a fuck about the guy one step down the chain
* Everyone else will come out tomorrow and say ""Aw, wee Micky got himself kneecapped by the boys. Shouldn't have got caught."" And move on.
* Nobody gives a fuck what RAAD think. I could get drugs if I wanted to. Right now. I could sell them if I wanted to. Right now. RAAD aren't going to stop me, because if I'm taking drugs the urge to take drugs is far stronger than the slight chance that you'll get shot. And if you're going to deal drugs you've already got the brassneck to brave a prison term, so a shooting isn't going to be much of a deterrent. Especially since you get a warning before being kneecapped anyway.

Personally I think it's only a matter of time before these hard men send out a threat to the wrong person, and get themselves into a lot of trouble.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Yeah, they do remember it. In regards to the marriage, see some other replies I have made. But anyways, I'm not the fanbase. The idea of the Doctor marrying and having a sexual relationship (and/or family) is not something I have a hard time accepting.

I have a hard time accepting a sexual relationship/marriage with River because it doesn't seem like the Doctor returns the emotions that River has- and River is obsessed with him to near sociopathy. All of Moffat's young female characters meet him at a young age and then become obsessed with him. But the Doctor doesn't seem to be in love with River. Compare his emotions to how 9 and 10 acted towards Rose and 8 towards Charley. They definitely loved each other romantically (8 actually says it to Charley).

But I no problem with the Doctor doing it or marrying or having a family. He had sex in The Dying Days 8th Doctor novel (heavily implied), he has a mutually romantic relationship with Charley and Rose (not at the same time), he has a granddaughter (Susan), a brother (Irving Braxiatel), a great grandson (Alex), 45 Cousins, parents (Salyavin/Borusa/Ulysses nobody knows), a mother (possibly EoT woman), and possibly 13 kids and a wife/S.O. named Patience (The Infinity Doctors).",0,1335560949,null,0,false,0,c4hepjl,t3_sui2v,t1_c4hepjl,t1_c4hbly5,null,1428810356,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I will miss them both equally because I think their relationship and their different relationships with the Doctor bring a lot to the show.

Amy is someone that the Doctor will do anything for.  She's his most important person and harming her brings out a dark and dangerous side.  Amy on the other had, really matures from being with the Doctor.  She changes from a young girl with blind faith in her imaginary friend to someone who sees the Doctor for the flawed person he is.

Rory, on the other hand, is someone who challenges the Doctor and makes him live up to the ideals the Doctor wants to while also learning to be more assertive himself.  Rory is the most vulnerable and outwardly kindest of the cast and he's often the moral compass for the rest.

I love Amy and Rory together because they're two people experiencing an adventure together.  Their relationship is often challenged and they are two extremely different people as Rory is kind and open while Amy is afraid of caring too much, but ultimately would do anything for each other.",0,1335563142,null,0,false,0,c4hf5j9,t3_svmet,t1_c4hf5j9,t3_svmet,null,1428810566,14,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,14

Bare in mind those cars are on the go 24/7 they don't get a break like your car. We have ones with over 100,000 miles on the clock where I work.

Dude.  Those 100k vehicles, now limited on the speedometer after the police have downgraded them, go to auction.  You know why they sell?  Because the helicopter in the sky the tax payer pays for means, and the cameras in the street, means the guys might as well be following in panda cars, literally, or Skodas.  You wanna hit me with cost efficiency again? Christ 100k, why aren't they running them to 200k at least?  They get regular service.

&gt;. Oh you need another £40m for the opening of the Olympics, sure no problem, ned to fund a war oh have some cash for that

I think you forget who is whose boss here.     

I am.     

We are.     

 If you are a civil servant.  I am your boss.    

Don't you dare lecture to me.  Or tell me.   

You may  inform me, but  then don't try to threaten the public who pays your way on the threats if you don't do your job.   You just crossed the line if you did.

You certainly crossed the line in trying to exploit an ongoing crisis, with people in harms warm, to fuel your own wallet. .

There is OpenOffice and it's derivatives, but they really aren't as good, and if you don't need Office 2010 then Google Docs et all is probably a better choice. 

Essentially, for the average user there really is no reason to switch to Linux on the desktop. Windows might cost money, but when you buy a PC it will come with Windows (unless your a geek, like me, who builds their own machine) so no one really factors in the cost of Windows when buying a PC. Linux doesn't have any obvious advantages which would make it worth while reinstalling either, at least none your average user would want.

&gt; Can you imagine being shot at with nothing but a stupid wooden stick to defend yourself... all because idiotic civilians have a completely irrational fear of firearms?

In the United Kingdom, the majority of police officers do not carry firearms, except in special circumstances. This originates from the formation of the Metropolitan Police Service in the 19th century, when police were not armed, partly to counter public fears and objections concerning armed enforcers as this had been previously seen due to the British Army maintaining order when needed. The arming of police in the United Kingdom is a perennial topic of debate.

true,TheMightyShrub,null,[Surrey Scally],"Also worth noting that Heathrow isn't actually anywhere near central London. If you're taking the Midland, you'll need to leave from London Euston. Best way to get there is by tube - Heathrow has it's own tube stop (one for each terminal), and it's on the Picadilly line (Dark blue on the tube maps). Take a tube from Heathrow all the way to Leicester Square, then change there onto the Northern Line (Black on the tube map), towards Euston. The signs are fairly clear with regards to which platform you need, and if not, tube maps are everywhere. I would recommend having a look at a tube map before you go though, to familiarise yourself with how it works. There's nothing worse than being in a foreign country, jet lagged and lost, staring at a map that doesn't make any sense.

If you do get lost or confused, try and find someone who works for TfL (Transport for London) instead of asking passers by. Although I'm making a massive generalisation, and there are some REALLY nice people in London who will go out of their way to help you, the majority of Londoners, especially those on the tube are either in a hurry, generally just rude, or lost tourist themselves, so it's best to save yourself the time and embarrassment and just ask some staff if you're lost.

Once you get off at Euston, just follow the signs for the mainline trains (it might be labelled as National Rail Services) and you'll end up on the ground level station. It's worth noting (as I'm guessing you're travelling with suitcases) that there IS a lift (elevator?), and you don't have to take your cases up the escalator, even though it looks like you do. If the escalator is on your left, the lift is straight ahead and round the corner to your right. It's not very well sign posted.

Make sure you arrive in PLENTY of time for your train. You never know when there might be a delay on the tube, and even if there isn't, it's a lost of stairs, and it's a pain in the ass with cases. You don't want to be rushing for your train, because you may not be able to find anywhere to put your cases once you're on the train. Try to aim to get to Euston about an hour before your train, that way you can go and get a seat and put your bags on the rack as soon as it's open for boarding. Bear in mind that it takes about 2 hours on the tube to get from Heathrow to Euston, maybe even longer. Do your research, and then give yourself an hour longer than you think you need. There's plenty of places to grab some food or just do some shopping once you get to Euston, and it's way better to be early than late.

Once you've booked your train tickets, let me know which stations you're changing at (if any). I know most of the stop over stations, so I can probably give you a heads up as to which platform your connecting train will be at, which is handy, especially if it's a tight connection.

My reasoning is that as a trained marksman, an officer with a weapon should not hesitate or compromise his or her training by waiting for the outcome of a situation when a firearm is involved. Perhaps I have watched too many US traffic ""stop and search"" videos on Reddit. Usually when a firearm is involved nothing good happens to the perp. In this case it did, but I truly believe the officer should have fired on that guy for drawing a weapon in a public place. His training didn't teach him to asses whether a weapon was fake or real, just to eliminate a plausible threat and I strongly believe a man carrying a weapon in public, and then drawing it on the arrival of the police, is a plausible threat. I am massively anti-gun, be it in the hands of the police or the public, and I am truly elated there was a good outcome to this story but it makes me wonder - whats the point in having police with firearms in the first place if they are not prepared to use them when faced with a man drawing a weapon?",0,1335572292,null,0,false,0,c4hgt1d,t3_sview,t1_c4hgt1d,t1_c4hfdjy,null,1428811374,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

Yeah. The Illusion that Amy saw of Rory turning old and going insane was an illusion created by HOUSE.

And additionally, Amy didn't need to eat because time was dilated in a way where she didn't need to (she even says she's not hungry after two weeks of isolation).

This, however, does not explain why Amy still ages normally despite not actually eating the mass required for her skin and body to transform in that nature.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Agreed. It does need work. I'm a little confused by how many different typefaces there are. I counted four, and that seems way unnecessary for something like this. The white outlines on the thumbnails makes it feel like a pop up ad rather than integrated with the overall design. Since there's no other blaring white in the layout, it looks out of place. 

The kerning looks a bit tight on ""Time"" between the ""M"" and ""E"", and I don't think the period is necessary after ""Gallifrey"". Add a period after ""Moffat"" if you're going to keep the one after ""invasion"" or get rid of them both. The leading on all those subheaders needs to be loosened up a bit. The space between ""seeing""'s G and ""OMEGA""'s O is too close.

""Sontaran Outrage!"" feels way out of place since there's no real connecting image or relationship to anything on this page. Plus, the bright yellow makes it a focus on the magazine and hurts the hierarchy of the layout. 

It's like you said, pcjonathan, the real question is how professional this needs to look. It looks great for a project that needs only a passing glance sort of critique, but if this is for a 200+ level college course, it definitely needs some polishing.

Really, Moffat has this terrible habit of one-dimensionalizing women into sexy stereotypes. River went from a mysterious and wise professor from the future to  sexy slinky gun-toting seductively winking high-heel wearing flirt machine. Amy's just there for her looks and even the Widow from The Doctor, The Widow, and the Wardrobe got to weild a gun and use feminine wiles.

The book ranges have been going on for a long time- since the 90s? They are separate from the novelisations, which are book versions of tv stories. The book ranges are thus: Past Doctor Adventures (Doctors 1-7), New Series Adventures (9-11), 8th Doctor Adventures, Missing Adventures, New Adventures (post-end of classic series)..and there might be another.

Needless to say, there are *hundreds* of them. Some are out of print and very expensive to get ahold of (unless you get them off the net...). There's no point in trying to go in order, just jump around. Like all books of anything or episodes of Doctor Who, there are really good stories and really crappy ones. Best to just take recommendations.

The audio dramas are created by the Big Finish company on bigfinish.com (since 1999). It is licensed by the BBC so the stories are part of expanded-Whoniverse continuity (notice I do not use 'canon'). There are many ranges in the Big Finish dramas. The main range is the Monthly Range- every month they spit out 2 dramas (2 hrs per drama) and it goes from Doctors 5-8. There are about 160 monthly dramas. They use all the actual actors for the Doctors and companions (who are less annoying in the dramas).

Then there are the 8th Doctor adventure audio dramas..I think there are 4 seasons of this. It makes Paul McGann the longest Doctor in a manner of speaking.

The 4th Doctor adventures just started because Tom Baker said he would do them.

There's the Bernice Summerfield spin-off series. Bernice is a novel-range companion, greatly loved, like River Song.

There's the Iris Wildthyme spin-off which is like Bernice's.

There's the UNIT spinoff featuring UNIT, whom the Doctor worked with mainly in his 3rd incarnation in the 70s of the show.

There's the Gallifrey spin-off series and I guess it's about Galllifrey and time wars and politics...I've never heard it.

There's the Unbound series which is an alternate continuity what-if mini-series.

There are some Lost stories (narrated?), magazine specials, general specials, and companion chronicles.

There is the Dalek Empire and Sarah Jane spinoff audios which have multiple seasons.

It's all here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_audio_plays_by_Big_Finish#Doctor_Who

As you can imagine, it takes thousands of dollars (USD) and probably years to accumulate these hundreds of dramas. They're expensive as heck. But the stories are totally made for major fans so there's a lot of fan service with high quality. Big villains like Davros or Omega come back, characters are explored... The stories are as awesome as the show itself. Getting used to the audio medium can be tough at first. The main ones are the monthly ones, the 8th Doctor series, and I guess now the 4th Doctor series.

It's pretty overwhelming I know. Do you want recommendations?

From http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-case-dismissed-on-employment-law-reform/8360 :

&gt;OECD indicators of employment protection from 2008 show that the UK has the third least-regulated labour market of all 30 member states surveyed, including most of the world’s leading economies.

http://www.oecd.org/document/11/0,3746,en_2649_37457_42695243_1_1_1_37457,00.html

&gt;Only in America and Canada do employers enjoy a lighter regulatory burden, according to 21 measures of how easy and expensive it is for companies to lay off their staff.

&gt;The European Trade Union Institute says only 33 per cent of the UK workforce are covered by collective bargaining agreements – deals that allow groups like unions to negotiate en masse on wages and working conditions. That’s half the EU average and the smallest percentage in Western Europe.

http://www.worker-participation.eu/National-Industrial-Relations/Across-Europe/Collective-Bargaining2

&gt;The Federation of European Employers, which gives its members detailed information about employment regulations across Europe, concludes: “By continental standards, the UK operates a highly liberal labour market with the minimum of legislative intervention and administrative ‘red tape’.”

I'm not so convinced. It would seem that a significant percentage of them are criminals in their own right. London is the land of the ""bent"" cop. Those that aren't crooked in their own right cover constantly for those who are. 

&gt; They should be engaged with lethal force and killed, and people should know about it. 

That's what I'm saying is counter-productive. It leads to an arms race because the criminals see it as a ""kill or be killed"" scenario. Cops and bystanders bear the brunt of this.

&gt; pulling out a Taser and discharging it into nothing

Depends on the taser. The old-school ones can do that but more modern ones fire prongs into the target then discharge via wires, essentially allowing them to be used at range. They also record every trigger press and AFAIK every discharge requires paperwork and a potential investigation. Some even have cameras on them to record the situation. 

I like billy clubs. They leave bruises which is a fantastic self-limiter in their usage. Tasers are just too ""clean""; it's similar to our preference to use psychological torture on our terror suspects as opposed to techniques that draw blood. It offends us less. 

&gt; having all cops wear head cameras

Definitely agree, but there would need to be strict rules on their usage and access to the data captured. They'll pick up some incredibly personal information in their day to day role, such as on-premises initial interviews with the victims of domestic violence. A sealed unit that cannot be turned off and requires a court order to decrypt the video would be an excellent solution imho.

The thing is, drugs are becoming ever more popular, and there are still some *very* hardline republican elements in Derry (Derry is a far more divided city than most in Northern Ireland. Sectarianism hasn't subsided much, and the things that go along with it, like persistent paramilitarism, continue to have strong influence) which adopt violent reactionary measures.
 It's a sort of perfect storm, as drugs spread like wildfire, and there's a bunch of crazy guys with guns with their own personal vendetta against those involved. 


You're right about the unemployment though. Derry is in a u/e blackspot, which has facilitated the spread of drug dealing, since it's far more lucrative than the shitty First Source jobs which are basically the only ones young people can get, provided you can even get those. If it's a choice between sitting on the dole and going out and making an absolute *fortune* dealing, well, they aren't stupid.

There's also a few secondary schools in Derry which have a history of churning out kids with no GCSEs or even any qualifications to speak of. Tech is filled with kids doing waster courses which are eventually going to land them on the dole, and well, it's a vicious cycle then.

They would test you for depression, and probably assign you to other duties. You'd probably also get in trouble if they figured out you weren't depressed (which doctors are pretty good at).

&gt;Like any job, if you are shit enough then you will be fired.

No. The army doesn't ""fire"" you. They make you clean toilets and do the worst of the worst jobs, and work you like a beast.

&gt; The other thing is why in god anyone would sign an 18 year bastard contract, that's ridiculous, especially if it is difficult to get out of.

Because that's the life they want, or think they want. You act as if soldiers can pick and choose what wars they want to fight. That's not how it works. They're trained for a job and when the country calls upon them to do that job they have to go and do it, whether they feel like it or not.

I love watching re-runs of the 10th Doctors episodes because I just CAN. I can pick up anywhere and watch any episode and have no trouble understanding it, as well as my brother, who has never watched Doctor Who. RTD had some very great, plot heavy episodes as well, but with Moffat it seems much more plot heavy, and the episodes that don't involve that big plot seem much less interesting. With the 11th Doctor you can rarely just jump in and understand it, as you have to have seen everything of season 5 and 6 to even get most the episodes, as they keep this big confusing plot going. I kind of wish it was more like RTD's time, where there was stand-alone episodes. Moffat is an amazing writer, but you're right. Less aliens and terrifying situations and more just plain weird things.

&gt;    Beginning in 1998, the pair voiced adverts for Churchill Insurance. Mortimer providing the voice of the adverts' signature nodding dog, Churchill, and Reeves as the consumer, prompting the dog extol the virtues of insurance deals offered by the company.

&gt;Reeves' contract with Churchill was terminated in March 2005 after he was arrested for a drink-driving offence in which he drove his vintage Jaguar into a stationary vehicle in Boughton Malherbe, near Maidstone before careering into a bank and hitting a fence. For this offence he was disqualified from driving for thirty-six months as of 21 April 2005 and ordered to do 100 hours community service .[8] Reeves' voice-over for the adverts may have been replaced by another voice artist - albeit in the same style - prior to the incident. Mortimer continued to provide the voice for the Churchill dog until at least 2009.[9]

To think this is coming from a government led by a man who said in his first speech as Prime minister: 'I want to make sure that my government always looks after the elderly, the frail, the poorest in our country.'

The reason people don't care is because over the past decade the right wing press have managed to turn 'benefits' into such a dirty word that anyone who receives them, for whatever reason, is an instant scumbag. 

This is why, despite the stacks of horror stories, despite the clear hypocrisy from a government that swore to protect the most vulnerable, despite the destruction of the most non-controversial part of the welfare state: the part that helps those who simply can't. Despite all this, people won't care because the minute they hear the word 'benefits' they loose all empathy, and they don't see the suffering. All they see is a 'scrounger'.

It was written as a reintroduction to the character of the Doctor.

Plotline and enemy may seem silly to your eyes, but don't stop watching it because of that and give the show a chance by watching more than 1 episode. Try to finish at least the first season. 


It's fun, it has brilliant moments and good adventure. It can be light-hearted, yet sometimes emotional. It's a rollercoaster, and you're going to love it.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Okay, let's get an overview. Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans/companions along with him to see alien worlds and history. We've had approximately 784 episodes (32 seasons) but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in nearly anywhere.

The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a you will like. Don't like the eleventh Doctor? Try the tenth! Also, Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 (seasons 1-26) then relaunched in 2005 (seasons 27-32/series 1-6).

But by no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv, then I can give you this guide I wrote...). You should choose the 2005 point.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

And no matter what you do, watch all six series. And if you like them, there's always classic who... :D",0,1335643096,null,0,false,0,c4hpt5g,t3_sx4ki,t1_c4hpt5g,t3_sx4ki,null,1428815667,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

(especially ten-inch and his amazing hair, god I am so jealous of his hair. But I digress) But all the other companions he basically let down easy and made them realize it isn't about him. The doctor was always  ready to let his companion know how brilliant and amazing THEY were. And look what happened with the Doctors help and support. Rose was able to look into the time vortex and literally rewrite time. Donna, admittedly with time lord feedback help, saved the EArth. The doctor even points out that he would never have thought of her plan because he didn't have that Human creative spark. The doctor thinks humans are ""brilliant"" and capable of amazing things.

I'm a fairly fanatical Celtic supporter and I can really understand the unquestioning devotion that a lot of people feel towards players. To a great extent that is the appeal of spectator sports, they provide you with heroes and villains and a nice soap opera to follow along with. But I find it horrifying how that has affected this case and especially the victim. Seeing and reading about the messages of 'support' for Evans and the attempts by United fans to frame him as the victim is really sickening. 

So many people just refuse to accept that someone they've built up as a hero for trivial reasons can be capable of rape - instead they blame the victim. I've seen a few posts on football forums saying that she must be a 'lying bitch' because the first footballer was found innocent and calling her a 'money grubbing whore' (how she could possibly grub any money from this is not clarified).

The reason that it is particularly troubling in this case is that when something like this does happen to a local hero, the consequences of it seep into the public consciousness. The treatment of this victim will play louder in the minds of every Sheffield woman who considers reporting a rape than all the victim centric campaigns money can buy. A huge prescedent has been set here that it is acceptable, and even normal, to blame the victim even if the rapist is convicted.

Furthermore, it will play in the minds of every would be rapist who comes across a girl too drunk to know what's happening. Evans did it and everyone was on his side. This girl deserves what she's going to get. She shouldn't her self into that nick in the first place.

Every Sheffield United supporter involved in this should be ashamed of themselves, and those who know right from wrong should be setting their fellow Blades straight.

Carroll has been struggling, but people seem to forget that he is not 27 years old. He is only 23 years old! Carroll needs some more time to grow before it can be seriously considered to cast him aside. 

I think that the main problem with Downing is that he has been used in the wrong position. Even today, which was one of his better, it has shown that he is not as comfortable on the right side. Also, with a healthy Lucas who can distribute the ball from deep and a constant Gerrard to spread the ball out in the last 1/3, Downing can be of more use. Also, Carroll and Downing go together. Because Carroll isn't heading it in, Downing isn't getting the acclaim he deserves. 

Adam was bought because was able to put the ball in good position from the dead ball. He is a more aggressive attacking midfielder and was good with Blackpool because of their high-tempo play. Liverpool play more of a  possession and cross it in. Adam is a good player and will eventually adapt, but you shouldn't cast him aside after only one season. 

Henderson is only 21! He wasn't even going to be getting that many games this season because we were supposed to have a healthy Lucas and Gerrard, backed up by Adam and Miereles (Who then put in a transfer request to go to Chelsea). Henderson was going to be 5th, but because of injuries, he was pushed to the right and got regular playing time. Give him time to grow as a player. I can guarantee that he will become a star player for Liverpool in years to come. But only if he plays in the midfield.

true,crimsontide091,eccleston,Eccleston,"I'll try to sum up what everyone else has said and then add my personal feelings:

Jack Harkness: His story was always open for return, and RTD did that intentionally. He was meant to come back in ""A Good Man Goes to War"" but Barrowman's filming schedule wouldn't allow it. With the future of Torchwood in the air, Jack could easily slide back in DW. There's so much left to explore with him that fans would love to see. And John Barrowman has stated he'd love to come back to DW if asked.

Rose: Her story is done. We got two years with her, she was ripped from us in a beautifully emotional story, and then we got our happy ending with her and her Doctor. She's also still trapped in the AU so there's not much to be done. Also, in Let's Kill Hitler we did get to see her.

Donna: We got her return in ""The End of Time"" and I think a lot of people were happy with that. But when the Doctor said goodbye he closed off her story. She can also never remember him without fear of dying. We got a glimpse of her in ""Let's Kill Hitler""

Martha: I think she was meant more as a transition from Rose to someone new. Fans were still raw from Rose's departure, I don't think a lot of people would have liked her in a permanent role. We got her return in Journey's End and saw her future a bit in ""The End of Time."" She'd be easy to bring back for a 50th Anniversary Special, but I wouldn't set your hopes too high. Got a glimpse in ""Let's Kill Hitler""

Sarah Jane Smith: We got her beautiful return in ""School Reunion"" something which fans of the Old Series cheered for (as did I). She also got her spin-off and met the 11th Doctor in an episode. Oh so sadly, Elisabeth Sladen passed away, which means no return from her.


Personal feelings: Remembering back on old companions frequently would deter from the current companions. It wouldn't be very interesting to have every other episode be ""Oh I remember when Rose/Martha/Donna/Jack/Sarah/K9/Susan/Adric/Ace/Romana did something similar!"" It would get really old really fast.

Like stated before, the Doctor is a new man now. He has a different personality and different feelings. The switch from 9 to 10 was really a transition but kept the same series. Since 11, we've had new everything: new companions, new adventures, new TARDIS, new TARDIS interior. It's not just a superficial change, it represents 11's change to a new man.

That's why we'll likely never see the old companions in a regular episode anymore. However, the 50th Anniversary will allow the possibility of anyone returning (I personally want 9 to come back).",0,1335650108,null,0,false,0,c4hr29w,t3_sv2l7,t1_c4hr29w,t3_sv2l7,null,1428816316,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

My guess - you can refuse if it's not in your contract, but you'll get the ""must have something to hide"" reaction. For some jobs, it's in the contract anyway.

I read a story about a train driver who was fired after a drug test maybe 10 years ago. Eventually, he proved in court that the result was a false positive, caused by Neurofen Plus rather than heroin (due to a metabolite of codeine, I think). Trouble is, he wasn't given a chance to defend himself immediately after the test - he was just fired.

Apparently, ibuprofen is also known to cause cannabis test false positives, and there's loads of other common causes of drugs test false positives.

Based on other stories (I'm sure your Google-fu is as strong as mine) being fired due to a false positive used to be a fairly common thing, but court cases forced people to take note. Now, you should get a questionaire asking you declare anything you've taken that's likely to cause a false positive.

Of course a false positive can happen for no easily traceable reason - you just have to hope that's rare and won't affect you.",0,1335653745,null,0,true,0,c4hro50,t3_sxbd2,t1_c4hro50,t3_sxbd2,null,1428816606,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

First off, the classic Doctors mostly have serials which are not and were never designed to be viewed in a marathon.

The classic serials don't have the proper introduction, rising action, climax, conclusion. They just have rising action and then a cliffhanger that starts off the next part, so watching them all in one go is a bumpy and difficult to enjoy ride.

Episodes like The War Games or Earthshock are brilliant Classic Who episodes, but their full weight can only be appreciated after having already watched the show in proper order.

There is actually a guide to watching Classic Who along with great starting points in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bYEn0E6iC8).

Probably The Aztecs for 1 because it's a good length and has the Doctor being nicer

Mind Robber for 2 (easy since he has few surviving stories)

Spearhead from Space or Planet of the Spiders for 3, probably Spearhead since your friend hasn't seen any

Genesis of the Daleks, Face of Evil, Robots of Death for 4 but I'll go Genesis because Daleks make the story accessible and it's a true classic (it's how I got into classic Who after many failed tries)

5's is Caves of Androzani easy but Mawdryn Undead or Kinda might be better for your friend

6's is Vengeance on Varos hands down

true,Eddie_Hitler,cnty-uk,Scotsman in East Anglia,"I think this case (no pun intended) is quite straightforward.  

My belief is that he had a secret lover with ""similar inclinations"" you could say, who was also in the intelligence services.  That person is responsible for his death and the cover-up is because exposing identities or linking them to certain ""lifestyles"" is considered a) potentially scandalous and b) a threat to national security.  The snowball has more chance in hell than something like this reaching the courts, the police have been had and they know it fine well.

He was known to be hugely paranoid and only a tiny list of carefully selected people were allowed into the flat, making it likely that it was someone he knew seeing as there were no signs of a break-in or struggle.  I personally don't buy any theory about a break-in/struggle being tidied up and the damage repaired, because someone would have heard or seen *something* and these witnesses would have to be kept quiet somehow.  Not easy.

Leaving the bag in a forensically cleaned bath with no DNA or fingerprints present at all (not even Gareth's own) is sufficiently bizarre that it'll keep Joe and Jane Public gossiping for years to come; also, removing the body would be too risky and difficult given the type of building he lived in.  It also fits his purported lifestyle and ""being into that sort of thing"" so wouldn't seem too offbeat for him as a person bearing in mind he was openly gay, they found all the womens' clothing and he had previously had to be rescued by his landlady in Cheltenham after being found naked tied to his bed with his excuse being ""I wanted to see if I could get free"".

In one of the late episodes of season 6 (possibly ""The Wedding of River Song"") he says something about helping young Rose with her homework or going to all of Jack's stag parties and he even tris to call Brigadier but we wouldn't see that in the show because really, nobody will be interested in an episode in which nothing happens.

The actors aren't signed to the show anymore and I am sure there are schedule issues for many of them (which is why Captain Jack didn't appear in ""A Good Man Goes to War"" according to Moffat) so unless there is a really important reason for them to be in the show it is too much effort for everyone.

true,Philomathematic,hartnell,Hartnell,"It sounds like an interesting idea, but also a bit Star Trek in the ensemble casting. The more main characters that you have, the more side plots and so on you'll also have going on. Doctor Who has about 13 episodes on average, and while Moffat has stated that the next series won't be as arc-driven as series 6, you'd still want to be able to tie plots and events together in a neat enough way.

It depends, I suppose, on your take on [this](http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-19/steven-moffat-the-companion-is-the-main-character-in-doctor-who,-not-the-doctor) statement. Moffat believes that the companions are the real main characters, and this is seen in the emphasis placed on Amy and Rory's story as well as lines from the Doctor such as ""In the end, my friends have always been the best of me."" Personally, I think that not subordinating the companions to the Doctor is a Good Thing, but let's not also forget that their main purpose is still to be an audience surrogate of some sort. They ask the questions and express the emotions that we would, and the Doctor grows as a character in response to his companions.

Having a non-human companion would be the ultimate extension of Moffat's argument, in my opinion. Let's assume that at least half of the stories in such a hypothetical series featuring an alien companion would still deal with Earth and human history/nature (because we can't throw out all the audience surrogate). In this case, then, the non-human companion is constantly asking for explanation of humany-wumany bits, and the Doctor's role becomes not so much to shed light on the aliens, but on humanity.

This would be an interesting change. We've already seen the Eleventh Doctor being a much more alien figure than Ten (and other regenerations as well), but also possessing great insight into human nature (""Because what's the point in them being happy now if they're going to be sad later? The answer is, of course, because they're going to be sad later.""). And what I took away from the latest Christmas special was that the Doctor is realizing just how inescapably human he can be. (As a shameless plug, see [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/rekod/i_always_think_of_the_doctor_bizarrely_as_the/) and my response for more on the Doctor's humanity) So to have a companion who requires the Doctor to be more human than he is would be a very interesting move. And if handled correctly, it could be a fantastic series.

But it could also go terribly wrong. The danger in having a non-human companion is once again isolating the audience in terms of what the characters know versus what the audience knows/needs to know. Going back to the Star Trek image, the range of characters and views among the crew of the Enterprise (or DS9, or Voyager, if you prefer) is interesting, but always grounded in an ultimately human perspective, usually from the captain. The morality and lessons imparted have to still hold relevance to humanity's betterment, otherwise Doctor Who risks becoming weirdly existentialist, I suspect.",0,1335675729,null,0,false,0,c4hv9ou,t3_sxo39,t1_c4hv9ou,t1_c4huhis,null,1428818298,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

I'd like to see what McGann would do with a script that didn't suck, but I'd rather see him in the 50th anniversary special. Haven't finished the article yet because the writer lost me at ""the somewhat timid Christopher Ecclestone"", and I'm wondering if he's even SEEN the Ninth Doctor. 

Edit, now that I'm finished with the article: Okay, whoever wrote this is a bleedin' idiot. They can't spell worth a damn, and apparently can't even run their crap through a spell check. Also, his understanding of the Doctor seems shallow and stupid. Not every Doctor has been ""easily excitable"". McCoy was quite the opposite. Doesn't like one candidate because he's ""too physically big and intimidating"". Has he ever seen Tom Baker? And the final dollop of stupid icing on the cake is his claim that Johnny Depp at 48 is ""too old for the part"". *facepalm* 

I think it's really stupid for anyone other than the regular show runner and crew to do a movie. Much as I adore Paul McGann (he's one of my favorite three Doctors), the 1996 movie really was kind of awful. I don't trust the concept in other hands.

true,DeusJZ,tardis,TARDIS,"I didn't document it as I went along, but I did already type some out. I'll put them here: 

First, you'll require the Sonic screwdriver itself. I got mine from goHastings (lowest combined price with shipping) **[here](http://www.gohastings.com/catalog/product.jsp?departmentName=TRENDS&amp;sku=282429406)**.

I also had two Capacitive Touch Styluses laying around that I had bought on ebay for a cheap price a while back. **[This](http://www.ebay.com/itm/10x-Universal-Capacitive-Stylus-Touch-Screen-Pen-For-Tablet-PC-i-Pad-Smart-Phone-/110853918238?pt=US_Tablet_Accessories&amp;hash=item19cf688e1e)** is a pretty low cost example of what I got. 

So, when it came in, the flashlight itself is actually really good for a single LED, insanely bright. But it seemed lacking, so knowing that the bottom of the casing was hollow, I tool a drill and made a small hole slightly smaller than the end itself, and after sanding the casing to make it smooth, I checked the size, and it was a pretty snug fit for the end of the stylus I had chopped up. 

THIS IS WHERE I WENT WRONG. 

The stylus is built to be cheap, and gains the capacitive power through the metal tubing as a conduit. Attaching it to plastic rendered it useless, and I didn't test it before gluing. However, using a series of small, metal wires, I connected the stylus to the battery receiver and batteries themselves to gain some power. This has worked for me so far. 

SOLUTION:

Attach the stylus to the battery receiver/batteries before securing the stylus in the hole, Test and confirm before securing.

After that, it was pretty easy. I left a bit of the metal tubing exposed, and when it hasn't worked, I took some more of the wire, wrapped it around the metal at the end (secured via electrical tape) and wrapped the rest around a valley in the design so I could still get the capacitive power without sacrificing the design for use.

Overall, low cost, easy, and really freaking cool. Nice DIY project that doesn't take too much skill or time.",0,1335680661,null,0,false,0,c4hvzaz,t3_sxbz0,t1_c4hvzaz,t1_c4hvnqo,null,1428818638,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I'll be at Oxford from June 20something till August 20something for an 8-week study abroad.

When I lived in Oxford (sometime before I was a student there) I used to work at The Turf, which is a popular pub. Summer was my favourite time, because the place used to fill up with American students abroad for the summer, and the American girls were uniformly hotter and easier than the natives. One summer (2004?) this girl I was dating in Oxford got pretty involved, and ended up inviting me out to see her in X, where I attended her sorority ball. Also there was a girl I'd been seeing in London who'd been on the same program. Awkward!

This brings us to the first two points:

a) London is pretty close to Oxford, so discover the Oxford Tube nice and early, realize it runs literally all through the night so you can have an adhoc night clubbing in London, and make use of it liberally, as Oxford's nightlife during the Summer months is mostly dead.

b) The Turf is a lovely pub in the summer, and not as dead or chavvy as most other drinking spots in the summer when the students aren't there. Also consider The Purple Turtle, which is a little sketchy, but will likely have studenty types in it.

&gt; Any secret Oxford labyrinths or passageways to explore?

Walk down George Street, all the way. Turn left at the bottom. Turn left again as soon as you can on to what looks like a drive way and the back-end of all the restaurants. Keep walking for about 40 metres and ... secret passageway! You'll come out about 500m away near the Castle.

This is itching at the back of my head: 
Surely there's some significant legal issue with deploying military hardware in and on a heavily populated civilian area, especially since isn't the UK 'At War' or involved in 'Peacekeeping' activities?

Have any of the businesses or organizations within range of this system been advised? I don't mean just the ""Oh, we're deploying this."" in the news. I mean have they received notice and information on who to contact if they have any concerns?

How long will it take to get any recompense for any damage,failure or use/misuse of the weapons systems? Bear in mind, people are still fighting for money from the London Riots..

I'm not sure if I support Bayern. If it was Real who'd gotten through I would have cheered them on, but now it's Bayern ... with the foul-playing Germans ... and the grand cheater Neuer. I don't want him to lift the cup, it would be soiled/tainted for a few years. (And I certainly do not want to see him in this wonderful club.)

Ideally we'd be 3rd by the finals, so I could hope for Chelsea to win - since the wankers managed to get through to the finals... Also, that would probably knock-out Arsenal, and we could all have a good laugh. Even so, I think it's a stupid rule.

Come the day and we're 4th, I'm not sure who I'd want to win. Do I want Bayern to win and us to (maybe) play in a ""tainted"" competition (even if it's the best in the world), or do I want Chelsea to win and take our spot and maybe give us some ""breathing space""? I do recognise that this will make us lose a lot of money (compared to if we'd managed to qualify).

Bottom line is, maybe I believe in Karma too much. But I know that I'm physically/mentally unable to hope that Bayern will win, and that I'm at the same time are able to hope that Chelsea will lose.

true,Redtom,lfc68,,"These predictions are poor. Here's my thinking...

Kuyt - As we all know Liverpools under some major reconstruction at the minute and with the massive interest Feyenord are showing and Kuyt love for the club this is something that could happen, but Kuyt is a major goal scorer for us, by this I mean he gets the goals when there needed. Hes also a fan fav so it'll be hard tos ee him go, personally I think it'll be his own decision not the clubs but if he were to go the club would probably try to get a decent deal for him 2 Million isn't much but he is getting on a bit, I'd say more like 5 Million but to Feyenord he'll be priceless for them, although I'll be sad to see him go I'm happy that its to Feyenord. 

Carragher - Hes getting on ALOT and has struggled at times this season but I think he's getting allot more stick then he deservers and I think he would be able to manage another season on the bench to bring that experience to the team, but retiring isn't something I'd wouldn't say no to he'll probably take an assistant manger type role at the club if he were to retire. 

Jonjo - Hes shown alot of ablitly and will be a crucial player for us next year especially being in Europe, I think he'll be staying up.

Aquilani - Has been rejected repeatedly by Italian clubs 3 Million maybe, my guess is he'll come back everyone will moan, he'll be amazing in pre-season then we'll actually sell him this time but for under 5 Mill and then regret doing so straight away. I would prefer we give him one last season playing for Liverpool before we decide to sell after the last 2 years away. 

Cole - Lille, he's said he'll except a massive pay cut to stay. 

Johnson - I don't see him going anywhere

Robinson - Hes what? 17? 18 next season? Hes not going on loan too far from Liverpool, Blackpool maybe? If they don't get promoted. 

Wisdom - You could be right with this one a Championship club would snap him up on a loan right away and it would help him grow, I think this would be the best idea for him. 

Maxi - Hes a hard one to predict, every season he isn't played, then he pops out at the end and scores a bunch, imagine if we played him more? I love him and don't want to see him go but I think he'll want to leave because Liverpool arn't going anywhere fast and he's barely getting game time. 

Aurelio - Out

All new players will be staying, especially Adam everyone who hates on him can shove it he has played decently and with Lucas back he'll be even better. yeah he looks about 80 but the guys 25, he's not pasted it just yet. Hes created allot of chances for us, if those went in instead of hit the post everyone would be chanting his name. 

I can't help but live in fear knowing there's a good chance Kuyt, Carragher and Maxi wont be here next season, there the back bone of Liverpool :'( I know Maxi hasn't been about long but he has a special place in my heart at Liverpool would hate to see theses guys off the team sheet.

true,MooMorris,null,null,"There's little debate that Labour will make gains and the Lib Dems will concede seats. How much will the gain be could be over- emphasised  by this article. The polls may say Labour have a big lead, but how much of this is due to them being popular? I suspect I'm not alone in thinking it's because of the unpopular coalition. This does not mean that they will gain- opinions and votes are very different.

Every party has partisan voters, who vote for them no matter what. The turnout of these will be key. There are fewer now than at any other time since the 1950's, but there are enough to make a difference at local governance level. Simplicity of the situation is that no party has done enough to win over the non aligned voter.

Right now there I wouldn't say there's a state of apathy, because that implies that people don't care. People do care, but the options right now are crap so see no reason to vote. 'Single issue' party's, like the Pirate party, could benefit, especially from protest votes (which has previously seen the Lib Dems gain).

My prediction is that Labour will make limited gains, almost entirely from the Lib Dems. The Tories will stay where they are, and smaller parties/ independents will rise. Turnout will be one of, if not the lowest ever recorded in the UK.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"I don't really agree with Moffat's stance. Not only with his comparison of the Doctor and Sherlock (as saying Sherlock is a human trying to be a god is a predictable misinterpretation of the character) but of his overall stance of saying the companions are the focus of Doctor Who.

I think that saying Doctor Who isn't about the Doctor is like saying Sherlock Holmes adventures are about Watson or that Star Wars is about the droids. Just because they're the perspective we see the story through does not mean that they are our subject of study.

We may see it from different angles, but the Doctor is the major focus of the show. His actions are not only what drive the plot and build the story, but his personality is the one that always stand out of the entire cast.

I think that the companions should have their own lives and be independent people (like many of the other companions before Amy), butt should not be the show's major focus. Because quite frankly the show simply doesn't lend itself for them to be the center in an enjoyable way.

Additionally, the show has lingered about on Earth for far too long in many people's opinions. We already see the Doctor react to humans, seeing another alien on top of that reacting to humans quickly makes the show entirely preoccupied with superficially connecting itself to humanity instead of actively taking the human perspective.

I don't really think it would be too interesting. The Doctor has already done great commentary on the human race. To have that become a major point of structure and support rather than a splendid addition threatens to oversaturate the show with fauxlisophical musings and thus make them wholly meaningless.

Part of most of the non-human dynamics in Star Trek hinge on their being a human perspective to work off of. Data's analysis and attempted emulation of human behavior would have no meaning if there was no Geordi to guide him.

Maybe i'm missing something, but the great managers seem to have a great grasp of both man-management and tactics.

Since we all know that Harry doesn't know the difference between tactics and ""fucking run around a bit."" let's deal with the man-managing bit.

Harry (or at least the media) fancies himself a great motivator and man-manager, but from what i've seen he's really not that great. VdV has expressed that he doesn't feel he's well used out on the wing, and we can all agree that Bale is ill used when he plays centrally. In addition, he doesn't seem to comprehend that Ledley can't play week in, week out. Moreover, he doesn't seem to really understand where and when to play certain formations; walking into Everton with a heavily defensive lineup, or playing Sandro, Parker, Modric, and VdV against QPR. Kyle Walker is a good player going forward, and serviceable in defense, but he isn't the type of player that you can simply let the other team run at all day. The same is true of BAE; good defensively, but you can't let people run at him all day. Yet play Bale and VdV out wide, and telling bale to drift in, completely ruins any chance of giving them consistent cover.

Bottom line; If we make the Champs league, it won't be because of Harry. He's a good coach, but we need a great coach who can help take us over the top. I'm not sure who that is now (I wanted Martin O'Neill, but he's off the table) but maybe Pep Guardiola, or AVB. Who knows.

You should be fine but Kent is big. Some of Kent is near London and good for a night out, some isn't. Some bits of Kent have a larger ratio of racist dickheads than others, ymmv.

&gt; Where are the best places to meet new people ?

The easiest way is to look for local groups that match your interest and expand from there.

&gt; What does a night out on the town usually entail ? 

It varies but most often overpriced drinks with friends, some bad food and an expensive cab ride home.

&gt; What are the things I just shouldn't pass up ?

There's some good shopping in bits of Kent. Head to London and do the tourist stuff if you can. Brighton's also good for a day out if the weather's nice.

&gt; In short..what do I need to know about living in England ?

Start with your family circle, ease yourself in slowly and try to build up a support network of good people you get on well with, not people you're just friends with for the sake of being around people.

It depends if you live inside Greater London or not. The further out it is, the more hassle it is getting home after a night on the town. Journeys from Zone 1-3 at the end of the night are fine, but Zone 6 or further out - forget it, you might as well go out where you are, unless you have somewhere to crash for the night closer into town. And if you live south of the river, like I do, it automatically makes everything more difficult. 

This is a consequence of our shit transport system, which can't cope with running later than 12am.

Yes, this news story broke because people got leaflets through their doors, iirc.

Work hard to find decent food, its definitely worth it. England has a lot of excellent cuisine, but it can be hard work to find it when compared to other nations, cause most English people enjoy consuming total shit. The fresh fish in Kent is superb.

You will meet arseholes that will make you question living in the UK. For sheer aggressive rudeness, Brits can be bad. Ignore them and remember that they are unrepresentative of the majority, who are welcoming and friendly.

In short, England is not a nation that is immediate, if that makes sense. The weather isn't great, a lot of the towns are not exactly eye-pleasing and its very easy to become insular.

true,tastymoonpie,kernow,loves Cornwall,"Depending on where exactly in Watford you'll be, you should have pretty good access to London, if you are interested in city life.  If you are near Watford Junction, you can catch a fast train into Euston station (central London) and be there in about 20 minutes.  There's a shopping centre on the High Street called the Harlequin which is a handy thing to have nearby, as well as a decent selection of restaurants and shops on the High Street itself (although, like in a lot of places, some have shut down and haven't been replaced by any new businesses, which is kind of depressing).  A few stops down the Overground line from the Watford stops is Hatch End, which has loads of restaurants and shops just a 2-minute walk from the station.  

That's not really 'OMG you can't miss this!' info, but maybe it's still helpful to you.  I'm a foreigner myself (from America) and have been living in England for 4 1/2 years, and in the Watford area for 3 1/2.  It's alright, pretty good.  I don't really like city life, and so am paying lots for my close proximity to London, but it's where I found a good job, so I'm here for the time being. 

It's nice that it's not too far to rolling hills and pretty countryside, although having a car to access anything in the opposite direction of London is much easier than trying to use public transportation.  Buses and trains are great for getting into London &amp; back again, but taking the train around the country has gotten insanely expensive and taking the bus, although much cheaper, takes a lot of time.  If you're planning on buying a car here, be aware that there are lots of charges, like a yearly road tax, high insurance costs, very high petrol costs, congestion charges in the city, etc.  Also, many roads are overcrowded and so traffic can be slightly nightmarish.  

Don't get me wrong; it's a beautiful country filled with amazing history, gorgeous scenery and the occasional friendly stranger. ;)  It's a great place to live, but the realities are quite different from romanticized fairy tale some people expect.  Just so long as you know what sort of things to expect, you will hopefully have a wonderful experience here. :)

true,Yaverland,english,London,"English people make a hobby out of attacking their own country. Basically every conversation on every topic revolves around how something is terrible, terrible, probably the worst thing ever - apart from everything else, of course. Unless we are talking to people from other European countries or Americans, whereupon we become fiercely proud, particularly of our own history. In our minds, WWII only finished last week, and Churchill personally stormed the Reichstag with two hands tied behind his back. 

In terms of going out, it varies massively from place to place. Explore the area close to you, you might find something that isn't crap. But if you want to head to central London, there's more to do than I could possibly describe. I couldn't give you a single answer as to what a night out looks like. There is a big Caribbean community (especially round Brixton, where I live) so plenty of venues catering to their tastes, but there is loads else. 

Licensing rules have become more flexible in recent years. Generally pubs close at 11, bars at around 12-1, and clubs as late as they can manage (2am or later). It does start to become difficult to get a reasonably priced drink from 11 onwards, or find somewhere that is still open. Make sure you have planned your night or you'll end up wandering around. Never go into a random club that you haven't planned on being in - it is probably overpriced and shit. I've heard of people going into London for nights out and staying in hostels, but I'd say most just stay up all night and get the first train the next morning. Don't bring a chainsaw. Do make sure you have a number for a licensed cab company

Seems that time prior to the war would be accessible... Also the matter of personal timeline. What if the very first time lord to go on a TARDIS ride came to 2012? I should still be able to a few minutes after I left. The Doctor can't go back because of the crossing his own timeline thing... and in a major way.

true,Dystopian_Satire,null,null,"Although I can't directly answer your question I can provide some information that might help your decision. I also have the unique perspective of being an american studying at University of Kent and went through the same process as you a year ago, applying to a uni in the UK and having a lot of questions. Sorry for the wall of text but things will better explained this way.

Firstly the uni provides accommodation for foundation, stage 1, post-grad, and those on exchange programs. They may also provide it for transfer students who are second or third stage but first year at the uni, I'm not really sure about this or if it even applies to you. This means that any student in stages 2 and 3 are living off campus in flats which I guess would mean the majority of the student body isn't living on the campus. 

As for the on-campus accommodations there are a few options. You might have to check with the accommodation office but I think international students are given priority for accommodation. I think this means an en-suite room, which is a single occupant room with a personal bathroom including sink, toilet and shower. I would advise sending an email to the accommodation office to verify this though. The accommodations are situated into flats of several people, I have 8 in mine including myself. To my knowledge none of the rooms on campus are dual occupancy, ie a room-mate. You can get a double bed if you choose the right place, New Keynes. Now, it should be understand that just like you don't get a pick of your roommate in colleges/uni's in the US you don't get to choose your flatmates. I think their testing an extended accommodation application that let's you input preferences, like living habits(quiet,noisy,party-types),music, etc... However this probably won't change the relationships between the flatmates. You may end up with a nice quiet flat, noisy flat, or somewhere in between. It really depends on the dynamics of the people living in the flat. There is a thread about the UoK accommodations in this subreddit that was posting very recently. Give it a read, it will give a lot of information on the various accommodation options and social atmospheres.

The social atmosphere is essentially what you make it and is not that different from an american campus. The accommodations are split up into blocks with separate flats in each of the blocks, depending on where you are. The layouts are different in each place. So there isn't dorms or halls as they are known in the states, like 30 rooms to each floor in a hall. You may get along with your flatmates or you may not. You can meet people in your program. Lectures aren't 500 students large. Probably no more than 150 max. If you have seminars, essentially small discussion groups, that can provide some socializing options. There are also a ton of clubs, extra-curricular activities you can get involved in, which is where a lot of people can meet and socialize over some common subject. There is a lot of socializing the in the on-campus bars and club as well, meeting friends of friends and such. There are quite a few bars/pubs in the centre where a lot of the later stage students hang out. But I think you'll be much better off staying on campus for the first year. Socializing will be probably be a lot easier. Also the centre is only like a 20 minute walk from campus or about a 5 min bus ride, you can do quite a bit of exploring during your first year without any trouble.

The public transport in and around Canterbury is facilitated mostly by bus and is very good. There are a few lines that run to/through the campus quite frequently during the day something like one every 10 minutes or so, less often during non-term times. So commuting really shouldn't be much of a problem. Like I said earlier most students live off-campus so they are all commuting as well. Might even be able to walk most days if you get a flat closer to the uni. There are quite a few houses/flats situated between the campus and town. If you end up going for the flat I suggest to start searching soon. Many of the students finishing up their stage 1 are signing leases around now. I'm not sure what rent will be like for a two person flat or if you'll even be able to find many of that type. Most students go 3 person and up when renting. Getting a flat may end up being cheaper, money wise, compared to options on-campus, depending on what you get. This will be the case for me based on what I pay now for my accommodation and the bitch of an exchange rate. So I suggest doing some research. There might be a list of rental agencies under the off-campus accommodation section of the Accommodation page on the kent website. 

As the other replies have said Canterbury is a pretty safe place and quite pleasant. The ""campus police"" thing is funny. There is campus watch that kind of monitors the campus, checks on things but isn't really ""police"" as you put it. You'll be safe wherever you end up. I would personally recommend staying on-campus for your first year. You'll definitely meet more people this way and will able to build a solid social sphere. But it is your decision. Hopefully the wall of text wasn't too daunting and it helped make some things clear.

true,hdruk,cnty-expat,Expat,"&gt;Surely there's some significant legal issue with deploying military hardware in and on a heavily populated civilian area, especially since isn't the UK 'At War' or involved in 'Peacekeeping' activities?

I'd hope not. The Ministry of Defence and the various military branches should be able to deploy the assests that they own specifically to defend the UK where they are required.

Think about the alternatives for a bit. Say the missiles are positioned away from any areas of high population density. Because of the size of London they would have to be a ridiculous distance from the events, and any matching restricted flying area would have to be even bigger so that the defenses could be used if necessary, probably to a size where all the major airports in the region would be affected. It may also be that over such a large area the defense coverage would not be adequate.

Realisitically the missiles have to be deployed, as from 9/11 we know the worst case senario exists. We can't have knowledge of all possible threats in advance no matter how good intel is, so precautions like this have to be taken.

And at the end of the day, if they have to be used, chunks of destroyed plane hitting residential housing will cause less casualties than a direct hit on any of the venues when they're full during the olympics...

true,Grumpasaurussss,null,null,"I would personally live on campus for your first year, mainly as you will make more friends doing this. The vast majority of first years will be living on campus, so if you do join any societies or want to go out with your friends, it will mainly be done on campus (there are plenty of bars and a nightclub on campus) and they will probably stay there until closing, dragging themselves back to their rooms. I have found that since I moved from campus  I haven't been active in societies at all or anything like that as it's just too much effort to get up on to the campus at that time of night.

If you are set on living off campus, however, the main student area for UKC students is called Hales Place.... however I think the majority of students wanting private student accommodation for the next academic year signed contracts back in december. But you never know, there may still be some around. If you don't want to be completely surrounded by students, I would suggest the London Road Estate. This is where I lived in my second and third years at uni and its quite nice, although there is a secondary school in the area so there are annoying teenagers.

Money-wise, living on campus is probably going to be the most expensive option (depending on what you go for). Off campus, if you want a student letting then expect to pay more than £400 a month in a house share. If you want a non-student private letting, then you can't really get anything for less than £550 for the very smallest studio flat (ie, one room and a bathroom); no less than £600 for a one bed flat etc etc etc

Also, the university have a deal with the local bus company stagecoach where you can get a year bus ticket for not very much (I think it was £150 when I got one a few years ago, but it might have gone up). This is very useful if you live off campus so you don't have to walk up a huge hill every day! It also allows you to travel anywhere in Kent, I think...

Just to make it clearer, in Canterbury there are private companies which let houses out only to students, and this is what I mean when I talk about off campus student lets. They will range from 3 to 10 rooms in house shares, and this is generally what people do in their second and third years. The prices for these will be for the individual room, while for non-student lets the price will be for the entire flat/house. Just for you to keep in mind!

So basically, I think it's best to stay on campus for your first year. You will feel much more alone off campus, and remember - nobody will no anyone at first! It doesn't matter whether you're an international student or not, everyone is friendly to everyone else, because no one knows anyone.

Edit: Outside of being a dick about it, I do agree that there's a serious issue with chains taking over the high street. IMO it is simply because it is too expensive and difficult for individuals to set up their own stores. Rents keep on going higher, even as the relevance and profitability of town centres decreases. The legal system around rents is actually pretty mad, someone looking to set up a shop has to sign a lease for 5 or 10 years, and they have to submit to regular reviews of the rental cost relative to market/neighbourhood prices, and those reviews can only ever make the price go up, and not down.

The other thing is the direction the country is heading in terms of science and technology, we have one of the lowest investment in science among the major developed economies. 

We can't seem to make a high knowledge and high tech economy work. We were once second only to the US and Japan when it came to video game development but we are slowly being outdone by the rest of the world and it seems to be the same story across the board.

We can't seem to come up with our equivalent of Skype, Microsoft or other high tech stuff, what we do have is still very small and if the past is any indication it won't go very far. I'm not saying we're devoid of these things but given our history we should be a bigger part of it.

true,Dystopian_Satire,null,null,"You should check out the [accommodation](http://www.kent.ac.uk/accommodation/) section. Look under on-campus or undergrad accommodation. 

There are a few different options depending on how you want to be accommodated. Also I have no idea how they assign accommodation, it may be first come first serve or something. You fill out an application input your top three choices. You need to decide whether you want 39 week or 31 week housing. 39 weeks is the full school year. 31 accommodation means having to fully move out of your room during winter and easter breaks, each about a month long. Next, there are catered accommodations, or self-catered. 31 weeks usually has the catering options, I'm not versed in these options as I'm self-catered. I think breakfast and dinner are included in the accommodation pricing and are taken at one of the restaurants/eating places on campus. Self-catered means no meal plan, you have to prepare your own meals. There are a few restaurant type places on campus that you can eat at. There is also a small store on campus that has food and the essentials for living on your own. You can also hit tescos or asda in town for food, these are local grocery stores. 

Check out the accommodation prices page. It shows which places have the large en-suite rooms. I can only vouch for the Keynes flats because that's where I am and know that the large rooms have a double bed, I don't know if this also goes for the large rooms in the other colleges. Keynes Flats are brand new, we are the first occupants. They are 8 people to a flat, with a nice and decent sized kitchen. From what I've heard the students who are able to stay on campus again are pulling for the large en-suite rooms. You will pay more for the large rooms and even more if it's in Keynes flats.

As for the best accommodation, that's matter of opinion and varies depending on who you talk to. I have really enjoyed living in New Keynes(Keynes Flats) and everyone I've talked has found them to be great or are a bit jealous. Give this thread a read [Kent Uni Halls](http://www.reddit.com/r/canterbury/comments/sk2wz/kent_uni_halls/). It gives some opinions of the various places on campus. Some places have shared kitchens and bathrooms. Some of the catered places don't have kitchens.

So I guess it all comes down to 39/31 weeks, catered/self-catered, room size, and pricing. Be wary of the exchange rate if you have to move money. You probably have to exchange at something higher than the market value so watch out.

It's not lunch time and it's not very cold either.... and then a week later the same section of road is opened up for something else.

I noticed this. They put in a new sidewalk where I lived, and it took months to do about 400m each side of the street because they had a team of about 6 people who worked only half the day. So I asked my councilor about it, and the reason it was like this is because it was the cheapest bid, and because it was a sidewalk, not a street the level of disruption was considered to be minimal even though they did things like move the bus stop to a point nowhere near a crossing (meaning you had to jump out in front of traffic to get to it). Then there was the issue of different teams having to do different things (gas piping, laying the sidewalk, installing the bus stops, doing the signs etc), and none of the scheduled matched up for these firms. So they would literally have days of the builders just turning up and waiting for another team.

I don't want a manager at the club who would sacrifice our season so carelessly. I get that modern football is dominated by pay cheques but there are other managers out there with a bit more fucking integrity, surely? Moyes? O'Neill? Hate to say it, but while Wenger might be a prick in countless other ways he has a vision and he sticks to it. Let's find someone who is going to build a legacy, someone who is out for the good of the club, not just themselves. 

I don't usually jump on a bandwagon, and I'm not a knee jerk Spurs supporter, but at this point I say Fuck Harry. He sounds good but come to the crunch he doesn't have our backs.

Sometimes it makes the overall cost cheaper than shipping something to the UK even. It's quite a lovely surprise.

However, I currently get my jerseys from [here](http://www.footballkitstore.com/). They may certainly be fakes, however the company is in Taiwan, where most jerseys are made, so they may be factory direct as well or factory rejects. Either way, I've ordered about 3 jerseys from this store (with two more on the way now) and I CANNOT tell the difference between the ones ordered here and official ones ordered from Kitbag. They also offer champions league number printing and badges right now as well so you can turn your jersey into a champions league one. I think my current order was two jerseys, personalized, badges, shipped...under $65. It's hard for me to pass that up, even if they are (really good) fakes.

I agree with your assessment, but you can't just ignore the impact of what happened in February. It's happened time and again when a manager says he is ready to leave and the squad just starts phoning it in. The impact is going to be especially pronounced when you're dealing with as a man manager like Redknapp. It's naive to think it has no impact on the squad.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"**The Ninth Doctor**

Dalek (Brilliant. The first story in a *long* time to make the Daleks frightening again. Really powerful stuff)

The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances (What's there to say? A classic.)

Bad Wolf/Parting of the Ways (This shows a very one-sided battle against the Daleks. You really get the feeling that *anyone* could die, something I fear Doctor Who has lost)

Boom Town (This episode gets a bad wrap for including Blom, but the tense moments of her being captive and the questioning of the Doctor's constant running from consequences makes this the episode that asks questions that I wish were further explored.)

The Unquiet Dead ( The actor playing Dickens carries the episode beautifully. The back and forths with the Doctor and him really crackle, and who can't resist a ""Happy medium"" pun?)


**The Tenth Doctor**

Blink (That one speecch the Doctor gives carefully carries the entire episode. Without it, the Angels aren't scary at all.)

Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead (One of Ten's best. What can I say? The Doctor manages to pull the ""I'm the doctor, basically run"" card for the first time and unlike later uses, it doesn't feel like a cheap ""get out of danger free"" card.)

Girl in the Fireplace (From a genuinely creepy villain to a deeply emotional insight to the Doctor's powerful but fleeting effect on those he meets, this is clearly in the Top Five for Ten.)

Human Nature/Family of Blood (Villains that manage camp *and* fear mixed with another interesting question: is being the Doctor the right choice?)

Midnight (Perfect suspense, perfect use of ""less is more"". I wish other episodes of Who would take note of this episode's careful pacing and use of psychology to form a landscape of panic and tight-knit fear.)

**The Eleventh Doctor**

A Christmas Carol (Captures the Christmas magic of Dicken's tale while simultaneously being something completely original. Everything about this episode was magically superb. Easily the best Who Special yet.)

The Doctor's Wife (From seeing more of the Doctor/TARDIS relationship, to some genuinely creepy moments with HOUSE, this episode's writing just knocks it out of the bleeding park.)

Closing Time (This episode succeeded in everything it attempted. It was honestly silly, genuinely heartwarming, and a downright hilarious adventure that gives wonderful nods to Classic Who without beating you over the head with it.)

The Eleventh Hour (Easily the best Doctor introduction yet. Has a great opening and Smith does splendid for his first outing.)

However, although there are no explicitly overt past coming in, there are many references though-out: the library card and machine that show a picture of the first doctor, the 9th and 10th's control room appearing, holograms of the previous new companions, in a mini-episode all previous companions were shown, the 11th referencing K-9 at the department store, etc.  Remember, the Moff himself is a long time fan of Doctor Who as well, so I'm sure that referencing the past isn't something he meant to ignore.

true,douchebag_karren,rose,Rose,"This is going to be strange, because the 9th only has 13 episodes so figuring out my five favorite is hard because there aren't much to choose from, the 10 is my favorite but has three season to choose from, so it was hard because there were too many (and I cheated a bit) and the 11th is difficult because I don't really like Smith very much, so I'm not sure where to go from there. 

9th Doctor

1. The Empty Child/ The Doctor Dances - First apperance of Jack (Favorite Character). Has Rose in it (favorite main companion) Everybody Lives! There is dancing... (Jack/Rose, 9/Rose,) The always scary ""are you my Mummy?"" and the apperance of Giaus from Merlin as the doctor in the hospital. all around favorite episode of nine. 

2. Bad Wolf/ Parting of Ways- Has Jack and Rose in it (Seeing a pattern?) We get to play game show games until we ""Die"" and has one of the most important messages of Doctor who, When Rose figures out that she Is the Bad Wolf, and nothing can stop her. I love that she just keeps trying until she finds a way, and she left herself a message in the future to tell herself to keep going. I love the whole Bad Wolf subtext throughout the season, and the fact that While the Doctor is the Oncoming Storm, Rose is the Big Bad Wolf that you really need to be afraid of. 

3. The End of the World- The episode ""Rose"" didn't do much for me, but i was very interested when The End of the World started. Introduced one of my favorite villians (Cassandra), Gives you the idea that not all aliens (Besides the doctor) are bad. Show's you kind of just what the Tardis can do. and Kills off a likable character (The tree lady) to show you that death is possible on the show. We also get the ""bitchy Trampolene"" comment. 

4. The Unquiet Dead- Dickens and Gwen, although I admit to not knowing it was Gwen until someone online pointed it out several seasons later. We have fake ghosts and a great author, and lots of mystery. Again, sacrifice a good character to show that people die in this show. 

5. Boom Town - I may get some flack for this, but I'll stand by it. I do not hate the Slythine. Aliens of London wasn't the best, but in this episode where we just get this one, It's a good episode. It talks about morality and nature vs. nurture. she gets turned back into an egg to see if she could be a good slythine if raised by a different family. We Get Jack (again... pattern) and Rose and Micky have some emotional stuff where Micky realizes that Rose would never choose to stay on earth with him. All around good episode, and sets up the Rift in Cardiff. 

10th Doctor

1. Girl in the Fireplace- You'll notice there is no Blink on the list of favorite 10 episodes. Blink was really overhypped to me so when i saw it I wasn't impressed. Girl in the Fireplace is the exact opposite, no one told me about it, and I loved every second of it, even though Micky was in it. There's a horse on board a space ship, Rose has to deal with the Doctor paying attenion to another damsel in distress. We have the creepy ""if the clock is broken where is the ticking coming from?"" We get to see that not all Damsel in Distresses are Damsels in Distress, and they can take care of themselves. We get that first glimpse of just how sucky it is to be in love with a time traveler, and we're in France. 

2. Human Nature/ Family of Blood- Creepy and depressing episode. By the end I wanted to kill the Family, just so the Doctor could stay John Smith and live that life until she died, and then regenerate and go back to traveling. I didn't care for Martha much at this point, so I wouldn't have minded if she had stayed stuck there. I love what he does with them at the end, the realization that He was running for their own good, and they should have left well enough at home. We also get the heartbreaking line of ""Answer me this - just one question, that's all. If the Doctor had never visited us, if he'd never chosen this place... on a whim... would anybody here have died?... You can go now.""  and the amazing line of ""He's like fire and ice and rage, he's like the night and the storm in the heart of the sun, He burns at the center of time, and can see the turn of the universe. He's ancient and forever, and he's wonderful. 

3. Midnight- Scariest episode, blows Blink right out of the water. You never know what the bad guy is, and the humans are even worse than the alien. I would have liked to see the Saphire waterfalls, but I know why we never do. We also have Colin Morgan in this episode, which is good. and the angry line of ""Because I'm Clever."" which people finally call him out on as being pretenous. 

4. Planet of the Ood- Sad Episode. Donna is always good. Good lines include: ""Donna Noble: But look at us. We're everywhere. Is that good or bad though? Are we like explorers, or more like a virus? 
The Doctor: Sometimes I wonder.""  "" Ood Sigma: I think your song must end soon. 
The Doctor: Meaning? 
Ood Sigma: Every song must end. "" and One of my favorites: ""You idiot. They're born with their brains in their hands. Don't you see? That makes them peaceful! They've got to be, 'cos a creature like that would have to trust anyone it meets!""



5. Turn Left - We get to see just how important Donna, and all of the companions are really. What would happen if the Doctor didn't have a person to ground him. We apparently find out that England would turn to internment camps... which is depressing. We get Rose back (Always a good thing) The sad lines about Donna dying. There is the hint that Donna might start realizing just how special she is, and of course the end where all the signs turn to Bad Wolf. 

*Bonus* Special - The End of Time. - So I wanted to include others like, Journeys' end, because it had all the companions and did kind of show the doctor how militant he makes people, which is depressing, and Doomsday, because the ending, like Journey's end, is soo depressing, it made me cry for days, but really the bonus would have to be the End of Time. We get the Master back, we Understand the Time War, we get Wilf and another glimps of Donna. He visits all of the companions, even hooking Jack up with Allonzo. and seeing Rose for the First/Last time. (I always figured he would go back at least just once to see her before everything started) IF anything can break this five favorite list rule, it's this episode. 

The 11th Doctor- 

1. The Doctor's Wife - Written by Neil Gaiman... so That's always good. Old Tardis room. Rory gets to die a few times. We get the great line of ""You're not exactly reliable, you don't always take me where I want to go.... No But I always took you where you needed to go."" Also the ending where she's looking for the word ""I just wanted to say... Hello. Hello Doctor."" Great Episode. 

2. The Wedding of River Song- The only Smith episode to make me cry, so it had to be on the list. Mostly crying for River, for having to shoot the Doctor (even though I knew it was her the whole time as pretty much the entire River story arch was ruined for me before I saw the season) Love where all of time is happening at once, and Amy being a bamf is always good. Also confirmed how I figured they would get around the death of the doctor

3. The God Complex- Great episode. Dealing with both Faith and bogarts. Would love to see what was in the Doctor's room (ALthough I really think that he saw himself.) lots of great ideas about not worshiping him, a wonderful send off for Rory and Amy (don't know if they could improve on it this season. 

4. Vincent and the Doctor- The season's artist episode. Heartwarming to a point. Vincent was played very well. Love Amy's emotions through out. Alien seemed pretty cool. Didn't make me cry though

5. The Beast Below- This one struck a cord with me. again Humans are the bad guys. The Star Whale just wanted to help and the Humans tortured it. We see Amy stand up to the doctor, much like Donna did in Gridlock. another moral episode about forgetting the hard choices.",0,1335769351,null,0,false,0,c4i8zfh,t3_szb8c,t1_c4i8zfh,t3_szb8c,null,1428824897,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,istealreceipts,cnty-scotland,Lahndaaan,"I've lived in both Glasgow and Edinburgh. 

In all honesty, Edinburgh is made for tourists. It looks pretty. It's small enough to get round in a day or two and the town centre is pretty compact. I rule out going to Princes Street, the Old Town, the Bridges...anywhere that's walking distance from Waverley, since it's very hard to traverse the gaggles of tourists. Don't kid yourself that Edinburgh is only busy during the festival, it's all-year-round! 

I just found that there wasn't really that much to do, when you *live* in Edinburgh. Places like The National Gallery and all museums/galleries in Edinburgh are great, but it's not enjoyable when massive groups of noisy people are shuffling round taking pictures. 

I'm always impressed by the Christmas market and the transformation of Princes Street Gardens in Winter, and the Hogmanay celebration is fantastic. We went the the Hogmanay celebration for three years in a row and it just saddened me that I barely met anyone from Edinburgh at the celebrations. Met some of my fellow Weegies, but that's not the same!

But yeah, nightlife in Edinburgh is pretty abysmal, more-so now since Stephan King bought Cab Vol. There's hope yet, if he doesn't get hold of an old cinema and turn it into a nightclub. I have nothing but utter contempt for that man and what he has done to listed buildings in Glasgow (and by the looks of it, Edinburgh).

Glasgow is a better city to live in. It just has a more 'organic' feeling, seems less congested. Glasgow has a much better nightlife, live music scene and is a tad lighter on the ze purse. Also, I love the museums and parks in Glasgow.

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"My mate Lyndsey was playing piano in one of those piano bars on a cruise ship ( Royal Caribbean I think )  a few years ago and got into an affair with one of the passengers. They caught him red handed having sex with her in her cabin and literally booted him off the boat at St. Lucia; he had no money and no wages. His parents had to wire him money just so he could get back to blighty. 

Basically cruise lines treat their staff like absolute shit.

true,PolygonMan,null,null,"I'm actually very ok with him moving on in general, my issue is that it feels like it's not the same narrative anymore. There's almost nothing maintaining continuity between the episodes of the 10th and 11th doctors, other than a few tiny references (and honestly, when Rose showed up as the visualization for the Tardis in that one episode, it felt wrong. Like they were never even part of the same show.) I don't think that it would negatively affect any part of the narrative to have at least a few establishing shots here and there showing something like UNIT trying to respond to something (even if the Doctor decided not to contact or work with them). Just a bit of narrative here and there tying the series together beyond tiny references.
