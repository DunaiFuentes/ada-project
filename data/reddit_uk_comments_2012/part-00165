true,GypsieGenie,EN,england,"Today I gathered some facts about Fernando’s current physical condition that I found very important and clarifying, and I thought some of you might as well. Most of this was already well known before today, but now there are bits of really insightful information that IMO allow us to understand his situation better.
I wrote it in chronological order to give it more clarity and tried to remain as objective as possible (I don’t know if I succeeded though).
What triggered this whole episode was the fact that Fernando went through a couple of knee injuries during 2009 and 2010 that left him on the sidelines for the most part of the season.
 Guillem Balague and some other well-respected journalists, later revealed that during this period of time, Liverpool chose to give Fernando either false or incomplete information about the progress of his injuries, the only purpose of this being that he would play more, as he was the team’s most important and consistent player then, and the one who’d been single handedly winning matches for them.
 Fernando got two knee surgeries in the space of four months during that same season, and during his rehabilitation process, he pushed himself to the limit to make it to the World Cup. A few weeks later, he got a call up from Del Bosque to go to South Africa.
Spain lost their first match against Switzerland (a match Fernando didn’t start), which made Del Bosque re-shape his plans, and he included Fernando in the starting eleven for the next game.
Fernando still had some nagging pain, but his desire to be fit and attitude through his rehabilitation process encouraged the Spain medical staff to give him the green light to play for the rest of the tournament. His performances weren’t good and Del Bosque dropped him in favour of Pedro.
He didn’t start in the final, but he played the extra time and got involved in the play that lead to Iniesta’s goal.   
During the dying minutes of the match, Spain cleared a ball, which made Fernando sprint through the pitch, fall and get yet another painful groin injury. Shortly after that, the referee blew the final whistle and Spain became World Champions.
Liverpool sacked Rafa Benitez and appointed Roy Hodgson, but his poor run of results caused the owners to sack him as well and in came Kenny Dalglish. All of this happened between the summer of 2010 and January 2011.
  On January 31th, Liverpool sold Fernando to Chelsea. He wanted to leave and (contrary to what’s been said by both the club and most media outlets), Liverpool wanted to sell him as well.
  The Liverpool medical staff had known for a while that Fernando’s knee was still in a bad shape. The two surgeries he’d gone through and his rushed attempt to recover could prove to be fatal for him. But Liverpool firmly believed that if Chelsea were aware of that, they might not want to buy him anymore.
   The last day of the transfer window arrived, and even though Fernando had voiced his desire to leave about three or four weeks before and handed in a transfer request shortly after, Liverpool only made it known to the public on January 29th, two days before deadline. Luis Suárez was close to signing for them and as the Fernando move was imminent, they lined up Andy Carroll as his replacement.
  Torres arrived to Chelsea on the last day of the transfer window with a few minutes to go until midnight. A few journalists (such as Duncan Castles and Ben Jacobs) have stated that Fernando didn’t go through a complete medical at Chelsea as the clock was ticking and he had to sign his contract as soon as possible. So, Liverpool didn’t let Chelsea know about his condition, but Chelsea didn’t test him right away either, just concluded from very superficial scans that he was “lack of match fitness”.
After Fernando left to London, a Liverpool staff member said: “When Fernando left Melwood that day we were conscious of the possibility that he might come back”, because they didn’t  even think he’d pass the medical at Chelsea. But as there was no full medical and Chelsea never learned about his condition that day, Fernando signed for them and stayed.
  He arrived to London with a shot knee and to this day he hasn’t recovered from it. Liverpool knew this but chose to not disclose the information to Chelsea because they wanted to sell him and cash in while they could. Since then, Chelsea has found out about the problem, and hopefully has treated him accordingly. Earlier today, Ben Jacobs (who interviewed Rafa Benitez yesterday and talked about this situation with him), qualified Fernando’s injury as “degenerative”, and said the issue “has been apparent since before he moved from Liverpool, making that deal a fab bit of business”.
About eight days ago, Roman Abramovich called Rafa Benitez offering him the Chelsea job (way before the Juventus match took place), and Rafa accepted, but for obvious reasons, had to remain quiet about it. It is very likely that since then, the Chelsea medical staff has briefed him on Fernando’s situation (even though he already knew most of it because of their time together at Liverpool), as he told Jacobs that he knows about his condition in detail and that it’s the reason for his form and confidence issues.
So, these are the hard facts, and I’ve already stated my opinion on the matter several times on my blog today, so I will spare you from that. But in summary, Fernando was lied to and misinformed about possibly the single most important thing about his career by the very people he trusted to be honest to him about it, (which people knew about already because it’s been making the rounds since 2011 but it’s been made worse by the new information IMO). The Liverpool staff even thought he’d go back to Merseyside that same night on January 31th because they didn’t think he’d pass his medical at Chelsea.  
I’ve seen some people refer to Fernando’s injury as either “degenerative” or “chronic”, like I mentioned above. It got to be that way because it wasn’t dealt with properly in the past. There was some negligence involved as LFC’s medical staff didn’t let Fernando know about the progress of his injury so he could play more, and because Fernando rushed his recovery so he could play at the World Cup. To this day, he’s still suffering the consequences from it. Both Chelsea and Benitez are aware of the situation now and are working for him to get better. Now, it’s worth saying that we can’t be sure if this injury is “degenerative” in the sense that it gets worse with the passing of time and that the damage that’s been done to his knee is irrevocable, or “degenerative” in the sense that he’ll have some relapses from time to time but he’ll still be able to keep on playing at a good level. Let’s hope for the latter of course, it’s the less horrifying possiblity. 
And lastly, Fernando’s said several times before that there is a “truth” about the whole transfer and his last months at Liverpool that people don’t know about, that everything was not how it seemed/how it was portrayed, but that he doesn’t feel ready to talk about it just yet, though he might in the future when he’s not in the eye of the storm anymore. Well.
Here are some of the sources I took all of this from (though not all, because I’ve been reading about this since January 2011 and unfortunately I have lost some links, but here is the basic and most recent information): X (this article was tweeted today by Duncan Castles and it’s an excerpt from a larger article written by him on 2011, but you have to pay to see the whole thing so we’ll have to settle for this), X (about the non-existent medical), X (this one is only useful because it’s one of the articles where Balague says Liverpool lied to Fernando and it’s very recent, it’s in spanish though I translated most of it last week), and last but not least, X, Sid Lowe’s Feb. 2011 article about how there was more about the transfer than what it seemed at first glance (he mentions LFC’s twisting of facts during those last days of January). And the twitters of the journos I mentioned where a lot of the information is from:  https://twitter.com/DuncanCastles and https://twitter.com/JacobsBen
Edit: I forgot to say. It’s is very likely that we still don’t know plenty of things about this situation, but this is what there is out there atm. And tbh I’m not sure if I want to know more, it’s sickening enough as it is right now. 
Edit 2: Also, I’d completely understand any scepticism on the matter. I would doubt it all myself (wouldn’t look at it twice actually) if the information had had come from the likes of The Daily Fail, The Sun, or even The Mirror, and ofc from either Marca or AS. But the articles were all published in The Times, The National, The Guardian and Spain’s El Imparcial, and the journos are well-respected and usually very reliable. That was pm the only thing that made my head turn tbh. And not only most of the information is not new at all (as old as Feb. 2011), but Fernando’s alluded to most things here himself and Rafa Benitez confirmed them to Ben Jacobs just yesterday.

I think part of it was that I just really didn't like the characters that much so I had a hard time investing in them. With Peep Show, for example, the characters are somehow unlikeable and likeable at the same time. I think they're probably pretty awful guys to be around in real life, Mark and Jez, but I still really want to see what happens with them. With Spaced I just felt like I didn't care about the characters enough to really invest in the story. Dunno, it just felt like I had to work to like the show, and in the end, I just didn't like it that much. 

Plus, I felt like the allusions and homages became too important to the show, and it felt like it was trying too hard or at least I felt like it was too heavy-handed.

I was in my room searching for something but I couldn't remember what, when one of my friends shows up and tells me I'm looking for a pocket watch, and it was very important I'd find it. When I asked her why, she told me it was to stop the drumming. This is when I woke up in real life and heard The Master's drums coming from what sounded like the inside of my head.

I panicked. Not for long, maybe 5 seconds tops, but in those 5 seconds so much went through my delirious half-asleep mind. Why can I hear the drumming? Was I a secret timelord? Were my dreams trying to tell me that I've had a fob watch hidden that contains my secret timelord identity? Is my whole human life a lie? What am I hiding from? Does the show Doctor Who even exist or did my mind invent it to try and alert me to my true self? 

And then it all went away when I remembered that the night before, I had changed the vibration pattern on my phone to the beat of The Master's drums and someone was calling me, which is what woke me up. The dream was just a coincidence. But man... for 5 terrifying and thrilling seconds, I was a timelord.

Secondly, ""many people see any none *[sic]* white British as immigrants, e.g. Poles"" could mean that many people see non white British people (by whichever meaning of ""non white British"") as immigrants, and Poles are an example of the kind of immigrant these non white British could be seen as. Or you might mean ""Poles"" as an example of a non white British person. Or you might mean ""Poles"" as an example of the kind of people who might see non white British people as immigrants (though that last one seems like an unlikely interpretation).

So with two meanings of ""non white British"" and three meanings of ""e.g. Poles"" I find myself faced with at least 6 possible meanings of what you just said. Admittedly it's late and my brain is not braining well.

If that weren't true then the monarchy would not be an hereditary system. Whether or not they bring some cash into the country on the back of few tourists should not be the main focus on the question as to if we should continue to lend our support to a system built on inequality.

true,heyzuess,eng-northumberland,Northumberland,"**edit** a lot of people are finding this difficult to understand. I'm not defending the system, I'm explaining it. I'm a foster carer, I've been through all of this stuff in the past. The only thing that you really need to consider is that the rules that exist, exist for a reason, and there are no exceptions to the rules when you're working with foster children. ever.

Finding cultural matches is important for many reasons far beyond political ideals - including dietary needs, religious needs, location needs etc. Changing the childs circumstances anymore than they already have been is unneeded. My experience of the fostering system is that every rule exists for a reason, and it's always to protect the child.

Fostering and adoption are two significantly different proceses. Adoption could include the responsibility of ""fixing"" (terrible choice of words, but I can't think of another) the child if they have issues. Fostering is about granting a child a safe and comfortable place to stay - normally in the short term. 

It is entirely reasonable that a foster child, who has almost always been the subject of abuse in one form or another, should be placed in an environment where **they** feel comfortable, not where society thinks taht it would like the child to feel comfortable. The entire fostering system exists to make the sure that children in society are safe and comfortable.

true,woadgrrl,scottish,Western Isles,"You're assuming that these children are infants, or at least very young toddlers, who haven't already absorbed their parents culture.  That's a huge assumption.  By the time a child has learned to speak, it's already absorbed a huge amount of cultural identity.  It's learned a particular language, particular expressions and slang.  It's almost certainly developed particular food preferences, as well as all manner of other customs and traditions.  So your argument about a child being a blank slate is incorrect.

Additionally, you're assuming that the parents have completely abandoned the child.  As far as I'm aware, the goal with most children in care is to ultimately reunite them with their birth family, and this often happens.  And even in cases where fostering is a long-term, or even permanent situation, it's not necessarily the case that the child will have zero contact with their birth parents, or with siblings, grandparents or extended family.  

So, I'm sorry, but I do think there's a case to be made for protecting a child's cultural interests.  Does that concern trump all other considerations?  No.  Is it preferable to place a child in a loving, permanent home with a family of a different culture, than to have them bounce through a series of temporary placements and institutions?  Of course.

But in this particular case, based on the information presented in the linked article, I don't think the council was out of order.

In the dictionary racism is defined as thinking that one race is superior to another, purely due to race. It does not mean, you use the word paki or make a joke about black people BAM you are a fully pledged racist. It does not mean you call a black guy a monkey twitter BAM Jail.

This isn't how a grown up society deals with these things, the government shouldn't even get involved. The government should make a level playing field for all, women, men, blacks, whites, Indians, asians, etc. Society then steps in to show people that judging people solely on their color isn't a good thing, i.e. you'll have less friends.

I think dealing with multiculturalism is one of the key problems this country needs to tackle this century.

As an aside - I went to a conference where the guys who did the fit4life campaign presented.  They said their initial efforts were wasted because whilst parents in general agreed that child obesity was a problem, very few of them thought that their child was obese.  Any messages that they sent out saying ""Stop your kid being obese"" didn't work because parents thought that they were aimed at other parent's kids.  That was why they moved back to a generic ""get fitter, be healthier"" message (I'm paraphrasing).

Like Quazz said, don't go into it expecting something perfect. It's very short-sighted to expect a lot from a £10 game from a company where this is their first full game, It's not supposed to be a game as great as Black Ops 2 (which itself has a fair few bugs and negative points about it) and that's at £40.

But for just around £10 (as compared to the £40 the big titles ask for), It's well worth it. You get a pretty fun game that can keep you busy for a fair while. Hell, a movie costs more than that you can get 2-4x more out of this than a movie. It's ties in rather well, complete with a story (and a cliffhanger!) and excellent voice acting by the characters. Some new adaptations of the monsters as well.

It can be a bit too hard at some points, sure and that might be a worry for someone who has little kids who wants to play it.

I find it more of a ""set up"" game. It's the company's first go and a trial for the BBC too and it worked better than I thought it would be.

**Wall of text for those who want to go further into the subject**


Personally i think being British needs to be redefined too. What does it mean to be British? Does it mean to be a white imperialist? Maybe in another age, but right now, what does it mean and how will it help me find a place within my community and within society as a whole?

I think, being British, is about supporting your community, helping your neighbors, cleaning your streets, being polite and just offering a helping hand where you can and paying into the tax system for the benefit of not only yourself, but for everyone else around you. 

I'm living in Beijing right now, first thing I noticed when I came here, there is a REAL sense of community. And it is GREAT. Not a Communist kind of ""working arm in arm with my fellow comrades for the glory of etc..."" but a traditional, strangers helping strangers mentality. The old, rather than being left alone with a TV, are out helping passers by, teaching kids in schools, while the adults are out providing a living.

They realise that their friends and family live in this place and that the best they can do for them is make it a better place to live in, not through huge government subsidies or grants, but purely just by doing your part.

It snowed the other day right, streets are covered in about 2 inches of snow, pretty bad for a city where the traffic is already horrendous, lord knows it would bring the UK to a standstill. 

Did people sit inside, watch TV and drink tea? NO. The streets where packed with people from 7am+ clearing the streets and roads by hand! They weren't paid to do this, but they realised that if they did their part, the whole city could function as normal. It was amazing to see.

No one never once thought ""oh what if he falls over on the snow, he might sue me"" or ""that person needs help crossing the road, but what if they say I attacked them"". It doesn't happen, people care about each other here. Sure it might be easier because they are ALL Chinese so race doesn't really come into it.

But regardless of race in the UK we still have to live with each other, and as Charlie Chaplin said ""we want to live by each others happiness not each others misery"". 

**That was a little anecdote for those interested, the main point** 
During the London riots I was watching the BBC, I watched as a black guy came on who ""Represented the black community in Camedon"" or wherever in London. He basically said the white man is blah blah, police are racist blah blah, black people don't stand a chance blah blah.

**BULLSHIT** This is where the problem starts! Blaming others for your mistakes! Look at the Chinese for example, **JUST BECAUSE** you are Chinese, it does not mean that you will do better in school and get a better job than others... *However* the **CHANCES** of your family and community that you are involved in putting a greater value on education is **HIGHER**. 

If you grow up in a community where everyone blames the scape goat, that they are being oppressed, that they don't have equal opportunities etc, that they *shouldn't* respect their culture or neighborhood because it's akin to supporting the white upper class banksters, then **of course** they are going to be less likely to get into Oxford and the like.

Getting the government to step and say ""we need more black people in Oxford now!"" isn't solving anything, it's going to create a bigger divide between people.

What needs to be done is to establish a society (being british) that we all live in that is made of our different cultures and experiences where all are cherished (except from the xenophobic ones).

Also we need to stop teaching kids about JFK and start teaching them about the Emipre as well, this part of history is HUGELY relevant to modern day history, it will help establish a sense of pride, purpose and understanding of our country.  Teach the good and bad, let kids learn from the mistakes, let the slave trade be tought but also show that we were the first nation to fully abolish slavery.

Theres things that all nations can be proud of when it comes to being British and it will also reestablish a connection with our old friends in India, Hong Kong, Jamaica, Canada, Australia, South Africa etc (the list if huge).",0,1353766060,null,0,false,0,c760pxx,t3_13pj0u,t1_c760pxx,t1_c760jbc,null,1430487065,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

Yes corporations (and other interest groups like the NRA) have more influence as money is much more important in US politics (For adverts in swing states, as an example). Also, there are more access points i.e. fail in the Senate, next step go to the House so even if a Bill is passed in one chamber it can be blocked in another. 

That said, you could argue that some of these lobbying groups do provide valuable expertise as politicians 'know a little about a lot' e.g. Greenpeace could provide info on climate change and renewable energy. And the groups counter balance each other e.g. Greenpeace lobbying could be cancelled out by lobbying from the oil industry.

- Suarez and Michu may well be key men, but they don't play the same position. As I commented below, I don't care how many dribbles Michu makes or completes, because it's irrelevant. 

- Also, why include % completion of final third passes without also showing how many final third passes they make per match? I'd be interested to see whether Suarez still out-passes Michu despite playing a more advanced role, even if he is a false 9.

- Why not compare Suarez with Danny Graham and Michu with Shelvey/Sahin? (Excluded Suso because he's only played 30 minutes as an attacking midfielder in the league). 

- So we're comparing Joe Allen with...Joe Allen? Sigh. Compare him with Leon Britton; they're playing the same role at the moment.

- Rangel has played at right-back all season, why are you comparing him with 3 centre-backs?

- Why go with open play pass completion % for Dyer and Sterling, rather than (or along with) pass completion in the final third? And again, quantity of passes per game would be good as well. Equally, why look at just dribbled past, when you've included dribbles attempted/completed earlier for central players?

- Also, for a piece entitled 'possession and penetration', the author doesn't really talk much about either - most of the comparisons they've made in this piece are between the areas of the two systems that are most similar to each other. It would have been more interesting to see how Laudrup uses the fullbacks in comparison to Rodgers - are they pushing up more? less? roughly the same? And central midfield, as well - Swansea this year are a bit more direct, and that would have shown in the passing statistics of the midfielders. Those are the areas that are far more likely to show differences than Dyer vs Sterling, or comparing the two sets of centre-backs.

- I'm presuming they didn't have chance creation stats available, otherwise I'd really hope to see those included.",0,1353768740,null,0,false,0,c7612c8,t3_13plub,t1_c7612c8,t3_13plub,null,1430487227,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

I wonder if these parents actually know the detail about UKIP's attitudes to multiculturalism, or even agree with them.

That's how parties work: you sign up for the core beliefs, and you might not agree with everything in the mix, but you hope to change a few things around from within.

There are plenty of people who agree with UKIP's core premise - that EU membership is bad for Britain - who probably don't give a damn about multiculturalism. I have a horrible feeling the people in charge are members of more pro-EU parties who are either consciously or subconsciously acting out of political hatred.

I wonder if the parents were asked about their beliefs relating to race. I presume they were. And I presume that this should take precedence over any party line for an organisation whose primary platform is nothing to do with race.

Strangely the people in charge are actually enforcing a policy the much more racist BNP would approve of, probably without realising it. It's all very sad.

As a mixed raced kid living in a white area that was pretty racist I got bullied a lot by white kids cos of my looks. While my parents did the best to address my issues they were out of their depth as they had never had to face up to anything like this when they grew up so couldn't see how it affected me. Also they were pretty much part of this dominant white culture themselves and quite often came out with racist comments without for a single second realising what they were saying and the impact it was having on me.

I think we need to be aware in this case though that this was  a fostering placement, not an adoption so the factors at play are a little different.

Would you place a Jewish baby with a Muslim family or vice versa without having some concerns about what that would do psychologically to the child?

It's often difficult for bonds to stick between adoptees and adopters so the fewer overt visible differences that exist can help remove some of the risks of failed adoptions. 

As I mention elsewhere this case was a fostering placement which is by its nature short term. I would be concerned about placing kids with any family who have declared political interest along the lines of those of UKIP to be honest.

That places quite a burden on any children (particularly those who might need adoption or foster care).

As for supporting discrimination on the basis of ideology; not alone (that would be contrary to the ECHR and CFREU) - people should be judged on their actions. However, a person's ideology (for example, that they believe red-haired children are evil) may give an indication of future actions (i.e. abuse towards red-haired children) that could be grounds for taking action (such as not allowing them to adopt red-haired children). Yes, it is an extreme example, but not beyond the realms of possibility.

We've been given a broadly one-sided ""headline"" argument as if it's a wide-ranging council policy. From what Thacker says it's a very specific instance where these particular children and this particular couple aren't a good match. There's also a lack of context in the reporting - she mentions longer-term background issues in respect of the council not meeting other foster children's cultural needs in the past. We don't know what these are, or what outcomes previous foster children have experienced as a result of (presumed) inaction by the council in similar circumstances.

It doesn't sound like this was a flippant box-ticking exercise - if lawyers are giving advice on the case then clearly it was a difficult decision and wasn't taken lightly. It's also worth noting that the couple aren't being prevented from fostering children altogether, and in any event these particular children were only being fostered temporarily with the couple. It's not a reflection on the couple - it's more like a reflection on some incident that the council are attempting to avoid occurring (again).

Ultimately I think the council were between a rock and a hard place, and any decision would have been the 'wrong' one to some stakeholders.

true,ben9345,english,London,"Or course its relevant. Its the social services job to ensure children are cared for in the correct environment. Naturally i'm not comparing their severity, that's obvious I hope (maybe it wasn't for the people downvoting) but the point stands. If the child might be in the wrong environment whether because of abuse or simply because they would grow up unhappy because they thought their parents subscribed to an ideology that disagreed with their being in the country, social services have a duty to act in that situation. Getting angry at the social workers in these less serious cases where the wrong decision was made (again, i'm not saying the decision should stand; yet another thing people seem to be misunderstanding in what i'm saying) is not going to help anyone. In fact it may make social workers less likely to act in situations where the consequences could be more serious. Mistakes will happen and my point is that if we can make them occur because of over-reactions like this by allowing leeway to social workers to act when then feel they need to then that will mean that mistakes will be much less likley to occur in cases of abuse which is surely better for everyone. 

Everyone seems to be implying that the social worker was just being malicious and saw no real threat. Even if she is naive or prejudiced but perceived a possibility of an unhappy life for the child then she should have acted. If she is indeed prejudiced then she can be removed from the social services but my basic point is i'd rather see action rather than reaction to cases both serious and not so serious and crucifying social services in these cases is pushing them into non-action.

They deserve some leeway. Its why we don't sue the police every time they arrest people even if it turns out later that they don't have a case against that person. A policeman cannot assess all the facts immediately but if there is a risk of something bad happening it would be wrong for them to leave a potential criminal on the streets. Equally if, for whatever reason, a social worker feels there is a risk that the child could be unhappy it would be a denigration of duty to leave the child there. Take them out as a precaution and assess the facts. It can reversed later.

They may have the gumption to avoid being overtly racist, but everyone knows their xenophobic attitudes to immigration belie their actual bigotry. Just look at what was tweeted by Ferage a year ago: *""every time I go on public transport in London (which is often!) I'm surrounded by people who don't speak English!""* And who can forget that they had to backtrack very swiftly after one of their leading spokesmen – climate change denying nutjob Christopher Monkton – [urged far right British Freedom Party members to come and join UKIP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkC6jVPrWns#t=28m11s).

It ***is*** a witch hunt! Every single person attacking this social worker seems to be ignoring key facts from this case and focusing instead on the misleading appeal to emotion used by the foaming-mouthed right-wing press. For starters, they weren't *their* children! They were only put into their care as an emergency (and *temporary*) measure. Secondly, the children were only with them for two months, but you'd think they'd been with them for years, judging by some of the comments I'm reading here. Thirdly, again, the service had previously been severely criticized by the courts (over these same children) for not doing more to ensure their cultural and ethnic needs. If she hadn't taken the action she did, she would almost certainly have fallen foul of the courts again. So how is it fair that she should now be sacked for taking on board the court's previous warnings? But putting all of that aside, the main concern here is the welfare of the children. And while there is no evidence the couple did them any harm whatsoever, it is nevertheless not unreasonable to decide that their UKIP membership reflects badly on their suitability to care for children with an immigrant ethnicity. Finally, no-one has suggested the couple shouldn't be allowed to continue fostering children that are more suitable for them.",0,1353785733,null,0,false,0,c764i8i,t3_13ov4k,t1_c764i8i,t1_c762lz7,null,1430488912,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4

There have been some mentions of studies on confusion if a child doesn't look sufficiently similar to parents.

So long as the parents are as good as any other average parents, i think it's better that the child have some, then not at all.

true,myrightbuttock,null,null,"BritRedditor1 is spot on, lobbying groups with less money such as Greenpeace are dwarfed by the larger energy and pharmaceutical companies. The US system is quite transparent though and subject to regulation that exceeds the UK system, lobbyists must register themselves for example and their employer which allows you to see who is spending the money. OpenSecrets is a good site where you can see how much companies have spent on lobbying, you can then compare a companies performance historically to their lobbying expenditure which generally shows a trend that lobbying is quite successful for businesses. 

The revolving door is quite bad in the US, staffers of congressmen and elected officials regularly leave to become lobbyists, while Senators and Congressmen often leave to become executives in various corporations, banks in particular. Influence is not restricted to lobbying either, JP Morgan for example has seen executives become elected officials and serve as advisors for the President. This can reduce transparency but for the most part the US system is easy enough to follow and monitor.

I like the transparency of the US but at the same time lobbyists wield tremendous influence there, skewing government policy. The UK seems to have resisted this to a degree, perhaps due to cultural differences? Hopefully someone with a bit more knowledge of UK politics can help there.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The reason it wasn't economically wise for NI to join the ROI previous to 2008 was because the country is in a shambolic economic state, with a public sector making up approximately one third of all employment, which is a massive public spending burden.

The North would have crashed the South.

Now, the South is the economically weaker country. This happened in the space of a year.

Who is to say what will happen economically in a lifetime? In one lifetime we've seen Northern Ireland go from an industrial powerhouse of shipbuilding and linen manufacture to an economic wasteland with almost no industries and a painful dependence on government employment. In one lifetime we've seen the south go from the economic badlands to become the 5th richest per capita nation in the world, and in a single year we saw them fall from grace, yet the south is still far more economically advanced than it was in, say, the 50s.

NI isn't going to benefit economically from leaving the UK not because the UK is particularly good, but because we are incredibly shit. Our small country has no real industries, no resources, nothing. Our massive public sector is subsidised by the UK, that's the only benefit for us. Not because we're getting some sort of great deal in trade or something.

I think NI's current dependence on the public sector is totally unsustainable. If the private sector can be boosted to make up say, 90% of employment, and companies are bringing foreign money in, then there's no reason why the South couldn't support the North.

Both countries have the same issue, foreign money is not coming in through large businesses.

But I see this as a temporary problem. With the rise of the Asian middle classes, outsourcing of jobs will eventually become unprofitable. If, when that happens, both countries have low rates of corporation tax and skilled and well educated workforces, then they will attract the corporations, and more money will come in. If, and when that happens, then both countries will be on economic parity. By the time that happens Catholics will well outnumber Protestants, and there will be little incentive to maintain the union.

Really all this shows is  Unionist desperation. They are now clinging on the fickle and obviously temporary support of pragmatic catholics for the union because they sense their own impending loss of majority. 

I doubt the UK will collapse if Scotland leaves (if they can find a way to insure fiscal stability then it's entirely possible they will), but it will become much more conservative, as the loss of Scotland will destroy much of the Labour party's base support. This is unlikely to be well supported by anyone in Northern Ireland, because they will push for ever more breakdown of the public sector. Unemployment will rise here as they attempt to curb public spending with no private sector jobs for those sacked to occupy.

I think the future is a difficult thing to predict, but those who cite economic reasons for an Irish union being impossible are failing to learn the lesson of history, that is, everything can change in an eyeblink.",0,1353793033,null,0,false,0,c7665qr,t3_13pyt7,t1_c7665qr,t1_c765bs6,null,1430489796,20,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,20

The amount of prep they put into it shows. Also at the end they have a sudden death round, where you have to answer all correct (you can hand the sheet in incomplete at any time before the next question is asked).

Fullbacks are expected to go up and down the pitch without stopping, center backs may act as midfielders in games with plenty of possession. Formation wise, I think he plays a 4-2-3-1 with an explosive front 3 of Gotze, Reus, and Grosskreutz all supporting Lewandoski. The holding midfielders are much more active in the game, with Kehl and Gundogan pushing forward and creating lots of opportunities. Based on my observations, I think his tactics and ideas would be excellent with our new young Chelsea with Hazard, Mata, and Oscar.

Forgive the sweeping generalisations here, but as sad as I am, I can't be arsed doing an in-depth sociological report on my Saturday night when I'm this drunk.

  The ubiquity of acceptance/tolerance in British society has forced the Conservative Party to promote socially liberal policies in order to be electable - David Cameron is a fierce proponent of Gay marriage. In spite of this, the rebels are backbenchers, so are unrepresentative of this modern Conservatism as they are mainly elderly/Christian (and hold on the views of their upbringing where gayness was seen as either depraved or sinful) or from rural constituencies (so they remain unaffected by the cultural melting-pot of our cities). Finally, a trip to /r/ukpolitics will tell you how out of touch and unrepresentative the conservative party are, compared to the rest of Britain.

I knew a guy who was in the Youth Parliament so I have a bit of an idea of its demographics: The members are mainly 15/16 IIRC so 'Gay anxiety' means many of the members hold on to the juvenile view that if you're friends with gays, or support them, you are gay yourself and subject to ridicule by your peers.

 Also the youth parliament has skewed demographics in order to uphold the facade that the lower echelons of society are represented in government. Thus it has a high amount of Muslim kids - who are taught homosexuality is a sin, and as a rule, are still reliant on their parents so haven't risked rebelling against these views. And kids from other minorities/sub-cultures where homosexuality carries a social stigma.

Whoah.  Intense!  Don't hate me for assuming you've had a good Saturday night eh? ;-)  

&gt;If we were Greeks, this subreddit would be filled with anti EU links and how fucked up it is that our vote and democratic right has been REMOVED BY THE EU, which is what has happened to those people. 

Yes.  What the EU has done to Greece, largely on behalf of French and German banks and US reinsurers, is horribly undemocratic.

&gt;although people like you might think 'oh I suppose' when pointed to the obvious hardships this dictatorship is resulting in, the general population will just look at what's happening from a common sense standpoint and think 'FINE, WE WANT OUT'. 

What do you suppose my views on the EU and Greece are then?  You might find me reassuringly Eurosceptic, although perhaps for converse reasons to you, but nonetheless...

&gt;It's why I'm voting UKip. I'd vote for a party who wanted to keep us in, mind. But that party would have to want us to join the Euro. We'd have to join the Euro, push for the European Central Bank to be moved to London, (we have 40% of the global financial transactions processed in London - New York has 20%, so it would only seem fitting) and then push for a united states of Europe, with England as the capital and every country in it as a state.

A believer in a new British Empire?  I admire your spirit if not your goals...

&gt;Thankfully for people like you, people like me are the majority of our country. 

I wouldn't put it quite like that, but okay...  It's certainly true that the UK is mostly a boringly conservative nation, with flashes of brilliance in the cracks.  But it's also true that there are intense stresses under the surface.  Much as you might abhor it, change may be on the way whether you like it or not - you might have a choice in whether it comes with a bang or a whimper, but I don't think the economics will allow you to put it off forever.  Natural resources, as you say...

The people who don't like talking about politics and just get on with their ""common sense"" lives are, unfortunately, the people who are probably ensuring it will be an unpleasant wrenching bang when it comes because they want to keep their heads in the comfortably familiar sand until the last minute but unfortunately, they don't see that the last minute is at hand if it isn't already passed/past...",0,1353799924,null,0,false,0,c767ro0,t3_13pj0u,t1_c767ro0,t1_c767c8k,null,1430490526,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Child protection services in the UK over-react hugely to any and every imagined or hypothetical problem at the moment. This has stemmed from two tragic, and high profile, cases (Baby P and Victoria Climbie) where children died and child protection was blamed for failing to take action earlier. In one of these cases the local council's head of children's services was sacked. Children's services are now running an unofficial zero tolerance policy on anything that may come back to haunt them in the future.

true,RadioFreeReddit,canada,Rebel [Virginia],"When I talk about culture I am not talking anything besides politics. Other nation's music and art and culture and what is not that different from culture to culture.

Imagine a democratic nation where there are two cultures: one that believes in extreme property rights, and another than do not believe in property rights. People from both cultures will try to elect politicians into the democracy that reflects their views of property rights. Election times are extremely partisan because each culture has a different view of what fairness is with respect to property rights, and more importantly each culture will think that the other culture is cheating them using democracy to impose the other definition of property rights on the differing population.

Multiculturalism says that all cultures are equal. In some cases... perhaps the difference is not that big of a deal, Other cases it is definitely a big deal. A cultural belief in freedom of speech is superior to the belief that state has the right to hurt people who give opinions that are contrary to what the state allows. There are people from these nations where that is common sense to them that the government should be allowed to restrict whatever speech that is not approved by it.

If the nations of the west take in too many immigrants too fast to the point were their culture gets enough MPs and TDs (not really Congressmen, because this hasn't been too much of an American problem yet) elected then they will use democracy to reflect their values- like having laws against blasphemy like such that are on the books in Ireland, and countries in Europe.

First off, your definition of there being ""two types of people"" is wrong.

And independent of this, when growing up, they may identify more with the male gender, the female gender or even neither.

So it's not as clear cut as you imagine.

In addition, heterosexual couples can't induce pregnancy if either or both partners are infertile. By your argument, you would deny marriage to them too. Not to mention asexual couples.

And actually there is a legal type of same-sex marriage: transgendered people can legally marry people with opposite gender, even if they have retained their original birth sex.

People who do not share the majorites viewpoint are not necessarily immigrants. I know multiple communists who are not immigrants.

The few who didn't would be outnumbered by those who did most likely to the same ratio as those who already live in our country.

Also, the way our political system works means the minorities viewpoint will never be represented. These people who believe this would need to be concentrated in one area so much that they outweigh the country's political beliefs, which could never happen. In Ireland, where they use proportional representation, this is a possibility, but certainly not in the UK.

UKIP do not hold their beliefs politically, as they would first need to get in power before they could change anything, and believing in a non-existent problem that nobody else cares about would not help them. Likewise, they cannot claim to be affected politically by immigration, as they have never been a prominent party.

However, it's not hypocritical, because it's not about how the animal is actually killed... 

In the EU, animals must be *stunned and rendered unconscious BEFORE they are killed* (with exemptions made for ritual slaughter). The way in which they are killed isn't really the moral issue here, it's whether it can experience pain. In ritual slaughter, the animals must have their throats slit whilst they are conscious. Some countries have made it a legal requirement to stun the animal immediately after it's throat has been slit to minimise pain, but why? Just fucking ban the practise. If they don't like it, they can be vegetarian. Also, it actually states in the Quran that if there is no other food available, non-Halal food is okay. So, there's no need for this bollocks.

Also, mass commercial ritual slaughter is far more barbaric than anyone seems aware of. Traditional slaughter is, I'm sure, perhaps better than the EU regulations, but that's NOT how it's done for the majority. The animals are loaded one at a time into a machine which clamps them still, turns them up-side-down and then their throat is slit. Cows don't tend to get turned upside-down on a regular basis, so I'm pretty sure that being clamped in a machine and span around is exceptionally stressful.",0,1353807742,null,0,1353808839,0,c769jea,t3_13l7if,t1_c769jea,t1_c7582gq,null,1430491365,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I think he'd have done well with us, it's a shame it didn't happen as I'm sure he would have accepted the role of manager if offered it.

I think as Liverpool have declined over the last few years and certain other clubs have performed better than us and grown their off the field revenues a stripped down back to basics attitude with a manager who might be younger but have a huge education in coaching would have worked out great.

Benitez can only work with what he's got at each team he's managed, and he strikes me as being smart enough to realise that you've got to utilise your strengths - which for us is our midfield, so I wouldn't expect any major shake up in that department. 

The only other changes he can make are to the defence and to Torres...and to be honest I'll be glad if he does try something new defensively and he's probably the best man to try and get some kind of consistent form out of Torres. Getting towards last chance saloon with Torres.

I'm hoping that the team could benefit from having someone as professional as Benitez at the helm. The squad clearly loved Di Matteo, and so did us fans - but I think some of the sloppy performances can be attributed (at least in part) to the relationship between the players and Di Matteo; they clearly respected each other but there was no authority. I'm hoping that a no-nonsense 'outsider' coming in and taking control of the dressing room will make the players keep their heads down and focus entirely on winning football matches. That's what all involved want, so here's hoping that Rafa can instil some coherence and rigidity into our performances.

Forty stone o' loveliness and evr'y bit's her own.""
Ee she were a big 'un, Wi't accent on the big,
And all the fellas wi' walking sticks kept giving her a dig.
She were a great big lassie, as didn't know her chassis
Were blown up wi' air I do declare.
Well everthin' were champion, until some silly clown,
Stabbed her with a pin - said the showman with a frown
""All hands to the pumps lads, mi vessel's goin' down"",
At the Rawtenstall Annual Fair.

""Roll up, roll up, see the house o' myst'ry,
Ladies pay a tanner to be tickled in the dark.""
In went the lads, just for a peep,
The showman pulled a lever and they landed in a heap.
Well, down he shot 'em, right to the bottom,
Frills and things for ev'ryone to see.
There were shoutin', screamin', ev'rythin' were rife,
I saw some funny things I've never seen in all mi life,
I saw some funny things I've never seen upon mi wife,
At the Rawtenstall Annual Fair.

""Roll up, roll up, come and see the mermaid,
See the lovely lady, half a woman, half a fish.""
In went the lads, to show it wasn't swank,
When little Tommy Higgins put some whisky in the tank.
Well, she got frisky, swimmin' in the whisky,
And when she came up for air,
She bowed to the audience, gave her tail a swish,
Her tail it came off and she really looked delish.
She said ""What do you want boys, a bit o' meat or fish"",
At the Rawtenstall Annual Fair.

""Roll up, roll up, see the tattoed lady,
See the lovely lady with the pictures on her skin.""
In went the lads and they began to cheer,
To see that on her back were all the towns o' Lancashire.
There were Odsall Bottom, Manchester City,
The town hall standin' in the square.
There were Oldham, Bolton, Ashton-under-Lyne,
'Coal pit up at Burnley were lookin' mighty fine,
Till someone shouted ""Daddy, don't go down the mine"",

I mean, if you are a religious person and believe that the soul should be something granted to someone by god (or similar concept) than you probably should believe she was in heaven regardless of the doctors action.

But let's ignore the the religious aspect for the purpose of this discussion. If you do so, we (our body) are basically a collection of Biochemical processes, mostly regulated by our genome and epigentic markers. That can easily be saved. We almost have the technology for that now a days, they certainly will in the future. 

what is left is our concept of conscience and personality. That is stored mostly in our brain, in the form of our memories (though the actual storage happens trough neuron connections and changes in the brain chemistry). That is what molds us. If we can extract all that is stored in our brains, and save all of our genetic and epigenetic code, than, to the best of my knowledge (and ignoring metaphysical/religious aspects) we have all we need to reconstruct ourselves. 

So if the doctor saved her memories and if those are in an environment that replicates/simulates all the chemical processes in her body than she is, in a sense, indistinguishable from being alive.

I, myself, prefer his lesser spoken name, The Oncoming Storm.

Edit: Also, even if your comment held some semblance of truth you'd still be wrong. His name is not The Doctor *or* Doctor Who. His name is unknown to all but him and these are merely titles obscuring his true name.

I know there are a couple serials where I have been able to find 3 out of 4 episodes. Prior to Pertwee, many (most?) of the episodes are lost and that means you can't even buy them - they've ceased to exist except perhaps forgotten in the corner of someone's attic in an old recording (or so we can dream). There is audio of them, and some recons, but that's all. There are novelisations of most if not all the classic serials, so if you have trouble finding one you can always just read the novelisation.

I have a lot of time for him as a comedian and personally I enjoy his work, but I don't find him to be this visceral truth seeker that his fans seem to hold him up as.  

The idea that stand up comics should be held up as any kind of serious paragon, to me, goes against one of the core premises of comedians of his ilk, that you should think for yourself.  
Its unavoidable as comedy is essentially just entertainment and comedians can't help but attract a like minded audience and avoid the inevitable circle jerk. But once you reach the point where you're just preaching to the choir, who are, in turn, all slapping each other on the back for being smart enough to 'get it', you're in danger of becoming as ridiculous as the things you're ridiculing.

I'm not sure if this game will be good for us or them. On one hand, BR knows how Swansea plays and knows their players well, so he'll certainly pass on some information off to our lads. On the other hand, Swansea players are familiar with BRs tactics and may know how to combat it well.

I certainly hope Henderson starts. He's hardworking and closes down very well, which is what we need against Swansea, since they are a passing-oriented team. We can't let them have their way on the ball to much. If we were to compare it to Barcelona vs Real Madrid (or Portugal vs Spain in the Euros), Madrid/Portugal always works very hard to press their midfielders to make sure they can't pass forward and play however they want to in our final third. Sahin also works rather hard and I think, quite frankly, we should either play Henderson-Sahin-Gerrard or Henderson-Sahin-Allen. The first perhaps so that Allen doesn't have to face his old club who probably knows him and his playstyle very well, or the first to go for a more defensive approach in terms of pressing and keeping possession.

I think to combat a team like Swansea, we'll need a lot of speed, so I'm hoping Assaidi gets his chance here.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"This is responsible, partly. I'd say what you guys are complaining about with downvotes is most of the time reddit tweaks. The rest of the time it is almost always bots. The problem is a lot more pronounced on /r/soccer than it is here, but it still exists in this subreddit (since it became popular enough to target).

I would guess that &lt;1% of the downvotes actually come from other fans, or 'rivals' or whatever you want to refer to them as coming into here and downvoting things. It's not that it doesn't happen, its just that they get sick of doing it after 5-6.

On a number of occasions I have been in arguments with others in /r/soccer and the other person would go into my comment history and just downvote everything for no reason. Even the most dedicated guy only lasted 15-20 downvotes.

The other thing is, with this subreddit the content flow isn't high. We average 10-12 new posts  day. The point of karma is to rank posts. It doesn't have much effect here. The age of the post has more of a bearing on its position than the score (to a point). 

Same applies for comments. Its just ranking them. Only the match threads get long enough to where you want better comments to stand out at the top and voted on properly. Keep this in mind when you upvote/downvote - ie. how relevant the comment is to the discussion and how interesting it is and if it should be further up the thread - not if you agree with it or not

Art can be really important. Imagine where we'd be without those idiots who ate some funny mushrooms and drew a stick man and a buffalo on the wall of their cave. 

There is an unfortunate paradox(?) insofar as Mr Lee has made cerebral art in a field that masks it's artiness under timing and laughs. He is a unique artist and an entertainer and those who get it tend to then feel separate from those who don't get it. It seems to me that Lee's work is actually all about the divide between those who get it and don't and how a certain alienation is inevitable between the two groups. And the crux of the biscuit is the more you think you get it, the less you get it. If you think you got him, he will know you didn't.

Actually, their play has changed enough for it to be significant - they're a bit more high-tempo and direct, and if anything even better on the counter-attack than they were under Rodgers.

&gt; Besides, just look at how Clarke dismantled us on the first day of the season - he knew our players inside out.

Clarke's dismantling of us was through targeting the inherent weaknesses in Rodgers' system, made more vulnerable because it was our first league game and we were still learning and developing.

Why do I think it was targeting the system, not the players?

I mean you wouldn't want to put a child of Jewish ethnicity into a home decorated with Nazi memorabilia, would you? So, the question is simply one of where the ""acceptability"" line should be drawn, is it not? Clearly, we both put UKIP membership on different sides of that line.

And that is all we really disagree on. All the rest is just based on supposition and speculation, because you have no more idea as to whether this couple are *""loving parents""* than I have as to whether they are racists. We both just think there is more *potential* for our own subjective opinions to be correct. You're right that having children with loving parents is preferable to having them in care homes, but you also need to understand that a too liberal approach to fostering could lead to children being raised in hateful family environments, which would be anything *but* preferable.

2) everyone else is Britain is, because of our birth, their subjects. I don't want to be a subject. I want to be a citizen. 
3) the flip side of 1) is that the royal family are not free. Because of their birth they are utterly unable to have a ""normal"" life. Look at how screwed up so many of them are - busted marriages, motherless kids. They're born in a goldfish bowl. It's not fair. I dunno whether they feel the money power and privilege adequately make up for it, they'd have to decide that. But it's not fair. Whenever a new baby is born to the royal family I always feel sorry for it. 
4) the institution of the monarchy belongs to the middle ages. In the middle ages all countries were governed by some kind of hereditary ruler. But we have a better system now, democracy. Most countries in the world have shifted from monarchies to democracies and got rid of their royal families. It makes Britain backwards, primitive and anachronistic to hold onto ours. 

I would like Britain to get rid of the royals and become a modern democratic republic. The population of Britain should be citizens, free and equal. The queen and all the other royals would become citizens, same as you and me. They would have the right to vote for the democratic government, but they would no longer get any money from the taxpayer. They could keep their own possessions (they own massive amounts of land and have enormous personal wealth, so they wouldn't be in any hardship). But the wealth and property of ""the crown"" would revert to the nation. Buildings such as Buckingham Palace (which I think belongs to the crown rather than to Elizabeth Windsor personally) could be opened as museums.

While his mother has inarguably done a good job as Queen, that's really not difficult when she gets to decide what it means to be Queen. Charles will certainly be a very different monarch, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.


I can't help but feel that - to remain relevant in the 21st century - the monarch will need to carry out duties that an 86-year-old woman and her 91-year old husband just can't do.

Since taking the throne in 1952, her style of monarchy has barely changed. She's aloof, distant, and isn't there to take part. She's very good at not taking part- simply turning up and representing the Monarchy is all that's required of her.

The younger Royals - Charles included - have a more hands-on approach. It might make them look silly, but it also makes them more easily to relate to as people. When Prince Charls visits BBC Scotland, [he reads the weather](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54FKp4Ib4Kk). Put Prince Charles on a 1980s dancefloor, and you've got embarrassing footage of a future King [attempting to breakdance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTUrc-De2xY).

true,[deleted],null,null,"It depends. Nobody is going to consent to a union until economic prosperity and parity is achieved, that way neither side feels they are carrying an unfair tax burden to support the other (this is what happened when Germany was reunited, and many West Germans still resent the economic weakness of the East taking up large amounts of their taxpayers money).

So, I don't think the canton idea would work, unless another party with the willingness and ability to provide financial assistance appeared (perhaps an American administration hoping to claim that they solved the Irish problem).

In terms of direct benefits, the combinations of our healthcare, tourism and energy sectors would be good. People in Donegal could come to Derry for urgent or recurring care, rather than Galway or elsewhere. 
There's already large degrees of cooperation in these areas, but full integration might yield more success.

If the good healthcare in the North became an all-Ireland situation then many Southerners might support the new union, given the obvious benefits. The tradeoff would be that the North could benefit from the energy resources that the south has offshore. It's arguable that the Celtic tiger has set the South up as more friendly to large businesses, so the taxation and pay from those large businesses would be spread over all of Ireland, not just the South.

I think if the two countries were joined then all of our successes and failures would become shared. We'd have all of eachother's good points, but we'd still have to deal with the massive problems that we both have.",0,1353850917,null,0,false,0,c76gf1d,t3_13pyt7,t1_c76gf1d,t1_c76fpo8,null,1430494651,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3

Benitez got the best of Torres at Liverpool and will be expected to do so again at Chelsea.  

* Daniel Sturridge is a doubt, while John Terry and Frank Lampard are still out injured.  

* As there has been a change in managerial staff at Stamford Bridge, there could be some changes made to the usual starting XI.

**Manchester City**

* Vincent Kompany was seen leaving the Etihad on crutches after the midweek draw with Real Madrid in the Champions League, and it is not yet clear how bad the injury he sustained was.

* Gael Clichy missed that mach with a foot injury and may not return in time to play at Stamford Bridge.

- Downing's been invisible going forward, and as a result we're far more threatening down the right flank than the left.

- Henderson originally began as the most attacking midfielder, with Gerrard shuttling; sometime during the first half, this was swapped around, and we were much better going forward as a result. Henderson's got a great engine, but like Downing, was fairly poor going forward.

- Gerrard's defensive work rate is suspect - it's been said before, but in this match where we have less than 50% possession, it really shows. 

- Hernandez apart, Swansea haven't been too threatening - they're taking surprisingly long to transition from defending to attacking. I'll be worried if/when they introduce Nathan Dyer, because he's probably the most likely to encourage them to play more direct or at a higher tempo than right now.

true,Babinian,null,null,"Hi there, I'm actually the Law Subject Ambassador at a small college in Oxford so it's basically my job to help out applicants with your sorts of questions. (Not Brasenose unfortunately). 

Recommendations:

 - read ""Letters to a Law Student"" by McBride. Helps a lot, sometimes with interview stuff (words, layout of legal system etc)
 - go on the supreme court website and try to read a case or two and note down the main facts and the reasons behind the judge's decision. This simple exercise is what I do all day every day as a law student (that and reading articles about court decisions), especially in the first year. If it doesn't bore you to death or prove impossible to do, then congratulations - most colleges' interviews won't be too bad.

Law interviews at my college consist entirely of being given a case and told to read it for half an hour, then asked a lot of questions about it. They will ask you to defend your views on the case, identify what's going on in the case and challenge pretty much everything you say. The point of this is to make you stand up for yourself and play with ideas. Don't be afraid to stick by something you say, but also don't stick to something which is evidently wrong just to be contrary.

There will be one question on your personal statement - make sure everything you have said in it is true and you can chat about it (so if you haven't actually read a bit of Descartes or Lord Bingham or whatever, then do it now!).

All they are looking for is an ability to analyse and argue, and someone who will not be intimidated by high-level written language. If you can, try to relax and enjoy the opportunity to be challenged by high-level academics in their own field.

Side note: doesn't matter what college you apply to since all law applications are decided centrally, so if Brasenose is full but you meet Oxford standards for applicants you will be pooled to a different college - blanket rule.

First Doctor, Ian, Barbara, and Susan/Vicki: they all seemed to really get a long and love working together. Ian and Barbara by themselves probably had the best chemistry between any two companions.

Second Doctor and Jamie: partners-in-crime fun. Jamie was always loyal, even to the end. Fun fact: he wasn't originally supposed to be a companion,  but his contract allowed for a few more stories. He was also supposed to leave at some point and be replaced by a new companion called Nik, but he decided to stick around. Glad he did.

Third Doctor and Jo: very sweet.

Fourth Doctor and Sarah Jane/Romana II: haven't seen a lot of this era yet, but why I have seen shines because of these two (and Romana I of course, but not so much the chemistry).

Not sure about Fifth or Sixth. I've seen a little bit of Five and while he's very kind, none of his companions seem to care. Besides, it was pretty crowded, and Teagan and Adric were always yelling at each other.

Seventh Doctor and Ace

Didn't the Eighth Doctor have someone really awesome in the audio adventures? Charley Pollard? I've heard about their chemistry.

Nine and Rose, and I might say Ten and Rose as well. Unlike all the other multi-year Doctors, he never had a companion stay more than one year.

Swansea should have gotten the ball to Dyer more, because whenever he did have the chance to run at Downing he had the better of him.

On the other hand, switching the 3-man midfield in an attempt to go for the win actually made us too open defensively, allowing Swansea to dominate the last 10 or so minutes; Shelvey was pushed further forward than either Gerrard or Henderson had been, leaving Gerrard and Allen to do much of the defensive work - not ideal given how poor Gerrard's defensive work rate had been throughout the game, and Allen not having the best game of his Liverpool career either.

I don't trust this woman to act impartially as she has shown she is ignorant of the policies of a reasonably large UK political party and is acting out of her biassed political opinions.

Also, race is not the only thing that people discriminate against - i'd say class is the bigger and far more subtle problem in the UK.

Anyway, I'll tell you why I don't like the idea. Because it's a stupid notion from an american tv producer who though we wouldn't be able to relate to the character if he was an alien, ignoring the fact that people had been relating to him for over 30 years and also that it's the role of the companion to be the human one that the viewer relates to.

Basically it doesn't fit, especially the way it's revealed to the viewers, he just blurts it out and then he's talking about shoes or something. But also within the context of the show. Time lords are very snooty about the lesser races, how did he get into the academy if he's not even gallifreyan?
 There were also questions about how he could regenerate and pilot the tardis, but River can do that and she's got two human parent which puts an interesting slant on it (that brings up a couple of other questions, can she pilot any tardis or just the one she happened to be conceived in, could she live 400 years without regenerating like a proper gallifreyan?).

No where does he seek to tell the turth. He seeks to mess with upset and irritate. No body ever calls him a truth seeker, he himself is very adamant about how he plays a character on stage. If you watch this apart from the little bit at the end, it's all mocking the fact people are seeing as this sort of thing. While he does make some nice points they tend to be asides. His main comedy lies in sending up the pompousness of beinging the truth to the people style comedians and he is the but of his jokes.  

It's more that Stewart Lee has a form of comedy that you really need a certain patience (if you aren't familiar with him) and most importantly understanding and appreciation of the art of comedy. The people who I know that don't like him mostly have a terrible taste in comedy (and other cultural things). The thing is to get comedy you have to listen to it and evolve your tastes (some of this is simply linked to intelligence so some people will never get it) and you grow up and begin to realise why the chuckle brothers or michael macintyre aren't funny but laurel and hardy are geniuses and your tastes evolve to become both more personal and appreciate the difference between good and bad comedy.

There are terrible comedians with popular appeal but it's all shit, your Mcintyres your Peter Kays, your john Bishops, your Mrs Brown's Boys etc and comedy fans hate them because they find it lazy and uninteresting.

Then you have the comedians with really broad appeal with both popular appeal and comedy fan/critical appeal. Your Rhod Gilberts, Greg Davies's, Russell Kanes, Tim Minchins etc. 

Then you have the ones that are really divisive, liked by critics and comedy nerds (or even only particular sub sets of comedy nerds) they can be wildly popular (a la Ross Noble) but don't appeal or often alienate themselves from mainstream audiences in this is Stewart Lee, Tim Key, etc etc


I wouldn't use Stewart Lee as the touch paper because even comedy fans don't always like him, I'd use something like Mrs Brown's Boys (easily the most popular sitcom in the last decade) because if you watch that, you have no taste, what you find funny isn't funny etc. If you like it you haven't got a grown up taste in stuff. It's the equivalent of listening to some generic but really popular music chart shit.

Donna's character was a semi-good one; an unlucky poor woman, quite clumsy, who just happens to exist around a rift in time and space, dragging the Doctor to her over and over again. She grows useful and eventually, absorbs the Doctor-energy so she becomes the Doctordonna, but not being able to bear it with her human body, she loses her memory and goes back to her poor life, without even remembering. (Afterwards, the Doctor slips her a winning lottery ticket, and there's Wilf, yada yada yada). Technically, a strong character.

Then there is Catherine Tate. Oh, I love Catherine Tate. Lauren Cooper is fantastic. Tate tops my list of favourite comediennes, and fuck it, she even called her kid Erin which is a wonderful name. She's done some great work, I love her (albeit irritating yet funny) voice, yeah. She seems to be a bit daft at times, but it's cute and funny, I can appreciate it.

But god damn it, who thought of combining the two?

There's this great chemistry between Tennant and Tate (that sounds like a lawyer firm) that I can truly feel through Doctor Who, but not as much as I feel it in all of the other works they've done together. Their relationship is great, both on and off screen. But still... other than that, I didn't think Tate was a fit choice for the role of Donna. Donna needed to be more clumsy, to be cuter, to be quieter even? That's all, of course, my personal opinion.

As for the gambling comparison, I would argue the majority of people  who gamble are moderate gamblers, as most drinkers are moderate. 

A price hike is likely to deter the MAJORITY of people from buying as much booze. Agreed, hardcore alcoholics will get booze any way they can, but such policies are targeted at the whole nation. 

The huge hike in the price of cigarettes over the last decade or so has also coincided with a drop in  the number of smokers - I don't think that's a fluke.

true,NFB42,smith,Smith,"This is entirely my personal opinion, but I'm dead set against it simply because it is such a cliche. The 'half-human/half-something else' has been done to death. Having the Doctor be fully alien is interesting, it sets up for conflict with his companions and it makes him more unique. Turning him into yet another character struggling between his human and 'alien' half would be a down-grade imo.

Also the reason you mentioned, this is again just my personal opinion but I'm also tired of these 'racist' explanations for why characters behave in a certain way. A character shouldn't need some kind of genetic or familial connection to care or like a certain people or species.  It really annoys me how many shows seem to suggest that there has to be something in it for you before you're allowed to care about the plight of others different from you. Not that I disagree on it making sense or anything, but I find the Doctor much more interesting and unique if he just happened to care about humanity, without being in any way part-human himself.

Also on a technical note. I'm certain that in the canon of the 8th Doctor movie the half-human comment was meant entirely seriously. But in a show as long as Doctor Who there's going to be a ton of concepts that the head writers at the time thought was cool, but which later writers chose to abandon.

SuperJan is looking like Bale used to...a solid left back with a real attacking threat as well. I know he's more comfortable in the middle, but I'm loving him playing on the wingback lately.

Huddlefro...love ya, but stop the mile long shots, dude.

Lloris looking very solid as usual. We haven't challenged Jaaskelainen nearly enough considering the number of chances we've had. 

Defoe's brilliant strike! Another one who's been fairly invisible aside from that moment and his foolish yellow. Hammers back line seems to be doing a decent job of closing up any space he's been finding...or he's just not finding the space.

Overall our entire team *cannot be afraid to just* **shoot**. Shelvey had a great shot that so very nearly crept into the corner. Gerrard is more than capable of things like that, but he had a weak shot with his weaker foot which hardly tested the keeper. There were plenty of opportunities for Gerrard to let one fly, but nope. He passes sideways. And then Henderson passes sideways. And then Sterling gets the ball, tries to beat his man, can't, and then passes it back sideways. This goes on and on and on until a Swansea player makes a tackle/interception and away they go. Sterling had a few shots, but he desperately needs to work on shooting with his weaker foot, or he shouldn't try at all.

Everything is true in it so I'll look over it again.

A few questions about the academics-side of the interview, if you don't mind:

1. How useful is knowledge of current affairs going to be? I haven't kept up to date with the news of the past year or so (have a backlog of news magazine that I could read) because I was focusing more on academics (coursework, ps, ...) so unfortunately I have neglected that side.

2. I've also heard about how the interviewers will ask you about what you studied in your school syllabus and talk about that. Does this happen?

Also, unrelated to the interviewing process, but what should I wear when I turn up to the interview? I have heard opinion from both sides of the spectrum. Some people say that Law and PPE students should / usually turn up in suits, while others say that you would be overdressed if you wore a suit / shirt / tie / black trousers.

**MOTM - Mikel.** Great game, very strong. Thought he made some great tackles, held the midfield and stopped a lot of City's offensive. Not a clue why he came off, but Romeu wasn't entirely shit so it didn't cost us badly. **EDIT:** I have since been told he was subbed off through injury. Shame, he was having a great game.

**Torres has more energy.** Much more effort from the Spaniard than in recent games but still not the ability/form we've all been crying for. Maybe Rafa *can* get the best out of him, but I question what his best is nowadays.

**Great game from Dave.** Though Dave was brilliant down the right wing. Some good defence and offering a lot to our (not so fantastic) attack. Already looking a lot better than when he started with us and is looking good to take Ivan's place if he is moved inside like today.

**Best defence yet.** Considering the attacking options and ability City have, this was a brilliant defensive display compared to our recent games ( 2-1 WBA anyone? 3-0 Juve? :( ) Considering JT is still out and Cahill didn't play, I thought it was something to be proud of.

**Beware the curse of the 0-0!** Game after game of 0-0 is worse than 2 wins and a loss, and I fear we may become too defensive. Rafa never won the PL but was quite successful cup wise and this is because defensive draws are a lot more useful in cups than in the league. Although I was quite happy with the 0-0 today considering our defence has been poor lately, Rafa has literally just got here and we were playing City, I really hope we develop into an attacking team rather than a defensive one.

The argument is that Tottenham supporters have expropriated the term ""Yid"" on an explicitly anti-racist basis, i.e. by identifying themselves with the Jewish community and making those roots a part of their identity. That is *exactly why* they were targeted by the fascists.

This is what the author means when he says the fascist thugs have understood the actual meaning/motivation behind the label Tottenham fans have claimed for themselves better than these lawyers have.

&gt;It shows how empty liberal anti-racism is, obsessed with 'bad words' over the actual relationship and context of the people who use them.

What this means is it is not the word ""Yid"" that is bad, it is the material context and reality of how it is used. 

The better known example is the difference between ""nigger"" used in wire-esque ghetto comradeship and when used as a racist slur, with all the history of persecution and violence that implies.

**EDIT:** this comes from [another blog](http://www.sami-bin-raab.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/we-will-always-be-yids.html) by a Jewish Tottenham fan, and clarifies the origin of the label:

&gt;Tottenham (like most teams in London but more so because of the Jewish communities of South Tottenham &amp; Stamford Hill) had a big Jewish following.  This meant Tottenham got a lot of anti-Semitic chanting by rival fans and at times, even Zieg-heiling &amp; hissing to imitate gas chambers.

Donna is one of the few characters that I started out (much like you) not liking. I didn't actively hate her, (because, let's face it, she's a slightly annoying tertiary character on a TV show. Not really enough to get me boiled), but I did acknowledge that she was pretty difficult to like and she certainly was jarring after the loss of Rose.

But Doctor Who did something that I respect phenomenally. It took a character I didn't like, even actively disliked and **gradually** made them a character I *loved*.

There was no 180. There wasn't a sudden ""turn good"" moment like say Lionel Luthor from Smallville. This was a feat I've only seen in one other show, in the form of Breaking Bad's Skyler White. A character made a slow trudge from being a terribly annoying burden to a realistic troubled character that you could root for.

I think people's opinion of Donna reflects how willing they are to changing their minds about a show entirely. People who form ideas and prejudices early, who do things like hold a fan ""ship"" long after it was denounced by the show.

true,thatstevelord,cnty-england,AmazingBlazingBasingstoke,"As with Smoking, special interest groups have targeted alcohol but lack the courage of their convictions to actually come out and push for the goal they want (which varies by group between an arbitrary definition of responsible drinking and an absolute ban on alcohol).

Pubs have been hit hard by the smoking ban. There's an argument to be had that the pubs can't compete with supermarket pricing, which sells some booze at a loss to clear stock or to get people in (such as around new year, before christmas or around major sporting events). The minimum pricing will not make supermarket alcohol more expensive than going to the pub, and as such will not increase peoples' use of pubs.

As it stands, young people tend to drink at home first then go into town. Even younger people tend to buy in a group, so the individual increase in price per unit will mean either a change in habits or an increase in the amount people chip in. Setting a minimum price will not have a significant effect on anti-social behaviour from these groups as they'll accept it as a cost of getting hammered.

Minimum pricing will have no impact on pubs, bars and clubs in the problem areas of town, therefore these areas will continue to be problem areas. If minimum pricing meant that the cost of drinking at home was more than drinking out, more people might come out earlier in the night rather than getting half cut at home first but as that cost isn't the same or greater it's a moot point.

People who have serious alcohol dependencies will not care about minimum pricing. If they can't afford it they'll steal it or do something else like drink alcohol sourced from elsewhere, same as they do now. Increasing the cost of alcohol makes it more likely that these people cannot afford to buy alcohol and will resort to more high risk means of obtaining it. Thus minimum pricing on the grounds of encouraging dependents to drink less is counterintuitive.

Poor people who get blotto on cheap supermarket lager/cider will have to pay more to get blotto on cheap supermarket piss. The supermarkets will find a way to reduce the impact of this with potentially mixed results. We've already seen this in Scotland with the multi-buy legislation. In the meantime people who get blotto on cheap supermarket lager/cider will continue to pay for the cheapest option or find an alternative. Thus any assertion that minimum pricing will encourage more responsible drinking by these people is a masturbatory exercise at best. We've seen this with smoking. As the government increased duty on fags people bought black market fags smuggled into the UK or continued to smoke and just spent a higher percentage of their salary on fags.

The only people that will be impacted by minimum pricing will be responsible drinkers who can't afford to buy expensive drinks, e.g. someone on the dole who's saved up to have a couple of beers once a fortnight with a film. Depending on the pricing this may affect their ability to afford to drink cheap booze. It's not clear how many people there are in this category (poor but responsible cheap shit drinkers).

Minimum pricing is likely to have an overall effect on alcohol duty revenues as people adjust their drinking habits and (more likely) drinks manufacturers adjust their recipes to avoid getting hit. We've seen this before with budget changes in spirits such as high street Gin and Vodka which are much lower in strength than they used to be. If instead of implementing minimum pricing the government looked into changes in alcohol duty based on duty per unit there may be a way in which the government can increase revenues, change spending behaviours or perhaps both.

So, in conclusion, minimum pricing may have adverse affects on some members of the population but appears to provide no discernible benefit other than to set a floor from which pricing can be raised. It is also likely to have at least a short term effect on duty with a longer term impact as manufacturers and retails identify ways to get around the impact on their profits.

This is why I hate minimum pricing. I also hate the smoking ban for similar reasons (although I don't smoke myself).",0,1353868828,null,0,false,0,c76ju8h,t3_13rd2t,t1_c76ju8h,t3_13rd2t,null,1430496340,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

true,stop-chemistry-time,null,null,"Yes, I should have said that there's no ""known"" memory effect. However, the accumulated scientific knowledge suggests that there isn't.

Consider what a memory effect is proposed to do - it's expected to have some sort of therapeutic action. Now, non-placebo therapeutic action comes about by the interaction of some delivered compound with some biological molecule or system. If homeopathy works, there must be some interaction with ""biology"".

The good news is that water is a chemical. Biology is made up of chemicals. The central mantra of homeopathy is that a diluted substance treats the symptom it would otherwise cause. It's well-known that at sufficient dilution, a homeopathic remedy contains no (or very very few) molecules/atoms of the starting poison. If we accept the central mantra then it follows that homeopathic arsenic must have some property different to homeopathic mistletoe, for example. Since adherents claim that homeopathy has a therapeutic effect, we can design experiments to test whether the ""origin"" of super-diluted solutions has an effect on their chemistry - since they *must* have different chemistry in order to result in differing biological effects. The answer, from experiments, is that water is water...

You might look at this argument and try to dismiss it: ""there must be something about biology or chemistry we don't know that is relevant to this problem"". Fair enough, we don't know everything - so let's think of another way of probing the effect of homeopathy. **Clinical trials**. Assessment of clinical data has found that homeopathy has no effect over placebo in humans. This evidence is incontrovertible - homeopathy has been demonstrated have no therapeutic effect that could not be attributed to a placebo effect.

That's not to say it's worthless. Giving people the opportunity to control their treatment can, apparently, work wonders when it is coupled with a fervent belief in the efficacy of a treatment. But it doesn't mean that there is a biochemical rationale for homeopathy. I'm glad it worked for you in a veterinary setting, but it's hard to conceive a reason other than coincidence.

Finally, you draw reference to ""religious nuts"". It is your argument, in fact, that is reminiscent of religious nutjobbery. *""You can't prove it's impossible[subject to arbitrary boundary conditions which I will use to ignore any evidence against homeopathy] so it*  **must** *be true because I believe in it, whether I can explain it or not and regardless of the balance of overall evidence""*. Your one experience does not trump the scientific facts. Your one experience does not prove the facts wrong. Coincidence is real, and science seeks to explain what is, and what isn't, a true effect.

TL;DR: don't accuse people of having no evidence when there is plenty of evidence against homeopathy which adherents choose to ignore or fail to engage with.",0,1353869333,null,0,1353881605,0,c76jz3g,t3_13quug,t1_c76jz3g,t1_c76jklf,null,1430496395,30,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,30

true,vmos,cyberman,Cyberperson,"Seriously. The concept of a canon relating to a fictional world first arises with sherlock holmes where ""the canon"" referred to the works written by Arthur Conan Doyle himself. He created holmes, he is the authority on what holmes did and didn't do. The deerstalker and the phrase ""elementary my dear watson"" are not part of the Sherlock Holmes canon because they first appeared in the stage play which wasn't written by Doyle.

Now look at Doctor Who. The character was created by a group of people who haven't been involved with the show in decades, it's had a dozen producers and hundreds of writers, and those writers have always been happy to ignore what's gone before for the sake of a good story. Who's the authourity on what is ""canon"" ? Some people say it's the BBC, in which case the eighth Doctor books are canon but the tv movie and audios aren't, there are three ninth doctors and two different Doctors played by Richard E Grant.

Usually when a Doctor Who fan says something ""isn't canon"" what they usually mean is they don't like it.

2. Mazacar is still parked and hasn't found the touch we had at the beginning of the season. Anyone figure this out yet? Time for a Marin switch with Mata/Oscar?

Really? Really?!?!? Now that's bullshit. Watch any of his dvds particularly 90s Comedian and say that again.You would be basically the only person in the country who could say that. Even ignoring his material and style, in terms of pure delivery/stage craft etc he is in a class above almost everyone. 

I don't think Lee remotely cares about Hicks, if you listen to him, he's quite open about his influences and Ted Chippington, Mark E Smith, and many other particularly his former comedy partner Richard Herring weigh far more on his comedy than Hicks ever has, particularly since his return to stand up. Hicks is the preacher, if you will, even in his early stuff (not the Lee and Herring stuff just the solo stuff although they are related) much (although not even close to all) of what Lee does essentially mocks that I'm here to tell you the truth attitude. Mocks the person who claims to be telling the truth by establishing himself as that character and cutting himself down and making himself and his self importance the object of the ridicule. 

There is even a joke he and richard herring make in TMWRNJ in the cress episode where they talk about adverts and the lights cut out and a spot light focuses on them as they bow their head in prayer and Hick's slightly distorted voice echoes out about advertising revelation-like.

Fast forward to today and my towns Uni has a charity based society that had to re-brand itself because parents and media picked up on the fund raising process involving several ""challenge"" bar crawls - again involving heavy drinking.

I'm not saying we should keep illogical laws because they are the status quo at all. 

The law has to appreciate the will of the majority of people because we live in a democracy. This isn't an absolute as the law also has to serve the best interests of the country and its people as well. The law has to strike a balance. 

So what before making a law, we have to consider both what the people want, and what will serve their best interests (as the two aren't always aligned).

So, alcohol, tobacco and weed. 

All three cause serious negative health effects. Alcohol and weed both serious inhibit peoples ability to perform tasks such as driving which can put a great many innocent people at risk. All three are very addictive. All three serve no purpose other than hedonistic pleasure. All three cause cancers, mental health problems, lung and liver diseases and lots of other fun enjoyable things. 

So, if the law was written only the basis of what is best for us, all three would be completely illegal clearly. 

However, the law is not solely concerned with what is best for us, it is also concerned with what we want as a people. 

Now, alcohol and tobacco have always been far more popular in Britain than cannabis, even when cannabis was legal. Alcohol and tobacco have always been mainstays of the British public. Cannabis has not. 

So, taking in to account the will of the people, a large amount of people would like alcohol and tobacco to be legal because they have always enjoyed them. That is the will of the vast majority in this country because alcohol and tobacco have been around here for so long. Therefore, the law permits them because the will of the people is large enough to trump what would serve their best interests. 

Cannabis however has never and still doesn't enjoy the popular support of the people because it has historically never enjoyed popular useage.  Therefore, the will of the people for cannabis doesn't trump what would serve the peoples best interests. Cannabis is therefore illegal.

Why didn't Merlin just tell the truth? Morgana attacked him. That way, suspicion is raised toward Gwen without him having to openly accuse her of being evil.

Raheem didn't have the greatest of games, needs to work on his passing. Still a decent performance, and would have had a fantastic goal if his shot hadn't hit the crossbar. 

Suarez, Agger, Reina and Skrtel all performed well. As did Johnson and Hendo for the most part. Gerrard was having a bit of a 'mare and Allen made quite a few mistakes. 

Don't think Cole or Jonjo made much of a difference when they came on. 

Disappointing but at the same time Swansea are a good side so to get a point there is something to be pleased about and on the plus side it continues our unbeaten run and is another clean sheet. 


What we need; Another striker, Lucas back, another fullback (be it a new LB, or a new RB with Glen moving to the left side full time). I think that's all we need in order to get the results really going our way.

He was largely responsible for the equalizing goal at the end of the match midweek. For his experience, he has been giving the ball away stupidly in dangerous areas as well. When we push him further up the pitch like today, his attacking threat is nonexistant. He doesn't shoot, he doesn't bring the ball forward with pace.

Sad indictment of the state of the nation in my opinion. Of course it means that we will soon be unable to go to war in pretty much any capacity, but one has to ask if it is entirely wise considering upcoming conflicts on resources (ie. Falklands oil). Military research almost always has positive spinoffs in national economic terms. Personally I think it's useful to have something between nuclear deterrents and nothing.

&gt;[“We get pitched loads of animation,” says Channel 4 acting head of comedy Nerys Evans, who commissioned Full English [...] “It’s the sort of thing that people can do in their bedrooms, producing quite bizarre and esoteric stuff. And we usually think: ‘well, we could do that but it wouldn’t cut through, nobody’s going to really come to it.’ So when Jack and Harry came to us with this idea, it was so ambitious – they wanted to make a British version of things like Futurama – we thought that was different, because they were already talking in terms of scale and we were quite intrigued by the idea of a C4 family sitcom anyway, so animation felt like the perfect bedfellow.”](http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/in-depth/behind-the-scenes/in-focus/full-english-channel-4/5048782.article)

&gt; Of the 140,000 Jews who had lived in the Netherlands prior to 1940, only 30,000 survived the war. This high death toll had a number of reasons. One was the excellent state of Dutch civil records: the Dutch state, prior to the war, had recorded substantial information on every Dutch national. This allowed the Nazi regime to determine easily who was Jewish (whether fully or partly of Jewish ancestry) simply by accessing the data.[citation needed]

true,IRONic__MAN,lfc68,,"I think, for our team to perform to its maximum potential, then Gerrard needs to be left on the bench unfortunately. It kills me to even think that, but other players just offer so much more than him. I think Shelvey &amp; Sahin for starters, would have helped us a lot more today. Sahin in terms of ball retention and Shelvey in terms of making those marauding runs into the area and linking up the midfield to attack. Rodgers has a massive decision to make, because he is going to be skeptical about joining a club then removing that clubs legend from the team as it could turn some fans against him.

Also, I think Allen has been on a steady decline for a month or so now, I hope Rodgers has the balls to drop him and give him a kick up the backside. And when Lucas returns he has a massive decision to make, I suspect he will play Lucas, Allen &amp; Gerrard as the midfield trio. Personally, I think Lucas, Sahin &amp; Shelvey would work better together. They would bring more balance.

true,[deleted],null,null,"By materialism, I mean the significance of racist words is not that they are offensive in themselves (they are after all, just words) but the *material oppression* that they are associated with. For example, ""nigger"" is racist because of the historical context of violence, dehumanisation and oppression. There is also the real material inequality that still exists today. 

This is why, btw, ""anti-white racism"" is looked on with scorn. You can be prejudiced against white people, but that is by no means the same thing that black people experience.

So the word itself is not really the problem. Of course words can be offensive, but that is no reason to stop someone saying them.

The liberal response to racism, sexism etc is anti-hate speech legislation[1] and multiculturalism in state policy. Without getting into the minefield of multiculturalism, the former of these is just a fig leaf. The words themselves are not the problem and banning them does *nothing* to help liberate oppressed groups.

true,AluminumFalcon3,lfc12,,"Barca built their play style on the backbone of Xavi-Busquets-Iniesta. In fact when Fabregas was added in last year you could see how he didn't quite fit (which was ok, that was part of the point). That's also apparent this season in which his performance has been OK. But see, Tito uses him to bring a bit of chaos into the side--in fact, that's been exemplified by a bit of a change in style this year for Barca, mixing things up a bit. Not to say that Iniesta isn't ""attacking"", but rather that he's from a different mold than Gerrard, who relied more on explosiveness than, say, dribbling. 

Gerrard did do well at the Euros, but that's because England's play style was more suited to his strengths--crosses and long balls in from outside the box. And he also played farther back for Country than Club, which could explain his better performances (in more a holding role?) But see, I don't know if Gerrard is cut out for that role in a possession based system (as opposed to England's counter attacking 442). That holding mid needs to be good at keeping possession and distributing, as well as playing the *occasional* hollywood ball. And while there is a precedent, not every player can transition to that holding mid role from a more advanced position. 

I hope Gerrard can still be a part of this team, but that means trying him out in the holding role and seeing if he can keep possession well. So far, though, he doesn't seem like a player that would work in establishing this system.

Essentially what they do is kill a fox, or train the dogs to hunt a certain smell that smells very like a fox, then drag it around an area. The ruse is that theyre all just going to follow the dogs running around, and thats where all the fun is at, ""riding around jumping over obstacles"".

However they intentionally drag this scent/carcass through areas where they know foxes are, then when the dogs catch the scent of a live fox and start chasing after it, they have to ""chase after the dogs to try and stop it from killing the fox"" but if it does, its obviously an accident and wasnt their fault.

true,djgrewal,lfc68,,"1) I didn't intend to make anyone feel like an idiot, just in a bad mood, I'll edit that out.

2) I was mentioning the passing statistics because people keep on saying he loses the ball too often, and also our team keeping possession is probably quite a priority, after winning and keeping clean sheets (IIRC BR has often said the team with the majority of possession wins something like 76% of the time).

3) I don't think neither long passes nor pacey runs interfere with the philosophy of the team. From what I understand Rodgers really doesn't mind the players playing long balls if they are certain that they will reach the target, which from Gerrard they usually do. Long balls are only really frowned upon if they are more ""hit-and-hope"". And I agree that when Lucas comes back Gerrard should be more effective, but I still feel that he is usually our best midfield player.",0,1353887908,null,0,false,0,c76p2jg,t3_13s3iz,t1_c76p2jg,t1_c76orqo,null,1430498794,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5
