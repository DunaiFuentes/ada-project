I also largely agree here. Fertility is a big deal and while it shouldn't be tied to one's self worth, it unfortunately is. People shouldn't feel ""broken"" but they do. And it's understandable. And a realistic and precedented situation.

And while I agree that birth and pregancy is a whole way different journey than adoption, that doesn't mean it's *better* than adoption. You have a different journey, not a better one.

Next step was to spray it with bleach with the intent that the bleach would only bleach out the stencil, but we oversaturated the shirt and the bleach bled outwards, creating the ghostly white outline.  

After washing and drying the shirt, the first steps with the stencil were repeated, but instead of spraying with bleach we sprayed the stencil with blue fabric paint, making sure not to over saturate this time! After letting it set up we peeled off the stencil and created the shirt design.

It really was a nice accident, I've received many compliments on it already.

true,Ptylerdactyl,tennant,Tennant,"I guess I'll go against the grain here. I like the show and plan on continuing with it, but a lot of Moffat's stuff disappoints me. The plots make perfect sense until you start really asking, ""Wait, why would *that* happen?""

I started noticing a lot of... lack of internal consistency while rewatching series 5 and 6 in preparation for 7. In Victory of the Daleks, the Robot Scientist basically ignores his only true objective - the reason the daleks built him - by saying, ""Nope, not gonna explode.""

In The Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone, the Weeping Angels are given mysterious new super-powers for no reason except that Moffat decided they weren't scary enough already. Anything that has the image of an angel is now an angel itself (nevermind the fact that they *clearly* didn't work like that the last time). Also, look at them. But don't look at them in their eye area, because then they can invade your memory somehow I guess.

Later, in the opening two-parter of Series 6, Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon, the Doctor is suddenly not only okay with killing again, but actively urges humanity to enact genocide against the Silence - not only on Earth, but wherever humans travel for the rest of time.

Also from Day of the Moon. Last time, the Doctor et.al were in grave peril. They got out, of course, because they always get out. But at least in past two-parters the writing staff at least did us the courtesy of *pretending* it was important to explain. This time all we got was a, ""And... then they ran away.""

Again, from that opener, the whole line of logic linking the girl in the astronaut suit to the Silence was kind of a stretch. ""Why did they suddenly urge humanity to go to the moon? ...Because they needed a space suit.""

Or because they wanted some fancy moon rocks, you don't know. There could be any number of reasons why.

I have more examples (not the least of which is the curious case of Amy's yo-yoing IQ), but you get the idea. I do like some of the thematic elements and the more ""mature"" nature of the show.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"Honestly this is a fairly reasonable response all things considered.

Thing is LFC and THFC are almost always going to compete for the same players.  Just this window for example, we signed Gylfi and Clint who were players you had publicly targeted, LFC brought in Nuri Sahin who about 1/3 of Spurs fans would have preferred as Modders replacement as well as Joe Allen who was also a favorite of Spurs fans.  Both of us were rumored with Llorrente, Damiao, Adam Johnson, and Ba.  In previous windows we had been rumored with Downing, Suarez and tried to sign Charlie Adam.

We will continue to be stepping on each other's toes going forward i think just based on where our teams are and where we want to be.  Both our teams are aiming for Champions league qualifications and both our teams are now for the most part cost conscious.

Currently and in the forseeable future in the EPL whether people want to admit it or not ManU, Man City and Chelsea are the big boys with the wallets to back it up. 

Tottenham, Liverpool (now that Fenway is in charge) and the Gooners are in the next level, we have some money but we are not throwing around huge cash every window, we operate with a wage scale, try to operate within a budget and try to construct competitive teams within a means.

That means it is highly unlikely that all of us will be competing for the signatures of the Falcao, Hulk or Ronaldo's of the world.  However we will be competing for the Isco, Erirkson and Damiao's. Most of the time in an effort to sign them before the big money teams decide that they need to spend huge money on a new toy.

It was clear that, like any number of other types of organic-based attacks (poisons, etc), the Doctor is immune to the nanites. This revelation was pointed out when Amy was found to have the Doctor's wrist thingy on. The Doctor has so much hate inside for the Daleks that if he wasn't immune he would've fell to the nanites almost immediately. And the wristband cured Amy almost immediately after she had it on. As far as the break up, it was building for a while. In the Christmas episode, ""The Doctor, the Widow, and the Wardrobe,"" we saw Amy and Rory fighting. If you watched Pond Life, you saw Rory storm out. For the avid Whovian, the Rormy drama has been building for 8 solid months. 

The real questions to ask are: 

* Where are we in Oswin's story? Are we at the end, the beginning, or somewhere in the middle? Her final reaction upon facing imminent death wasn't exactly one of fear and/or sadness. 

* What happens now that the Daleks don't remember their greatest foe? 

* Is there some significance to the exclaimed, ""Doctor who,"" from the Daleks at the shows close?

* Will the Silence take notice of these recent events, or has Oswin saved him from appearing on their radar?

* Why is the Doctor so calm? He's had his death foretold, and was rather annoyed by the whole idea of ""foretelling"" in the Christmas episode. Yet, now, he is exuberant as ever, which begs the question; 

* What has he been up to since his ""death?""

However, a majority of complaints I've seen we're actually about the fact that they hadn't fully discussed the issue until that point in the episode. It seems like something they should have talked out right away, especially since Rory seemed so understanding about it. Then again, this could be attributed again to the fact that Amy was emotionally unstable from the dilemma and unable to properly convey her sorrow to him and instead lashed other ways.

One word sums it up for me: Catch-22. Yes, the whole divorce subplot was easily short and easily fixed in the episode, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I *don't* want to sit through 5 episodes of bickering to only have them either breakup in the end or realize how much they loved each other all along.

true,iazaroff,pertwee,Pertwee,"First of all, I think the big issue with Amy wasn't her infertility. I will not buy this. We know that Amy is the more adventurous type and Rory is the settle-down guy in their relationship. This is why Rory always felt like the third wheel and wanted it to end as soon as possible, while Amy enjoyed every moment with the Doctor. You can see this in the season premiere as well; Amy wasn't scared at all, she was thrilled that she was back to spacey-timey stuff again. ""Geronimo!"" she said, need I say more?

My older uncle couldn't have any children, he and his wife had a terrible time until they adopted a boy, my lovely cousin. When my parents got married, 10 years after my older uncle, they couldn't have a baby for 5 years (they had 3 boys afterwards). They had an even worse time, my mom gets tears whenever she remembers those years. Maybe I always hated being born in Turkey because of this. I have always thought ""Those in the western countries don't make people feel bad for being infertile and adopting a child, this is so unfair."" Now, as a male, I try to symphatise and understand how a woman feels when she discovers she can't have babies. I imagine it's one of the worst things that could happen to you. But, as you know, there are always other options. There are thousands (perhaps millions?) of children who lost their parents in famine, plague, war, etc. and they are seeking the least bit of attention they might get. A couple who can't have babies and babies who lost their parents, this seems like a perfect match to me.

Back to Amy and Rory, if it was the other way around, I would buy it. If Rory was the one who blamed Amy for being unable to give birth and leave, I would understand it. I would hate Rory but this version is more buyable to me. Amy can't have babies, so she kicks Rory out? What the ..? Rory is totally OK with this fact, all he wants is a quiet and peaceful life with the love of his life, whether or not they have babies. Amy is obviously using this as an excuse to get the Doctor's attention. And then she gets even worse by claiming that ""giving up Rory was worse than waiting for 2000 years"", that's just illogical to me. Speaking of logic, this is how Amy sounds to me:

*I want to be with you and have your babies. I can't have your babies so I will lose you as well.*

I liked Amy from the very first appearence she made in the show, but this episode has grown a great deal of anger towards her in me.

true,elbruce,wardr,Hurt,"&gt; It was clear that, like any number of other types of organic-based attacks (poisons, etc), the Doctor is immune to the nanites. 

If that were the case, he would have given her his wristband the very moment that he knew she didn't have one, instead of letting her get to hallucinatory levels of conversion before doing that.  Amy was pretty fucked up for a while there, and it's not like the Doctor to let his companion suffer that much when he could sacrifice himself immediately - *unless* he's more worried that he could be used as a weapon (which in this case, if he was vulnerable, he would be).

&gt;Where are we in Oswin's story? Are we at the end, the beginning, or somewhere in the middle?

There are six possibilities:

1. This is the same actress playing two different characters, no relation.

2. Both characters do have some relation.

3. The Doctor will pick her up before this point in her timeline and then leave her to this fate.  She didn't remember him because of the effect that Dalek-ification had on her memories.

4. The Doctor will pick her up before this point in her timeline and then do something (yet to be determined) to prevent her from suffering this fate.  Maybe this was a ganger, or maybe the events of this entire episode will be nullified.

5. The Doctor, who is ""very good at teleporting"" did some cross-teleport thing to bring her into the TARDIS, and they'll deal with getting her a non-Dalek body later on.

6. She put her mind into the nanoparticles that got into the Doctor's body, and they'll deal with getting her another body later on.

&gt; Her final reaction upon facing imminent death wasn't exactly one of fear and/or sadness.

""Remember me"" (glances at the camera).  That might very well be a purely ""meta"" thing directed at the audience, since the actress will come back later.  A ""nudge/wink"" at the fans, rather than something meaningful within the world of the show.  Of the possibilities mentioned above, the most likely to me seem to be numbers 2 (I'd say 1, but Moffat leaves no open end untied) or 6 (if she continues from this episode to companion status as the same character).

&gt; What happens now that the Daleks don't remember their greatest foe?

They start to become treated less as an ""if any of them exist, the whole universe is doomed"" threat and more on line with other lesser/occasional enemies (Cybermen, Sontarans, etc).  This would allow future episodes to use them as needed as bad guys, without having to choose between ""the Daleks are extinct, we are safe"" vs. ""some Daleks exist, we are all doomed,"" as it's been in the past.  They're out there, they're sometimes dangerous, other times just lurking in the background.  That seems to be what this episode is designed to re-tool them towards.

&gt; Is there some significance to the exclaimed, ""Doctor who,"" from the Daleks at the shows close?

*On the fields of Trenzalore, at the fall of the eleventh, when no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer, a Question will be asked, a question that must never, ever be answered: ""Doctor Who?""*

The fact that the Daleks are driven *en masse* to ask this question"" may become significant later on.

In that light, it's interesting that the entire Dalek Empire is now repeatedly asking exactly that question.

&gt; Will the Silence take notice of these recent events, or has Oswin saved him from appearing on their radar?

I don't think anybody but the Daleks and the Doctor's friends would have known about what happened in this episode.

&gt; Why is the Doctor so calm? He's had his death foretold, and was rather annoyed by the whole idea of ""foretelling"" in the Christmas episode. Yet, now, he is exuberant as ever, which begs the question; what has he been up to since his ""death?""

Hopefully a lot.  Nevertheless, the remaining prophecy (regarding the Question) isn't nearly as dire as the time-locked death that he already successfuly navigated last season.

It has never been explored since, but the events at Demon's Run, Lake Silencio and the upcoming Question that can never be answered all seem to be heading towards explaining that one event, along with the ensuing cracks in the walls that started everything for the 11th Doctor.

I just feel like Moffat is leading us all to a giant Retcon/Rewind moment similar to the Master's paradox in season 3, where the end and beginning are creating a self-sustaining loop until the Doctor breaks it and then time goes on normally. Maybe he'll make the 11th Doctor the Doctor that never happened, and he will regenerate into the 12th Doctor at the end, but to the rest of the universe it will look like he went from 10 to 12.

Being told you are infertile is a pretty huge deal. River Song is biologically their child, but they didn't get to raise her. And I know everyone is saying ""adoption"" but really it isn't that simple. a) because there are emotional issues around having your own biological child as opposed to adopting one and b) because adopting a child isn't like going to the pound to pick out a puppy and actually it can be hard to adopt. For whatever reason, the Ponds may be ineligible. 

I think it's a pretty normal, if irrational, reaction to basically lose the plot a little bit when told you can never have kids.

true,elbruce,wardr,Hurt,"Moffat has spent the last two years making us give a shit about Rory and Amy's relationship, and then he blew all of that off in a single off-season.  Rory guarded the box containing her for over 2,000 years.  When faced with two perfect identical realities, she committed suicide rather than live in one where he was dead.  Now I'm supposed to expect that such a grand, vast, romantic love can be torn apart by the inability of either party to just say ""let's adopt?""

The problem with this part is that it's something that could either be a ""foreshadowing"" flag regarding something that'll be addressed later, or just bad writing.  And considering how bad that conversation went, I'm not sure I actually give a shit any more, at least not enough to watch more scenes involving their bullshit.  Mind you, I'm still hoping it wasn't just bad writing.  But the way they managed to fix everything after one conversation kind of suggests that.

Other possibilities to be mentioned:

1. Rory &amp; Amy only work really well under action/adventure pressure.  The slow grind of normal/real life is more dangerous to relationships than any extraterrestrial enemy.  This fits in with the whole ""Doctor is impressed by humans"" theme, whereby he is in awe of our ability to live like normal people (for some reason).  It also fits into the end of their conversation where they lock lips basically on a dare to die together.

2. Amy never so much explained to Rory that she was becoming distant due to her ""he deserves children"" concern, and just started treating him like total shit (even more so than usual).  This seems like something she might do, and fits in with what she said.  I still have difficulty believing they never had a truly honest conversation about it before now; I'm sorry, but no couple gets to divorce filing based on infertility without talking about the infertility at some point before that.  Besides, sometimes I start to wonder if Rory wouldn't be better off with a woman who didn't habitually treat him like something she scraped off her shoe.  I'm sure there are plenty out there.

3. Some enemy of the Doctor is using some form of mind control to break up Rory and Amy.

Between ""time can be rewritten"" and ""the doctor lies"" there's no need for continuity between scenes, yet alone between seasons. I love ""Bill and Ted"", but if Doctor Who has to become a time travel adventure (as opposed to it being a mcguffin to explain why each story can be on a different planet or in a different time) then I would like it to be *slightly* less paradoxy.

""Blink"" was fine. The pandorica thing? I'll give him once. Then he followed that up with *another* round of ""look a paradox broke the universe, but everything is fixed again"".

This annoys me.

&gt; We still don't know who that voice in the TARDIS was, and I think that Moffat's just forgotten about it.

Either some season soon is going to be the most amazing television event of the millennium and plot twists from the last 3 years will be resolved, or we're never going to get an explanation for that because ""time can be rewritten"" means it never happened and we were silly for wanting an explanation.

I could tell that he just didn't know how to break up a relationship that we had been in for 9 years. But he wanted his own kids. That is very important to him. I would have left him to make it easier for him. I might have even made up an affair or something. So that he wouldn't feel like shit for leaving me when I couldn't control the miscarriages an I was hurting too. I was even planning to. So I understand Amy doing what she did.

While others have done this before (Amy for instance appeared in the Pompeii episode as a supporting character), it doesn't mean that she's supposed to be a different person. In Amy's case, that was the 10th Doctor, and it was clear that these were two different story lines. Oswin, the next companion, was clearly meant to be introduced in this episode. She was the ""surprise"" Moffat was so excited about. Personally, if I wanted to go crazy here, I'd imagine that it has some impact on the larger story arc. He wants to save her from that terrible future, so, he attempts to, but doing so will also revert history to a point where the Daleks remember him, causing all kinds of ramifications (Time Wars, The Oncoming Storm, The Predator, etc.) which could be part of the Silence is trying to stop.

But she apparently had never before outright asked him (or let him tell her) whether he'd rather have her specifically or someone else who could (whether biologically or psychologically) have kids.  In fact, that question wasn't even asked or answered in this episode.  His opinion regarding the relationship isn't treated as important, and this is consistent with her general treatment of him throughout the relationship (which IMO is a bigger issue between them).

I also understand that the breakup of a relationship after the loss of a baby is so high that it's about as instinctual as what makes people fall in love with each other in the first place.  Parents who lose their children almost always drift apart.  It's like our genes tell us ""that person is now unattractive"" after a failure to raise a child, much in the same way they tell us that a child or sibling isn't attractive.  And I certainly don't count River's existence as properly satisfying the child-raising experience in that regard.  But that information isn't what I got from the show.  

In response to the ""they'll cover it later"" retort, I'm not sure if I can be invested enough in their relationship to sit through it after all this.  They kind of missed the window here for me giving a shit about whether they'll stay together.  Moffat spent two years making me care about Amy &amp; Rory, and less than one episode ripping it all apart and putting it back together, and I'm supposed to be cool with that?

The fact remains - after all they've been through, they got all the way to signing final divorce papers without once having a truly honest conversation about why they were breaking up.  As someone who's been divorced, I find this to be merely ridiculous.  Not tragic, not a romantic missed opportunity, just laughably impossible.  You simply don't get to that point without having every possible conversation that exists to be had, and having exhausted every option regarding your relationship.

Right but try to think about it. When the doctor was in the library, the Vashta Nerada started taking over suits rather than keep trying to ""eat"" people the old fashioned way. 

Now, skipping most of the story line when it comes to the doctor and overcoming the ""silence in the library"". We know those vashta nerada are at least a few hundred years old, if not thousands. We also know that some of them (if not all) are smart enough to access the main computer and completely understand something about a single subject almost instantly ( in this case the doctor ). 

Now when the doctor said ""look me up"" they backed off. Most people would assume it was because they were afraid of him, but they did give him a time limit. Maybe, just maybe they weren't afraid of him. Maybe they looked him up and realized this one guy fought the most dangerous races in the universe, kept them under control and saved hundreds (of millions) if not billions of planets with trillions of lives on each one. Now I don't know about you, but if the SAVIOR of my food supply showed up, doing his thing, I personally would help him long before getting in his or her way. And the reason they (the vashta nerada) backed up in such a hostile way was because they were smart enough NOT to let the doctor know of the fact I just mentioned. 

Which brings me to my last point. I'm 90% sure that as the people were being teleported back onto the planet, the offspring of the ""uber"" vashta nerada were waiting to reattach themselves to others in order to be ""rescued"" and transported to other words, hence spreading and ensuring the survival of their race. After hundreds/thousands of years in humanities pinnacle of knowledge, they've learned to adapt and become a more serious enemy, even though they don't kill as many people anymore. Kind of like the weeping angels who made everyone feel safe through the walkie talkies (for half an episode mind you) until the doctor figured out the truth. And never even mind all the angels along the way. 

Personally I think if they kept/keep it along these lines, future enemies/bad guys will be less about ""how bad they are"" and brute force, and more about whit, intelligence and survival skills. 

Which would kind of explain the intelligence level of the new companion and might mean that it's not about the doctor outsmarting ""enemy x"" anymore. He might have to do it twice, three times while completely thinking out of the box. Which could be great, because it would mean that simply being a timelord isn't good enough anymore.

&gt;My neighbour has installed a CCTV camera and it is pointing towards my house/garden. Is this a breach of the Data Protection Act?

&gt;If your neighbour’s camera is installed on their residential property and being used for their own personal domestic use, they are unlikely to be breaching  the Data Protection Act. This is because the use of CCTV cameras for domestic security purposes is exempt from the data protection principles. This applies when a person uses CCTV to protect their home from burglary, even if the camera overlooks the street or other areas near their home. If your neighbour is using CCTV for business purposes they will need to comply with the Act. If you are concerned about the use of domestic CCTV it may be worth contacting your local police. For more information, contact our helpline or read our topic guide about CCTV.

Anyway, that makes it even weirder. What is Moffat trying to accomplish with this? It doesn't feel like a nice bonus for people who've already seen the episode. Because, like I said, it adds nothing to the plot. The only way I could see it being beneficial would be if it was used as a promo or if it was linked to a future episode. As you pointed out, the former isn't what they did. But the latter makes no sense either. Because in the episode it was clearly stated that that lady managed to get a message to the Doctor.

Not at all. You can do resits. You can go to college and redo the whole thing, which may actually be a better learning environment for you than school was.

If they give you a hard time at college, tell them you are happy to resit the exam if they really need you to.

It will not happen overnight. **It has been compounded by our own mistakes in a difficult first two years of ownership.** It has been a harsh education, but make no mistake, the club is healthier today than when we took over.   

It's good to see that they're willing to admit that and not hide away from that fact.

&gt; Spending is not merely about buying talent. **Our ambitions do not lie in cementing a mid-table place with expensive, short-term quick fixes** that will only contribute for a couple of years.

Unfortunately, they follow up with something that's either been wrongly written, or is definitely spin in the form of a false dichotomy; why is a mid-table place even part of the question at all, and why is expensive short-term quick fixes tied to a mid-table place?

&gt; We will build and grow from within, buy prudently and cleverly and never again waste resources on inflated transfer fees and unrealistic wages. We have no fear of spending and competing with the very best but we will not overpay for players.

I'm completely OK with that, but it requires there to be 'plan B' signings so that if a certain deal falls through because of an excessive valuation, the playing squad isn't left understaffed, as is the case right now. I also still maintain their valuation of players is too heavily affected by age.

*(Sidenote: It's also interesting that Nuri Sahin is talked about as part of building for the future, and more interesting that Assaidi is referred to as a young potential star rather than a starter in the way Borini is.)*

Indeed, but my analogy was to illustrate that 'wealthy' means different things to different people - you're really trying to justify 'you have this, I don't, therefore I have a right to take it'.

No, I was illustrating how flexible your definition of 'wealth' is and how a) that can subsequently be reduced to a packet of crisps and b) being worse off does *not* give you have the right to pick and choose what you'd like to take from someone else.

true,daveduckman,null,null,"Words words words. Words without action.

FSG is far better than Hicks/Gillet at playing the PR game, but there's a growing divide between the rhetoric and the actions which makes me question what our new owners actually seek to achieve.

&gt; but that was not through any lack of desire or effort on the part of all of those involved. They pushed hard in the final days of the transfer window on a number of forward targets and it is unfortunate that on this occasion we were unable to conclude acceptable deals to bring those targets in

This only seems to reinforce that Rodgers wanted Dempsey, Ayre bidded for Dempsey, and they the two of them together were hamstrung by the unwillingness of the owners to fork out the 1-2mil extra being asked by Fulham. Whether the owners were making a principled stand against wasteful spending from Rodgers or LFC were making a principled stand against Fulham's extortion, the point remain that the biggest loser from this debacle is Liverpool FC. For the sake of spare change (relatively speaking) we have left our squad unbelievably thin and seem to have forfeited any real challenge for a top 4 spot this season. What about the opportunity cost in that?


&gt; The transfer policy was not about cutting costs. It was - and will be in the future - about getting maximum value for what is spent so that we can build quality and depth.

Once again words without meaning. Last year, our two biggest failings on the pitch were lacking depth in attack and lacking a clinical finisher. In both those respects, we have gone drastically backwards from the quality we had last year, and the justification throughout has been to improve our wage bill. I have no problem moving on overpaid players past their prime, but only if that money saved is reinvested. Only highly creative accounting can explain the outlay we've made this year compared to our usual operating transfer budget and savings in wages and say we've actually *invested* in the squad.

&gt; We are avowed proponents of UEFA's Financial Fair Play agenda that was this week reiterated by Mr Platini - something we heartily applaud. We must comply with Financial Fair Play guidelines that ensure spending is tied to income.

Thankfully FFP won't be an issue for LFC so long as we continue to miss out on champions league football.


&gt; Finally, I can say with authority that our ownership is not about profit. Contrary to popular opinion, owners rarely get involved in sports in order to generate cash.

Forgive my cynicism, but I don't really believe how an American sports-investment conglomerate with absolutely no knowledge or contact with football in the past, has decided to purchase one of the most storied football clubs in the world for love of the game. This isn't being run as the play-toy of a Russian oligarch, the marketing exercise of a Saudi prince, the refuge of a supporters trust or in the safeguard of a local and passionate Red businessman, it's being run by a sporting investment company. I don't expect them to indebt the club in the way the Glazers did, nor do I expect them to take money out as a yearly shareholder dividend, but I do wholeheartedly belive they are only here to increase the value of their investment. While I do believe that the interests in increasing value run alongside my desire to win trophies, I think it's particularly craven to pretend otherwise.

The vast majority of the rest of the statement is heavily idealistic rhetoric about how we're investing for the future and how that will help us long term. It takes either extreme naivety or extreme arrogance to think that we can start from scratch, and just be cleverer than our competitors and that alone will pay yield sometime in the future. This is especially true coming from the lack of experience of foreign owners who knew nothing about running a football club or liverpool city at the start of this journey. Do we honestly think that these football clubs, valued in the hundreds of millions and some in the billions of pounds, are not uniformly doing the exact same? Do we honestly think that Man City, Man Utd, Chelsea, Tottenham, Arsenal, and all our former European rivals are not actively investing for the future in youth teams, and training facilities and scouting networks etc? Do we honestly think that these clubs haven't invested in the neccessary staff to streamline their operations and invest for the future to some extent? Maybe not all of them, but certainly most of them do. The premier league table for over a decade has been dictated by the wage bill of the clubs and that statistic should clearly indicate that in the highest reaches of modern football where everyone is good at training and identifying targets and finding decent managers, the most important alterable factor is investment and finances. 

Liverpool needs to make use of its advantages in order to compete, and that means making the most of a well-established uniquely talented spine of the squad, a global brand name rivaled by few in the world, and a reputation for winning and success that draws players our competitors in the 5th-10th range don't have. By having a long drawn-out 16 year plan to invest for youth, we're are turning away from some of our unique advantages and our keeping blind faith that we can simply do the basics better than everyone else (which runs against the historic evidence available).

And in the meantime, this threadbare squad and promise of investing for the future means that when I go to anfield and fork over 43GBP, I'm seeing a team which is no longer expected to win trophies or even to challenge for champions league football. It means that when I apply for the autocup scheme, I'm going to be paying to see the U18s have a training match and see who can make the cut, as opposed to be competing with some of the best clubs in Europe for a trophy? Fuck off.


I am becoming increasingly disgruntled by the lack of meaninful progress being made by Henry and co. For all the rhetoric and allusions to a Shankly-esque era of rebuilding, I am yet to see either a series of positive steps to make us any better than we were 5 years ago, or a cohesive plan that stands up to all the talk.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"A quick response:

1. Kaboul was only injured recently. That was AVB's preferred pairing but is now unavailable. He has challenged Dawson to make his way back into the team, so obviously AVB is aware of this issue and is working to fix it.

2. I have noticed a trend with AVB blooding new players. He tends to hold off on playing his new signings right out of the box and prefers to ease them in. I would expect to see the Dembele - Sandro - Siggy combination become the staple of our starting 11 in the near future. AVB doesn't seem to like dropping new players in cold.

3. I think a lot of this has to do with service and targets. With only Defoe in the front to work with and Livermore providing service it's tough to involve our pacey wingers as much as we would want. Let's not also forget we did just lose one of the best in the business in Modric. I expect this to be rectified with Ade/Dembele starting.

4. Of course. But Ade isn't match fit apparently and we couldn't play Dempsey yesterday. Defore won't be our starter upfront for much longer.

true,Silgrenus,cyberman,Cyberperson,"OK, fair enough. Perhaps you're right, perhaps as an 18-year-old guy I've been too harsh on Amy. I agree with your raising River post, for the most part. But one thing that stuck out more than anything was this: After 2000 years of waiting, Rory is told that it means nothing in comparison to Amy's sterility. 2000 years. Without being asked. Without so much as a thank you. Knowing that he could die, or melt, or be injured and never be able to heal. Living through all of humanity's great wars. And for Amy to turn around and say that it's nothing compared to 'giving him up' is just disgusting. You can spin any way you like, but that is probably the lowest and cruelest thing a person could say to another. 

But since we're talking about River, one thing that infuriated me about the two is this: They don't care that River was taken. Seriously. At the end of 'Let's Kill Hitler', they just zoom away. No mention of losing out on their kid's life for the odd twenty-forty years, no anger or resentment at the Doctor for not doing enough, no guilt, no misery, no depression between themselves, nothing. No horror when they realise that River grew up in a horrible orphanage, or living as a homeless kid on the streets of New York City? That she, as a black girl, lived through the race riots in the UK and probably the US, risking her life? There's nothing. Amy and Rory are the worst parents you could imagine. And then, finally, when Amy kills Kovarian, it's presented in a 'Oh, she's still upset about that?' light. 

I can't feel sorry for Amy. She is the most horrid, self-entitled character of any show I've ever seen. And Rory is an idiot who can't realise what an abusive relationship he's in.

The owners and Rodgers have been saying for months that fans should not be expecting a Top 4 place this year, but fans are still screaming about how players need to be bought for us to challenge for a Top 4 position. Most people now feel that we had a very good window except the last day when another striker wasn't brought in. But an experienced striker might not have fit in, we are seeing now how Suarez is negating Borini's work, and how Gerrard is not fitting the style we're playing. Sturridge would have been a good choice, but I always doubted that Chelsea would be that dumb to loan him to us. I have about 2 articles for this,  1 on Gerrard and 1 on the whole Suarez Borini positions. 

I keep saying that this year is our buffer year. It's the year where Rodgers will not be fired for anything short of a criminal offence. The owners will point to the fact that we brought in young, exciting players and let go of old overpriced ones. The striker thing is probably a mistake, but not a severe one in the greater scheme of things. This is a year where we could afford to take things slowly. With or without Dempsey,  the Being Liverpool show will likely raise our profile greatly not just in America but worldwide. Our big sponsorship deals are all just starting so there's no need for good results to chase a new one. 

Rodgers needs 1 of 2 things for his style to work: 6 months of training, or a new squad. We can't afford a whole new squad,  so it has to be time. Notice that he spoke about decision making in his press conference. Training only tells you what you should do. Often in the match, instinct takes over and makes you do what you want, not what you need.

I'm totally opposed to that. I'm quite happy knowing that I will only ever come into close contact with guns when they are in the hands of the armed forces and armed police. I don't know any farmers so I'm unlikely to see one of their guns, and I'd have to go well out of my way to find a gang that was involved in gun crime.  
Allowing people to have guns in the home for self defence gives criminals easier access to guns. I don't want that. As much as some people say ""Guns don't kill people, people kill people"" I'd still prefer to not make it any easier for them.

Besides, surely if the safety of the British public is in question then we should be arming our *police* long before we should be arming everyone who wants a gun in their home.

Back in the seventies and eighties, I would argue that the perceived age range of the show was lower than it is now, so that, while the BBC liked to pretend it was a show the whole family gathered around regularly, in truth, it was mainly seen as a children's show - and often, a butt of jokes, with wobbly sets/the gravel pit, paper mache aliens, and bored thesps mumbling in embarrassment, or hamming it up like bad panto.

This was ideal for me and my brother, avid space fans from an early age, who had bags of imagination to fill in the gaps where the production values were found lacking.   As kids we held Doctor Who as being up there with the very best SF on telly - Space 1999, Blake's 7, and The Bionic Man.  Tom Baker was the guy we grew up with (I can just about remember Mr. Pertwee) and we'd tune in every Saturday, terrified and spellbound.  Although when I was especially young, I was unable to watch at least a couple of episodes, finding the monsters altogether too scary.  (The Mandrill is ringing bells here...)

Spin on several years, however, and by the time Davison's era was well under way, we were feeling a bit too old for the show, being able to see the incredible cheapness of it all for the first time.  Kid's show *Blue Peter* would often feature 'how to' tutorials on the special effects, using materials like Fairy liquid bottles and 'sticky back plastic', and it was with derision that people often noted you could make more convincing special effects in your own kitchen than you'd find in the show.

As our teenage years hit, we started to drift away from Doctor Who.  Movies like Blade Runner and Alien were more in tune with our maturing tastes, and it felt like the show had, if anything, become a bit of an anachronism by then.  By Colin Baker's run I was barely watching the show, then Bonnie Langford came along, and I think I stopped entirely.

It was slightly sad when it was cancelled, but not exactly a big surprise.  New, trendy Channel 4 had come along, with an emphasis on rebellious youth culture, and the BBC was looking like an uncool dinosaur by comparison.

When it came back, I was quite pleased, but with some trepidation - I expected it would be aimed young, might well be overly camp, and would almost certainly suffer from the same cheapness of old, this being the budget-capped BBC.  Indeed, so it proved - I only managed to watch the first few episodes before stopping.  The farting aliens, well, alienated (sorry) me entirely and I went back to going out on Saturday nights, like a grown-up should.  

By the end of the first series, my nephew had become obsessed with it, so I started watching it with him dutifully, only to find it had dramatically improved, and enjoyed the next few years through his eyes.  I still found the show a bit childlike for my tastes until Series 5, by which point the level of maturity increased to the point of delight and a return to mid-seventies-fervour for me, but confusion for my nephew. who has latterly dumped the show in favour of his ongoing love-affair with Tracy Beaker.  But that's his problem.

Anyway, to answer your third question, the main thing I think they're lacking in the present format (ironically for a time-travelling show) is time.  Time to let the stories breathe properly.  The episodes should be no shorter than last week's 48 minutes, but ideally an hour.",0,1346669215,null,0,false,0,c62r8qa,t3_z9q61,t1_c62r8qa,t3_z9q61,null,1429804929,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

1- Council Tax (if you're student living with other students there's no need to pay it. It you're student living with no students, you'd have to pay it, although there's a 25% discount. If you're a professional living with other professional you'll have to pay it... the price? It depends the zone and the kind of building. I think I have to pay like 1200 pounds year here in Marchmont)

2- Gas, Electricity. I don't know how much is that yet... Some flats only have electricity so they don't pay gas bill. 

3- TV Licence. It's 24 pounds a month and is only if you want to watch TV. 

4- Broadband. It's a crap, 'cause you have to pay like 14 pounds for the line rental plus the internet conection, that can be around 15 or 20 pounds I think, although you can pay like the half for 6 months and offers like that. 

And I don't remember now anything else, so if anybody can complete my information...  Oh, yeah, now a lot of agencies make you pay like 3 months rent in advance if you have no Uk's warrantor due the economic situation... so that's another thing to take into account.

Not evidence.  It's not demonstrable and certainly cannot be attributed to a God without such evidence.  A man claimed he was blind and then claimed he could see miraculously.  I could do that very same thing today; I could go into church and do the exact same thing and no one would know if I was blind or not before I entered.

Maths is one of the subjects that I feel people either love or loathe, but most loathe it because it is 'hard' or it is cool to hate maths.

No, actually, it wasn't. Even the wiki states that this point was/ is disputed.

Emotional distance is possibly a factor, but unlikely to be a significant one. Auto-surveillance is nothing new, CCTV cameras are a direct stationary analogue, for which there have not been any significant problems, and for which we've had some moderate successes. If things go wrong, responsibility would be with the police who manage and operate these systems.

&gt; For the remote operator who is tasked with deploying tazers, baton rounds or chemical weapons, the group of people become dehumanised.

If and when they weaponise police drones like this, you may have a point, but again this is a minor issue and does not represent a new thing, all of the above are issues which can be done by the police already. Not new, just a different way of doing the same thing.

Except baton rounds, we won't have those on drones, the recoil would destroy any that are small enough to get close to the ground.

It seems there is a common problem of not that the drones are bad themselves, but that they make easier other things which people think of as bad.

Possibly a valid worry, but I think the focus should not be the drones in that case, but the potential for the police to use baton rounds, teargas or tasers.

&gt; With one thousand drones the entire UK shoreline could be policed constantly. 

Well yes. One of the good parts about Drones. I fail to see why this is bad. Being able to better police our shores would, surely, be a boon to the nation by making the anti-smuggling efforts more effective and potentially cheaper.

Without the tackles up front you put even more responsibility on Mikel and Lampard and require more running from them which isn't going to work too well with Lampard.

true,Mr_Wolfgang_Beard,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"I agree that this man was lucky to have a gun to defend himself with at the time, however that isn't the thing to take away this headline. The thing to remember is that he was *incredibly unlucky in the first place* to be the victim of aggravated burglary. If aggravated burglary was a regular occurance and it happened three times a day in the UK then I would scream from the rooftops ""Please give me a gun to defend my home with, we are in a crisis!"", but the truth is that there is no need.

Criminals will **always** be empowered compared to law abiding citizens. They are empowered by breaking the rules. If they didn't break the rules then they wouldn't be criminals!

Here's the thing; a well armed society is not a safer society:  
Count all the people that could threaten you with violence/murder right now in the UK.  
Now imagine that every othere person in the UK owns a gun. Count all the people that could threaten you with violence and murder after the change (it has soared up to roughly 100%).
Now imagine how many people could threaten you with violence/murder if everyone had a gun (including you)... I don't think that number is lower than the original number. I think that (on average) for every person that is capable and willing to mug you by threatening you with violence, there is another person who is willing to mug you but unable to because they can't actually pose a threat to you.  
I think that for every person you detter with your gun there is probably someone undettered that has just been enabled by their own gun.

Easy access to guns might make *you* safer, but that doesn't make *everyone* safer. In fact there will be many members of society who will be put in more danger as a result (firstly because there are more threats and secondly because everyone else just got relatively safer, therefore they got relatively less safe). Those people are the blind, the amputees, the paraplegic, the pacifists, the reformed criminals who are honest members of society but can't legally aquire firearms due to their chequered past, the people who are just utterly incompetant with firearms!...

If you want to be personally safer then sure, getting a gun might do that; but you can't always be there to protect everything you have and everyone you love. If you make it each individual's responsibility to protect themselves and anything/one else they wish to protect then somewhere down the line people are going to miss out. Yeah that might work out well for you protecting yourself, but now I have a huge burden because I want to look out for my family and friends - many of whom can't look out for themselves. We don't live in a society dictated by ""every man for himself"", we don't want to live in a country where personal safety is a privilage you have to afford and pay for. We live in a society where everybody's safety is everybody's responsibility, and the safety is guaranteed by paying a tax that pays a smaller group of our society to protect us - the police.

**TL;DR:** If you want to be safer then by a gun. If you want the UK to be safer then keep guns restricted and improve the police force.",0,1346673349,null,0,false,0,c62rlob,t3_z9rup,t1_c62rlob,t1_c62ra7m,null,1429805096,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

However, there are problems with this. Can you take the A-levels you want at the place you want with the GCSEs you have? Then there is university - if you intend to apply to uni you will generally do that in your last year of A-levels. As you don't have them yet, your only academic record are your GCSEs. While English might not matter for what you want to do it will put you at the bottom of a long list of applicants and will work against you.

Then you have entry level jobs - many of those *only* care about GCSEs as a basic proficiency measure. You'd be surprised at how many places will insist on Cs no matter what other grades you have - the job market is competitive and it's an easy way for them to reduce the number of applicants they need to consider.

My advice is to resit asap. It's going to be a major pain to do it while you're working on A-levels and what have you so do it sooner rather than later so it doesn't mess up your final year. Put effort into your coursework and ask friends and teachers for advice on your coursework so you can do a good job. With good coursework you can get away with a lot more come the final exam (though it depends a bit on the exam board as to how much of your final grade is coursework).

The last thing is that sometimes you can get the option of just retaking one part - talk to your teachers and see if it's possible to raise your grade to a C just by retaking one paper or redoing one piece of coursework.

Using a bow (or a javelin, knife, sword, your fists, a rock, or pretty much any martial art you can think of) with skill requires a combination of dexterity and strength. Firearms require purely dexterity. It is a *HUGE* game changer. An obese eight year old could learn to operate a firearm and be deadly with it in a week. They wouldn't be deadly with a bow in that time.

I could hold you at gunpoint for hours and hours with ease. I'd need arms of steel to keep you at bowpoint for half an hour. I could fire shot after shot after shot with a gun untill i run out of ammunition, but I'd be exhausted trying to sustain an arrow volley without loads of training.

I find that relates to the Davies era, not Moffat's. Davies' run focused much more on adventures with a lesson behind them (like the old series), character development and interactions, cause and consequence... 

I think Moffat has succeeded in making his version, well, *his*. I find the 11th Doctor run so far to have a lot more action/excitement and a faster pace than Davie's. I don't think he ruining the series at all, I find it to be a really interesting take. 

I started watching Doctor Who when I was 6-7 years old and every time the Doctor regenerated, the style of the series changed a bit too. It's been 20 years and I still find it to be the best series because it *doesn't* remain the same and become stagnant, it evolves.

Unoccupied houses that aren't being used or put on the market, bankrupt office spaces, etc. There are thousands of buildings meeting this criteria across the UK.

I am absolutely not saying that you can take anything became you want it, that would be absurd.

But if you're starving and steal a loaf of bread, I have no problem with that. If you're homeless and may die of exposure this winter then I have no problem with you squatting in a vacant house. 

Frankly, the fact that there are homeless people in 21st century Britain, at the same time as there are hundreds of thousands of second homes and disused buildings is appalling, and something that needs to to be addressed.

&gt;Indeed, but my analogy was to illustrate that 'wealthy' means different things to different people - you're really trying to justify 'you have this, I don't, therefore I have a right to take it'.

As I've said, we're talking about the necessities of life. That is why your analogy was a strawman, because I am not talking about any other context.

&gt;A closer analogy would be 'I have several ways to obtain food, but taking yours is easier. What do you mean, that's not on?'

No, it would not be closer. I have been working with the homeless for long enough to know that this is absolutely not the case. There aren't enough council homes available by a long, long stretch of the imagination. The homeless are pretty much locked out of the private housing market entirely. In places without night shelter facilities like where I live, what else would you suggest? What several other ways of getting housed do you know of?

&gt;No, I was illustrating how flexible your definition of 'wealth' is and how

That's because wealth is always a relative term. That's not me, that's just the proper application of the term.  

&gt;being worse off does not give you have the right to pick and choose what you'd like to take from someone else. You may think it's unfair if they don't give you some of their roast, but that just highlights how the choice is theirs, not yours.

But you do have a right to the basic necessities of life, enshrined in both UK and EU law. If that's not being provided for at the moment, and there are literally thousands of vacant properties around the country, I don't see redistributing what is needed as unjust, but rather as vital.",0,1346676049,null,0,false,0,c62rvh5,t3_z4i9g,t1_c62rvh5,t1_c62qrxh,null,1429805226,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Yeah, no. In the same way as if an untrained kid threw a knife in someone's direction, or fired the aforementioned short bow, there's a chance that they would hit and kill you with a firearm. But it is not a point/click interface that requires no training or practice. You can certainly get very lucky, but it is not a case of guns making it almost impossible _not_ to murder someone. 

Firearms require dexterity and strength, familiarity with the platform, muscle memory, knowledge of techniques and practices in the operation, handling, stance, grip, maintenance, all manner of variables.

&gt;I could hold you at gunpoint for hours and hours with ease. I'd need arms of steel to keep you at bowpoint for half an hour.

Guns are not weightless. There's a reason anyone who is going to actually have to carry one for any duration attaches slings to them.

You've admitted your ignorance on the matter in other comments and yet you're now typing out a ream of text exhibiting that lack of understanding and telling me ""I can't win""? 

Are you seriously contesting that child soldiers in Africa use guns over bows because they're point/click infallible murder machines? No other factors taken into account like the kids not actually being used as legitimate soldiers, but taken so early to ensure that their indoctrination holds and they're hooked on drugs nice and reliably? Or, say, the fact that they aren't even used as effective combat troops as much as first-wave cannon fodder so the cowards who took them don't draw any return fire? Nothing about Kalashnikov-pattern rifles being _more common and cheaper_ than shit like bows &amp; quivers in those areas? Nope, simple as that. Child soldiers are given rifles (never mind that they can't shoot it without toppling over half the time, or need to be within five feet to hit anything) and that's the end of it. All the thinking I need, ta!

Then you should be advocating the ability for civilians to own firearms and use them in self-defence against a violent intruder without fear of legal reprisal. Those same civilians will be just as competent if not more so than the ARU, in addition to already being on the scene. As the old expression goes - ""when seconds count, the police are just minutes away"".

You're operating on alarmism, saying that if civilians owned guns that would make it easier for criminals to get hold of them, therefore ban all guns. That is tabloid thinking. Civilians already own guns in the UK. Fucking lots of them. They're not getting raided daily, or even frequently - the reason this article is so remarkable is because incidences involving firearms are so rare in the UK that whenever one crops up people get shocked all over again that these things are still in our country, and somehow we're not all dying in horrific bloodbaths daily. _How could that be?_ Yet the fact remains that plenty of people own them, and if this guy had not had access to one of his shotguns to repel the intruders, there would now be four criminals with an illegally-acquired set of firearms, or at least one (it's not often that people own just one: if he had one shotgun to hand there is a fair chance he had more locked in a wall-mounted safe). But they don't, because he was able to defend his home against the armed intruders. Instead of, say, being held at knifepoint while they fucked his wife, forced him to open the safe under duress, or just took his gun and left, leaving him to call the police and wait for them to muddle out an ARU to turn up 20 minutes late and take a case report, or just shoot him and his family in a blind, incompetent panic.",0,1346676359,null,0,1346676809,0,c62rwq9,t3_z9rup,t1_c62rwq9,t1_c62rmk3,null,1429805242,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

It could become a systemic concern, similar to the corporation where there are possible fines or a public scolding for the institution rather than criminal proceedings towards a particular officer.

Whoever fails the hardest at ""pin the blame on the other guy"", usually. Depending on the problem specifics, pilot error, maintenance error, programming error etc. ""If something goes wrong"" is too vague a problem to pin down to a single person.

&gt; The contention was ""no new powers"" I thought.

They can already monitor the borders, it's just harder and less effective as it is now.

(Fun fact, that originally said ""minority the borders"", good thing I noticed it... Freudian slip perhaps? We'll never know!)

&gt; Up until recently image processing was largely impossible to impractical due to computers being unable to discern a face from a plate of spaghetti. Understand when a face is upside down is no easy task. It really is foolish to brush this off as insignificant, and apply the false equivalency of old tech (CCTV), same as the new tech (flying CCTV with the ability to operate independently and make decisions). The latter is a significant step in power.

It is, but all improvements in technology are a step up in power, that does not make them automatically new powers, as they can just be more powerful implementations of old police powers.

&gt; Consider one social consequence, it allows surveillance to be mass produced and controlled by an increasing minority of people. With sufficient advances I can imagine a scenario where maybe a team of 10 people are charged with the near total surveillance of a major conurbation because drones and the stationary CCTV cameras can police them selves. I liken it to the transition from pen to printing press, or hand weaving to factory loom. The new power is one of scale and possible centralisation.

There are few who would argue that those transitions were bad, though. Sure, we may end up with major cities running fleets of drones from small teams (I would expect it to come sooner than later, in fact), but this does not represent a threat to us. If there is a threat then we should focus on that rather than the secondary issue of drone use.

Practically speaking, they'll be used to follow shoplifters through cities until someone can catch up with them. They'll be used to track stolen cars or cars that are breaking the laws. They'll be used to identify ""shifty"" people walking around schools for some attention from the police.

I am not seeing the danger, here. In order to see any potential problems I am forced to assume nefarious motives and corruption at all levels of government and the police. I do not grant this assumption.

I'm simply frustated that we didn't move for a goalscorer earlier in the window, or at all. It was obvious through last season that we need a finisher to play the ball into, who we can rely on to put it in the net. Suarez doesn't do that, he's creative and should be the one feeding, not being fed. Carroll doesn't fit in with the players we have and the style we want to play. While there may have been other motives to moving him on, other than tactics, he isn't the finisher we're looking for. While he may have shown touches of class with goals, I still think he'd be played in a partnership, with a more prolific goalscorer. I hope I'm not coming across as a dick and being too dismissive, I just feel that I'm being slightly misunderstood. My frustration lies not specifically with Dempsey, but the lack of a finisher at all. Even if it was another Assaidi-type signing in terms of how known they are, I wouldn't have had a problem with it, as it would've been another option to swap and change and possibly add goals in a match, where Suarez is tiring and/or Borini isn't finishing either.

Seriously, though, this really won't (can't) make a difference. The difference between normal weight and obese is usually a small daily excess of calories sustained over a long period, and appetite varies with energy burnt. The issues are mostly with very low activity levels, and with unbalanced diets, or with more complex underlying issues. Even if someones excess weight really is fuelled by bingeing on sweets, taking the sweets away won't help - the need to binge is caused by something, the will-power solution actually causes problems such as burning muscle for energy rather than fat (due to the autonomic stress response) and thus reducing the metabolic rate, and ultimately that person will just binge on something else unless the underlying issue gets fixed.

We are playing our final game of the season at home against Everton in a tight 1-1 draw. 

There's 7 minutes left in the game, and an exhausted Jordan Henderson is being called to the bench for a final substation. Brendan Rodgers and his assistant manager Jamie Carragher, are talking to the man they call Steven Gerrard, who is carefully tucking in his shirt and getting ready to step onto the pitch. The league leaders are currently down 0-1 when they should be level, had Fernando Torres not hit the post with the goal gaping.

Henderson comes off the pitch and is given a firm handshake from the manager after releasing Fabio Borini into the opposition half, allowing him to set up Luis Suarez who calmly curls a beautiful shot low into the bottom corner to bring equalize after an early blunder by LFC goalkeeper Pepe Reina.

Gerrard steps onto the pitch and is greeted by his captain and #21 Lucas, who hands him the captain's armband. The crowd is erupting at the news that the league leaders are now down 2-0 Swansea City with no hope of making a comeback with the few minutes that remain.

Gerrard can still feel the pain in his leg from a series of injuries sustained during the 2010/2012 seasons, but brushes it aside after a quick exchange of words with vice-captain Martin Kelly.

Minutes pass and the crowd is on the edge of their seats. After several quick passes in the midfield, the ball comes to Martin Kelly, who begins darting up the right wing. He sees Raheem Sterling, a player who's future with Liverpool is in question after much interest from Real Madrid, open on the left flank.

Kelly hoofs it cross field and Sterling takes the ball and sprints forward without a break in stride. He cuts onto his right foot and sees an opportunity to put in one of his signature top corner shots into the net. He hooks the ball - it's going in. At least it was, until Fellaini leaps into the air and deflects it away from goal with his bushy head.

As the players watch the ball fly back out of the box, the clock reads 0:33 left in extra time. Time stands still as reality sets in - that was the last good chance they can get to take the lead.

At that moment, the ball falls to the feet of Steven Gerrard, who without any hesitation, guides the ball in front of him. He watches it suspend in the air, almost frozen. Without so much as blinking, Gerrard pulls his right leg back and strikes the ball as hard as he can - he can feel the pain in his leg as he hits the ball, flying towards the net, with a look of fear on Tim Howard's face as You'll Never Walk Alone echoes through Anfield.",0,1346680679,null,0,false,0,c62sgyv,t3_za1sw,t1_c62sgyv,t3_za1sw,null,1429805583,14,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,14

I'm sorry, no. The owners have been here two years. Don't blame FSG for what the previous owners did. Yes, Henry came in, allowed Dalglish and Comolli to splash the cash in the hope we'd achieve success relatively quickly, and then ultimately failed, but he seems to have realised his mistake. He's stopped, stood back and admitted that what happened last season was not good, and has vowed for it not to happen again. 

As a Liverpool fan, you need to have more faith. What's the point in, after FSG announce their long-term intentions, slamming them over and over for last season's mistakes? Football moves on, and that's what we're doing. Mistakes have been recognised, but plans are in place to ensure they don't happen again, and I believe 110% that BR and FSG will get us back up with the best in the world in the coming years.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;Please stop using the ridiculous strawman that I'm somehow arguing that it's generally ok to take something just because you don't have it. I am not. 

Err...righto, please stop using the ridiculous assumption than my comments are directed purely at you and are in no way related to the squatters' attitudes and justifications that are primarily what the law change is intended to stop, as well as being considered a justified attitude by a lot of peeps in this thread. Once you start deciding your own criteria on someone else's property or wealth, the line does get very thin very fast.

&gt;If you're homeless and may die of exposure this winter then I have no problem with you squatting in a vacant house

There's the rub - you have no problem with someone squatting in *a* vacant house; things change for most people when they find people squatting in *their* house. And remember, it's not very hard to find hostels or the like - this is more a matter of vacant houses being *better* rather than being the only option.

&gt;there are hundreds of thousands of second homes and disused buildings is appalling, and something that needs to to be addressed.

Indeed, and there are several ways this might be addressed via incentives - but these will rely on a) $ from the councils and b) the owners actually *wanting* people in their houses, which is where it gets difficult. If you're going to start dictating how people use their property, that's a very big can of worms to open. My car is twelve years old, and yet there are hundreds, if not *thousands* of empty, brand new cars sitting in our streets right now. Can I have one? After all, their owners blatantly aren't using them, etc. etc. - can you see how this argument spirals?

&gt;As I've said, we're talking about the necessities of life. That is why your analogy was a strawman, because I am not talking about any other context.

Err...OK, welcome to the concept of threads with more than one person in them. It's not very hard to see what someone's addressing without resorting to shrieking 'Strawman!' when it doesn't specifically apply to *you*. You're now talking about the necessities of life, but began with the idea of wealth being subjective prompting my analogy about a packet of crisps, yes? Stating two comments later that you're only talking about one context smacks of butthurt and not much else.

&gt;No, it would not be closer. I have been working with the homeless for long enough to know that this is absolutely not the case.

And I've been giving apples to the homeless long enough that most of them don't want food, just money. I used to know where (and a long time ago, used several of) the soup kitchens and shelters in or near the West End are. Some (like the Sally Army one at Whitechapel) are pretty grim, but they're still better than nowt.

&gt;In places without night shelter facilities like where I live, what else would you suggest?

You're illustrating the difference between 'should' and 'is'. There 'should' be jobs for people wherever they live, so that they don't have to move (or commute) across the country for work - of course, it isn't like that, but you can't *force* local employers to simply create more jobs. And in this case, you're asking why homeless people can't live where they choose? That responsibility doesn't transfer onto the owner of the nearest empty house - ultimately, you start with your local council - each council has a *duty* to house (or find shelter for) their constituents, but a lot of the shelters will only take you if you're referred by them.

&gt;That's because wealth is always a relative term. That's not me, that's just the proper application of the term. 

Which, when left to the individual, means you lose that packet of crisps. That's part of why we can't simply use the properties of 'the wealthy' - it's a vague term employed by those who see themselves as the have-nots to justify pretty much anything they want.

&gt;But you do have a right to the basic necessities of life, enshrined in both UK and EU law.

That's right - And it's up to your local council to fulfil this obligation - it doesn't legitimise squatting/ taking someone else's property/ deciding for yourself how this assistance will be provided.",0,1346681205,null,0,false,0,c62sjuc,t3_z4i9g,t1_c62sjuc,t1_c62rvh5,null,1429805622,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Prairie_Dog,cyberman,Cyberperson,"OK, I'll try to answer those from my perspective:

1) I really wasn't directly aware of the cancellation of Classic Who. I watched re-runs of it on PBS in the US on Saturday night as a kid. Therefore, I wasn't watching it real-time anyway. Many shows we watched back in the 70's &amp;amp; 80's were syndicated reruns, we were still watching the original Star Trek for instance, which had been cancelled for many years. I then went off to college in the late 80's and my Saturday nights were occupied by things other than late night viewing of old SiFi :-)

2) I had heard about the reboot when it first was planned, but since I didn't have access to the BBC or BBC America, it didn't really mean much to me. I actually first got into watching the rebooted show in 2010 because I found I could buy it via iTunes. I actually watched Torchwood first. I had been reading about it on the Internet and it was as awesome as people made it out to be.

3) What I would like to see done differently in the new series, there are a few things:

I'd like to see it reigned in in terms of scope. Could the Doctor save a planet or society instead of the whole universe? And could we please quit using unbelievably big and illogical means to do so, like Rose becoming a demi-god by absorbing the heart of the TARDIS, or rebooting the whole universe by flying the Pandorica into the TARDIS explosion?

Secondly, could we get a interesting companion who isn't a young female from contemporary earth? Maybe we could have multiple companions like we did in the past? An actual alien might be nice.

Lastly, could we go back to self-contained stories that aren't necessarily just a part of a season long story arc? Classic who didn't neccesarily have to be watched in exact order to be understood. I don't mind a larger story being told, but let's have episodes that are also complete stories in themselves.

People are often not rational, especially when it comes to such emotional things like that. Being barren isn't just about the end result (a child), it's also about a woman's identity as a woman.

That never came up though, she explicitly stated it was because Rory wanted kids and she couldn't give him any (bar River but they seem to have forgotten about her)

&gt;Finding out you're unable to have children is usually quite devastating. It's the one big experience that a woman can have that a man can't.

Sorry what? Are you implying men can't be infertile? What school did you go to that taught you that?

true,daveduckman,null,null,"I'd like to make 2 points in response.

1. I'm not holding the failures of last year against FSG, I am perfectly happy to say that Kenny was given an opportunity, was fully backed and we had a poor season. The owners have then picked their man they want to take the club forward and I'm happy with that. But looking purely at what has happened this season (or pre-season more accurately) makes me question how much they are truly willing to invest in the club and how ingenious that strategy really is. The club seems to have been strippied to the bone, presumably with the rationale of rebuilding it from the ground up, but while we've torn away a lot of the backroom and squad deadwood, there hasn't been nearly as much reinforcement. Sure we got a lot players of the wage bill, but what happened to all that money? Were we severely overbudget? Is this all about placating the FFP rules that are yet to have been enacted, and really don't matter that much when you're not in the champions league to begin with? Plus after all the rumoured discussion of a leadership triumvirate with something resembling a sporting director, there seems to have been Ian Ayres alone running our transfer strategy - a man with no experience at it, and who only seems to be marginally better at negotiating than Purslow or Commoli. 
But all that alone would have caused me uneasiness but still optimism, the real kicker is the amateurism with which we acted in the last days of the trasnfer window. Having put off signing any players on the silly logic of ""we have to sell to buy"" (which immediately drops the value of anyone you're trying to offload when everyone knows you're desperate), we emphasised picking up players on a deadline day frenzy and failed abysmally. Clint Dempsey was as gift-wrapped a prospect as one could believe, was turning down offers left right and centre to play at liverpool and was being priced at the not extorionate value of 6mil. And yet we refused to increase our offer by 1-2mil. We refused when we had absolutely no plan b and had already offloaded our squad such that we HAD to get a replacement. We screwed up plain and simple, and JWH's statement seems to indicate that this decision making stems not from Ayre's or Rodgers, but from him and FSG. That's my bone to pick with their strategy.

2. With regards to the I need to have more faith etc. A point I'd like to make not directed at you neccessarily but towards the large swathes of North American fans who seem to dominate reddit. I've lived in Liverpool for years, every year I fork out over 1000gbp in tickets alone to the club directly for tickets, let alone all the rest of the footballing costs. I'm one of the people sitting in the kop end singing songs at full pelt week in week out, and I'm the one who is now putting up with the prospect of a european football season filled with teenagers as a form of trial and the sobering realisation that the ambition of this club for this season seems not even be to seriously challenge for a top four spot. It's from this passionate standpoint, having moved to liverpool as a fan of the club and not just pirating streams and buying bootleg merchandise, that I demand more accountablility and more actions from owners who insist on making this their *vision*. I'll have faith with the squad, I'll have faith with the manager, I'll have faith the the city, but I will not blindly assume that profiteering American owners are in it for the same reasons that I am, nor will I blindly assume that just because we say we have a long term plan, is that sufficient for us to be better than our rivals.",0,1346682204,null,0,false,0,c62spon,t3_z9tpc,t1_c62spon,t1_c62sihl,null,1429805699,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

By the time they'd come out on DVD I'd heard all the great reviews (from friends as well as magazines etc.) so wasn't at all worried that they'd ruined it.

3. I think the main difference between Classic and Modern Who is the budget. The Beeb has a fine tradition of making sets and props from toothpaste tubes and tinfoil and this was very evident in the classic show. What unites the two is their ability to terrify children (and adults) without any violence or gore.

Second time round, River refused to do her bit, and so broke time, and it was only *after* this had happened, that the Doctor was able to let her know about the Tesselecta, and set up the third time round, where all the pre-requisits of the fixed point in time where in place, but only technically this time.

true,Quazz,capaldi,Capaldi,"&gt;I'm still wondering who blew up the TARDIS in season 5

The Silence. They managed to project a flesh signal into the TARDIS with ease, making the TARDIS explode shouldn't be much harder.

Alternative theory is River Song. She was still brainwashed by the Silence after all. She might have sabotaged it herself, which she later regrets ""I'm sorry my love""

&gt;and whose voice was saying ""Silence will fall"" inside the TARDIS.

Unknown as of yet, although it's likely building up to that. Guessing that's the big baddy boss. I'm still thinking it's very likely a Timelord, given the knowledge of the TARDIS they posses. 

&gt;Oh, and why was a whole army of intergalactic peoples pissed at the Doctor in Season 6?

Most were actually just mercenaries hired to fight for the Silence.

&gt;Or, now, why, in the history of the Daleks, they've never called him ""the Predator"" but....now they do? 

Different points in time. Besides, it might just be Dalek slang if you will. I mean, when you're about to attack your greatest enemy, calling him the Predator of the Daleks doesn't exactly inspire feelings that aren't fear.

&gt;And maybe I just missed something, but....where the hell are all these Daleks coming from?! One Dalek escapes from the Doctor, and now there's so many they can fill a whole planet just with reject Daleks?

Actually, several of them escaped. And this was the Dalek parliament. It's likely these aren't exactly warriors, but rather 'politicians', so they never technically fought the Doctor face to face.

 The reject Daleks had been in the Asylum possibly for millions of years, if not longer. (which showed, they were all damaged)

&gt;You would think, after being willing to timelock his entire planet and people just to stop them, he would do whatever it takes to get rid of that one Dalek and not, say, let them completely rebuild their civilization....which they seem to have done here.

Actually, I would think the opposite. What the Doctor did at the Timewar was something he can never forgive himself. And as highlighted in Vampires of Venice, the Doctor carries tons of dead races on his conscience, how many more can he carry?

He has shown mercy to them before (4th Doctor). Tried to kill Davros (5th Doctor). Tried to destroy Skarro (7th Doctor). So he's kind of all over the place in what exactly he wants to do with the Daleks...

Every time again he changes his mind. But he fears himself now. 

I think he's mostly scared of becoming the villain, especially after the whole Raknoss and Timelord Victorious thingies...

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;how do you stop the criminal and unbalanced from having them

By doing what every nation in the world - UK, USA, France, Germany, The Netherlands, The Czech Republic, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Italy, so on... - already does. Background checks on potential buyers to ascertain a level of mental health and lack of violent criminal convictions. You don't just wang them over the counter to whoever walks in. This makes it easier for the hobbyist, hunter, or professional to own them and the criminal is in no way facilitated because they are going to acquire their firearms through nefarious means anyway.

The point is that you _can't_ stop the criminals from having them. You can't, because _they're criminals_. So why affect the law-abiding along with it? Gun crime is a societal issue, not a gun issue. You see reports of gun crime in the USA with such regularity because of societal issues, as well as a media bias (far more often are civilian carriers able to prevent violent crimes or stop deaths, but they go un[der]reported because they don't have the same headline-grabbing impact). But how often do you hear of violent gun crime from the Czech Republic? Their gun laws are almost exactly as liberal as the USA's, allowing open and concealed carry of all manner of weapons. Part of it is the fact that we're more tuned into american news as they're a superpower with language commonality and a huge media import/export with us. And part of it is societal - with the potential to be as freely armed as they are, why would a criminal take the increased risk of attacking people capable of defending themselves? You'll notice a pattern in all the mass shootings in the USA that people cling to as evidence of how guns are bad - they always occur where someone knows he is going to be shooting at unarmed victims rather than in a state or area where people are able to defend themselves.

&gt;Why exactly would civilians be more competent than trained police officers?

You overestimate the competency of armed police officers. Like I said before: civilians are statistically less likely to cause collateral damage than police, whilst dealing with the threat more efficiently. Many police are not well trained at all. They are trained to a certain standard, and often that standard is very low due to budgetary constraints or a simple lack of interest on the behalf of the officer who only has to qualify by hitting a target 7 feet away every 6-10 months, and otherwise never touches a gun.",0,1346683681,null,0,1346689394,0,c62sz5l,t3_z9rup,t1_c62sz5l,t1_c62stxz,null,1429805822,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Tesselecta

&gt;In the first episode, the real future Doctor sent the red envelopes to the companions (including to his own, younger self), and he really did die that time round.

That was the Tesselecta actually... And the envelopes were blue.

&gt;Besides, I don't agree with your 'pre-established events' statement at all, as the way the series was written doesn't match this.

Are you kidding me? It's the only thing that makes the whole Big Bang finally make some sense.

&gt;Second time round, River refused to do her bit, and so broke time, and it was only after this had happened, that the Doctor was able to let her know about the Tesselecta, and set up the third time round, where all the pre-requisits of the fixed point in time where in place, but only technically this time.

It's quite possible those events did take place there and then, except with future Amy and Rory therefore making past Amy and Rory unaware (and thus also the viewer)

In the Shadow of Fiction: How Television Is Making (Up) Muslim History

In Channel 4's Islam: the Untold Story, aired 28 August, British writer Tom Holland - garbed Indiana Jones-style in billowing shirt and trusty hat - treks across the Arabian desert, talking to local Bedouins, and inspecting historical artefacts to investigate the origins of Islam. Muhammed, he concludes, probably never came from Mecca, but from Transjordania; the Qur'an and its teachings are largely borrowed from local religious traditions, Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism; and it is questionable whether 'Islam' ever really existed as a distinctive, coherent faith during Muhammed's reign. Rather, the religion of Islam was an innovation of the Arab empires, cynically manufactured to legitamise its expansion by conquest over much of what we now know as the Middle East.

To vindicate this thesis - based largely on his new book, In the Shadow of the Sword - Holland interviews a handful of sceptical Western scholars of Islam. But his narrative is replete with elementary, often laughable, errors. Perhaps the most glaring is his insistence that Mecca is only mentioned once, ambiguously, in the Qur'an - evidence for Holland that the Prophet never came from Mecca. But this is a strange inaccuracy, for the Qur'an mentions Mecca clearly: ""And He it is Who held back their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca after He had given you victory over them."" (48:24) He then makes much of the Qur'an's references to ""Becca"", as if this must be a completely different place, oblivious to the fact that in South Arabic, the language used in the south of the Arabian peninsula during the time of Muhammed, the sounds b and m were interchangeable - as documented in 1973 by Princeton University Arabist, professor Philip Hitti.

Holland also argues that the Qur'an's frequent references to vines and olives points to the existence of an agricultural society. Mecca was barren and lacked agriculture; therefore, hey presto!, Muhammed's message originated elsewhere. The inference is truly bizarre: neighbouring Medina, where Muhammed emigrated fleeing persecution in Mecca - and where he continued to receive a large bulk of the revelations of the Qur'an - was a thriving ""agricultural settlement, with widely scattered palm groves and armed farmsteads.""

Holland's other pillar of evidence is equally meaningless. Holland visits the site of Sodom, and highlights the Qur'an's statement that its readers ""pass by them in the morning and at night"" (47:133-8) Flabbergasted, Holland asks: ""What is it doing here - a thousand kilometres from Mecca?"" That the Meccans were frequent travelling traders who would have routinely passed through this area - as widely documented by scholars such as William Montgomery Watt in the Encyclopedia of Islam (2008) and Ira Lapidus in his Cambridge University study (1988) - appears to be lost on Holland.

Holland's lack of familiarity with the wider literature in Western scholarship on Islam is thus painfully obvious to serious historians. Early on, Holland speaks of the study of history in Western universities as based on ""scepticism and doubt"" - in contrast, presumably, to Muslim historians, who simply shape 'facts' to fit their faith. The problem is that even though Holland looks dapper in his Indiana outfit, he is not really a historian - and in his latest work, it shows.

Although for the last nine years Holland has written popular history, the bulk of his writing is fiction - including titles such as The Vampyre (1995), Supping with Panthers (1996), The Sleeper in the Sands (1998), and The Bone Hunter (2001). Yet he has no qualifications in history, and cannot even speak Arabic - which is why he employed a Syriac and Arabic-speaking researcher.

It is perhaps not surprising, then, to find him - in true Indy-style - adopting a 1930s colonial mindset early on, informing viewers that: ""To the ancients, the Arabs were regarded as notorious savages."" As if to hit this point home, the only people he finds to endorse orthodox accounts of Islam's origins are Bedouin Arabs living in the desert. At one symbolic point, Holland prays amongst them, then suddenly - for no apparent reason - extracts himself from the congregation in the middle of the prayer only to peer, wonderingly, around him, as if to underscore the questionable origins of one of Islam's most sacred rituals.

Strangely, the only other Muslim who makes an appearance to represent the 'canonical' view of Islam's origins is Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Professor of Islamic Studies at George Washington University. Troubled by what he conceives as gaps in the historical record, and inconsistencies between the scriptural account and hard evidence on the ground, Holland is confidently informed by Nasr that such an absence of evidence is irrelevant for Muslims who recognise the limits of reason in the face of transcendental realities.

But Channel 4's sole selection of Nasr as representative of the orthodox historical account is disingenuous. Although he is a renowned philosopher specialising in comparative religion, Islamic esoterism, philosophy of science, and metaphysics, Nasr has contributed little on the minutiae of Islamic history. Through such selective production values and imagery, the film strikes a stark contrast between Western logic and Muslim belief. Muslims are portrayed as steeped in a strange, backward irrationality - out of touch with the modern world with its newfangled, super-scientific methods of historical analysis, and immune to the impact of reason when it comes to longstanding beliefs.

What Channel 4 viewers aren't told is that the theories Holland regurgitates are not only heavily contested in the wider Western scholarly community, they were almost completely discarded some decades ago. One of their core proponents, Patricia Crone, makes a regular talking-head appearance in the film (as well as being heavily referenced in Holland's book among others). Holland essentially resurrects their ideas - published back in the 1970s - with unnerving gullibility, accentuating the ""black hole"" of evidence on early Islam where one should expect abundance.

But, unbeknownst to Channel 4 researchers, he is simply wrong. Petra Sijpestein, Professor of Arabic at Leiden University, remarks: ""In the writings of 12 years after the death of Muhammad, Muslims are referred to as a separate religious group, first using the term muhajiroun, migrants who had left hearth and home with a purpose, or Saracens, descendents of Sarah and Abraham. And from around 730AD, terms like Islam, Muslims and specific religious customs such as zakat (charity) were already being practiced and described.""

Yet Holland is a man on a mission. Uncritically parroting the Crone thesis that ""there is no hard evidence for the existence of the Koran in any form before the last decade of the seventh century"" - he infers that the Arab empires self-servingly concocted Islam as a radically distinct faith. For one thing, there are numerous Qur'anic manuscripts from the first century of hijra, which possess no significant textual deviations. But worse, apart from the fact that Islam has never presented itself as an entirely new religion (rather as a continuation and confirmation of the Jewish and Christian traditions), this theory has almost no currency at all in the very Western universities that Holland claims to admire.

As noted by the late Robert Seargeant, Sir Thomas Adams Professor of Arabic at Cambridge University, Crone's argument ""is not only bitterly anti-Islamic in tone, but anti-Arabian. Its superficial fancies are so ridiculous that at first one wonders if it is just a 'leg pull', pure 'spoof'."" No wonder that the theory of a ""reconstructable past"" which ""relies only on sources outside of Islam"", has ""been almost universally rejected"" according to Gordon Newsby, Professor of Middle Eastern Studies at Emory University. This is because, says David Waines, an Islamic Studies professor at Lancaster University, it is ""far too tentative and conjectural (and possibly contradictory).""

Serious debate on Islamic historiography is welcome - including re-evaluation of hadith (oral traditions of the Prophet), and re-assessing regressive elements of 'Shari'ah Law' belonging to the cultural conventions of Arab dynasties. Channel 4's film distracts from this urgent task by popularising outmoded anti-Arab theories, long ago dismissed by most serious Western academic institutions as Eurocentric Orientalist fictions.

true,Mozza215,lfcflame,,"1. I think what you're getting at is FSG's reluctance to push out more funds when we seem to need such money to bring in higher quality staff/players. I'd agree that this is the case, but I'm not necessarily against it. We blew a huge transfer kitty last year (over £100m), and it's suddenly made us the transfer window whipping boys. FSG don't want this, and neither do any of the fans, so to take the hit with Carroll (who I agree should not have been allowed to leave until we had a replacement) was the right thing to do. Also, not buying Dempsey was a good decision in my eyes. Yes, we need a striker, there's no denying that, but to once again seem desperate and pay 1-2mil more? I'd prefer us to hold out till January. Fulham's asking price for Dempsey was only so because we messed them around, and our transfer reputation is/was in tatters. I'm quite content that we didn't buy him and I believe we can hold out until January with the strikers we have. Although yes, we did mess up, and everyone has admitted that. And that's where I disagree with your opinion; you're talking as if this mistake hasn't been recognised. It has.

We have a much tougher group than last year, and imo our squad depth is not fantastic.

This is assuming that the whole 'dalek-conversion' thing erased the 'doctor' portion from her head (like some of the other details that were erased from the other partial conversions).

After her run, how they will replace her is having the two of them on board a ship of some sort that has some kind of catastrophe and the doctor escapes without her ... as the ship crashes into the dalek planet.

Its the kind of self-fulfilling paradox moffet loves and it would be heartbreaking to see it happen (think 'Fires of Pompeii' style 'i caused that', but with the death of a companion).

true,daveduckman,null,null,"&gt; We blew a huge transfer kitty last year (over £100m)

That's not really true, because you need to account for the massive profits we made as well from player sales. If we just look at the three previous FSG transfer windows we purchased Carroll (35mil) Suarez (23mil) Henderson (16) Adam (7) Downing (20) Enrique (6) Coates (7) for total spending of about 108mil. However, in the same period we offloaded Torres (50) Babbel (6) Meireless (12) Ngog (4) Poulsen (1) Konchesky (1) Mavinga (1) and a couple of others for total earnings of about 77mil. So our net transfer spend by FSG before this window was only about 30million GBP.

&gt; Also, not buying Dempsey was a good decision in my eyes. Yes, we need a striker, there's no denying that, but to once again seem desperate and pay 1-2mil more? I'd prefer us to hold out till January

I think this is a case of cutting your nose to spite your face. In order to save 1-2mil and potentially teach fulham a lesson (although the way it seems to be is that fulham were only asking us to match the tottenham offer which doesn't really seem unreasonable) we have severly hamstrung ourselves. I'd have no problem if we opted to keep carroll because the asking price for dempsey was too high, but the fact we offloaded our only striking backup with the clear intention to sign dempsey (with no clear backup plan if we couldn't get dempsey) is pure foolishness. In the end West Ham got Carroll, Fulham got the price they wanted for Dempsey, and we're the team that has been made a mockery of.

&gt; I believe we can hold out until January with the strikers we have

Obviously this is just a matter of opinion, but the early signs don't look good. Against arsenal we started with both players who could be conidered strikers (borini and suarez) and the only depth we had on the bench in terms of attacking players was downing (who is inadequate enough that rodgers would have him deputise as a left back instead) and possibly henderson (who I personally love, but who rodgers has such little faith in that he was made a makeweight for a permanent move to fulham in exchange for dempsey). At about 60min, we looked impotent but had no one to bring on to strike fear into the opposition. If the opposition aren't fearful that you'll be able to score in the late stages of the game, then we become very predictable. And it's not like we have huge players coming back into the squad - we have a pair of promising 18 year olds who clearly are not going to be first team fixtures, assidi and cole (who will probably become very familiar with the physios this season). I just don't see how we're even pretending to compete for a top 4 spot with this lack of squad depth. Although I will happily eat my words come january if borini-suarez is the most fearsome premier league strikeforce.

&gt; This season's ambitions are low, but it's one season.

We've been having far too many one-off bad seasons for too long now. We had the finally rafa year when he unravelled, which was a write off to the hodgson era of pragmatic successful football. but that became a write off and we had kenny in to restore faith. but then an unlucky season became another write off as we cleared the slate again and have begun the rodgers era. But what exactly are we calling a success anymore? If we finish 6-8th again, with a similar point tally to last year and a host of promising showings and some disappointing ones, maybe a good cup run - we would literally be in the exact same position that we ended last year and got Kenny sacked. And it's not like we played terrible football last year, sure we had a fair few bad games, but when we were on song, we were playing pass and move football in the liverpool way. So what's the benchmark of success for Rodgers? Do we accept that he gets one year where anything short of relegation is fine, and then we expect to see results turn second season? What if we're 2 years of 5-8th performances and a similar sob story of bad luck, promising performances but not just enough consistency? Do we then pull the plug on the Rodgers experiment and get in a proper European manager or do we take a punt again on what we hope is our Sir Alex? I guess my point is that there's no such thing as a 'single season', everything needs to be viewed in a continuous context, and putting all our hopes on next year and a 17 year old is no different to what we've been doing for the past 3 years, and the past 20 years before that.

I mean, just how many times can we retread ""THE VERY LAST DALEKS IN EXISTENCE EVAR!!!!"" storyline, only to have their plans thwarted, their armies destroyed, and supposedly wiped from the universe? Will anyone really be surprised when they turn up again? If not, what's the point of the setup to begin with? 

It worked really well in Series 1, with a post-Time War Doctor being genuinely caught off-guard when he encountered a race he believed to have utterly annihilated at the expense of his own kind, but when RTD started to resort to having Daleks 'outside the universe' (a concept that, incidentally, causes a great deal many plot-holes that you seem accuse Moffat of having some sort of monopoly on), it may have outlived its usefulness. 

The 'Emergency Temporal Shift' was then called upon to further extend the life of this already-tired concept, resulting in two more 'Last of the Daleks' stories that succeeded in reducing the Doctor's once-powerful foes into a laughing stock, where even the mightiest of Dalek Empires could be wiped out single-handedly by Donna and a conveniently-placed keyboard. It was just pathetic.

Regardless of in-story continuity (inconsistencies which have plagued Dalek history from the word go), I applaud Moffat's decision to move towards a different Dalek setup. A fully-fledged Dalek Empire has almost limitless possibilities, far more so than yet more 'Very Last Daleks Ever' stories that would inevitably result from retaining RTD's worn-out setup.

I'm 30 years old and sterile now because of the bone marrow transplant that was used to treat my leukemia. My wife and I already have a son (who was 13 months old when I was diagnosed; he's 3 now) and we knew sterility was likely so we banked sperm beforehand, giving us a chance to have more children like we had planned. But still, the report that came back showing ""no sperm present"" and confirming that I was sterile was a pretty big emotional blow for both of us. The ability to create life is an important part of the human experience in my opinion, so the loss of that ability was painful. And even though I could never look at my son and feel cheated, and we still have a chance through IVF and are both open to adoption, it still hurts. And it feels like a part of myself has died.

I mean, they got back together so quickly, which leads me to believe that the fight included everything that makes their relationship troublesome. They were definitely fighting for a while, and Amy probably just jumped to the conclusion that kicking him out was the best option. She's not the brightest, and it was probably also a cry for help for the Doctor. I completely agree with your original post. In fact, it was a beautifully written description of what was going through her mind. I'm just adding the idea that the fight probably also included a multitude of things. Amy's infertility was the tipping point of that mountain. It took them until they were in danger (like always) to realize that ""God, we're being so stupid.""

I also want to add that this fight is definitely not over. Sure, Rory is back in the house, but they have a lot of stuff to work on if they want to function properly as a married couple. Whether this means having children (through adoption or magical time fixing powers) or not, they are still in an unhealthy relationship.

I think it's painfully obvious that The Silence was behind it. This, as well as the voice, wouldn't be that hard to explain though, so I'm just being patient for more information to come in the future. 

The ""Predator"" name doesn't seem like that big of a deal to me. It's just a name they would have made up at some point in reference to The Doctor. It's equivalent to The Oncoming Storm, a name that the Daleks apparently have for him but never say. 

And yes, he has a time machine to go back and stop them but he never really seems to know where they are. All of the Daleks he's run into after the Time-War have been scattered throughout time and he's only run into them by chance. He *could*, I guess, go back in time and destroy their origins and prevent their creation, etc. but we've been down that road already. The one question I do admit to perplexing is where a whole parliament came from. That's way more than he's encountered lately and that got away from him. My best guess, from past evidence, is they used something similar to the progenitor to create more. 

Even so, none of these questions impede the progression of the story for me. These are just things left unanswered, but I wouldn't go as far to call them plot holes. The lore, where it is now, still makes sense without them being answered just yet. I think my calm about it might come from faith in the show though. This is unlike any other show that I assume will be over in 3 or 4 years from now. I see this show have endless possibilities to answer these things in the future, so I'm just being patient with the knowledge that we won't see it end with an abundance of unanswered questions after only a few more seasons (series).

1. There have been multiple releases of different seasons.  For instance, you can get a ""Part One"" and a ""Part Two"" of Season 6.

2. The christmas episodes, as well as the Tennant post-Season 4 Specials, were sold separately for some time.

3. There were Complete Season box sets, which means repeat sales.

4. There was a box set *specifically* for the Tennant years, and there will likely be one for the Smith years.  More repeat sales

5. I neglected to ask how much money the Beeb gets from streaming to Netflix and such.

6. It is very likely that the Beeb gets a limited amount of DVD and streaming money in the first place.  Some has to go to the vendor (ex: Best Buy), some to the guys who made the DVDs (ex: some Chinese company), etc.

7. iTunes, Amazon Instant (as opposed to Prime), and so much else, which allow Whovians to pick and choose (I'd buy ""Dalek,"" but keep far far away from the Farting Aliens for instance.)

8.  I forgot to separate by region.  Do Brits bother to buy the DVDs when they can just go to iPlayer instead?  That might slice into their sales, though many Americans have Netflix, so...

9. How did I not already mention The Pirate Bay?  Even if you don't believe that every download is a lost sale (I also think more people have watched Dr. Who then they would have otherwise thanks to pirating and would have simply gone without otherwise), there are probably many more Whovian fans who only know the show through illegal downloads, streaming, or watching other people's illegally obtained goods, which may depress the sales further...

...

Anyone have any idea?  I'd guess from all of this that it must be sort of limited.

Still, if  I were to guess that 1million DVD boxsets of each season were bought (I don't really know &gt;_&lt;), and conservatively guessing that each one costs $50, and supposing they only keep 25%, that comes out to...$12m per season...6 seasons...

$72m.  But that's a complete guess.  Still, makes American sales look like an afterthought.",0,1346688306,null,0,false,0,c62tzch,t3_z8xmr,t1_c62tzch,t1_c62qvlk,null,1429806314,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

I think he has a story he wants to tell, and when he can't figure out how to get from one part to the next, he makes up a bunch of nonsensical shit to fill in the gap.

I've been upset with the treatment of this whole situation with Melody as a baby being stolen since it happened. The Doctor promises on his life that she would be safe, and he lied. Not only that but as Amy and Rory are shown to be distressed over the horrific circumstances of her birth and kidnapping, they are persuaded to fly off on another adventure! Seriously? That's when I got roundly pissed at Moffat for demeaning the parenting relationship. I am a mom with two wonderful daughters. It would have killed me had I not been able to know they were safe and healthy. I used to sneak into their room at night just to watch them sleep. Amy and Rory didn't give their child up for adoption, she was stolen. Nothing would have stopped me from looking for that child forever, and yet, there they were on a pirate ship. Very very poor character development. 

Some people say Moffat is misogynistic, others say he's writing strong female characters. I have no problem with Amy being a strong character, but she's written as wholly selfish and uncaring.

true,redem,null,null,"&gt; I think you are underestimating the impact of what could be total surveillance

I disagree, I expect it to be highly impactful, just not in the days you do. I expect fleets of drones over every city, along the main roads, and around the cost lines, tracking unknown or suspicious vehicles and people.

What I do not expect is for it to be the unveiling of a hidden cabal of creepy old white dudes with nefarious purposes and corrupt souls.

&gt; I'm sure you will be aware of the recent union black list that made the news. Imagine having drones that can record and process (not necessarily locally) all the faces in a protest. Imagine if that information never went a way. 

As long as no crime takes place, this is covered already under existing laws. If you believe the police here are breaking those then that is the issue at hand, not the drones.

&gt; That's some serious power, something despots get wet dreams about.

They would also have wet dreams over plentiful, cheap fusion electricity. That doesn't make it bad, just useful.

He had broken in through the sliding glass doors which lead to my living room (which was joined to my bedroom) so the noise was quite obvious. I was surprisingly alert and had gotten straight out of bed and thrown some jeans and trainers on while I listened to someone very obviously opening up the glasses doors from the inside. 

I didn't actually have anything that I could use as a weapon in my bedroom so I just held the door closed and kind of hoped he would think it had a lock (genius, I know). My girlfriend at the time was there so I didn't want to do anything stupid that would expose us. When he got inside I assumed he thought there would be more through here and he tried to force the door I was holding closed. Unfortunately as he was stronger he pulled the door open despite my efforts and when he saw me he punched me in the head pretty hard.

However this worked in my favour as I'm pretty sure he broke his hand punching me in the head as he didn't try hitting me again and we had one of those ridiculous brawls where no one really gets anywhere. 

The end result though was my TV got broken in the scuffle as he was a big bloke and a few minor bits of cosmetic damage to my place. The fight just kind of ended after we came to a standstill and he just bolted.

When I was 22 I've had a similar situation in having to get someone to leave (he was absolutely hammered) and had just walked into my flat corridor at around 2amish. He had come up the stairwell, passed other flats, and as I'm at the end of the stairs I guess that's where he wanted to go. He started banging the door to open up so I grabbed a bat and just threatened him to get out. Which he did without almost any incident until we got down to the bottom landing, as I wanted to make sure he left, and he rushed at me to try and take the bat off me. It's a narrow corridor so I wouldn't been able to swing it at all but I was able to uppercut it quite sharply into his chin then follow it up with an over arm swing into his head. 

I moved fairly shortly after that as I didn't feel that safe being there anymore after that run in.

All in all it's anecdotal in both instances I know. While I  was attacked first (although in the second one I was the more threatening party initially for being armed - I did judge the guy and deem it worth taking the bat with me) those situations have make me very unsympathetic to those home intruders. You don't sleep easy for awhile when these things happen to you and both times those situations could have been much worse.

true,supermeerkat,pertwee,Pertwee,"The David Tennant era of it, yes, but not the Christopher Ecclestone era. I know it's an unpopular opinion to have on /doctorwho/, but I don't care for David Tennant as an actor, RTD's later scripts or his choice of companions for the Doctor.

When DT was announced back in 2006 (I think) , I went and watched everything the man has acted in and I wasn't impressed: I found him to be wooden and lacking in charisma, a one note actor lacking gravitas or charm. As the Doctor I found him to have only three modes: manic, thoughtful or sad. 

RTD's choice of assistant number 2, I thought was uninspired, lifeless and monotone. Catherine Tate, a woman whose ""comedy"" career I was familiar with and did not like, was written as ""mouthy"" and ""feisty"" and in terms of personality was as flat as the paper her lines were written on. And then Rose came back, a character I liked under CE, as he had enough gravitas as an actor to enhance her performance, but she quickly took over the show under DT, with the Doctor often becoming a secondary character. Captain Jack was interesting as an over sexed investigator from the future, but soon became a grating one note stereotype, which is a shame as JB is a good actor, and can do so much better than that.

I consider RTD's latter scripts tended towards sentimentality and vague ideas not properly fleshed out with ideas tossed out and discarded just as quickly. In short, missing the point of what Doctor Who was about - time travel build around the quirky persona of a time traveling eccentric, and *his* adventures, not the adventures of his mouthy sidekick with the lead character reduced to a supporting role with a bit of angst about loving her and needing humans around to keep him sane. It felt like generic sci-fi drama with a dusting of Doctor Who added as an afterthought.

I've been watching Doctor Who since the early 1970's (I can remember watching episode 6 of John Pertwee's The Time Monster on a black and white television, and missing the ending due to a power cut), and have mixed views on the whole series, some actors and producers I have liked, others not so much or downright hated. With regards to Producers, Barry Letts work I like, John Nathan Turner's I don't, Philip Hinchcliffe I do, latter Graham Williamson I don't.

Perhaps I don't understand the new Doctor Who, or it's not aimed at me or I'm just old and stuck in the past, but I've tried to outline my reasons for disliking a large part of the RTD era. It's a long a rambling reply, and take it as you will, but simply put I don't like the David Tennant era of Doctor Who due to the actor chosen, the major supporting cast and the choices made by the producer with regard to scripting and tone.

TDKR Spoilers Ahead:

One of the running themes leading to Bruce's capture by Bane was his lack of motivation.  He had lost his motivation to be Batman over those long years of hiding.  He'd either become too fearful or lost all of his fear of being the Batman.  He was no longer quick enough to properly fight crime.

Then Bane broke him, not just physically but symbolically.  This breaking represents the final break of Bruce's will to be Batman.

Then Bane motivated him again.  Gave him a reason to fight by showing him the hell Gotham was being put through and by assuring him of Gotham's imminent destruction.  This rekindled the fire in Bruce.  That montage is Bruce rebuilding his will and his ability.  Rising like a phoenix to face this new threat.

The rising through the pit represents ones willingness to sacrifice.  The use of a tether shows you are unworthy because you are unwilling to sacrifice yourself to get out, or for whatever you are escaping for.  That's why the tether is too short.  If you notice, before Bruce attempts the jump the first time he tugs on the rope and it doesn't have much slack.  In fact, it doesn't have enough to reach the rock.  You have to show you are willing to sacrifice yourself to get out of the prison in order to escape.  It is only once Bruce is willing to sacrifice himself again that he is able to be Batman and succeed in saving Gotham.

I think this is to create more spots in the midfield for the new talent and also to allow Romeu to prosper.

Although the companions we caught a glimpse of in the past turned out to be similar to their intros. A little more written out, of course, and they grew as characters, but they started off similarly.  I do hope that this new companion is very similar to Oswin, if not some how Oswin. The Doctor would have to mess with time to make it possible. He never met her outside of the Dalek, so he wouldn't know what he was doing if he takes Oswin on as his companion. But not sure how time itself would feel about it. His taking her on as a companion means she learns who he is, and in this episode she didn't know him. And the Daleks had him on file, so it would've struck home who he was to her. Then his time line would change a bit because in this ep, after he went to her past. Of course, the Dalek transformation could've taken her memory away from her because it would remove love.  
She also was talking to her mom. At least to the recorder she was. So it is completely possible that the Doctor (going by the intros of the past companions, Donna excluded) could find his way into her mother's timeline and take her as a companion. And quite a bit of the time children take on aspect of their parents.  
And that got me thinking a little more, and this is far fetched to the extreme, but who in the current series does she remind you of? Maybe a bit of the Doctor and a bit of River?

I'm not saying that killing somebody with a gun is as simple as thinking ""Die"". I am well aware that it is difficult to become skilled and accurate with a firearm.

However you are completely missing my point when I say that firearms are unique because *anybody* can develop that skill. It requires no strength or physical fitness to fire a gun. It's pure dexterity. Every other handheld weapon requires the user to be physically fit. Take this example:  
I'm attacked by two men with knives. One man is a trained soldier at the peak of phsical fitness, and the other is an obese whale. In all honesty I don't have to worry much about the fat one - I'm faster stronger and better than him.

Compare that to if they both had guns: Well oh shit you've just doubled the amount of danger I'm in because I have to take both men seriously. The fact that I have a fitness advantage on one of them is irrelevant with guns. *That* is my point.

&gt;Mythbusters, who showed that unless the gun is drawn, cocked, safety off and already aiming, a knife is faster within 21 feet! You can't outrun it at all if somebody is intent on stabbing you.

FWIW you have no idea how fast I am or how fast my hypothetical attacker is. However if a guy pulls a knife on me and says ""Gimmi your wallet"" I *might* be able to outrun him. If he pulls out a gun then I can't out run the bullet. IDK why you think a mugger wouldn't have the weapon drawn already.

Then bam, in about ten seconds the whole thing is resolved. It was a gimmick, and you know, I don't think Doctor Who NEED crappy gimmicks like that. 

And on top of that, it WAS crappy writing. We were literally never shown any of this until the 10-second ""No I love YOU more"" scene. We saw them have a fight and Rory walk out the door with his coat, then Amy sad. It was, as someone said Saturday, zero to divorce in a heartbeat. And after EVERYTHING they have been through together, all the supposed character growth, suddenly Amy forgets that she can just *talk* to her husband, and decides that it's better to hurt him than disappoint him? I just can't buy it. 

Yes, infertility can cause strains to marriage. Yes, it's an awful thing for a woman to have to go through. Yes, adoption is a very different process from giving birth.

The show doesn't take itself as seriously as RTD's era, and has a sly sense of humour but has a growing tendency towards self parody, as well as trying to play up the Doctor as being a wacky eccentric (peforming backing vocals, surfing on lava are etc). The scripts are an improvement on RTDs but rely heavily on the deus ex machina of the sonic screwdriver, and have a tendency quickly wrapping up or glossing over plot points, for example, I consider that ""killing"" the doctor was a cheap trick, and the bit with the robot replacement was rather obvious

Matt Smith I like as the Doctor, I consider him to be a more accomplished actor (if you haven't seen ""Christopher and his kind"" you should)  than DT and plays the Doctor with a little more depth, humour and range.

true,UltraMegaMegaMan,null,null,"What I'm saying is a few seasons ago the beheaded merchant (whose name I forget) mentioned ""what is the question that must not be asked? Doctor Who?"" (I'm paraphrasing). So in this episode 2 things happen: the doctor finds out that the daleks become more dangerous the more they know about him, due to their extreme fear of him, and the daleks memory of the doctor is completely wiped theoretically resulting in the least dangerous version of the daleks in history.

The doctors misstep at the end of the episode where he pops out of the tardis on the bridge of the dalek ship and reminds them of his existence causes them to begin asking the question ""Doctor Who?"" Presumably they will now make an effort to find out who the Doctor is again, and become more dangerous as they succeed in doing so. So one of the doctors goals will presumably be to stop this from happening as he would prefer less dangerous daleks to more dangerous ones.

So if you wanted an entire race to stop asking a question, and to forget what they know, what possible allies could you conscript or coerce? Perhaps a race known as The Silence, with the power to make others forget? Yes I know their power is to make others forget themselves, but maybe that's all we've seen but not all they can do. 

It's a loose connection that probably means nothing I just thought there was a possibility the name and abilities of the Silence were particularly relevant to the Daleks asking the question ""Doctor Who?"" as they attempt to regain their memory of the Doctor and in so doing become more dangerous.

Whereas a gravity beam is more like... it hurls you at the target at high speeds, without dematerializing (hence why during the beam-down it actually *showed* the three of them in the beam), then pulls back the speed *just* enough that you're not smashed to a fine pinkish paste (if you're human/similar, or scrap metal and a little 'Dalek jelly' if you're a Dalek) at the bottom.

And yeah, the overlapping full-backs are a relic from those days, since we needed to get the numbers into the opposition box super-quick when on the counter.

When you look at the comfort levels vis-a-vis areas on the pitch, this disparity becomes even clearer - Rami at RM is more comfortable than Rami at RW and Bertrand at LM is more comfortable than Bertrand at LW. 

The problem, however, is that the sports channels insist on portraying Ramires at RW (rather than RM, which is where he usually ends up spending most of his time on the pitch) thereby propagating the false notion that Rami plays RW for Chelsea.

1. Two semester years. You take 4-6 classes between September and January, then have mid year exams on those, then take another 4-6 classes february until May/June, then have end of year exams on those.

2. Three term years. You have an autumn, spring and summer term, each with maybe 4 classes, each with its own assessments, and then some extra end of year assessments in June sort of time which cover the whole year.

Every course is different in the number of hours per week you are expected to be in lectures, seminars or, labs tutorials. A science subject (I just finished biology) had usually (per course) 4 hours of lectures, an hour of tutorials and 2 hours of labs per week, as well as private study and assessments. If you're doing 4 courses in a term that's about 25 hours a week in University.

If you are an international student you will probably be registered at your lectures, seminars etc, so you WILL have to show up or get kicked out, some universities are lax on this but recently one university got its VISA license taken away for not registering its international students so they are all having to be more strict.

true,SickSystem,lfc55,,"I think whether Owen is booed or not is very much a secondary concern he has played for top level teams but not played top level football for 5 years.

His injury record is frankly eye watering. It would be an extreme measure of Liverpool's desperation for us to indulge in such a player. Personally I am still unconvinced we are that desperate.

Owen as a person seems somewhat deluded and eager to remain in the public eye. His ask Michael Owen twitter escapade was cringe worthy and his unnecessary  but constant rhetoric of looking only for a premier league club smells strongly of desperation. I also remember the much publicized dossier his agent sent round to clubs before the united move.

The whole idea of Owen coming back makes my skin crawl a bit. I could imagine the media having a field day with it increasing the pressure on Rodgers and if Owen were to ship a lucrative loan deal an then get injured...

Really shouldn't need to mention why he is disliked by Liverpool fans. Sum it up quickly. Dismissed the clubs future chances under Benitez, left with a ballon d'or for pocket money to Real. Possibly was coming back to us from real after being mad surplus to requirements and took another big pay check off Newcastle. Got injured a fuck ton and somehow found himself supping at the teat of Ferguson only to again be shipped out for being injured by Vidic's cheap aftershave constantly.

The basic errors are also just hilarious. He spends about 15 minutes asking where the olive groves and sheep herders come from in the Quran , when it's a dry desolate desert place and there was no agriculture. Thus , there was no Mecca, Mecca came afterwards. 

Three things: a) desert populations live near water resources, Mecca has water resources, thus it could support agriculture quite happily as well as herd animals; Mohammed also spent time in Medina/Yathrib which was also a famed community of small holders and farmers - he confirms it existed in his book by referring the ""constitution of Medina"" and c) Meccans were caravan traders and merchants and they traded olive oil and other such luxury items - especially when the infighting between Byzantium and Sassanid cut silk road traffic to parts of the Roman Empire. 

These are all provable via outside sources and texts, such as records of these places before Mohammed's time via the Ethiopian excursions into the region and records from Roman archives.

In regards to Owen. Will he strengthen the squad? Yes, yes he will undoubtedly. So i can put aside my dislike for the way he treated the club, as i know him being here again will strengthen the team and better the club. You wont see me cheering his name, but similarly you wont see me booing.

She, and Amy to a lesser extent have been portrayed as caricatures of women, ciphers, if you will. They have been reduced to tropes.

true,TerminalxSound,tardis,TARDIS,"Yeah. Just for the sake of clarity for anyone who might read this, I'm going to address some of the points that were written about.

""So Rory and Amy never thought to, I don’t know, actually have a thought out conversation about the state of their relationship, or think about adopting? Or think about any of the other thousands of perfectly feasible solutions to their stupid problems""

It did feel quite rushed, a bit less so with the Pond Life insights, but not too much. I don't think it's the end of that subplot by any means, hell, it might not even be the beginning. Timey-wimey. Anyway, Amy is notoriously bad [horrible, actually the worst] at communication. She decided on a unilateral ""best"" course of action for Rory and implemented it without consulting him- bad plan, but more or less in character. Adopting is not a magical solution to the larger problem of infertility, hopefully that is obvious. The pain and disappointment Amy feels as a woman and a wife will still have to be waded through. I certainly wouldn't call their problems ""stupid"", Amy and Rory already have enough problems without this new one to make tons of real world couples split and they don't all have even one feasible solution, but they should definitely be talking about them, yes.

Moffat needs to come up with more plot solutions that just “Hey this person is a genius and did clever things so the problem is solved 

I actually saw the twist as a counter to that argument. If she had just been human, it would have been, ""Hey I'm clever and I can do everything"" but being dalek was a legitimate reason for her to have access to the things she did. That being said, her conversion certainly gave her an edge on systems management, but she was already very, very clever. During her flashbacks it's revealed that the daleks chose her for a full conversion because they recognized her genius and knew that they needed it. This is also why I trust her character WOULD HAVE done the whole ""ctrl-alt-del"" thing if it were at all possible, or reprogrammed them to stop killing things and start wearing tutus, but some things are pretty fundamentally ingrained into the species.

The Doctor is also The Predator now? I thought he was The Oncoming Storm? Come on Daleks just pick a dumb pseudonym and stick with it. 

This could also be a result of the Doctor going into hiding at the end of series 6. In the Christmas special he's called The Caretaker, and now this. I wouldn't be surprised if a new name were introduced each episode and evolved into some form of mind-blowing Moffatry.

How come the Daleks never utilized this nanobot technology to disguise themselves before? That would seem awfully useful. 

Nanobots aren't really useful as a disguise mechanism. Think back to The Empty Child, they're used as healers. The entire plot of that episode is that the nanogenes had gotten the wrong ""blueprint"" and started applying it to everyone, I see the same thing here- they were programmed to treat daleks and therefore tried their best to turn everything non-dalek as dalek as possible. Plus, they would never stoop so low as to adopt human form. Humans are icky and daleks are supreme and pure. xP

Where the hell did Sexy come from? 

Probably teleported like Amy and Rory were. Or Martha (and some other people) in that other episode with the Osterhoceksjtgksh r German named key thing. They just left it there because they probably wanted to study/use it and the Doctor was just sent to his doom on an exploding planet so, you know, super villain complex kicks in.

I guess Democracy is good enough for the Daleks now. 

The whole concept of ""My gang is bigger than your gang, so I'm in charge now"" seems Dalek enough to me.

Why don’t they just roll up in their fleet of seemingly millions out of nowhere, and just blow up all the planets whose populations they were created to exterminate.  


They do do that a lot off screen, but it's just not as entertaining as seeing the Doctor stop them all the times he manages to.

“Why did the Doctor have a veritable break down because a few angry geriatric Daleks with no weapons decided to edge towards him at tortoise speed.” 

The Time War had a greater effect on the Doctor than most people seem to realize. 9 in particular shows signs of being extremely afflicted with PTSD. If you watch the first season episode Dalek, his reaction is much the same. Especially since those particular daleks were ones he had personally faced already, some in that very war.

In conclusion, there is A LOT of talk about plot holes floating around, but you seem to be forgetting much of how season 6/Moffat operated.

The Asylum was a threat because someone was inside, and they could possibly shut down the forcefield and unleash an army of defective Daleks.

Maybe one can access it if small enough? The crashed ship wasn't very big, and they might have sent the defective Daleks to the planet one by one.

Because a few nukes might just sterilize the surface, whereas the asylum is inside. Or, the nukes would just blow the planet to pieces leaving some Daleks in tact.

An army of insane Daleks could potentially be a threat to the Dalek Empire itself. For example, that one Dalek hacks into Dalek technology and does things like cause havoc in the asylum and deleting the doctor from the Dalek mainframe.

Maybe they could, but they didn't want to. (Why save the doctor?)

The Daleks weren't necessarily afraid, they were just protecting themselves. Or rule #1.

Daleks have shown themselves to adhere to a hierarchy: Emperor Dalek, Dalek Supreme, etc. The parliament is another example.

Ok, I'll bite. [Here's the extended highlights I will be using for reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVPuYoByqsY).

**First goal:** It wasn't a stupid pass. It was a long-ball to Torres who seemed to be between the lines when the pass was made. Even after Mikel's tackle-slash-interception goes astray, Lamps does not drop back to cover for Mikel. IMO, Lamps should have dropped back to crowd/mark Falcao when Mikel ran up to intercept the headed return. The subsequent 2v2 imbalance in the center channel resulted in a swift counter-attack consisting of two passes and a perfect chip that resulted in a goal - all in a matter of EIGHT seconds. EIGHT seconds, mind you. 

Atletico's immediate &amp; urgent pressing **PLUS** a lackadaisical pressing approach on our side **PLUS** Lampard's wayward positioning is what caused the subsequent goal. 

**Second Goal:** The defensive shape is much better than the first here but it disintegrates real quickly. This time, Lamps is desperately trying to defend super-heroically and tries to take on all Atletico players one-by-one. Watch as he pings back and forth between the two Atletico Madrid players trying to steal the ball from them and then, he suddenly gives up just as Mikel comes in to help him out at [1:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVPuYoByqsY&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=66s). Too late, because Atleti have taken advantage of the confusion between the two and snuck in behind the lines. Immediately after, Falcao is set up with a brilliant through ball. 

Watch how Ashley Cole is caught in two minds and ends up giving Falcao a whole second to stop, look, line up and shoot from [1:07 to 1:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVPuYoByqsY&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=67s). Actually, this one was a peach of a goal by Falcao, full credit to him.

**Third goal:** This brought back memories of the Barcelona match and the entire goal - from defense to attack - took Atletico Madrid less than twenty seconds to score.

At every attacking corner, the two CBs and Brana push up into the melee looking for headers - that's the way our set-pieces are designed. Mikel stays at the center line to (supposedly) cut off any wayward balls that arrive out of the box. 

At [2:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVPuYoByqsY&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=130s), however, Atletico get a lucky break - the ball lands perfectly for one of the Atletico players to lay it forward to another marauding Atletico player - much as Ashley laid it forward to Nando at the Camp Nou. The break is on and 3 Atletico players are running full speed ahead and Falcao isn't even in the picture! 

By the time the first Chelsea player arrives at the D, it is a 4v4. Mikel, Ashley, Cahill &amp; Ramires arrive - in that order and form a tight defensive line. By the time our other holding midfielder (Lamps) arrives into the frame at [2:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVPuYoByqsY&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=139s) Atletico have already overloaded our box and it is a 6v5 - no sign of Brana or Luiz yet. Falcao has, meanwhile, crept up on the left side which is being 'guarded' by Ramires. He receives yet another perfect through ball/pass which he converts without even breaking stride. (Well, almost.)

When it is a 6v5 in YOUR half of the pitch, the best you can do is hold a tight defensive line and hope the opposition make a mistake. I cannot fault Mikel for doing nothing here because that's exactly what he was expected to do given the situation.

Should we have tried to nip the attack in the bud? Maybe. Should Ashley have tried to tackle the Atletico player as he came barreling out of the gate down their right (and our left) wing? Maybe. Would it have worked? Maybe. I dunno, honestly.

The bigger question, however, is this: In all the three goals, Falcao has had a 'free run' into each of the positions where he scored the goals from. WHY THE HELL WASN'T HE MARKED THROUGHOUT THE MATCH? Where was the urgency? Where was the pressing? Where was the desire that was so evident in the matches against Barca &amp; Bayern? o_O

Well you were quite ambiguous about the whole thing, so sorry for not being able to fully comprehend all the obnoxious bullshit that spews forth from your craphole. Perhaps if you had actually made a reference to Arsenal selling their best players as being your main criticism then I would have been able to understand better eh? Twat.

&gt;You don't sell players like Fabregas, van Persie and Song to bring in others, you sell them because you're bullied helplessly into it. 

Song has 3 years on his contract, he was happy to stay at the club as he acknowledged, but we didn't want to offer him a pay rise yet. Arsenal made the decision to sell him to Barcelona when they came in with an offer that met our valuation, so you're wrong on that one.

Fabregas and van Persie forced the club to sell, what could Arsenal have done about it? 

How about we talk about your club for a change. You spend so much money yet never win anything, nor even come close to winning, your best players leave you as well and even your best aren't good enough for Arsenal, you haven't won anything significant in decades, you're essentially a mediocre club in every way, so why try to criticise Arsenal? You're all so arrogant and obnoxious, but about what exactly? 

Just shut up, be humble and support your club for a change. Accept that Arsenal are the superior club in every way and then maybe I'll take you seriously.

I, on the other hand, can't stand these things.  Every show I finish, I'm disgruntled, like watching someone dump pudding (errr... custard) on my grandmother and laughing about it.  It's not the end of the world, but I'm not pleased with it and it irritates me.  Any time I bring that up, people say it's because it's not targeted to me, it's for children, and plot holes and inconsistencies are fine *in that context*.  I'm willing to give them that, but that doesn't have to mean I like it.

I also have to seriously question the ""less soap opera"" crap; the Rory+Amy bullcrap is even thicker and more annoying than any amount of Rose + 10 crap we had to see.  The thing is, I don't mind Amy as a character - I don't think she's written to be a particularly strong character (in terms of depth or complexity, I mean - I consider her more a plot device than anything else), but she's alright.  But I positively loathed Rose, and I'd've been happier if the Doctor's companion were the wheelie bin from Episode 1 of the reboot.  But, I still feel like the Amy+Rory stuff is laid on so thick that it must at *least* cast some doubt on the soap opera part.

true,soccerholic1816,null,null,"First Goal: That isn't the type of pass we should be playing into Torres, he isn't Drogba. That really isn't important though. Had Lampard gone and covered behind Mikel, there would've been a massive hole in the midfield where Lampard was. If there was another player the should've been helping back, it should have been Ramires. He was closest and in the best position to mark the guy that received the pass. Either way, that doesn't change the fact that Mikel hardly put any effort in to get back and put pressure on the guy. I'm not trying to say why Mikel was at fault for these goals, all I'm saying is he is a lazy player that could've done more in preventing these goals.  
  
Second goal: You say Mikel came in to help him out, but he didn't really do much to get in the way. You could even argue that he should have been marking one of those two players in the first place, instead of Lampard running between the two. And then you say Lampard is the one who gives up? He stops for a second before continuing to run back, while Mikel just walks back. Lampard definitely put in more work on that play, and wasn't helped in the least by Mikel.  
  
Third goal: I'm just going to ignore anything that isn't about Mikel here (not because I disagree with you, but because I only intended to talk about Mikel's performance). As soon as the first four get back, Mikel and Cahill are standing literally right next to each other, and both Ramires and Cole are also pretty close by. Mikel isn't adding anything being where he was, and as soon as Cahill got back into position, he should've stepped up to pressure the ball.

true,ihatephilosophy,lfc99,,"I always assumed it would be easier to rebuild this way with transfers as opposed to the draft. 

In a draft, the worse you do the higher pick you get. In basketball, they use a lottery while in American football it is worst finish gets first pick. The draft goes in rounds. Basketball is two rounds. American football is seven. Other sports, I'm not sure. I think baseball is like 30 or something. Teams also trade draft picks for players. So a player in his prime may be worth a few draft picks.

With transfers, it seems there is a lot of flexibility on who you can target. You aren't locked into what players are available in the draft at the time when you get to choose nor do you have to give up players to get better picks.

I guess our rebuilding is following the American plan well. We have  Gerrard and Carragher at the end of their years playing a mature role on the team. Agger, Skrtel, Johnson, Lucas, Suarez and Reina in their prime and keep us from fearing relegation. Then the rest of the players are young guys getting experience now who will begin to reach their prime as the guys in their prime now are on the downside of their career. And in playing these younger players, we will find gems like Allen and Sterling who can step in and contribute right away.

I don't know if it makes sense, but as far as rebuilding--American style--this is pretty much an ideal situation. I guess the only real hole that needs to be addressed right away is the lack of someone that can score a goal. I'm assuming a cheap, will-play-for-money type stop gap will be looked at now. I know it seems unpopular, but Owen is the type of player an American owner would look at. In it for the money, has played in similar systems, and isn't there to be a hero so when he is gone next year or benched in favor of Morgan, Borini, or Yesil, no one will be sad to see him go.

I hope this sheds some light to the American mindset of the direction the club is going.

At what point should a defensive midfielder be either out of position or reluctant to stay in front of the back four? Never...so surely Luiz's defensive 'flaws' or 'weaknesses' would also be the same things that let him down playing further forward? 

The only REAL solution at present would appear to be Romeu. An out and out defensive midfielder, who is happy to sit back, hold and throw in a challenge when needed. He is raw, and he is inexperienced, but with no Raul and no Essien what other choice do we have?

He explained he'd just been to the conservative convention near the library and was going back to Westminster. I said ""oh..bye then""

And that was that. He smiled some more, I patted him on the back and said ""I wish you no luck in the election"", and he wandered off.

Syrian intervention is blatantly all about removing any allies Iran has so they're an easier target, it has nothing to do with helping the general public. If it did there are a whole heap of regimes the west wouldn't be directly supporting or saying very little about.

The bottom line is that AVB still doesn't even have a *starting XI* that can play his preferred system, let alone the depth to deal with multiple competitions.  We only moved for AVB's #1 target on deadline day and so failed to handle some fairly routine snags, and it may just have doomed the first half of our season.

true,Mozza215,lfcflame,,"&gt;We blew a huge transfer kitty last year (over £100m)

When I said this, I was referring to the money we spent on players that were ultimately hugely overvalued and quite poor: Downing, Carroll, Adam, and I'm still undecided on Henderson. I was actually using the response you just provided to try and convince my mates we hadn't ""overspent"" on Carroll. Simple answer is, we did. 

&gt;In the end West Ham got Carroll, Fulham got the price they wanted for Dempsey, and we're the team that has been made a mockery of.

Okay yes, fair enough, we have ended up looking a bit silly. However, although it was almost a given that Dempsey would end up a Liverpool player, I'm still glad we didn't buy him. He's 29, and hasn't been **that** consistent as a goalscorer. Last season was the first time he'd scored over 20 goals. We need a goalscorer yes, but is someone who is 29 and has had one good season the best choice? I'm not sure.

In regards to our striking threat, yes, early signs aren't good. But I reckon (and I'm really hoping) Borini 'clicks' soon, and Suarez finally finds the net on a regular basis instead of missing so many easy chances. As someone on here said, ""Suarez hardly does the easy things, and easily does the hard things."" I will agree with the bench point, the camera panned on it and I was seriously worried when I saw what poor depth we had attacking wise. However, I'm always very supportive of youngsters until they prove me otherwise, so I'm hopeful that the youth coming through will do well (although experience is always nice, but then again if we look at Owen, we'll have that experience won't we?). 

&gt;But what exactly are we calling a success anymore?

This year, success to me would be a top 6 finish, a solid cup run (two solid cup runs? Maybe three!) and very clear signs that Rodgers' philosophy and style are being adopted and taken on well by our players. I have total confidence in Rodgers, but if it takes half a season, or a full season to get his influence properly instilled into the side, then so be it, I won't moan, I won't gripe, I'll let him get on with it. If we finish next season in 6th, 7th or 8th, then yes we need to be asking questions, but we're in serious transition now. This isn't like before, this is **it**. This is the season where the owners have realised success does not come overnight, it does not come in one season, it does not come from one player. I **want** us to take our time, I want Liverpool to be a steady club that doesn't have to splash tens of millions on one player to bring them success. We're building a strong side that consists of a lot of ""inside"" players, players that Rodgers wants and knows will fit his style of football. Taking one season to find the right players, and that right balance can't be a bad thing, surely?

&gt;I would have gone with ""at the end of a storm, there's a golden sky"" ;)

true,notsmartatall,null,null,"again, because apparently new whovians prefer to speculate about things without actually paying attention to the show...

rory is not the master. why? because even the master is no longer the master. the events of ""the end of time"" when you find out that the master has been the way he is because of the timelords putting the sound of drums into his head is what made him what he was. but that is no longer the issue.

plus he's locked in the fucking time war.

&gt;River is half Time Lord. Did anyone ever think that whole ""concieved during flight"" explaination was entierly satisfying? I felt not.

exposure to the time vortex is what made the timelords become timelords. it makes the conceived during flight explanation make completely perfect sense.

&gt;In The God Complex, Rory is the only one who didn't find a room for himself, and the Doctor says ""Of course it would be you"" when he opens his door. We then hear the TARDIS cloister bell, which is heard when the Master is about to steal the TARDIS.

a better explanation is that what the doctor saw in the room was the tardis and nothing else, which makes his comment even more logical. and going further why would rory not finding a room be the reason why he's a timelord when the doctor, who is a timelord, had a room?

&gt;We know things have fallen through the cracks in time, so why not the Master/ Rory? How else would he get out the time lock? We never got an explaination for why they opened.

i'm not sure we're watching the same show. the cracks were caused by the exploding tardis, fixed by flying the pandorica into the heart of the explosion. and if the master escaped the timewar through the crack, wouldn't the cracks then seal behind him because of him being a complicated space-time event?

&gt;Rory has died again and again and always come back again. Just like the Master.

the master regenerated. rory didn't. the master died and came back in a way where he was shifting between timelord and cgi skeleton that ate people. rory hasn't. plus rory died only once, in the universe before it was rebooted. other times where either dreamstates, or a ruse (like when canton shot him). his knowledge of being an auton only exists because of amy remebering the doctor.

&gt;He showed no surprise to the TARDIS being bigger on the inside.

and he explained why he wasn't impressed (literally the very same scene you refer to). and why should he? by this point he already found out that aliens are real and that things can assume the form of coma patients. he reacts logically to the situation.

&gt;When Melody regenerates into River Song, Rory clutches his head and says he has a banging in his head. This is the first time we see him exposed to the raw energy of the Time Lords.

or he has a headache from hitting his head combined with hitler banging away in the cupboard.

&gt;In Asylum of the Daleks, every time Rory is alone we hear the four drum beats in the background.

Okay, that's fair enough. But I was objecting to what you said: that Moffat can't write for children in such a way that adults can enjoy it, too. That's clearly untrue.

Until we get a return of the slitheen and fart jokes, the idea that this incarnation of the show is more condescending towards its adult audience isn't gonna fly with me. :P

&gt; ""is that the premise of some is that, because the story is targeted for Children, it doesn't matter that there are plot holes and inconsistencies so large you could drive a Sycorax ship through.

&gt; I, on the other hand, can't stand these things. Every show I finish, I'm disgruntled, like watching someone dump pudding (errr... custard) on my grandmother and laughing about it. It's not the end of the world, but I'm not pleased with it and it irritates me. Any time I bring that up, people say it's because it's not targeted to me, it's for children, and plot holes and inconsistencies are fine in that context. I'm willing to give them that, but that doesn't have to mean I like it.""

See, I think the number of ""plot holes and inconsistences"" that crop up each series is about the same as it's always been. Hell, it's only because I became numb to them during the RTD era that I'm fine just rolling with whatever the show throws at me, now. 

There's certainly stuff I don't like -- the direction they took the River was not my cup of tea at all -- but that's just because I don't like it, not because it's riddled with errors, or what have you.

The thought anyone could feel disgrunted after ""Asylum of the Daleks"" boggles my mind, though. Because that was the *most* like a bigger, better, modernised version of the classic series Nu Who has ever, EVER been. I'm not going to let an inconsistency (assuming it even is) as minor as the one addressed by OP spoil that. I'm going to laugh at it -- because it's genuinely funny -- and move on. 

&gt; ""I also have to seriously question the ""less soap opera"" crap; the Rory+Amy bullcrap is even thicker and more annoying than any amount of Rose + 10 crap we had to see. The thing is, I don't mind Amy as a character - I don't think she's written to be a particularly strong character (in terms of depth or complexity, I mean - I consider her more a plot device than anything else), but she's alright. But I positively loathed Rose, and I'd've been happier if the Doctor's companion were the wheelie bin from Episode 1 of the reboot. But, I still feel like the Amy+Rory stuff is laid on so thick that it must at least cast some doubt on the soap opera part.""

You later say you're from the US, so that might be why we got some mixed messages here. 

To clarify, I'm not referring to the show's continuing focus on interpersonal relationships but, rather, the Coronation Street/Eastenders (British soaps) vibe that ran in the background of Nu Who throughout the the RTD era. Whenever he interacted with the family of his present companion (be it Rose, Martha, or Donna) we'd tend to enter soap land. I didn't hate it, and it shone at times (particularly once Wilf was part of the cast), but I'm glad we don't get so much of it anymore.

Moffat's version of the show treads more of a line between fairy tale and space opera. And, when it *does* venture into the more mundane lives of everyday folk (The Lodger, etc) then it becomes more... sitcommy, I guess.

Uh. Okay, rambled on longer than I intended. Sorry about that. I'll leave you alone, now.

I mean, this whole thing about Moffat 'just making things up' is hilariously tragic. It's like we've accelerated to 80s-style fandom in just 7 years, which last time resulted in episodes like 'Attack of the Cybermen' and 'Warriors of the Deep' that dared not actually tread any new ground for fear of upsetting a deeply conservative fanbase.

People actually seem to be forgetting what makes Doctor Who so great. The fact that *Asylum of the Daleks* contradicts previous Dalek stories doesn't detract from the fact that this is probably the first Dalek story since *Dalek* to actually explore what makes these insane tanks tick, just like how *Genesis of the Daleks* wasn't any less groundbreakingly amazing because it contradicted stories  broadcast years earlier.

If the rot has already set in, however, then I really do fear for the show's future. I doubt Moffat is likely to buckle to the fandom's screeching, but it is possible the a future showrunner may be less willing to take the sorts of risks that are absolutely required for Doctor Who to be a continued success.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Very true - at least in the case of City and United. But Chelsea's signings, while promising on paper, have been lackluster when given a chance (except for Hazard). Hazard was absolutely shut down during the match with Atletico, while Oscar isn't very good in the Prem it seems (we may have dodged a bullet there, we'll see. He could get much better though, but it's even money whether he turns into another Gio and wants to leave for Spain after a year). Marin has a history of being injured, Thorgan Hazard seemed to be bought as a gamble, hoping he'd be as good as his brother, and I don't know enough to comment on Moses and Azpilicueta. 

In Arsenal's case, they lost RVP and Song, two major major parts of their squad, and brought in Cazorla (great signing IMO, one we should have jumped on), Podolski (history and patterns say he will be nothing short of a failure, but we'll see), and Giroud (he may be great once he finds his feet but up until now he's seemed pretty goofy up front). 

In contrast, we sold our two best players (IMO) in Modric and Van Der Vaart, which was a huge blow, but brought in one of the best CBs out there in Vertonghen, a huge prospect in Gylfi (he's maybe 80% of VdV now, but he's 7 years younger, too), one of the best GKs in the world in Lloris, and two great attacking players with a lot of grit and determination in Dembele and Dempsey. A fellow r/coys poster pointed out something very cool that I didn't notice: both Dempsey and Dembele are very determined and hard working. Neither seemed to care, at Fulham at least, who they were playing against and how badly their side were doing - they always put in 110%. Right now that's what we need. We're a side very dependent on psychology to succeed, it seems, and I believe only Gylfi and BAE approach them in determination when there's a sense of despair.

true,lokkenmor,null,null,"I don't want to be ""that guy"" but fuck it, anyone who's met me knows I *am* that guy. Besides which, this can be educational for you.

A ~~couple of~~ few things:

**1) This really isn't the place to try and beg for a flat share.**

I've seen people arrange to meet and discuss such things, but they tended to be incidental to the purpose of the conversation. They also tended to have more than half a paragraph's worth of dialogue beforehand. You need to try Gumtree or somewhere else. This ain't the right place for it.

**2) You're acting as a proxy for someone else.**

I'm generally suspicious of people soliciting in this manner anyway but that fact that you're doing if on behalf of someone else whilst giving extremely vague details about them isn't helping your case. 

&gt; ""Hes[sic] not a student"" 

I'm guessing he's not got a job either, nor have you said if he's a graduate - this could be anything.

&gt; ""coming to live in Edinburgh for a while"" 

No fixed plans.

&gt;""Preferably on the cheaper side"" 

Either can't commit to or isn't planning on providing proper financing.

**3) Why won't he be living with you?**

This is the most striking thing about your post and probably should have been number one on the list but it's the most important question you haven't answered. What circumstance's are at work here that means your brother relies on the kindness of strangers, rather than his family (who I'm assuming are already in the city)? Has he been kicked out of the house; do you have any support network here; doesn't he have any friends, or any of your friends, he could stay with? What you're not saying is filling the fuel tanks for my cynicism and suspicion.

**4) Short notice.**

Two weeks is short notice, by any standard, and no-one is going to want to take in a stray without at least having the opportunity to meet and gauge his character beforehand. I don't know if you've been looking around much lately but the flat market is, at this moment, pretty much done for the year, which suggests one reason for your post. It also suggests that your brother may be irresponsible and didn't sort out his accommodation on time, again that magnitude of an over-sight is not a trait I'd want in a flat-mate.

**5) Your presentation.**

Nothing about how you presented your post is filling me with any level of confidence in your reliability and maturity, and since you're the proxy for someone else that isn't helping his case. Smiley faces everywhere, unstructured flow, aforementioned omissions of detail, attempted punctuation and grammar. This is something that an optimistic child would write without giving thought to the consequences and the level of scrutiny this kind of request merits. If you want this to be taken seriously, then you need to start taking it seriously. Asking strangers for a place to stay is not a mother-fucking game, it's risky and dangerous for everyone involved when you've not got an independent party mediating for you.

---

Without delving further into it these are my immediate impressions of your post. You're not doing yourself, nor your brother, any favours here.

That being said, I'm a suspicious sort of guy so, maybe it's just me.

One of the things that has got cut is support for disabled people; previously [2.6m people were claiming disability benefit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incapacity_Benefit), costing £12.5bn a year, which is about half the transport budget. The government has introduced medical assessments to try and reduce these numbers by about 500,000, and they appear to have cocked it up, by subcontracting it out to feckless private sector companies. This criticism is given added poignancy by the disability-centred occasion.

In the current test, you are judge over your ability to walk 200m (amongst other things), newer version has slashed this by 75% to 50m.

People like my friend who has two prosthetic legs will no longer qualify for the upper rate of mobility - instantly removing her qualification for a specially adapted car that she can drive using hand controls (throttle etc).

I will also no longer qualify - meaning I will be housebound again as the nearest bus stop is 200m away and I can walk maybe 50-60m on a good day with 2 or 3 stops along the way.

Hence you tend to see the same teams constantly straddling the lines of success.

The reason Liverpool are in need of a rebuild now is due to overstretching ourselves to match the financial muscle of Man City, Chelsea etc, and then our owners balking at the inevitable drain upon their resources. The epitome of this was in 2009/10 when Hicks and Gillett flatly refused to strengthen the team after splashing mega-bucks on the likes of Torres and several poor players. This, coupled with Rafa Benitez's mismanagement of Xabi Alonso and the meddling of Hodgson, caused us to lose a core of our best players in an unnatural way that defied the usual pattern of slowly replacing players through youth or signings.

It's interesting to note that whilst FSG came in stating their intention not to play this game, they surely did and allowed Kenny a fairly free reign with the transfers. They got burned badly when he underachieved, and have now decided to go down the road of rebuilding slowly, without waste. I think that many LFC fans are slowly coming to terms with the fact that this season will be an unsuccessful one, but something we can build upon. 

All that said, it's difficult to look at the long-term when you're not getting results whatsoever in the short-term. I don't think there'd be such a fuss if we hadn't have been so roundly humiliated at WBA, if we'd not lost our heads against City, if we'd tucked Hearts away like the extremely inferior team that they are, and if we'd converted at least some of our possession into goals against Arsenal. I'm happy for us to rebuild, but whilst focussing on the future, you still have to control the here and now.",0,1346714340,null,0,1346714724,0,c630bmj,t3_zab7f,t1_c630bmj,t1_c62xend,null,1429809365,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

IMO there's not a better player in the prem at touching and turning, and holding the ball in tight situations surrounded by multiple opposition players.  [Here's a video from 2010/11.  He's doing things like this and better every single time he gets the ball this season so far](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T-7T2rza3k).  I forgot what the exact stat was, but in one of our previous game he went something like 60 minutes without giving away possession once, and having 30 odd consecutive completed passes. 99 percent of the time this guy will make the right choice in pass, turn, or whatnot..and that is a damn important thing for our team to have. That is simply amazing. I've only ever seen a handful, maybe even less than 5, of players in the last 10 or so years who can do what he does on the ball in the position he plays; Viera, Makelele, Pirlo.  What's more is that those 3 players have something in common.  They didn't peak until the end of their careers.  The 'makelele' role relies a lot on experience.  More so than probably most other positions on the pitch.  For him to show the quality he's shown for us already, at the age of 25, is amazing.  That means he's playing at a level only just below the most reveared DM's, and still has a good 4 years until he is at his best; hopefully.

[Compare that video of Mikel to this one of Makelele.  While Makelele obviously has more speed, experience, and better marking...you can see that their style is almost identical, and Mikel isn't far off.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaB6OsC2qdI)",0,1346715467,null,0,false,0,c630lfs,t3_zan2k,t1_c630lfs,t1_c62yljr,null,1429809496,4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,4

true,ravniel,num11,,"I still think Chelsea will be much better than last year.  I'm not at all frightened of Marin or even Moses but I think Oscar could still come good, and Hazard is obviously good enough to win games all on his own.  At least they don't have a starting XI that comes apart like an absolute house of cards when a couple players are injured - aside from striker (a position I'm confused they didn't buy for) they have a lot more depth in creative positions than we do.

Arsenal look weaker on paper, but they're still managed by Arsene Wenger and he's salvaged starts a lot worse than this one.  Podolski will be perfectly fine so long as he's played centrally and not on the wing, and Cazorla will be an absolute revelation.

I'll reserve judgment on how happy I am about Dempsey once I see where he fits.  If he can do anything on the right wing, I'm relatively pleased, as we need a goal threat on that side rather desperately (and AVB has historically preferred one).  My concern isn't necessarily that we don't have a good starting XI - it's that we don't have depth in key positions.

We're two injuries away from having to start with the lineup we used against Newcastle and West Brom, and that lineup simply isn't good enough to win games 

This is my biggest concern, too. I think the starting XI will take us to January in a pretty strong position as long as they all stay fit. The good news is we don't have too many fragile players out there. Lennon can be replaced by Dempsey, who is pretty tough it seems, and I think that may be the lineup AVB goes with anyway. Dempsey, from the highlight reels, seems pretty good at scoring from almost anywhere. I think he'll fit in well on the right side as long as he continues to cut in and act like a second striker. 

Arsenal, I would say, are still weaker than last season. Any team that loses RVP is most definitely weaker. He was so crucial for them last season that without him I think they'll have a hard time getting back into a challenging position. For much of the game against Liverpool they looked only average against a very, very under performing Liverpool side. 

Hazard seems good - very good. But the way he was shut down against Atletico can prove a lesson for everyone else. He's such a crucial player that dedicating one person to man mark him won't be a waste at all. Taking him out of the game is worth so much more than losing an extra player on the defense. Sandro would be great for this, but I think he may come at him too aggressively - we've all seen how good Hazard is at diving!

I'd love to know which outgoing is mystifying to you, really. Kane is the only one I can think of who would have been useful. I can't see him getting a lot of play at Norwich and 2 strikers isn't enough for 4 competitions. Perhaps Souleymane will have to play in Europa League.

But you look at guys like Pienaar, Kranjcar, Corluka, etc...those were players who we never had a chance of keeping. Our last manager made sure their hearts were set on leaving, so even if one of them could have been useful, not a lot we could logically do to keep them.

Our two biggest departures were again through difficult circumstances and I agree with the decision to not keep players against their will. 

I think it could be argued we should have made 1-2 more signings for depth but overall there is nothing mystifying about our departures.

If you go through and actually look at the players who have left, we've brought in a replacement (either a signing or a loanee returning) for basically every significant departure. In some cases there is a drop in quality. In others there is an improvement.

His sale made sense to me when I thought Moutinho was incoming (and according to some of the ITKs that's the only reason he was allowed to leave at all), but when that deal failed to materialize we were left sorely bereft of creativity. Right now we have essentially 2 midfield positions where serious attacking creativity is needed, and 2 players (Dembele and Gylfi) to fill them. VDV would have given us some options. Not necessarily optimal ones, but better than Livermore and Sandro as a double pivot, which is simply unacceptable. Some would hold up Dempsey as a VdV replacement but aside from an eye for goal he's not the same kind of player.

I'd also add Danny Rose to the list. I don't think he was especially good as a left back but at least he was *something*. Now what happens in the event of a BAE injury? What's the plan B? We were working on Zeki Fryers, and that didn't happen. So why was Rose allowed to go?

&gt; Our two biggest departures were again through difficult circumstances

I assume we'd both agree that Luka and VdV were our biggest departures, but what were VdV's ""difficult circumstances""? Much was made of his desire to return to Germany but I don't think that would ever have proven decisive had he been made a serious part of our plans. Which, given what we were left with, he should have been.

&gt; I think it could be argued we should have made 1-2 more signings for depth

I don't see how it would be possible to argue otherwise. I think it's absurd that we *didn't* make 1-2 more signings for depth. At least.

I say this out of personal experience. From all my time in schools, jobs and attending some public discussions, seeing students, teachers, professors, employees, managers and officials of all kind get into discussion over various subjects.

Most people go about their business without bothering others, but you always meet these people who want to be everyone's friend and when they see someone who's not as social as they are, jump in to the rescue. Regardless of whether the subject thinks his/her situation to need ""rescue"".

They have a circle of friends/colleagues, whom they get along with nicely, most of the time. The moment a struggle rises to the surface though, it's very informative to poll the opinions of involved parties. It's my experience that without fail, those people who try to do what you described, think of themselves as always correct in everything they propose. They might not have all the data yet, but their fundamental idea is correct. And they claim anyone opposing is wrong, and also claim that if opposing parties are angered by this, it further proves they're wrong. Because of the anger.

That's a fundamentally flawed concept. One's anger does not influence the validity of an idea. Anger shows you care about something and feel that the other involved parties either don't care as much, or are dismissive of something you think of as important. There might be deeper issues, but that's an other discussion. Still, it bothers me how these people are claiming to be such nice people with lofty ambitions, and when push comes to shove they act holier-than-thou and even ridicule people who oppose them sometimes.

They claim they want to be everyone's friend, but they don't really do it. They only hook up with people who agree with them, just like everybody else. People with different opinions are ""acquaintances"" at best, in the loosest definition of the term.

That is my experience.

Israel already has little issue [assassinating scientists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Israeli_assassinations) - check the 2010's, and despite all the talk Iran gave, the US had little trouble keeping Hormuz open.

2 - The Syrian intervention isn't an intervention, we aren't helping them like we did in Libya. 

3 - Atrocious violence is being committed by the Assad regime - there are numerous accounts of torture, murder, destruction which you can find easily on google across the media. Yes it's being committed by both sides, but don't insinuate the Assad is any way the good guy. 

4 - How do you help the general public in these countries? Do you fund the regime so there is at least vague stability even though the government routinely tortures, rapes, kills its own population? Do you help the rebels in their bloody uprising which will likely destabilise the country, lead to thousands of deaths but has a possibility of hope? Do you do nothing, release statements to the media calling for peace, but let both sides slice each other up like we did in Rwanda? Do you intervene, allowing your own men and women to die in the process so that elections can be held, but because you are there, any leader will be accused, justifiably or not, of being a puppet leader, the opposition will react towards you and the new government and the bloodshed continues? Do you send in the UN peacekeeping force - an desperately underfunded measure which has little impact in bitter civil wars other than being target practice - Rwanda, Somalia, Congo, Liberia etc? 

Even if you somehow enact a return to democracy, that means majority rule, which means a return of domination by one group over another. In the Middle East, which is so divided so deeply over so many lines, this never bodes well. 

What exactly do you do? 

5 - As if the British transition to democracy was any less bloody or violent? The start of British democracy - the Magna Carta - which wasn't exactly free and fair elections for all, was signed by King John after Barons marched in to London and held him to it with their swords. From there, we have had a hugely bloody civil war, ending with public beheading, we've had bitter domestic wars and repressions with Scotland and Ireland from the Jacobites to the IRA, our leaders have murdered thousands of their own citizens by the stake, the gallows and the firing squad. We've resisted foreign superpowers of opposed religious belief (Catholic Spanish Armada) and history remembers us as the gallant resistance because we won . Bloody massacres litter our colonial past all over the world. We are a nation who has attained our peace, stability and successful democracy through centuries of blood and guts of rebels, executioners, repressive dictators but mostly innocent bystanders.

Dude loves his wife and kid and values his family life over the stature of the club he plays at at this point in his career. I have no problem with accommodating him.

I'm not particularly pleased with our depth, but I think you overstate the degree to which it's degraded and I don't think you're being fair about VDV. We really only needed Moutinho to make everything okay, and by the sounds of things we got kind of fucked on that one so it's more a consequence of leaving it so late.

true,erowidtrance,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"1 Just look at what Netayanhu has constantly been saying about needing to attack Iran before it get nukes. Israel at the very least doesn't want a dominant apposing force in the middle east and the very fact you highlight that they're killing scientists and sending virus' shows countries aim to weaken Iran.

I'm sure it's more than just about the Hormuz because if they were concerned about keeping that open there wouldn't be this constant antagonism towards Iran, they would leave them well alone.

2 Syrian intervention is only not like Libya because of Russia and  China otherwise long ago we would have had far more direct attempts to topple Assad. Despite this the CIA is still funneling weapons, recruiting people, providing communications, armour etc so basically everything they can do to overthrow the government which is what they did in Libya: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/23/sas-troopers-help-coordinate-rebels

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/world/middleeast/cia-said-to-aid-in-steering-arms-to-syrian-rebels.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all

http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/18/us-usa-syria-wikileaks-idUSTRE73H0E720110418

3 Who is insinuating Assad is a good guy? My point is that there is violence on both sides and much of the media portray the idea that this is a simplistic good vs bad battle which is bullshit. The wests agenda has nothing to do humanity and is simply about toppling Assad I'm sure for multiple selfish reasons. 

4 Personally I would leave well alone in Syria. Many people get the impression that all these uprisings are the same when each country is different. In Egypt it looks like there was a genuine mass uprising from the bottom up that toppled Mubarak but in Syria it looks much more like certain countries are using the disenfranchised groups to push their own agenda that in the long run will not benefit the public. 

If enough of the Syrian populace want rid of Assad ultimately I'm sure he will fall like Mubarak, let the people decide their fate. 

5 Yes transition is usually violent and turbulent but the question is are the majority of the Syrians so dissatisfied with Assad that they're willing to topple him or is the media giving the general dissatisfaction more weight than it deserves whilst foreign entities facilitate civil war?

When I hear heads of state fear monger about chemical weapons i get a flashback to Iraq and considering everything else I know about Syria I get very suspicious.

true,impablomations,northumberland,Northumberland,"That 2.6 million is for people claming the disability version of Employment Support Allowance - it replaced Incapacity Benefit.  That was recently overhauled, and actually they did a fairly decent job of it.  You now have 3 versions of ESA:

1) Fit and able to work

2) Disabled but able to do some work

3) Disabled and unlikely to be able to work in the long term.

If you fall into category 2 then you are given help with training / finding jobs but they aren't too pushy with you, since suitable jobs are a lot rarer.

The big clusterfuck at the moment is their proposed changes to DLA and its tranformation into PIP.  A lot of working disabled people get DLA (at least the mobility component) as it enables them to be able to go out and work if they have a car if they would otherwise be housebound.

If they proposed points system goes through then my friend that I mentioned above - who works full time, will have to quit her job as she will lose her adapted car.  The price of her adaptation is around £5000, money she doesn't have.  Most adaptations have to be replaced every 3-4 years too.

&gt; I suspect this is an administrative cock-up or stupid but probably temporary ideological over-zealousness

The proposed points system is actually what the govt have come up with after their 2nd consultation - this is the 'improved' version!

There is a final consultation paper due in October - I'm fucking praying they lower the ridiculously high bar for the upper rate of mobility benefit or I am royally fucked and will be housebound once again.  Unable to work even if I'm fit enough.

The govts own figures show that the rate of fraud for people claiming DLA is only 0.5%

I think a big part of the rise in DLA claimants is that once you reach pensionable age - then you are allowed to keep claiming, also due to medical advances a lot of disabled children/adults are now surviving a lot longer than they used to.",0,1346728698,null,0,1346735326,0,c633y8r,t3_zany7,t1_c633y8r,t1_c630ul3,null,1429811079,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzmnPs64K74&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player

In New Who, the Doctor is not above using violence, and sometimes on a grand scale. He blows a Cyber base to hell just to send a ""message"" in the beginning of ""A Good Man Goes to War"":

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I-efBSAUiY&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player

However, I think the point is that the Doctor sees violence as a last resort. Something to be avoided. He would rather try to talk things out, use clever tricks or misdirection, or flee from a fight. But when someone or something important to him has been threatened, he can become the ""Oncoming Storm"" and use whatever means necessary.

is a massive understatement.

I've used an iTunes Season Pass for both parts of Series Six and I have one now.  Series Seven, Part 1 in HD is $13.99, SD is $8.99. This covers the five episodes before the Christmas Special.  The episodes are available for download the morning after they air on BBC/BBC America In addition, you will then have a legal digital copy you can re-watch whenever you wish. In previous seasons there was usually also some type of bonus content like a character or creature profile.

iTunes also has individual episodes for sale, but you save a dollar or two buy buying the whole season in advance, and as I mentioned you usually get some bonus video.

The whole 'we're divorced, lol JK' fiasco felt pretty cheap, and 'look at how smart I am, I can do things you can't, Doctor' would have been a huge problem for me if Oswin was human and came along with everyone, but that was wrapped up by having her not be human.

AotD is setting the stage for this season's arc, but with the last two seasons you could kinda tell what that was.  Cracks, doctor's death + silence.  The only thing hinted at this season was that memory is a big thing.  

The style of this season is said to be different from the last six, so hopefully everything gets back on the rails for the remainder of the season, but I thought AotD was kinda weak.  But you never really can be sure until the end of the season when all the seeds planted at the start finally pay off.

true,Prairie_Dog,cyberman,Cyberperson,"OK, the security system of the Asylum has to be pretty advanced. It is meant to keep in insane Daleks, and protect them from external harm. So, it is meant to allow the drop off of new inmates, but prevent the planet from being attacked.

First, the Doctor and the Ponds were unarmed and beamed down by the Daleks. This might be an established means of dropping off new inmates. The defense system might not allow the beaming in of weapons of mass destruction, but unarmed or lightly armed life forms are what it's supposed to accept. Any non-Dalek organic life form will be taken care of by the nano gene things, no need to discriminate against them.

Now, the Alaska crew. They were all in small escape pods. Again one would assume they were unarmed or lightly armed. Presumably the defense system would be programmed to accept Daleks dropped off physically in pods or other types of small landing vehicles. Non-Dalek life would also not be a concern due to the nano stuff.

A barrage of weapons of mass destruction would be exactly what the shields would be designed to exclude. The computers that control them would certainly be aware of all the Dalek forms of such weapons. Therefore, the Daleks have a conundrum. They want to used massive amounts of the type of weapons that the defenses are programmed to stop. Only solution is to turn off the defenses, only place to do that is on the planet. The nano stuff and insane Daleks are all the defenses needed down there. ",0,1346734978,null,0,false,0,c635exr,t3_zbfor,t1_c635exr,t3_zbfor,null,1429811781,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

Firstly at work, there was an argument about it it was sustainable for a single person to live healthily on a food budget of £40 per month. Being somewhat daft in the head, I not only argued it *was*, but that I'd do it.

Which I did, for five months. 

The second was the number of people I hear say they ""*cor afford to buy healthy food, 'cause it's too expensive aye it?""*.

I'm working from home this week - I'm off to Aldi in about twenty minutes, to get my weekly shop. It'll include:

* 1KG Bananas for .69
* 1KG Apples - .89 - £1.09 depending on what variety I buy.
* 1KG Clementines - .69

The list goes on. But take bananas, as that's always been the one that fascinates me, and because it's the one in the news.

Sixty nine pence for 1KG of Bananas. That have travelled half-way around the world. Granted, of course, it wasn't just that one bunch, but still - it's ridiculously cheap.

It's also completely, imo, unsustainable.

true,TragedyT,tardis,TARDIS,"Yikes, I was merely being glib - I didn't expect such a detailed answer.  I feel I owe the subject some actual thought now.

Firstly, comparing the UK licence fee to BBC International is a bit like comparing apples to ether.  Totally different things, raised totally differently, and spent in different ways too.

Anyway, the licence fee is the Beeb's main source of income - some £3.6 billion per annum, compared to £271 million raised from overseas adventures (yaar!).  

But the issue here is more than about the money - the BBC's remit is to 'provide impartial public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom, Channel Islands and Isle of Man.'  For this it receives from the government the exclusive privilege of a non-voluntary TV licence fee of £145 per year, which all TV owners in the country *must* pay. 

In this case, UK residents are unhappy that their licence fees are being used to provide exclusive content for a country that is not tied down to that involuntary licence.  The perception is that we're paying for someone else's entertainment.

I'm not sure how seriously annoyed people are here - as has been pointed out, we can all download it from Youtube with extreme ease, but I think it is more the underlying issue of the BBC taking the licence fee and making entertainment for other zones for it.  

It could even be seen as one of those 'slippery slopes' the tabloids love to get upset about.

true,spras1,uk,London,"&gt;""This isn't privatisation of the NHS""

It is. The vultures are already circling - Virgin is likely to be a big buyer of health services, and US HMOs too. In some places it is appearing that up to 49% of beds will be able to become private

&gt;""It's a way to cut through the bureaucracextract existed on the frontline of care for patients. It gives money, and gives power back to GPs. ""

That's just a Tory talking point that has little relation to the facts of the bill. GPs were dead against these reforms. The idea of handing them financial control (giving 'power back') is ridiculous. GPs have neither the time nor skills to do this. The net result will be them hiring firms (likely US HMOs) to do the accounting and management - adding a new layer of bureaucracy and the entry of privatisation.

&gt;"" It is one of the most bureaucratic and inefficient organisations in the UK""

I don't know how it stacks up against other UK firms, but as it is one of the more efficient healthcare systems in the world I think this is unlikely

&gt;""Yet as soon as anyone touches it, especially if it's a Tory, it's privatisation by the backdoor. Let's not get carried away. ""

No one is getting carried away, this is literally privatisation through the back door. The reforms were not liked by anyone involved in the sector: consumers, doctors, nurses. Yes, NHS bureaucracy has expanded massively (ironically through the part privatisation of the Labour years) and that is a problem, but all indicators point to the fact that these reforms will not solve that issue but worsen it as GPs are forced to hire external companies to manage the very 'power' they've been 'given'.

At any rate, people probably have that reaction when someone touches it becuase they usually introduce more privatisation. There has been very little 'reform' of the NHS in any other direction for many years.

So if you bother to even skim the link above you will see, under the 'any qualified provider' section:

&gt;Physicians and other employees of the NHS are primarily worried about the bill's intention to amend one of the founding pillars of the NHS to read ""any willing provider"" rather than the current language guaranteeing a needed service exclusively via the NHS and its direct affiliates and partners. Changing of the language of the NHS tenets to read ""any willing provider"" takes away that requirement and allows private sector providers to have a potentially major say inside the NHS, potentially introducing private-sector operations and pricing within the NHS and even opening up local NHS operations to the possibility of forced closure because the private industry could out-compete them and corral the NHS services into bankruptcy. The British Medical Association has said that ""Forcing commissioners of care to tender contracts to any willing provider, including ... commercial companies, could destabilise local health economies and fragment care for patients. Adding price competition into the mix could also allow large commercial companies to enter the NHS market and chase the most profitable contracts, using their size to undercut on price, which could ultimately damage local services.""[34]

I've never really seen the validity of this line of argument. who decides if things are an 'actual requirement' of practicing your religion? 

From an atheistic worldview, all religions are made up. The jedi who says he is required to wear a hooded cloak as part of his religion is as valid a claim as the Sikhs claim to a bracelet/sword. So who is to say the Sikh and/or Muslim have a greater claim to 'requirement' than a Christian who wants to wear a cross as a 'requirement' of their religion? 

After all, within all religions, including Christianity, there are many sub-groups with their own ideas and requirements. If a Christian believes it is required, how can we say they are 'making it up' in a way that Sikhs are not?

However from your dissection of my post it seems that you don't agree that the NHS need reform, or in any case the way in which Lansley has gone about it is not necessarily the best way.

I still think that it is not about privatising the NHS but about making sure patients get high-quality healthcare. From what I understand the legislation actually discriminates against private contractors in favour of the NHS. Let us not forget the amount of privatisation that took place under the previous government. We can not pin the privatisation of the NHS by the 'backdoor' on the incumbent government. Contracts to firms such as Serco were begun under the previous government.

As far as Virgin involving themselves in healthcare and its provision at a local level. I don't understand why this is necessarily going to bring about the doom of the NHS? I understand that the BMI, from your quote, believe it could ""destabilise local health economies, and fragment care"". However as long as these services are still provided free at the point of delivery, and these services ensure that patients receive the best care available surely this is excellent news for all those involved. My understanding is that in most cases Virgin are not 'competing' with local providers in separate outlets, but that they will be taking over the current local outfit.

As a report by the LSE claimed a bit of internal competition is good for the NHS. 
&gt;The study of two million patients found that if NHS hospitals are made to compete with one another, they save money and increase efficiency. Measures introduced by the last government six years ago to encourage competition between NHS hospitals led, the report concludes, to “moderate but statistically significant” reductions in patients’ length of stay in hospital. The gains in efficiency of seven to nine per cent produced what the report describes as “non-trivial savings”. Ironically, the subsequent decision – during Gordon Brown’s premiership – to allow NHS patients facing long waits to opt for private treatment did not have the same beneficial impact on efficiency.

Lansley's reforms may not be the best, but they are a starting point to reform an organisation that desperately needs it. It is extremely expensive at about 8 percent GDP, or £120bn a year. Costs have skyrocketed since 1999, doubling in real terms in the 10 years to 2009. Also productivity has fallen within the NHS over the same period, so we are spending more and getting less for our money.

From http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/einy8/why_is_there_a_gay_accent/c18ds1g:

&gt; I moved from the North east of England as a 14 year old in 1987. I have lived mostly in London and even spent a few years at school there. I still have a strong NE accent. People know where about in the country I am from. However I have spent 23 years away from the town I was brought up. My brother was 11 when we moved and he still has the same accent. Unless one is very young I don&amp;#39;t believe can change an accent.
&gt;
&gt; As an aside, my brother is gay too. He does not have the so-called gay accent.

So gay runs in the family - check.

From http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/effhx/do_depression_and_eating_disorders_go_handinhand/c17w6ln:

&gt; Yes. I have bulimia. Unlike other posts below the OP, when I am very low in my depression rather than my appetite being suppressed it is increased.
&gt;
&gt; It&amp;#39;s a horrible cycle. I am depressed. Eating junk food makes me happy. After, I feel depressed that I ate too much. So I do what I always do after over-eating and become more depressed.

So - severely mentally disturbed. Check.

For starters, people's morality is shaped by their religion as much as they are drawn to certain teachings due to confirmation-bias. A transformative religion isn't very transformative if it doesn't end up changing you.

Secondly, people should never be forced to do something they find objectionable on moral grounds. *This doesn't mean that they should keep their job*, if their job requires them to do something they can't do for moral objections too, they need to find a new job. I don't really have much sympathy for this guy, at the end of the day (although we should always look for accomodation where possible, and if flexibility in the way that rules are applied can resolve this to everyone's satisfaction then that's obviously the best resolution).

Or, an intruder can't get armed so decides not to commit the crime. An unsupportable claim I know, but it makes sense it will deter some. Currently robbers are armed, its very easy to get a knife, the people in this incident where armed (afaik going by the ""aggravated"") . Hell currently they don't even have to be armed, just be bigger than the home owner and the criminal has control of the situation. Again, your relying on the good nature of the criminal in your home. Second, you assume all criminals will just acquire firearms somehow, even in America firearms used in violent crime is at around 16% (check my post history as I researched the stat recently, on phone can't link right now). Allowing citizens to defend their homes with the best equipment available means at best the criminal will match your capability, but this is a low chance.

true,TinyZoro,null,null,"&gt;A final word of advice: Stop reading the Guardian and get in to a proper newspaper.

You pompous arse. You think the Guardian is advocating massive cuts to public sector pay? You think any newspaper is providing anything more than a mirror to its readers.
I love the way you consider simply refuting without any counter-argument or evidence my points to be making important points.
If you want to pay down debts and balance the budget you need to slash pay, benefits and unemployment, print money and increase taxes. This is unavoidable. 

All successful economies whether USA, UK, China, South Korea, Singapore, Germany were created and saved by massive public sector infrastructure projects. The private sector can not create demand in a flat economy only the state can do that.

You seem to think because I see Osborne as hopeless, useless and whose position is the result of obvious cronyism that I am a labour supporter. Tony Blair was a vapid neo-liberal too. The fact that we get to choose between a smug little circle of friends who are acceptable to the Money Markets and old rich media magnates is exactly what is broken with our political system. In a rational world with PR you could vote a party that stood for low-tax for wealth creators and we can trickle down our way out of financial Armageddon and I could vote for a party that put the Financial Elites back in their box and recreated the idea of traditional conservative high street banks. The real issue that is wrong with the economy is huge amount of total wealth now held by a tiny number of people. Social Fairness is directly correlated with economic stability. The last time we were in the same situation it created the Great Depression and the only way out was massive infrastructure projects (of which perversely war would have to be included).
&gt;pinched middle classes

Yes we are up shits creek and it is partly the middle classes fault, as it is partly everyone's fault. Therefore we are all going to feel the pain. If we dont rebuild the economy its going to get a hell of a lot worse.
&gt;increasing tax would simply make the richest in our country relocate to tax havens elsewhere.

This is such a tired argument. The very rich already do. Most of the rest have far too much at stake to just up and leave. The UK is one of the biggest economies in the world many of the richest must live here some that are prepared to leave and have no national responsibility should be welcomed to leave - it will create opportunities for those staying here. Let them be outcasts on some Caribbean island surrounded by their untaxed wealth. I would rather that than be blackmailed into allowing the richest to not carry their weight.

true,Darknezz,tennant,Tennant,"I think they've had plenty of opportunity to go that direction, and they just haven't. With Moffat writing, everything is wacky hijinks, catchphrases, and nonsense, and with Smith in the role, that's perfectly fine. And it makes sense for the character, so I can't complain much.

When Eccleston came about, the Doctor was fresh off the Time War. He committed genocide against two races, and his fresh incarnation was born from war. Thus, it makes sense that Eccleston's Doctor was a lot darker than anything since him, even during the most ridiculous plots.

Tennant's Doctor was born after Rose started healing his wounds and helping him deal with his problems. She was his new savior, and while Tennant wasn't all cheery happy fun times, he let himself loosen up a bit while he was with her.

And then Rose was ripped away from him, which he blames, at least partially, on the beings that he destroyed his own race to rid the universe of. This stabbed at his old wounds, and opened entirely new ones. Martha comes along, and he's able to put it behind him for at least a little while, and then she leaves, and the Doctor runs back into Donna.

Donna's role as a foil to the Doctor gives him a sense of balance. He loosens up more around her, and starts to let go of the things that bothered him so deeply. That's why series 5 is a little more episodic, rather than arc-focused, and why the scariest baddies from Who history don't show up until the end.

And then the Daleks rip her away from him, too. But after the bomb goes off, the Doctor thinks all the Daleks are gone, so he doesn't spend much time brooding about it. Donna gets to go back to her life, boring as it might be, and everyone else gets to live, so it's a win.

Closing Tennant's arc, Ten is forced to fight back his own race a second time, for the good of the universe. He can't bring himself to do it, though, and it takes a noble sacrifice from the Master to put an end to their catastrophe. Tennant's Doctor dies saving someone he cares deeply for, after he's put most of his past behind him.

Smith's Doctor is born out of salvation. The Doctor has been saved from his own inner turmoil, and he's reconciled his own sacrifice as necessary (which, by the way, parallels Tennant's desire to leave the role before people got sick of him, which is fantastic on RTD's part). Smith comes out fresh-faced and bright-eyed, ready to go on his happy fun adventures.

Since then, he hasn't had much of a character arc. It's been basically a flat line. He's had plenty of opportunity to develop into something darker, but hasn't, because that's not what his Doctor is about.

Lloris might give us something more in games where we want to control possession, coming out a bit further and playing in something of a sweeper role.  I know people say it's not good to chop and change keepers, but it's also not good to have one start to feel like he's a dedicated bench warmer.

The other factor is that Brad Friedel is going to be 42 soon.

true,Dirk_McAwesome,uk,Norwich/Coventry,"* The abolition of [Advance Corporation Tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_corporation_tax) (the pension thing) was started in 1993. It was doing huge damage to British businesses by encouraging them to pay out large dividends tax-free rather than reinvesting profits. Also, it distorted investment markets by making pension funds raid establishing British businesses for short-term profits. Abolishing it did cost pension funds money in the short term but in terms of longer term growth it was definitely a good and brave policy choice. [Slightly less biased article about it from the BBC.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/evandavis/2007/04/that_pensions_raid.html)

* The gold thing is firstly fairly trivial (compared to the £600bn+ budget), and secondly involves a hell of a lot of hindsight. The £9bn figure is only arrived at by comparing peak to trough. The UK actually had really disproportionate amount of gold compared to other forms of assets such as foreign currency reserves (which are actually useful since they can be used in monetary policy) because Thatcher had bought a staggering amount of gold during the [1980 peak in gold prices.](http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/12/real_gold_price.gif) The cost of that crash in value is much, much more than £9bn. Brown's gradual (over four years) reorganisation of the Treasury's asset portfolio was an entirely normal part of the job of Chancellor, not a wild, maverick trashing of established principles. Ultimately though, the very fact that gold experienced such a huge swing in prices demonstrates exactly why the government shouldn't be gambling with volatile, unproductive assets.

It's not really fair-minded to say that the Tories aren't so bad because look at New Labour, is it? That just stops us from tackling current problems - the suspicion being that that is the aim of such comments, rather than trying to construct a less-corrupt system of politics as is claimed. If it's not the aim, it certainly works to derail arguments so that you can be placated that we're not just picking on the members of your team.

Maybe Thatcher gets more blame than Brown because she spent 11 years in power, compared to his few years in power, and because she fundamentally changed British politics so that the problems of corruption that we are dealing with today, were introduced by her governments deregulation.

Secondly; this isn't like a nurse skipping gay customers. Registrars have to legally establish marriages for the state - but this individual didn't personally believe gays can be 'married'. In essence she couldn't perform her duties in good conscience - not because her 'customers' were gay, but because the act she was being asked to perform contradicted her conscience/religious views.

I would expect any self-respecting conservative to downvote you on the basis that your contributions to this conversation have yet to constitute anything remotely intelligent or coherent. You struck as me as someone who likes to believe he has a leg up over the uninformed masses. A quick read through your comment history confirmed my suspicions.

You first need to realise that making false assumptions of those who oppose you does *not* strengthen your argument. It's a common tactic employed by tabloid newspapers and biased political commentators. You lose all credibility with a statement like this.

&gt; Ah, a liberal. I can tell by the fact you're stupid, and let's face it, most liberals are stupid, hence why so many of their voters are unskilled workers and people at the lowest end of the income scale. Surprise surprise.

Granted, MrXBob's parent comment was out of line, but instead of basing your reply on the merits of your own argument, you stooped to his level and dished out a pathetic personal insult. In all your comments, you carry this dangerous mix of ignorance and confidence that really highlights how terribly misinformed you are about the state of this country. Like so many people, spanning the entire political spectrum, you appear to feed on sensationalist nonsense, read what you want to read, hear what you want to hear, and then accuse your *opponents* of being the sheep who won't open their minds. It's hypocrisy of the highest order. Liberals and conservatives alike are guilty of this, including many readers of this subreddit. You're entitled to voice any opinion you please, but don't kid yourself into thinking you're an enlightened sophisticate looking for an intellectual discussion. Your behaviour has been demonstrably pathetic.

So forgive me for not sympathising with you, but you require a serious change in attitude before entering another political discussion.

* Make 1L of Carrot &amp; Potato Soup, to be drunk through the day. I did this for most of January and February. In addition to that...

**Breakfast:**

* Porridge
* Orange Juice.

**To eat after Cardio:**

* Banana
* Handful of Blueberries.

**Mid-Morning:**

* Apple

**Lunch:**

* Cheese, Ham and Turkey sandwich, with spring onions and lettuce.
* Some of the carrot &amp; potato soup.

**Afternoon:**

* Blueberries or
* Clementine.

**Tea:**

As an approximation:

* Chicken dinner three times a week. Chicken with a few steamed potatoes, green beans and loads of carrots.

* A Jacket Potato.
* A Sandwich, similar to the one I had at lunch.
* Toasted Muffin with fillings similar to a sandwich.
* Toast [If I wasn't all that hungry]
* Cheese &amp; Ham Omelette.

**Evening Snack:**

Either an Orange or an Apple.

Would I recommend that diet to everyone? In all honesty nope. It was fine for me.

-
I'd also make shepherds pies on a fairly regular basis and eat those with loads of carrots.

**Edit: To answer your other questions:**

&gt;Did you actually make meals you were happy with or were you very conscious of the fact your meals were cheap? 

In terms of my diet - it wasn't all that different from what I was eating before. The big difference was the increase in fruit. From a budgetary pov I'd withdraw £40 at the start of each month, and carry it round with me in a little moneybag. So I was concious when shopping, but not when I'd got everything home.


&gt;Also, would you have been happy having friends round to share your meal (without telling them you're cost-cutting / lowering their expectations of what to expect)?

Yep - Everyone at work knew about it as that's where the suggestion came from. And if I went to friends houses, I'd typically take something I'd prepared, usually ""stuffed potatoes""

Basically a potato you'd use for a jacket potato, cooked for say an hour in the oven, then scooped out, the potato mixed with spring onion, cheese, ham / bacon etc, etc, then re-cooked.

I would not for one minute expect it to be prescribed for malaria, or cancer, or any other disease where we have extensive real medication to help sufferers.  But there is a huge number of people who suffer from chronic pain or other conditions for which no medical assistance can be provided.  In these cases, the NHS could do a lot worse than offer suffers (if they so wish) the option of a placebo.

It would be ideal if there was some kind of ideologically neutral vendor of placebos that could be created to fulfil this role without the need for the anti-science woo of homoeopathy, but that avoided doctors actively lying to their patients as to the expected efficacy of treatment.  But until we work out how such a system could exist, homoeopaths do have something to offer to help those who can't be helped by modern medicine.

I know that it is distasteful to legitimise such junk science with a veneer of respectability, but at the same time I think all the information is out there for people to make up their minds about homoeopathy should they choose to. I fully concede that homoeopathy offers no benefits over placebos, people often forget quite how astonishingly effective the placebo effect can be, especially when administered with the kind of in depth consultation that is typical of homoeopathic treatment.  And where people complain that public money should not be spent on treatments that are not shown to be better than a placebo, at least it is not as awful as the number of GPs who are willing to hand out huge amounts of antibiotics to troublesome patients just to get them to shut up and go away, costing money, reducing the overall effectiveness of the drugs for others and reinforcing peoples belief that they can just ask for pills no matter what condition they have.

well fair point, and we don't know all the ins-and-outs and such. I personally think the employee should simply have left; but as I said above I think/thought the employer does/should have a duty to try and accomodate their employees beliefs as far as is possible.

I disagree that this case is comparable to that. If a vicar who believes the bible describes homosexuality as sinful is asked to perform a gay wedding, he cannot do it in good conscience. He doesn't believe it's a marriage, the words he says would be a sham, he would be making himself a hypocrite. It would be like if he was asked to share a platform with Tony Blair but he believed Blair should be arrested for war crimes.  

A nurse or bus driver has no such issue, because they aren't asked to publicly declare an endorsement of their clients behaviour or lifestyle. 

And there is no central authority within christianity that says what's right or wrong. everyone is entitled to their own opinions and what is right or wrong according to their conscience and beliefs.

Sure, if the government had hung onto a big pile of gold for another ten years and then been lucky enough to sell at the very peak (gold prices are tailing off now) then they would have made around £9bn more than they did. This would have been an incredibly risky and irresponsible thing to have done, especially given the productive uses to which the money tied up in gold could have gone to.

I'm sorry, but I have to disagree with you on this. While I myself am an atheist, and I can presume you are too, a huge number of people (especially the elderly) are NOT atheist.

 Now when these views are especially relevant *to them* as they near death, it is not unreasonable to assume that they would want to reaffirm their faith, or be comforted in their pain. Now, psychological condition has an almost tautological effect on physical condition/pain reception. As a result, while technically it is not a medicinal way of easing passing/ helping recovery it is a hell of a lot cheaper (and ethical) to hire chaplains (that many people other than patients, such as grieving relatives, appreicate having around) than to pay for a machine to keep an elderly person alive for months on end. 


And this also applies almost directly to homeopathy too. Homeopathy provides cheap (on the NHS, not privatised Homeopathy, distinct difference) comfort which can aid recovery on certain patients, using the tried and tested placebo effect. IN ADDITION it can stop people with very minor ailments from clogging up hospital beds, after having visited a GP, Not being given any medicine, decided it was a poor decision on behalf of the GP and gone to A&amp;E. However, if the person is given a placebo, they will feel like something has been done to help them, and perhaps it really will help them. 

As a result, we have a cheap method to keep hospital beds for those who really need them, potentially saving lives, as well as keeping people from being ignored, and curing minor pain.

Personally I don't agree with this. I believe that when money has been accepted the ""offer"" made by the customer has been accepted. And you can't revoke an acceptance - you can only revoke offers.

I went to see a homeopath a few years ago when I had an eye problem and had already exhausted all the conventional methods to no avail. Basically, you sit with the homeopath for a good hour or two and they talk about your history (not just medical but personal and emotional history too) to get a good understanding of your personality and how you react to different things. Rather than try to treat the symptom, they look at the body (and mind) as a whole and find where there might be an imbalance. For example, the homeopath asked a lot of questions about any previous back or spinal problems I'd had where opthamologists focused very much on the eye.

I was actually urged to see a chiropractor by the homeopath and was given nutritional advice. I was also offered a pill, yes, which did nothing for me. So there you go.",0,1346764386,null,0,false,0,c6397ke,t3_zbwgh,t1_c6397ke,t1_c638s4l,null,1429813735,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

[Further reading in an article by Terry Sanderson](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jan/17/acrosstobear?INTCMP=SRCH).

&gt; ""...in one instance she made an accusation against BA's Christian Fellowship group that turned out to be completely fallacious, and the tribunal felt compelled to say: ""We find it demonstrates to a degree the extent to which the claimant [Eweida] misinterpreted events, as well as her readiness to make a serious accusation without thought of the implications.""""

Chaplin is much simpler: The NHS has a policy against most items of jewelry including necklaces and for very obvious and sensible reasons. They can get caught on things when nurses are bending over, they can be grabbed by patients and they can harbour germs. [Here's a local trust's reasoning (search for necklace).](http://www.icid.salisbury.nhs.uk/ClinicalManagement/OperationalIssues/Pages/BarebelowelbowUniformPolicies.aspx) I think Chaplin was offered the option of wearing a cross broach but decided that that wouldn't do at all. I really don't understand how she got as far as she did (35 years as a nurse), considering how long the policy had been in place before she got a wrist slap.

In any case, and something that needs to be made clear time and again, even to the fecking Prime Minster: There is no law saying (or the equivalent) ""Christians cannot wear a cross at work."" Employers get to make their own (reasonable) rules and all these cases are simply a massive misdirection to give the impression Christianity is under attack. Hence all the lies, all the time.

Wow, that is pretty low, given that the BBC probably gets money for DVD purchases of Fawlty Towers, Monty Python's Flying Circus, Sherlock, Doctor Who, etc....

Still, I can see why you guys would be so annoyed.  But isn't it mostly British entertainment anyway?  Doctor Who has always been a primarily British property and, as the ""overseas adventures"" demonstrate, it doesn't make that much money from the Americans in the first place (maybe?  Now I have to wonder how NBC and company are doing based off of Community and Firefly and such...).  That being said, the Beeb may also be wondering if it will be cut off at some point and is trying to prepare itself to get axed.  If I recall correctly, America has something similar in PBS and its radio cousin NPR, except they're funded by the tax pot, not a certain tax, and they derive most of their funding from non-federal government sources, so even a complete budget cut wouldn't kill them whereas the BBC would be effectively killed by losing the license fee.  That may explain the push to get more from the overseas market...although turning iPlayer into a subscription service could recoup some of the loss from a lost license fee.

true,spras1,uk,London,"""that you don't agree that the NHS need reform""

No, I specifically said I do think it does. My point was that these 'reforms' will make the problem (bureaucracy) worse. They are not a solution

"" From what I understand the legislation actually discriminates against private contractors in favour of the NHS""

It has the potential to do exactly the opposite. It says that in the paragraph I quoted for you.

&gt; Let us not forget the amount of privatisation that took place under the previous government

This is true, I stated this. Labour used PFI schemes, originally thought up by Thatcher/Major. They won an election with a manifesto against these schemes. Then they used them. This was a major instance of privatisation by the back door. It is widely unpopular, and a complete disaster for all involved (apart from their rich mates)

&gt;We can not pin the privatisation of the NHS by the 'backdoor' on the incumbent government

They have drastically furthered the process, to the point that this is not just a bit of private intervention in what is essentially a public service (what PFI was) but can (and will) constitute a wholescale restructure that will be next to impossible to roll back as key services come under proper private ownership (whereas with PFI they were publicly owned, the hospitals just owed enormous sums to the private sector which has massively impacted patient care in areas where they have been used.

&gt;My understanding is that in most cases Virgin are not 'competing' with local providers in separate outlets, but that they will be taking over the current local outfit.

Absolutely, even you seem to now suggest this biases private providers over the NHS.

&gt;It is extremely expensive at about 8 percent GDP, or £120bn a year.

This is not 'extremely expensive'. US healthcare, for instance, is more like 12% of GDP per year. A bit of competition goes a long way...to driving up healthcare costs

&gt; Costs have skyrocketed since 1999, doubling in real terms in the 10 years to 2009. Also productivity has fallen within the NHS over the same period, so we are spending more and getting less for our money. 

Absolutely, funnily enough this is the period of privatisation of one form or another. The amount of managers has grown hugely compared to staff numbers during this period.

Lansleys reforms extend and deepen the reforms already brought in by the privatisation of the previous government. They will exacerbate the very problems you identify. It is the absolute opposite of what the NHS needs. At any rate, for some reason you claimed this was not privatisation by the back door. Maybe you would dispute that actually it's via the front door, but even you in your post identify the entry of privatisation in to the service.

Lansley made a giant deal of 'handing control to GPs'. As I stated above, GPs were dead against this for the reasons I have spoken of: they will have to essentially hand that control to private firms anyway (mostly the US HMOs that have been funding Lansleys office through his years in the shadow cabinet), and thus a whole new layer of bureaucracy and petty managers will be introduced. This is not what the NHS needs. 

Healthcare should be for need, not for profit. 

And if anyone remains in any doubt, some top Tories have literally called for the end of the NHS: http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/3-top-tories-call-for-nhs-413096.

This is pretty much the issue some doctors (well strictly the STC and BMC) have mentioned on the issue with national policies of prescription of placebos.  It shouldn't be done on a national level and ideally on an individual level but on discretion (and the Damoclesian GMC) of the individual doctor.

  Interestingly placebos CAN work even if the patient is told it is a placebo [[1]](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0015591).  Another interesting aspect is placebos are not without side-effects (so-called ""nocebo"" effects [[2]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15301298) [[3]](http://www.painjournalonline.com/article/S0304-3959\(09\)00399-6/abstract)), even homeopathy [[4]](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1475491603000079).  

The argument for keep the patient within the system is a good one (even if it relies on ethical referring of patients which homeopaths haven't exactly got a spotless record of so far [[5]](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/5178122.stm)) but as pointed out medical doctors individually already use placebos when needed (burn victims and opiate placebos for example) without having to support and validate an alternative medicine industry overseen and administered by individuals that are palpably not medical doctors.

As an example, despite overwhelming public support for the BBC and widespread public condemnation of News International's corruption at every level, our government did everything it could to push through the News Int. buy out of BSkyB, while simultaneously deciding to keep the BBc licence fee currently frozen for the longest period they could - until the next charter review in 2016.  We can expect a lot more cuts like *Confidential* getting axed.

However, last summer, he gave his real reasoning. It's the same reasoning all the newer actors playing the Doctor seem to have come across. The senior staff.

According to Bad Wilf , which has a transcript of the session, Eccleston said he left the show [""because I could not get along with the senior people"", ""I left because of politics.

I'm not going around bad mouthing the guy as it's too early to judge him as a Spurs manager. But I'm not throwing my support behind him either.

I didn't think he was the best choice available when it came time to replace Redknapp. I also didn't think it was necessary to replace Redknapp in the 1st place.

I also didn't like the way things were going at Chelsea when he was in charge there (I mean I did like it, because it meant they were loosing, but you know what I mean!). 

I know everyone at /r/COYS is sticking adamantly to the belief that the manager/player acrimony at Chelsea was all down to the players, as by nature all Chelsea players must be c*nts. But I don't believe that's the whole truth of it. Especially when I see Spurs players like Tom Huddlestone (who I believe is a stand up guy) tweeting that respect needs to be earned not demanded in relation to AVB. 

I also believe that its likely that there was some truth in the rumor that the Spurs players didn't want him here as they'd heard from their friends at Chelsea that he's a nightmare to work with.

Time will tell as to weather he'll be ok in the Spurs dressing room. And it is too early to start calling for his head. But so far I've seen little to change my opinion of him. Especially his extremely questionable substations during the Norwich match.

As regards to tinkering with the squad. That's what the off season is for. I know there are a couple of late editions, but tinker away during training. Know what you're doing during the match. That's management 101.

Home invasions are almost always carried out unarmed in the UK.  More to the point the police only shoot 2 people on average  a year, compare that to the US. Essentially the 'freedom' to carry a firearm makes state intrusion and use of force massively more likely (there were massively more armed, no-knock raids in the US last year than there were armed crimes in the UK, even when you take into account differences in population..). 

&gt;If the home invader is bigger, harder, better fighter, with others , armed then the law abiding citizen is fucked. At best the criminal gives you mercy or decides to run.

And they will run, why? Because crimes against people are heavily punished, investigations are better funded and manned and so on.  A home invasion, just breaking in to someones house is serious, but not that serious, attacking people in the house and you have a massive problem and are facing serious jail time.  What would you rather do, leave, or take a chance with a long prison spell..

&gt;By being armed, and trained how to use it, you are now at the top. Despite what people say not all criminals will have guns (even if they did, less training and offensive disadvantage). 

If firearms became more available, criminals would be massively more likely to carry them, the police would have to start carrying them and they would get used in crimes massively more often.  At that point anyone who breaks into your house, or trespasses, or knocks on the door is a potential threat, that isn't the case right now (and I'd rather it didn't become the case.).  As to training, burglars are people too, I'm sure they'd go out and learn to use firearms effectively, it isn't exactly that hard (I'm ex-Army..).

&gt;The large majority of the time you will have the advantage, a complete roll reversal from our current system. A minority of the time and worst case scenario is you are equal, our current best case scenario!

&gt;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/7922755/England-has-worse-crime-rate-than-the-US-says-Civitas-study.html

How do you compare crime rate? Is a report of anti-social behaviour the same as a report of theft or robbery? Is a robbery the same as a murder? Sure, the UK sees a higher level of property crime, especially vehicle crime when compared to the US, but the murder rate is massively lower and the prison population a fraction of that of the US..  I'd also point out that crime has been going down for quite a while in the UK whilst the perception of crime has been that it is getting worse.. people tend to think there is more and worse crime occurring just outside of their local areas.

&gt;Source? I'm finding it very hard to find stats on burglaries in the UK.

As for homeopathy saving money, well there is no evidence for that so we can agree to differ on that point. 

Either way is it ethical for a doctor to lie to a patient and give them a falsehood even if it does make them better? Are they any better prepared for life thinking a sugar pill will save them. I would say not and I would not trust a doctor that lied to me.

Which would mean arming the police and there would be far more firearms available on the ground, they would also be the target for theft (at least initially, as a firearm is pretty valuable to criminals in an environment where they are scarce).

It would also mean arming the police, if you can't expect home owners to be unarmed in their homes, you can't expect the police to be unarmed if you increase the number of people armed.

All you are doing, is increasing the use and prevalence of firearms, there are already close to a million firearms (legal ones..) in the UK.

The law in the UK is already that you can use a proportional amount of force, I assume you wouldn't change that (or do you think shooting a burglar because they might be a threat is OK?), if you didn't then the use of firearms against an unarmed burglar should in many cases result in a prosecution of the person who decided to use the firearm, or you would end up with a similar situation in parts of the US where you can shoot when threatened (applying that to the police would then also result if far more shootings..).

Essentially, I can't see a sensible way of bringing this in without making the situation in the UK worse.  Guns aren't a panacea for violent crime, nothing is but your suggestions would certainly raise the stakes for everyone and make everyone a little bit less safe.

Like someone else said, it is not appropriate to shoot someone who is stealing your  TV and making it more likely that the person who might want to steal your TV is armed (or gets shot..) doesn't seem sensible.

true,ajehals,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;our logic of not wanting to shoot somebody for a TV is true, but totally impractical. Somebody has forced themselves into the place that's meant to be the safest environment for somebody. In the most scared moment of somebody's life, the idea that we expect them to assume or guess the intend of the intruder/intruders is not acceptable to me. 

So you think it's OK to shoot someone who breaks into your house, regardless of how much of a threat they pose? That's fucking idiotic.  Like I said, I'm ex-Army and we couldn't shoot people just for the hell of it even if they broke in, we couldn't shoot at people who were shooting at us if it posed a risk to others, we couldn't keep shooting at them if they dumped their weapons, but you think shooting someone who is in your house is fine? 

&gt;You don't know that robbers intend until they either run or start killing you.

Walking down the street must be frightening for you.  You don't know what people are going to do most of the time, anyone could be a threat, but currently, most people who break into your house aren't a threat...

&gt;I don't think the law is enough. The robber has posed a direct threat, the law is on my side, great! Now what? Oh I'm fucked, here comes a barbaric knife or fist fight

Or at present, they try to get away.. That seems like a good outcome.

&gt;You might not see a problem, but the tens if not hundreds of thousands of burglaries that happen next year, I hope the occupants are Lucky or the burglars show mercy.

As those statistics I pointed out show, burglaries are normally not violent, you are far more likely to face a violent crime (and indeed an armed in some way crime) outside of your home than in it.

So what it actually does is teleport the user to a facility where they can be studied to find out what went wrong. And when Metaltron showed up there, he was not happy to find himself surrounded by Daleks regarding him as an unfortunate mutation to be studied and disposed of...

Firstly, you seem to think that you need a firearm to protect you from burglars and trespassers, that simply doesn't fit with the crime trends, so you have to be pretty scared to think that a firearm is needed for home defence.

As to your defensive needs being met when an intruder flees, I disagree, your defensive need is never there if they don't pose a risk.  Bear in mind that most people don't pose a risk in the first place, but you massively raise the stakes if you threaten an intruder with a firearm.

&gt; If they don't decide to flee you have the option to defend yourself, and again this is empowering criminals, they are controlling the situation.

Would you simply shoot someone who entered your house? If not, what criteria would you apply to whether you shoot or not? Do you not think that if firearms were more available and if burglars were more likely to face an armed home owner that they are more likely to invest in a firearm? 

&gt;Outside of home is a completely different problem. Multiple problems don't negate or cancel each other out, they aren't mutually exclusive, we have lots of problems.

We are seeing a continuous reduction in violent crime, what evidence is there to support your argument that firearms wouldn't reverse that trend? When more firearms were available, crime was higher, when there were less restrictions on the use of force (for the police amongst others) more force was used.

No it's not.  Not by a long shot.  

It's unethical for doctors to issue placebos when they need another form of medicine.  If you've got a hypochondriac or somebody with a psychological addiction why not treat with a clinically verifiable phenomenon?  It can produce quantifiable results:

http://www.nhs.uk/news/2009/10October/Pages/Placebo-effect-starts-in-the-spine.aspx

If someone's undergoing some form of treatment and they're of a nervous disposition which is causing them genuine distress although there's no identifiable physical cause, give them a placebo on top of their meds.  Treat the patient as well as the physical condition.

For all the ridiculousness of it  send every NHS doctor a free certificate and make them grand wizards in homoeopathy to boot.  Somebody wants to try homeopathy?  

         ""Fine - we have to carry on with the conventional medicine 
          at the same time but you get free homeopathy medicines 
          and they're stronger than what you can get over the 
          counter.  Let me just go into the back room and get some 
          of the good stuff with the extra voodoo missing in it.""

We do the same thing with kids all the time.  It's called the Tooth Fairy.

true,dwair,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"A very, very  tragic event badly reported by the BBC.

Unfortunately if you don't spend a lot of time near the sea, it can be very difficult to quantify the risk of something as simple as going for a swim.  Personally I think the RNLI do a fantastic job in the season but its perhaps a little unrealistic to think that all year round cover would be appropriate.  

I surf at Northcott and more than a few times during September had the entire beach to myself for hours on end.  It is perfectly reasonable for lifeguard cover to be withdrawn from some beaches at the end of the summer season. There just isn’t the quantity of people around to justify the cover out of season.  If you want a ""safer"" beach all you have to do is look around a bit. There are a few beaches on the North coast that have weekend cover / full cover extended up until October. 

As a slight aside, shit can still happen.  My ex wife was swimming with my 11 year old daughter at Widemouth (just down the road from Northcott)  last Friday afternoon and they were helped by the beach lifeguards when they got caught in a rip.  Both swim extremely well and know the dangers of swimming on a long sandy beach with an out going tide.  They still got caught out and were more than happy to be assisted back to shore rather than having to swim the long way round.  Knowing that the Widmouth has a couple of very strong rips was the primary reason they were both in the water on a part of the beach that was being patrolled.

true,PikaBlue,null,null,"From the trials I've read about acupuncture the results tend to either be heavily biased (the acupuncturists opinion, how the person 'feels' straight afterwards, etc.) or very improperly done (the patient may be receiving treatment elsewhere, etc.). Most, if not all results that people receive tend to be purely placebo. Not saying placebo doesn't work in itself (a placebo effect can last around 3 months and even works if the patient is TOLD it's a placebo, a sort of double bluff) but it would be just as effective as any other placebo care that a person believed in strongly enough. Placebo's have truly amazing effects, but they generally can't sort non-neurological issues.

There was a trial a while back I was reading where they conducted a test with acupuncture needles and pressure devices that felt like the needles and stuck to the body through an adhesive. Both came back with the same results.

Brilliant book to try, 'Trick or treatment.' Cites its sources and has amazing info.

Things like Witchazel, Evening Primrose, Echinacea, St John's Wart etc actually have active ingredients that have measurable effect. The thing is though that the active chemicals found aren't in enough quantity to warrant distilling, or maybe only work in tandem with each other. Hell, St John's Wart needs a full warning label in my opinion.

true,gazzthompson,eng-norfolk,Norfolk,"&gt;Firstly, you seem to think that you need a firearm to protect you from burglars and trespassers, that simply doesn't fit with the crime trends, so you have to be pretty scared to think that a firearm is needed for home defence.

Any normal sized, untrained citizen will need some sort of equipment to increase their chances of a confrontation with a criminal. That's just common sense, Not everyone is trained in martial arts. In pretty much every single scenario the criminal has the advantage. Hes bigger than you? fucked. Better fighter? fucked. More of them? fucked. Kitchen knife? fucked. Bat? fucked. Hes unarmed, smaller and worst fighter than you plus being alone? great!

&gt;so you have to be pretty scared to think that a firearm is needed for home defence.

Or just have a realistic sense of reality. 

&gt;As to your defensive needs being met when an intruder flees, I disagree, your defensive need is never there if they don't pose a risk. Bear in mind that most people don't pose a risk in the first place, but you massively raise the stakes if you threaten an intruder with a firearm.

Your first part is just fantasy land thinking, there is a criminal intruder in your home with unknown intent! How can that not be a risk??! I'm amazed you say this... If you cant accept this we have a massive fundamental disagreement here and this debate is pointless. 

&gt; but you massively raise the stakes if you threaten an intruder with a firearm.

Logic behind this?

&gt;Would you simply shoot someone who entered your house? If not, what criteria would you apply to whether you shoot or not? Do you not think that if firearms were more available and if burglars were more likely to face an armed home owner that they are more likely to invest in a firearm?

No I would not. And the same logic we have now, except this time people can actually defend themselves rather than a government sponsored fist and knife fight. 

&gt;Do you not think that if firearms were more available and if burglars were more likely to face an armed home owner that they are more likely to invest in a firearm?

Legal firearm owners rarely if ever commit these sorts of crimes, these are done by criminals with criminal records who cant legal invest in a firearm.

&gt;We are seeing a continuous reduction in violent crime, what evidence is there to support your argument that firearms wouldn't reverse that trend?

As previously mentioned, There seems to be no link between legal firearm ownership and crime. Hell a study was done back when the pistol ban came in:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1440764.stm

&gt;But the report suggests that despite the restrictions on ownership the use of handguns in crime is rising.

The Centre for Defence Studies at Kings College in London, which carried out the research, said the number of crimes in which a handgun was reported increased from 2,648 in 1997/98 to 3,685 in 1999/2000.
It also said there was no link between high levels of gun crime and areas where there were still high levels of lawful gun possession.
Of the 20 police areas with the lowest number of legally held firearms, 10 had an above average level of gun crime.
And of the 20 police areas with the highest levels of legally held guns only two had armed crime levels above the average. 

Both that study , and the current trend of increased firearm ownership and reduction of firearm crime seem to conclude there is no relationship between the two. 

&gt;but would result instead in an arms race.

There already is an arms race, And all the criminal needs to do is get a knife out of his kitchen or simply be larger and better fighter and he's won. Great!",0,1346776242,null,0,false,0,c63bwa1,t3_zapom,t1_c63bwa1,t1_c63b8f2,null,1429815014,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Additionally, every single 'lost' episode has surviving audio and photos/stills/clips/etc. A company called ""loose cannon"" used this recovered audio and things to make reconstructions like this: [Marco Polo Reconstruction Clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozijqWPwY5A#t=7m1s).

true,ajehals,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;We have had 2 Amendments to the firearms act AFAIK recently. These happened in 1988 and 1997

We have had modifications to the rules on firearm ownership (and the classification of firearms) on a moderately regular basis.  The most recent restriction was the banning of most handguns.  There have also been restrictions on imitation firearms, airsoft weapons and replicas.

&gt;I know many other shooters, Don't know a single one who stores them in armouries.

So therefore it doesn't happen? When I was in the Army, all personally owned firearms (and there were a lot of sports shooters...) stored their weapons in the armoury, every club I have been to in the last few years (south Yorkshire, Hampshire) has had an armoury for members guns and ammunition, it is a hell of a lot cheaper to store weapons at your shooting club than it is to have a cabinet installed at home given the regulations.

&gt;More likely reason for this is there is no real link between legal firearm ownership of our type and gun crime.

There is a significant link between the availability of firearms and gun crime.  If you regulate firearm ownership heavily, it doesn't really matter if you have 1 gun or 10,000,000 guns owned by people, it will still be hard for people to obtain them illegally.  If you start letting people buy them for home defence then the need becomes greater for criminals, more firearms are available to steal at home and more people will obtain firearms.  

There is no evidence at all to suggest that more firearms available to the public reduces gun crime..",0,1346776427,null,0,false,0,c63by28,t3_zapom,t1_c63by28,t1_c63bqxu,null,1429815039,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,ajehals,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;Any normal sized, untrained citizen will need some sort of equipment to increase their chances of a confrontation with a criminal. That's just common sense, Not everyone is trained in martial arts. In pretty much every single scenario the criminal has the advantage. Hes bigger than you? fucked. Better fighter? fucked. More of them? fucked. Kitchen knife? fucked. Bat? fucked. Hes unarmed, smaller and worst fighter than you plus being alone? great!

Why would you assume that a confrontation with a criminal requires a violent response?  And since you do, why would you think it would all be better if everyone were armed?

&gt;Or just have a realistic sense of reality.

No, really.  3000 armed incidents in the last year, 2 police shootings, a generally unarmed police force, that is the reality.  You seem to think it would be better if there were more people armed and getting shot.. It's a paranoid fantasy.

&gt;Your first part is just fantasy land thinking, there is a criminal intruder in your home with unknown intent! How can that not be a risk??! 

Shoot first! Ask questions later! for all our safety! Yeah, that seems sensible.  You are not at risk unless you are actually at risk, you don't get to shoot people because you are scared, you don't get to knife people because you are scared either.  Unknown intent doesn't equate to an immediate risk to your life, unless you happen to live in a fantasy world where all criminals are actually murderous villains who need shooting.

&gt;Logic behind this?

When you introduce a firearm into any situation, you increase the stakes.  You increase them further when you make ready...  Someone is more likely to die.

&gt;The Centre for Defence Studies at Kings College in London, which carried out the research, said the number of crimes in which a handgun was reported increased from 2,648 in 1997/98 to 3,685 in 1999/2000. It also said there was no link between high levels of gun crime and areas where there were still high levels of lawful gun possession. Of the 20 police areas with the lowest number of legally held firearms, 10 had an above average level of gun crime. And of the 20 police areas with the highest levels of legally held guns only two had armed crime levels above the average.

In a period where owning a handgun became illegal? This is where the availability thing comes in.  What do you think happens to firearms that suddenly cease to be legal to own? Do you think some proportion of those weapons are still kept illegally (which is a crime involving a handgun..) or even sold?

&gt;There already is an arms race, And all the criminal needs to do is get a knife out of his kitchen or simply be larger and better fighter and he's won. Great!

Personally I don't trust any news source.  They all lie or bend the truth.

I tend to read something that interested me on places like this, then read the comments.  You can get a good idea of what's happening.  The key is never to have a gut reaction to a story, if you feel strongly about it, then there's a good chance someone is manipulating you.  Read, then stand back and think about what's been reported.

But there are sources you can never trust:  Daily Mail / Sun / Mirror / Star

And you can't see, as someone who is presumably licensed to hold a firearm, and trained to use one, why adding a firearm into the mix would be a negative not a positive?  Have you actually ever had to point a gun at someone? Been shot at? Stood somewhere where you were the likely target of someone with a firearm? The instinct, regardless of how well you are trained is to fire when threatened, it takes quite a lot to overcome that... Now put someone with a few hours (over a few weeks..) of firearms training into a dark room with a gun and an intruder and tell me how many criminals and homeowners will end up dead or injured (to say nothing of accidents and suicides).

&gt;And what about all the unarmed incidents? criminals don't need to be armed to beat somebody to a pulp or kill them.

And yet the murder rate is low in the UK.. Oh and of course most criminals aren't violent.. Again, increasing the chances of one or both parties being armed is a bad idea.

&gt;I'm not saying shoot first and ask questions later. At all.

You are saying that a criminal presence is a threat and that people should react to that, you are saying that people should be armed in their homes if you want, that will lead to more people shooting intruders on principle..

&gt;I'm not saying that.

Yeah, you are.

&gt;And the current is better? Where people are at the mercy and will of the friendly guy who broke into their house? Arm the law abiding citizens home.

Yes, because currently it is vanishingly unlikely that either party will be armed, it is incredibly unlikely that either party will end up dead and it is unlikely that anyone involved will be seriously hurt.  You are more likely to be the victim of violence on a Friday or Saturday night out on the town, and I'm sure you don't want people to start carrying guns when they are out and about.

&gt;Yes, but as ive said before, its not just about guns! That's the main problem with this debate. 

It is about guns though, guns are the main, really big important bit...

&gt;Gun control is not actually simply about guns... People can easily kill you with their fist or knife.

Yes, but they can far more easily kill you with a gun.  And the less guns there are that are not being properly controlled the fewer such incidents there are.  Its not just about guns, but guns are pretty much the main issue... Making sure they are controlled is really important, making them more available for people to use in a lethal manner against other people is idiotic and counter productive.

I found it hard to work out what you meant from the garbled text you posted. Now I get what you mean. You should write all the words in a sentence more, then people can understand what you're saying.

I don't see all politicians ""as devious masterminding cunts rather than little shits"" - I think that you shouldn't trust people in power, as they will abuse power if you do. I'm fine with people other than myself running society, I just think they should do so for the benefit of society. 

I also have no feeling that politicians having dominion over myself, you've come up with that from your own odd psyche. Maybe you should question yourself and see if you're feeling pathetic about politicians having dominion over you?

I don't understand why you think I see the world in black and white, either. Maybe someone accused you of that and you thought you'd try it on me, to try and intimidate me.

Gordon Brown wanting to be remembered as a great man doesn't mean that he wouldn't use PR or abuse power to achieve that. Of course he wanted to be remembered as a great person - which politician doesn't? 

So, you weren't supporting him specifically, you were just aggressively pointing out that he was vain in the way that all politicians are vain.

My central point is still that governments should not be gambling public money on commodities markets.

I feel I owe you a little more explanation on the ""announcing the sale beforehand"" thing, since it is intuitively a very bad thing. Here's the way I see the chain of events:

* Government announces sale
* Markets anticipate prices during the sale, given their knowledge of market supply and demand
* Prices drop to the expected sale price level (with corrections for inflation/future discounting/motivated buyers/etc.)
* When the sale rolls around, gold is sold at the sale price level.

The crucial thing here is that while prices drop before the auction, they only drop to the expected sale level. Even if this expected sale level is wrong, the sale price is the same and the only reason for the drop was the expectation.

I guess there's the idea that if the government could sell gold while concealing the quantity it was selling then it could gain a higher price for the first gold it sold, but then the last gold sold would go at a lower price. The mean price for the whole load of gold would be the same.

The issues are not as clear cut as you think and generally not as you'll read in the Telegraph. This is the most balanced article I've ever seen in there, though.

Chaplin, the nurse: the NHS has a strict jewellry policy that's been in place for years.

Eweida, the BA lady: She wore it under her uniform (for years I believe), then wanted to wear it on top specifically so (paraphrased) ""People can see that Jesus loves them"". BA said no, she then won against them (not just because of the cross) and they apologised, changed their policy and offered her money. She said no and took them to a tribunal. She lost and the tribunal said (among other things) that she was a ""nightmare employee"".

This has never been about persecuting people or employers being annoyed or not liking that their staff are religious. This has been about abiding by the rules your employer sets, for whatever reason. Sometimes those rules might be silly and in those cases the rules can be changed (Eweida) but religious discrimination, specifically against Christians, is not taking place and never was. The NHS policy is common sense, for example. Plus Chaplin was offered the choice of wearing a cross on her ID.

&gt; Ms Chaplin told The Daily Telegraph that she felt “insulted” by the argument that Christians who are told by their employer that they cannot wear a cross at work can always find another job.

A superficial reading implies that Chaplin was *not* allowed to wear a cross. Not so, at all, and this sort of dishonest language has been used on purpose for years.

The courts in this country have found against all these persecution cases and for good reason.

true,LyttonDays,null,null,"&gt;You're right. You were arguing that it's ethical to lie about whether it works. 

Still wrong.

I was arguing whether it was ethical to allow a patient who believes in homeopathy, even when they're told it is not backed by science, to be allowed it if they still, knowing that the doctor himself doesn't believe in it, the doctor knowing full well that any results will be purely in line with a placebo effect, which can been quantified.  If they understand the doctor doesn't throw any weight behind it but they still believe in it to the contrary then give them the damn glass of water and sit back and watch the placebo effect.  I was also arguing that placebos are not unethical, which I attested with links of doctors using placebos - and not just in controlled studies either.

&gt;Which is a complete about turn...  

Again, no it is not.

You tell a stupid person that this is stupid  but they find it extraordinary; they might believe in fairies, crystals and hugging trees too.  They're told there's nothing scientific about it but they still believe in it - that's pretty damn well much a belief in the extraordinary. 

It's a simple concept.  It really, really is.  

- Placebos are already used in medicine.  You've got a link for that.    
- There is a quantifiable placebo effect.    
- You tell a person it's nothing to do with science but if they find comfort in it, you give them some magical 'Aqua of Gaia' in addition to their conventional treatment, at next to no cost, and they are comforted.

That's the third time in saying it.  The reading comprehension here is terrible.

&gt;You need not look further than the GMC's Good Medical Practice to find out how it's unethical and not allowed. 

Let's see what they say on it, shall we?

&gt;Mention placebos to the General Medical Council, the doctors' disciplinary body, and the response is somewhat muted. Several times in the past year, I and others have asked the GMC to clarify its stance on both homeopathy and the placebo effect, and in each case I've been referred back to the same guidance, which reads as follows, but could be interpreted in many ways depending on your definition of ""benefits"":

              ""We do not require doctors to use only evidence-based
              treatments, in any form of medical care, but we do 
              expect doctors to do their best to ensure that any 
              treatment they offer is in the patient's best interests. 
              This will generally mean that any known risks of the 
              treatment are outweighed by the potential benefits 
              to the patient.""

http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/jul/05/homeopathy-doctors-placebos

NHS doctors, along with German and US doctors, are allowed to use placebos.  Some doctors consider it a breach of trust if they don't tell the patient (although the placebo effect can still be observed even when the patient knows), others don't and consider that it can be good practice, but it most definitely is allowed if done properly.

In Germany half of all doctors admit to using placebos as part of providing the best care:

Of course, but the drug research is then required to be checked for safety etc by agencies such as the FDA in the US and the MHRA in the UK.

And poorly planned or executed drug trials will not be considered as good enough evidence for licensing a drug. The regulations surrounding evidence for licensing a drug are quite strict due to the case of thalidomide. The US probably didn't change much seeing as they didn't license thalidomide, but over here, it caused a lot of trouble and in response drug licensing got stricter.

Besides that, in the UK after the MHRA has checked the safety etc. It won't be available on prescription unless NICE has checked its cost-effectiveness. And if a placebo works just as well, it won't be made available.

Plus there's not much point in hiding bad drug results in the UK. The NHS can be one massive clinical trial. In phase 2 and phase 3 they have to use patients, and if they use UK patients, the NHS is definitely involved. Bad results are going to come out in the end.

It's interesting to check what you've mentioned and the article is based on a meta-analysis carried out by Dr. Irving Kirsch. But when they say anti-depressants I'm not sure which drug types they were specifically checking. I'm guessing it's TCAs which people try not to prescribe as much over here due to side-effects.

I was not aware how different the systems were between the US and the UK and I think mostly the cost effectiveness affects the points I was trying to make.

In the US the pharmaceutical industry seems to be a lot more capitalist than efficient. By which I mean drug reps go to doctors and doctors seem to have certain drugs they prescribe more often than other similar drugs. I believe this is more relevant to psychiatry because it is near impossible to determine which drug/drugs will be most effective without testing them on an individual.

I guess my ultimate point is people say that real medicine is tested and has been determined to work. Which I don't agree with but it is not a perfect system. There is less incentive to test the efficacy of herbal remedies because they can't necessarily be monetized and a lot of drug research is funded by pharmaceutical companies. 

In the case I listed I believe the companies publish studies that show the drug working better than a placebo and didn't publish the studies showing them being less effective.

Finally in my mind I think homeopathy or trying to induce the placebo effect has a place for illnesses that are either largely mental or are quality of life issues and not necessarily life threatening. I realize homeopathy is not ""real medicine"" but there are times where drugs can cause unnecessary side effects and where some placebo could be helpful even if it doesn't do anything other than help the patient feel better or stop worrying about the problem.",0,1346789057,null,0,false,0,c63fbom,t3_zbwgh,t1_c63fbom,t1_c63f4pw,null,1429816708,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Well if you don't lie to them then I can see that being understandable, under informed consent. But not telling them IS a violation of good medical practice because you're being outright dishonest to your patient and that violates the trust of the patient in both you and the profession.

What they do in Germany is none of my concern, what happens here in the UK is, and that's what the good medical practice guide refers to. The statement from the GMC regarding homeopathy/placebo is only within the good medical practice guide, that is as long as the patient is fully informed.

Also, off the top of my head:

* The 'nanny state': excessive Health and Safety regulations etc.
* The NHS is great when you need it, but is not very flexible or helpful when it comes to 'routine' healthcare.
* Everything is as expensive as fuck

It's a pity about pharmaceuticals but they are a business at the end of the day and not a charity. That's the reason why we don't have any new antibiotics coming through, and many minor diseases don't have pharmacological treatments specifically designed for them. But that's business for you and it's the same here as well.

About the efficacy of alternative therapies it's much like the quote 'the reason they're alternative is because they have no evidence, if they had evidence they'd be conventional medicine'. [Here](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=comparison+of+homeopathy+to+placebo&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5) are some comparisons for homeopathy. It's much the same for most alternative therapies. They HAVE been tested in randomised-double blind clinical trials and have been proven to show no more effect than a placebo. But the so-called 'authorities' of the field tend refuse to accept the trials saying that their field cannot be measured properly by science, etc.

I agree that homeopathy can be good as a placebo and it may be good to help the patient feel better, but what I can't accept is the NHS that is based upon providing evidence-based effective treatment for patients is to propagate a lie and give a veneer of legitimacy to homeopathy by providing it through the NHS.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I didn't mean to combine the effectiveness of homeopathy with other supplements/herbal remedies. Again my knowledge is only about psychiatry but there is some evidence that St. John's Wort, 5-HTP and SAM-e can be effective for treating depression. There are also conflicting studies, it is this I was comparing to the other drug trials where there isn't an incentive for someone to push out only favorable evidence for St. John's Wort because it is harder to monetize than a drug a company made themselves.

Again I think many of your points make more sense with a government controlled or supported health system (I apologize if those terms aren't right.) instead of the US system. Nobody here is telling anyone to go to homeopaths and legitimizing it. I agree that is problematic. 

Some of the problem comes from people demanding a quick fix for their problems. They want a cure now, in general people don't want to make lifestyle changes (like exercising more or dietary changes) to improve their health, they want a pill to take now. That is why I think sham medicine has a place instead of giving real chemicals which can cause real side effects for patients. I don't know how you would go about setting up this kind of system and I realize it has lots of potential problems but this is what I was arguing in favor of.

Homeopathy should not be this system because it does give legitimacy to an ineffective system.

That's the basically the cause of a placebo, people think they have a magical healing drug, they feel a bit better and the ball rolls so to speak. 

The issue is, for viral infections, placebo's aren't so good, and in the case of a lot of other none viral diseases they're completely useless.

If people are homeopaths then fine, but this shit should not be put on the NHS, because then you have serious issues with people getting treated with homeopathy for illnesses where they really need proper medicine.

Turn up around 5 mins before the feature actually starts (say 10-15 minutes after the scheduled time) giving you enough of a chance to scan the layout of any potential upstarts and reducing the chance of any late-comers sitting in front or behind you, forget about everyone else and enjoy. 

Keep an eye out for bored looking girlfriend types (especially at man-films such as Dredd) as they have the potential to whip out their sun-bright smartphones and browse Facebook for most of the film (make sure you sit laterally or in front) and do not sit in front of elderlies nor groups of young lads.  They more often than not talk ALL the way through a film, I've experienced.

It's a bit of an art unto itself.

Remember, Dredd's not exactly arthouse and there will be plenty of big visuals and loud noises throughout.  You'll likely be less aware of any potential distractions and thankfully Dredd is an 18 which reduces the likelihood of distracting teenagers.

The team I selected is obviously nowhere near out strongest but this season the manager has said his focus is on the league. Sending the likes of Suarez, Agger, Gerrard etc. to these games and risk them picking up an injury could have a huge effect on our league campaign. This year is a building year and with such a thin squad we don't have the luxury of focusing on winning this tournament. Since Rodgers has this year to build the team and get them playing the way he wants, I'd rather we let the young players go on these European trips, get a bit of experience playing with some of the older squad members (Carra, Downing, Cole) and mature as players. If Rodgers does this and we get knocked out of the Europa League group stages I won't be one bit critical because at least he's giving players a chance.",0,1346794418,null,0,1346794700,0,c63gssb,t3_zcjp6,t1_c63gssb,t3_zcjp6,null,1429817397,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

&gt;
&gt;==== 
&gt;
&gt;Following yet another summer where off the pitch activities at Liverpool Football Club have dominated the headlines, we once again find the club ownership attempting to explain away business decisions that have overshadowed footballingmatters. 
&gt;
&gt;Spirit of Shankly reiterates its stance that the position of manager at Liverpool Football Club should be supported with all of the resources at the club's disposal. However, events of last Friday and the subsequent ""open letter"" from the club's Principal Owner, John W Henry, indicate that almost two years into FSG's ownership of the club this is not yet the case. 
&gt;
&gt;As pointed out by the union in May, there remains no ownership presence on this side of the Atlantic. It is our opinion that this situation has led directly to the ""mistakes"" alluded to in Mr Henry's open letter. Should the club's absentee owners not wish to establish a full-time base in Liverpool, it remains imperative that they appoint a Chief Executive of acalibre commensurate with the club's global status, to act with the full authority of the owners in their absence. Without this Chief Executive, it is far from sufficient for a club of Liverpool's stature to have a part-time Chairman, based on another continent, with various other interests, and from whom little or nothing of consequence is seen or heard. In case FSG need reminding, they are now employing their third manager, have already dispensed with the services of their Director of Football and now accusatory fingers are pointing in the direction of their Managing Director. 
&gt;
&gt;The questions posed of FSG by Spirit of Shankly during the close season remain unanswered. If the board is based in Boston, why has no Liverpool-based Chief Executive been appointed to oversee the club's affairs? It is almost two years since Liverpool Football Club was sold to FSG, with the stadium development being a condition of the sale, yet still no decisions have been made and still communication with fans and neighbouring residents alike remains patchy at best. Commendably FSG will not sanction the spending of money the club has not got, but why not increase the money available to the club through selling shares to supporters? 
&gt;
&gt;There comes a point at any football club where the Chairman has to step forward on behalf of the board and be held accountable for decisions that they have made and strategies that they have implemented. With key questions continuing to go unanswered, Spirit of Shankly suggests it is time for Tom Werner to be held accountable as Chairman of Liverpool Football Club. After all, the buck stops with him, not with those acting with his authority and not with people no longer at the club.",0,1346794929,null,0,false,0,c63gxtg,t3_zcu9u,t1_c63gxtg,t1_c63grzg,null,1429817456,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11
