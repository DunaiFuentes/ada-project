I've got work experience in video editing and subediting/graphic design work in print publishing, both at an international, London-based publishing house. I've volunteered with the local wildlife trust on conservation projects and built boules and croquet courts for the elderly in a local village. I've lodged in someone's bedroom in another town at expense to others who I had to borrow money from, just to take a week-long assessment for my suitability for an apprenticeship in an artisan craft (these guys were dead solid though and recognised the awkward and untenable position I'd put myself in just to _try_ for a job and paid me just for hovering around them learning for a week, very cool blokes). I worked a day at a call centre after I was just supposed to go in for an interview - the guy claimed he wanted me to take five minutes on the phone to see how I did, then wandered off and left me working for his group for the next six hours. And I did it like a mug, thinking it was proving something to him, before getting up and asking him if he wanted anything else from me before I fucked off. But despite this I can't get a fucking job at Waitrose or Morrisons stacking shelves.

It's not as simple as ""do volunteer work"". I even had to cancel my application for jobseeker's allowance because the only available Jobcentre is three towns over and too much hassle (and money) to reach reliably. Everyone's situations are different and all the fucking volunteer work in the world isn't going to help that. Employers are interested in a) how long ago you last were employed, even though everyone and his dog has been out of work for the last two years, and b) how little you expect for a salary. That's if there are even any vacancies going in your area - if you're unlucky enough to live in a tiny barracks town don't expect to see any listed online, in the papers or acknowledged when you go knocking.

Stop acting like it's a case of perseverance and a can-do attitude. It's a problem that's feeding itself, with people who were unable to find work a couple of years ago as a consequence of the credit crunch (or recession or whatever we're calling it now) increasingly seen as unemployable due to their lack of recent work experience.

Generally when a position is advertised, they'll want the best person out of all that apply. Experience is an easy cop-out but they mostly want to know that you can do the job, do it well and fit in with the workplace ethos and what have you. They'll need to like you and be confident in your ability. 

So, if you don't have obvious direct experience you need to draw on other things to demonstrate why you would be a good fit for a job. You are entitled to use things from your degree such as group projects or your final year dissertation, and obviously you can mention any other jobs you had even if they were in different fields. 

It might also be good for you to see what sort of experience they want and see if you can get it, if there is a common theme. There might be something you can do on your own initiative. It shows ambition and that you're not just stewing and wasting your time.

If you've never even held a job or done any placements you might consider just getting a shop job for a while. Even that shows you can cope with going to work, dealing with people and other responsibilities and will bring in some cash.

 It might seem odd but hiring new people is risky, since training is costly and you don't know if they're going to turn out to cause problems or just go off sick all the time (yes, I've known of people hired for a job who never worked a day and spent a year off sick).

On your CV, are you making sure you can give an example of every quality they ask for in their advert and making direct, obvious links in your cover letter?

#I think part of the problem is that less people are making a meaningful effort at 'work experience' before leaving school. My school set aside two weeks at the end of year 11 where we had to sort our own work experience out. Loads of people wasted the opportunity by getting their mates to sign the form saying they were working but just spending the two weeks doing nothing.

**Charity Work**

You can start volunteering at 14, which gives you at least 2 years experience before you're starting to apply to most jobs. I used to volunteer at my local Oxfam shops on Saturdays. I was one of the few people who seemed to understand how important work experience is on your CV, and the manager seemed to pick up on that: within a year I was being given more responsibility than I'd have gotten at a paid job. By the time I was 16, I would be put in charge of the shop - cashing up, training people, working on the till, even representing the shop on TV.

4 hours a week is nothing when you're 14 and employers see you as someone who is hard-working, can stick with a job (volunteer 4 hours a week for 2 years), if you're even remotely competent you'll have been given loads of responsibility - another good point on your CV. You can then use this experience to get a better job, which gives you more relevant experience when you're 16 and move on from there.

If you're thinking 4 hours on a Saturday would seriously cut into your socialising, think again. They're usually really flexible with your shifts - I did 9-1 some weeks and 1-5 other weeks. They'll let you take days off much more than a paying employer and so long as it's not every other week and you're actually doing something while you're there, they'll appreciate the fact that you're volunteering your time and give you a good reference. If you also do maybe 1 or 2 full days around Christmas time, you can use it as an example of when you went 'above and beyond to meet customers' needs'. It's all about making whatever work experience you have sound as impressive and relevant to whatever they're asking for. 

I got a BT research internship mostly thanks to the excellent reference I got from my boss at Oxfam, which made me stand out from the other 16 year olds who just had GCSEs and two weeks work experience.

It definitely depends who you are, and what you're looking for though. 

&gt; Most of these courses are a giant scam and a waste of government money.

Maybe. You would be surprised how many people still don't have basic ability in things like reading and writing. It doesn't apply to many young people nowadays though, so I guess it isn't really relevant to this thread. I know what you mean though, like you say, the government certainly over-pays for these courses, and most of them are very basic.

That said, I think there is some value in the system. If supported, these schemes could grow into something more useful - but for me work-experience opportunities have to be the focus of the job centre when dealing with young people.

Why on earth is the 'interviewer' making this person apologise on behalf of a whole class of people? She is being made to feel guilty for actually having a job (if the claims are true), and implicitly condoning the loss of a considerable proportion of the generation to temporary housing. Exactly, we are missing much context and the 'ordinary person' isn't speaking for herself she is being asked to speak on behalf of all like her, and she isn't just speaking, she was sought out to contribute to a pre-decided narrative which then was all editorialised.

Economics is a complex issue and the BBC and other state-sponsoring media are doing nothing but find scapegoats.

What people aren't realising is there is a transference of wealth that is happening quite slowly that involves one of the many contradictions of Capitalism. The hierarchy requires a large lump of workers and an even greater amount of consumers, but at the same time the Capitalists seek to deny jobs (partly through mechanisation but mostly politics) and create systems that leave the poor with less wealth than the generation before all the while demanding ever increasing amounts of spending: petrol, food, rent, power, tax. There is all this production and not enough wealth in not enough hands to keep the system going.

Their first gig in Bradford, at the Gaumont (Odeon) was 21 December 1963. Their second one on 9 October 1964 (same venue).

The confusion here is that the their 1964 gig in Bradford was the starting date for their UK Autumn Tour. *That's* the bit that Bradford is actually famous for (with regard to the Beatles).

They had played hundreds of gig before they ever got to Bradford.

It wasn't their first tour, either. In 1964 alone, they'd done a Spring UK Tour and a Canada and US Tour in the summer. And also a summer tour of the UK and Sweden.

1963 was their breakthrough year:

Scotland Winter Tour

UK Winter Tour

UK Spring Tour

Spring tour with Roy Orbison

UK Summer Tour

Scotland Mini Tour (Autumn)

UK Autumn Tour

Sweden Autumn Tour

Eight Christmas shows, the first one of which was performed in... Bradford (this was their first Bradford gig).

The two most recent being Luiz and Ramires from Benfica. But we've had Bosingwa, Ferreira and Carvalho all from Porto who have all served this club well in their own right. 

I also think Hulk is a very good player. Whilst some people worry about Hazard's slight frame, Hulk has 4 inches and a lot more brawn on him to help him settle in more quickly. 

Regarding Ramires, I think he'd be played in a more reserved role i.e the first two in a 4-2-3-1 formation to help control the game and become our engine. It would also settle Sturridge who believes he is more suited to CF and he can replace Torres on occassions where it is deemed apt.

Rule #1 - The doctor lies.   There was more of a reason to lie at the beginning of his life than the end.  At the start of 10's life he wanted to keep rose from freaking out, and at the end he was talking to himself. 

In the canon, each incarnation prefers a slightly different look, has unique set of preferences, and a slightly different way of doing things.  So the question is what makes up a person? If it includes the personality and preferences then you have new people each and every regeneration.  

Personally? I think of them as the same doctor who goes through a lobotomy with each change.  It's mostly there, but you've got a few differences.  Enough that it's the same person, but not really.  Close enough though that I can think of them as different faces on the same person.

The more interesting issue, beyond this implication whether or not she has a job, is whether it is valid to challenge ordinary people in this quite blunt way about their use of benefits. To some extent whether the media is licensed to do that, and to some extent whether society at large is licensed to. This is about whether benefits for individuals should be considered in legal or moral terms. If she did have parents with a big house and plenty of space, would we expect her not to claim housing benefit? On the other hand, if we legislate for that situation (as they would in America), there are lots of people who simply would not have a home (because their parents are bastards or have a small house) and many, many people in the same position as this woman - that such a thing could be done, but it would be unpleasant and stressful.

So on the one hand, I can see why the interview might be challenged, on the other hand I can see its illustrative purpose (both for and against Housing Benefit).

&gt;* 
No paid holidays at all. No paid sick leave. No paid maternity/paternity leave.

&gt;* No maximum hours/day in many states. No real legislation on over-time.

&gt;* Employers in many states ""own"" all creative works employees produce in their private time by default (i.e. unless a court can be convinced it is unreasonable).

Hourly employees do not get paid holidays / sick time, but federal law enforces paid maternity leave - paternity leave is much less widespread, but some of the more progressive areas of the country have it. Salaried workers are given paid holidays (non-christian religious holidays as well) and paid sick time on a yearly basis. The downside here is that in many places you cannot accrue paid time off because your remaining sick / vacation time is eliminated at the end of the fiscal year. 

Maximum hours /day is STRICTLY enforced for hourly workers (especially those under age 18), but much less so for salaried workers. There are certainly companies in the United States which believe they own all of your time for ""allowing"" you to work there, but that is much more a symptom of their current economic state, and the availability of jobs vs the number of applicants.

When accepting a job offer from a company some jobs (artists, programmers, jobs where related material could earn the employee money while on company time) require you to sign a consent form to waive all rights to intellectual property created while employed there, but in general it is only for work done in their facility, on company time, or using their equipment; not on your own time / in your home etc.",0,1338311960,null,0,false,0,c4tpm6h,t3_u9wp0,t1_c4tpm6h,t1_c4tmmel,null,1429023695,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"1. A sterotype of the average soldier is a young, working class man who might see it as their only chance at a career. For people who fit this stereotype, the military usually serves them well. In reality, there's a wide range of people who join for various reasons, often because it's a steady and secure job, or because they want to serve their country. There's certainly not a widespread negative stereotype, as you said there is in Germany.

2. I personally don't see soldiers as better or worse than the average person. However, going to war is a horrible and dangerous thing, and you have to admire the bravery of someone who would want to do that. For example, I have a cousin training to be a Royal Marine, and I admire him greatly because you have to be incredibly dedicated and resilient to manage in that branch of the military. Also, as Mokoba said, there's fairly recently been a trend in the tabloid press that makes everyone in the military out to be a hero, in the same way that Americans view their forces, and I don't really believe in that.

3. Yeah, it's a good career path. If you want to be in the military for life then obviously it's a steady job, and for people who leave, it provides good training and experience in general. I believe the pension is quite good as well, although I'm not sure. 

4. Fairly regularly. My hometown is fairly near a large military base, so I occasionally see soldiers. I went to school with a lot of people whose parents were in the military and lived on this base, so I probably have more contact with military people than the average person. When I see them in uniform, they strike me as smart, fit and disciplined, all good qualities. I always see soldiers at the train station on their way back to the base, and it always strikes me how young some of them are. A few of them look younger than me, and I sort of feel sorry for them. I can't really imagine someone my age or younger having to go abroad and fight.

5. I think Remembrance Day is very worthwhile. I think it's very important to remember and thank people who died fighting for the country, particularly in WW2. In terms of the current war in Afghanistan, while I may not agree with it, I think it's important we remember people who have been killed fighting in it. Wearing a poppy isn't seen as a political statement, just a mark of remembrance. It's up to you whether you wear one.

Its always the better choice to pick up someone with experience; fewer risks and less training required, and given the level of unemployment you shouldn't struggle to find someone suitable.

In the 70's, children went to their local primary school until the age of 11, when they would all take the 11 plus exam, which was very similar to the kind of questions you get in an IQ test ... and on the basis of the results of that exam, the children were assigned to different types of schools:

Grammar schools, for the highest scoring pupils, which focused mainly on academic subjects; Technical High schools, for the mid range pupils, which focused on both academic subjects and practical skills such as woodwork and metalwork; and Secondary Modern schools, for the lowest scoring pupils, which focused on practical skills and the basics of reading and writing and maths

It wasn't perfect, and the schools for the lowest scoring pupils often ended up full of trouble and bad reputations, and one of the biggest complaints about the system was that it disadvantaged the pupils who were late developers, so it certainly needed to be improved, but Labour's solution was to make the entire education system into Comprehensive schools where every child had equal opportunities ... a nice ideal but it disadvantaged the most academically talented pupils who would be held back by a curriculum and pace which was suited to the majority

Many people felt that the solution was somewhere in the middle, with mostly Comprehensive schools, but retaining some Grammar schools, and perhaps some smaller schools for children who needed more help with the basics of reading and writing ... but Labour was insisting that all the Grammar schools had to comply with plans to become Comprehensives, and some Grammar schools were fiercely resisting ... and with the threat of legal action hanging over them, they held on until the Conservatives were elected ... the Conservatives didn't reverse the mostly-Comprehensive plan, but they saved some Grammar schools and made the 11 plus exam optional

true,StormySan,eng-westmidlands,Brummagem,"&gt; [1]If you are doing work experience your entitlement to the National Minimum Wage (NMW) depends on the arrangements under which you are working.

&gt; One of the following categories will apply:

&gt;* you are a worker and eligible for the NMW
&gt;* you are a worker, but expressly exempt in the legislation and not eligible for the NMW
&gt;* you are not a worker and therefore not eligible for the NMW

Exemptions are classed as:

&gt;* [1]Students doing work experience **as part of a course**
&gt;* Being of compulsory school age
&gt;* Working for a specificly excempted organisation eg: charity, voluntary organisation, etc...

A ""worker"" is classed as someone who

&gt;* [2]has a contract of employment
&gt;* has a contract to perform work or provide services personally for their employer
&gt;* is not self-employed under the contract

Unless the company is a charity or otherwise exempted, or you're a student, calling a job ""work experience"" is just a con:

&gt; If you are entitled to the National Minimum Wage, you cannot give up your entitlement **even if you agree with your employer** to be paid a wage below the NMW

**TL-DR; If a company offers you an unpaid internship or work experience and requires that you have regular hours and a contract, and you're not a student, then you are legally entitled to the national minimum wage, and they are behaving illegally.**

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"I'm thinking Hulk is the only remaining ""big name"" signing we need to make. From there, sign a new right back, van der Wiel seems the most likely prospect. 

From there, we're pretty much set.

Goalkeeper: Cech is solid. Hilario isn't bad but he faced a fair amount of injuries last season. I think Turnbull was preferred late in the year as a way to give him a final assessment. He failed. Replace Turnbull. I don't ever like seeing him play. Bad play all around and typically paired with young players in Carling Cup/FA Cup matches. A nice, experienced goalkeeper would allow younger players to play more freely and make more mistakes without watching the ball go in the back of the net (and killing their confidence, ruining the experience etc.).

Left back: Cole and Bertrand should be able to handle all responsibilities. Ben Gordan and Patrick van Aanholt are around but will likely be shipped back out on loan. Would be cool to have PVA and Bruma on loan together at Hamburg.

Centre back: JT, Luiz and Cahill will take the majority of minutes. Ivanovic can provide cover but likely best used out right. I feel uneasy about not really having a youth team CB (Chalobah has been used mostly as a midfielder of late from what I understand, too soon for Ake) to be used for lower league matches and the like though. Would have liked to have Bruma around, maybe Tomas Kalas will be that guy. Would not make a big signing for this position though (a la Javier Martinez)

Right back: New signing required, to split time with Ivanovic. Ferreira's future remains to be seen, possibly Todd Kane can take some Carling Cup minutes.

Going forward, I'm assuming a return to the 4-2-3-1 formation.

Deep midfielders: Would be very wise to have one dedicated defensive midfielder on the pitch at all times, given we have a very strong attacking quartet in front of our mids. I'd expect Mikel to retain his place and hopefully people start to understand just how crucial his role is. Romeu can take the lower level matches and hopefully challenge Mikel for some more minutes. Beside him, I'd have Lampard and Meireles take most of the minutes. Essien can be used to cover either deep midfield role. I fully expect Josh McEachran to go back out on loan. Chalobah may get some time here but I doubt it. I could be surprised though. A bit of talk about Modric incoming and so long as he's played beside Mikel, that could actually work out really well. I feel a midfielder would be forced to depart in those circumstances, and Essien would be the odd man out. Which would be another difficult departure to swallow, because I love Essien. Full homo, because I.don't.give.a.FUCK.

Left Wing/Central Attacking Midfield: Hazard and Mata will take most of the time and possibly rotate through these two positions. Marin will be the squad player here, he's capable of playing in either positions as well. Piazon could be a youth player who'll be played here but I feel he's better to go out on loan. de Bruyne, Kakuta, Davila, same situation, but Kakuta/KDB may be left with the first team.

Right wing: Ramires and I'm hoping Hulk come in bound. If no Hulk, depend on Ramires to take much of the minutes, and a squad player to come in. Hulk is nice because he can also cover CF, that's why he'd be an ideal player for me. Ramires is also extremely versatile and fill in at so many positions. We don't really have that many right sided players in our youth team/reserves. So a mid-20s, midtable type player may take the pressure off this side and won't make it difficult with a huge ego. Might not be the right time for Kalou to go, since that's basically who he is.

Centre forward: Into the unknown. Torres will be who we depend on for goals next year, with Sturridge moved to CF. I expect Lukaku to go on loan almost for sure, Patrick Bamford likely to follow. Would love to see Islam Feruz get some Carling Cup matches, and at most FA Cup early rounds. We do need another guy in the depth chart. I don't think Falcao or Cavani, etc, are the right guys, they'll expect to play all the game and we have Torres for that. For better or worse, to be honest I'm a touch nervous - he needs to start banging in the goals or else I'd expect a January move for a clinical striker. Hulk is a nice player here because he fills in two jobs without really unsettling the squad and is perfect for rotational.

The way our team is shaping up on paper, it could be our strongest since our 09 Double or even the historic 2004-2005 team. Very excited for the upcoming season.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"This is precisely my stance. Moreover I think that although there are occasional dips into less-than-stellar writing through some companion's tenures, they've acted their roles admirably.

Piper was incredible, especially for her young age. She managed to portray such an incredibly real and relateable character, which I think was absolutely vital in the New Series inception.

I think Freema did a superb job following after, and I think that she managed to mature into the role quite well (despite the tendency for the show to put her in the less-than-savory role of ""Not Rose"").

And Tate's performance was brilliant. She could do lightning fast comedy right off the cuff and could still do really deep emotional sequences in a way that showed immense believability. With this brilliant performance married with snappy writing, Donna is *easily* my favorite companion of the New Series.

Amy...

...enh.

Karen's a brilliant person, to be sure. But as an actress she's just... a bit underqualified for a leading role. I think that Moffat's vision of Doctor Who being about the companions really pushed her into the unfair position of having to carry the show, something she simply was not ready to do.

Alex Kingston gave a *brilliant* performance in Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead. She handled the incredibly complex and mixed position of having so much to say and not being able to say it. That's great. Lately however she's been one-dimensionalized. What was once a rich and complex character is now a winking, flirting, lipstick wearing stereotype. It's really disappointing, as her character had so much promise.

But Arthur Darville consistently gives a *brilliant* performance, which is really impressive considering how little screentime and actual moments of development Rory has. At no point does Rory not feel like a real person. Not a lot of characters in Doctor Who can say that.

And Noel Clarke was jut someone I loved. I really did enjoy his performance, despite again how little of a role he got compared to others.

The only *companion* (not actress, but character) that I genuinely feel is mishandled is Amy. She really should be a richer and more engaging character, whose broken and imperfect and really cracked from the Doctor's messing up her childhood, but she's often reduced to important-sounding but meaningless titles like ""the Girl Who Waited"".

true,dumbledorkus,null,null,"I wouldn't put the Doctor in Ravenclaw. I know these have just been done so you get all four houses but I wouldn't put him in Ravenclaw and here's why.

Ravenclaws value learning. That doesn't mean they're super intelligent already and it doesn't mean that all intelligent people are Ravenclaws. The key point of a Ravenclaw is the desire to learn. The obsessive pursuit of knowledge for knowledge's sake. Look at Luna! She's a Ravenclaw, but you wouldn't think of her as incredibly intelligent straight away with all her talk of crumple horned snorlarks and nargles. No, it's her desire to *learn*, regardless of how stupid the subject matter mat seem, that sets her apart.

Now the Doctor, oh the Doctor. He clearly values knowledge, and has a lot of it, but gaining it isn't his prime motivator. No, if he wanted *more* knowledge he's going about it all wrong. He shoots off to travel the universe and save planets. So what does he want? Adventure then, which is why I think the Doctor would make a fine Gryffindor. His knack for irresponcibly flinging himself and his friends into danger echos Harry Potter's attitude. Saving planets, fighting monsters and destroying whole races certainly seem to fit the ""brave deeds"" that Godric Gryffindor was looking for. More importantly is his inner courage. The stuff that makes him soldier on through all the terrible shit he's experienced with a smile, the stuff that lets him be the one to make whatever horrible moral disision the universe has thrown at him that day. Yes, the Doctor is sad, he's lonely, he's smart, but above all that he is *very very brave.*

Alright, while I'm here lets look at the others. Rory seems like a good place to start becase lets be honest - that's damn right. Hufflepuff. He's loyal as hell, that's easy to see, he's the last centurian for crying out loud... but he's also hardworking and just. Whether it's being a listening ear for an upset flesh avatar or wanting to save the older Amy he's always trying to be fair. Rory is awesome.

Amy? Well, she could be Gryffindor I geuss. Certainly she shows bravery in some situations but frankly it feels like I'm calling Gryffindor by default. She's not keen to learn, she's definately not loyal or fair, she's not particularly ambitious or cunning but then I don't think she's that brave either. She draws a lot of bravery from the Doctor, when [spoiler](/s ""she sees him die"") she gives up immediately - NOT the Gryffindor way. Many times when she does show that bloody minded attitude she's just depending on him to come and save her and the one time she lost that faith (The Girl Who Waited) she broke down and became a colossal bitch. A self sufficient bitch though, so Gryffindor it is.

Last but never, ever least we've got River. River is my favourite. Thing is we've got the opposite problem with River. That classy mother fucker could be any house if she's spun right. The first thing that strikes me about her is her bravery. Not the ""running around space and time shooting things"" bravery, that's just a side effect, but like the Doctor she has the courage to lie to everyone even though she knows it will hurt them and perhaps more importantly even though it kills her. I wouldn't say that defines her though, so lets take a closer look at what Slytherin values and see if that fits.

Firstly lets just point out Slytherin doesn't value evil (damn you Gryffindor media!) at all so all of that ""bespoke phsycopath"" stuff can be disregarded. Look at Snape. He certainly wasn't evil. Perhaps you could paralell River and Snape - in love from a young age, [spoiler](/s ""responcible, in some way, for the death of their true love""), lying to both sides. And what Snape has that makes him a Slytherin is cunning. He'll do anything to get what he wants - to protect Harry for Lily. He takes the wrap for killing Dumbledore because of it. Sound familiar? Now of course we know River is very, very sly. To attract the Doctor, which is all she really wants in life, she finds inventive ways of sending messages through space and time. To organise to be picked up literally *in space* at a random point in time she plays on her knowledge of the Doctor spectacularly well. That's pretty damn Slytherin.

I'm not liking River as a Slytherin, it fits though. Maybe it's just house prejudice again. ~~Still, this already got far to long and I have to go. I'll be back later to wrap up.~~ Just in case though, we'll examine River as a Hufflepuff. ""Hufflepuff?!"" I hear you cry, ""What on earth could Rory and River have in common?!"" Well, for starters I don't see River as a Ravenclaw at all. Sure, she studies and she goes on expeditions but I don't think it's a want for knowledge that drives her. We saw what she was like in school. That leaves Hufflepuff who as we all know value loyalty and equality. They work hard to acheive their ends and as I already said River works incredibly hard. She forged her own path in the world and used the knowledge and technology she'd accumulated by her self to get where (and when) she wanted. Infact that part of our house knowledge is acctually phrased ""unafraid of toil"" which could also refer to non-work related struggles- something she faces every day with a stiff upper lip. She is loyal to the Doctor against all odds, even when he doesn't trust her or is hurtful. We know from her cheeky remarks that race, gender and species are irrelevant to her in dating (and therefore probably sex) so we can assume that bleeds out into the rest of her life. The problem is, of course, that house prejudice I mentioned. River would make an excellent Hufflepuff, sure, but it all comes back to that house predjudice.

&gt;It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.

Can you see River Song choosing to be a Hufflepuff over a Slytherin with that ""bad girl"" attitude of hers? I think not.

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"It's easy for a lot of people who the words aren't aimed at to say that the words shouldn't/don't hurt people, but this is pretty much the majority who aren't abused telling the minority who are abused how they should feel.

For example, my gay friend was beaten up by a group of young lads who all were calling him a 'faggot' etc. He is gay and he saw it as abuse he received because of his sexuality (which it was.) Now he doesn't like it when people use the word 'faggot' especially when calling it him. He knows it's a blatant attack on his sexuality (something he cannot change) and sees it also as a word which is unnecessary to use because the only real reason a person would use it is if they were being homophobic. There's TONS of other words (with no history of being used to abuse a subset of people) that people can choose to call him, but when they call him a 'faggot' it brings all these memories back and he hates it.

Now using your logic you'd tell him that he shouldn't be offended by that word because it's just a word (he's been told this by people who work with him too) and he just replies that it's not up to you to decide whether or not he's allowed to be offended when you use an openly homophobic slur against him, a gay person.

Basically, it's all very well saying that X shouldn't offend or that people who are offended by X are Y, but it's not really the place of someone who hasn't suffered that abuse, to tell someone who has suffered that abuse how they need to feel about it.

Personally I have no problem with this woman going to prison. She was harassing other passengers and repeatedly made threats of violence. She reportedly had a previous criminal history of doing similar things which also shows us it wasn't a one off. I think if we let the idea that it's okay to abuse and harrass someone in a racist/sexist/whateverist way in real life, then those behaviours become a part of peoples thought processes, and enter into businesses and positions of power, where they become institutionalized discrimination. Stamping out this bigotry is a great thing to do, and although education from an early age would be an amazing thing to have, the parents who hold these views in public need to be taught that what they're saying is taboo and unacceptable. I think this will lead their children to understand that it's not acceptable to have this kind of bigotry out for all to see.

I had almost a year of agony with two impacted wisdom teeth while waiting for the NHS to give me an appointment. I went to my dentist who did the referral and it took 9 months for them to get me an X-ray and another 3 months to finally get me sat in the chair ready for removal.

The guy who did the removal in an NHS hospital was clearly inexperienced. There was an older lady with him telling him what to do. Took him 40 minutes to remove the lower tooth, with pushing, pulling and then having to cut the gum to get it out.

Once they were (finally) done, they bundled me out of the door with an A5 leaflet about how to cope after anaesthetic. They had crossed several parts of the leaflet out with a biro.. very professional.

I was in agony for days, and had a terrible taste in my mouth, but I thought it was normal. They told me to rinse with mouthwash, and I did this regularly. But after days, I was still in agony. I did some googling, and apparently mouthwash is a HUGE no-no because it flushes out the clot and causes dry socket.

I booked an emergency appointment with a private dentist who saw me the same day, cleaned out the hole, put in a dressing soaked with antiseptic, gave me prescription painkillers and antibiotics. After 3 days, I felt INFINITELY better.

But let's be honest - universities doing this are being greedy and stupid. And I think if they can't justify charging that much, it will come back and bite them in the arse.

Oxford, Cambridge, Durham, Imperial etc.. yes, these Universities can charge £9000/yr because a degree from there will easily let you pay it off over your working life. International student fees are already very high for those places too.

But Leicester.. really...? I'm not being snobby, but I wonder if they are being a bit over-optimistic about what people will be willing to pay to go there. Also, iirc, Universities will be fined if they can't fill all spaces in their courses, which is what will happen if they charge more than their worth.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"To a degree, Chinese and Japanese (they are different, not bunched together here) cultures are mirrored by individuals who enjoy it. If anything, I do think they both could export their culture more as an antidote to the rather sterile status quo we have with America.

In terms of the UK and US cultures, well, I've found increasingly that at least England has significant self-definition issues. We don't seem to believe in ourselves with much pride, and that's pretty disappointing. When you look at the 1960's and 1970's in terms of music, some pretty amazing stuff started and grew popular both domestically and internationally. 

I think part of the problem is probably the lack of an export to be proud of, in near enough every form, and we don't have anything to contrast our existing situation with. For example, if you look at Scotland, they're proud of their heritage, and they do have some historical reasons to be proud. In terms of sporting achievements though, it's clear they do enjoy defining their national football team in contrast to that of England. Even if it isn't serious rivalry with some people, it creates an identity that can be latched onto. We seem to lack that kind of spirit across England.

I'd also say stuff like the EDL and BNP provide negative identities to latch on to. They're explaining the absence of positivity through negative emotion, which serves to perhaps fill some kind of void. The question of 'What does it mean to be English?' just seems so empty.

Returning to my original point though; I do suspect as China becomes more powerful it would benefit from exporting it's culture. It already ought to, as there are some excellent films and media that they could benefit from exporting. Equally so could Japan.

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"I'm not trying to diminish your experience here, but i think there's a big difference between what you've experienced, and institutionalized discrimination. You've had incidents of personal racism, but nothing that is institutionalized. You won't ever have to worry that when you're pulled over by the dibble it's because of the colour of your skin. You won't ever have to deal with people questioning why you got the job (colour of your skin or actual talent etc), and you most certainly won't ever experience institutionalized racism. For example, you are more likely  to get a job if your name is more 'white' sounding, than ethnic sounding: http://www.chicagobooth.edu/capideas/spring03/racialbias.html

Of course you're not offended by people calling you a whiteboy, that word has never been used to systematically oppress people. It's like when white people are called 'crackers', it isn't really offensive because it was never used by the majority in power to marginalise the majority who had no power.

Maybe you should watch this louis ck bit, to understand how words can have different meanings for different people:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-55wC5dEnc

And also Louis Ck's own personal repsonse about his 'faggot' bit on stage:

&gt; I did those bits as a kind of analysis of the words and what feelings they bring and how they're used. I was playing with some fire. It was interesting. I think that the discussion of the word faggot that I did in the poker scene was a bit of an evolution. I pretty much never say faggot on stage anymore. It's just worked it's way into and out of my act. It's not interesting anyomre and i""m not goign to say it just to say it.

source: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/n9tef/hi_im_louis_ck_and_this_is_a_thing/

Or maybe Chris Rock's response about his black people vs. niggers bit, which he stopped doing because people were using it as an excuse to be racist, just like people use louis ck as an excuse to be bigoted

&gt;""I think a lot of people were thinking in those terms and hadn't been able to say it. By the way, I've never done that joke again, ever, and I probably never will,"" says Rock. ""'Cause some people that were racist thought they had license to say nigger. So, I'm done with that routine.""

Source: http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/02/17/60minutes/main674768.shtml

His bit about 'license to say nigger' applies pretty much universally to the license to say faggot thing. If your friends are okay with you calling it them, then that's fine, as long as you don't (as some people do) think that it suddenly gives you a pass to say it to every gay person, or casually in conversation.

And your equivalence of 'cocknose' to 'faggot' doesn't really work. One is a personal insult which has never been used to systematically oppress or abuse a marginalised group in society, and the other has. That's why 'cocknose' isn't as taboo/offensive to the general population as 'cocknose'

In which case you have 2 first-team CAMs which is ""okay"" but I would prefer three in the case of injuries. Obviously we cannot have 3 star players so Shinji and Mata would have to rotate ;)


As far as Sturridge go, there is room for him but I do not feel he is good enough to play a season for Chelsea. For me he was a huge disappointment - but again, perhaps due to the fact he did not get his forward position he so wants. He was better when he was the striker for Bolton I feel. Did some good things. In that case there's space for him in a 4-1-2-1-2, with 2 striker slots and 4 to rotate.


Robert Lewandowski has been in fantastic form, and Shinji Kagawa likewise. Robert in a duo up front with either Torres or Zlatan is an orgasmic thought, man.


That said, the way Matteo is going with the team currently I would be genuinely surprised if he would go back to Mourinho's strat ;) There's just too many wingers on the Chelsea team atm.

EDIT: also not sure what you mean by ""out and out""


OOPS I forgot to address the ""talent"". Yeah - Abramovich wants trophies and that is why they should purchase the list I wrote up there, it's three proven top players that are in their beginning prime (Zlatan is still in his prime in my book with 28 nettings for Milan in the home cup this season and I have not even counted his assists yet). The talent just is not there yet. Get Lukaku out and run, loan them out. By the time they are reayd 4 years will have gone and Shinji, Lewandowski and Zlatan will be 27, 27 and 34. Then  they can rotate with the new blood or in Zlatan's case, retire. It is provocative, I know and I am no Zlatan fan. He just scores. That is what Chelsea needs - goals.

This is the kind of statement that really underlines why I think he is the right manager for us. With our struggles and uncertain future, we are not in a position where we can attract big name players and will have to improve with largely the same squad we had last year. 

My biggest disappointment with KD was that we seemed to have no clear vision of what the squad was and many matches, it seemed we were just throwing combinations of players and tactics at the wall in the desperate hope that something would change. Rodgers seems to have a philosophy and does a brilliant job of cultivating those talents in the squad needed to serve that philosophy.

true,spiffing_,eng-GreaterLondon,Croydon't,"1. I'm sorry, gonna get absolutely shot down probably. This is solely my opinio. But Army recruitment drives do actively hit towns and villages in desolate towns in places like the North East and the Midlands to take advantage of kids with no idea of the consequences, luckily not many make the tests. When I lived in County Durham the locals called it the 'Canon Fodder Drive' - trying to attract kids with no prospects.    Yeah the National Services have a lot of blue-blooded people working in senior careers there, but things like Pilots and Captain training take years worth of top notch schooling to qualify for.     2. In the UK right now, it's a difficult medium - the media are very pro forces, with charity campaigns and press awareness. But there at the same time - those who support the troops do not grasp why their tax money is funding a war in the middle east that has been going on for nine years with nothing but bad news. One other thing is that whenever a serviceman/woman is killed in fight abroad, they almost always are under 30 with children.    3. It depends on what the future of the services is set to be? The Navy and RAF have had huge budget cuts and the Army is strictly russian roulette unless you enter for a senior entry career there. With the economy as it is, (and believe it or not - Video games like COD) so many young people see the lure of 'touring' abroad and representing their country, however we know it isn't like that.    4. I have only ever ONCE seen a UK soldier in public wearing his uniform, and I am not sure how I felt about it. The Army forbids uniforms off duty, but is it a bit pretentious walking around in one. It's done for effect... not sure. Conversely, I got on a plane in Houston TX and saw all passengers shake a soldiers arm after he'd just recieved a free upgrade.    5. Remembrance Day, thanks to the twisting of the Media is slowly turning to a St Georges Day fiasco, where people will take it upon themselves to go overboard in the sake of Xenophobia.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Rentier - which for me represents those that have the power to decide what labour is done and who receives the lions share of the surplus. Talking about the abusive relationship between capital and its workforce, or how it isn't even a necessary construct, is often pushed to the periphery of socio-economics.

I'm not expecting the BBC to echo my opinions, what I do expect from the BBC is opinion management, sadly. Any topic or debate is framed from the outset whether intentionally or otherwise. The evocative montage softened us up to accept the conclusion of the debate, the government ""has to"" cut spending on the people so the introduction went. This looks like increasing taxation for the poorest, but decreasing taxation for business and the richest. The cliche of a fat, black, well dressed single mother couldn't get any better.

Then there was the horrid woman talking about Mumbai and how poverty is virtuous was absurd, wanting fewer benefits for the poor but pushing that money towards investment at the executive 'innovative' level; why was she even there? Are those of color supposed to have an easier time identifying with her and her opinions? The case for the financial crisis being estimated is strong, any one would think these are the end times, [but it has been worse](http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2012/05/29/uk-public-debt-1900-2010/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+org%2FlWWh+%28Tax+Research+UK+2%29).

We need to break away from seeing the population as workers that need to be employed, probably because much employment is simply not needed anymore. Production for productions sake is plainly absurd. [This is what full employment looks like.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=82w_r2D1Ooo) We need to talk about the obsession with growth and where it comes from. As a percentage of public expenditure the amount going to just serve the interest payments on the debt is increasing, and the compound effect means that the government have to take in more and pay out less each time. This idea of cutting spending is utter bullshit, they are cutting a very specific type of spending to offset increases elsewhere to the financial sector (I don't just mean the bailout). I want governance such that one five day working week can support a family.

During the debate they nearly revealed what the attacks on benefits are all about. Harriot Baldwin got a little bit too comfortable and nearly said it explicitly: she talked of farmers complaining about having to get their menial seasonal labour from Moldova (historically done by our students she says). She then added the complaint of her own about housing benefit being 'sticky, ya know, too sticky' (ie the labour force not easily *incentivised* to migrate because once you get benefit you are tied to that location) - her dubious reasoning. She literally wants to force unemployed people to move to jobs that students used to do? Where are the jobs anyway that empower people? We all can't work at Tescos. Presumably they aren't here yet because desperation isn't high enough, nor wages low enough. The Tory's want to expand the working class as quickly as possible, and make it as maleable as possible, and it needs the BBC to help us swallow the ideology.

A Christmas Carol (Easily my favorite special, brilliant in so many ways. It could have been just another rehash of the classic tale, but it chose to do it's own thing which was *brilliant*).

Midnight (Scary without the need for special effects, just the darkness in man's soul)

Dalek (What can I say? The Doctor's pushed to his limits and the Daleks are genuinely scary)

Bad Wolf/Parting of the Ways (I actually didn't mind the bit of tounge-in-cheek message this episode made and moreover it *killed Rose* (or made you believe it killed Rose) that was a *huge* shock. Then it *killed Jack*. The portrayal of people being slaughtered by Daleks never felt more real than in here. You honestly felt anyone can die, and a lot of people did.)

Boom Town (a lot of people ridicule this one, and I think it's residual distaste for the Slitheen. This episode wasw very personal and understated. The fact that it *nailed* the characters here really speaks a great deal)

The Girl in the Fireplace (a reminder of what the Doctor does to people, a wholly original concept, and a heartbreaking love story. And the under the bed scare genuinely made me jump, and that's not an easy feat)

Human Nature/Family of Blood (really questioning the Doctor, a real character examination wrapped in a brilliant concept... what if the Doctor was just some man in love?)

Blink (The creation of an iconic character? A clever nonlinear plot? This episode may not be the godlike perfection some fans claim, but it is the *perfect* introduction into New Who)

Partners in Crime (Genuinely hilarious, clever in how it intertwines Donna and the Doctor in fate, and a mindblowing finish. Have no clue why this episode isn't discussed more, it's brilliant)

Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead (It's not perfect, but from River's difficult balance of pain and unspoken wisdom to the creeping menace of the Vashta Nerada this episode makes up for it's flaws with clever concepts and superb acting.)

The Eleventh Hour (it peters in it's midsection, but this episode is *electric*. Easily the best introduction for a Doctor and that speech he gives the Atraxi is guaranteed to give you chills.)

The Doctor's Wife (although the script certainly deserves more than the show could give it this episode shines with clever writing, and brilliant character interaction between the Doctor and his TARDIS)

Closing Time (Again, hilarious. It gives nods to the past without being obnoxious and acts as a brilliant prelude to what would be the Doctor's final hours.)

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"Well that is good to know about Rodgers.  I think it certainly makes a difference what sort of connections your manager has, as he is still a big attraction for a player, whether or not he is negotiating with agents.  And I'm not 100% sure why everyone is saying ""all transfer business"" will be left for the DoF.  That seems extremely silly.  The manager needs to help identify targets and should be speaking with players, in my mind.  That doesn't mean he decides who he gets, but they have to be players he wants and will use, and ideally you'd like the layer to be able to meet and hear from the manager about vision before signing.  I think all FSG has said is that the transfer business will be cooperative among 2 or 3 positions, rather than say that the manager won't be involved.

Instead of pulling stuff from nowhere like ""boning in the Time Vortex means a Time Lord baby"" and ""Mel's been here the whole time"" they could have introduced these elements earlier with foresight to make the experience an actually natural one and not a contrived veer to suit the plot.

Further, Moffat blows his writing load too often. He wasted the ""all enemies uniting at once to defeat the Doctor"" on what was essentially a photo op as two Autons dragged him in a box. Did the Slitheen, Sycorax, or Judoon need to be there?

Further still, Moffat overuses the main character dying. We all know that he will survive, and yet Moffat acts like this isn't horribly obvious. He did it in the Fifth Series finale as he flew into the exploding TARDIS and again in the Sixth Series as a major point. It's blatantly clear that he's running out of ways to raise the stakes, so he reuses the same high stakes concept of ""the Doctor must die"".

Bad Wolf was a well laid plan. The Bad Wolf entity was Deux Ex Machina.

""Vote Saxton"" was a well laid plan. Tinkerbell Fairy Jesus Doctor was not.

I said that these elements were good examples, I didn't say that RTD was some sort of perfect writer.

And the ""I'm Pregnant"" thing in TIA was awful. It was senselessly raising the stakes. I mean, Rory's about to bite it and so it River. Amy says she's pregant. Amy shoots a kid.

Cut scene

Amy's not pregnant. Rory and River get out with zero explanation. Amy missed the kid (and literally says ""I'm glad I missed"", just to beat us over the head with it).

That wasn't well done, that was senseless drama. Why does the Doctor go to some random acid factory to learn about the Flesh? Wouldn't a Flesh Factory make more sense? They never explain this because it is indeed shoehorned in.

The fact that they didn't even bother with even *mentioning* Mels before her debut or the fact that *The episode prior* let you know that the missing baby is Melody, making it *blatantly obvious* that Mels is MElody is River. And yet they act like it's a surprise. They have the characters act dumber than the audience, and it's infuriating. Doctor Who is better than that.

The fact that they don't even mention how the Eleventh Doctor mid-regenerated before his death, something we do not see the Tesselecta doing, just shows how little thought they put into this series.

If Jenna-Louise IS slated to play a character called Susan Tyler, and if this Susan is the daughter of Rose and Human 10, things could get very icy very quick for 11. It would be him losing his companion(s?) and winding up meeting his daughter (well... his clone's daughter), whose mother is a woman he loved very much. 

According to Stephen Moffat, Jenna-Louise and Matt Smith had some great chemistry for what he was looking for, and what an excellent twist it would be to have a father travelling the stars with his daughter, when they look around the same age. 

If Susan Tyler ISN'T Rose Tyler's kid (or if she's not called Susan Tyler at all), Moffat is the Supreme Mind-Fucker out there, and I love/hate him dearly.

10yrs later when I left to move back up North - I was running the design/artwork dept.

I don't see anything wrong with embellishing your CV or even lying - IF you can do what you claim, and you genuinely think you can do the job.

Even if you don't want to do that, leaving off your A levels when you're applying for a job that doesn't need them isn't lying at all, you're just omitting information they don't need to see, and as long as the information your omitting isn't stuff like criminal convictions etc, then you're not doing anything wrong at all.

Even if your not in the North East - Care work is one sector where there are always jobs. Care is much more than wiping arses in old peoples homes, a lot of care work involves no 'personal care' at all.

I also listened to *The Four Doctors*, featuring a personal favorite, the Special Weapons Dalek.

After listening to the dramas, I haven't liked any characters less; they've all been great!  As seen in my list, I have been cherry-picking through the audio dramas, ~~so maybe I've avoided any dreadful ones~~ so the only not-good story I've heard thus far was *Doctor Who and the Pirates*.  I listened to that with a [friend](http://www.reddit.com/user/jkwright2012), and we couldn't take Evelyn Smythe's cheesy &amp; atrocious storytelling abilities.  The Doctor's corroboration didn't help out one bit neither.

My Doctor/companion of choice for the moment is Eight and Charley, both of whom I would love to see appear during the 50th anniversary celebrations.

I ""chose"" these even-numbered Doctors because I read on a couple occasions (including posts by you, if I remember correctly) that Colin Baker's incarnation gets fleshed out more and is portrayed as less abrasive than his televised TARDIS run.  Having not yet watched a complete serial of his (I started both *The Twin Dilemma* and *The Two Doctors*), I find his stories &amp; characterisation good enough to wear a flair of him like he would a cat brooch.  However, this all might change as I continue to listen to Paul McGann's romps throughout time and space.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"I don't know, while I admire the idea, it seems like the author has gone to great strides to make it seem much more extravagant than it is. For example, here's what I got from my journey attempting to go from Doctor Who to Angel.

The first step was from Doctor Who to Red Dwarf. Ok, so naturally I went through the list of actors who have been on Red Dwarf, and see how many overlap with Doctor Who. I found 3, one of which the actor isn't planned to be on the show until 7th season, and none of them are the same characters they played while on Red Dwarf. In case you're curious, the actors who have played in both series are [Mark Williams](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0931247/), [Jon Glover](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0323140/), and [Johnny ~~Bravo~~ Barrs](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1267673/).

What I did find, though, was that there was an episode in which the TARDIS/a blue police box could be seen in the background. Ok, so we're already off to a rocky start, here. There isn't any actual character crossovers, but a blue police box can be seen in an episode, which is kind of shaky to me. Without any actual confirmation, this could be just a regular phone box just as much as it could be the TARDIS. And while we all like to call the TARDIS 'Sexy', let's be real here, I don't think we'd consider it a tangible character along the lines of Sarah Jane Smith or The Doctor. In other words, I feel like it's a stretch of the word 'Character' within the context of this multiverse theory.

Ok, so that aside, let's move to the Red Dwarf-Angel connection. I'll cut to the chase, the only connection I could find was that the actor who plays The Cat in the **American** version also has a part on Angel, but is not the same character.

Further reading lead me to a Buffy reference(Which is indisputably in the same universe as Angel, as Angel is a spin off of Buffy)in which a character makes mention of having seen every single Red Dwarf episode. And that's the closest I could find connecting the two, is a character confirming that Red Dwarf is a fictional world within the context of the Buffy universe(Which, again, includes Angel).

And, with all that said, I'll give my own personal two cents. Characters can be a part of one universe, without that universe being a part of the character's original universe. For example, one could argue that The Doctor is in the Futurama universe(As we've not only seen him, but we've even seen him use the TARDIS). However, this does not mean that Futurama exists within the the Doctor Who universe. This is doubled by the fact that there's never been anything in Doctor Who to suggest that the characters of Futurama exist within its universe, despite Futurama suggesting that Doctor Who characters have existed within its universe.

In other words, it's possible to have crossovers without actual crossover of the universes. One universe just happens to have the same character as another series residing within it, completely disconnected from the character's original universe.

Honestly, I think this is why we don't see an actual list of crossover characters.

I mean, I don't mind the concept, but the execution is just flawed for two reasons, and the both involve not being straight forward with the audience.

1)As you made mention, there's no official list of how each show connects to another. Personally, a lot of what would make this interesting is getting to actually see how the author connects something like Doctor Who all the way to 1960's Batman.

2)He's not straight forward with the fact that he doesn't even fit his own criteria.

I'm surprised you didn't like DW and the Pirates- I'm not a pirate fan and the first couple parts of storytelling are kind of painful, but then finding out Evelyn's real reason for the story puts the whole thing in a different light. Shada is a strange one...it's all right. I loved Davros and Legend of the Cybermen as well- you know Legend is part of a trilogy with Jamie McCrimmon and 6 (City of Spires, Wreck of the Titan, Legend of the Cybermen)?

I'm surprised though- you liked the Davros Mission? Why so?

Twin Dilemma and the Two Doctors aren't exactly the best stories for 6 on screen- I'd recommend Vengeance on Varos as his very best. As for your dramas- you're really bouncing around there like crazy. Though, if you're cherry picking, you're missing some of the best. You definitely need to hear the other two dramas that go with the villain trilogy- Omega and Master, to accompany Davros.

Then Holy Terror, Scherzo (8th Doctor, part of an arc but you can jump in on this one safely), Embrace the Darkness, Flip-Flop is awesome for it's wibbly wobbly. Jubilee is great for Daleks (the original version of the tv story *Dalek*), then The Juggernauts for more Davros goodness, Loups-Garoux is a good story too, the Natural History of Fear will blow your mind out of the water if you like the type of stories that lead you on. This one does that to the farthest degree, and the very end of the drama has a reveal that shocks you. Spare Parts is a great story- Cybermen origins ftw. If you're specifically a Davros fan I'd also say Terror Firma- it gives you a lot to think about and it's sure got some powerful acting with 8 and Molloy- not sure how I feel about it emotionally.

Manager: Roberto Di Matteo (He deserves at least a one-year trial)

Medic: Eva Cameiro **CAUSE SHES HOT**

Reasons: 

* I picked **Sturridge** over **Ramires** in that position because i feel he delivers a better attacking presence in that position but limited defensive cover. But **Ramires** offers both in the position with his ridiculous energy, and hes a better player than **Mikel** and **Meireles**. And well Lampard, is Lampard what else can I say? If he does tire we've got **Essien**, **Mikel**, **Meireles** and **Oriol Romeu**. But Lampard has got to be the main man again, despite his age. Also if reports are true and if **Hulk** is 90% away from completing the deal then it would easily be a straight swap with **Sturridge**. **Ramires** keeps his position. Because everyone likes **Ramires** and he will accomodate more just because they are both brazilian. Well **Ashley Cole**, best left-back in the world. **John Terry**, our inspirational captain, a no brainer. This was a hard one but I picked **Luiz** over **Cahill** just because he's got more pace and can accomodate the other Brazilians in team. It was a flip of a coin really.Well **Ivanovic**...last but not least the big ass Serbian is a sure right-back in my team (unless reports are true that we are getting Van Der Wiel, then I'll be a hard choice).

Lets follow this logically:

It is root's opinion that a white person attacking a black person = hate crime but the reverse isn't true. His evidence for this is to bring up several cases. None of the cases he cited were prosecuted as hate crimes.

First he describes the Stephen Lawrence case. This case happened *before* hate crime legislation came into force in the UK, so not only is it irrelevant, the case had an **impartial witness** who heard the racial abuse...in other words if it was tried today as a crime carried out after hate crime laws were written, yes it *would* be tried as a hate crime.

Next, an assault where the only witness to the racial abuse was the victim. This is not good enough evidence. Nothing to do with bias or unfairness, our courts *can't* just take the victims word for it! I can't stress that enough. The fact that it seems to be some sort of conventional wisdom in here that minorities and rape victims walk into a court, say ""yep, that's the one"" and get the conviction they're after by simply uttering evidence into being is just frightening.

Lastly, a case where not even the victims claimed racial motive. They confronted a bloody gang!

I like *The Davros Mission* and other stories revolving around Davros, the Daleks and/or Skaro because of the richness of the origins of Doctor Who's most iconic villains, the Daleks.  I think Davros is a pretty cool guy. Eh creates Daelks, exterminates teh lessar races and doesnt afraid of anything.  I find the history of Skaro very intriguing in whatever stories it appears, e.g., *Genesis of the Daleks*, *Dr. Who and the Daleks*, *The Stolen Earth* / *Journey's End*, et c.  

IIRC, *The Davros Mission* was more of a bridge that served as the story which [Classic Who ""spoiler""](/s ""crowned Davros Emperor of the Daleks in between *Revelation* and *Remembrance*"").

* Maths/Chemistry/Physics/Engineering/CompSci at Bristol, Glasgow, Nottingham, Manchester, etc

There are obviously exceptions to this (law firms go to Bristol, for example, but not enough top firms recruit enough people from there for me to say its worthwhile) and there are many niche courses at outlier universities that have special relationships etc that will mean their prospects differ from the general reputation of the uni. But in general, I think its better to get three years of experience and some on the job qualifications than a marketing/fashion/photography/journalism degree from a University that unfortunately does not enjoy a great relationship with graduate recruiters.

*Some collected thoughts I have about graduate prospects:*

The sort of jobs open to humanities/arts graduates will be filled by graduates from top universities, and even then there's not nearly enough to go around.

The big 4 are the biggest graduate recruiters in the country if you're being pragmatic and want to start off your professional career with a decent brand name on the CV (and they'll pay for your ACA or other professional qualifications, which is a massive boost). 

I know someone who did business at Portsmouth who now works for Google, and pretty much everybody knows somebody who achieved a similar thing, but these people are the exception, not the rule: looking at a graduate cohort at a major bank or magic circle law firm, for example, and its going to be Oxbridge, UCL, LSE, Imperial, Warwick, and a couple of exceptional candidates from elsewhere.

Obviously, you can tell my answer is skewed towards getting a job at large employers who take in lots of graduates every year, but this is just the best way to play the game and gain well-paid employment at 21. This is **definitely** not the best choice for everyone!

Also it doesn't account for age, it mentions under 16s etc and some demographic reference, but a woman who has an abortion aged 18, then goes on to get married, have kids, career husband etc and then finds herself with an unwanted pregnancy again at say 30, would show up in the statistics as having 'repeat' abortions.

The number of combinations of this are too high anyways. What if you meet a Russian who speaks French, but you speak German? If you want a language to communicate with lots of people, choose English.

When AVB was at the helm and he was playing Danny he said:

“Daniel offers a few of the characteristics I had with Hulk when I was with him in Porto... He is an extremely quick player, and he has technique at pace.""

Because of that he played Sturridge on the wing. The conflict ends up being that Sturridge sees himself more as a striker than a winger - which is fine, but we didn't need him as a striker we needed him as a winger. Now we've bought two new wingers, Hazard and if this works out, Hulk. Not only are they both highly rated and regarded and effectively filling his spot, but one is younger than Daniel and the other only older by 3 years.

His strength is using pace on the wing, and while he played well getting back in CL, sitting behind our attackers at CDM, which we need, isn't his game (at least that's how his game has come together for CFC).

In such situations, I don't see why a school should be forced to provide Welsh lessons when, chances are, the teacher will hardly know more than the students. 

In the long run, though, yes, I do believe Welsh should be compulsory up to key stage 3 if the staff can be found to teach it to a suitably high standard.

Culture is hearing the latest trendy music through the overly-loud Beats By Dre headphones the passenger next to you on the commuter bus is wearing.

Culture is a frame of pool down the local club, and the unspoken rules that go along with it.

All these things are British (except the Ikea one), and have regional variances. If you can think of *Welsh* things like this, then that's great, but the language will account for very little 'culture'.

It looks like this sort of attitude was phased out about 50 years later, but the way I'm reading it is that Welsh-speaking was intentionally suppressed by the English for a couple of generations of school kids.

I'm not sure if she intended to start an argument with Davis (or if so, *why him?*), but it seems like mandating Welsh as compulsory in schools there might be some reparations for this historical suppression of the language.

Even walking briskly is as near as matters pointless as far as burning off calories and simply dieting will improve you metabolism.

true,the_nell_87,uk,Scot in London,"I want to address the general comments seen in this thread which essentially come to the general conclusion that ""you're fat, it's all entirely your fault, so get over it"".

Obesity is a large problem (no pun intended) in this country, but vilifying overweight people is absolutely the wrong approach. I agree that people who just shrug off their weight and blame factors like ""genetics"" which they have no control over are a problem - but there is some measure of truth to it. Some people can eat whatever the heck they want, and remain a beanpole. A very good friend of mine is a prime example of that. Others can eat a fairly average diet, and gain weight. 

I myself put on a lot of weight between the ages of around 17 and 24, which I would ascribe mostly to the ""yay, I'm an independent adult, I can buy and eat and do whatever I want"" factor. I'm not trying to put the blame on anyone but myself, but I feel there are a lot of larger issues at play, which many people don't generally consider when talking about the obesity problem.

If we ignore the people who can eat whatever they want and stay skinny, then for most people - eating unhealthy food which helps you gain weight is tastier and more appealing than eating healthy food. I will address the general issue of ""fat tax"", and what actually constitutes ""unhealthy food"" a bit later on, but in general, Britain has a problem that unhealthy foods are incredibly tasty, well advertised, and often very cheap. Just look at the deals many pizza takeaway places do, and you'll see what I mean. In most supermarkets, you'll see sweets and chocolates and fizzy drinks and pizzas and other big selling items on sale, and given prominent displays at the end of aisles. But you never see the healthy option given these prominent displays and good sale deals.

Another big factor in the obesity problem is that of laziness. I use the word to mean many different things, but it is probably the biggest factor in why I gained weight, and did nothing to rectify it for several years. I believe that people in general are inherently lazy. We generally don't want to put in a lot of effort unless we get something worthwhile out of it. Now the most literal meaning of lazy, that of being inactive, is definitely important. But it's such an obvious factor that I won't go into any detail about it. What I'm really getting at about laziness is the ""but losing weight is so much hard work!"" factor. I'll go into dieting in more detail shortly, but in general, dieting and actively losing weight once you've put it on is incredibly hard work. And for many overweight people, it seems like an insurmountable obstacle. It's FAR easier to take the attitude of ""losing weight is really hard work and I will hate every minute of it, so I won't bother"". And I know that from experience.

Another factor would be that of educating people about WHY being overweight is bad. I think people generally know about the heart problems, and other similar health problems that arise from being overweight. But I think for many people there's an attitude of ""it won't happen to me"", and they just ignore these issues until it's too late. I think there are a lot of parallels with smoking. People know it's bad for you, and that it will definitely shave years off your life - but that problem's decades away, so why bother?

Perhaps the biggest issue is people's attitudes to dieting and nutrition. There is a huge amount of misinformation and false assumptions throughout our society about what foods are good for weight loss, what foods are healthy, and what foods cause weight gain. It wasn't until relatively recently, when I was investigating diets after committing to losing weight that I really started to learn properly what's going on with nutrition.  
The number one poor assumption that society has about weight and nutrition is that fatty foods cause you to gain weight, that eating foods with fat is bad, and that low fat or fat free versions of foods are healthier. That's a complete fallacy. Yes, fat is quite calorie-rich, but it has the huge advantage of making you feel satiated.  
The real enemy for weight loss are carbohydrates. Starchy and sugary foods are plentiful, and almost ubiquitous. Carbohydrates are essentially pure energy to the body. There is almost no overhead - it just goes straight to producing energy, while not making you feel particularly full.  
I'm currently following a ketogenic diet, with great success. Virtually eliminating carbohydrates from what I consume has been a huge eye opener. The food I consume focuses heavily on foods like meat, eggs and cheese. I don't eat breakfast every day, but when I do, it's 2 rashers of bacon and an egg from the office cafeteria. I fry most of my food in butter, and I make good use of full fat mayonnaise. I am ENJOYING what I eat, and I'm losing weight rapidly, and this is the biggest problem with the overweight issue in Britain.  
Before I had committed to losing weight, my general attitude to dieting was ""But dieting is hard! The healthy stuff you have to eat is tasteless, and I'd be miserable and hungry all the time!"" But as it turns out, that's not true at all. Losing weight CAN be enjoyable. You don't need to sacrifice everything you love eating in order to do it. Yet not enough people know that. And this lack of knowledge and education on the issue leads to the vast majority of people just assuming ""eating fatty foods makes you fat"". Even supermarkets are in on it. If you look at the food in (I think) Sainsbury, they have that wheel on the front showing nutritional information, coloured to whether that's good or bad. Yet the foods I am eating to stay healthy and lose weight show the fat content in RED, and the foods I need to stay away from at all costs show the Carb content in green. This is exactly why the idea of a ""fat tax"" is a terrible idea. It would be based on completely false assumptions, and do more to hinder than to help.

Well, this has been a bit of a rant, but hopefully I've given a few people something to think about. I don't know what the solution is to ""Britain's too fat"". I reckon there needs to be huge societal change, and no single action, legislative, scientific or even media-related could do enough to make any real change. I just wanted to make a few people realise that the issue is much, much bigger than ""lol you're fat because you eat too much. Go jog it off, fatty.""",0,1338385496,null,0,false,0,c4u2fq5,t3_ubun9,t1_c4u2fq5,t3_ubun9,null,1429029963,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

I see what you're saying now. I travel to Wales quite a bit, I'd love to learn Welsh just to surprise people. You have those similar sounds and such.

I know plenty of people who speak fluently in other languages and others who are always trying to speak the local language if they go other places, even if they aren't that great at learning languages.

Eating more healthily is always a good recommendation, especially foods that fill you up but aren't full of calories, but the history of dieting indicates that it's not very effective for losing weight long term.  You tend to get into a cyclical weight loss weight gain pattern, especially from the many unhealthy fad diets which are over-sold.  For one thing, the body reacts to starvation diets in the way it stores food intake.

You're right that brisk walking isn't a huge burner of calories, and aerobic exercise doesn't shift large amounts of excess weight in the short term.  What it does do though, when you do it regularly, is improves your metabolism, _not only for the 20-40 minute period you're exercising but generally_.  If you combine it with resistance training (as you should), the increased muscle/fat ratio may initially mean that you actually put on weight, because muscle weighs more than fat, but it also means that your muscle bulk will always be burning off calories, around the clock, even while you sleep.  Dieting will also improve your metabolism because it changes this ratio, but it's a much slower method.",0,1338386132,null,0,false,0,c4u2jg0,t3_ubun9,t1_c4u2jg0,t1_c4u2b9l,null,1429030001,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.

I came on here specifically to say NOT Co-op if you don't care about their ethics.

Granted, I pay money in through the Post Office (no local banking), but here is a run down of my paying-money in experience.

I business-bank (their normal banking may be better) so efficient banking is rather important.

- When setting up my account, they ask which Post Office is closest, so you can put money in. First time I paid in, they hadn't 'registered' the Post Office. I had to phone up, then wait three weeks before trying again.

- Also, none of my direct debits were transferred, some of the paperwork I had to send off twice and setting up the account was, basically, a complete pain.

- When I tried paying in again, I paid in cash (like every time). It took over a week for the money to go in. It's supposed to go in the same day.

- Next time paying in, the money never made it to my account. £210 simply never appeared. I phoned them up after a week, told them about it. They asked and I told them I had a receipt. They logged it and said they'd call back. Four days later I called them again. No progress, they were working on it. A week later I called back. Still nothing. Just over a month after putting the money in, they said that actually they needed a scan of the receipt (something they hadn't mentioned) before they could do anything at all. It should have been send as soon as the complaint was made - receiving the scan, it could still be another couple of weeks before getting the money. I sent a scan (with a sharp email) and, thankfully, got the money the next day.

- Last time paying money in, my card was declined (I scan it before paying money in). I call the Co-op, they don't know what's up. Have no idea that I'd ever need to use my card. Tell me to unlock the pin and try a purchase. I do both. Works fine. Still won't work at the Post Office (the purchase was done at the Post Office, so it's not their machines). I call again. Person says business banking never needs to scan the card (despite doing it before and that being what PO staff tell me to do) and to try again with just a paying-in slip. I try that tomorrow.



Long rant!!!! Short: every time I've paid in money it's been either a week late, it's vanished completely or my card has been refused. Among other things.

But I still bank with them because they're supposed to be 'nicer' than other banks.

Edit:

Also, I had to phone them up to do my online banking system for me, as moving money from one of my accounts to the other just wouldn't work (they had a function on the website for it, but it would say 'done' without having *done* anything).

A lot of these managers have a good first season, as no one knows what to expect from there teams, and the opposition under estimates them, so they get more points than they would have expected.

However, I think you are under valuing the effect of verbal abuse.  Having people shout abuse at you when you are feeling emotionally low can easily tip people over the edge.  What happens if one of the people she was abusing went home and committed suicide afterwards? Worst case scenario but a scenario nonetheless. Having been a victim of verbal abuse growing up (having ginger hair and being a geek in high school is not a good combination for growing up in South London) I know how hurtful and horrible it can be. 


As for the other people replying, I agree that if they were shouting discriminative remarks then they should have at least had a warning. But she instigated the abuse, she should deal with the punishment for it. Racism is illegal.  She broke the law. 


As for the month in jail, I think perhaps community service would have been a better punishment. Especially community service in an ethnic minority or socially depraved area would have been a better idea.

A few points I dont personally agree with in this article is, his apparent use of a 3-4-3 system, as every time I have seen them play they play a 4-5-1 sort of like a poor man's Spurs, which makes me think this writer is over playing Rodgers ability tactically, by creating something that to me isnt there at all. As his wing backs are Taylor and Rangel, and neither to my knowledge bomb up the wings more than any other player in there position.

There is a point about a risk others that have taken, but this only argues the success stories, not the many more occassions where it has fell flat on its face, yes maybe Klopp and Benitez have come from obscurity to win big with smaller big clubs, but can you name any others, I know thats why its called a risk.

I do like the argument that he gets the best out of lazy players though, as that is something that really needs to happen if he is going to get this squad in anyway close to the Champs League, there a number of players who are very inconsistent in this squad who do have the skill set to be very good players, the likes of Carroll, Downing, Glen Johnson, who we all seen be unplayable on there day, but not often enough.

Discriminating against people in a manner that actually causes them physical or economic harm, sure. physical harm should be a criminal crime, and economic harm would be a civil crime, but this lady didn't do either of those things. she was just mean, and she got thrown in jail for being mean. how is that justifiable?

The Germans would disagree with you. There are all kinds of things that meant different things in the past, but when you look at a black swastika in a circle of white surrounded by red, you don't think of the Hindi symbol of peace, you think of Nazis. but imagine there was a symbol that meant nothing but hate versus, say, black people. a shirt that says ""I hate niggers"" or some such.

I agree its probably the best idea of the lot and once I can get past that mental block I most likely will do. I reckon like you that losing weight would help the old back and its a bastard of a catch 22 situation to be in.

I did actually go to the gym a couple of times a week for several months and got quite a lot of upper body built. They also had some exercise bikes where you sat about the same level as the wheel which I used as well. Unfortunately I think I pushed it too far because it went to crap big style. The problem is you actually gain weight which many people don't realise. A lot of the muscle groups in my torso were basically atrophied. Muscle is more dense than fat so starting from the point I was, as you lose the fat and increase muscle mass your weight actually goes up, not down. Although my body shape changed a lot for the better, I gained over a stone. Unfortunately I don't think the trunk muscles strengthened at a sufficient rate to compensate for the extra loading. With hindsight, I think if I were doing it again I would change the order in which I work on the various muscle groups. Kind of has a problem that it takes longer to build up the trunk muscles if you're concentrating on those as you can't really improve cardio without increasing muscle mass on the upper body and unless you improve your cardio, you can't increase the length of time you can exercise.

Trouble is its a big mental block. As you would expect, when I was a squaddie I'd rip the piss out of fat people. I am now one of those people so I think others see me as I used to see people who are as I am now.

Definitely NOT June though. 

Apparently, August there will be a preview.

But the show starts in Autumn, which is pretty vague. There's only 5 episodes before the christmass special.

So, if we count back from that, assuming 1 episode per week, it would mean it would start on 20th of November. UNLESS, they don't air on the day that Christmas falls (which is a tuesday so seems likely). 

Now, I doubt they'd want to squeeze it to close to each other, so let's assume they air on saturdays instead. Leaving the Saturday before the christmas special blank, the show would start at 10th of November.

Of course, if there are things that would interrupt it or get in the way, then we have to assume it starts earlier to compensate for that. 

Now, if they release one episode every 2 weeks...then 6th October would be the start (barring anything getting in the way)


Of course, all this is speculation that they want to tie the episodes and the christmas special together.

There might be a wide gap between the two...

&gt;Even after having read and listened to half-a-dozen explanations of the alleged ""sex crimes"" that resulted in an international manhunt for Julian Assange, we're still confused about what he's being accused of.

There is no manhunt from the prosecutors side. The prosecutor has been extremely passive.

&gt;First it was rape. Then it was molestation. Now, it seems, it's rape again, except that everyone agrees the sex was consensual, which seems to undermine an essential premise of rape.

It was always molestation (two cases of it) and unlawful coercion. At first there was also an accusation of rape. That was dropped for a couple fo days at the very beginning. It was then immediately reinstated. There is no argeement on the rape being consensual, at least not throughout the entire act. The main point is that the woman wans't fully awake when Assange initiated the act. I think Assange has admitted this, but I'm not sure.

&gt;And then there's this bit about the broken condom and the women who, after the fact, wanted the promiscuous and footloose Assange tested for sexually transmitted diseases.

They both wanted him tested. That was what started the investigation. At least one of them had explicitly demanded that Assange wore a condome (he does seem to sleep around when given the oportunity, wouldn't you agree?), which he did not. The whole ""broken condom"" history is pure missleading from Assanges defence team. It was never the case, but it was widely reported because it sounds funny. The same thing with there being a crime called ""sex by surprise"".

true,djangogol,present,Drogba,"This one is admittedly far-out but I think we should try for a more dynamic shape in aid of attacking football. I figured with all this attacking talent we could try a false 9 scenario with no out-and-out striker a la Barca or Man U a few season back. Therefore Mata would play as a false 9 and Torres or Hulk would be allowed to roam the way Fergie did with Cronaldo a few seasons ago.

In my ideal system we would also convert Luiz into a defensive midfielder to take advantage of his natural desire to go forward from time to time.

As with Cole, so with Terry. Both are exceptional players but at this stage in their careers, there needs to be a 'real' understudy to each who actually plays in the various games from time to time; say 30% of games. In Lampards case, its the opposite, Obi would be the main player who is substituted in the role by Lampard from time to time. 

Finally, in keeping with the desire to attack, control of the midfield would necessitate more players there and one less in defense.

Note, I am a believer in: 

1. squad rotation so in my system almost every player would be rotated every few games.

2. Youth talent - Piazon would be at least on the bench every few games.

Without further ado, I give you my 3-2-5 system

true,[deleted],null,null,"I reckon like you that losing weight would help the old back and its a bastard of a catch 22 situation to be in.

I did actually go to the gym a couple of times a week for several months and got quite a lot of upper body built. They also had some exercise bikes where you sat about the same level as the wheel which I used as well. Unfortunately I think I pushed it too far because it went to crap big style. The problem is you actually gain weight which many people don't realise. A lot of the muscle groups in my torso were basically atrophied. Muscle is more dense than fat so starting from the point I was, as you lose the fat and increase muscle mass your weight actually goes up, not down. Although my body shape changed a lot for the better, I gained over a stone. Unfortunately I don't think the trunk muscles strengthened at a sufficient rate to compensate for the extra loading. With hindsight, I think if I were doing it again I would change the order in which I work on the various muscle groups. Kind of has a problem that it takes longer to build up the trunk muscles if you're concentrating on those as you can't really improve cardio without increasing muscle mass on the upper body and unless you improve your cardio, you can't increase the length of time you can exercise.

true,Ajzzz,null,null,"&gt; Okay. People speak Welsh, and Welsh should be more widely spoken in Wales. It's a great language. When a language dies, you lose a way of looking at the world, you lose the songs, the history, completely lose the culture.

Not my culture or the culture of many people in Wales. English-speaking Wales already has a culture, and if any of them voluntarily want to learn a language with under 500,000 native speakers (the vast majority speak excellent English) that's great. Forcing it on people is just as bad as forcing people to not speak it. For most people in Wales, English is their language, Welsh is not their language, not their local language, and a waste of time.

More than France speaks French and only around 36% speak English in France, and not all of them would speak it as well as some of the Welsh could speak French. Being a romance language, it should help with learning Spanish. English is a west germanic language like German, but that should make it easier to learn, it allows you to communicate with millions of Germans you wouldn't be able to otherwise.

...No. *You're* still confused (as well as the blogger you linked to). The European Arrest warrant, on the other hand, is not confused, and has the same four offences on it today that it did two years ago when it was issued.

They are:

&gt; 1. Unlawful coercion - On 13-14 August 2010, in the home of the injured party [AA] in Stockholm, Assange, by using violence, forced the injured party to endure his restricting her freedom of movement. The violence consisted in a firm hold of the injured party's arms and a forceful spreading of her legs whilst lying on top of her and with his body weight preventing her from moving or shifting.

&gt; 2. Sexual molestation -On 13-14 August 2010, in the home of the injured party [AA] in Stockholm, Assange deliberately molested the injured party by acting in a manner designed to violate her sexual integrity. Assange, who was aware that it was the expressed wish of the injured party and a prerequisite of sexual intercourse that a condom be used, consummated unprotected sexual intercourse with her without her knowledge.

&gt; 3. Sexual molestation - On 18 August 2010 or on any of the days before or after that date, in the home of the injured party [AA] in Stockholm, Assange deliberately molested the injured party by acting in a manner designed to violate her sexual integrity i.e. lying next to her and pressing his naked, erect penis to her body.

&gt; 4. Rape - On 17 August 2010, in the home of the injured party [SW] in Enköping, Assange deliberately consummated sexual intercourse with her by improperly exploiting that she, due to sleep, was in a helpless state. It is an aggravating circumstance that Assange, who was aware that it was the expressed wish of the injured party and a prerequisite of sexual intercourse that a condom be used, still consummated unprotected sexual intercourse with her. The sexual act was designed to violate the injured party's sexual integrity.

Note in particular that the rape charge was in respect of SW; which is not the same woman as the one who the condom broke (or, as the prosecutor alleges, was broken) with.

We'd be lucky to find a buyer for him but I'd let him go for a greatly reduced fee just to get him off the wage bill. As I've said before, I no longer have faith in him to improve. With him gone, along with Didier, Kalou and Bosingwa, we would free up around £400k a week in wages. Considering their contribution (Didier aside obviously) this is a good bit of business for us. I think Meireles will be difficult to move on, but he could do a job and he's the right side of 30 so his departure isn't high on my priority list

Assuming Hulk arrives, Lukaku would most likely go on loan to an English team, Everton being my preference, to gain experience and match time. I genuinely think we'll have trouble keeping Sturridge, he wants to play central but he goes about it the wrong way. Looking pissed off, hogging the ball and his bad attitude/drop in form was potent enough to keep him out of the England squad. He can be more trouble than he's worth. On those two assumptions, we'd have Torres and no dedicated alternative. Hulk has been brought in to play the wider role, moving central as tactics dictate, I don't think he's been brought in as a striker

Falcao or Cavani would fit the system, and there's enough games for them to alternate with Torres without annoying either of them

The RB situation does need addressing, a pacy RB who can get behind the opposition would work wonders with the wider system we'll be employing. I think with the options available, £10-15m would be more than enough. As bad as it sounds, for Chelsea this is a pretty insignificant expenditure and shouldn't affect any plans for other signings

I love Luka, I genuinely think he will be the final piece in the jigsaw and can make the difference between a good season and a great season.

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"[This](http://www.theliverpoolword.com/2012/05/brendan-rodgers-why-he-makes-sense-as-the-next-liverpool-manager/) article has been linked around on this subreddit a bit in the past few days, and sums up why he might do well for Liverpool. Also, [this](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/may/11/brendan-rodgers-swansea-city) Guardian interview does a good job of summarising his influences, philosophy, training methods etc. What do I think? I agree with the majority of that first link, so instead of repeating I'll add some new points both for and against him. 

**For:** I expect him to be better in the transfer market than Dalglish/Comolli, and his tactical system makes the whole better than the sum of the parts.

He took a Swansea team with the [second lowest market value in the Premier League](http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/en/premier-league/startseite/wettbewerb_GB1.html) to 11th. In contrast, we had the 5th highest market value and ended up 8th. 

Obviously market value isn't a perfect indicator, but I think there's two ways a team can end up in a better league position than its market value: by buying talented players on the cheap, or through a tactical system that makes players look better than they are. 

If you do the opposite of these, you perform below your market value, and we know we overpaid for players and subsequently didn't get the most out of the players we had. On the other hand, teams like Newcastle and Swansea did these things; one thing that hasn't been mentioned much is that Rodgers has been shrewd with his transfers, unlike, say, QPR. This is also important because our new owners want us to spend within our means, and FFP is kicking in soon - so Liverpool won't be spending massive amounts in the transfer market until we're back in the CL, so we need someone like Rodgers who can spend shrewdly and also get the most out of players.

**Against:** Much of the tactical philosophy was already in place at Swansea before he took over; it remains to see whether he can implement it from the beginning. After all, he struggled at both Watford and Reading, and notably Watford had to recover from a poor start - will our fans tolerate that at Liverpool?

Also, the overperformance effect I described above diminishes the higher up the table you go; consider how much money Man City had to pump in to go from 3rd to 1st, and even then they nearly cocked it up. It remains to be seen whether Rodgers (or most other managers, for that matter) can really get 'the whole to be better than the sum of the parts' effect with more talented players.

For you or anyone else who's new to the story.

It is a strong possibility that Assange is soon to be extradited to Sweden, where apparently it will be easier for US authorities to get hold of him than it would be from the UK.

Bradley Manning, a Private in the US armed forces, has been reported to have been subjected to borderline torture (solitary confinement, possible degradation of some human rights, etc) in the US after he was arrested for allegedly leaking: [Collateral Murder](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2011/video/opensecrets/), a video showing US armed forces attacking and killing innocent journalists, photographers and civilians; and [hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables](http://www.wikileaks.org/cablegate.html), many of which reveal an unpleasant side to the foreign policies of the US Government. These were leaked via the Wikileaks website which was set up by Assange to allow whistleblowers to anonymously release incriminating material. It is believed that Manning's detainment and treatment have been in order to pressure him into implicating Assange as a partner over the release of Collateral Murder and the cables.

The broad belief is that the US Government want Assange and seek to acquire him by fair means or foul. Assange's extradition to Sweden would present an opportunity for such an acquisition.

One of President Obama's election promises in 2008 was the closure of facilities such as Guantánamo, a base infamous for the detainment and treatment of political prisoners in the US. Its closure was to be symbolic of Obama's wider vision of a more open and transparent government. At the time of writing, it remains open.

My comment was an admittedly somewhat glib observation on the scale of the forces ranged against Assange and the hypocrisy of American Government.

Also, the second sentence in my comment is a paraphrase of one of my favourite lines from Douglas Adam's *Don't Panic*, the fifth in his Hitchhiker's ""trilogy"".

Ramires does not have Lampard's passing vision nor range, and would not (and did not) work in a pairing with Mikel.

Without them there'd be no national minimum wage and no tax credits. Also the conservatives before them brought the NHS and schools to the brink of collapse. During pretty much the entire term of the Conservatives, mortgage interest rates were in double figures as the govt controlled the interest rate, raising it to pay for their financial fuck ups - The most extreme example being TWO rate rises in a SINGLE DAY and not only by 0.5% but by 2% then an additional 3% taking the mortgage interest rate which was 10% at 8am on 16/9/1992 to 15% by dinnertime all in a failed effort to stay in the ERM. That led to tens of thousands of home repossessions...the highest number in UK history.

In The Dalek Invasion of Earth, the daleks invaded earth in 2153, they ruled it for about ten years, then the first doctor comes along and kicks them out. Then in Day of the Daleks, the daleks invaded sometime around 2080, hung around for at least the next 20 years, then the doctor possibly changes history so that the second invasion didn't happen. Either that or the first invasion didn't happen.

Also, Genesis of the Daleks establishes that the very first Daleks had internal power sources, which the Daleks in ""The Daleks"" and DIOE didn't have, so these more primitive Delaks have been erased from history, probably by the Daleks from The Chase or Dalek Masterplan in their TARDIS which they must surely have nicked from the time lords during the time war as Daleks can't build TARDISes, even the new model fiat skaro have to use time corridors",0,1338399740,null,0,false,0,c4u5d06,t3_u9q6o,t1_c4u5d06,t1_c4tw7eq,null,1429031335,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Also, [this article](http://thepathismadebywalking.wordpress.com/2012/01/27/682/) sums up his tactical approach/philosophy, as do interviews [here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/may/11/brendan-rodgers-swansea-city) and [here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/swansea-city/9013702/Swansea-manager-Brendan-Rodgers-aims-to-convert-long-ball-believers.html).

But not a lot has been said about his transfer dealings yet, which is strange because he's been very shrewd with Swansea. (I'm going to copy+paste from a discussion I had [elsewhere on this subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/uc1cn/bbcs_midlands_football_reporter_pat_murphy/c4u4jk9))

Rodgers took a Swansea team with [the second lowest market value in the Premier League to 11th](http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/en/premier-league/startseite/wettbewerb_GB1.html). In contrast, we had the 5th highest market value and ended up 8th. Market value is obviously an imperfect measure of a side's quality (Soccernomics suggests wage bill is a great predictor of league position, but again I'd say we can all assume Swansea's wage bill was in the bottom 3 and Liverpool's was in the top 5 - higher than Spurs; so they still overperformed and we still underperformed).

Achieving this meant two things - getting talented players cheaply, and a tactical system that gets more out of not-so-talented players. Rodgers did a bit of both, but especially the latter (while, say, Pardew did more of the former). Obviously, this season, we did the opposite of both of these things, and with FFP kicking in and the new owners aiming for Liverpool to be self-sufficient, a manager like Rodgers is great in this sense.

true,[deleted],null,null,"On the whole I agree, but I agree with some of your points and disagree with others. I will respond in order:

- Too expensive is always a concern. Overpaying for players is bad in all circumstances. Buying Hulk does reduce our transfer budget for other players.

- Sort of agree with this one, but Falcao was way better than Hulk when they played together. Not saying that means Hulk won't be good though.

- Backup for ST is a good point, though we do seem to have the most depth of any position at winger/CAM these days.

- Totally agree. I see Ramires as a flex player going forward. I think he won't be first choice at any position, but will be second choice at all of them.

- I think the youth being referred to is more along the lines of Piazon (ready to debut) and Lukaku (already debuted though I am uncertain of him), but your point is still valid.

HOWEVER. Having said all that I think for the same price we could snatch up a superior player. I think hulk is a 20m pound player, not 30m. For 30m we could do better.

The downvotes around here are starting to grind my gears...

Light-Yagam is a self-described new and casual fan, but also a very enthusiastic one. I don't want to make assumptions here but he might not understand the intricacies of football tactics and what each player is asked to do. I can see it's wrong, we're [hopefully] not going to replace Mikel with an attacking player, but there's no need to downvote and discourage someone for a mistake.

Light-Yagami: Mikel is a defensive midfielder, we ask him to win and hold possession for us. He doesn't make a lot of offensive contributions, he will do a lot of side passes, but that's because the strengths of his game lie more on the defensive side. He does a very important job in midfield, and without him, our possession and consequently, our offense, would suffer. He's an indirectly offensive player.

true,Mr_Wolfgang_Beard,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;the punishment should be uniform regardless of the REASON for it.

You don't actually think that. Here is why I know you don't:

&gt;If I kill someone because I want their money, because I hate their race, or because i'm simply in the murderin' mood, the ultimate crime there is murder, and my motivation should have nothing to do with it. 

Self defence is a moment where you *wouldn't* want to be put down for murder though would you? The punishment shouldn't be uniform because the crime is never uniform. Each and every crime is different and should be punished accordingly. If a man loots a shop in a riot then they should go to prison. If a man loots his brother's shop in a riot so that he can move the most valuable stock to a safer location then it is a totally different crime!

By your definition somebody that randomly shoots a victim in an alley commited the same crime as somebody that researched their victim, mapped out their regular routes of travel, planned where and how to strike, and then shot them in the alley. The list of things preceding the crime are not illegal, but it is obvious that the second murderer should get different treatment from the first one.

&gt;you're adding a punishment for the THOUGHTS of someone

No we are punishing their actions. We aren't mind readers so we can't even know if an outlawed thought was being thought. But what that woman did was a disgrace to society and she should be punished.

&gt;Each and every crime is different and should be punished accordingly.

yes, but not because of the reason for the murder, unless it's for mitigation. Lessening of a sentence due to circumstances should exist, but not an INCREASE in sentencing. 

&gt;By your definition somebody that randomly shoots a victim in an alley commited the same crime as somebody that researched their victim, mapped out their regular routes of travel, planned where and how to strike, and then shot them in the alley. The list of things preceding the crime are not illegal, but it is obvious that the second murderer should get different treatment from the first one.

If I walk up to some random person intending to shoot them dead, it IS exactly the same crime as if I had spent weeks planning it. Murder in the First Degree. In most places, punishable by 20-life, and in some places with death. The fact that the person was shot because they were black should have absolutely nothing to do with it. 

&gt;No we are punishing their actions

Scenario 1: A man beats another man. not to death, but seriously injured.

Scenario 2: A man beats another man, and calls him a nigger. not to death, but seriously injured. Why does scenario 2 require a tougher sentence than scenario 1?

Or you need a reduction in supply that is if you want prices to remain that high.

There are too many designers/artists and not enough jobs to go around, a lot of the time in most industries that would simply mean a reduction in the costs (and therefor earnings of the designers etc) but the nature of prestige and the way the design industry historically operates means the normal process of supply and demand gets skewed into.

That doesnt happen as it does in other industries in design and a whole heap of other often creative industries. 

I don't know the full ins and outs admittedly and the process and certainly does involve more than at first meets the eye but I bet I could could find a smaller lesser known company/individual that would do it the commission for half the price or probably less, do it to as high a standard and be happy for the work.

Rory has never been one to emphasize money or cost, besides that one incident.  

I really expected the conversation to happen more like this:  

&gt;RORY: Hang on. What are you doing with that? (points at her ring finger)

&gt;AMY: Engagement ring! I thought you liked me wearing it.

&gt;RORY: Well, I ... (bashfully) I do. I just didn't think you would want wear it out in Rio.  

&gt;AMY: Why not? I *am* engaged to you, *idiot*. (quick kiss, and then  chases after the Doctor)   

&gt;RORY: (in stars from the kiss)  

Instead, this was the actual dialogue

&gt;RORY: Hang on. What are you doing with that? (points at her ring finger)

&gt;AMY: Engagement ring! I thought you liked me wearing it.

&gt;RORY: Amy! You could lose it! Cost...a lot of money, that!

&gt;AMY: Hm. (takes off the ring and gives it to him) Spoilsport. 

&gt;RORY: Go on. I'll catch you both up. (heads back to the TARDIS)  

More than once in the two series he's doubted whether Amy loves him, and here she was happily displaying (for anyone and no one) that she's engaged to him - and he makes her take *off* the symbol of her love and commitment to him? 
The dude didn't even hesitate to stand sentry over her for 1800 years. And he really, honestly cared about (let's guess) three month's wages? 

Maybe there's some psychological reasoning... He's so unsure about Amy's love for him, he'd rather remove the symbols of their love so as to create less hurt and disappointment when she leaves him?

true,Mr_Wolfgang_Beard,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;self defense is not murder. neither is manslaughter. the intentional killing of another person is murder, as long as it's not in self defense.

&gt;&gt;Each and every crime is different and should be punished accordingly.

&gt;yes, but not because of the reason for the murder, unless it's for mitigation. Lessening of a sentence due to circumstances should exist, but not an INCREASE in sentencing. 

No. Lets define the crime as ""Killing somebody"". Now *you* think that all crimes should be treated uniformley right? So you are in a fuck load of trouble if you have to kill somebody in self defence. So what do we do? We divide the crime of ""Killing somebody"" into different things like ""Manslaughter"" and ""Murder"" so that we can identify the similarities and differences between different crimes. ""Stealing things"" is another crime, but we have divided it into many different subsets because obviously a man who steals a box of tissues from a public toilet (petty theft) doesn't deserve the same punishment as a conman that stole £900,000 from a business (fraud).

So what we are now experiencing is a new divide in crime.

&gt;Scenario 1: A man beats another man. not to death, but seriously injured.

&gt;Scenario 2: A man beats another man, and calls him a nigger. not to death, but seriously injured. Why does scenario 2 require a tougher sentence than scenario 1?

What we as a society have decided is this: Scenario 2 is different enough from Scenario 1 to be classified as a different crime. We have decided that one crime is worse than the other. That's just how it works.

&gt;The fact that the person was shot because they were black should have absolutely nothing to do with it. 

But everything to do with a crime has to do with the crime. If I got shot becuase I was white I'd be really fucked off and I'd want to see the bastard that shot me rot in prison. If I got shot because it looked like I was about to murder an infant then I'd be ok with that - it looked like I was going to murder an infant! Of course I should be shot for that!

What *you* are worried about is the danger that somebody who commited a Crime 1 will be punished/ found guilty of Crime 2. That is a different issue. If a court is corrupt/ unjust and sentences you for a crime you did not commit then that is a miscarriage of justice.

A man that randomly beats people up is not as evil as a man that randomly beats up only asian women. To say that they are equal is wrong. One man is clearly a violent psychopath and the other is clearly a violent sexist racist pschopath. All crimes are individual and should be treated as such.

I don't know whether any will ship to the US, but if you're visiting friends you can have it sent to them, and if you're staying in a hotel you may be able to have it sent there.  Contact the hotel to find out.

Otherwise, SIM cards are sold at supermarkets, larger newsagents and pound shops, among others.  On the high street, I've only seen second hand phones at [cex](http://uk.webuy.com/), but you can buy new ones from about £20 including SIM card and £10 credit from all the network's shops, [Phones4U](http://www.phones4u.co.uk/), [Carphone Warehouse](http://www.carphonewarehouse.com/), [Argos](http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Home.htm), and larger branches of supermarkets.

* Cheese, my good god, we know how to make cheese at reasonable prices.

* Sausages, all flavours, shapes, sizes, my goodness how i miss a standard cumberland sausage.

* Bacon, Back bacon to be precise.

* Curry, as Brits we do curry exceptionally well, I cannot wait to get my Chicken Rezela from the Bombay Lounge when I'm home, it's the first thing on my list.

* Fish and Chips. (obviously

* Pubs, the range of style, food, garden, bar, alcohol, ambience, everything is so unique up and down the country and absolutely nowhere else in the world does it better.

* Cities, rich in culture, history, multiculturalism, tolerance, intolerance about intolerance, For such a tiny island the amount diversity the UK has is second to none.

* NHS, you need a doctor, you bet your ass you ll get one, you might wait a bit (still less than many other places in the world) and you can bet your ass that you ll get help. Whether its medication, advice, counseling, whatever, its there for you, in almost any modern language.

* We're on Europe's doorstep: Another bonus of not actually being in Europe, we have the luxury of being able to be on the other side of Europe in merely a few hours thanks to our incredible:

* Airports. Yup, every Airport in the world sucks, especially the busy ones, but if it wasn't for our Airports, our infrastructure wouldn't be nearly as good. You can get around so incredibly easily in the UK it makes my heart bleed, realising that in Canada you can drive for 6 hours on one road and you haven't even left the province, let alone got your nearest airport with an international flight.

* Post, you want something in America/Canada/Australia? No problem, but you gotta wait, you gotta wait for a week until it even gets close to you. In the UK, you order something amazon at 1:30, its still with you the next day.

* Supermarket's, you think we have a problem with Tesco monopolising the Country? Have you met Walmart? He is like Tesco's, bigger, douchier, corrupt(er) brother who turns up at the party, is instantly, that guy and bullies you into buying a yoyo you didn't even want. The range of quality in supermarkets in the UK is great, you really can choose where you shop, you aren't limited to the closest one, choose to go another 5 minutes out the way to get to the one you want, or even better, buy:

* Local produce, Europe does this so well but the local bakeries and butchers know how to run a shop, and local farmers markets that happen all the time year round are always worth going to see, admire them for their trade if anything.

* General intelligence, for the most part, we are an intelligent, well rounded society that knows what is happening in the world, obviously there are many that don't but from my experience, many other people in North America so incredibly sheltered from the rest of their country, let alone the world makes for some incredibly short conversations.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Bum around Europe for a month for £450, sleep on the trains wake up in a different place, meet the locals. 

I did it when I was 20 for seven weeks and it was the right thing to do. 

A ticket (www.eurail.com), a copy of rough guides Europe on a Budget (£11 on Amazon) and the European Rail Timetable June 2012 (£15 from www.thomascookpublishing.com) will leave you £200 a week. If you are smart (shop at local supermarkets, sleep on the train if possible) &amp; do not get mugged will get an experience that you will never forget, good or bad you will not forget it.

Travel light – a passport, backpack no more than three changes of clothes, check if your bankcard will work across the EU (most do these days) and do not carry a lot of money or act like a fool and you will have a great time. Copy your entire documents and keep a copy (uploading a scan to SkyDrive or drop box is also a good idea). 

Wet wipes are your friend as well as being a light sleeper and not packing all your valuables in one place, do not take anything you don’t mind loosing, you should not have any problems but occasionally it happens.  

You can find a laundry in most cities and budget hotels are easy to find (read the Europe on a Budget) given the economic problems you should always haggle (but be very polite) and you should keep within £200 a week without problems. 

I have said but I want to stress if you can get a late train from one place to a destination a few hours away so you can sleep on the train. For Oktoberfest I, along with many others, got a 1 am train that after four hours you could stumble across a platform (in god knows where) and get on a train that returned you for a 10 am start.  

With a modern cheap cell phone you can have an alarm wake you when needed (I travelled with a clockwork alarm clock 20 years ago!) trains, libraries and internet café may let you charge a phone (but ask first and check how much).  Read this about mobiles (www.moneysavingexpert.com/phones/cheap-roaming-calls) and buy a cheap one with a spare battery and a universal charger.

Let people know where you are going but do not tie yourself down to an exact timetable but check in on a regular basis (internet café and libraries are great for this if you are really paranoid put in an alert code, i.e. if your first line is ""everything is going great"" it means that you are under duress and need help, and not putting ""XXX"" at the end means it is not you), but relax and drift on the summer winds a little. 

A few days on Reddit will give you some places to go and people to meet.  

Typically southern and eastern Europe is cheaper than central or northern but a rail ticket is a great way out of any expensive place.   

This is the point I wish I were going as well.

true,KaseyB,null,null,"&gt;No. Lets define the crime as ""Killing somebody"". 

No, lets not. ""killing someone"" is not always a crime at all, and the circumstance change it. hitting someone with a car while not paying attention is vehicular manslaughter. What if someone randomly jumps in front of your car while driving and you had no reasonable way to prevent it, and yet, you still killed someone. that's not murder, it's not even a crime. 

&gt;Now you think that all crimes should be treated uniformley right? So you are in a fuck load of trouble if you have to kill somebody in self defence.

I never said that. I said I don't believe that crimes should be increased due to the motivation behind the crime. 

&gt;What we as a society have decided is this: Scenario 2 is different enough from Scenario 1 to be classified as a different crime. We have decided that one crime is worse than the other. That's just how it works.

That may be true in the UK, but here the hate is not a crime in and of itself, it is an aggravating factor which increases the sentence based upon the motivation behind the crime. I think that's wrong, and so do a lot of people out here. 

&gt;If I got shot becuase I was white I'd be really fucked off and I'd want to see the bastard that shot me rot in prison. If I got shot because it looked like I was about to murder an infant then I'd be ok with that - it looked like I was going to murder an infant! Of course I should be shot for that!

You can't possibly think that's the comparison I'm making. 

&gt;What you are worried about is the danger that somebody who commited a Crime 1 will be punished/ found guilty of Crime 2.

No, it's not. I'm worried that someone will be given a harsher punishment simply because of their personal opinion about something. If I steal from someone, and I steal from someone because they're jewish, it's the exact same crime, and should not have an extra punishment because of the motivation behind it. 

&gt;One man is clearly a violent psychopath and the other is clearly a violent sexist racist pschopath.

Its one of the downfalls of being a landlord. If you're not prepared to have it happen, don't rent out property.

**PLEASE DO NOT LISTEN TO ANY OF THE ADVICE POSTED BY OTHERS BELOW. IT COULD SEE YOU ARRESTED AND ALSO SUED.**

I strongly suggest you look at tenancy law. You can't just kick them out. You have to serve notice which needs to be done in a very specific way. It takes a few months to do it legally - by the time you've gone through the court it could easily be 6 months. Get the wording of the notice and serving wrong and it could drag out a year or more.

You first of all have to serve a Section 8. Actually, you can't - your father has to. This has to be done absolutely correctly with the correct wording in the correct legal format with reason why (Ground 8 - 8 weeks or 2 months rent arrears) or the whole thing is invalidated and you have to start all over again. 

It has to be done through court. You can't just break in and take possession without a court order or the tenant can sue you and you can also find yourself being arrested by the Police and charged with Unlawful Eviction and Harassment.

true,alister667,lfc68,,"That's a very interesting read. Assuming Rodgers carries on with his strategy as outlined in this article it'll be interesting seeing which players fit into his ideas and which ones might not.

At the back Reina is one of the best sweeper style keepers out there, he looks custom made for it. Likewise Skrtel and Agger (especially) look well suited to playing it out from the back. Johnson and Enrique likewise should be well suited to bombing up the wings in support of attacks. 

In the midfield, Lucas seems a natural, and I'd love to see Aquilani and Gerard form that central triangle. If not Aquilani maybe Henderson.

For the front 3 Suarez looks like he was made to play on the right side of this system. He's so creative he'd be a big plus. He's excellent at pressing up the pitch too. 

I'm not sure I can see Carroll and Downing fitting into this system quite so well though. It calls for quick feet, accurate passing and swift intelligent movement. Hopefully I'll be wrong about this, especially big Andy, I'd love to see him prosper.

Dirk Kuyt is a hard worker, but technically seems a little limited, so still might be on his way out, Maxi I suspect doesn't work hard enough for the high pressing up the pitch. I'm not sue how Adam would fit into this, is his control and short passing sharp enough?

This is all just speculation, of course. It'll be interesting to see what Rodgers does in the transfer market. I'd hope for another striker (or two) and an attacking inside left. Could Joe Cole play there if we don't need a hit the byline and cross style winger? Maybe he's on too much money and they might look to let him go to bring down the wage bill.

I feel like I got very little from being *forced* to learn the Gaelic language, and that it was actively detrimental to learning other languages (not to mention other time that could have been better spent on maths, physics etc), and that I could have a workable knowledge of French (or any other language) had I not had a significant portion of my time wasted on learning a language that I never intended to speak.",0,1338421341,null,0,false,0,c4uaj4e,t3_uasg2,t1_c4uaj4e,t1_c4u5z1n,null,1429033889,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,ax4of9,null,null,"My whole point is that unless you're Italian, or your name is Mourinho, hiring a successful manager isn't actually as good as it seems, at least not in the long run. The majority of winning managers in Europe in recent seasons all came from relative obscurity over a short period of time. Frank de Boer with Ajax,  Conte with Juventus, Klopp with Dortmund, Vitor Pereira with Porto. All of them have less than 10 years of managerial experience. Even Mourinho and Mancini only have slightly more than 10 years managerial experience. 

All this talk about hiring a ""proven"" manager is fueled by the media and nothing but empty talk. It's like this idea of having to buy ""world-class"" players. Why can't you discover your own world-class players? Cavani wasn't considered a superstar when he was at Palermo, he only came into the limelight when he went to Napoli. Shinji Kagawa came direct from Cerezo Osaka and played well almost immediately for Dortmund. Hulk went to Porto from the J-league. Eden Hazard was more-or-less a Lille youth product. All this focus on buying ""world-class"" players is hype created by the media, it simply shows short-sightedness, poor youth development, and most importantly, poor scouting. 

Anyone who says that Liverpool **must** buy a ""known"" world-class player in order to compete simply shows how they have a fundamentally weak understanding of football. The Liverpool way has always been to find and create our own superstars. In fact, that's not just the Liverpool way, that's the way of most clubs who have enjoyed long-term success and longevity.

true,pbhj,null,null,"Welsh is Brythonic, like Cornish and Breton - I've not researched it much but I'm under the assumption that these are the variants that were formed as the Britons in modern day England fled the invaders (Angles, Saxons, etc.). Of course when it was formed it wasn't ""Welsh"" because Wales as a whole didn't really come in to existence until the lands that now form Wales were annexed to England.

Henry VIII introduced the Tyndale Bible apparently in an effort to standardise English against a huge variation across his counties - he apparently wished for all those in office across his domain to speak a common tongue, a laudable aim IMO. It's no surprise then that he did to the most recently acquired counties (in what we now call Wales) what he was doing in areas under more established rule of the English crown. We see this codified in the [Laws in Wales Act 1535](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Hen8/27/26/contents) in which English is made the official language of the new counties. (Such act being repealed in full in 1993). See eg [the last of these BBC clips](http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/archive/?theme_group=periods&amp;theme=tudors&amp;set=tudor_politics).

So certainly between the 16th and early 20th centuries *Cymraeg* was the historic language of people in the area we now call Wales and English a modern language of that region. Of course we're talking really of Middle Welsh (the language of the *Mabinogion*) and Middle English really at the start of this period. 

If you want to be more historically true to the language of the Welsh region then Latin apparently is the way to go, the Brythonic tongues being based on it due to the influence of the Romans. But then just as British language pushed out Roman language it too had pushed out Celtic tongues. So why accept the British tongues that usurped the Latin and Celtic but refuse to accept the English tongue that's usurped the British?

&gt;*How is Welsh historic when it is perfectly capable of describing modern life?* //

Is Latin not historic wrt being a language of the people of Wales? Same.

This, http://gwybodiadur.tripod.com/faq.htm#enginwelsh is quite good on Welsh having many borrowed words from English (which appears to have accelerated with technology related words, though I'm no expert) which suggests that Welsh has an anachronistic limitation.

&gt;*the Government does not support a standpoint saying that Welsh is more important* //

I've been in a couple of dozen Welsh primary schools (English medium ones) in which this was made quite clear, that Welsh language is pre-eminent and the ultimate aim of the schooling was to produce Welsh speakers at the expense of any other lesson - hence each lesson and all interstitial periods include Welsh language teaching; this being required [teachers inform me] by curricula set by the Assembly [though I've not read the curricula myself].",0,1338431262,null,0,false,0,c4ucp00,t3_uaq8y,t1_c4ucp00,t1_c4u91m2,null,1429034925,2,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,2

If it 4-3-3, the guy I see that should be really worried about his starting spot would be Super Frank sadly enough. Mata could play at Lamp's spot at left midfield, and Ramires can play on the right. The front three have more or less been decided if we play a 4-3-3 with Torres, Hazard and Hulk if he comes.

I wonder if a diamond formation would work now...Torres and Hulk strike partnership, Hazard right behind them, Mata and Ramires as the wide central players and Mikel at the base.

As far as transfers go, Santos is a good prospect. He's been picked up by both Barcelona and Tottenham for a reason. He has talent. Yes, he likes the nightlife. Who doesn't.

One of the best things about the festival is all the various displays of new/old/expensive/concept cars dotted around the site and you'd miss out on all of that if you were sat down in one place all day. You won't miss out on any of the action either as there is plenty of room to stand right by the track in many places. In terms of getting there, unfortunately it's pretty much in the middle of nowhere. There may be special coach/bus services from nearby Chichester if you can get there by train but if you've got access to a car then my advice would be to drive. It's easy enough to find and there's plenty of dedicated parking space laid on in nearby fields, but it's a popular event so get there early if you don't want to be stuck in traffic for an hour or two. General advice: check the website to see who/what is going to be there each day. I haven't seen the schedule for this year yet but they always have famous drivers and the days that they're there are VERY busy. If you particularly want to see them drive then prepare for big crowds, but otherwise I'd advise going another day. Everything else will still be there but you won't have to compete with so many other people to see it! Other than that, have a good look around all the displays, have a great day, and be prepared to get ripped off at the food stalls!

He has shit work ethics, and that's not something you can change overnight. 

I'm all for going after a player who has potential, and a good attitude. Good work ethics mean that a player is more likely to fulfil his potential. Getting Dos Santos means that we have to take a gamble that he will change his attitude, and then take a gamble on him fulfilling his potential. There are plenty of young players with good potential but fail to make the step up. What's the name of that United player who was released due to his attitude? 

Your plan also assumes that he will be willing to come to us with significantly lower wages and a short contract. If not, then he can simple refuse to leave and sit there collecting his wages for 4-5 years. 50k a week is about 2.5 million a year, which makes terminating his contract an expensive failure.

It's worse now, in some ways, because a) the economy is in a worse place and b) the levels of debt have climbed astronomically due to cutbacks in HE and the dumbest idea in modern British politics, that everyone should and must have a degree.

The shock on leaving the shell of uni back then was that your 2:1 Arts degree is utterly worthless. You've gone through school, got good grades, gone to university, studied away, worked shitty jobs during the summer so you wouldn't have to do shitty jobs later on in life - to find that the bit of paper at the end of it all might as well have been dispensed in a roll next to a toilet for all the worth it has.

The realization I had was that Arts degree courses were essentially finishing school for rich kids. Didn't matter what grades they got, mummy and daddy will get them the job at the PR agency or the bank or whatever. Without those connections, waste of fucking time.

After working a few years in dead-end jobs I did a 6 month IT diploma course at the local tech college, the course itself was crappy but it got my foot in the door as entry-level developer. Then it was a matter of hard work and self-learning, and some job-hopping to get more experience. I wish to god though I hadn't gone to uni, and had gone straight to the local tech college from school. I'd have saved a fortune and have been earning earlier. 

Now of course the tech college is yet another university because, well, everyone has to have a degree. Fuckwits.

My experience for what it's worth:

- cut back on non-essentials. Sell the car, for fuck's sake. I'm in my late 30s and I don't need or use a car. Unless you live in the middle of nowhere, it's a money suck, like having another house on wheels (but unlike a house, it just deprecates in value). Walk, bike and use public transport when you absolutely need to. 

- if it's an option, shelve your pride and move back with the folks. Not helpful if they live in some rural jobless wasteland however. 

- if you do live in a rural jobless wasteland, there is one thing around now that wasn't when I was a kid - the Internet. There is work you can do freelance+online (you'll need to do your own research here). Maybe not much, but anything to pad the old CV and bring in some cash. 

- It's NEVER ok to work for free (genuine charity work aside). Unpaid internships are fucking evil, period, another way for employers to scam the desperate and rich kids to get ahead of the rest of us without having our hard work and talent. NEVER, EVER accept work for less than your legal minimum wage.

Since then we've had Ballack, Mikel, Deco, Meireles and others fulfilling mostly central midfield roles. Even Ancelotti had a diamond of four central players. What is important now is the transition from the so called ""Old Guard"" to the new and developing talent. McEachran and Romeu need more experience playing and we need to learn  to cope with out Lampard and Essien. We also need to think about how to maintain positions for Mikel and the pseudo-winger/central midfield talents of Ramires.

There is plenty of accommodation for international students on central campus, near a direct bus root into town, so if you are willing to pay10/20 quid a week on travel expenses then it might be worth considering Wentworth college. 

Like I said the chances of you getting a reasonably priced and good quality flat/house share at this stage is slim. My advice would be to apply for university accommodation.If you don't get on with your house mates then you can request to be moved or talk to the porters or your provost. You can't do that in a shared house.

What part of the US are you coming from ?

I wish you all the best.

All the catered halls you've gone for there were full of very stuck up public school kids when I was there (5 years ago now, making me feel old). But that might be your crowd so possibly a good thing?
Badock and Hiatt baker were always very popular catered halls and sociable with less posh kids.

The Uncatered halls you've gone for there might end up being on the quiet side (apart from Goldney). I applied for the halls around clifton and didn't get either of my first choices, ended up in University Halls in stoke bishop and it was the best thing to ever happen to me. There is a good atmosphere from the halls there.

My advice, go to a hall in stoke bishop. It's a mission, but you'll only be there for 1 year and make the most friends/have most fun up there. You're right next to the beautiful downs, better atmosphere and there are some great halls bars. Get yourself a bike for the commute to uni and save yourself time.

I THINK there is a free bus nowadays, was introduced after my time, but email someone from the admin dept at the uni and they'll confirm that.

To me, I preferred catered over uncatered but that's a preference. I wanted to start cooking ASAP and not have to concern myself over getting up in time for breakfast/be back in time for dinner.

I've just finished my first year at Bristol, and lived in Manor Hall. However, it's being refurbished next year, so I don't think is an option for you.

In terms of catered halls, I wouldn't go for Wills Hall, as it's very expensive, and attracts a lot of very similar, stereotypical students (although it's apparently got better at being slightly more diverse recently). Also, it's so oversubscribed that it's very unlikely you'll get a place. I've only ever been in CHH once, and it seems alright, but I've never tasted the food or been in the rooms, just used the squash courts/ bar. However, it is in Clifton, which I see as being a big plus as I don't think I would have got involved in half as many societies as I have if I'd been in Stoke Bishop, seeing as it's a good 35 minutes walk to the university/ union/ gym. I've never been in Churchill, but I have been into Badock, which is apparently pretty similar. The rooms in Badock are quite small (well, compared to Manor's rooms anyway, which I'm pretty sure are the largest of all the halls), but the foods alright, and it has a good atmosphere. Stoke Bishop seems better for a student atmosphere, and meeting other people from other halls, as all the halls there are very close together. But, the Wessex bus is dreadful, as there are so many students all trying to get on one bus (if one even turns up that is), and it can be a bit of a ball-ache getting to lectures in the morning. At Badock, tea is at 5.30-7, which seems very early to me, but I'm sure you get used to it. The brunch on Saturday morning is also a lifesaver. There is only a microwave (and no freezer) in the kitchens there, which limits what you can eat when there isn't food cook for you (i.e. lunch and, I think, Sundays)

In terms of self-catered, Goldney is very expensive (I think this year it's £35 a week more than me, and the rooms are smaller, although it is more modern). The grounds are beautiful though, and they throw a good end of year party. I haven't been to the other two, so can't really comment on them. However, I really enjoy the freedom of being able to cook for myself, and it turns out a lot cheaper (I generally spend between £10-20 a week on food).

At the end of the day, it really depends on what you value most. To me, that's being able to roll out of bed 15 minutes before lectures start, and still get there on time, and being a 2 minute walk from the union (which, by the way, is a horrible building, and is avoided by most people. The bar there's cheap, but I would prefer spending a bit more money for a bit of atmosphere...). In Stoke Bishop, it is a more 'student-y' area, with many more similar people around you. Oh, also there you get the Downs, which is a huge grassy area where lots of football and other sports happen. In Clifton, there is Brandon Hill, which has an incredible view of the city, and the suspension bridge nearby, and you're much closer to clubs. Also, a bit of trivia, Stoke Bishop was founded by Quakers and because of this, there are no pubs in the area (apart from in the Halls, and they're 'members only'). I don't know if this'll affect your decision!

Hope this helps, and I'm sure you'll have a great time next year no matter where you end up - Bristol's an incredible city with so much going on that you can't really not love it.",0,1338463565,null,0,false,0,c4uhbot,t3_udnmo,t1_c4uhbot,t3_udnmo,null,1429037162,3,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,3

Either you like the music or you don't. You can certainly listen to lots of music free before committing to buying it - there is no reason why a person is not able to decide whether they want some music or not. Even accepting that there's lots of recycled crap around, there is millions of hours of perfectly good music. 

&gt; There are ways to beat piracy but it seems that nobody really wants to shut it down

What are you talking about? Beating piracy is not easy, and not even really necessary (just making it a small proportion of use would be fine). There are plenty of people that want to stop it - sadly a lot of their ideas are self defeating and punitive. Simply making music cheaper, remove a lot of the industry flab (distribution / management companies) would probably go a long way.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"Modric is an absolutely immense player, one of the best midfielders not just in the League but possibly in Europe. He's also exactly what we need. Assuming a 4-2-3-1, you have 2 central midfielders, and it would make sense to have 1 defensive minded and 1 attack minded player for some balance

Essien is not really capable of doing the job anymore, he should be shipped out at the first opportunity. Romeu is still learning, McEachran wasn't capable of breaking in to the Swansea team and he's still some way off our First XI, definitely behind Romeu in terms of development. Ramires can play this role or further forward out wide, but we'll include him for the sake of discussion. Then you have Mikel and Meireles completing the set along with Frank. Now, Lampard is 34 and cannot play every game but he is the only creative player we have in that position

One of our biggest problems this year was a total lack of creativity from midfield, nobody we have is good enough to dictate play and link the defensive and attacking phases of play. Frank is consistent but he isn't the force he once was, and his legs are going. Due to our lack of options, we ended up hoofing the ball upfield and hoping Drogba or Torres could win it, hold it up and lay off supporting players as they caught up with play, glorified route 1 football a lot of the time

You can't compare Modric to Mikel, or even Ramires. He's a different player and is essentially a Lampard replacement, he's certainly good enough. Meireles and Essien are nowhere close to that level of ability. Stats can be twisted to make anyone look good or bad, he would be a vital addition to the team and should be signed up before United or Real poach him",0,1338465252,null,0,false,0,c4uhhn3,t3_udl5o,t1_c4uhhn3,t3_udl5o,null,1429037240,9,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,9

&gt; Pirates are also the people who spend by far the most money on music and films too

There are so many problems with this: 

- correlation does not equal causality
- the selection of the group means that we are looking at a group of heavy users
- demographic issues - young people both pirate more and buy more music
- and a burglar that himself buys lots of electronics does not make it OK

&gt; How is it especially different from radio or MTV?

The 'industry' uses TV &amp; radio to promote their music - where the user can listen but not control output. The 'deal' with that is that it ultimately generates sales for people that like the music they hear. If there is no final sale then the whole thing doesn't work anymore as there is no money to create the music / reward the artists in the first place. Besides TV &amp; radio pay royalties. 

So it's very different.
