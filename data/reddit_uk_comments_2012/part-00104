true,thedingoismybaby,cnty-uk,™,"The [Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/10/contents/enacted) makes residential squatting a [criminal offence](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/10/section/144/enacted) and gives police the power to enter and remove squatters from an address.

It also creates a few new offences you may be interested in:

[Offences of threatening with article with blade or point or offensive weapon in public or on school premises](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/10/section/142/enacted) - Which carries a minimum custodial sentence for over 16s

[Offence of causing serious injury by dangerous driving](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/10/section/143/enacted) - Previously you could only be seriously charged for death by dangerous driving or the lower charge of dangerous driving. Now there is middle ground when injury is caused due to dangerous driving.

[Scrap metal dealing: increase in penalties for existing offences](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/10/section/145/enacted) and [Offence of buying scrap metal for cash etc](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/10/section/146/enacted) - Hopefully this will go some way to stopping the rise in metal thefts by limiting their options when selling

[Reasonable force for the purposes of self-defence etc](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/10/section/148/enacted) - This clarifies the law on self defence and, specifically, expands it to include defence of property and clarifies that people are not required to retreat but they should consider retreating.


Some parts of this act are [controversial](http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/video-and-audio/the-effect-of-the-legal-aid-sentencing-and-punishment-of-offenders-act-2012-on-legal-aid-for-family-cases/) due to the changes to legal aid but I think these new offences and clarifications on old offences are a good thing.

This blog is notorious for making these kinds of accusations.

Peri did not happily go along with the Doctor after he tried to strangle her and he obviously wasn't being serious about the hermit thing. He was being a general nutter. This isn't male violence against women. The Doctor didn't strangle Peri because he's a man and she's a woman. He did it because he was in post regen crisis. Granted it was a pretty bad move to have him do that (hello and goodbye audience!) but it's not sexist. Peri never idolized the Doctor. In fact she made fun of his driving and questioned his reliability a lot.

Caves of Androzani really was a good story though. I watched it once and thought ""meh"". But then I went back and watched Davison's whole run and *then* watched it, and I was like, wow that was Davison's best story. And when I say best, I mean for him as the Doctor.

One very positive side of residential squatting I have seen in the past is to help rectify council house allocation abuses. Local to me many council houses were not being used for their intended purpose (vulnerable women and children) and had been vacant for many years, the dodgy council members would keep them empty and their golf buddies would use these premises for occasional visits instead. That is until local squatters moved in after uncovering this and brought local attention to this, said councillors were removed, the houses were used for community projects (refugee projects, free clothes and food shops for the local residents etc) and they then moved on when the council had the funds to renovate and use the housing stock.

Council houses are different because of the associated belief they should be used for the community anyway.

I am wary also of the way people treat properties they are squatting in, I know you will argue this is not all squatters, and I will concede the point 100% of people are not like this, but I would imagine the vast majority of properties which are squatted in are not left in the same condition they were entered.

Back to my experience pretty much every, if not all, squatter will search for obviously empty buildings that have not been occupied for a very long time, generally if not always void of any contents so that once again it is obviously empty. After drawing up a short list of potential properties they will then landreg them and research the owners to assess the likely long term success of their occupation and how much hassle it is likely to be and then make a decision. This is what a smart, responsible person would do. I will concede many people have little respect for property, but then if your property is empty for long periods of time its likely chavs will have broken your windows, heroin addicts may inhabit it etc. Yes, many people will damage property but this is not something I could ever agree with.

Since most people have only seen newDW episodes, I was recommending within that scope. But if you're interested in Classic Who, great! Although I regret to say that I'm not an expert in that area, and someone else could tell you which classic episodes to start with.

For your better understanding, here's a list of all the episodes/series in order: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_who_episodes

For example, I spoiled myself today with the post on pictures from filming the Christmas Special. I had thought it was referring to the last Christmas Special. Thankfully I hovered to check the URL, and was only spoiled on the name of the actress - someone that I do not know by face so the damage is negligible.

If we find that the tags would interefere too much with the actual content of the thread, what if the tags are limited to season number if it is older than this season, and episode number as well as season number if it is the current season? To me that seems to be the most efficient option.

I'm very, very excited for this match. I'm sure the Anfield faithful will be in full voice tonight in support for Brendan Rodgers' first competitive home match at the helm. 

I think that tonight will be our first insight to the lovely attacking play we'll be able to see with B-Rod's Liverpool throughout the season. Although his ideals and philosophy may not have taken it's full shape yet, I think we'll see a lot of ambition and a lot of positive football/thinking. Lucas should see some heavy involvement tonight, and we as fans will most probably see him dictate the midfield in this game, having played part in four (albeit as a substitute) matches. Steven Gerrard won't be featuring for England, so I expect him to start this match in the attacking role, alongside fellow England teammate Jordan Henderson. I also believe we will see The Dark Lord get a run-out tonight!

true,Alphaiv,null,null,"Statistics like this are so pointless simply because there are so many factors that go into how many Olympic medals a country wins. Not only does a large population mean a larger pool of potential talent to draw from but there's also the limit on the number of competitors each country can send. Then you also have to consider the difference in money spent scouting and then supporting the athletes because if the overwhelming majority of your population spends their time fighting to survive then that's going to limit your chances. 

So if you try and do it on medals per capita then small countries will dominate, China would have to win over 12,000 gold medals to match Grenada's 1, the USA would need about 3000. If you try and do it per competitor then either it heavily favours countries with a large talent pool but low number of competing athletes or, once again, small countries who get a couple of fluke gold medals. Not to mention that the US could probably just enter Michael Phelps on his own and come away with 6 golds per person.

Moreover the number of golds doesn't really have any bearing on talent anyway and as you see with countries like Australia sometimes you can have a lot of very talented athletes and come away with dozens of silvers and only a few gold medals or your talented athletes excel in events that can only earn them one gold medal while other athletes can win several in swimming or gymnastics (looking at the US here).

true,Quazz,capaldi,Capaldi,"Ten was a far more complex incarnation than most before him.

He started off pretty 'bad' (christmas special 'no second chances' school reunion 'You get one chance') and then started to develop into being more nice and caring.

And then he lost Rose. He was shaken by that, the first person that had travelled with him since the Time War...and he lost her. He was still shaken throughout his travels with Martha.

All the while his bad side kept getting fed and growing. (Runaway Bride, Lazarus experiment, Family of Blood)

He could have still been pulled straight, back onto the right track by the discovery of another Timelord.

Yes, it's the Master, but the Doctor still cared for him, they used to be friends and to lose him again was as if he lost his people again. Last of the Timelords once more.

And all the while he's dealing with this emotional turmoil and grief, his companion leaves him. Utterly alone.

Very shortly after he thinks he has found a new companion! Together they save the world from getting blown up by a spacetitanic....But at a cost. She dies in the process. 

What an emotional rollercoaster so far... But wait, there's more.

He finds a new companion! Someone he had worked with before! Awesome!

Yet his dark side still grew. Refusing to attempt to save the people of Pompeii, or even a single person. Only at the last second does he give in and save one family. Then, at the Planet of the Ood he does not attempt to help the man who gets turned into an Ood. While that person may have been despicable, it's unlike the Doctor to be content with someone's suffering. 

The Doctor gets a sort of daughter though! Maybe this can pull him straight again...Oh no, he thinks she's dead and leaves because of it even though she's alive. He even blames himself for her death as seen later in the confrontation with the Daleks.

Suddenly a wild River Song appears! River Song uses Doctor's name. It's super effective! After going through all that a woman who he's never met treats him like she's known him for years and even knows his true name. What is he to think of this? Clearly this person will be really important to him one day. So of course she dies...He saved her, but couldn't save her. Another death he blames himself for. Another person who could have helped him gone.

Now there's Midnight. 10 always believed in humanity, even if he was disappointed in them from time to time...but after Midnight... His belief in them gets shaken and he becomes more isolated than ever.

Then it's dalek time. The Doctor goes to seek help from the Shadow Proclamation. When this help is GLADLY offered, he not only declines, he *runs away*. 

Luckily he gets to meet up with all his friends! Yay! AND ROSE IS BACK, HOLY SHIT. Is there hope for him yet? BAM DALEK SHOT HIM. Oh dear... But wait! Regeneration activate! Use convenient plotdevice from the beginning of Ten's run! Huray, Ten is still there with all his friends.

Then they are taken to the heart of the Dalek fleet.

They get separated and the Doctor sees his friends all turned into the very things he despises so hard...He knows their intentions are right...but still. He knows he caused this.

Then they save the day together! Yay!

You'd think they'd all stick around to catch up and keep company...but they all leave. All of them, they leave. Rose goes back to Pete's world along with 10.5 and Jackey, Mickey runs off with Martha and Jack, Sarah Jane goes home to her son, Donna gets her memory erased...

Alone again...after all that. All that struggle, all those victories, finally reunited only to be separated immediately after.

He then thinks to get a glimpse into his future! Sorely disappointed when he finds out it was a fluke. Travels alone at this point...he couldn't bare losing anyone anymore.

He starts kicking alien butt with a Lady! Awesome! But as soon as the danger is over, he leaves her...albeit helping her a tad. He gets told he will die when 'he knocks 4 times'. Oh dear...all alone and now he's being told by a psychic that he will die soon.

He travels around a bit...Arrives on Mars. Here he enters his darkest moments. He abandons everything he ever stood for. All the laws he upheld, all the things he fought against. He discarded it all to save their lives. He started to feel as if he was allowed to do anything and everything as he saw fit. A dictator, a tyrant... 

The parallels with the Master become rather clear now. He tries to avoid his death for as long as possible in any way he can. He does whatever he feels like just because he can and doesn't care about the consequences. 

He realizes he's corrupting when Adelaide kills herself...but still he runs. Tries to avoid his death.

Eventually he does show up, perhaps worried it might be pretty dangerous for the universe if he didn't. He's been alone for weeks now, if not months. 

He knows the Master has returned...and fears something more will return too. He tries to find the Master and get him to change his mind, he never wants him to die, but at the same time doesn't want Time to die either. He is conflicted and feels defeated before the battle has even begun.

Thankfully the mysterious Timelady and Wilf help him along the way. 

At this point, he was prepared to do *anything* to stop the Timelords, just like he had before. Thankfully he had several options this time around. Even so. He knows he condemns them to a faith worse than hell once more... And loses the Master again... Yet all the same, he feels as if he has conquered his past. He is relieved.

Wilf knocks four times. And suddenly the weight falls again and his mood turns grim. Survived so much, struggled so hard, only to die just to save one old life... And as he yells and rants, he realizes he is no longer who he wants to be. He has been corrupted... Lived too long. With the last bit of strength he has left he then faces the music. 

He then visits a lot of his companions. This wasn't for them, but for himself. He knew he went wrong, but perhaps not exactly how, when or why. He visited them to, not only see them one more time, but also to remember what he lost...and why.

He then starts to die and needs to regenerate. With the visits to his companions still fresh in his memory and his fear of his own corruption still strong, he then knows he will never be that incarnation ever again. It will always be different and just like before, when he used his hand, he didn't want to change, he didn't want to go, he had become like the Master, although narrower, he wanted to hold on to a specific form, rather than just life. He didn't want to go.

Sensing such overwhelming negativity from the fans and above all seeing poor season ticket sales, not to mention Warnock close to walking after Leeds failed to sign Joel Ward, Bates finally entertained takeover talks.

Now, with match and season ticket sales back where they ought to be *because* people expected Bates to be gone by this time, not to mention Warnock's cautious optimism and the positive team spirit, Bates has suddenly decided one of the following:

A. ""I can do this after all! I don't need Sheikh Rub-a-dub to come in and finish seven years of my work for me.""

Or B. ""Everything's looking so much better now, I reckon I can get more money for this club than I was previously willing to sell it for!""

true,bluefold,null,null,"The TARDIS wiki has a pretty good run down of all the sources we have about it: [http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Last_Great_Time_War](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Last_Great_Time_War) They are mainly mentions from the show (canon) or books and comics that have covered it but are not considered completely canon.

The greatest problem we have is the two theories don't really match. In the show 10 says that 'Gallifrey burned' and all that was left is rocks and dust. However in 10th doctor novel The Eyeless tells us 'Gallifrey was destroyed in a silent flash as bright as a sun' and 'Agent Provocateur' says that  The blast was so powerful the universe convulsed as planets, systems and galaxies were obliterated.' 

The demat gun is the only thing in canon that we know can remove someone from Time and Space so the latter interpretation would be the closest we have. I would hazard a guess that when 10 talks about Gallifrey burning it was possibly just before he hits it with the demat and it was how the planet was after all those years of war.

Technically the demat does not kill though. It removes something from Time and Space so as we know that the war is Time locked and you cant travel to and from it then it is possible, but unlikely, is that when we talk of Gallifrey being destroyed it is just not there. It is a very timey wimey suggestion but I belive that the Doctors name is the key to the Time Lock on the war and if he is to utter it at a certain time in a certain place then Gallifrey would go from its non-existing state (destroyed all the Time Lords 'dead') to the Time War being back along with the Time Lords and Daleks. Also time is not linear, Dalek Caan and Rasilon prove that travel out of the time lock is possible and that there are people/things still alive out there.

Just think about it, how Richard E Grant would make an AWESOME leader of a newly ressurected Time Lords who are hunting down the Doctor for kind of killing them. 

Remember the Doctor did what he did not just because the Dalek's were crazy but he also felt that the Time Lords had went so as well. They were going to destroy the entire universe and ascend to superbeings *just so they would not lose.* They did not really care about non-time lords and all they were supposed to do was observe. The Doctor is the exception not the rule.  

We see him say that 'he would know' if there was another Time Lord in existance but this is not because he is lonely but because has to so that he can keep us safe. To him they all HAVE to be dead because if they are not he has to kill them to save the world.

The most important thing you have to take away from the Time War, no matter how it actually happened, is that he killed both the Daleks and the Time Lords on purpose. That is what shapes his character going into 9 and it still haunts him as 11.

true,castlecraver,logo,,"First, take a deep breath. It'll get sorted. The new season is far more important (/s, but only sorta)

Sometimes when attempted purchases are unsuccessful for whatever reason, they still exist for a period in your account as ""pending"" transactions. It's a bit like your bank saying ""yes, the money is here and we'll set it aside until this purchase is completed,"" yet the purchase has not yet actually completed, nor will it ever be because City's system or whoever they use to do their billing didn't like something. So they're still setting it aside until either 1) the ticketing office tells the bank ""nevermind"" for the unsuccessful attempts or 2) a certain amount of time elapses without the ticketing office telling the bank ""ok, done and done, you can deliver us that money you've set aside now.""

If you've ever used your card to pay for petrol in some places you might be familiar with the concept. The petrol pumps routinely authorize your card for some pre-set amount before you ever begin pumping, and that full amount will appear (depending on how your bank displays such things) as deducted from your account until the petrol station goes back and tells them (all automatically) ""ok thanks, out of that 50 quid you're holding for us, we're only actually owed 25."" Then the charge posts to your account officially, the money you actually spent is taken out and the extra amount they ""held"" is returned.

Of course this is all done on computers and is a bit more complicated than this really, but there's handshaking going on in both directions, and usually it gets sorted out automatically. Sometimes it sorts itself out within hours, sometimes takes a couple of days for everything to work it's way through the systems.

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"__________

Our new setup works better without Mikel. The reason we needed Mikel was to provide defensive cover or when we were playing defence oriented formations. With the new system he is too slow and takes far too much time and touches on the ball to be able to combine with the likes of Ramires, Hazard, Oscar, Mata and Torres. All these players not only need quick accurate passes from the player in the defensive mid position but they need a player who can provide that pass every single time plus become a part of their rotational passing.

We are not playing the old Chelsea way, if we will be playing defensively then we will use Mikel otherwise he breaks the system. When Mikel recieves the ball he takes one touch to receive the pass, he then turns far too slowly and needs another touch to stabilize himself/prepare for the next pass, his third touch is the actual pass. When you have players who need first time balls as soon as possible you cannot play a player like this especially when you have so many options in the midfield. 
__________
This is the best formation Chelsea can use right now:

--------------Cech--------------

Ivanovic--Cahill/Luiz--Terry--Cole--

-----------Oscar/Lampard---------

--Ramires--Hazard--Mata--Marin---

--------------Torres--------------

_________
Reasons
_________ 
**Counter attacking strategy** :-

Opposing team's pass is intercepted. At this point the ball is available to the Chelsea defence and defensive midfielder (assumed Lampard). They are holding on the ball while the rest of the midfield storms forward and gets in shape. 

1) Lampard plays his favourable pass to Ramires who can storm forward but this time he is not running towards Drogba alone. Infront of him is Torres who can keep up, on the opposite flank is Marin who has also found a gap in the opposing team's defence. Alongside him is Hazard and just behind them is Mata. This is the natural shape our midfield will take during counter attacks if this pass is made. Ramires can now change flanks, pass to Torres, pass to Hazard or if he feels he is going to lose the ball he can lay it off for Mata who already was looking at everyone of his team mates infront of him and can even make the pass first time. This pace will catch out many teams who will not be prepared on the counter attack. Most Premiership teams still play with the classic old English defence which is horrible in these conditions. They can also risk playing the high line but I don't think that will be a problem because of the pace.

**Normal attacking strategy** :-

The opposing team is fully in shape. Instead of Ivanovic and Luiz lobbing long balls towards the striker, our players will play (like it or not) a version of tiki taka. Kind of like Barcelona but not to that extreme of Barcelona, yet not as bad as Arsenal does it. The players will exchange passes more than you have ever seen Chelsea do it before. Because of Chelsea's style we might be rusty at the start and even after perfection we will not be making as many passes as Barcelona. You see Barcelona players keep up the pass even if no one puts the pressure, Chelsea players will exchange a pass at the slightest moment of threat to lose possession, not just for the sake of it.

We will looking to catch out teams not via Tiki Taka but with the space the passing creates for any two players. This is not an easy way to play and certainly not the old Chelsea way but I believe that with players like Hazard, Mata and Lampard on the sheet we will still retain that crossing from the flanks in the hope of someone finishing it off. 

This is the reason Mata needs to play in the central position. This type of passing game creates room for a Mata like player to slip a ball in for a Hazard like player who likes to run at defenders. If you exchange the two then Hazard will just want to use Mata as a pinball machine while he surges forward because that is his playing style. Mata's game will be of no use just standing around and chipping balls in for his team mates running past him. He needs to be the pivot point who controls the influence of his team and can confuse the opposing defence. Hazard and Marin's full potential will be exploited when they will receive a ball with not enough defenders covering them as they will dribble past them and shoot. Keep a lookout for Chelsea's attempted shots on goal this season.
_______________

In the upcoming community shield match with Manchester City on the 12th of August you will not see much of this system but I believe this is what the team will transition into slowly. I'm glad our schedule is all packed up because these players desperately need to play together in real game conditions in order to connect.

___________

**Substitutes** :-

This is one of the strongest components in our squad this season. The ability to have players on the bench who can completely change the way the team is playing yet have the experience to instantly come on and click. We need Meireles, Sturridge, Essien etcetera if they are not starting because they can change the shape of the team in an instant. 

Chelsea still has the players to put on the big boy shoes and start defending the old Chelsea way with a couple of substitutions. We might not have that finish alongside the defending but nevertheless these players bring individual talents to the team which we can really utilize. Sturridge's weakness of not passing the ball can become useful when we need to retain possession. This is where Mikel comes in as well. He can slow down the tempo of the game which he did brilliantly as the old Chelsea squad needed it. 

 Essien can provide great defensive cover but he has the ability to link to any kind of midfield he is playing with, whether they are these new comers or the old ones. He still finds a way to fit in and adapt. Meireles who was once known to pull out of challenges at Liverpool can play that rusty hardcore game at Chelsea putting pressure on the opposing team. You will have noticed that opposing players are never settled around him because they don't know what to expect. Somedays he will take the ball from them go forward on his own and score a goal in the champions league. On other days he will tackle the shit out of them as soon as they get close until their ankles are sore enough to be substituted. Some days he will let you run by while he just looks and other times he will chase you down to the other corner of the ground just to tackle you. This ability to put opposing midfielders on the edge where they cannot read you is very important when you are playing defensively and causes mistakes from the other side.

However, it's really kind of unclear.

Also, several references have been made over the course of the new series to the Time Lords being thought of as mere legends.

The Police, Armed Forces and good old British volunteers have been great, not just for helping people attending the games but in being the public face of Britain to all the international visitors.

I feel that far too many people, not just on Reddit but in the press and in general focus far too much on the negative aspects of Britain. You could see it in the build up, people drooling over the prospect of potential failure and I'm so glad they have been proved wrong.

Suarez spent enough time attacking from the flanks anyway, why not have a big man striking option in the middle? 

Even if it isn't something that will work out, I'm struggling to find a reason why we aren't giving him a shot. The more he stays on the bench, the more other clubs assume he's not a part of the plan and his value depreciates. If we want to sell him for a solid chunk of cash, we'll need to show that he can be a success for Liverpool as well.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"I don't like to talk about players leaving but its gotten a little too far for Agger. Every player has a price. Cristiano Ronaldo has a price, it was £80 million for United. Agger has a price as well. If the management deem it to be £25 million, then it is. If its £20 million, then its £20 million. 

A lot of people keep saying Agger is irreplaceable. He is definitely one of the best defenders around, but irreplaceable? We've been replacing him close to 40% of the time for the last 3 years. His situation with his fitness means that we need a veteran backup for him almost all the time, ready to step in at the slightest twinge. We are at the stage where if we sign him to a new contract, it will be high wages and little resale value. So what happens when Coates or Kelly is ready to take over in a year or two? Do we give priority to the fit youngster and put a highly paid defender on the bench, or do we limit the youngster's experience? The difference between Agger and Skrtel is that Skrtel is almost always fit. This means that Skrtel's backup isn't of high priority, since he won't be out for extended periods. From memory, Agger missed an extended period of about 10 or so games last season. You can't throw a youngster in for 10 games during a crucial part of the season, it will be suicide. 

Don't forget, this is a season of rebuilding and experiment. Barring disastrous results, Rodgers basically has a guarantee that his job is for a minimum of two years. If the management thinks that Coates and/or Kelly have what it takes to replace Agger in the long run, then its better to give them extended runs in the first team this season. This year will be fairly stress-free, but its pretty clear that if we aren't in the champions league in 2 years, Rodgers' future will be in jeopardy. Rodgers might prefer to have a young and experienced defender playing regularly in 2 years time instead of a 29 year old defender who is very classy but missing half the time. 

In closing, transfer deals are seldom a strict yes/no game. We will probably sell if we get a great deal similar to what Milan got for Silva, but we'll also be happy to keep him if there aren't any good bids that benefit the club.",0,1344549849,null,0,false,0,c5qqkg9,t3_xyj4b,t1_c5qqkg9,t1_c5qptk0,null,1429596782,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11

Downing - A lot better, though its only against a poor team. He needs to learn to cross better with his right foot. He insists on floating the cross in, which just isnt going to bother defences, as its proving time and time again. This is why hes got no assists.

Gerrard/Borini/Suarez - Excellent. Looking forward to this link up play this season, it makes s much difference having quick thinking players working together.

Johnson - too many intercepted passes, but will come with more matches. Otherwise brilliant going forward.

Shelvey - Needs more game time, bags of potential and definitely a better option than spearing/adam

Skrtel/Agger - Brilliant as always

Reina - Might as well have been another CB, barely tested all game.


In my opinion,  Carroll is going. He didnt even get on while both adam and spearing did, so it seems quite telling to me that we dont want him tied for the qualifiers to gain more money from a deal.

Nice to see Allen in the stand, maybe Adam is going too? Seems illogical to have Gerrard/Henderson/Lucas/Allen/Shelvey/Spearing/Adam all competing for 3 slots.

If someone steals my car, they don't get legal rights to it after 28 days - it's still mine. Aside from that, there are the legal costs associated with gaining an eviction order, which can be decidedly non-trivial.

Does all that mean I don't care about the people who squat? Of course I do. There are real needs behind responsible squatting.

Right now, Carroll's description is ""player who we're open to selling because he might not be best suited to how the manager wants to play, but we'll keep him and work around it if the offers are crap."" Every minute that Carroll actually plays for us and shows that he isn't suited to the new playing style, his description goes closer to ""player who we are desperate to sell because he just doesn't suit the team and has too high wages for us to keep on the bench."" 

This wasn't a match where players needed to be taken out to be kept fresh. This was a match where many players are still adapting to the style of play and regaining match fitness. It was the better idea to keep as many players on the field for the full match as possible, to gauge how the team as a whole performs on a lower energy level. Of the 2 subs, 1 was partly sentimental and also to have fresh legs in defence to keep the clean sheet. The other was to replace a youngster who was making some rash tackles and was already on a yellow. Putting Carroll on would've been meaningless, since the rest of the team wasn't going to be on a similar energy level. They weren't in need of an alternative outlet in search of a goal, so there was absolutely no point in playing him here. 

There are those who are adamant that Carroll is suitable for Rodgers' playing style, but the manager seems to disagree, and I don't see the need to argue whether a football fan's opinion is more accurate than an entire team of professionals. Carroll will likely see more action in the friendly against Leverkusen, since a good performance will help raise his value while a bad performance can be attributed to it being a meaningless pre-season friendly.

That's the real reason why we can't even replace role models with sportspeople in the first place as I commented in the other thread last week: Basically what celeb-obsessed people want is someone they can follow constantly, read about everything they do, everyone they hook up with, fight with, break up with, etc. It's basically vapid entertainment based role models where people just want to be famous for the sake of being famous - which unfortunately is something a lot of people want.

But anyway - if you could potentially idolise these sports people without bothering them in their every day lives, you could to with anyone else regardless of what important work they have to do. You don't have to infringe on someone's life for them to be a role model, really. Eg. Bill Gates could be a role model, to put in decades of hard work with a long term goal of eradicating diseases through funding (rather than doing the research, for example) - I don't see the paparazzi following him around every day but you can still keep track of what he's doing, etc. etc.

The point as I stated below is that we should be encouraging inspiration from people who have put in effort, effort against the odds, and to make a difference, rather than people who were basically steered on a course by natural abilities, parents, and coaches.

It looks more likely that Agger will stay with us. Who knows though. Expecting Jones and Doni (is he even considered still part of the squad?) to leave as well. **Edit**:I've changed my mind. It looks like Agger is leaving. I only hope it's to Bayern or Barca.

We still need a couple strikers as well. Perhaps Quaresma (doubtful) and Mirallas (possible) will come in. Lastly, we'll get either Walcott or A Johnson. I think the first choice is Walcott because he loves the club, but only if he's willing to take lower wages (we'll see how much he actually loves the club). Johnson will be second choice and basically on loan rather than permanent transfer. Also, I've heard there might be a deal for del Piero in the works (though not completely sure about it).

Defensively I still have my doubts - just as I was about to type in the chatroom how tidy he looked, he barged into a Gomel player just outside their own area for no fucking reason.

He's a squad player, no more no less, but if he can build upon that Gomel game then he can still provide some creativity when Gerrard is injured (although it depends on other transfers before the window ends).",0,1344555019,null,0,false,0,c5qrwmu,t3_xyj4b,t1_c5qrwmu,t1_c5qpjwj,null,1429597407,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

These laws have applied to all sorts of publication for many years, some of them for over a century. The only difference now is that anybody can publish stuff now, so the law is more relevant in people's everyday lives.

It's still quite new technology. A similar panic occurred when blogs became popular, but that eventually subsided as people learnt that they couldn't libel people online and that it wasn't a massive hardship.

While the Twitter cases have been in the news a lot lately (and the US media has been very keen to exaggerate the situation, so expect further coverage on Reddit) it's important to remember that libel, harassment, copyright, data protection and trade mark cases have been heard every day in the UK for years.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"**iPlayer:** If you use iPlayer to catch-up on content, you don't need a tv licence. That's actually how I get my fix of BBC content - I use iPlayer to catch up on content after it's been broadcast. Same thing with 4OD from Channel 4. So if people in the office are doing the same? Perfectly fine and legal.

*However,* if you use iPlayer to watch live streams - then you need a licence. So If I went onto iPlayer now, and clicked the ""Watch live"" button next to BBC4? Technically that'd be breaking the law, because as someone who hasn't had a tv licence in years, I shouldn't do that.

Same applies to work environments, unless the building / company have got a licence.

**Regular TV:** The TV licence [and I'm sure someone'll come along at a less ungodly hour and correct me on this] doesn't just cover the BBC, a small percentage has, in the past, gone to the likes of Channel 4, to pay for their digital upgrade costs. But you're right - essentially the vast majority of the TV licence goes towards the BBC. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/whoweare/licencefee/]

I can understand what you're saying, but for the most part the TV licence is basically a TV Tax.¹ And much like almost any type of tax - Council Tax, Taxation on earnings etc, etc, you can't pick and choose what the money goes for - you just have to pay it.

I'd much rather my tax not be used to bomb the living shit out of countries most of us can't locate on a map, and instead be directed towards schools and the NHS, but unfortunately that's just one of those things - I work, I pay tax, and the Government decides what to ~~waste~~ spent it on.

Same thing with the TV licence.

The only way around it, is to not watch any live content [terrestrial or satellite /cable] and instead use the money to buy only the content you like. I've got a tonne of BBC content on DVD / Blu-Ray, such as Luther, The Shadow Line, Doctor Who, Sherlock etc, etc, as I support those shows.

¹Kinda crappy analogy, because as stated, you can own the device and not pay the ""tax"" by changing the way you use it.

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"&gt; We've been replacing him close to 40% of the time for the last 3 years.

[But never adequately](http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m102/ns0438a/11-12turningpoints01.jpg); after Agger was injured in the Carling Cup final and until his return, we picked up 0.5 points/game, conceding 1.67 goals/game (averaged 1.5 points per game before, conceding 0.9 goals/game); the difference is enormous.

And my issue with selling Agger is, yes he is replaceable, but are any of the players capable of replacing him available for Liverpool considering we aren't offering CL football? The fact that his sale would apparently be freeing up funds to spend on other targets as well makes it even more difficult to envisage us signing a suitable replacement for him. The other issue is, clubs will know what we got for Agger and use that to drive up the asking price on whichever player we seek to replace him; you should ideally have your replacement signed before a player exits, something we've been awful at doing for key players.

As for replacing him with Coates or Kelly and this being an experimental season, CB is generally not an area to experiment with by launching a player into the regular first-team when neither of the candidates have spent any reasonable amount of time playing for us in that position. It's still hard to say whether Coates has adapted to the Premier League, and Kelly hasn't played CB in the Premier League either. Equally, we have no suitable cover at RB beyond Kelly. Ideally, one of those two would be further along in terms of Premier League experience and the prospect of losing Agger would not be so awful, because there would be concrete signs that they are ready to step up. Unfortunately, forward planning has been missing from the club for a while.

If we are to sell Agger, it would obviously have to be at 20-25million, but I'd like it to be done with a replacement target identified, perhaps with negotiations already underway. They don't have to be 22; we've got Kelly and Coates, but they need to be first-team ready, good with the ball at their feet and capable of playing a highish line.",0,1344555958,null,0,false,0,c5qs56q,t3_xyj4b,t1_c5qs56q,t1_c5qqkg9,null,1429597588,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

None. Death is final. An end.

Well, I suppose he kinda died in Let's Kill Hitler?
Smith and Jones?

Hmmm

Anything similar in the classic Series'?

As for that other scene in Let's Kill Hitler, River giving him the remainder of her regenerations(Assumed or fact? Question.)
I don't think that was anything to do with what happened similar to the Master(Being granted new regenerations by the Time Lord council because he had none left.) It's not that he didn't have any left, the poison made it so he can't. Maybe River giving him time energy acted as some kind of defibrillation for him? 

As for the time lock. It's there, impenetrable, and inescapable.(The fact it's there and is as such is made clear in The End of Time.)
Well, inescapable to a point. There was a link to them from outside the time lock(That they created. Wibbly wobbly.) that enabled them to bring Gallifrey(And the rest of what was trapped) out of the time lock. But that link doesn't exist anymore since the Masters actions at the end. but again, wibbly wobbly, you could assume there's another way to escape, or penetrate the time lock because, well, it's Doctor Who. 

Bad Wolf is linked to Rose. 
In The Parting of Ways when Rose looks in the heart of the TARDIS, she leaves those messages throughout time and space, as a message, a warning. 

I dunno what else if this makes sense, I'm a bit drunk and it's late and I tend to ramble so make of that what you will. Lol

I don't think the Doctor goes into the time lock at any point(if at all possible) The loss of his home and his people has had a big emotional impact on him. He did what he had to do to prevent the end of the universe. If he kept popping in and out(if he could) that would open an vulnerability similar to what was seen in the alternate universe episodes(With the Cybermen ""ghosts"" and Pete Tyler from the other universe) that would enable the Time Lords, or worse, the Daleks(Cult of Skaro, etc) to escape and cause all kinds of bad stuff.

I have known people who went to war. Good men, in this real world and in this real life. They have one thing in common. They don't talk about the things they did. The good lie is ""I did what I needed to do"". 

They make rules and they never think of themselves as good men, they just live day to day now as ""good men"". They take it upon themselves to sacrifice and do good because they need to get that something back that was lost. 

I think that The Doctor does good, selfless things all the time. He also has no fear of actual death because he will always regenerate. He's also someone who knows he's caused the deaths of billions of lives. Billions. 

If he were not tormented and effected by that to the core, he'd be a horrible thing to imagine, but he's done it more than once. 

I know that it's an unpleasant thing to imagine a hero as someone who has done terrible things to become that hero but that's the character that I see. I can also relate to it.

How do you reconcile idolizing a character figure who admits to killing everyone on his own planet, and walking away alive  as being saintly? 

I am so being the Devil's Advocate, but I think the character of The Doctor is a very deep one and being only shown 40 years of a 1,000 year old person's life leaves quite a bit to the imagination. Especially if you know the person in question is the most feared person in the universe.

What? Yes there was..
I started watching DW about five weeks ago, and about a week in, I started looking for DW merch. I found a bunch of it...this was a month ago..I have no idea what you're talking about. Regardless, of course DW stuff would be showing up all over the place over the past month or two (as well as over the next month) because of the new season premiering soon, as well as the fact that the Matt Smith seasons really started the popularity over here.

true,i_like_jam,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"&gt; I enjoy watching sports, but never understood the ultra fever pitch behind them (or general celebrities to be fair). But I'm a Man U fan so what do I know :P

It's because people like to watch other people. We like seeing people reaching the limits of fitness and sportsmanship. And we also like watching/hating on people like Jordan. People are generally not interested in science unless the science effects peoples (and more specifically them). E.G. I don't care what kind of minerals scientists find in moon rock. But if you tell me that some mineral found in them has the capability to be used as a renewable, efficient and green resource which will improve our lives if only we can efficiently harvest it - suddenly, the science is much more interesting, because it has (or has the potential to have) a noticeable effect on my life, and the struggle to find a way to efficient mine on the moon becomes interesting to me. 

Unfortunately science can sometimes lack that human element, which is off putting for the layman (myself included). Science needs to become more accessible - it needs more celebs like Brian Cox and successful scientists like Einstein who might become household names for it to firmly take root in our collective conscience. So I agree with you: we need more scientists and engineers in the public's minds! ",0,1344565244,null,0,false,0,c5qufcq,t3_xxlaw,t1_c5qufcq,t1_c5qi6v1,null,1429598664,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

* 1^st He doesn't die, he regenerates.

&gt; One idea that I'm toying around with though is if that if he had died 11 times every 49 years he would have died 247 times. What does that do to a mind? How many times can a Time Lord regenerate?

* 2^nd 'Regenerating' 11 times every 49 years isn't at all true. He has regenerated 11 times since the show started 49 years ago. The 49 years are only in our linear time perspective, the Doctor does not have a linear timeline. As in The Impossible Astronaut, one moment hes 903, the next he's aged 200 years. All of which happened in less than a day as viewed from Amy/Rory/River's perspective.

&gt; Rule one: the Doctor lies

* 3^rd Rule one: The Doctor Lies is only the 11th Doctor's 'rule one'. [Rules by incarnation](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Doctor's_Rules)

&gt; Maybe there's more to that. River Song gave him all of her regenerative energy once, and that was all she had, it took everything she had just for one of his regenerations. Maybe he took many more by force from other Time Lords in the past. Maybe his crime is much more insidious than just ""I killed them all and yeah, they're in some time lock that you'll never be able to see or prove exists, but trust me.""

* 4^th The 'Doctor' you're describing to be dark does not make any sense at all. Remember, this is a show, written by humans. All fiction. The Doctor was written as a hero, with a regrettable past because he feels he committed xenocide. The person that fits your fantasy is better modeled by the Master. And in one case, he actually did try to steal other regenerations. 

&gt; I would love to collaborate on a dark season that explores this angle.
The Doctor spending even a year in some burnt out Mos Eisley style Cantena, where nobody knows who he is, where he can cut the good boy act, and just get back to his roots for a bit. Where he can drop the many rules he has for just a blip on the 1,000 year act of being good. Now, that's interesting.

* 5^th Again, you're better off learning about the Master.

&gt; Final thought, I must have missed something, who exactly is Bad Wolf?

* 6^th Bad Wolf is Rose Tyler after looking into the heart of the TARDIS. She takes the words and scatters it across her time line to lead her to Satellite Five/Game Station.",0,1344574921,null,0,false,0,c5qwtvw,t3_xytuu,t1_c5qwtvw,t3_xytuu,null,1429599806,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The whole situation gives pretty good insight as to why he behaved the way he did. Most other times he only had a chance to say goodbye to those around him (or he was unconscious). Remember in *42* when he had been infected by the living star, he started to explain to Martha what was might happen, no hesitation because their was no time for it. Think of a soldier, if he's in the thick of things he might head into death without a sigh, but tell him he's got cancer and he'll probably be a lot more emotional about it.

On top of that he had to die alone

That being said, the Doctor lives, he's still traveling, he's still running. Rose was still in love after he changed. Several incarnations later and Sarah Jane still saw in him the same man she knew. River loves him regardless of who he is at the time, it's still her Doctor.

 And if through all his changes, the Daleks, born only to exterminate, supreme beings of hate, harboring only the desire to destroy all in their path, deep down they have never ceased to fear the Doctor, don't you think we could accept him after just one change that we liked a little more than the rest?",0,1344577063,null,0,false,0,c5qxag5,t3_xxm0u,t1_c5qxag5,t1_c5qv6xi,null,1435693697,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"Keyword here is Defensive midfielder, not holding midfielder. 

A holding midfielder is required when the team is either balanced between attack and defense or is defense oriented (old Chelsea). But he needs to Hold the role and not leave the defense on their own, hence the change of name. Mikel is a holding midfielder.

A defensive midfielder is one who can provide cover to the defense when necessary but he has another job and that is to link up play from the back line to the front midfield/strikers. This is a role Frank has played in even this season. It is his second most favorable position to play in as he is naturally a box to box midfielder and playing as a DM actually helps him cut down on his work rate. 

When a team is playing defensively then they need holding midfielder/s because their defense is going to be always vulnerable due to the constant loss of possession/letting the opposing team keep the ball and attack while the defensive team waits for it's chances. 

However nearly all top teams which focus on the passing game, keeping possession and keeping the opposing team busy with attacking/counter attacking football mostly do not need a holding player. A player who is decent defensively and can provide link up plus something going forward is always preferred. 

An example is Barcelona. Who do you take as their most defensive midfielders out of the regulars? 

Mascherano who played as the CB this season played not at DM but at Centre Mid when he got the chance not to play center back. Was he still playing defensively? Yes. Did he need to help out the defense in 50% of the chances? No. 

Sergio Busquets who is considered their best defensive midfielder played 95% of the games at Centre mid and not defensive mid. Yet he is called their defensive midfielder because that is the extent to which these teams need their most defensive midfielder to work. They do not need him back at all time and they do not need him to hunt down every player and chase him around like a mad man.

Heck most attack oriented teams actually have average defenders to begin with to add that above. Yet the opponents rarely get the chance to catch them out because of the lack of pace, lack of possession acquired, lack of chances they can create against the pacy players and just not having enough time and opportunity on the ball to do something about it.

We on the other hand have an amazing goal keeper. Great defenders and to top it off players who 100% fit the defensive midfielder position we need to fill who are Essien, Lampard, Romeu and Oscar (if needed). The reason I put Lampard up there is because it is his second best position. He can provide the most balanced mash up of defense + offence and he is the perfect person who can raise the tempo to the fastest possible yet slow it down to snail pace if needed. The second player I'd prefer there is Romeu because of his game reading skill and style of play which will let him slot into these new players.

So that is the reason, with a line up like we are building, we need to forget about the sole holding midfielder or a dedicated defensive midfielder who's job is to just sit back and defend while offering little to nothing going upfront and cannot keep up with the pace of the game. [Edit:]Defending and defending only does not necessarily make the defense better, you can use these tactics to help even more.",0,1344577599,null,0,1344577996,0,c5qxeh4,t3_xyaj8,t1_c5qxeh4,t1_c5qrs8c,null,1429600068,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

The subreddit has been drowning in memes and ""me too"" posts and karma whoring and ""I just thought of this thing that no one else in history has ever thought of before"" the whole time I've been here.

One problem is that people get all fired up about something -- a picture, a news item, a meme -- and they're so excited to share that they *simply do not bother to ever check and see if someone else just posted the same thing.*  They don't know and they don't care.  Because if they checked first, they'd see someone else posted it just before them, and then they couldn't have the excitement of making a post.  It's kind of a bummer, and it's really inconsiderate, but it's not going to stop.  

Some of the old hands here can tell when a wave of duplicate post is approaching -- it's something in the sea air, I think -- and put out a warning to take in the deck chairs and batten down the hatches because 50 separate nearly simultaneous posts are about to tell us that Richard Grant is going to be in the Christmas Special.

I never did understand the tsunami of ""Rory is secretly the Master"" posts that struck a few months back, nor why it disappeared as swiftly as it arrived.  And for a while there I thought the monsoon of ""David Tennant should light the Olympic flame in real life"" posts would never end...

All that said, here's some happy news:

The only exception is material being uplinked from outside the UK, and not intended for reception within the UK - so if you (for example) picked up the Saudi Arabia state TV mux from Arabsat, and nothing else, you'd not need a licence. This would also probably apply to watching things on Hulu via a VPN to the USA, but there's been no test cases of that, so you might get to be the first one prosecuted.

This is what makes live TV on iPlayer (a live broadcast) need a licence, but catch up TV on iPlayer and YouTube videos (both prerecorded material played on demand) not need a licence; watching BBC Three on iPlayer is watching live TV, albeit via the Internet, while watching last week's Eastenders is not, as it's a prerecorded show being played at your request.

I didn't expect them to change the political landscape of the future, but they didn't seem to have the attitude of independence they said conservatism is apparently all about; they seemed to just try and mould themselves to the fit of their society.

true,mrandocalrissian,king,,"Lennon was our best player, IMO.  At times he looked as sharp as I've seen him, playing both on the right and left, and got into some good goalscoring positions.  Walker was decent going forward but both he and BAE were too often caught the wrong side of attackers whilst defending.

The formation didn't work as well as it might because of the centre-mid pairing (again!) of Jenas and Livermore.  The former was totally wasteful; the latter just can't run the midfield on his own.  Neither did a good job of holding, and I was very concerned at how, when Walker and BAE bombed forward, there was no holding midfield and we were often countered on with only the two CBs goal-side of the ball.  One suspects Sandro/Parker would help here.

Gylfi was largely anonymous, but then Jenas couldn't find him.  Bale did not have his best game.  Rafa didn't do much when he came on.  

Defoe played well, within his limitations.  He got into some great positions, but his finishing was a bit weak.  He struggled when Valencia's defence were organized though, further highlighting to me that he can only play up front on his own in games that are stretched or when we are on the counter-attack.  He does have the strength to hold the ball up, but not for 90mins and his passing can be a let-down.

The two CBs did OK, with Gallas being the more comfortable.  Vert was a bit out of position a few times.  He's so comfortable on the ball though!  The offside line was well kept most of the time, but tight.  Friedel looked shaky, for him, and I think he needs to move his starting position close to the edge of the penalty area when we're playing such a high line.

I was not happy to go against my doctors advice and their (ATOS) doctors advice and walk out of that door with a 30kg sack of mail on my back risking further issues from an already uncomfortable abdomen. 

Hey I’m not disputing that, but I don't agree with the way you dealt with it. Working ten years doesn’t give me an excuse to take extra holiday when I feel like it, nor does it give you the excuse to claim sick pay when you are no longer sick.

Of course you shouldn’t have gone back to full duty, but there are a number of ways to sort these disputes short of walking out. 

Your employer has a duty of care to you, and forcing you to go back to full work against your GP’s advice equals *lawsuit*. Had you done something like torn a stitch it would have meant a *major lawsuit*, a hospital visit, and likely worse still for your employer…*a snap inspection by the HSE* (there is no higher power in the land then health and safety law).

Your SHE manager, your HR advisor, even your union rep, they would know these things even if your imbecile line manager didn’t. In a company the size of Royal Mail there would be internal dispute policies designed to properly handle this exact situation correctly.

Walking out and waiting for them to fire you can’t be blamed on ATOS, even if the ATOS system *is* retarded.

true,jesterkid01,null,null,"regarding the tux, when i was at st andrews (grad 09) i found it pretty useful to have at least two dinner jackets, one for the good and more proper times and events and one for just getting drunk in. the latter is known as a battle-tux and you should have pretty good luck finding one in one of the millions of charity shops in town when you arrive at university. 

the battle tux is key because i found that the 'formality' of the university extends beyond the simple big-ticket balls to everything from (somewhat) organized dinner parties to just getting drunk to most any social club events and it is not uncommon to dress for these occasions. the battle tux should be accordingly durable. dont bother getting it dry cleaned much either, unless youve been doused in something gross that soaks in, a good scrub brush and water on the spot will serve. 

as for general day to day, you wont be booed out of class for wearing whatever you want to wear but i would wager that a majority of the male students will be wearing jeans/khakis/chords, leather brogues, a button down shirt and a jacket/sweater of some sort. not necessarily out of any push to be more 'formal' but simply because those are the clothes that they have and some good chords and a solid tweed jacket are great against the near perpetual chill of st andrews weather. 

i mentioned the charity shops above, but ill put some special emphasis on them now. go to them and see what fits. you can often find thomas pink or TM Lewin button downs that are perfectly good for about 3 quid and the second-hand DJ that i mentioned looking for above may run you 20 quid. there is no stigma whatsoever (or wasnt when i was there) about buying second hand.

The Oxford one possesses what I can only describe as perhaps the *only* thing I can tolerate about Tories - that eccentricity some of them seem to posses from not having to fit in with others to survive. So many in Labour seem to think they have to be totally mundane and 'ordinary' to represent ordinary people.

I can imagine I could possibly get on with him, albeit through raging arguments and both seeing each other as completely wrong and totally mad.

(EDIT: Twelve minutes in. He's really starting to grate.)

The Cambridge one is only just starting his segment, but I like how the only book on his bookshelf with a visible title just says 'HITLER' in big letters. Of course it's just an ordinary history book, but I like the placement - makes it feel like satire.

Edit: Just noticed, you can just make out the title of the book next to it, too.... 'HITLER', but in red, I think.

Edit edit: 38 minutes in... I think I'm gonna cry!!!

Final (?) edit:

Just finished watching it. The Oxford one was playing total wargames/career obsessing. Sometimes I wonder how much he seemed to be trapped in a 'game'. Whilst I abhor Conservative politics, he seemed perhaps likeable and interesting, if treacherous. I felt very sorry for him, trying to fit in at Oxford, whilst not coming from 'their' background.

The Cambridge one seemed to be playing dress-up/make-believe because he enjoyed the traditions, etc. Unfortunately for him, I suspect that modern Conservatism is trying to get rid of the element he loved so much (a hyped-up Boris Johnson, almost), as they try to come across as more normal and accessible to non-Conservatives. He was definitely odd, but I don't mean that *in any way* as a bad thing. You could see how the other students thought he was weird and, I suspect, a tad embarrassing and I felt sorry for him. He was embracing an element of the Tory party that I suspect is dying out and he seemed like an old man trapped in a child's body.

I quite liked them both, but felt almost like I was watching somebody descend into drugs. I felt helpless from saving them from the horrible world of practising Conservatism.

About the programme in general, I'd like to see one on Labour and the Lib Dems. I suspect they'd be equally bizarre, but I'd like to see in which ways (if any) they were socially different. I suspect there wouldn't be a great deal of difference. I suspect that they might be a bit more normal and less colourful (although the programme makers of course choose particular subjects), but I don't think that's a good thing. It's not the people I mind, it's their politics (love the sinner, hate the sin!?!?).

On that point about the programme makers choosing subjects, I'm curious as to how staged/selected it is. Everybody felt like caricatures. In some ways, the closed world of a university can encourage that, but the producers must have exaggerated it. The newspaper editor was a particularly glorious edition. All cool leather jacked and taking saucy news calls while discussing work at the pub.

(I also wondered about the segment with the Oxford chap having his photo taken for the paper. Made me wonder how much they were using him, having him pose with a Queen Elizabeth china tea cup.

However my experience has been that a lot of savings can easily be made if the forces are operated much more intelligently and sensibly - ie. in a down to earth and common sense manner .

It is not uncommon when a call comes in for multiple units to respond . A minor incident at an underground station can result in half a dozen units piling in . What's needed is a more mature , competent and sensible approach - one unit that can handle the whole situation . Backup called only where actually necessary .

The same situation exists with Border Control . At the channel crossing they have a bunch of people standing around doing nothing . Then when they do go into action it's one person asking all sorts of inane and useless questions . They don't actually achieve anything . They are not intelligence led . Plenty of people travel frequently to the Continent - nothing suspicious - it's no more suspicious than someone going down to the supermarket . 

The French are far more sensible with their policing and their border control . Their police act to keep things moving - working - they don't act as part of some massive police state . Their border control has far less staff than the British Border Control , is far more welcoming and friendly , is quick and efficient and is much more effective than the British Border Control .

Even having Sandro or Parker back will help.  We just need some continuity with the passing game so that we can sustain pressure.  If the centre-midfield pairing, whoever they are, can just retain possession for a few extra seconds, this will then give time for the likes of Bale and Gylfi to find space and thus have more impact.  They don't need to be spectacularly talented - just someone who doesn't give the ball away so often!  

Our chances were a mixed bag really: no one route. Rarely the result of long spells in possession though (since we didn't have many long spells of possession that resulted in attacks).  Couple of good ones from corners; Lennon and Walker hit the byline a few times and crossed; Defoe held the ball up well a few times and crossed decently.  The best chance was when Kane came on towards the end of the game, playing behind Defoe, and slotting the latter in for a one-on-one (I think it was Kane, anyway).

So, yes, Modric would have made a difference on the ball (though not defensively).  I still don't think his presence or lack thereof will define our season though.  It's more important that we have two new strikers, one who can lead the line, and another to offer depth.

Man Utd vs Southampton. 

Southampton were 6th in the 2nd division at that stage and total underdogs. Of course I cheered them on. And unbelievably they scored through Bobby Stokes. I remember cheering, being very excited and I think this is where I first fell in love with football. I remember thinking that was the greatest game ever, because such a small team could beat a big one, so unexpectedly.

It's interesting to look back and realise my dislike of Man Utd pre-dates my supporting of Liverpool...

A year later I was watching the build up to the 1977 cup final when I remember my Dad telling me that the team that Man Utd were playing were called Liverpool, and that they had just won the league, and not only were they in the FA Cup final, but they had also got through to the European Cup Final (to be held a week later). This meant they were one of the greatest teams ever, and they were in with a chance of winning all 3 competitions. No team had ever done this before.

There and then I knew this was the coolest thing ever, and I cheered furiously for them from the start. It was obvious they were pure class that day. Unfortunately class doesn't always equate to the win and they were agonisingly beaten 2-1.

I was gutted. Genuinely upset. A once in a lifetime chance for a magical treble had gone.  That's when my dislike for Man Utd really took off...

Kevin Keegan was my favourite player. A small man, but almost unmovable off the ball, strong, a great header of the ball and so hard working it lifted anyone who played around him. 

The next week, Liverpool lined up against Borussia Mönchengladbach in the European Cup Final. Liverpool had never won it before, and indeed English clubs had largely struggled with European success being the exception back then. I remember being excited at the shear length of the opponents name, and practising how to say it, so I could tell my mates about the match and get the name right!

It was a magical game. Tommy Smith's last appearance, Emlyn Hughes, Phil Neal, Jimmy Case - I had gotten to know some of the players from the FA Cup final the previous week. I was sure that this was far more important than that competition, since this was for the whole of Europe.

Terry McDermott scored first, but Simonsen brought it back to 1-1. It was nerve racking, but Liverpool didn't buckle. Tommy Smith the veteran defender with dodgy knees scored with a fantastic header and that settled everyone's nerves. Phil Neal converted a penalty nervelessly with 10 mins to go and we won 3-1.

We won 3-1. I knew I was a red then.",0,1344601660,null,0,false,0,c5r0ius,t3_xzncy,t1_c5r0ius,t3_xzncy,null,1429601610,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

So far I have discovered the following campaigns;

1. Scottish Independence (everyone knows about)

2. Welsh Independence (again, everyone knows about)

3. Cornish Independence (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornish_nationalism - sorry, Wiki is quickest to explain)

4. Kingdom of Northumbria (not official enough to have a wiki page - but in response to the hardcore Scots trying to steal Cumbria &amp; Northumbria when the inevitable happens - to the best of my knowledge the Cumbrian's don't care enough yet... either way - a mate of ours is trying to get it on his feet, and is doing rather badly about it)

5. [not yet started properly] but Yorkist Independence... It may not been a proper movement, but an individual listing on the Olympic Medals table is clearly the first step.

We would have to be careful to make sure that Liverpool and Manchester were kept apart or there may be ructions.

I would also go back to proper county boundaries (Merseyside can be split back between Cheshire and Lancashire like it used to be)

This would allow us to have proper county championships to decide who was in the national qualifiers &amp; improve the intensely competitive nature of Olympic selection and then we could see the county medals table as an internal thing at every games... Scotland and Wales could be given an option to either remain as a single entity each or be split into their own counties (they do have them).

**Have your Circumstances Changed?**

Dear [Me]

You may remember you told us nearly two years ago¹ that you didn't require a TV licence. As we mentioned at the time, we're now writing to you to find out if your circumstances have changed. As many people move home or change their circumstances we're not able to put a permanent stop on letters.

As you know, the law requires that everyone who needs a TV licence has one. Please take a few minutes to get in touch with us, so we can ensure we have your most up to date details on our records.

**If you still don't watch TV...**

Let us know by visiting **www.tvlicencing.co.uk/noTV** or call us on [Number]

**If you're now watching TV...**

You need to be covered by a TV Licence. No matter waht device you use to watch or record television programmes, as they're being shown on TV, the law still applies. This includes TVs, computers, mobile phones, games consoles, digital boxes or DVD/VHS recorders.

---

And then the usual how to pay for a licence blurb. 

The online declaration process has changed from three years ago - you just punch in a reference number, pick the reason why you don't need a licence² and confirm it, at which point it [spits out this](http://i.imgur.com/7anri.jpg) and sends you an email. I think two years is the norm for them not contacting you - for some reason I've gone almost three. Probably budget cuts on their end [hopefully, to their inept call centre operatives who'll accuse you quite openly of being a criminal, if you don't have a TV licence, even after you tell them you don't need one.]

¹It's actually almost three years.

²I opted for ""I only watch pre-recorded programmes (on Blu-Ray/DVD/Video). It's actually a combination of that and using iPlayer / 4OD for catch-up only, but as ninereeds314 pointed out TVL are pushing hard for the current iPlayer ""loophole"" to be closed - they want people to have a licence just for owning a device that potentially could be used to watch tv programmes - which is almost everything electrical these days.",0,1344605463,null,0,false,0,c5r15pd,t3_xyrgb,t1_c5r15pd,t1_c5qz0hd,null,1429601906,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"&gt;If millions of non-license players abuse this service, so that license-payers are subsidizing services provided to non-license-payers, that's obviously going to affect future reviews of the law. 

You're only abusing the service, if you use it to watch live programming, without having a TV licence. If you use it the way I, and many other people do, which is solely for the purposes of catch-up, then you don't need a licence. And they could solve the ""using iPlayer to watch live content without a TV licence"" issue - to a degree - by putting a login screen on the live options - you have to enter your TVL number, and have it Geocheck the location of your IP Address¹

¹Obviously not perfect, for a variety of reasons - not least of all, anyone with a modicum of technical knowledge could get around it, but it'd certainly cut down on the number of people who use the live facilities in iPlayer, without having a TV licence.

&gt;Worst case - it could mean that everyone with internet access has to pay for a TV license.

TVL have already conditioned their call centre staff to believe this to be the case - when I phoned up almost three years ago to request a refund on ""unused quarters"" on my licence, and cancel it in the process, the person I spoke to over the phone told me quite openly that owning an iPhone meant I had to have a TV licence. There was not two ways about it. And when I mentioned a computer? According to him the very act of buying a computer counted as ""installation of equipment capable of receiving live broadcasts"". By the time I'd gotten off the phone I'd been told my ""file"" with them would be ""flagged"" and that not only was I not getting the refund I phoned up for - if I didn't renew my licence when the time came I'd be ""investigated"" and fined upto £1000.

Suffice to say that wasn't the case - wrote a letter to the head of TVL, CCd to my local MP, politely but firmly pointing out what the law said, and requesting both a full refund and a guarantee of no contact for at least two years.

Ended up getting a letter acknowledging what I was saying was correct, the refund I'd asked for, and the letter that arrived today was the first contact from them in almost three years.

Now - as for this notion that they'll bring in a law that states you need a TV licence if you have an internet connected device? Big business might be prepared to swallow it, if they can get away with just needing one licence per location, but small business will kick up an almighty shirt storm - can you imagine say a small builders merchant requiring a TV licence because they've got a PC in the office? Or even if they've got a business mobile registered to their business location?",0,1344606150,null,0,false,0,c5r1aqt,t3_xyrgb,t1_c5r1aqt,t1_c5qtipm,null,1429601973,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I've experienced just as much coverage of it as I ever have of any other missing child (except Madeline; proof that more coverage does not necessarily mean more information or results.)

I suspect that considering she's not visible on any CCTV footage surrounding her last known location, or that nobody remembers seeing her... Her disappearance happened quite close to home. I imagine that area is saturated with the news and that if any witnesses knew anything, they would have come forward while the police were questioning neighbours or people were passing out flyers.

Oddly enough I looked up the Premier League on wikipedia, read a bit about the 'Big 4' and saw that Liverpool was the lowest on the table at the time. As a Minnesota sports fan I have a soft spot for underdogs, so not having looked into Liverpool's history, I started following them based on league position alone...

Not that I'm trying to dissuade you from going to Fitz, I'm just telling you what you're signing up for ! Fitz, Churchill, Murray Edwards, Lucy Cavendish and the various bits of Trinity Hall and Girton that compose the Hill Colleges, though out of town, are in a very nice, much greener and much more open area of the city, built with much more modern architecture and more functional interior design.  

Realistically, if you want to get a good idea of which College you'd rather be at, I can only encourage you to go to visit them yourself, this will also give you a first shot at getting to Cambridge, during a holiday period rather than at the start of the year, with all the luggage etc. Much less stressful to do if you've already been there once. If you really have no preference, you can always choose ""Open Application"", where you'll be sorted into a College at random, depending on which ones still have places to fill up. Finally, you may not always end up in the College of your choosing: some Colleges have bigger subject years than others, and you may be pooled after your interview, meaning the College you chose just doesn't have the space for you but thinks you're still Cambridge material, you might just get lucky !

There's actually 2 timelines, sort of.  In the timeline she doesn't kill the Doctor (the one with the time gap) she inadvertently stops time and causes it's collapse.  Which leads to their marriage, etc.  After they touch, time (from the moment she didn't kill the Doctor) resumes and she kills the Teselecta, since it is a fixed point.  Her past self is then taken to prison and everything unfolds as we see in the episodes.

The version of River in the suit goes to prison.  Her memory of killing the Doctor is gone due to part of her programming.  The version of her by the lake is her future self (aren't personal timelines not supposed to cross?) that's broken out of prison after receiving the invitation.

true,TheMarbs,tardis,TARDIS,"First off, the teselecta's ability to manipulate its appearance may not be limited to its ""skin."" If you don't like that answer then I can give you this one. The teselecta's skin intentionally displayed the ""time yellow dusty stuff"" as directed by The Doctor. He was on board at the tie and very well could have given them a better understanding of how it looked. None of the four have ever witnessed a regeneration so we could use the idea that the TARDIS used its psychic abilities to alter the perception of those watching to allow it to appear as a full blown Time Lord regeneration. Another possible answer would be this. These teselecta folks seems to have access to a lot of information. Who is to say that a future, or past regeneration has not been captured on video or some futurish video like alternative?

If you don't like those answers, we can always go with the ""aliens"" answer. 

I believe River's face appeared that way because she was very aware of what she was doing but could not do anything to stop it. She makes this statement.

The River by the lake and the one in the lake are the same River. Eventually the River by the lake becomes the River in the lake. As for where she goes, we don't know yet. Keep in mind that River time travels without The Doctor. Her time line is as wibbly wobbly as as The Doctor's. She bounces through time and space. I think it will end up being one of those things that they never fully explain. We know she ""kills"" The Doctor and we know she goes to prison for it. We also know that she pretty much comes and goes from prison as she wants so the ""which version of her goes to prison"" is irrelevant.

true,Electrosynthesis,null,null,"My advice would be to visit as many open days as you can, so you can get a clear idea of what you like. There is a huge diversity amongst the colleges in terms of architecture, location, modernness, atmosphere etc. You should base your choice primarily on where you would most like to live for the years that you are doing your degree. Do you want to be central? Near the river? Further out? Do you prefer older or newer buildings? Which college's open day impressed you most? Do they have a particularly strong team in your favourite sport? Talk to current students and ask them what it's like at their college, and also ask them what parts of their experiences would be the same at other colleges or are unique to theirs. You can also take a look at the colleges' histories to see whether anything stands out for you there. Perhaps some famous lawyer alumni, or weird stories of how the college was founded, that appeal to you.

Of course you will have to narrow your choices down by whether law is available and how many students they take for it each year, but this will likely still leave you with half a dozen options all of which seem really favourable.

I don't know whether some colleges favour international students more than others; I can't imagine there would be huge differences between them in this regard, since the most important thing they are looking for is how good of a potential student you would be, which they find out during the interview.

I would advise against submitting an open application. It won't technically work against you during the applications process, but I feel as though you will likely have more confidence in the interview if you are applying for a college that you specifically chose and know for certain that you want be there. Plus there's the chance that an open application might end up putting you somewhere you discover you don't like very much.

Sorry I can't give you any advice specific to law, since I'm a mathematician myself. But I can say that your interviewers will be looking for enthusiasm for your subject and will be trying to determine your ability to learn new knowledge and apply it straight away. They'll want to know what motivated your choice of subject (and they might well ask what motivated your choice of college). Details of how much you need to study and prepare for the interview will be different for each subject and will probably also vary somewhat between different colleges.

For instance back when Stephen Gately died, again the Daily Mail were quick to infer that it was due to his lifestyle that he died - and ""how could he have lay there dead for hours, with his parner upstairs?"".

Clint Dempsey seems to play well in a forward role, but only when an back to goal striker is being played before him, so he can gather knockdowns. He wouldn't play in the midfield here either, so I find him surplus to requirements.

Ramirez remains unproven. Let's make sure that isn't forgotten. Although in principal he fits the system, maybe realistically not so much. I would be lying if I said I wouldn't enjoy seeing him in a red shirt, I just don't think that he is the missing piece.

I also want to make note of a part of your post:

&gt;Suarez is on another level with his trickery, almost to the point where it could be hard for anyone to come in and immediately link up with him.

Individual skill and trickery are part of exactly that, the individual. The ability to link up well stems from a smart footballing mind, intelligent movement, and player chemistry which can be established through teamwork. If a player can see the passes he wants to make, and knows the runs he will take, then linking up with him should not be a problem **if the player in question works equally as hard to do so.** Look at the relationship between Gerrard and Suarez, and Gerrard and Torres before that. Three excellent footballing minds with the eyes of eagles. They worked and continue to work together magnificently, because they move as a unit and not individuals.

Glazers selling second class shares with no voting rights to raise cash, which they are short of to pay down the high levels of debt the club is having to pay interest on.

Intially all the money was going to pay off debt, then the Glazers decided they wanted £90m of it for themselves.

Then they listed the shares for between $16 - $20 guide price

then they floated for $14 which isnt a good sign.

I'm not sure but some people say that this is the last real cash cow option available to them short of selling some or all of their stake in the club.


Also if the shares had sold for $20 the club would be valued at over $3 billion but the lower the prices goes and the demand for shares directly affects how the club is looked at to outside parties, some of which believe them to be vastly over valued.

This kind of thing also directly affects all the other clubs in the premierleague as they can use it as a yardstick to measure their own value.

It's sad for Man United as they have excellent turnover and cashflow but are tied down by leveraged debt the glazers used to take over.

true,CockIsMyCopilot,lfcwfmm,,"St. Louis, MO. I've only liked watching sports I've played, which narrows it down to baseball and soccer. I couldn't get into the MLS. I figured if you're going to pick a league, why not the best one, right? So I started watching EPL not really cheering for any certain team, just out of a love of football. After about 3 seasons, I noticed there was one team more than the others that I always had to watch, there was one team that made me leap up off the couch and cheer for when they scored, and there was one team that made me scream at the TV when a questionable call against them was made. It wasn't a conscious decision; out of watching every team for years without ties to any of them, I somehow became a Liverpool fan.

The only other thing I can think of is St. Louis and the Cardinals (baseball) remind me in some ways of Liverpool, the city and the club. Hear me out; it's as simple as the red team colors, but the working class mindset.  The city of Liverpool went thru a lot during the de-industrialization period under Thatcher. Lots of working class guys didn't have jobs, didn't have a future, and didn't know how they were going to support their families. The only sense of pride they had was in their football team. It was all they had to look forward to. It was the only thing that gave them joy, and made them proud to say they were from Liverpool. I think that is a source of a lot of the passion in the fans and what makes it larger than just a football club. For many in the 70's and 80's, it was the only thing that was going well. The same goes for my city's love of it's team. St. Louis fell on some hard times due to white-flight and loss of manufacturing jobs, but we've always had Cardinals baseball, the same way Liverpool has had LFC. St. Louis is bouncing back and recovering, much like Liverpool has been or already has from what I hear. They are both historic clubs with a lot of pride, amazing fans, and a trophy collection that other, fancier, wealthier, and bigger cities would envy. I'll admit that it is a little weird that my love for LFC has surpassed my since-childhood-love of my hometown Cardinals. Probably just because soccer's more fun to watch than baseball.",0,1344620803,null,0,false,0,c5r54ts,t3_xzncy,t1_c5r54ts,t3_xzncy,null,1429603781,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"&gt; You're only abusing the service, if you use it to watch live programming, without having a TV licence. If you use it the way I, and many other people do, which is solely for the purposes of catch-up, then you don't need a licence.

How can you ""catch up"" on a live broadcast when you have no right to watch live in the first place.

Obviously the TV license is a tax, and if you're following the rules you're following the rules. But then I already said the problem is not a legal one. You're still accessing a service that other people are paying for, and if the numbers of people doing that get too high, it will seem to justify a change to the law. I would place bets that that's *why* the BBC don't do anything to secure the system.

&gt; TVL have already conditioned their call centre staff to believe this to be the case

When I cancelled mine, I'd already checked the law because I intended to carry on using a Playstation 2. I asked anyway (so that I could state that the licensing authority had been informed of how I would be using a TV) and they pretty much quoted what I already read from a Citizens Advice book. As it happened, my last TV died on that day too, and it wasn't worth replacing just for an occasional game of GTA, but I personally have no complaints with the cancellation itself.

I *have* had a few letters (in a couple of bursts) which are clearly threatening, and the easiest way to stop those seems to be demanding they carry out the inspection they keep threatening. Though next time around, I've decided to include admittance terms and fees in that letter, just in case they do decide to show up some time.

&gt; can you imagine say a small builders merchant requiring a TV licence because they've got a PC in the office?

As more people move from receiving live TV when it's broadcast to getting all their entertainment through the internet, which is more likely - the BBC will be allowed to die, or small businesses will be screwed along with the rest of us?

**EDIT** - I probably am overstating the issue, but just stating the opinion really isn't meant as ""you're evil if you use iPlayer"" even if that's probably how it looked.

There's certainly nothing about the fees that discourages one type of degree and encourages another. One kid may be just as enthusiastic about media studies as another is about physics.

Ultimately, a university degree costs a lot of money, and although there are some social benefits, most of the gains from a university degree are private (i.e. they accrue to the degree holder)

Your point is that we can't be sure the tuition fee rise is discouraging those looking to take 'less worthwhile' degrees, and that it might discourage those looking at taking more worthwhile courses, but the tuition fee rise is the perfect mechanism for separating these groups.

Where problems emerge under this system, blame can be placed squarely on the individual. If a less able student decides to go ahead and take a worthless degree despite the high fees, it's their own fault when they find themselves under a mountain of debt (obviously, the repayment scheme means they will only repay what they can afford to, but on paper they will owe a lot of money for a long time).

If a more able student looking to take a worthwhile degree decides not to go ahead as a result of the fees, again, it is solely their own fault. The average university degree is worth an enormous amount in increased earning potential, and for any worthwhile degree this benefit will still far outstrip the cost of the higher tuition fees, making a degree one of the best investments a person can make.",0,1344623811,null,0,false,0,c5r60pu,t3_xxj5t,t1_c5r60pu,t1_c5qkt7f,null,1429604198,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

EDIT
Right I feel I need to point out a major issue here. I had positive upvotes for this comment, because lets face it , it's an accurate post.
However I cannot fail to notice that all my downvotes came after a subsequent reply to a reply of this comment.

He has the link-up ability, the pace, the awareness to top off the quality we have up front. Phenomenal player. He would be as sure of a bet for 20+ goals as we've had in years.

Talk about isolating Torres though... I believe that Cavani would be a shoe-in as the starter should we pick him up. Huge step-up in quality, but is it worth the drama it would cause in the dressing room if Torres were not sold before the close of the transfer window? I don't think Torres would be down for another season of playing second fiddle.

In this sense, I almost think Cavani is TOO big of a signing up front for our squad. I don't know if it would be good to totally shuffle strikers (pick up Cavani, loan out Lukaku, sell Torres, find another backup striker) in addition to all of the other changes we have made/will be making.

We set a date for this seasons QPR match, I would fly out from Paris and his uncle picked me up from the airport (I had never met this man before). 

He took me to his house, made me lunch before the game. Gave me his tickets on the Kop and refused to let me pay for the ticket. He got me a liverpool key chain, and then to my surprise pulled out 5 autographed pictures of players (Bellers, Kelly, Adam, Skrtel and Agger. I stared at them and aw while he left the room and came back with a red liverpool ball signed by the ENTIRE squad, including Kenny. 

I told him I thought everything was incredible and started handing them back to him, and he told me ""no, no, no these are for you to take home."" I was dumbfounded and amazed. Not only was this man who I had never met was housing me for free and giving me a free ticket to a lifelong dream, but he gave me these incredible keepsakes.

He drove me to the pitch, picked me up, took me to dinner where we shared a few pints (he wouldn't even let me pay for those!)

My original plan was to get tickets to the league game against Chelsea however I had nothing but trouble trying to become an official member and get tickets from so far away.  I decided to head to Liverpool anyway, if nothing else it would be awesome to hang out with other Liverpool supporters and watch the game, plus there was the added spice of the FA Cup Final.  I figured I could still have a really good time. I arrived the day before the Final and decided I'd head up to Anfield early the next day to hopefully be able to get in and watch the game there.  The event was sold out, however, and even though I was over the moon to be standing outside of Anfield, I was a bit disappointed to not be able to make it inside. I wandered away from Anfield with my head down, feeling much more discouraged than it seemed like I should and after walking by a couple of pubs that were showing the game, my girlfriend pointed out the King Charles, a pub not too far from Anfield. This was the turning point of my life.  We headed in and sat down to watch the game. As the game went on I started having more and more conversations with everyone in the pub about all things Liverpool and I made some really good friends. The owner of the pub ended up being one of the most amazing people I've ever met. He got my girlfriend and I tickets to the league match against Chelsea and on the 8th of May I stood on the KOP for the first time and watched Liverpool utterly dismantle Chelsea. I sang for Dirk Kuyt and Kenny Dalglish in their last game at Anfield and had one of, if not the most, memorable experiences of my life.  The day I left Liverpool the owner of the King Charles gave me his info and told me I was welcome to stay at his pub any time I come back, a LFC cardigan, and a brand new Liverpool kit. I can't even explain how incredible my trip to Liverpool was. I had a lot of fun with the people at the King Charles and an amazing experience at Anfield, as well as many great encounters with both Liverpool and Everton fans while I was exploring Liverpool. It reaffirmed my belief that Liverpool fans are the greatest, kindest and most welcoming fans in the world. It was a beautiful experience and I'm even more proud to be a Liverpool fan because of it.

* Spearing is, well, Spearing. I'm sure his wages aren't very high and he works hard.

Turns out the Picture House is a LiverpoolFC pub.  The regulars passionately showed me and explained all memorabilia attached to the walls.  Met the owner of the pub (forget his name) who arranged an inexpensive taxi for me to get to the game.  After the game I was planning on sleeping at the train station until 4AM when my train was scheduled to leave.  Upon getting to the train station I realized this to be a bad idea as Liverpool is a tough town.  Went back to the Picture House, had a few more pints of 'bitter' and hung around for awhile after the pub was clearly closed.  Great crowd - will return for a pint again someday..

true,bluegreenwookie,mcgann,McGann,"alot of people had that issue, though i didn't.
I loved 9,10,and 11 right away. out of the new series 9 to this day is my favorite, his introduction and him leaving put such a fantastic impression on me.

then 11 is my next. He has alot of the qualities i like about 9, a bit different, a bit odd. Doesn't always quite see what is right in front of his nose. And i love the personality. The mad scientist almost. 

 10 was good. He was a bit to human for my liking. A bit too normal. He was weird don't get me wrong, but not as much as 9 or 11.

also i hated his ending. It was sad but to me it felt forced. They were trying to hard for a sappy ending. There have been other doctors who were scared of dieing but they didn't do anything close to this magnitude and i think that was a big thing that bothered me. 

And i really hated the people who refused to give 11 a chance. I remember hearing alot about how horrible matt smith was, how ugly he was, how bad of an actor he was and that they should bring tennant back. Tennant was the greatest thing ever blah blah blah. So that turned me off to ten for a while as well.

Travelling across the globe to Japan during the already hectic Christmas period is not going to help our league form which I consider to be most important along with the CL. 

While it would be nice to win the other trophies I would be prefer to still be in the running for the EPL &amp; CL towards the end of this season over winning them.

 I lived in Jordan for almost all my life, and recently moved to Toronto, so really I never had the opportunity to meet someone famous or even see them with my own eyes. 

Then comes July 21st. They day I had been waiting for all my life. The day I get to watch the Mighty Reds play. The atmosphere was phenomenal, we were in a predominantly LFC supporter section, and everyone was singing their hearts out. 

Yeah the game only ended in a draw, but it was what happened after that made me run around the streets of Toronto like a pre pubescent teen who had just touched Justin Bieber's garment. My two friends and I noticed after the game that a few players were still lingering around the field. We were in the upper section, and we thought it was too late, but you got to risk it to get the biscuit. So we ran, jumped a bit few ledges until we finally got there. And right in front of us, we saw Sterling walking into the dressing room, Spearing on the phone, Charlie Adam being himself and chowing down on his Subway sandwich, Brad Jones talking to some mates, and the gaffer running the post match interview. 

Danny Agger was still on the pitch however, he was running laps for conditioning. There was around 100 or so people left, and everyone started to chant his name. Eventually after he was done, he came over to the fans, and started signing autographs. When he came over to my side I stuck my scarf out..... He grabbed it.. Daniel Agger grabbed my scarf.. I froze. He asked me to pull it tight, I was still frozen. Eventually I did, and I almost fainted. My favorite player had just signed my scarf.

(I posted this story a while back and somebody found my identity out and posted it, PLEASE dont reveal it, I may change minor (and I mean minor) details to throw people off)

The story of when I played on the Youth team, years ago and was said to be the new 'wonderboy' 

--------------------------------

**Ability:**

I was small for my age (14 - '5,4') and very skinny (7 stone) but my speed, agility and ball control made up what I lacked in power (Robbie Fowler later told me that I had the best balance he had ever seen, but Im sure he was just being nice). Back then I would have said I resembled Owen in playing style but now Id say I played much closer to Suarez, cutting in and out, stop/starting and twisting defenders up, using speed and control to get around.

**Getting Scouted:**

I was invited to extended trials, ET's are tournament style games where 16 teams are assembled with different (the best youth) players from different clubs and big teams send talent scouts out to pick up potential players. I scored 12 goals in 4 games, more than the other top 2 scorers combined, Id still say I was pretty lucky that day, the two wingers on either side fed me a couple of sitters each but I still scored a free kick and a volley. 

**LFC Trials:**

I was invited to trials at Liverpool, being a life long fan I chose to attend and waved off other offers. At this trial was another tournament but with just 8 teams. I remember people who were watching telling me and some other guys that I got scouted with that there were a number of 'wonder kids' on some of the teams, one kid I remember had signed a contract with United when he was 9 but was caught stealing and lost it. 

almost 80% of the kids there had flown in from other countries and didnt speak very good English, didnt matter though because we all knew how to play football the same way. Although I wanted to be a deep lying attacker they made me a deep lying Midfielder, at first I panicked but it all turned out alright when I found myself being fed great balls so close to the box and I was able to do my thing and cut into the box and score, it looked way more impressive than just receiving in the box and finishing. 

**Selection:**

We wound up winning the tournament, I finished on 4 goals in 3 games (what!? the level of competition was ridiculous and it was HOT) and then they gathered us all in while the coaches, scouts and paedophiles that had passed checks went to talk about us. It was nerve racking, nobody spoke a word for a good half an hour before the coaches came back into the room holding envelopes. 

They started reading names out and when they called your name you went up to the coach that had your letter and you left. I was maybe the 50ish name they read out and my heart was killing me! The last 10 or so guys that went before me had bad games so I panicked thinking they made a mistake about who I was, still I kept quiet, took my letter and left. 

I got to my dads car jumped in, didnt say a thing and didnt open the letter for a good 2 hours until my dad convinced me to do it. Letters always make me nervous to this day and I think this moment is to blame, 

*Dear Mr. ElevenReds,*

*Thank you for coming to trials at Liverpool Football Clubs and thank you for your effort and all your hard work*

*Unfortunately not all young player meet the standards necessary to advance further within our youth academy*

FOLD IN THE PAGE...

*However, you have been successful and our coaches and staff were highly impressed with your performance, attitude and ability*

(more details and info on what comes next)

**Youth Academy:**

This is getting a bit long now, but I ended up becoming the Youth Teams top scorer for 3 years straight, but was always 2-3 goals short off the league top scorer. I played against some players  that now play in the prem, Gareth Bale for one (arrogant prick, walked around like he was solid but would cry if anyone even attempted to tackle him, made him look silly a few times). 

I became frustrated with certain players in the team who I felt didnt put the same effort in that I did, It also made me question the staff who though some of the players were good enough to even be in the team and I also became frustrated with the club because (I know suso and sterling say it alot) but there REALLY isnt a lot of players coming through the academy and I started to notice this when academy players i looked up to were being sold or let go and they were amazingly talented. 

**The End:**

They sat me down (was then 16) that they were going to loan me out so that I could get some first team football (which I now know would have been incredible opportunity) but I wanted to be a Gerrard/Owen/Carragher type, you know a player who came up the ranks and I was in my every right to do so, I was there consistent top scorer I should be allowed this. 

They accepted and 2 weeks later we played Southampton, because we had played against one another before and because I had scored a double against them the last time we played I knew they would be gunning for me.

There was this new guy, a REAL arrogant cunt, just talked shit about himself from the start and kept telling our players that he'll knock us out if we think we're big or mouth off. 20 mins into the game this guy has already had cheap tackled a number of our players and stamped on our winger, I see the ball is rolling to him and arrogantly and out of spite of him, I decide Im going to make this game hell for him, I know Im quick enough to intercept the ball but I didnt realise how hard the ground is and I slide in and BADLY roll my ankle.

Youth Career over in a flash, took me 3 years to recover from it but ill always remember the opportunity they gave me.

I put it together, he's run out of room for the sandwich order, and the boys from White Hart Lane had to take a seat outside while he's playing sandwich-box Tetris.

I'd moved to London when I was around 6 and I didn't live too far from Highbury. I didn't have any friends and tbh, back then I didn't follow football, only played it. So to make friends I told them all I liked Arsenal and lo and behold I had about 4 or 5 new friends by the end of grade 4. When I was in grade 5, Liverpool made the CL Final and I remember I was getting chummy with this guy who was a die hard Liverpool fan. I was practically in love with Gerrard at the time and I remember flipping shit when I got Gerrard in one of those card packs if any of you remember them (he was one of the shiny gold ones and along with Yakubu was easily the rarest card). Anyway, I found Liverpool far more attractive than Arsenal but this guy didn't really wanna hang with me because I was ""an arsenal fan"".

true,DrBobert,devon,Reformed Janner,"&gt;Is there a Devonshire separatist movement too?

There isn't, nor do I anticipate one. Cornwall tended not to be conquered alongside the rest of England, which fueled Cornwall as a separate culture. Devon, however, was normally conquered with the rest of England, so the idea of a Devon being unique didn't really take hold.

Devon pride in a national context is not necessarily a relatively recent thing, but the county [only recently got itself a flag in 2006](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Devon). This helped spur on, I think, a unifying of identity. On the whole, the towns and cities in Devon are what a person takes pride in more than the county.

&gt;traditional one that isn't called a pasty but has your main and your afters in (at the same time) is worth a try... think that was in Devon.

The original pasty did indeed have a sweet and savoury element. One half would be meat and veg and another would be some sort of fruit. Imagine a meat pie bolted onto an apple pie. The crimped crust would be discarded, because miners would hold the crust and eat the pasty without getting the filling dirty.

Obviously as time went by the pasty evolved into the delicious thing we have today.

&gt;Also, your roads were a bit better... but still not great - seriously, need more roads like the M6 toll!

Fun fact: The Tamar Bridge has a toll going from Cornwall into Devon, but not from Devon into Cornwall. Because no-one would *pay* to get into Cornwall.

&gt;I need to know why there is a debate about the order you stick stuff on a scone...

A large part of it is the rivalry between Devon and Cornwall. It's one of those things which makes no sense to outsiders but is perfectly reasonable to those involved in it. It's about pride, heritage and looking down, ever so slightly, on your neighbour's silly jam-first ways.

&gt;we have always done butter, then jam (because that's how you do toast), then clotted cream if you have some &amp; then a strawberry slice on top. I need you to explain why this is wrong please.

First of all, a cream tea should never have butter involved. Ever, ever, ever. The clotted cream is all you need, diary wise. Secondly, a strawberry slice?! Good heavens man, get some strawberry jam and be liberal with it! Third, it's 'wrong' because that's what culture says so. It's just unnerving to me to see a cream tea done any differently.

true,Con45,lfc99,null,"This summer I went on an incredible journey with two of my close friends. We drove from St. Louis to Boston to see Liverpool take on Roma at Fenway. Over the course of our 1200 mile, 24 hour drive, we listened to the entire Beatles catalog in chronological order, along with a CD I burned with renditions of You'll Never Walk Alone, including the likes of Elvis, the Kop, and of course, Gerry and the Pacemakers. Along the way, we stopped in Indianapolis, Cleveland, Buffalo, Albany and then finally, Boston.

When we got there, my Aunt and Uncle greeted us for lunch, and then we headed to the Marriott to join our fellow Reds of America at the hotel bar. After hanging for a while, we headed over to Fenway to watch an open training match. From the stands, I chatted with Jen Chang about the tour, and after training, we got to meet some player. I got one of your scarves signed by Charlie Adam, who now holds a special place in my heart. I also got to welcome Borini to the club and shake hands with Joe Cole and Glen Johnson. After training, we drove over to Concord, Massachusetts, and made our base in my Aunt and Uncle's house.

The next day, the boys and I popped over back to Boston for the friendly at Fenway. The place was mobbed with LFC supporters, and I got tons of fantastic fan pictures, including some under the miniature Shankly Gate that made the trip from Anfield. We made our way to our seat in the so called Boston Kop where we made friends with a Scouser a couple seats away. He poked a little fun at my friend, because he was wearing his Wigan shirt. Our new friend was shocked that there was a Wigan supporter in America. Then, a few minutes before kickoff, the crowd started singing You'll Never Walk Alone, a moment that will live with me forever.

The match was exciting. As an American, I can say I was conflicted when Michael Bradley netted the opening goal for Roma. But, I can say I was over the moon when Charlie Adam score on our end while I was wearing the scarf he signed. Although the match ended in a Liverpool lose, I was glad that I got to see some great goals and cheer for my team.

A few days later, it was time for the drive home. We pushed through and made it back home safe and sound. Overall, the trip was a great success.

If we're not going to look after prisoners and help them be better people then we way as well either leave them in prison for life or execute them (neither of which is particularly condone, especially the latter). Otherwise they will be just as much as a danger to society upon release.

The only real reason societies need to put people into prisons is to remove them from a position where they can harm that society. That should extend to ensuring they won't return to doing harm once released, which we aren't very good at doing.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I became a liverpool fan in 2003, at the tender age of 9. Ever since then, i've only had one club on my mind and in my heart. This has been well known through out my family, to the point that i'd be continually offered biographies of Dalglish, Rush, Gerrard, and I believe Michael Owen was even offered at one point (after the move... families a bit slow, i know). 

A Christmas ago, I was in England travelling with my family to visit grandparents, and we were in south devon (very south of england, and west) unwrapping presents. It was all going swimmingly, and all the presents were unwrapped. And then at my end my uncle approaches Me, My brother, and my cousin with an envelope each. I expected it to be a few quid because that was the norm for envelopes, but as we opened it my jaw dropped. Inside were tickets to the Liverpool vs Bolton match at the Kop end on new years. Two days later we travelled up to stay with my family in manchester, and anticipate the match.

Come game day, we left three hours early for the match so i could take in all the sights and sounds of Anfield, and liverpool. As we strolled through stanley park, I felt a part of the crowd sporting my customary 2008 away jersey with Gerrard on the back. I walked past Goodison, and flicked them off in front of my whole family, much to the detest of my mother, and joined in on the crowd's singing of boisterous tunes.

As we approached Anfield we spent minutes to walk around the pearly ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" gates, and celebrate the lost souls of Hillsborough at the memorial. My brother complained about the devotion to history I was showing, but I threatened to expose him as an everton/manc fan if he dared contest me (even though he wasn't). After waiting in the rain for 30 minutes adoring the beauty that anfield has to offer, we gradually went inside. 

The gleaming ground beamed through out the stadium, and my mind went blank. It was as if I was exploring a whole new dimension - my mind was completely shell shocked. It'd been to football stadiums before, but never real *Football Stadiums*, never Anfield. I watched Reina and the subs warm up, and was mystified by there grace in pelting balls at the keeper in such an effortless manner, but with such venom. And the midfielders stroked the ball so calmly as it glided along the recently cut grass. We'd been seated at the top of the Kop end, it didn't matter though, it was the Kop. I saved the receipt. It was the Kop. 

You'll Never Walk Alone came blasting on through the PA's and I immediately stood up and started belting along the lyrics amongst the fellow scousers that I so eagerly wanted to be a part of. My brother and cousin sat next to me, stunned that that this introverted teenager was ignoring all worries, immersing himself in the music. From that moment onwards, I was no longer a fan, I was a lover. I loved the way they announced the names, I loved the way the crowd roared everytime our players appeared, I loved the way Roy Hodgson was given a mixed reception. 

The match went by. Liverpool was playing its boring, long ball, standard Roy Hodgson football. It didn't matter. They could be playing cricket with rugby balls for all it mattered, anfield was a show, the football was the extra. We were drawn 1-1 until the last minute. Finally, Liverpool clinched the winner, infront of the Kop end, infront of me. My 16 year old heart raced, over joyed with the prospect of victory, even against such low level opposition. I turned to the scouse next to me and viciously hugged him with all my might, and turned back to the field. Dirk Kuyt ran into the fans and started celebrating, we all cheered. The final whistle blew. The players cleared off, but we stayed. The stewards encouraged us to leave, but we stayed. We took photos, laughed, cried, talked about the match, but above all, realized how special anfield is. It may not have always been a fortress in football, but its a castle in the hearts of liverpudlians. 

We returned home after countless nagging on the part of my manc/evertonian brother (who at this point was disowned). But to this day, it remains the best present i've ever been given. Anfield is a home, sometimes it just takes a trip to realize it. ",0,1344639849,null,0,false,0,c5racco,t3_y0dnp,t1_c5racco,t3_y0dnp,null,1429606306,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

People like to be seen getting out the pack of cigarettes that they smoke, L&amp;B - builders cigarettes, Lucky Strike - hipster fags (I love that you can say that on r/uk!), marlboro lights - the superdry of cigarettes etc. If everyone has the same packaging then people will be unable to differentiate themselves, you might as well buy Windsor or Pall Mall!

It's like the guy who always orders a bottle of budva (or other posh bottled lager) rather than a pint of something, sure, budva is a nicer beer than grolsh, but the main reason he's buying it is so people can see that he drinks fancy lager. 

So this is why smokers are against it, because if you spend above the odds on some pricey cigarettes, you want people to know what you're smoking. Anything that makes smoking less desirable will stop some people from smoking. 

I'm 100% for this plain packaging, I also think they need to hurry up and force corner shops to install covers - 2015 is miles away! Additionally I'm up for a massive price hike, I think 20 Marlboro are rocking at about £7 at the moment, why not make it a round £10, and slash the amount you can bring in from abroad, oh yeah, and rolling tobacco is way too cheap. Need to tax that the same as cigarettes. Sure, anyone can smoke, but it'll cost you!

Also they need to market stop smoking campaigns not at health, but at the fact that it makes you absolutely stink. Because when I started smoking at 16, I didn't give a shit about my health, but I did want to look cool. 

Perhaps we should re-colour cigarettes a kind of mucus yellow colour. ",0,1344640619,null,0,1344640864,0,c5raiqp,t3_xzi5g,t1_c5raiqp,t1_c5r0j7t,null,1429606391,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It all went very wrong if you remember, but the buy-to-letters have largely been protected from the fall out along with other home owners.

So, the excess in demand was caused by much more than just a shortage of housing supply. That certainly compounded the issue though.

The government have been funding anti-smoking campaigns for decades, and I find it somewhat disturbing that the government is spending my taxes, trying to tell me what to think. 

I admit that when I was a kid there *was* an attraction about certain cigarette brands - some were ""cooler"" than others, and friends of mine with different backgrounds seemed to be drawn to other brands. And I admit that despite knowing that cigarettes were harmful, it didn't stop me for a moment when my mates started smoking. 

The purpose of government is to protect its citizens' freedom, and I think it's fair to restrict corporations from preying upon us, but I think there comes a point at which that's taking the piss.

In recent years we've had the pub smoking ban introduced, the smoking age has been increased, cigarette vending machines have been banned, and shops have been made to cover and conceal their wares. I think there's a point at which the government could say ""ok, let's stop and take a look at the effectiveness of these existing new measures"" before introducing any more. The government is constantly meddling in our social narrative, and I'm very dubious of that, of whether it's really right to do so or that it has the mandate.

A player of Sahin's quality puts us well in the running for the top four, and if we have CL football to offer for 2013/14 we're much more likely to be able to sign the players we want. Are we all forgetting just how good Sahin is?

I know a lot of people are keen on us going in for Moutinho instead, but no other club seems keen on meeting Porto's high valuation of him this summer, so a loan deal for Sahin means we can go after him next summer if we want. Then we'll hopefully have the CL football to make him really push for the move, and he'll be cheaper anyway because he'll have a year less left on his contract. That's wins all round.

I'd prefer the Sahin loan deal if it came with a fixed price option to buy next summer, even if it were set as high as 20m, but I'd definitely take him on loan. Taking Adebayor on loan for last season worked out well in the same way - he helped us into the top four and the only reason we're not able to easily sign a world-class striker in his stead is the ridiculous screwing over we got by by a combination of Chelsea, UEFA, Munich and Barcelona.

Luka stays, he plays like a top pro because 1) That's who he is 2) If he still wants to leave he has to play well to keep his stock up. Anyways my hope is that he stays the whole year, we make the top 4 AGAIN, but this year we aren't screwed out of our spot. Luka wouldn't want to leave IMO if we did make the CL this season. 



He's still young and one of the top 5 at his position in the world again IMO. He could be a key cog for our squad over the next few years in AVB's plan. We have some really really good young talent, Bale/Walker/Sandro/Kaboul/Jan/Hudd/Lennon/Gylfi/Townsend. And with Luka we could keep our consistency in the middle of the pitch where it is so important.

The new facilities are flat out top notch, and the stadium is suppose to be done in 3 seasons. We can be a top top team in the world and play with any other team in the world. 4th/5th/4th the last 3 years, we need to keep it going and Luka could play a huge role.
