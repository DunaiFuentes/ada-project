true,naryn,null,null,"E4 does this with Skins as well, it follows a new group every 2 seasons. The problem was with casting and writing deteriorated over time and story became more over the top.

However I haven't seen that with Misfits, this season has been great in my opinion, whilst I really miss Lauren Socha (Her more than Nathan was not my favourite misfit but one of my favourite tv characters of all time) I think the replacements are doing a good job, easily comparable to Season 1's crew. 

The biggest part to this to me will be that of power and character development, Rudy's power is an incredibly thought out power, it's a very interesting one to contemplate and write about, my suspicions of Abby's power are that it could be extremely interesting [My thoughts are that she can body swap between her and Nadine](/spoiler) and the development put into Alex, Jess and to a higher extent Finn has been good so far. 

Honestly, I would love for MisFits to become similar to Doctor Who, in that the Storm can follow multiple groups, though probably shouldn't focus on the Community Centre, but it doesn't need to have the same cast, which means it can keep on going for longer.

It's not that cyclists are worse than car drivers, it's just they are more unpredictable, you never know if they are going to keep lane discipline, obey traffic signs or lights or even whether they are going to stay on the road at all. We all make silly mistakes in life and I worry that if I'm unfortunate enough to a make a mistake when one of these guys has put themselves in a very vulnerable position I will injure them.

Bear in mind that the age at which people leave home varies massively:

http://www.economist.com/node/15108477

In Britain it is low, but the median age is still 23-24. In Italy it's 30, Slovenia 31, Spain 28. Staying at home for longer is a very good way of having greater equality within society, because older, wealthier workers are subsidizing their poorer children. I went last year to a city in Southern Spain which has over 50% youth unemployment, and the city still looked happier, even in the working class areas, than British cities at their best.

I don't know the motives behind the Tory's proposal, but in my opinion having a general expectation in society that children aren't chucked out by their parents at 18 is a good thing. If children have been badly treated you can then have systems in place to help them.

UKIP opposes multiculturalism and political correctness, and promotes uniculturalism - aiming to create a single British culture embracing all races and religions. UKIP will:

* Restore British values, scrap quotas and political correctness and return to meritocratic principles
* Create a ‘British Register’ of important UK companies, products and brands and amend the UK Takeover Code to safeguard these using set criteria, parliamentary approvals and/or conditions where necessary
* Safeguard British weights and measures (the pint, the mile, etc) which have been undermined by the EU. UKIP will also provide proper support to the Royal Mail and the Post Office as key British institutions
* Require UK schools to teach Britain’s contribution to the world, including British inventions and Britain’s role in fighting slavery and Nazism.

We only have ourselves to blame for not performing a full medical. Given Torres' recent injury troubles and relatively poor form it was a no brainer to do a full test.

Spending 50 million on a player who wasn't confirmed fully fit...whoever made that final decision must be locked up somewhere in Siberia right now.

The RDM sacking looks even more cold blooded.

Credit to our medical staff, he hasn't had an extensive injury since he's been here.

This article may give clarity to the uninitiated as to why Torres is struggling, knee injuries are no joke. But it doesn't change the fact that he simply is not good enough anymore to lead the line for a club like Chelsea. Unfortunately he is our only fit first team striker right now so we have to stick with him.

He's working with a squad that's not great in many areas, and is very thin up front, and is still churning out decent results.  More importantly, the team is playing well.  Possibly excluding the West Brom game, i can't think of a league game where we played poorly.

Rodgers is also dealing with the players very well.  He's bringing in the youth players at a good rate, and helping their development along very well.  He's shown tactical astuteness as well, making good subs, which was something Dalglish very much did not do.

His dealings on the transfer market have been generally good, though not sublime.  Joe Allen is proving to be worth every penny of the ~15m we paid for him, Nuri Sahin is a great player to have in on loan even if he's not getting tremendous amounts of game time, Assaidi is a great buy for ~3m.  Borini's harder to judge, since he's been injured much of the season, but his absence is very pronounced IMO.

Rodgers' performance in press conferences has also been great, not only in terms of not being combative with reporters, but also in terms of how he talks about players, the team, the future, transfers, and pretty much anything.  The substance of what he says is very good as well; he's demonstrated he is very cognizant of what the club needs, where it needs to go.

***TL;DR***: Yeah, Daleks were trikes in some of the greatest, yet hard to salvage episodes up until 1973 when a new design is demonstrated as levitating up a shaft. Then, with fewer appearances and less demonstrations of Dalek power, it's not really clear until they collude with the Master some years later.
____
Flying Daleks were certainly not introduced by the new series, though this is now the known function of mobility.

When first introduced, the daleks used a tricycle wheel system so they could draw power from the static floors of the Dalek city on Skaro (1st doctor, 1963-1964). This is probably not too terribly long (in Whoverse chronology) after Genesis of the Daleks (4th doctor, 1975)- in which Davros saw the nuclear destruction of Skaro and developed the daleks originally as a mad-scientist-esque, Machiavellian mean of preservation of his (the Kaled) race.

After the 2nd doctor's run-in (in the same city on Skaro years later, roughly 1965-1967, many episodes aren't available, but I have what's left), Dalek's habitability and mobility becomes more of a grey area. Daleks appear on Earth somewhat frequently, they have some means to swim/cross flat surfaces, but generally speaking.. Same dalek with some pretty big aesthetic differences. Nothing is mentioned about the functionality other than the adaptation of the eye stalk ""pupil"".

All of this remains unclear despite frequent reappearances of the daleks in lost episodes until the imperial daleks are made by Davros in season 10 (1973) with the third doctor. Davros combats a dalek uprising by working with the doctor on terms of mutual survival to create a new Dalek. Davros, somewhat behind the back of the Doctor, creates the imperial dalek. The Imperial dalek is generally known to have a new metallic pad which is it's first shown ""anti-gravity"" or ""levitation"" function even though there's no Whovian jargon for a title.

-
On a personal note, this is also one of the bigger old nostalgia-hag/hipster arguments I know of- basically being the Dalek is presented as an invincible weapon system with even less character and much more brute tactics- which is then repeatedly defeated, partially befriended, helped and 'eliminated' in multiple episodes on earth as other well as other places over a few short seasons. It drastically changes from the appearance of the Daleks in the 2nd Doctor's time rather quickly in the 3rd and 4th.",0,1354506610,null,0,false,0,c7ab46k,t3_145pdq,t1_c7ab46k,t1_c7a6pnd,null,1430561883,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,virtutefideque,null,null,"I *think* the idea behind that ""wrong order"" theory is that the Doctor lived through TATM first, then was sad that the Ponds were gone, and so he went back a little bit further in time for each of his 4 visits *from* TATM while the Ponds progressed forward *toward* TATM. So the timelines run thusly:

Doctor: (Pond Life) -&gt; The Angels Take Manhattan -&gt; Power of 3 -&gt; A Town Called Mercy -&gt; Dinosaurs On A Spaceship -&gt; Asylum of the Daleks

while, for the Ponds: (Pond Life) -&gt; AOTD -&gt; DOAS -&gt; ATCM -&gt; PO3 -&gt; TATM

**I THINK** anyway. ~~One of the arguments~~ Another argument I've heard for this setup is the light on top of the Tardis. The Doctor changes it in Pond Life, then tells River in TATM that he ""just"" changed it which could suggest he has just come directly from Pond Life. ""Just"" could be relative, however, in that he meant he changed it 5 episodes ago. But maybe not! The light seems to be getting a lot of attention lately 

ANYWAY, the issue I have with this is Rory: if the Doctor is visiting the Ponds out of order, why would Rory remember leaving his charger in Henry VIII's dressing gown? While The Power of Three (and their visit to Henry) might have just happened for the Doctor since he is appearing out of order in this interpretation, it hasn't happened yet for Rory. Anyway, maybe the order isn't so straightforward. Or, like you said, maybe they checked in with Henry VIII twice. But wouldn't that cause problems too? Ahhhhhh, I don't know.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"I'm a big solar advocate, but Germany hasn't produced 50% of its electricity from solar. For a couple of hours on one day, it produced 50% of electricity demand just for that time. As scoutisimba says below, the real averaged figure is something like 6%, which is still pretty impressive. 

Also, they've paid out a lot to get to this stage, their residential energy bills are about double what we have in Britain. The world actually owes them a lot for investing money into the very expensive early stages of solar commercialization, so that [globally we're now just getting to the edge of grid parity](http://i.imgur.com/6vnvq.png) (on that diagram, anything above the line means solar is cheaper for that country). But it'll be a few years yet until solar is competitive in Britain. If current trends hold, it will cross-over with the retail price of conventional electricity in about 2020, and with the wholesale price by about 2030 (which would require the price to drop about 60% from where it is now)*. 

Also, that doesn't take into account the storage problem. Firstly, the peak of solar production doesn't match up well to electricity demand, which [peaks at about four in the afternoon](http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/Electricity/Data/Realtime/Demand/demand24.htm). Secondly, as far North as Britain, solar produces a lot more in the Summer than the Winter. Both factors mean that you have to maintain other capacity for when there's not much sun, either in the evening/afternoon, or in Winter.

All round, solar is for the moment better suited to warmer places. In, say, California, solar production matches up with air conditioning demand in the middle of the day, and there's not the same difference between Summer and Winter, so they'd have to maintain something like 20% backup, compared to our 80% or thereabouts. And their insolation is about double ours, so they get twice the energy output, and hence energy at half the price.

So, although solar is a great technology, and will have a huge impact very shortly in sunnier countries, it won't be partiuclarly sensible in Britain for a good ten or twenty years. I'd maintain low level support for the industry, but the serious investment should be elsewhere, into tidal barrages, nuclear, or onshore wind.

*Edit: I should say that these figures are quite conservative. The long term trend with solar is reckoned to be about an 8% cost reduction every year, but that pace has been a lot faster recently. For instance, [Germany has seen a 60% reduction just in the last five years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Germany-PV-SystemPrice.png), which amounts to a 20% reduction year on year. If the recent trend continues, then solar will be competitive much sooner than I'm estimating. And even if the old, slow pace carries on, by 2030 solar will genuinely be undercutting fossil fuel generation, even in Britain. That's why we should maintain our current investment in solar, not just cut it off. I don't want to give the mistaken impression that it is a folly, it's just a matter of what is economical right now.",0,1354510904,null,0,1354555090,0,c7abyz2,t3_146bow,t1_c7abyz2,t3_146bow,null,1430562344,36,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,36

true,Stormwatch36,cyberman,Cyberperson,"&gt;why did they change so much if all the seasons so far have been doing fine?

A lot of people would say that about the transition between Seasons 4 and 5, so be careful with a generalized statement like that. 

That being said though, I think the huge problem is the lack of two-parters. The Power of Three was a terrible episode purely because of the end not being a cliffhanger. They spend 99% of the screentime figuring out what's going on (perfectly characteristic of two-parters), but then instead of the last 1% building a cliffhanger, it consisted of Eleven waving his sonic screwdriver on its ""make all the problems go away"" setting. It was such a colossal disappointment.

I don't like the way Moffat handled full-season arcs in season 5 or 6. They both had potential and the idea was there, but the execution was lacking and there was never anything resembling a conclusion to either one of them. I like the single episode format, but I feel like the occasional two-parter and *background* running plot element (Season 3 being a prime example of that) are key to it working.",0,1354516475,null,0,false,0,c7acyw3,t3_146k3z,t1_c7acyw3,t3_146k3z,null,1430562815,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

The last we saw the Master disappeared into the Time Lock.  Add to that the cybermen forgetting his existence and the Daleks doing the same, causing a de-escalation of sorts, plus some insinuation that the cybermen might be written completely out of the series soon, and the writers need something to shake things up and bring enemies back.  I'm thinking an unlock of the time war and revelation that the Master has stopped the Time Lords from ending the universe.  If he succeeded in killing the Time Lords' leaders, that might do the trick.  It is then revealed that the Silence somehow sabotaged the Tardis or set a trap for it to blow it up in an attempt to kill the Doctor before he reveals his name and unlocks the Time Lock.

* An Applicant who needs sponsorship; chances are, you will need to conduct a telephone interview first, then wait for flights to be booked, at the cost of the interviewee (sometimes they aren't willing) before a face to face interview can be arranged (this could take up to / over a month). The employer likes the candidate so begins the sponsorship process - This can take in the region of 3 months, and there are a lot of rules.

&gt;Do you ever refer to yourself as ""British""? I find that Americans often refer to people and things from the UK in general as ""British"". I wonder if Australians, South Africans, Indians, Canadians and Kiwis do the same.

true,asiakfiatek,tardis,TARDIS,"Not sure if you're finished with your essay yet but wanted to write something anyway, since “Doctor Who” is hugely important to me. For me it’s more than a TV show, it has helped me through some very tough and dark times in my life.

 I haven’t grown up watching the old series, like a lot of my friends did. As a matter of fact I took some convincing before I sat down and watched the first episode of the 2005 series. But as soon as I watched it, I was hopelessly hooked. I quickly caught up and from then on I have been waiting, always impatiently, for the next episode, for the next adventure, infinitely re-watching the ones already out.
I have a bipolar disorder. I’m ok at the moment, but this is not always the case. And Doctor Who helped me countless times get through the dark and desperate nights, kept me sane through fear and emptiness. The reason why it is so thoroughly appealing to me, and I assume many others, is not the jokes, or the silliness, the overacting or the crazy aliens (although it does help :) ). What gets me, right in the gut, every time, is what the Doctor essentially is: the constant wanderer, the deeply tragic figure of the last of his kind, the flawed miracle, repeatedly left to his loneliness by his companions whether by their or his choice, or the nasty trick of the Universe, always running. And yet he is forever astonished and awed by the world and by others, always ready for another adventure, for another friendship, for another exploration, even when it seems hopeless, even when it hurts.  “Doctor Who” is a story of the things ending, in pain, in fury, in despair. It is also a story of things beginning, in hope, in light, in laughter and awe. In my life things often feel like they’re ending, like I’m being stripped of hope, life, dreams. I need to believe that new starts are possible. I need to believe in courage and wonder and joy. And “Doctor Who”, with its legions of fans, all willing to partake in this wonder and joy, reassures me constantly that it is possible.

For me this show somehow manages to be the ultimate escapism story, and the constant reminder that not only is the escape not possible, it is also unnecessary. Because, as contrite and cliché as this sounds, this world is fantastic, we are fantastic. “I can feel it. The turn of the Earth. The ground beneath our feet is spinning at a thousand miles an hour. And the entire planet is hurtling around the sun at sixty-seven thousand miles an hour and I can feel it. We're falling through space, you and me. Clinging to the skin of this tiny little world and if we let go...” and “Did you know that in 900 years of time and space I've never met someone who wasn't important before?”

All of us Whovians take different things out of the show, watch it and interpret it slightly differently.  Sometimes people think me silly that I watch it so obsessively, that I cry and laugh and immerse myself so much in this made-up world. But I don’t care. I take help, courage and determination where I can find it. “Doctor Who” is one such source.

Midfield is vital to BR's style of play. But from watching the games it looks to me like the midfield players are having a hard time solidifying *their role* in the team. When I consider a MF lineup/formation going into a game, there's a large variety of possibilities with players playing in a number of combinations. 

You can try to attach key players to key roles for example Allen's been able to identify himself as an aggressive defender, competent passer and reliable foot in midfield. But players like henderson, shelvey, suso and sahin don't have too many singular features which seem to shine through. 

Gerrard warrants a mention because he's a prime example of this and it confuses the hell out of me. Even when the formation very clearly identifies Gerrard as a forward player with attack in mind - he will inevitably sit on the half way line and hold the line. I've seen a lot of his shots being blocked and with the exception of his first few games very little going forward short range. It's quite hard to know exactly where or what Gerrard will be doing at any one time. 

Many of these points are good and bad for different reasons. But in terms of identifying a new perhaps backup player for Lucas - it's quite challenging. 

I'd very much like Lucas and Allen to hold that DMF spot and have some static-ness to their play. This cements the role of midfield and doesn't require people like Gerrard to run back and cover. It also gives some midfielders/wing defenders and attackers a basis to attack from. But I can't see any existing players to take that spot and to be honest I think we got lucky with Allen as I don't see many other players being able to fill that spot at all. Maybe if we can combine Gerrard with a younger player, Ger-hendo perhaps.. :P

Maybe I'm putting words into May's mouth (and the thought of putting anything into May's mouth makes me queasy), but I always saw this as a way of helping solve mysteries and crimes rather than a way of ongoing monitoring (they can't possibly have someone sitting there matrix style watching numbers go up and down).  In the same way that phone companies keep data about calls and will tell the police it exists if asked, but won't release the data (usually in the form of this person rang/text that person at this time rather than the actual content) until there is a court order, companies providing online services should do the same.  

It'd save a whole load of time and effort of going to court to discover the company providing the online service hasn't got any data because none ever existed, or they did but it has now been lost, or they do but it is not easily accessible.

I can see the concern of 'what happens if this gets into the wrong hands', but that is why we would have to impose strict data controls and give the ICO a greater control and the ability to levy bigger fines and court sentences where it is breached.  Let's be frank, these companies almost certainly already collect the data and will use it for their own marketing.

Frankly however I'm more worried about the companies who have collected data about us not keeping it secure/had huge privacy breaches *and still not getting fined* (eg the PSN haven't been fined for losing 77m people's credit card details yet) than I am about whether Theresa May can see my conversation on Facebook about whether me and some mates should go out on Thursday night or Friday night.

I've realised that referring to myself as Scottish often prompts a more enthusiastic response when I'm abroad (especially from the French), opposed to referring to myself as British.

In terms of food, etc. it just depends on how specific it is to a particular area, and again, if I'm talking to an American or someone from Europe/Asia.

That's why I feel if the intention is active monitoring then we shouldn't do it.

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","I said competitive industries, not that the individual business was very competitive within that industry.

And it is a competitive industry. Comet did precisely nothing different to the likes of Currys, John Lewis or any of the online boxshifters, and they're all selling electricals, white goods etc.

If anything, they were less competitive because you visited the store, invariably found that for any major purchase you couldn't take it home, you had to wait for it to be shipped from a central warehouse and were pushed into an extended warranty. How's that better than a website such as Amazon?

The figures in the last year Comet made a profit were pretty clear - they weren't an electricals retailer, they were an extended warranty retailer that only sold electricals so as to provide something to attach the warranty to. But that's become rather less attractive lately for a number of reasons:

 1. You can get similar cover on your house insurance to cover every item you own for rather less.
 1. It's hard to justify spending an extra £100-200 on an extended warranty when you didn't really want to buy the new item in the first place, money's tight, you can barely afford it as it is but the old one's broken down and you need a replacement more-or-less immediately.
 1. Many people - perhaps rather more than a few years ago - wouldn't buy anything new without checking out the company online first.

Agree 100%. Or even better the perception should be that the market was perceived as a way of funding society rather than a way of profiting from it.

I agree with you about the importance of storage. One point which is worth making is that something like 60% of the cost of generating electricity from natural gas comes from the fuel itself, rather than the capital of building the plant in the first place. That means that gas can play a large part of the role of energy storage just as things stand, because it's cheap to build a lot of gas backup, even if you don't use it much. If you can generate gas electricity for 12p per unit, and 60% of the cost is fuel, that means maintaining backup only costs something like 5p per unit, which is to some degree directly competing witih hydro storage or batteries. If your renewable resource costs less than the difference, which is 7p per unit, adding it to the mix can actually save money over a pure gas system, simply by saving fuel.

true,[deleted],null,null,"We see snippets of a fight going on, with dying Silents left and right, fast movements and a Scimitar flashing with the reflections of a gasoline fire in the background. Somebody is moving incredibly fast. 

Fade to black.

We see a 30 year old, very athletic man and and a younger, not quite as built (but still fit) man standing on the roof of the Houses of Parliament, overlooking the River Thames. The older one is holding a shrunken head, evidently made from a Silent, in front of their faces so they won't forget. 

The older man is wearing a costume consisting of gold- and silver-plated armour covering his shoulders, elbows, shins and knees as well as a helmet of the same colour, giving him the impression of a medivial knight. His torso is protected by silver chainmail which has been decorated with a card game's spade symbol in the centre. His clothing and long cape are both of a dark blue, fitting the night surrounding them. A closer look reveals that the ancient-looking armour has some built-in high-tech equipment, like wrist-mounted darts, throwing knives, smoke bombs and flashbangs or a helmet computer and thermal imaging equipment. In his hands, he wields a long Scimitar, dripping with dark blood. He is the Knight of Spades. 

Behind him, the young one, his face bathed in darkness. In both of his hands he wields daggers, also dripping with the dark blood. His clothing is of a dark green and he doesn't wear as much armour as his mentor, only protecting his chest and lower arms. His costume doesn't have a cape and much of it is made of leather. As he looks up, the scarf hiding the lower half of his face can be seen. Andy, the One. 

Andy steps forward, his eyes fixed on the shrunken head. ”Knight.” His voice is hoarse and displays a noticeable South London accent. 


”I am listening.” A deeper voice, British, no further accent whatsoever. 


”He almost found out today. I remember him writing a long diary entry about uow something was wrong with his life, how he felt like he was missing most of the day – or forgetting. He also remembered about cleaning the Scimitar.”

”I do not need to remind you how dangerous him finding out about your two lives would be.” And how much it would benefit the Silence, the Knight thinks.

”No, Sir.” 

”Can you supress the memories? Maybe even make him forget?”

”I think so. I'll also try some post-hypnotic manipulation to make him throw the diary away.” There is a reason they call him Andy, the One. His mastery of his own mind is what makes him so dangerous to the enemy, the parasites – the Silence. 

”We are done for tonight,” the Knight states. ”Let us get rid of the gear and then forget...” What a horrible thing it is, forgetting most of one's life for some greater good... Sometimes for months at a time, just living an ordinary life, clueless of who one really is.

”Agreed, let's...”

true,sinhaug,null,null,"If Mourinho's departure is true, I think the timing can be a blessing. Basically, there are 5 clubs I think he could go to.

* **Chelsea** - Abra knows it was wrong to fire Mou. Mou loves Chelsea, still. Our current manager has performed so badly Avram's name is being dangled around. It surely can't last?

* **Man Utd** - SAF wants this. Man Utd fans are probably on the fence since he has never stayed anywhere long term, but they also recognize he is the world's best coach. The good news, I doubt SAF will retire at the end of *this* season.

* **Man City** - Mancini is on borrowed time. Shit CL performance. Without the league, he's out of his job. This is a challenge Mou would cheerish, I'm sure.

* **PSG** - Ancelotti is performing mediocre in the league. They've done okay in the CL, but also had a relatively sub-par group. If he doesn't win the league, he's gone. A *carte blanche* and a title in a new league is not something beyond Mou. He could win the league twice in a row, bring them to the semi-final of the CL, and then jump to a new club, if he wanted.

* **Arsenal** - This is an outside chance. Wenger could decide to leave at the end of the season. Arsenal would need a pick-me-up. Mou would bring exactly that, though they'd have to be prepared to spend big. I also think it'd be in the back of his mind that making Arsenal a challenger would be a massive *fuck you* to Wenger who has seen his side regress since 2004.

The most positive thing to come out of this, potentially, is the availability of the *two* best managers in Pep and Mou. Assuming SAF and Wenger stays (both very likely), it would mean 3 rich clubs fighting over 2 managers. If we walk out of that scenario with Rafa Benitez as our manager still, I might just have an emotional breakdown.

true,notnotcitricsquid,cnty-uk,Stafford,"&gt; The entry level into the top 10% of wealthy households is currently £967,000 in net assets, the ONS said, while membership of the top 1% comes with assets of £2.8m or above.

Does this mean assets as in, owned assets, as in not debt? Or does this include debt (eg: mortgages)? I suspect the disparity may be in that the wealthiest families have a much easier time getting mortgages and the flexibility to commit to mortgages and so although they ""have"" these properties worth £1 million they don't *really* own it, whereas the poorest can't get mortgages / aren't confident in their earning ability to get a mortgage.

Although it doesn't change the ultimate point, it changes the perception. Most people will read this and assume that £970k in assets means they *have* £970k, but they don't really. They have an agreement to have that in 20 years when they've paid their mortgages. 

&gt; The ONS said the top 10% of households have physical wealth of £68,000 compared to the average £18,000 held by the bottom half. More than 95% of wealthy households have a car compared to 58% for the bottom half.

If you're in the top 10% of households you probably have £68,000 in actual wealth, that's a pretty low amount when you consider how that translates to a net worth of close to £1,000,000 through debt and the like.

edit: and as this comment points out the study is inherently flawed, it needs to consider ages and length of earnings:

&gt; http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/comment-permalink/19824625

&gt; Are you sure that part of the discrepancy, at least, is not due to the fact that 'richer' households are often 'older' households where the occupants have worked a lot longer. Thirty-odd years ago my net assets were virtually nil. Now my net assets are at least 5 times those of my daughter and her husband. This, despite the fact their joint income is probably 8-10 times that of me and my wife's.

My earnings puts me pretty high up in the household income levels but my net worth according to this means I'm poverty stricken, but that's because I've only been working for 2 years.

""Think of the phrase 'The ripping of the fabric of time and space'. I wanted to get that 'tearing' sound. So I went to a piano that had all its front taken off and it was just a frame with the strings. I took a key, my front door key and scraped it down one of the strings. That gave the 'rippy' sort of sound. We then took that and changed the speed of it so we could get different pitches. We cut those together, literally cutting the tape with a razor blade and sticking it together. We played it through feedback machines and you play the sound back upon itself as it's recording so you get this ripple effect of the echo. And if you do that when the sound is being played backwards, the echo appears to come towards you. If you then turn it around so that the sound is going forwards, it appears to be going away from you. I wanted to get that 'coming and going' sound, the rising and falling.""

I'm not sure that all of the detail is in the article. While I don't work for Orange, I'm pretty sure that they have a system for sending an SMS when you go over limit.

In particular, was he roaming? There is a practical issue with roaming in that the home operator (in this case Orange UK) is the only party that can shut off access, but the information on charging may come in over a batch transfer (TAP) from the visited operator. This normally comes in hours after the event, and can be days. It doesn't always work this way - sometimes you can get an estimate of cost from purely local data, and I don't know how Orange works in this respect.

A second point is that the customer seems to have incurred all the costs in one session with a high speed download, so he may have been way over the limit before the alarm (or shutoff) could kick in. Even if the customer is in the UK, there is going to be a reaction time.

Bear in mind that this sort of incident isn't in our interest either (not least because although we get the bad reputation, we usually don't get paid). I remember a crisis meeting about six years back where one customer in Germany got an unexpected bill for 600€. That led to several changes in our network to make it easier for the customer to see what their costs are in real time - but that only helps if you know that you need to check. Unfortunately today's high speed data transfers make the problem worse in that if there is any delay in reaction, the customer can be gigabytes over their limit.

true,ctesibius,cnty-uk,"Reading, Berkshire","I work for a mobile phone company.

Any mobile telco in Europe can do some level of content inspection and blocking. This is a legal requirement, so don't shoot the messenger!. There are two levels that they must implement in the UK, but they may go further for commercial reasons. 

Firstly, there is a mandatory requirement to block a small list of sites to every customer. These contain things like child pornography, terrorist resources, and so on. While I don't have the list, the independent rating agency has said that it contains about 200 sites (much smaller than I would have expected). 

Secondly there is age-restricted content. You don't know how old the customer is with a prepay phone, so this stuff is blocked unless the customer establishes that they are over 18 (I think that's the cutoff). You can do this by going in to a shop, or in some cases by phoning up and establishing that you have a credit card. Fixed line Internet access generally doesn't do this because (in contrast to prepay), it's usually a reasonable assumption that there is an adult who owns the connection, and who can take responsibility for deciding whether to use parental restriction software for any children. It's not intended that this be watertight. It's more like the 9pm watershed for content on television.

Thirdly, they may block content for commercial reasons, or charge for it at a different rate, which can be lower as well as higher. An example of the latter would be ""Blackberry"" tariffs, which usually had a flat rate for email which didn't come out of your main bundle.",0,1354556619,null,0,false,0,c7ajg5u,t3_1472zf,t1_c7ajg5u,t1_c7ah5r9,null,1430565940,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

A company can claim for a suit provided to an employee, but it would then be taxed though P11d and the net position is back to where you started. Same for your sarnies (though if it was a company with non ""connected"" employees it could have a free canteen as long as it was available to all employees). 

Petrol for a car used personally can be paid and claimed by the company but again it would taxed on the employee through P11d. The taxable benefit is a flat charge based on the CO2 of the car so it's possible to be a net win/lose but not worth the bother. For VAT there are options but if you claimed VAT on any personal fuel you'd need to apply the scale charge. 

A pool car can have fuel claimed, but then it's only a pool car if not used personally. 

If you're operating a personal service company as you describe, I suggest you research ""IR35"" (loads on this via a google). If HMRC consider you are an employee in all but legal structure then they will try to tax the income as earned income (i.e. payroll of your company). Also the tax deduction and P11d rules.

I think it's the difference between wanting equality and wanting to reverse the problem so that the once-oppressors become the new victims. It's much the same as the way that black-superiority movements tended to cause even more hate towards black people in racist areas than the total equality movements - instead of being a group that said ""we think we're the same as you and want the same rights"", they become a threat by saying ""we want to do to you what was done to us"".

Reminding someone that they have had an easier life with respect to their gender identity (and thus their self-esteem and general mental wellbeing) is a lot different to punishing them for being born like that. Unfortunately I've seen the latter happen far too many times, with people being verbally abused (cursed at, called names, told that they don't deserve to talk to people, told that they have no right to have an opinion on anything regarding LGBT matters) and shunned and excluded, with no provocation, they weren't saying ""oh, I was born a man and I *like* being a man, sucks to be you"" or anything, it was seemingly out of the blue.

The continuation of the monarchy is objectively not positive, if we define positivity as that which promotes good ethics and meaningful social cohesion. If we make it nebulous, with a nod to some sort of warm fuzzy feeling like superficial pride, pomp, flashing colours, waving flags, that sort of thing, then you might be correct. If you want an empty success go masturbate. One doesn't need to be miserable to criticise the monarchy, one just has to cut through the emotive propaganda.

The cost of the monarchy isn't negligible. It's massive. It corrupts Parliament, it corrupts town planning, it corrupts the tax system, it even was the source of the national deficit. There are many hidden costs like policing, special events, and the opportunity cost that could be a prevention of a different monetary, tax and socio-economic system that would lift people out of poverty. In a zero-sum game which is the current economy their gains are another's losses. They also don't pay proper taxes, and the Duchy of Cornwall is an abomination for the modern world.

If I need to use a demonym to refer to myself, I'll say 'British' unless I'm say talking to a Scot and our conversation requires us to differentiate some domestic cultural difference.

If I'm talking only to other British people I'll refer to the specific region of England I'm from rather than making a point of being English. This is because I'd say that as a Northerner I feel closer to parts of Scotland than I do to the South East.

I think the UK can be seen as sort of fractal (in that the closer you look, the more you'll see people identifying themselves by a smaller geographic region). I assume this is the same in most countries…

Depending on your age, and accounting for scientific advances, baby Windsor could well be the monarch of England, assuming there still is a monarchy! :)

Also, working that out, baby Windsor will probably be over 50 when they are crowned, as is Charles going to be, and as will William probably be (unless Charles abdicates).

true,silverraider525,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"The first Christmas special you'll encounter is The Christmas Invasion, and that's right after series 1, and is David Tennant's debut as The Doctor. Next special is The Runaway Bride, and that's right after series 2, which introduces you to Donna Noble. Next up is Voyage of the Damned, which is right after series 3. The Christmas special after series 4, is called The Next Doctor, which to be honest.. I didn't like all that much, but you might.. who knows.   
  
Now.. here comes the tricky part. In between series 4 (but after the Christmas special) there are 3 specials two watch, with the last one being a two-parter, so I guess, technically, 4 specials.   
  
Planet of The Dead  
Waters of Mars  
End of Time- Part 1&amp;2  
  
If you're watching these on Netflix (US), then Planet of The Dead won't be on there, however, you can buy it off Itunes for like $3.. so not a huge expense.   
  
After that you can continue onto series 5, with the Christmas special being A Christmas Carol, which is also not on Netflix, incidentally.   
  
You can continue onto series 6 with the Christmas special being The Doctor, The Widow and The Wardrobe.    
  
Now you can start watching series 7 with this year's Christmas special being The Snowmen, which I'm pretty excited for!  
  
There is also loads of minisodes to check out once you're done with everything, there are usually about 5mins, maybe less.. not totally integral with the story line, but fun to watch. While you can watch them while you're going along in the series, you might mess up and spoil something, so I'd recommend just to watch it after you've finished everything.

3, interestingly, *don't* do this or at least it's arbitrary.

I had a 3G dongle from 3 to tide me over waiting for Openreach appointments [heh, I heard someone ordered their broadband in 1946 and are still waiting for the engineer visit].  The dongle had a 5GB limit and I was told that it was 10p for every MB you even over outside of your allowance... fair enough, it would be fine for emergencies.

Went over my allowance, tried to get online thinking ""I don't mind paying 50p to get this information, it's an emergency"" but BIG SCARY BANNER says ""You've run out of data.  Want to buy more? blah blah blah"".  It was a monthly rolling contract so paying to top-up wasn't an option and you couldn't simply reset your allowance by paying your bill early.  Wouldn't let me online *at all* to do *anything* let alone charge me extra for it.  After about a week, even though I was still out of allowance, it let me on for a couple of hours at the recommended charge then kicked me off again.  I never figured out if this was a system fault or whether this was 3's policy, probably the latter because they're known for being shit.

Example to illustrate: The Lone Ranger uses silver bullets, which to any kid watching the TV show in the 50s or listening to the radio show in the decades prior was completely badass. It gave him a cool edge. Then the 1981 ""Lone Ranger"" movie included a scene in the ""origin story"" part of the film where the Ranger was having target practice with Tonto, and couldn't hit a thing. Tonto offered him a silver bullet, explaining that silver bullets ""fly straighter"" – which as it turns out is BS, but that's not the point.

I am female and if a man (or anyone - my grandma believed women shouldn't work, and said she would refuse to go in a plane with a female pilot or be treated by a female doctor) treats me badly just because I am female then you can be damn sure I will stand up for myself and probably be a bitch about it, because I think I deserve to be treated just the same as any man the same age and with the same skills. However, if a man is treating me with respect and doesn't even mention that I'm a woman, then I'm not going to bring it up and be verbally abusive to him about the fact he is male. I know that I have gone through nowhere near as much trouble as someone who is transexual or transgender, and I would say I've hardly experienced any sexism, but I believe it is the same principle - you don't hurt those who are treating you the way you want them to.

I know that you were addressing the particular phrase of ""cis privelige"", but even that is slightly discriminatory - if you (assuming you're male) said something assuming I was male, ""Hey, remember being too short for the urinals in adult bathrooms"", for example (I don't know - is that a thing?), and I said ""Hey, check your penis privilege"", I'm pretty sure you'd find it to be a bit offensive when I could have just said ""I'm female and didn't go into bathrooms with urinals, let alone pee in them"".",0,1354569545,null,0,false,0,c7ani2p,t3_147dxz,t1_c7ani2p,t1_c7ana2t,null,1430567849,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Caroline is another possibility, as it's the female form of Charles (William's father) and similar to Carol (Kate's mother).  However, having a name so close to the commoner-grandparent will probably be considered undesirable - there is still so much snobbery - so I expect to see Caroline for a middle name.

Another issue is that the child's name may not be their monarch name - assuming there even is a monarchy by the time it grows up.  As mentioned, Queen Victoria's first name was actually Alexandrina.  Edward VII was actually Albert.  Edward VIII was always called David by his family.  George VI was another Albert.

Under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement as subsequently ratified in the Republic and N.I., anyone born in Northern Ireland is free to claim British Citizenship, Irish Citizenship or both in exchange for Ireland giving up it's constitutional claim to the North.

Personally I think it was a good compromise, as it allows people to choose whatever nationality suits their own political and cultural beliefs and has defused a lot of tension that used to be there. Nationalists can be Irish and Unionists can be British and those that don't really give a fuck either way can choose whatever they feel like.

For reference, the password states ""British Citizen"" as the nationality ONLY IF you are actually a British Citizen. Due to our former past as a colonial power it's perfectly possible to be a British National, possess a British passport but NOT have the right of abode within the United Kingdom.

Even on Reddit, where a lot of people make the assumption that everyone else comes from their country or speaks their language, most of the replies will be ""Hey dude, not everyone comes from your country"" rather than ""Check your ____ privilege"" - they're not acting privileged, they're acting ignorant and the ignorance may not be completely out of choice - sure they could have researched something by themselves but they're probably not even going to think about it until someone brings it to their attention. I'm sure there are plenty of trans* people who haven't really thought about what it would be like to, say, be born without a hand, or to be raised in a slum in India. And they probably won't until they meet someone with that experience and are able to ask, or see a documentary on tv, or something like that. Sure, cis people have the fortune not have had to think ""huh, I wonder what it's like to feel that I have the wrong body"" (hey, even I'm not too clear on it all, and I'm going to go and research it because I feel like I'm making generalisations but from what I've been told, that's at least a simplified version), but that doesn't mean they don't want to learn, and they don't want to better understand what they might have said that was offensive.

The situation I saw was at LGBT+ Pride a year or two ago (the + being all the other sexuality/gender groups that aren't represented under LGBT). I was just standing in a crowd watching the procession when a boy and a girl dressing as a boy - I'm not sure if she was simply crossdressing or was transgender or transexual, although I assume she was transgender or transexual from what she said later however I'm going to address her as ""her"" because that is what she was to me as I didn't know whether she wanted to be male or not - came up to the boy standing almost beside me and said something like ""You have no right to wear that flag"" (he had a rainbow flag around his shoulders). He said he was gay and didn't see why anyone shouldn't have the right to wear it if they supported LGBT+ rights. The girl looked disgusted and said something along the lines of ""no, you shouldn't wear it, I bet you're just gay because you think it's fashionable, you have no idea how it feels to be completely different inside, fucking pretender"".

The gay guy looked shocked and hurt, but also defensive and tried to say that he was gay because he was born that way and that he had experienced a lot of low self-esteem due to it and that he had been bullied for it. The girl looked totally disgusted by him and called him a few other names (I think she called him a ""false faggot"" at some point as well) before finally noticing that everyone around was staring. Then she and her friend left. All of them were probably young twenties, but it was clear that the gay guy was very upset by it and he went away shortly after. I don't know if the girl was drunk or had been annoyed by someone earlier that day, or maybe even knew the guy from somewhere else, but he hadn't said *anything* before she started criticising him, so I don't really see how he could have inadvertently said something offensive. He also didn't seem to know her as he was really shocked when she started talking and glanced around to see if she was talking to him.

I know this is the exception rather than the norm, but I'm just trying to say that not all cis-hate or cis-discrimination is necessarily triggered by the cis being bullied, and even if it is, unless they are a ""repeat offender"" of ignorant comments, it's much better to correct them politely and offer to help them learn rather than be offensive and rude.",0,1354571394,null,0,false,0,c7ao45p,t3_147dxz,t1_c7ao45p,t1_c7anmnr,null,1430568147,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

A thought:

When a hospital breaches the A&amp;E 4-hour rule, what happens? Is the hospital offered help to fix whatever the problem is? No, instead it is fined. If this approach is the norm in the NHS, where is the incentive to own up?

When a doctor admits fault. Is he offered help to improve the service that he provides? No, he is given a thoroughly good going-over by the GMC which lasts for a minimum of fifteen months and may end his career. Where is the incentive to own up?

Indeed, the case was raised of a baby who died -- of meningitis? I came in to the programme late -- and who could have been saved if he had been given antibiotics.

If he had been given the right drugs, and had suffered an adverse reaction -- anaphylaxis perhaps -- what would have happened to the prescribing doctor?

( [Anaphylactic reactions following the injection of penicillin or other antibiotics have increased greatly during the past several years.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1532096/) )

When something goes wrong, there is a limited set of possible reasons:

* 1) malice -- harm was intended

* 2) incompetence -- someone was operating beyond their ability

* 3) human error -- a genuine mistake

* 4) it was unforeseeable -- a situation arose that no-one could have foreseen or prepared for

Only in case 1) should someone be punished.

In case 2) the fault lies with whoever employed the person who failed.

Case 3) is very unfortunate but there is little to be done, except perhaps to have more staff so that exhaustion is not a contributing factor in future.

And only in case 4) is it appropriate to use the expression that is trotted out ad nauseum that 'lessons will be learned'.

**Punishing honesty is the greatest incentive to concealment.**

This is just one facet of the problem.

There's also incompetent, business-trained CEOs with MBAs and no hospital experience; overworked staff; authority taken from nurses and given to 'managers'; part-privatization; hospitals at near 100% capacity; geriatric wards full of people who should be at home or in residential care if only the funding hadn't been cut and homes privatized, etc, etc.

Not to mention the current formulaic approach to everything that '*rules are for the obedience of everyone cos wisdom is in short supply.*'

Supposing his ambition is to coach United, being the City manager would probably hinder that prospect so I don't think he'd go for it.

Fergie won't retire this season, I don't think he will until he can stifle the rise of City. To leave United while they are struggling in the wake of City would probably be unthinkable to Fergie, there's no timeline on this of course but I think he has a few years left in him

PSG is a weird one. On one hand they have unlimited resources, which we all know suits Jose. On the other hand, they stand almost no chance of making FFP acceptable losses and playing in the Champions League unless UEFA don't follow through with their threats. All their big spending came after 2010 so it all counts towards their FFP accounted losses and certain players there are on astronomical wages. It would take a lot more money spent before PSG are seriously competing in Europe, at which stage they may not even be able to. I don't think the French League would hold much sway with a man who can pick his job

I don't think Arsenal would pay Jose's wages, let alone finance the kind of transfers he'd want to do to make Arsenal competitive. To put it in to perspective, assuming Jose doesn't ask for an improvement to his Real Madrid contract, Arsenal would be paying him more than double what their highest paid player earns

This may be wishful thinking but as long as there is no background issue that we don't know about, Chelsea looks the most realistic and probable option.

Odds are (and I really dont want either options) Shelvey as a false 9 or Cole..

Id rather we shake things up and have Sterling in the centre, Assaidi on the left and who ever on the right. Sterling is on par at evading players as Suarez but is much quicker on the turn and over distance, not to mention he has the lungs and energy to run full force for 90 and his shooting is pretty darn good. He scored his first goal down the centre and hit the crossbar against spurs in the centre.. worth a gamble, Assaidi would more than make up on the wing

**The other options**

The way we play... Morgan being a poacher would benefit us the most but he doesnt have the agility or turn of pace to be unpredictable, Pacheco is very accurate but is not strong and can and does get bullied off the ball..tough call but Id say Morgan is the better option although being older Pacheco would be the likelier of the 2 to get called up",0,1354575174,null,0,false,0,c7apbd0,t3_147i4y,t1_c7apbd0,t1_c7aoqnc,null,1430568703,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

With the Second Doctor's personality, the companions were designed to be more like partners-in-crime. Beginning with the Third Doctor, the Doctor became more of an action character and so this role was used only once in Harry (for one season) with more preference to the daughter figure (Jo) or more competant partner (Liz, Leela, Romana, etc) because it suited the stories better and provided a dual role that worked; the Fifth Doctor was especially paternalistic and was given a bunch of kids, basically.

I'm all for teams--I loved Amy and Rory--but a single male companion may clash a little bit with the structure and that may be why the writers have been hesitant. I could see a son figure (like young Kazran in ""A Christmas Carol"") but an adult male figure may not need the Doctor as much unless he has previous admiration for him.

""The Beast Below"" and ""Vincent and the Doctor"" are the only exceptions I can think of, but they also have some character things (and are also very good).

Series 6 is a bit tricky since the first half is basically all essential and the second half is more stand-alone. ""Night Terrors"" may be skipped because it is the least related (in fact it was originally planned for the first half, so it seems out of place) and it is also one of the weakest episodes (though a certain nursery rhyme will come up later), and ""The Doctor's Wife"" and ""The Girl Who Waited"" are pretty much stand-alone but also are two of the best episodes.

The advantage with classic names is that they never go out of date and always remain respectable. So even if there's a baby Caroline or Alexandra, and those names soar in popularity, they'll never be trashy.

Charlotte is already quite popular in the UK, it's a lovely name.  Thomas is always a popular and classic boy's name (like most biblical male names).  I haven't seen much use among recent royals though. 

In the UK Thomas has Welsh connotations (as a surname).  There is speculation that the name will include a nod to Wales, as Prince William will one day be Prince of Wales.  However I think David is a more likely choice.  It's more obviously Welsh, and has been used by royals before (it was the name used privately for Edward who abdicated - if you see The King's Speech, they all call him David).

Because I doubt they would do ""double-Welsh"", that might even make Thomas safer ;)

true,IRONic__MAN,lfc68,,"Wow, thanks for the answer bro, really interesting stuff.

Personally, I wouldnt mind Shelvey up top, it's not ideal but i think he has goals in him, he just needs to refine his finishing slightly and and not snatch at his chances like he has been recently. The thought of Cole playing up front makes me shudder!

Sterling down the centre would be interesting, I think he could get bullied a bit though, and he would really miss having Suarez there to distract attention away thus creating the space for him to exploit with his pace. I really hope Assaidi gets a start though, for some reason Rodgers doesn't fancy him in the league. Fitness maybe?

Morgan would be perfect if we had Suarez there creating the chances, I fear there wouldnt be enough created without Suarez for Morgan to be effective, and he wont offer much in terms of hold up play and link-up play. He's defo one for the future though, proper fox in the box. Did you see his goal against Fulham? Took it brilliantly.

Edit: another option could be to play Shelvey in Gerrard's position and whack Stevie G up front. In fact the more I think about it, the more this option appeals to me. 


Alternatively....Enrique has proved he can play anywhere, playing up front would be a doddle for him ;) (sarcasm)",0,1354576420,null,0,1354576602,0,c7apowl,t3_147i4y,t1_c7apowl,t1_c7apbd0,null,1430568880,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

He's the heart and soul of the team at the moment, but it wont be long before he loses the respect from his team mates once his ability fails to keep up with his voice/leadership. We need to plan for the alarmingly near future where we cannot rely on him, we need to move on and do it now while he's still here. 

Theres no point waiting until its 100% obvious hes no longer good enough for this level, we need to get some one else in now to give him competition for his place.

Sneijder hasn't played since September due to injury and we would most likely be looking for his successor in a year or two, provided he even panned out.

true,killthezombie,null,null,"Well, from my perspective, ""wider community"" for me means the world. I'd see myself as a citizen of the world, and not really linked to anyone before or after me. Randomly born where I was into the family that I was. I'm not really interested in being part of a political sect or anything, though interested in the study of history, I don't feel I owe anything to anyone, none of it was my fault.

I'd imagine that if a lot more people around the world were more interested in being citizens of the world than proud of their snapshotted cultural history two or three generations back, there'd be less windows broken over a flag, that ultimately, is only a symbol. A symbol that you'd not have anything to do with had you been born 1000 miles east, and a symbol that will inevitably fade or morph into something else three generations down the line anyway.

I grew up politically aware when I don't feel I should have. I think patriotism is destructive and divisive, and I'm not really sure the point. With that view, travelling and seeing these various cultures has been the most important experience of my life that made me realise how we all share human life together, and weather your Granddad fought hitler or my Granddad was in the Luftwaffe (he wasn't, I'm just using an example!) would be useless and invalid information anyway in the here and now.

To me, Flags are meaningless and seem to be instilled from youth to carry forward a tradition of ""us"" and ""them"" (most patriots respond with saying it would be alright if everyone were together under one flag, but I don't see why we as humans should discern ourselves from anyone else, when we could just not have one at all, and find other things to fill our gap inside!)

-oscar should be deeper than his current position, it suits him better and we are flush with players in that position. 

side note: jt plays left center.

But the teams that move cities are usually teams that were formed within the last few decades. There are exceptions to that, but generally a league will feel that there is a market in a certain city and if it doesn't workout the team leaves. One reason I love the EPL and most Euro teams is because there is such a tremendous amount of loyalty from the supporters of all the clubs. Its always amazing to see. There is such a rich history for every club, and loyalty always seems to be passed down from generation to generation. 

I love all the LA sports teams, but if you go to a Lakers game you generally will find that many of the fans are ""fair-weather"" fans. You have to sit in the nosebleeds to find the real fans.

From experience (successful I might add!), my 3 top tips for any subject interviewees would be:

1. Know your subject basics well - knowing loads of advanced facts is pointless, understanding the key concepts well and utilising them to find out more is.

2. Re-read your personal statement, as they may ask about things you put in there, whether that be books you have read or particular areas you say you like.

3. Enjoy it! Think of it as a chance to discuss and learn about the subject you love enough to devote 4 years of your life to, with a professor who may well be a world leader in the subject, 1 on 1, for half an hour or so. Don't be afraid to say ""I don't know"", be curious and keen to learn as much as you can from the interview.

Best of luck!

I think PSG will be fine for FFP.

[The Swiss Ramble](http://swissramble.blogspot.no/search/label/Paris%20Saint-Germain) does a good job of summing up their finances. It looks gloom, he concludes. However, considering FFP regulation over the next few years states they want to see an *improvement* in finances, I wouldn't be surprised if they can make such broad goals. 

Also, if you look at the type of players they've bought beyond their marquees (Ibra and Silva), you have Verratti, Lucas, and van der Wiel. The combined cost of those was roughly 50m GBP. That's roughly the same as Phil Jones, de Gea, and Young. While Lucas will most likely be on semi-big wages (with extreme bonuses), I highly doubt van der Wiel will have astronomical wages.

The PSG first XI is much stronger than people realize. They're a competent progressive manager away from destroying teams 5-0 with ease. With a relatively easy league, they could theoretically do a Benitez w/Liverpool and just focus on the CL come February (he did it because he had no hope of winning the league, Mou would do the opposite).

They have one of the best up-and-coming goalkeepers in Sirigu. The strongest 2-man CB pairing in the world in Silva + Sakho (debatable, but everyone are leaking goals and Silva is #1 CB in the world). Highly regarded AMs in Pastore (though he has played out wide) and Verratti, with Matuidi and Motta providing steel. Lucas coming in and Ibra up front aren't bad either. They are a full back (two if you don't rate vdW) way from having a top 6 team in the world. 

If they are properly built up a competent manager, I can see this team doing ridiculous things. They need a manager who'd be as hungry to win things as 10 of the players out there, and who can control the 11th, Ibra.

No. No no no.

""We're not the same as you. We have our own culture, and want to be separate"" would be a better way to characterise black panthers.

This is in contrast to the mainstream civil rights movement (""we think we're the same as you and want the same rights"").

true,ben9345,english,London,"London&gt;Brighton&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Eastbourne. I say that as having been resident of the first two and having had many friends and cousins living in the latter and been to visit and stay before. 

Eastbourne is where people go to retire (read: die) and has little to do for a young person so to be honest I would not recommend it at all if your looking for 'fun'. 

[Brighton](https://encrypted.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=Brighton&amp;tbs=imgo:1&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;sei=iXu9UKqeOJO6hAfosYH4Cg) is my true home town so maybe i'm biased but it a very fun place. Many clubs, a busy pier and general seaside stuff, seafood, bars etc etc. Its got a very liberal reputation and hosts one of, if not the, biggest gay pride festivals in the UK and has a big gay community. There are sex shops, lots of pubs and lots of drunk people on a Friday and saturday night. If that's not your thing than maybe city life in not your thing because those things are typical for British towns apart from maybe the sex shops but there are certainly many in London. Both Brighton and Eastbourne have rocky beaches so don't expect to be sunning yourself on luscious golden sand. There are deck chairs but they cost money and yes the water is freezing but in the summer the seaside can get very warm; 20-30 degrees Celsius most days in mid-summer. The advantage of Brighton is that you are in a city with cinemas, pubs, clubs, bowling alleys, museums and easy train access you are also a short journey from the [South downs](https://encrypted.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=South%20Downs&amp;tbs=imgo:1&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;sei=L329UJPaFMfBhAf8nYCABg#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;tbo=d&amp;tbs=imgo:1&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=south+downs+&amp;oq=south+downs+&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.4850.6085.2.6260.13.7.0.0.0.3.155.769.1j6.7.0...0.0...1c.1.lYPTs_-Atck&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=7960fb0a1790dcfd&amp;bpcl=39580677&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667) national park which is very pretty and is very rural too. Taking a walk along the ancient chalky path, the [south downs way],(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Downs_Way) is one of the nicest things I remember from childhood. So you have a mix of both worlds; if one gets too much go to the other. Also there's definitely a casino because I signed up to it while drunk at 1 in the morning but I couldn't possibly remember where it is. London is also only a 1 hour 30 min train ride from Brighton and Eastbourne is 30 minutes away from Brighton so you can visit each one which ever you choose. 

London is different to both. Its where I am now and there is a cultural difference to comprehend. Its big enough that whereas in Brighton you can take a short trip and be in the marina or go to the south downs national park in 10 minutes and be in different scenery altogether, if you go to London you **will not** leave the city. You just won't. Its so large that everything you need to do/want to do is all in a city environment with traffic, cars, buildings, pollution and it all costs quite a lot of money to get around; normal tickets cost £4 but with an oyster card (which you will need) its only £1.90 and £1.30 if your a student. The money difference is to encourage everyone to use oyster cards and the card itself is £7 one off. For some people that's a bit overwhelming, seeing grey buildings for weeks on end but taking a walk in a park is usually more than enough. My university does not have a campus feel or a feeling that you are at a university per se. You feel like you are in a city and go occasionally to university whereas a campus university you would wake up and study on the same campus which feels different. As a foreign student you don'f have to worry about not being welcome. UK cities and London in particular will most probably be more multi-cultural than most places you know. I have a Swiss friend who studies here and at my London uni about half to 2/3ds the course is made up of foreign students. I like it a lot and I guess as foreign student you might too. If your learning English I'm guessing all will be foreign students - European or Chinese and Shanghai. 

Life is fast paced, people can very occasionally be rude especially when they are trying to get somewhere fast (though in general people are good humoured) and accommodation is very very expensive. I am paying £650 a month which is only affordable because I work while not at university, have support from my parents if needed, don't pay council tax as a student and we have 5 people in our house rather than the 4 on the contract which is technically a breach but we wouldn't be able to afford it otherwise so don't tell my landlord. The rental market in London is ridiculous and only getting more expensive. If you can pay and want nightlife and an interesting city then London is definitely the place. You might find it a shock at first but if you can deal with never leaving a city and the drawbacks of price its a fantastic place to live.

Martha legitimately felt used and ignored by the Doctor. Sure he made her life a hell of a lot more interesting, but he also made it logistically difficult for her to carry on any kind of romantic relationship, and at least from her point of view, seemed to put his feelings for others a bit in her face. Unwittingly, to be sure. But textbook ""friend zone"" treatment. Right down to the whole ""falls in love with someone else and asks you for help with it"" bit. Although in his defense, that was under very unusual circumstances. But geez... he made her spend months of her life as his maid in the 20th century! Awful. 

I'm looking forward to the new companion we'll meet in three weeks.

As for is he worth it, maybe he is, he's a strong, quick and compared to our guys really experienced player. Has had really good contributions (about 0.3 goals OR assists per game) in his last 3 seasons and is still 23, ie below our team's average age.

I'm not a big fan and would prefer some other player but if Rodgers felt he was worth it and made the necessary payments, I wouldn't be too upset about it. I reckon the attitude thing is always gonna be there, but hopefully a more sustained role will keep him calm.",0,1354599706,null,0,false,0,c7awnos,t3_148vjs,t1_c7awnos,t1_c7avzi2,null,1430572231,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

He destroyed the last of the Racnoss.

In Tooth and Claw he utilizes what amounts to a big laser to destroy the werewolf and the man it had possessed.

And you can call it self-destruction if you want, but what he did to the Silence was genocide, and he executed it perfectly.

I could tell you about the extraordinary cost of buying 4G licenses, or the huge cost of running out new radio hardware to the base stations, or upgrading the core infrastructure to cope with IPv6, all of which are necessary to provide a 4G service. I could tell you that Orange has to charge highly to recover these costs, and what I said would be true. 

However it's also irrelevant. Mobile phone companies are like any other for-profit organisation: they are established to make money, and they don't have any reason to apologise for that. *Providing* that the costs are transparent to the customer, and that there is nothing like a cartel colluding to inflate prices, Orange can charge what they like, independent of what it cost them. This is not just a legal principle, it is a moral one. You do not need 4G. If you want to pay for it, there's clear information on what it will cost you.

true,BonzoTheBoss,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire,"**How much does the monarchy cost?**

The government pays the Queen and her consort the sum of approximately £40 Million a year. Note, this money goes ONLY to the Queen and Prince Philip, the rest of the Royal family is provided for independently of government funds. This is called the ""Civil List"". The Civil List isn't spent by the Queen directly as her own personal finance either, it is used to pay the wages on her staff and to maintain the various royal palaces and establishments, to pay travel costs and security costs.

In exchange, the monarchy allows the government to run and reap the profits from the Crown Estate (basically all the land in the UK held in trust by the sovereign on behalf of the state) which provides about £260 Million a year to the treasury. Note that while the Crown Estate is technically the property of the sovereign, it is not their private land. It is the land of the people held on behalf of the people by the Crown. The Queen can never ""sell"" these lands or use them at her whim.

This equates to the monarchy costing each UK citizen about 60 pence a year, but acquiring about £2.60 in profit. Which is a drop in the ocean when you consider the revenue from tourism we get partly because of them as well, which is in the region of £7 Billion a year.

From 2013 the Civil List will discontinue, in favour of a new ""[Sovereign Support Grant](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/leg_sovereign_grant.htm)"" which will also provide support for higher ranking members of the Royal Family, but only insofar as to support their official duties (travel, security etc.) and the amount does not increase, it's just the same amount of money distributed across more royals.

**What (other than money) does the monarchy do for the UK?**

The Queen is also an excellent diplomatic representative and host, and can afford to be impartial as she isn't associated with any specific political party or ideology (unlike, for example, the US President). She is generally seen as a good person and members of the Royal family champion various charitable causes. The Queen adds a certain grandeur to any event, and she is seen as a fundamental beacon of stability and tradition in uncertain times (remember for most Brits she's the only queen we've ever had in our lifetimes). I.e. no matter what happens we'll always have the monarchy to remind us of who we are and where we came from.

**Inherited wealth and privilege is bad!**

Is it? How is the Royal family any different from any other ""old money"" family who isn't a part of the government? If you won the lottery tomorrow, odds are you'd want your children and successive generations to reap the benefits of that wealth. The monarchy has just been doing this for a lot longer. There are a lot of families with a lot more money than the Queen, yet I don't see anyone shouting for them to give up all their wealth. Granted the Royal family owns a lot of private lands, but they also generate a lot of employment opportunities on that land.

**The monarchy is undemocratic! She hold all the power because Parliamentary decisions require Royal Assent!**

No. We are a constitutional monarchy, this means all the actual power; the decisions regarding law making, taxes to be levied, foreign policy, public services,the armed forces and wars that we fight etc; are all decided upon by the democratically elected government. Royal assent is often misinterpreted, it is purely ceremonial in nature. To understand it you need to understand the office of the sovereign.

You see, the Queen isn't just the head of state, she is supposed to be the state. She is the personification of the state. I.e. she is supposed to represent all the land, the people and our interests. That is why our armed forces swear and oath of allegiance to the Queen, they're not swearing to the Queen as a person, they're swearing to the state she represents. If the Queen died and Charles took over, the armed forces would still have an oath to the state and it's people. Thus, when we say the Queen must give Royal Assent to any decision made by the government, we're saying that the Queen on behalf of and in the good interest of the state and it's people has approved this decision, made by the democratically elected government.

Can the Queen dismiss the Prime Minister? Can she refuse to give Royal Assent? Technically yes. But she knows that if she ever were to do so without a VERY GOOD FUCKING REASON, she would be instantly ousted from office, and the monarchy abolished. She reigns because we LET her reign. 

**TL;DR:** The monarchy isn't as oppressive or undemocratic as some people believe. She reigns because we let her, and on balance we make more off of her than she scrounges from us.

true,Gammy37,cnty-england,England,"Like OP I also have a daughter in the Brownies, who obviously recites the pledge to god. I don't have a problem with this because at eight years old, she's still of an age where she needs to find her own way with religion. I won't enforce atheism on her any more than a Christian should enforce Christianity. 

When she's old enough to really understand what she does or doesn't believe, then she's old enough to decide if she wants to live with the awkwardness of reciting a pledge she holds no value in. 

I went to Scouts and I said and did all the things I was asked to do and had a great time. Sure, I guess they were hollow words, but I'm comfortable with that because as has been said, I never felt they were there to force me to be a Christian, they were there to teach morals, integrity, good values and provide life experiences. 

Whilst it would be great if Atheists were accepted 'on paper' into these organisations, whatever decision they make is going to have a negligible effect on the memberships because religion is not the primary reason the kids are going.

If you look at goals alone, again in the league - Walcott has 0.22 and Sturridge has 0.25. Over this time though Walcott has played 86 games while Danny has played 68. I can't account for the minutes they played but they have similar statuses in their teams so lets it should be somewhat similar.

I call BS on this article. To pay less than 20% tax in France you need to be a single earner, single household earning  between  €11,720 to €26,030.

That then doesn't take into account any other form of taxation other than income.

Giving the employer staff for marginal tasks (stewarding / cleaning) and the employee gets some money instead of no money, and work experience / training too.

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"His uncle, Diana's brother was ginger, Royal gingers have included William I, Henry VIII, Elizabeth I and Prince Albert and by some accounts Queen Victoria in childhood. Queen Mary, Harry's great, great grandmother was also red haired. The Queen mother came from a Scottish family so bound to be some ginger in there. 

I have red hair and was constantly asked if I was adopted all through school because no one else in my immediate family has it. I got it from great, great grandmothers on both sides. Recessive genes can skip a fair few generations.  Just looking at parents or even grandparents isn't going to tell you what a baby will look like.

Plus If you look at old pictures of [Earl Spencer](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2032/2074175004_0f68bd9e7d_m.jpg) (Diana's brother) he looks like Harry, he has the features - red hair, wide nose etc that are meant to be the basis of the Hewitt theory. 

Add to this that Hewitt has changed his story multiple times, when he was trying to sell stories to the papers he claimed the affair started before Harry was born but he now says it started when Harry was a toddler. It's possible he's the father, but a passing resemblance is really not a good reason to presume that. Not when Diana's brother and James Hewitt also look a lot alike. 

It's all academic anyway, according to law and tradition a Royal Heir is determined not by genetics but by whether a reigning monarch recognises them as legitimate. The Queen recognised Harry as her grandson and the legitimate child of Charles so it doesn't matter if Harry's real father is the Archbishop of Durham or Simon Cowell or whoever, he's still 3rd ...soon to be 4th... in line to the throne. Not even a DNA test showing Hewitt as his real father would legally change that.

This, to me, shows how we need to be more like Iceland and stop forlock tugging to the Superiors in London. Not only do they not care, they're hardly even aware we exist. Our usefulness as a colonial outpost expired when the Empire broke up in the fifties. 

Iceland had a similar colonial history with Denmark, but they were never divided by religion or class the way the English monarchy managed to do in Ireland in the 1600s. That's what this bullshit boils down to- a 400 year old manufactured divide, designed to benefit the Crown. 

Like Iceland, we should all tell them to piss off and build a nation together on the island of Ireland based on secular, socially democratic values, letting banks fail, prosecuting corrupt state officials, renewable energy and crippling alcoholism. 

As an outpost we have influence over nothing, in a unified island state run along the lines of Iceland, we get the second largest say in running the place. 

TL;DR: We could have been a proletariat, farming/fishing based paradise like Iceland. We still can be if we let go of the ridiculous class and religious divides, idiotic government officials and brown nosing to the Tories.

What I am saying is that whilst a voluntary organisation must comply with the law of the land, they should then be free to have any membership rule they like and to not be made to feel bad for doing so by lobbyists pursuing an agenda. 

In this case the Scouts chose to demand an oath to a God of your chosing. Importantly my point is that if the membership desire change then I say go for it, but I also fully support them if they have a vote and instead decide to stay as they are, thereby telling complainers to go elsewhere if they don't want to sign up to the said rule.

They are a voluntary group and should be entirely free to make their own rules (within the law).

I honestly cannot figure out their mind set. They are literally thick. How can people think more taxes is a good thing? More government control is a good thing? The fundamental problem is that government has brainwashed people into not trusting anyone else. Lefties TRULY hate people, that's why they think it's okay to 'force' others to do what they want and have no problem lying in their faces while they do it. All the hatred they claim others have (and thus a problem they have to solve) is projection.

The rioters/ are at least travelling from ""poorer"" social housing areas or areas known to not be safe in general. There are a host of areas in Belfast the mention of which will tell you if you wanted to buy a house there you could afford it at the cost of a deposit almost for the exact same house in a less dangerous area.

Yea a lot of this crap is just an excuse to fight. I recall waiting outside my office for a bus and witnessing a lot of these young pricks starting fights with a group of other ones they ran into right beside the bus stop. The deranged nature of their anger and their willingness to pursue it despite all logical indications that it was a pointless dissipation of energy led me to believe that it is important to them to express themselves through a willingness to commit violence. They have little to define success in their day to day lives other than how other people see their ability to defend themselves.

Organisations can have lots of rules that are perfectly legal, that can cause discontent. Obvious examples include unions opposing rules that a employer has, or a funding body not awarding a grant because of a policy, or a church providing a scout hut in return for church attendance. Finally, the membership itself is willing or not willing to comply.

The ""allowed"" part is that the voluntary group can be perfectly legal in its rule book, but have consent withdrawn by all sorts of different stakeholders. The scouts for example survive because others provide them with the means to do so, and those very people ""allow"" rules to operate. If those stakeholders withdraw their consent then scouting dies.

TL:DR: An organisation can comply with every law, but if they go against the wishes of their supporters they they close.",0,1354631328,null,0,false,0,c7b1676,t3_1492fp,t1_c7b1676,t1_c7b0uu0,null,1430574423,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

I think the simple explanation for this is that they want to maintain the ""high-end"" status of their premier brands, which they perceive to be consumed by people with discerning tastes, so messing around with their recipes would be a risky undertaking. Whereas with the Cadbury brand being mostly mass market, ""low-end"" products, there is no-doubt a sense that their typical customers probably aren't all that discerning about the chocolate they eat.

According to the [explanatory notes for the Equality Act 2010](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/notes), the Scouts are covered because the law

&gt; allows certain charities to make acceptance of a religion or belief a condition of membership, and to refuse members access to benefits if they do not accept a religion or belief where membership itself is not subject to such a condition, if they have done so since before 18 May 2005.

Apparently, the Scouts lobbied for this.  The Act makes seriously depressing reading - it is full of places where the thought process clearly went ""OK, we want to ban discrimination - but this powerful group would get upset if we banned that kind of discrimination - so let's come up with an exemption that would probably only apply to them without mentioning them specifically"".

Generally, the way equality law works is that there are several ""protected characteristics"", such as sex, gender, race, religious beliefs, disabilities, and sexual orientation.  In almost all cases, different groups within a protected characteristic are treated in exactly the same way*.  For example, religious groups are allowed to have male-only clergy, but in principle they could instead have female-only clergy.  So I doubt there would be a situation in which it is legal to exclude non-religious people but illegal to exclude non-Christians.

However, I think HugoRune1965's point was that there would be more of an outcry if the Scouts were excluding Jewish people, not that it would be illegal.
