Whether you like Gary Neville or not, he made an observation about Torres's pace from his own first hand experience playing against him, in that once Torres's would burst away...no one could catch up.

With the 4-3-3 lone striker, you really want that Striker to either have pace or strength. Torres has neither (Knee injury ruined his pace). I feel he'd be really suitable with a striking partner to play off of...simply because Torres's greatest skill is his offside line timing, it's godlike.

He can get in behind their lines and setup his striking partner, but would have a partner to feed him too.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"First thing you do? Watch Genesis of the Daleks. It shows how good classic is and it's a good intro into getting the feel for old tv. And then I find that the best thing one can do is see 2 or 3 stories from each Doctor and then go through classic straight through. Watching a couple stories from all the Doctors is like building a road map before you actually take the journey itself. So here are some stories for each:

William Hartnell, first- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore. The Romans. The Tenth Planet (though the last part is reconstruction only).

Patrick Troughton, second - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

Jon Pertwee, third- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

Tom Baker, fourth The most famous run. There are so many fantastic stories. Genesis of the Daleks, one of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic. And Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

Peter Davison, fifth -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special, andCaves of Androzani!* (the last story)

Colin Baker, sixth- His Doctor is unique with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good.

Sylvester McCoy, seventh. Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis. This is the era where they really try some crazy radical stories.

Let's see. Personally I feel that 3 was not that strong. The Sontaran Stratagem really should have been amazing, as it was a two-parter, but it really didn't hit home for me and the threat didn't feel as real or as menacingly deadly as the other two-parters. I also feel the whole ""Tinkerbell-Jesus-Fairy Doctor"" thing along with all of the other problems with how they portrayed the Master really make it one of the lesser ones, for me. Then again, there's Blink in that, so it isn't all bad.

Four is probably my favorite. Midnight, Turn Left, and one of the most enjoyable companions the Doctor's ever had (a big leap from when we first met Donna as an obnoxious bride) and that finale really knocked my socks off.

Next is probably 1. From The Empty Child to Dalek (an episode I feel is highly overlooked) and the brilliant performance of Eccleston I just really loved this season, despite all the bloom filters and Slitheen.

After that would come Two. Introduces us to Tennant and has one absolute bang-up of a finale. It had it's bumps, but it manages to really pull through with some solid scripts and generally not going too heavy with the screw-ups. Plus, Girl in the Fireplace. Brilliant.

Five. Although I feel that a *lot* of this season dropped the ball story-wise and ends up not even giving a really satisfying (let alone coherent) finale and really mishandles concepts like the Weeping Angels and doesn't seem to know what to do with these cracks it has the *best* pilot of the bunch and has superb special effects, score, and cinematography out of the entire series.

Three goes here, for reasons I've said above.

Six. Completely misses the chance of turning the Silence into real great villains alongside the Daleks and Cybermen by coated them in needless confusion and not giving them any real goal other than ""they're bad"". An attempt to put the ""Big Bad"" role is on Madame Kavorkian, but again this isn't handled well. Plots devolve into needless snarling plots that are unwravled with ridiculous exposition dumps and the character of River Song is absolutely ruined.

It chickened out on killing the Doctor (which literally everybody saw coming) and idd it in the least inventive way possible.

I just made a visual chart where I made tally marks, one for each story. The farther left they were placed, the more I liked each story. For me it seems that series 6 has the most tally marks on the right (poor) side.

My real confusion is series 2 which I have many high ranked stories, but it doesn't make a big impression on me. Most of the stories I really liked came short of being memorable. It's the opposite for series 1 which has fewer stories I love but I remember them so much better. So I put 1 before 2.

I was also confused on 5 which was either just slightly better than 1 and 2 or just slightly worse.

As for series 6, it had 4 stand alone episodes I absolutely adored, its 5 arc stories were too rocky and unorganized to be favorites so they were okay, and its last 4 stand alones could have been better. Mm. Being the most divided, it ranks lowest on my series favorites.

If an older Doctor was acceptable, Bill Nighy would be awesome due to his sheer talent- and the sudden lesson to new series fans that he won't keep getting younger: the longer we go without a mature Doctor, I think, the harder it will be to amend.

I'm from California and did my MSc at University of Edinburgh last year.

I stayed at 88 Causewayside, a self catered post grad resident hall.

I found it to be overpriced and drab but convenient. Very small personal room, large kitchen area, tiny bathroom that's shared. Anywhere between 3-5 flatmates in one floor. The internet is fine but no free telephone (it's a voip system, so calling other students and university is free though), the once a week cleaning service is not necessary, shared washing machine and dryer that are £1.50 and £1 per load. The location is pretty good and the few flat issues we had  were taken care of by Uni management promptly. As well, living with so many grad students in a close area - you make friends quickly, especially if you have a competent RA who organizes weekly pub crawls and events. Not hard to do though, in Edinburgh within a mile radius there's well over 8 million pubs.

Check out gumtree and see if you can't find anything considerably cheaper. The fringe is a bitter sweet time, you'll pay outrageous prices if you arrive this year before the program and have fun but then next year you'll be finishing your dissertation right in the middle of the festival and may catch only a few days of it.

Edinburgh nightlife sucks, Glasgow has a much more diverse and interesting nightlife, just don't get stabbed - train tickets are cheap with a student card, get a student rail membership card (good for a year). Inverness is fun in its own way, I lived and worked in Inverness as a consultant for a while after finishing my degree. It's quaint but has a lot of drug problems.

I banked with RBS which I recommend, free to set up and easy to use, no complaints. I used Barclay's as well to access my Bank of America money via B of A debit card as they have an agreement so fewer penalties when withdrawing. Check around if your bank has any connection like that, saves a few coins.

Eating out is expensive and the food isn't good (that's more a UK complaint), better off cooking at home. Some friends purchased bicycles, I preferred to walk and take bus if needed. Bus fare is expensive, might be better with a student membership.

In the first week or so of class starting try to get a FREE Snapfax, it's like a coupon booklet for students, I used that occasionally for eating out, drinks and taxi fare (save £1!). Some fun festivals are Rock-ness, T in the park, Hogmanay (new years), and Burns day. I hope you like whiskey, Malt of the Month deals are killer.

Closing Time? I'm surprised. In its place I put The Girl Who Waited. How do you feel about that one?

Yes, I think that episodic is the best way. Let's Kill Hitler/A Good Man was the first time in Who history I was worried the show was getting too arc heavy like Heroes, which became mired in its own complexity. Why at this point? Well a casual viewer would be so confused by those two stories.

The huge issue with a complex series arc is that one cannot just simply 'hint' at it like the previous series but have to dedicate several episodes to such a thing as Moffat has endeavored. The problem is that if you dedicate certain stories to full-on plot-arc then it feels disjointed when you suddenly slide in un-arc related stories.

Hm, well besides the fact that the entire plot of the episode could have been *easily* averted with Rory (who has spent *thousands of years* protecting Amy) using *one bloody adjective* when telling her to press a button. Had he said ""Press the *green* button, the whole episode would have been five minutes, tops.

But I digress. Overall, I couldn't really get into it. I think had they told the story from Amy's perspective they could have had more fun. Watching the Doctor act like a manipulative coward and Rory (once again) playing pawn for someone else while playing his only other role of saving Amy just isn't as interesting as the possibility of showing (even in a montage) how Amy became how she is.

The episode flirts with being deep and meaningful a couple times, and even tries to tease making a major change like *not* killing off the doppelganger at the end of the episode. But alas, the status had to be quo, mind you they did a pretty good job of pointing out the Doctor's dickishness (not like it lasts, though, or that they mention the *genocide* he inflicted on a species in the pilot).


I felt that being myth-centric is what killed Heroes as well. It not only prevents new viewership, but if not done right, annoys the true fans as well. The funny thing is, as quirky and cheesy and unbearably goofy the RTD plots were, they at least felt like they were coherent arcs that melded together into a whole world.

I thought the Saxton story was just a silly plot, but the ""Vote Saxton"" stuff was brilliant and felt like there was a larger plan. I don't get that feeling with Moffat's stuff. It's snarl followed by the laborious process of explaining how to untangle it, and a lot of his ""temporal"" stuff is just making it worse.

As for why such an inefficient system of the Tesselecta, that's not a plot hole, just also poor writing. BUT

there is a magical way to explain most of the inconsistencies of things like this. Something I've had to do more and more with Moffat as his brain works this way- imagine that there IS an explanation, but we're just never told it. It's not essential to the plot as to why the Tesselecta is inefficient, and its not like we know everything about everything in the Whoniverse. With this stuff, I just assume there's an off-screen explanation that we may never know about.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Hmm I think that Doctor Who easily crushes Firefly. LOST I haven't seen though. You may be focusing too much on the cons of the show right now. Take a deep breath. Doctor Who is a pretty unique show, obviously because we have a different setting and story each time. I think that we should at least commend Moffat for trying to be so ambitious. So he failed to organize it properly, but we shouldn't entirely scrap the merits of such an attempt.

I do think that this is a pretty rocky series, but in the whole, its only one out of at least 33. And really, entertainment doesn't always have to be plot airtight. Entertainment is designed to entertainment, its never meant to be high literature. The problem is us crazy fans who want all continuity to sit straight because we treat the franchise as an entire universe which must make sense. So we end up checking all the plots.

This isn't so much an excuse for the poor organization but in the whole of tv and tv shows, Doctor Who is one kickass show despite this stuff. Also- something else I thought of, great tv isn't about great plot construction (though that's really important) but about making people feel emotions. AKA entertaining, so really I guess I just repeated myself. Ignore that sentence.

I liked it because RTD put it there without flaunting it. He put it there as if there was nothing unusual about it and the century we live in is full of gay people just as much as straight people. A society where you wouldn't assume one's partner is of the opposite sex but you would rather ask someone right off if their partner was male or female and be fine with it. It was *just there*.

And Moffat is doing it, but I'm less happy about that. It's great that he's promoting it too, but all his gay characters are used as light humor, jokes, and reasons for 'how awesome they are'. Which is great but why can't gayness just be a thing, just be there, like RTDs characters were?

You may be right about flirting with deep and meaningful. Rory's comment about traveling with the Doctor, the tease of perhaps both coming. But what I loved about this story was that a) it was very emotional, something series 6 needed and b) it was a story in which things were *wrong*, everybody did not ""live"", and the Doctor is the bad guy in a more morally gray way.

Which is in great contrast to the rest of the Moffat arc where the Doctor is a bad guy but could've more easily avoided it- Cyberships and such.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Easily? I really wouldn't say that.

Firefly does something that Doctor Who has trouble doing and that's creating a realistic world and characters while telling stories that defy convention and take unexpected turns.

Never once in Firefly did you lose the distinct feel of the world, never did it waver. You got this rich detail in the Chinese-American-Western vibe that's shown in every nook and cranny of the verse, and the plots manage to consistantly keep you on your toes.

Just as you think things can't get any worse, they often do and by halfway through the episode you're genuinely wondering whether everybody's going to make it out okay. That's something Doctor Who has trouble with. In Firefly they let you know early on that anyone can get shot, that anyone can get killed. Doctor Who really wants to do that, but just isn't unpredictable enough to make you believe it'll make such bold moves.

And LOST was just... there's really no parallel. Every show on from ""the Event"" to ""Persons Unknown"" to ""Alcatraz"" are all trying to be LOST, and none have even come close. LOST was just something else. No other show has made me cry or laugh or feel fear as much as LOST has. It's just amazing television, I highly recommend it.

Firefly made me feel those emotions and so has Doctor Who, but when you sacrifice believability suddenly I don't see the Doctor anymore.

I don't see the Doctor, the last Time Lord, the wandering soul looking for a way to redeem his sins and forget his past. I see the Doctor, the oddball in the jacket who says the things that makes the plot go.

Once you break suspension of disbelief the characters aren't people, they're puppets for the writers. They, like everything else, stop being real.

When the Doctor decided to suddenly shotgun marry River the writers wanted you to cry, but I couldn't. There was no moment. I didn't see two characters I had grown to love.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"I didn't find any emotion in the series 6 arc either. The difference between Firefly and Doctor Who is many. Firstly, Doctor Who is a show designed to take place on so many different places/cultures/situations that it goes up and down all across the scales of conventional to unconventional. At some point it may just get too unconventional for your tastes.

Also the show has such a long history and franchise that killing off major characters is a big no no. I am never scared when the Doctor ""dies"" and the companions also (though 3 have died). 

Whereas Firefly does not have one main central character, so I could see big ones dying off after a few seasons (if it had them) and introducing new ones.

No idea about LOST but Netflix and friends keep telling me to take a shot. When I get time.

As for your last three paragraphs about the Doctor as 'the oddball in the jacket who says the things that makes the plot go' that's Moffat all over. Moffat loses the emotion and everything the characters say is designed to be witty/commercial/ or plot filled. Which is his flaw. So you don't like Moffat's writing style.

I love Rory for the fact that he noticed things were wrong and was taking pictures of his patients as proof. I think I fell for Rory's character more as you see how untaxed he is about the doctor and the tardis, he just accepts that ""impossible"" things are possible. Also I love that he always tries to help everyone and actually gives a shit about their feelings, rather than just following every word the doctor says like Amy can do. 

Although I do love both characters (Rory far more than Amy) I think when they do leave from who, it'll be the right time. I've felt the dynamic of Rory always waiting for Amy (although ultimately romantic) getting a little old, the same with the doctor always calling Amy 'the girl who waited'. I have thoroughly enjoyed Amy and Rory as companions but I seriously want Wilf to come and be the next companion, it'd be nice to have a dynamic where the companion was older and not just in their 20's which is all that we've really had. I also think that the dynamic might be better as although obviously Wilf (or any other older character to come in as a companion) would maybe be able to relate to the doctor that bit better as they've lived long enough to value life in a different way. And if Wilf isn't going to be the next companion, it'd be great to have a companion from a different time period to us (like if Astrid actually became a companion, or even a character from the 18th century would be awesome. :) ",0,1331882699,null,0,false,0,c41llb6,t3_qygdy,t1_c41llb6,t1_c41hr6n,null,1428535652,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

The show's nearly 50 years old with (essentially) the same main character, it's survived because it allows for so much individualism from the writers, actors, and staff. If you have too many people editing each other, you might cut out a lot of cheese, but you risk cutting a lot of the uniqueness of each era of the show. Rose was great because she was a painfully average loser who became a badass. River's great because she's an utterly fantastical badass. Combine the two, and you compromise on what made them great.

Anyway, I can't think offhand of any other television shows that allow for such flexibility of story-telling (""The Twilight Zone"" maybe?) so Doctor Who tends to get a free cheese pass from me.

Your opinion that everyone in the UK hates the USA is absurd. To highlight the absurdity of your opinion I gave details of US Government figures showing that the UK provides the most tourists after Canada and Mexico. These are UK Nationals visiting the USA, not US Nationals returning home.

In addition I provided details that show that the favourite *Long Haul* destination for UK Nationals is the USA.

The figures are freely available via google should you care to do a couple of minutes of research.

However, this evidence does not fit your world view that everyone hates the USA so you choose to ignore the data and present it as some sort of conspiracy theory by the USA Government, whilst at the same time implying that anyone who trusts the figures is a sheep being fed information unquestioningly, and at the same time failing to provide any data or sources to back up your argument.

Tell me what possible reason would the US Govt manipulate tourist information ? To what end ? Have you heard of Occam's Razor - if not [click this link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor). It's used to test theories and says that generally where there are two competing theories the simpler one is the one most likely to be correct.

Which is more simple ? That not everyone in the UK hates the USA and likes to visit, or that everyone in the UK hates the USA and the US Govt manipulates the figures to disguise the fact ?

true,E_mE,eu,"Berlin, DE","Do you seriously think this increase of the tax free allowance is actually going to make much of a difference to poorest people in society? 

The rich are receiving a scaleable increase in income, not a defined amount. If you have an income of £12,000/yr, currently we are on 7450 allowance, which means you are taxed £910 a year. When it increases to 10000 a year, then its £400, so a totally extra income of £510, now each month thats £42.50. 

Now shall we look at the extra income of a high earner recieving £200,000/yr. Currently they will need to pay £25,000 in tax (50% of the value between 150K to 200K), which will decrease to £20,000, a extra income of £5,000, which over the year equates to an extra £416 a month.

Now where is the fairness? I promise you its hard to live in £12K year, people on these high incomes NEVER need to worry about financial problems. If anything we should be increasing the tax rates for the highest earners since proportionally they are the group of people who created most of the financial problems we exist in now.

The original inquest refused to allow evidence from after 3:15pm, so the subsequent actions of the emergency services could not be considered.

The reason the Liverpool fans are angry is that much of the evidence remains hidden.  The police were guilty of a cover-up, and possibly also of propagating false stories (to remove themselves from blame).  Nobody from the police has ever taken responsibility for what happened.

Some might say that it wasn't the police's fault, well here's the problem with that - if you create a system whereby fans are held in metal cages, then it's incumbent on those in charge to ensure those cages are used safely.

Fortunately we don't have to take your word for that.

Unfortunately Osbourne has decided that he can't wait for that report and is going to dump it already.

Personally I think it is rubbish.  If you earn over £150k a year, you're not going to notice the extra 10% tax on earnings over that £150k (you'd be taking home £86k at least - over 4 times what the median earner is getting).

/ends pipedream

In all seriousness, I doubt we'll make a big signing (as much as I'd want one). We spent big over the last 18 months for nothing to show for it. Kenny probably doesn't have the faith of the owners, plus Comoli is probably expected to make those calls. It'll be hard to attract top class players without paying silly money, so it's much more likely that we'll be buying some 3-10mil 'bargain signings' based on the profits of selling unneccasry players (aquilani, cole, maybe one of the newer signings).

I suspect next season will be the make or break for Kenny, if he gets us into top 4 with some promising performances, they'll invest heavily for a title challenge in summer 2013. If we fail to get into the top 4, Kenny will probably get sacked and a new manager will come in, at which point all bets are off.

I'm hoping I'm wrong though, and the new owners throw some money at us.

They're kicking up a fuss now because it has suddenly become real, that and it serves as a distraction to the soaring Argentinian inflation which the Argentine government continues to low ball in the face of  non-government analysis.  Argentina is currently critically stress-testing its economy to breaking point, and investors in Argentinian debt and bonds are starting to get very nervous about it as the government continues to ignore the facts of the land and as Argentinian imports continue to soar.  In short, they're doing *a Republic of Ireland*, only Argentina can keep the plates spinning for longer by commissioning Brazilian presses to print more money for the demand Argentinian presses can't keep up with!  The IMF doesn't even believe them so it's not like they're going to have people lining up to bail them out - Argentina needs a big distraction or somebody to blame; cue the Falklands Canard.

Infact come to think of it, listen to the population of the WORLD, the only majority population of any country that doesn't hate America is the USA.


My point was abit askew but what I was leaning towards was that you see facts of one aspect of tourism, you will then say that there isn't a majority dislike for America because of those facts.

 Hence why I suggested seeing numbers and nodding heads. The fact is America and in most cases Americans are disliked even hated in alot of countries if you actually haven't noticed this then there's something wrong with your observational skills or your in denial and think everyone around the world is holding hands and singing together.


Really, do you wear rose tinted specticles?

America is the most disliked country in the world. It's not a myth. It's a fact.

But it's okay, Groupon has ""signed undertakings to make sure that its business practices comply with the law.""

&gt; The OFT said that Groupon had three months to make the required changes to its business practices and that it will ""monitor complaints numbers closely"". ""Should evidence emerge of a breach of any of these undertakings, the OFT will consider appropriate measures, including applying to court for enforcement orders,"" it said.

They break the regulations 50 times. The ASA asked them not to. They still broke the regulations and so Ofcom got them to sign a promise not to do it again. If they still break the regulations then a judge will ask them not to.

This is ridiculously lax. Advertising enforcement needs to be seriously toughened up in this country. Have a look at how many complaints about adverts are upheld here: http://www.asa.org.uk/ASA-action/Adjudications.aspx

true,Rotgrub,null,null,"To be fair the only problem I have with the reforms can be quickly fixed by ring fencing the NHS budget, above inflation investment year on year, and a share of private profits through a private healthcare tax paying directly back into the NHS, but that of itself is still not sustainable in the long term.  Mathematically a public sector that costs more than interest or growth year on year will eventually consume everything; state provided universal health coverage might #1 priority but we're eventually talking of it bleeding from education, welfare, policing, defense, research &amp; development, manufacture, transport, etc.

The only real mid-term concern I have is if a department at a hospital gets less money because of an illusion of false demand as more people go elsewhere.  If that department is allowed to wind down people won't have an alternative other than to go private when the true figures come to light, but as long as the current level of coverage/development is maintained and protected I don't have a problem with a private system running parallel to it.

The idea of putting medical professionals and those that have actually practiced medicine more in charge and scrapping whole tiers of bureaucrats I personally see as a good thing.

There is an elephant in the room that needs to be addressed in a calm and responsible manner.  Unlike in other industries where productivity can be increased and where technology can reduce costs, such things as healthcare and education work in the opposite way - the results should still get better but, unlike other industries, the goal isn't profit but health and a certain standard of education.  A factory can improve its output and lower its overheads.  A school will always take a 5 year old child in and then spend over 10 years developing them up to a minimal standard.  You can't really close that time-frame down.  A hospital will always become more and more expensive in providing the best drugs and treatment on the market.  Technology is improving exponentially. You either settle for drugs that are consistently 10 years behind the cutting edge or you accept that costs will continue to go up year on year above the rate of inflation - and eventually that is unsustainable much like the pension problem.

If there is going to be a sustainable NHS, pension and state education,  which I believe there should be, it will require a pragmatic approach.  Eventually we might have to adopt a hybrid of the French model where the private sector is more of a player (personally I currently prefer the UK model to the French system - but again a need to be pragmatic), and if that is the case then we're right to be doing it sooner rather than later.  Will that mean a two tier system - yes.  The important thing being that the lower tier is still of a high and ever improving standard.

2. Cavani. It has been a long time since I've seen a player with such a nose for goal and such an unbelievable engine. He is like a striker version of Ramires. Those kinds of players are extremely valuable in the Premier League (see: Dirk Kuyt, Wayne Rooney). He would be a huge addition not only in terms of finishing chances, but in terms of winning the ball in dangerous positions (not necessarily through good tackling but through sheer hustle). If we keep up this playing style where we press opposing defenders on the ball, he would fit in perfectly.

3. Someone young and not particularly expensive to fill in at RB. People keep saying Van der Wiel, but I've never been impressed with him. He would be terribly overpriced too since there is not much to choose from on the RB market. Ivanovic clearly proved this week that the RB position is his and his alone, and Bosingwa (as much as I cannot stand him) is not terrible cover, considering how few quality RBs there are.

Hence the term coming about - a beard. A way of hiding their homosexual tendencies. Over time it has been applied to wives/girlfriends who are ""beards"" in the sense that they're about hiding the gay man's true sexual preference. 

I've heard the term probably more in the US than in the UK, so I always assumed it was something thrown in as a nod and a wink to the US. 

As it is well known RTD has put lots of this sort of innuendo into the series. Some think it is because of him being a gay man himself, I more like to think of it as carrying on the tradition of carry on films, and classic British sitcoms. They always threw in the odd double meaning and suggestive adult theme here and there.

Just as people have freedom of choice to be gay, the church has a freedom of choice not to support it.

Again, don't confuse me with a gay basher here, i know its cliche, but I've got gay friends who know my views, I really really don't care if people want to be gay, I don't look at or treat them any differently than my other mates.. but I can still think homosexuality is unnatural.

And as for ""the only reason we have homophobia is directly related to religion in the first place.""

true,Noodlehands,null,null,"&gt;This, it should be said, has not just been an issue within the Conservative party. Thatcher arrived in power with what was, in retrospect, a remarkably timid manifesto for change, and although she became bolder as her career as Prime Minister progressed she retained a strong belief in the power of government regulation over the businesses that she privatised. Her legacy was regulated capitalism: ownership in private hands, with some power to control those sold-off enterprises retained by state-appointed regulators that were one stage removed from the ministers who appointed them.

&gt;John Major oversaw a collapse in the credibility of government, and something more besides. It was on his watch that the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) began, and it was on his watch that some of the more absurd privatisations, such as that of the railways, were undertaken. It was John Major who began the process of outsourcing. A weak Prime Minister ran away from his responsibilities: the cowardly state was by now in full flow.

&gt;Tony Blair continued the process. It was he who promised the ‘The Third Way’, not that anyone knew what it was, any more than anybody now knows what David Cameron’s ‘Big Society’ might be. Both, however, have a hallmark in common: they meant ‘anyone but government’, and that was the intention.

Alonso for his defensive cover and distribution, and Gerrard circa 2000 for his box-to-box play.  God speaks for Himself, and Torres in his prime to work that inside-left channel and get on the end of Alonso, Macca, and Gerrard's through balls.  Dudek as backup keeper, because calamity James isn't coming anywhere near this team.  Skrtel is really developing into a great, complete, centre-back.

As for being like FarScape I don't think so in as much that Doctor Who is more about time travel than space, that is mainly there to allow them to explore the universe at any time and any place. You don't see many epic space battles etc. 

I'd recommend starting with the modern reboot. This starts with the ""9th"" Doctor. It pretty much is a clean start for people who've not followed the series from the beginning. 

Its a Sci-fi classic and it has a tone and charm all of its own that you don't find in many other series. Give it a go.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well it is the longest running Sci-fi series going so they've had actors passing or wanting to move onto new roles. They normally let the actors keep being the Doctor for as long as they want. 

The basic story is this - The Doctor is an alien from a race of time travelers. He as a young man (by his race's standards) stole an old half broken time machine to explore the universe. He's fond of humans, as we look a lot like his race and of Great Britain. 

The Doctors don't tend to change that quickly normally you'll get 3 seasons or more out of each Doctor so it's pretty simple to follow. 

As for the 13 times, no one knows yet. That was something that was in the cannon before the modern reboot. Although they still keep the stories from the past connected the Doctor is now the last of his kind. Before the rebooted series there was a ""Time War"" between the Doctor's race and their greatest enemies the Darleks. 

This war resulted in the destruction of both races and sent ripple through time and space. That all sounds pretty fancy but basically it is a good way of wrapping up any loop holes or plot problems from the old series. As they can always start fresh with the old ""the time war changed everything"". Hence why it is pretty easy for new viewers to get into the new who series. You don't need to know any back story. 

The Doctor could have 13 regenerations or that might have all changed after the war. The series is about a man that changes time and history so anything is possible really. Nothing is too cannon in a series that goes about changing time... ",0,1331921126,null,0,false,0,c41q69b,t3_qzmlq,t1_c41q69b,t1_c41q1qr,null,1428537913,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

He was doing a Masters. He was perfectly within his rights to put forward alternate theories with evidence to back up his position. That of course would require reading, critical analysis and not flouncing off after 6 weeks or whatever it was.

He posts on here as [sexismbusters](http://www.reddit.com/user/sexismbusters). Some of his other thoughts on topics such as child marriage can be seen on his page (but not in the original threads where he has deleted them) are interesting... 

Tom speaks thusly about child marriages...

&gt;When they talk about child brides being cruelly 'sold', they never mention the marriage gifts for the little whores.

&gt;And when they talk about them being tricked into marrying an old guy, it is just like the stories about 'sex slaves' being tricked into it - a victim-feminist story which the Guardian itself proved to be just a story in 2009, when it found no sex slaves in Britain for instance.

&gt;We have to learn to call a whore a whore, whatever their age.


Doubtless he was just being 'satirical'.

Getting rid of a rank of recently arrived top heavy bureaucracy is a great way to cut down on bureaucracy.  Nor are they removing all bureaucrats and managers, more looking to balance their influence with medical professionals.

&gt;Just because someone is medically trained doesn't mean they know the first thing about management, 

Getting someone who already knows the system kinda does mean they know something about management.  That said the proposal will still have a Commissioning Board.

&gt; accounting,

Nobody is saying the accounts department should be removed.

&gt;dealing with procurement

Not only has NICE has been protected, they are looking to strengthen it.

&gt; Also, do we really want our doctors spending more time on management and less on actually practising medicine?

It's not every doctor, it's about appointing a few experienced doctors per region to a regional committee so they can act as direct representatives for real concerns of frontline service professionals.  Replacing PCTs with a single National Health Commissioning Board which will consult with the regional GP consortiums who will in turn consult with practicing GPs.

&gt;The professional bureaucrats provide vital support to the medics, and without them the NHS simply couldn't function/

So instead of bloated multiple CEOs and board members of numerous  Primary Care Trusts, all taking record salaries, and 10 Strategic Health Authorities, it is replaced by one national board that must work with smaller experienced GP balanced committees.

true,Rotgrub,null,null,"For crying out loud nobody is talking about converting to a US system and they certainly shouldn't be used for any meaningful comparison, yes there's damn well a lot more bureaucracy to the US system, but that's not any argument for the UK not to have less if it can do so.  In 1996 there were 8 regional executive offices and 100 Health Authorities.  By 2003 there were 28 health authorities and 303 Primary Care Trusts, even New Labour had to do an about turn on their own policy as wasteful and halve all the health authorities and PCTs they had introduced in the last 6 years, down to 10 and 150.  The NHS and media at the time were frothing at the mouth for blood over the top heavy system.    There's still going to be managers though even if these reforms go through as they are.  There's still going to be managers and administrators on the proposed GP committees too.  There's still going to be NICE.  There's still going to be a central UK commissioning board.  The Guardian article links to locums replacing during the set up, which will cost money, but the savings in the first 2 years, after the reform set up costs, will still be £5billion. 

I've criticised the reforms as they stand.  It needs protection putting in for the NHS to prevent a bleeding into the private sector, but the criticism should at least be realistic and address the actual proposals otherwise the criticism of it will ultimately be shot down for not being factual.

What does make sense is for a local consortium to address its particular, tailored needs.  Inner city surgeries are going to have different needs to a surgery out in the boondocks.   What doesn't make sense is having a 160 CEOs and a 160 different boards full of members, and where a local trying to exact changes is left whistling in the wind.  Would I rather have an experienced GP that's close to retirement and wants to cut down their surgery work load joining a small multiple constituency committee and directly approachable by other local service providers, effectively fashioning the budget to specific needs in a joint committee, as opposed to a PCT CEO and board drafted in from the private sector all on six figure salaries with little knowledge of what's happening at the front-line?  Yes please.

The idea that it's a matter of a 30k manager or a 90k doctor is specious when dealing with ending Primary Care Trusts.   The article says,
           
               ""But it costs the NHS up to £123,900 a year to 
                replace a GP with a locum. In one CCG area alone, 
                15 local doctors are each spending up to two days 
                a week away from surgery, at a cost of almost £1m 
                a year.""

Even putting aside this is part of the set up costs and the locum work will settle down, and putting aside I challenge anyone to find a manager working at a PCT for only £30k who does any real managing,   250 proposed areas across the country makes for £250 million.  That's presumably £500 million over 2 years.  The proposed savings, going directly back into the NHS is budget is £5 *billion*.  Put it another way, on average for a million an area spends on locum work to introduce the reforms it'll make a ten fold return for the NHS budget, money for  treatment and front-line services.  DEAL!

true,davegod,null,null,"Take up the uni provision for the first year. Easier for meeting some people initially and removes a big hassle of finding somewhere and other potential hassles with landlords etc. 

Especially as with private flats where the rooms are rented individually to foreigners the landlords tend to be a ""douchebag"". If you do go private, renting an entire flat as a group is much more preferable. Flat hunting is a chore and you do need to have experience of Edinburgh flats (and letting agents) to know what to expect and what to look for.  Many of the better landlords flatly say no students, but make it clear you're mature postgrads and many will okay it. 

The uni has both halls and flats for postgrads (referred to as catered &amp; self-catering). There's quite a bit of info [here](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/accommodation-services/new-prospective/postgraduate) so I'll just try to add things they don't say/aren't clear on.

The halls are all at the main ""Pollock Halls"" campus along with the undergrads. Hmm. The flats are spread about a bit but generally the uni owns the entire building and they'd usually be all postgrads. Halls probably higher concentration of people to meet though flats offer a bit more freedom. AFAIK all their accommodation is both fairly central and near the teaching buildings.  Pretty decent quality, many built or converted by the uni.

Note IIRC they kick you out over summer. I think that's the same for halls and flats. *Possibly* there's some special arrangement possible but I wouldn't bet on it since they make a packet renting out the halls for conferences and to festival-goers. Christmas &amp; spring holidays you keep your room but beware the ""catered"" halls stop serving food (though there's some shared kitchen sufficient for making snacks). Looking for accommodation here over the summer can be difficult due to the Festivals, many get rented out to tourists at *steeply* inflated rates. You should definitely do the fringe at least once.

Halls are a lot more expensive, but not sure how it works out once you account for food and bills in the flats. Even in the flats the bills won't be much - for example we had free basic heating but if you boost it warmer or for more hot water you're billed for that. Internet is included, dunno if it blocks piratebay or whatever. Unusually for the UK, you don't have clothes washing machines but a shared laundry, even with the flats. At first glance to cost of the flats is noticeably more than generally in Edinburgh, but due to the bills thing it probably works out only a little pricier unless you're happy with a crappy flat.

Moving away from accomodation, no worries about being ""an American"". Edinburgh is quite cosmopolitan - maybe not to NY levels but very much so for the size of the city. There's also a lot of tourists; foreigners do not stand out. It's waaaaay more relaxed than NY. It's not going to have NY level facilities. There's many really good pubs but very little in the way of nightclubs and you'll probably be visiting Glasgow if you go to gigs (an hour's train ride). You won't need a car.

I'll note I stayed with an New Yorker doing American History who came over for a year's exchange thing. Initially he moaned a *lot* about things being taught that were ""wrong"" but by the end he was figuring that maybe history was more of a pliable thing than he'd reckoned.

He can also do chemistry between characters *really* well. Nick Frost is Simon Pegg's companion, and by the end of everything they're in you love them both to death. That's what Doctor Who needs.

He's the most perfect man outside of the ghost of Douglas Adams I can imagine taking reign of Doctor Who and the best thing is that him coming on is fairly probable.

So firstly, it's fair that civil servants living in different parts of the country can live approximately equivalent lifestyles; if housing is twice the price in London, that extra money comes straight out of other income, and requires big compromises elsewhere. 

Secondly, and more importantly, if departments can pay people less in depressed areas of the country, it is a massive incentive for them to move employment there.

true,[deleted],null,null,"That's a very interesting story. I've always thought that perhaps the reason that some protestants in NI are so much more feverent in their British nationalism than people from Britain is because they have a very different conception of ""British-ness"". Britain experienced very high levels of immigration in the 20th century, with lots of people migrating to there from former British colonies. It's not the case that the new immigrants necessarily diluted the indigenous British culture, just that what it meant to be ""British"" became less about being born in the UK and more about things like having British citizenship, speaking English, respecting the laws, etc. It was a very *civic* understanding of Britishness, in a very multi-cultural society. In contrast NI, until very recently, did not receive much immigration at all. It's a very ethnically-homogeneous place. Being British there is more about being born into a certain blood lineage and tradition. It's a more *ethnic* understanding of Britishness, which is not as inclusive as the civic understanding. It would be very uncommon to see a foreign-born person marching in an Orangeman parade for example. 

That as well as the fact that being removed from the mainland, Loyalists see themselves in some sense as being an island surrounded by hostile forces, the most important of which being the Roman church. The result is an embattled-mentality and a feverent British nationalism unlike that of Britain.

true,ozmars,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"Favourites are tricky little things to pin down, at least for me, but here goes... 

DW is definitely one of my favourite shows, but not the only one.  B5 is another.  I loved B5 for long arcs, the fantastic writing, generally great acting and so on.  It was so good to have some sci-fi that wasn't Star Trek or X-Files which were often not really sci-fi, but more drama.  For me B5 trod the line nicely between being a drama and sci-fi.  To see some tricky issues explored (genocide, international - or rather inter-planetary - relations, corruption in government etc) in a space setting made me really happy.  I wouldn't necessarily say I prefer either one over the other, more that I tend to re-watch DW when I want something relatively light hearted and easy to jump in and out of.  B5 is something I tend to watch when I want to throw away several days sitting in front of the box thinking about bigger issues.  That's not to say that there aren't big issues dealt with in DW, but it tends to be less often and in a very different way due to the fact that it's a family show.  I have to say Torchwood is up there, though I don't know if that's just because of the DW connection or Captain Jack or the stories or...anyways.  For a good nostalgia hit of brit-com, I can't go past Red Dwarf, again sci-fi, but also very funny.  I still can't hear anyone referring to wanting to eat something without thinking ""I'm gonna eat you little fishies...""

Then there's non-sci-fi like Psych, which I watch just because it makes me laugh.  Or [Spicks and Specks](http://www.abc.net.au/tv/spicksandspecks/), a music quiz show with two teams, each made up of a regular team captain, and usually one comedian and one musician, hosted by a comedian [Adam Hills](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Hills).  Again, I like it because it makes me laugh and seeing as I seem to have a brain which collects pointless trivia, I may as well have fun with it sometimes.  The IT Crowd and Coupling are another two which I can always revisit for a bit of a laugh.  My SO and I can't hear anyone saying ""throw cushions"" without dissolving into hysterical laughter thanks to Coupling.

It all depends really on how I'm feeling, as to which I will revisit, atm we're almost done with B5 (again) and I'm planning on watching all the movies and Crusade with it.  The kids and I have been re-watching DW again, and we've been watching the Spicks and Specks re-runs on ABC2 as it's over now and the host and captains have moved on to other things.

true,ozmars,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"I enjoy Firefly, but B5 is a lot better IMHO.  It can be difficult to get into because one of the main characters in the first season (Captain Sinclair) is acted by an incredibly wooden actor, once it gets to the second season it's much better.  B5 tends to be much more thought provoking while still having some lighter moments.  The acting (aside from Michael O'Hare as Sinclair) is pretty damn solid and believeable.  The ships and aliens are all excellent and I still find some of the CGI scenes stand up to newer productions.  The writing's pretty awesome too, even in the end when they were told they were going to be cancelled after S4, so JMS started to wrap things up and then Warner Bros turned around and gave them another season.  

If you like a good bit of sci-fi it's definitely worth a go, but if you can't get into the first season, skip straight to S2E1 and go back and watch S1 once you've gotten into it.  I've heard people liken BSG or SG:U to B5 but that doesn't really do it justice, and a lot of the things that really irritated me about both of those, like the preachy-ness of BSG and the down right depressing nature of SGU aren't there.

* Knee injury ruining his pace. When you can't break away and play football the only way you've played for so many years, you have to deal with taking defenders head on, as well as dealing with defenders attempting to you muscle you out.

* Our system doesn't favour him at all. Whether it's a 4-3-3, or Matteo's 4-2-3-1 (Or whatever it is), being a lone striker doesn't help. He needs a partner to play off of.

* The pressure. You know that amount of pressure Lampard had with his penalty against Napoli? If he failed to score...It'd be game over? Torres has almost that same pressure, game in game out. Every time he gets subbed on, he has that 50million dollar price tag in his mind (every time he shoots or every time he touches the ball, he has this in mind). He doesn't want to disappoint the fans or the people that want him to succeed. Lets not forget that the media crucifies him every game...even if he's been on for 5-10 minutes. Every pre-game show I watch, or when the camera pans to Torres, the commentator refers to how many hours he's played without scoring.

Since you've mentioned it, I'm sure you know all about it, but I like it because it's such radical storytelling, in terms of television. The writers (producers) are extremely daring, and they pull it off so well.  

What other show has gone so far as to abandon its main characters for entire episodes, *entire seasons*, so as to develop new main characters? Resetting the entire universe so that *everything is different*, leaving the characters (and us) chasing the versions of themselves that we knew? Some people rag on Fringe as copying X-Files. They probably do, for some of the individual Fringe events themselves, but the story itself is something quite different.   

I love its complexity. I love how smart it is. I love how the rewatch value is so high. The show is brilliant storytelling. I even love the ""slow"" MOTW episodes because I appreciate what the writers are doing when they use those episodes to set the tone for the coming ones. I don't watch Fringe and look at it like any other TV show, Fringe is about telling a story with many layers to it. To me, it's like watching a novel.

You're right, no Terry McDermott is sinful. I tried to keep the team properly functional, i.e. no one out of position, proper full backs, proper wingers, sensible 4-4-2, not playing 4 or 5 forwards (although dammit, that *is* tempting...).

On reflection I might be tempted to drop Heighway and bring in McManaman, and maybe for the subs drop Callaghan (did I just say that?!?!?) and bring in Keegan, just because 7 year old me would be disgusted if I didn't. 

The other thing that I realised is just how good Graeme Souness was as a player. Forget the management side of things, but as a holding midfielder he was simply the best I've ever seen.  By a mile. Maybe you've seen Keane or Viera, they weren't even close. He had the same kind of time on the ball in midfield as Zidane had. It's probably the closest comparison I've seen. 

He could stop a game, put his foot on the ball look around, loft a pass onto a stamp. He RAN any midfield. His tackling was as ferocious as anything in the 1970s. And on top of all that, he was probably the most accurate shooter from outside the box I think we've ever had.
The's a nice video up on youtube [HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trDP0RZSX9E). It, rightly, focusses on his goals, but what they can't really show is just how dominant he was in midfield. My god, he was imperious.

Anyway, I think the biggest problem is housing more than anything. The older generations have all bought their houses and paid off their mortgages so they can reap the rewards of a healthy income and only bills as outgoings, as well as the benefit of the boom in housing prices that the government is protecting at all costs by government intervention rather than letting the free market take its course.

This unfortunately means that us young folk are stuck renting (at sky high prices, especially down here in London) and locked out of getting that first rung on the ladder because deposits demands from the banks, combined with the price of a house, are so prohibitively high.

I've also been involved to varying degrees with several permaculture and urban farming projects.  Anyway, penis comparisons over, suffice to say I'm not an idiot when it comes to food production, and I'm pretty realistic when it comes to yields. I've seen very high yields in tropical settings, I've also seen ridiculous claims, and I'm aware the science and experience is still lacking for temperate regions like the UK  But realistically, we're not talking about entirely eliminating supply chains, we're talking about shortening them and becoming less dependent on them, especially globally.

Although within the areas of the public sector I've worked there has been a massive pay gap with the private sector paying 20-30% more than the public sector equivalents. The argument was always made that the benefits narrowed the gap however, most of these benefits have been eroded over the past few years. 

The result has been that many of the good people left the public sector and went into industry. There was and is a major skills drain that shows no sign of stopping. To the government, they see every person who leaves as a success because it reduces the wage bill through ""natural wastage"" with no regard to the knowledge and skill that goes with it. I've not worked in the public sector for a number of years, but when I did they were already relying very heavily on contractors and consultants to fill these gaps (different billing line, so they can still hit their wage bill targets) at a huge expense. From what I understand, under the Tories this has continued to the point where it's at breaking point. 

Having said that, I worked in one part of the civil service (and then moved to the supplier side) and I know of other areas of the public sector where people are paid significantly more than their private sector equivalents.

true,Philomathematic,hartnell,Hartnell,"Not at all. It does happen that way for a lot of people, I'm sure (both love and the Doctor, which, incidentally, would make a really nice mini-episode title), but it is by no means the absolute rule.

Though (and this is me talking off the top of my head without any real stopping-to-think-about-it-ness) I might contend that the first Doctor to really hook you, regardless of whether or not he is your ""favorite,"" is still significant since that's the one who drew you in and brought you to where you are now. And that's certainly special.

Because, and here's where the thinking starts to catch up with the talking, the first story I ever saw was ""Genesis of the Daleks,"" but it wasn't till many years later that I officially started in with Eccleston's 9th Doctor. And from the moment that he appeared on-screen, big grin, big ears, and a wonderfully compelling ""Run for your life!"" I was hooked. Because I knew the basic premise to Doctor Who and had heard ever so many great things about David Tennant and the early murmurings of Matt Smith, so I knew there was much to look forward to. But what people had overlooked was how much there was to enjoy running with the 9th Doctor. He was an immediately intriguing and reassuring character, in my opinion.

Because the thing about the Doctor is that he's always the same, but with differences; there's something essential about him but the particulars are changeable. I can come up with a list of words to describe any given incarnation and they'll generally hold true for any other incarnation, but with shifts in emphasis. For example, one of my words for 11 is ""wise"" because of his capacity to say exactly the right thing at exactly the right moment; that's not to say that no other Doctor is wise, but that 11 particularly manifests that characteristic, in my view.

And so one of the words that I have that applies to all Doctors but particularly to the 9th, my first, is ""safe."" In spite of the weirdness of the universe, in spite of fleets of Daleks ready to burn the earth, in spite of Mrs. Tyler's doubts and his own, the 9th Doctor makes me feel safe in a way that no other Doctor quite captures.",0,1331997078,null,0,false,0,c41zrss,t3_r0fs5,t1_c41zrss,t1_c41wm4u,null,1428542499,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

While it is useful for a manager to have experience in the field, its very rare for a good manager to rise through the ranks - they are simply very different types of work.

Finally, Ministers are not handling day to day decisions anyway, that is for the permanent secretaries and their staff. A minister is closer to a chairman of the board, not the CEO of the company.

Watching those old episodes really opens up some aspects of the new series that have been carried over. And, of course, it's still Doctor Who, and what fan wouldn't want more of that.

But, if you dislike the original Star Trek, I imagine you won't like the old Doctor Who serials either. I'd say that they've aged in a similar way to Star Trek. They're a product of a different time, and occasionally it shows. 

If you want to check them out here are a few I would recommend:

* ""The Brain of Moribus"" (Fourth Doctor and Sarah Jane run around a planet with evil nuns, a mad scientist, and a certain disembodied organ)

* ""The Mind Robber"" (Second Doctor winds up a distinctly post-modern place outside of time and space where words have unusual power. Also, the TARDIS explodes.)

* ""The Time Warrior"" (Third Doctor fights a Sontaron in the Middle Ages with his new companion, Sarah Jane.)

* ""Earthshock"" (Fifth Doctor tries to stop a ship full of Cybermen that's headed straight for Earth, and winds up paying a terrible price.)

But, **don't watch the TV Movie**. It is unrelentingly awful. Eighth Doctor is a fine regeneration, but he can't save it. The plot is convoluted and poorly presented. They make the Doctor say he is half-human for some reason. Eric Roberts hams his way to being the worst version of the Master in history (even worse than the ~silver energy snake~ form he takes before stealing an Eric-Roberts-shaped body). And they give Seventh Doctor a terrible, pitiful send off.

But there's more! Here's the worst part about the television movie. It begins with the Daleks putting the Master on trial and executing him. But they grant his last wish that his remains be returned to Galifrey by the Doctor.

READ THAT AGAIN.

There is research evidence that regional pay for nurses actually *costs lives*.

I've always thought that this back story brings more mystery to the Doctor. If the wiki article is accurate, then they intended to bring more mystery to the character

Exactly how much more should a deputy head teacher be paid than an assistant HR Manager in a 300-strong company? Should the editor of The Guardian earn quite so much more than a fireman?

You can't dictate a whole load of pay levels. You have to let the market do it.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"I never thought I'd watch something so old and cheesy as classic Who. I had the belief that all tv before the 90s was useless. (Got a real slap in the face with ST: TNG). When I asked the friend who introduced me to DW if I'd have to watch the old stuff, I was so relieved with her answer. I said, ""Good! There's no way I'm ever going to watch *old* stuff."" Oh man.

As people have said, the pacing is slower, the effects cheesier, and yeah. That's about it. Lots of the stories match up to today's. There are *lots* of stories of classic I prefer over new Who ones. The true challenge in handling classic is the pacing and missing episodes (106 thanks to BBC junking policy in the 60s). Plus it will take lots of time to get over the lack of modern day overdramatization in characters' emotions and the storyline.

After I finished classic Who I wrote about the time spent, my feelings and how my views changed: http://Langue-Skulptur.deviantart.com/journal/I-did-it-It-took-,5-5-months-but-I-did-it-269455187

The **1996 movie** gets a lot of flak for 2 reasons.

1. It stomps on continuity. Well technically it doesn't (its never directly contradicted by previous stories) but it stomps on nearly every fan's view of the Doctor. But this has been worked around so there's no need to freak out.

2. It's really *really* 90s. Lots of forgiveness for the 90s. And its Americanized. As I watch it more and more, I get more okay with it. It's great when I don't want to watch new but also don't want to deal with the slow pacing of classic.

**As for getting into the classic series**...

First thing you do? Watch **Genesis of the Daleks**. It shows how good classic is and it's a good intro into getting the feel for old tv. And then I find that the best thing one can do is see 2 or 3 stories from each Doctor and then go through classic straight through. Watching a couple stories from all the Doctors is like building a road map before you actually take the journey itself. So here are some stories for each:

**William Hartnell, first**- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore. The Romans. The Tenth Planet (though the last part is reconstruction only, reconstructions are in place for the missing episodes).

**Patrick Troughton, second** - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. His era is mostly missing so its hard to get a grip his era. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

**Jon Pertwee, third**- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

**Tom Baker, fourth** The most famous run. There are so many fantastic stories. Genesis of the Daleks, one of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic. And Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

**Peter Davison, fifth** -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special, andCaves of Androzani!* (the last story)

**Colin Baker, sixth**- His Doctor is unique with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good.

**Sylvester McCoy, seventh.** Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis. This is the era where they really try some crazy radical stories.

**Note**: If you can find reconstructions that are accompanied by narration then your life gets much easier with them.

Traumatizing, scary. It's an excellent dialogue that utilizes the radio medium to its fullest and explores the romantic Doctor-companion relationship. One of the best done as well.

Jubilee (6th- don't be scared!) is what *Dalek* was based off of. Jubilee is different. It somehow manages to shed a new perspective on the Daleks and really shows them in a pure light. (not necessarily a positive one!) Totally stomps on *Dalek*. Can't be blamed- you get 2 hrs for this story instead of 45 min. The way the Daleks are portrayed is different in Jubilee and more sophisticated- less of this 'suddenly got emotions'.

Omega (5th), Master (7th) and Davros (6th). Part of a special villain trilogy which goes in depth for each of the three major villains. For a fan of any of these three, it's a total geek fest of awesomeness. If you don't care for them, you'll start to. I never cared for Omega but now he's such a 3 dimensional character!

Flip-Flop (7) and Holy Terror (6) are also a couple of very good stories! Flip Flop is timey wimey and 6's is..well I can't spoil it.

The Fires of Vulcan (7) I found particularly good. It's a pure historical (no aliens or anything!) and set in Pompeii (I know, you're thinking 'oh not again') but trust me! It's great.

Schroedinger's football fan. Sort of.

In all seriousness, it's going to take a serious points haul for Man U to beat us so there can't be any shame in it. Nor is there shame in having the record for the best start to a campaign and the joint record for the most consecutive wins (14 with Arsenal - during the ""Unbeatable"" era.)

However, these things will be forgotten if we do lose and the schadenfreude from gleeful fans of other teams will be palpable. That is a shame if you think about. What they are saying is they'd rather a very dull team of expensive millionaires win it than a team of more expensive, slightly richer millionaires that play (most of the time) strong attacking football with skill. Grit over quality.

You know when they said they want to see good football ? Yeah, it's absolute bollocks.

If you recall, in that episode, when Sherlock goes into talk to the little girl, she becomes hysterical at the sight of him.

Later in the episode, Sherlock enlists the help of the coroner. My assertion would be that since Moriarty didn't like loose ends, he ended up killing the Sherlock look-alike. When Sherlock enlists the help of the coroner, he is trying to locate his double. It is this dead double that I think Watson eventually finds on the sidewalk. I think that Sherlock jumped into the garbage (laundry?) truck, he pushed out his double's corpse. And if you recall, right as Sherlock jumps, a biker clips Watson, causing him to be delayed in reaching the scene.

A popular argument in favour of gay marriage is that currently homosexuals are being discriminated against. But I think that is inaccurate. A homosexual man has every right a heterosexual man has, the homosexual may marry a woman, the heterosexual man has no right to marry another man. Calling it discrimination is just incorrect.

A popular argument against gay marriage is the idea that marriage is exclusively between a man and a woman, usually to provide a stable family unit for raising kids. But the problem with this is that there are same sex couples who have and raise children, there is no evidence that it is harmful to children. So if marriage is for raising children, surly homosexuals should have the right to marry.

But ultimately I don't really see what the point is in legalising gay marriage. What is the difference between a civil partnership and a marriage? I would say almost nothing.

If you said one, then incorrect. The 45 year old man arrested was a bailiff working for the police who assaulted a photographer with a weapon, ran a red light whilst driving aggressively at pedestrians, hit more pedestrians after they chased him and stood infront of his car to take his license plate with police less than 20 metres away, then hit more pedestrians after the police let him go. The police refused to act not even taking any statements at the scene and told people to travel to a police station if they wanted to take things further.

You're stating that homosexuality is a choice? If that is the case, I'm sure you're aware that it seems no-one but religious people agree with you on that front. Most importantly, psychologists don't. Do you have any particular theory as to why that is, other than the ""It's political correctness"" argument?

&gt; I might chose not to like Egyptians

True, but the equivalent case would be you speaking out against Egyptians being allowed to get married to each other ""like normal British couples"", telling everyone that their nationality is unnatural and that they do not deserve equal treatment in law or society. The church is not benign in their treatment of homosexuals. It's not a case of live and let live. The church actively discriminates against homosexuals. If you think otherwise, I suggest looking at the religious exemptions to equality legislation that were campaigned for by various faith based organisations. A faith school, for example, can effectively discriminate against a teacher (or potential teacher) on the basis of their sexuality.

The church is chastised because it is the state religion with unique access to influence the government and the law. 26 Lords Spiritual: They're all male and all Anglican. If there were Muslims in the Lords saying and doing similar things then they'd be criticised just as much.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"First thing you do? Watch Genesis of the Daleks. It shows how good classic is and it's a good intro into getting the feel for old tv. And then I find that the best thing one can do is see 2 or 3 stories from each Doctor and then go through classic straight through. Watching a couple stories from all the Doctors is like building a road map before you actually take the journey itself. So here are some stories for each:

William Hartnell, first- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore. The Romans. The Tenth Planet (though the last part is reconstruction only, reconstructions are in place for the missing episodes).

Patrick Troughton, second - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. His era is mostly missing so its hard to get a grip his era. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

Jon Pertwee, third- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

Tom Baker, fourth The most famous run. There are so many fantastic stories. Genesis of the Daleks, one of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic. And Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

Peter Davison, fifth -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, 
Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special, andCaves of Androzani!* (the last story)

Colin Baker, sixth- His Doctor is unique with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good.

Sylvester McCoy, seventh. Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis. This is the era where they really try some crazy radical stories.

I love it when somebody has a perspective that I don't have, one that's the exact opposite of mine. I find it so brilliant!

Well I'd love to hear more about why you feel the way you do but may I first explain why I have the opinion I do.

I feel that unlike Star Trek, Doctor Who treats science as a formality rather than a real cornerstone. He says trans-dimensional time-shifting wormhole because the writers don't want to say magic door.

The entire premise of Doctor Who is silly. He's British, the box is British and for some reason all of space is British. He travels through time in a silly box and goes off on adventures. You try and make that serious and you will fail, because it quite simply is silly.

But if you embrace that fact, accept how utterly bonkers the concept is, than you can really have fun. I'm not saying toss all semblance of seriousness to the wind. I'm saying that the real source Doctor Who should look to is Douglas Adams, that all of this madness is really supposed to be about the characters and paralleling the complete absurdity of life to the extreme.

I agree that the characters, their development, making the audience really think and ponder is important if not the most important. But what I'm saying is that this should be dome primarily through comedy. You can be philosophical and deep and meaningful and still be hilarious.

I guess the only real parallel I can imagine is Futurama (although I obviously don't want Doctor Who to become a sitcom). It can make you roll over with laughter, but it has really moving moments. Jurassic Bark, Luck of the Fryrish, all moments throughout that really touch you and make you cry.

That's what I want Doctor Who to be like. I want it to be witty and clever and hilarious and willing to admit it's a joke but also be willing to get deep, be personal and really move me.

I want it to have drama, but it can't pretend that's what it is first and foremost because if it ever attempted that it would get laughed out of the theater. It's like wearing a clown suit and trying to do Hamlet.

true,germany_kyle,null,null,"Here are but a few of my suggestions for you:

Food: Sweet Melinda's in Marchmont &amp; The Newington Fish Bar. Melinda's is a really nice restaurant and the fish bar is a chippy but it is the only place in Edinburgh I've seen cook everything from scratch for you to take away. See also it has the crunchiest best fries ever!. 

Animals: Edinburgh Zoo would be your best bet for animals, we have pandas now but of the black &amp; White variety the Tapirs are my favourite. 

History: You can't really walk anywhere in Edinburgh without bumping in to some historical building/place. I like The Georgian House, Surgeons Hall Museum and The Botanic Gardens are particularly stunning in spring/summer.

Nerdisms: As far as nerdisms go I would recommend a visit to Pulp Fiction, it's a great book shop in the city centre just off Lothian Road, If you like tabletop role playing games there's a tiny little independent games shop near the meadows. If you like vintage clothing there are about 3 Armstrongs Vintage Clothing shops around Edinburgh (very reasonably priced and usually great places to even just go look around) If you like literary events then send me a pm and I'll give you the deets on some cool events that are on whenever you are here.

Theatre: The Festival Theatre is usually a good bet, The Traverse has some good stuff on usually. I recommend checking out Scottish Opera's schedule to see what they're up to this season, see also the ballet and the RSNO is pretty spectacular as well. 

Curiosities: On the curiosities side I have one silly little one for you. If you go to the Merlin pub on Morningside Road, once you've had your obligatory pint, head out the front door then start walking to your right down the street past the library to a corner where a Santander bank stands, turn right again and walk till you see an archway on your right, walk through said archway and enter western town. It was made by a builder who owned the lot and I don't know how much longer it will be there anymore with all this new development crap around there. Basically it's an old spaghetti western set. It's pretty much my favourite random place in Edinburgh.

Hope you enjoy your trip!

&gt;*Working class living standards have already regressed below where they were more than 30 years ago. According to a report by the New Policy Institute, the share of gross domestic product (GDP) going to wages has fallen from 58 percent in 1978 to 53.8 percent today*

No: even if wages have fallen expressed as a share of GDP, as GDP has risen over the last 30 years, that does not mean that living standards have 'regressed below where they were more than 30 years ago'. This is written by someone who's economically and arithmetically incompetent. And/or very dishonest.

It's well to be wary of common sense but there's still a smell test to claims like this. Does it seem plausible to you that living standards are *below* what they were &gt; 30 years ago? What does the author mean by 'living standards' anyway?

true,Dr_Cptn_Blackman,tardis,TARDIS,"Absurdism is not quite the same as comedy. Yes Doctor Who can be viewed as merely silly stories and clever banter, but for the viewer who sees these 'silly' madcap things as something more, as allegories, and archetypes, it becomes a much more intelligent show than a silly show. 

I'll admit I've not watched the classic, but since the reboot the show has undeniably been billed as a drama. A drama with lots of action and laughs along the way, but a drama nonetheless. Doctor Who is an epic by it's very nature, and hence a drama by the same standard. 

Calling Doctor Who a silly comedy is like calling The Hobbit a comedy. The humor is integral, but only to build bonds between the characters and viewers, and between the character's themselves. 

In all honesty, like many things these days, is genera bridging. If I were to give it's genera a name it would be Epic Space Opera Dramedy.

And in such genre bridging amalgams, and as in all art really, the nature of the work is in the eye of the beholder. Weeds, Californication, Entourage, three shows billed as dramedies. All have humor, and drama. They are both genre's, and that's intentional. It's up to the viewer how serious to take it.

With Doctor Who, the emotional investment is so great that the comedic value pales in comparison, as brilliant as it is, it's never the jokes I remember, it's the moving and thought provoking aspects that stay with me, and draw me in again and again and again.

Well that can't be the real reason - Ireland doesn't have Sunday trading laws and as a country they're a whole lot more religious than the UK.

I agree it should be permanent. It's ridiculous that it hasn't happened already. The only arguments I hear against it, such as those within this thread are, ""I would like a day of rest"" in a sort of idealistic but assuming the worst kind of way. People won't be forced to work 7 days a week.

There are enough laws already governing shift work and hours of work, give people the choice. If they want to work on Sunday then let them, stop pushing your restrictive ideals on to those who want to do something.

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; theological differences 

I'm not sure anyone can argue with that. I wasn't implying there'd be armed conflict if religions were left to their own devices, however we don't even have to look outside UK borders for current examples of violent conflict between (even subtly) different faiths. Whether or not you agree that it is due to their faiths is moot, to a degree.

Am I saying that ""the default position"" is 'war'? Hell no. Most people - *most* people - are not aggressive and not so fearful of their opinions being criticised/undermined that they have to silence the opposition, or get so upset that they need to hurt people when their religion is offended.

But the term ""enemy"" does not have to mean that violence will ensue. Look at the recent grumblings between the Anglican community and the Catholic church, as an example that even very similar religious groups will not simply ""live and let live"". The CC is poaching members and priests over women priests or the 'issue' of the acceptance of homosexuality, for example. Back in the 90's many people switched over to the CC over women priests (look at Anne Widdecombe for a 'good' example) and only last year or so a number priests/Bishops have gone over too. Examples: [1](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11709148), [2](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12260569) The CC openly offers (homophobic?) clergy a 'way out' and it was made easier to switch back in 2009, but some in the Anglican community are [happy about that](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/21/catholic-defectors-anglican-relief-bishop).

Also I chose to use the phrase ""enemy of my enemy"" because, if you look at the way in which various religious groups are ""warning"" about secularism, it's fairly clear that the hierarchies think ""some faith"" is better than none. [Pope warns about secularism](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/the-pope/8006272/Pope-Benedict-XVI-warns-against-aggressive-secularism-in-Britain.html). Anglican [warns against secularism/move to 'combat' it.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9151438/Anglican-schools-to-expand-to-combat-secularism.html) I don't think I even have to link to Warsi's comments recently.

My point? I stick by my initial comment, though perhaps should have made it clear that not every religious person wants to destroy every other religious person.",0,1332083281,null,0,false,0,c429se6,t3_r1cgb,t1_c429se6,t1_c428vff,null,1428547310,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"It's funny because even though Prisoner Zero manages to say some of the vague lines that got turned into plot-arcs I feel that Prisoner Zero's story actually highlights some of the inconsistencies.

In The Eleventh Hour the cracks are ""two sections of space and time that should have never met"" and act as a portal between a prison and Amy's bedroom.

But later in the season the cracks are portrayed as rifts of temporal energy, not portals connecting space and time and suddenly going through them erases you from existence.

It's just these sudden changes in how things work that make the plot Moffat's made seem ill-planned and improvisational.

To go more in-depth I'll use spoilers so as not to ruin the seasons for those who've not seen them:

[](/s ""One of the most obvious displays of sudden untangling of plot snarls is in A Good Man Goes to War and Let's Kill Hitler where River's backstory is revealed. In AGMGTW River's origins are explained through lengthy exposition and the premise is absolutely ludicrous: She's a Time Lord made by fucking in the TARDIS. She's then kidnapped by the Silents and as a child is sent back in time to warn the Nixon about the Silents and undermine their plot (why they would do that, we have no idea) and is then shot by Amy (was she? I thought Amy missed that shot) and then regenerates in New York, 1969 into a black toddler named Mels (Melody, have no idea how she learned her name or why she kept it) and then is somehow transported to Amy and Rory's hometown where she grows up with them. At some point during this she is hypnotized to kill the Doctor."")

Now already that's a ridiculous snarl of plot right there, much of the connecting events make no sense and vital pieces of information are missing like [](/s ""what the hell were the Silents doing and what's their motives,"") or [](/s ""why they blew up the TARDIS."")

And then when we move onto [](/s ""Let's Kill Hitler it just gets more ridiculous. We have Mel, a character who is supposedly Amy's best friend but is someone we've never seen before (which itself just reeks of having just been thought up and not planned ahead in the slightest) going up to the Doctor GUN IN HAND (mind you, she's supposed to be programmed to kill the Doctor) and then instead of shooting him dead right there, decided to go kill Hitler for NO REASON other than for the title to make sense. Why would River want to kill Hitler? And then when she actually does try to kill the Doctor she backs out and gives him all her future regenerations (so that she's not a Time Lord when we see her die)."")

Overall Moffat's seasons have been [](/s ""setting up one plot arc, aborting it and moving onto a new one. Season Five was all about the cracks and the TARDIS exploding. We didn't get any answers explaining that. Season Six was all about the ""death"" of the Doctor and the Silents (both of which are backed out of and not committed to). He'll just move on to the next big thing without even explaining what he left behind, and it bugs me. It's been two seasons and he still hasn't explained why the TARDIS blew up. That's really unacceptable."")

Malungos Edinburgh was established by a group of friends in 2010 under the guidance of Contra-Mestre Pedigree, Professors Galinha and Cuca and our instructors here. Our group is run by volunteers, just for the joy of the game, so we try to keep classes as cheap as possible.

Regarding polling statistics, whilst it may not appear to be the case, a 35% response rate [is perfectly acceptable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate).

I wouldn't say I am against the bill for ideological reasons - as I said, i'm no expert on health care provision but I'm looking at what the experts are saying and it is their opinions that give me cause for concern. In the same way that I listen to my doctor if he tells me I'm ill, I will listen to him when he tells me the NHS reform bill is wrong. Perhaps those opposed to the bills are purely more vocal?

As for withholding the bill because it gives people ammunition - I really hope that isn't his reason. This is a democracy and those are our tax £'s being spent on that register - To withhold it so that the Royal Colleges etc can't review it and make a case is plain wrong. This is purely a risk assessment of what can happen during the reorganisation set out in the health bill - we have a right to know the risks so that we can make up our own opinions accordingly. Add to this the fact that NHS reforms were barely muted during the election campaign and none of this is coming off as particularly democratic.

From the link I provided:

&gt;Labour's decision to boost health spending while in office saw it reach a record 9.3% of GDP, but this remained less than in Germany (10.7%) or the US (15%).

Bertrand - looked AMAZING. Made some fantastic runs and should have been fed more. I am pretty confident in him replacing Cole as a career Blue. To be fair, he didn't really have a whole lot of intense defending to do, but he looks just as dangerous, if not more, than Cole does right now. 

Sturridge - As technically brilliant as he is he needs to pass the fucking ball. As much of a CF as he thinks he is he needs to learn to put the team first. He's young, yes, and still learning certainly. But RDM needs to have a chat with the lad, player to player, and tell him what's up. Until then he's more detrimental than useful on the pitch as when he has the ball nobody knows where he's going or whether to even consider making runs. 

Cahill - Pure class. What a celebration and great goal. 

Kalou - looked dangerous when on the pitch and is certainly making a case for himself. 

Mikel - had a notably poor performance, in my book. Was sloppy/way too casual in defense and almost gave up several balls in a bad spot. Essien was WAY better on the pitch and looked the brighter and more creative CM. 

Malouda - better than we've seen him in the past. Lots of movement, and had some good shots too.

But what is the point of divorce law? Surely it is not simply to dissuade divorce. Surely it is also to ensure that all parties are dealt with fairly. So if some adults decide to practice polygamy or polyandry for some reason, and then the 'marriage' breaks up, would it not be beneficial for divorce law to be applied, especially if children are involved.

It just seems to me that, if a significant number of people are going to consider themselves to be in a certain relationship, the law should recognize that such relationships exist. It doesn't need to encourage them, just have precedents to follow concerning them. Either with rules for when they break up, like with normal heterosexual monogamous couples, or a blanket ban, as with incest.

It's not as though there will not be legal fallout from breakups of non-standard relationships. If children are involved, matters concerning their care must be determined.

Existing contract law, perhaps?

Perhaps: but I think - given the rather sexist culture in which polygamy applies (and of course it's not Islam-wide, but rather an Arab / African practice) I'm not sure we should be rushing to change the law in this regard.

[Going along with the last two season finales, both centred very much around the Doctor.](/spoiler)

[The Tardis exploding, the Silence Will Fall echoing around as it does so and causing cracks through out time.  Those who have seen the Season 6 finale will know what the message means.  The question must not be asked.  Who benefits from his name not being known?  The Doctor.](/spoiler)

[Why you ask?  Well, his name has always been shrouded in mystery, never to be known, he never utters it.  It is said on the day his name is told, he cannot lie.  The Fall of the Eleventh is also mentioned, but does this need to be a literal term?  Perhaps it means his downfall from greatness, his descent into madness/darkness, and things are going to get very dangerous for him and those around him.](/spoiler)

[Now what happens after this is a mystery, but this could lead to the Doctor having to change his own timeline, cause his own death so the question will not be asked.  Throughout the series we have been told a fixed point cannot be altered.  But as River said, it can be.  Who told her that?  Who tells her anything!  The Doctor.  At the time this is his oldest carnation we have seen, so it is likely an older version of the Doctor has had more adventures with her, and has told her this, or she has witnessed it herself.](/spoiler)

[Now take into account the previous two finales, one has been about the end of the Universe, everything falling apart on the day that he picked up Amy to go traveling, after being 12(?) years late from his original crash.  Something caused the Tardis to be thrown of the time line, causing him to choose that exact date which coincides with him being placed into the Pandorica.  Who knows what day he would be placed into the Pandorica?  The Doctor.](/spoiler)

[Now the Silence are shown to be powerful, but powerful enough to control the Tardis itself?  Not likely.  Only one man we know can master the Tardis, and as shown in Amy's Choice, things can alter the very meaning of reality to the characters through the Tardis, which then caused a dream manifestation of the Doctor to appear.  A trickster of a man.](/spoiler)

[I believe the Doctor is going back to stop the Fall of the 11th from happening, so that his name will be safe, and that himself and the universe is safe.](/spoiler)

true,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"Having a market forces for NHS providers is a crazy idea. First of all if you are seriously ill, in pain, in an emergency or dying you are hardly in a position to make a choice about who gives you care. Even if you are well enough to make a choice then how is the patient, or the customer as they will soon be known, supposed to make an informed choice about who to treat an illness or injury? It's hard enough shopping for a new laptop, and the worst case scenario there is you end up with an expensive paperweight. If you open up the health service to ""any willing provider"" and the ""customer"" ends up choosing the wrong one they could die. Thirdly for there to be real choice there needs to be excess capacity, to be able to choose where to be treated there needs to be several hospitals in the local area with extra beds so that the ""customer"" can choose between them. This means the system would have to be inefficient, there would always have to be many more hospital beds available than there are patients to fill them and I don't know where this extra investment is supposed to come from given how stretched our health service is at the moment.

As for private companies profiting from the taxpayer there is many ways this could happen. Private companies can now pay hospitals to use their beds rather than having to build their own hospitals. Private companies will be able to cherry pick who the treat and then give them the minimum amount of treatment required to get their payment from the government. And clinical commissioning groups will have complete control on what should and should not be provided by the NHS in their area, so if they decide not to provide certain services then this opens up a whole now market to private health providers of people who previously got health services for free how now have to pay for them.

No, the Secretary of State still have a duty to ensure provision.

However: provision occurs within budget limits. Always has. It's why I can't get [**Biologics**](http://www.rheumatology.org/practice/clinical/patients/medications/biologics.asp) and have to make do with [**Methotrexate**](http://www.rheumatology.org/practice/clinical/patients/medications/methotrexate.asp). A significant difference is who makes these decisions. Clinicians at the local level who understand the needs of their patients: or bureaucrats far removed from clinical decisions.

Then you just need to pick out a light or dark blue shirt (brown suit) with a brown tie or light blue or purple/dark red (blue suit) with a red or purple tie

Converse, you can either go with the main brand (Tennants were off-white converses, I believe they sell as 'cream' these days. They're not the optical whites, but if you wear the opticals for about a month they'll grubby up a bit).

Or you can just buy a shop brand that looks similar. 

Sonic screwdrivers? Think geek/amazon.etc 

You can get good Tennant style glasses frames from most opticians (they'll have something close, probably not exact). 

3D glasses I tend to think just come across as... 'Tacky'? Not sure if thats the right word.

It could be a sort of a Valeyard type entity, as the subject this started of on was the Timelord Triumphant, the last Timelord, but this is speculation.



Now, when the Doctor regenerated from 10 to 11, it was powerful, it ripped apart the tardis, regeneration energy spread through the Tardis.  Perhaps the Doctor split in two, pointing at the [the two times so far that the Doctor has had a clone of sorts in Season 6](/spoiler), and the Doctor inside the Tardis, the Dreamlord, is controlling the Tardis from within.  This however is a little confusing with the Doctor's Wife, but perhaps when the Tardis exploded he escaped through the cracks in time, to where he created the Silence.

What made it explode is a confusing answer, but remember the Silence can only be remembered when seen, so who knows if they haven't been around before.

To put limits on freedom of speech is to fly in the face of the very idea of it. The whole premise of the right to freedom of speech is to allow somebody to express something without fear of repression, and if you're going to disallow saying certain things because people at large don't agree with it, regardless of how 'Universally frowned upon' it is (yet still an entirely subjective view), then why have the right in the first place? If a bunch of idiots want to burn poppies on November 11th, let them be ridiculous. If the EDL want to spout race hate on twitter, nobody is forcing anyone to read and accept it.

That is how I feel. Unfortunately, the world is not perfect, and is also populated with morons. When it comes to actively promoting violence, standing in the street with a megaphone and urging people to murder the queer infidel, that's where the debate comes into a grey area. Not everyone has the restraint and presence of mind to ignore it or just tell him to shut it, and people will end up getting hurt. This is where we have to recognise the distinction between hate speech and incitement to violence. 

Personally, I think arresting a man for talking a load of racial bollocks about Fabrice Muamba on Twitter from his home a hundred miles away is an absolute abomination to the concept of free speech. Nobody with any sense is going to agree with it, less are going to even read it, and nobody is having their rights violated apart from maybe getting upset about it. As retarded as this guy's views are, they're still *his views* and he has a right to express them.

If he was saying that Fabrice Muamba and all black people should be strung up, then it's different. I'm still deciding for myself what the consequences of incitement to violence would and should be in a free society.",0,1332102385,null,0,false,0,c42cn5u,t3_r29tw,t1_c42cn5u,t3_r29tw,null,1428548782,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9
true,pikeybastard,null,null,"This is one aspect of the bill that I don't understand people objecting to if they make an effort to investigate that aspect of policy. Bringing elements of market reform, decentralising commissioning, and encouraging both local administration and private capital and companies to enter the service has, with Foundation Hospitals and Trusts- with certain caveats- been a success, and is a factor that some analysts think helped improve NHS efficiency and quality of care after many of the wastage issues of the 90's and early 00's. 

Also, many studies (again, with apposite counter-arguments) indicate that competition improves patient care and outcomes: http://cep.lse.ac.uk/textonly/_new/news/Summary_of_NHS_Policy_Research_Papers.pdf , for example.

The issue that I have with this bill is that it very much strikes me as a badly drafted bill, typical of a party that has lost the skills of government, having been in opposition so long. Again, like Obama's health reform, I think that part of the issue is a vulnerable executive biting off more than they could chew- this level of reform is frankly not possible with a weakened coalition- it's the sort of reform that only mid-80's Thatcher or late 90's Labour could have implemented. It is because it is badly drafted and contested policy that I think it should be dropped.

The thing that has frustrated me personally about opposition to the bill, however, is that much of the anger seems manufactured- as in people are angry because they *should* be angry, but haven't done the reasoning or reading as to *why*. In discussing the issue with a couple of friends who went to heckle Lansley at a talk he was giving, other than saying 'they're privatising the whole NHS' (which isn't strictly true)  and quoting that one poll where- what was it, something like 30% of Doctors responded (?- not sure exact take up, can't find stats on it, so my figure is HIGHLY anecdotal, so very challengable!), thus skewing the results massively in favour of those opposed rather than balanced regarding the legislation, they knew nothing about the bill other than that the volume and temperature of protest was high.

I think the bill should be dropped, but I find it troubling that the reasons why will be bad reasons, and I find it strange that Labour are so viscerally opposed to a bill that in many ways extends their own policies and conclusions regarding the long term viability of the NHS, and its improved efficiencies. Much of it does smack as political opportunism by making reductive claims about a bill that is too convoluted for the public to really weigh up empirically, by playing the 'save the NHS card' as nothing else has stuck on the coalition from them yet. I also think that were these reforms led by Labour, rather than the Tories, many people wouldn't bat an eyelid, showing that it isn't necessarily the quality of the proposals that are under review, but merely a protest by the politically aligned against Conservative 'branding' if that makes sense.

Sorry for the novel guys!

I hear free speech and I think politics. A person should not be stifled by any organisation or other person from furthering a cause they believe in, even the BNP. That's what I think of when I hear free speech. Not the freedom for individuals to insult other individuals.

The grey area comes when the law tries to interpret what is and isn't insulting. If I say I'm against the Church having a hand in women's sexual health legislation and start a ""Keep the Church out of politics"" campaign the risk is some religious person takes offence. They may even see me as someone trying to stifle *their* free speech!

If we say it's against the law to insult people there will be incidents where the interpretation comes into conflict with genuine freedom of speech situations.

What people need to understand is there are real world consequences to words. If I walked down the street screaming ""I hate white people...the white man is the devil!"" I'm likely to, depending on who's out there, get myself into a physical fight. It's like shouting ""fire"" in a packed cinema. Freedom of speech has to consider the wider consequence of unfettered speech.

The Twitter guy? I don't know...can we really start making different laws based on technology? He wouldn't be able to make racist comments in the street, so how is Twitter any different as a public space? Again there's the question, should he be able to make racist comments in the street. I would go back to the real world consequence thing. Since Princess Diana Britain has been in this weird shared grief place.

Take the farcical example of the [Trustee Savings Bank](http://www.solhaam.org/articles/tsb.html), owned by its depositors according to everyone but the State's courts, but seized by the neo-lib pseudo free-marketeers in the '80s.  Thatcher and co had a funnily one-sided idea of property rights, like most of their ilk. Then, after being declared as State property, the Tories gave the business away to their mates in the ""private"" sector.  The government paid for the costs of the sale, and the buyers received back the money which they bought it with in the increased capitalisation of the asset they purchased.  

So, even if you accept the shenanigans by which they finagled an extremely well-run, popular and successful mutual away from the ordinary working people and their communities who were its beneficial owners by having it declared the property of the State, they then proceeded to give that State property away for free, costing the hard working British taxpayers about 3.5 billion quid in today's money, over half what Brown is supposedly on the hook for for selling all that gold at a low - something the right wing press never stops bleating about.  And this is just one small privatisation.  Imagine the scale of the graft involved with the NHS and you can see why big money interests intend for this to happen.  It's a very big earner.

I think the plan is to allow them to raise up to 49% *of income* from private provision. Foundation hospitals core legal duty will still be to care for NHS patients so they will not legally be able to 'drop non-private patients' in that way. The current amount allowed is around 2% but some specialist hospitals are much higher - the Royal Marsden, routinely rated as one of the best in the NHS - raises 30% of its income from private work.

Quote from the Beeb

&gt;*But the chief executive of the health thinktank, the King's Fund, Chris Ham said hospitals had generated funds from private patients for many years, and it was possible to provide high quality care to both NHS and private patients in the same hospital.*

&gt;*""The cap is only a significant consideration for a minority of hospitals,"" he said.*

&gt;*""These hospitals should report annually on how they are ensuring NHS patients do not lose out if the cap is either removed or at a relatively high proportion of income.""*

&gt;http://www.rcseng.ac.uk/policy/health-bill-timeline/

There was no need to 'sigh' at me - I had previously discounted the Surgeons as supporters because, far from supporting the bill they actually condemn it.

&gt;Surgeons have condemned the coalition's NHS shakeup but stopped short of demanding the scrapping of the health and social care bill.

&gt;By a majority of 101 to 70 they agreed that the bill would ""damage the NHS and widen healthcare inequalities, with detrimental effects on education, training and patient care in England"". [source](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/mar/09/royal-college-surgeons-nhs-reforms)

If a college *only* condemning the bill, is the best example of support you can find, I would suggest you have lost your case. 

&gt;That's for consumer surveys. Clearly, with such a politicised Bill, those motivated to respond would be far more likely to be opposed in principle.

I disagree - with the uproar that this bill is receiving I would imagine everyone is equally motivated to have their voice heard. Anyway, if you actually read that article I linked to you will see that it gives reference to studies that say it is a perfectly acceptable figure whether it be consumers or not.

&gt;It's the same source as yours.

Source and reference are different things. I only linked to Politics.co.uk because it had a relevant article *which cited references*. The article you linked to was 2 peoples *opinions*. Opinions are very different to references and reports. 

As I said, I'm purely unsympathetic to this new bill because the experts seem to be - it's nothing ideological. You have shown no experts in support of it - not one - let alone enough to make me reconsider my views.

""The old statism was at least mitigated by incompetence. The people in charge of it were paid too little to feel really important; and much of their energy was absorbed in disputes with stupid or malevolent union leaders. They presided over a system that was never very strong, and that failed to weather the storms of the 1970s.

As reconstructed in the 1980s – partly by the Adam Smith Institute – the new statism is different. It looks like private enterprise. It makes a profit. Those in charge of it are paid vast salaries, and smugly believe they are worth every penny….

But for all its external appearance, the reality is statism. And because it makes a profit, it is more stable than the old. It is also more pervasive. Look at these privatised companies, with their boards full of retired politicians, their cosy relationships with the regulators, their quick and easy ways to get whatever privileges they want….

As with National Socialism in Germany, the new statism is leading to the abolition of the distinction between public and private. Security companies, for example, are being awarded contracts to ferry defendants between prison and court, and in some cases to build and operate prisons. This has been sold to us on the – perfectly correct – grounds that it ensures better value for money. But it also involves grants of state powers of coercion to private organisations. All over the country, private companies are being given powers of surveillance and control greater than the Police used to possess.

In reality they have transferred the debt and spread it out over the next 20 to 30 years when those people start to claim their pensions. 

It works well enough for the people of the royal mail as their pension scheme is now guaranteed by the government. It works well for the government as it can essentially spend that pension money now and pay it off over the next 20+ years. It works well for a potential buyer for the Royal mail as they do not have this massive pension debt hanging over them upon purchase (they buy royal mail and they still have to pay those pensions otherwise).

In theory the government stands to make money from the sale of Royal Mail, in probable reality a tiny few will get rich from it, the profit margins will be upped and the service will suffer to satisfy shareholder demands. The government wont make as much from the sale as it is actually worth, but they make some money that they can spin as a huge gain for everyone. 

The only people really left scratching their heads are the rest of us, who have lost a public asset (however unprofitable) and gained a public debt (over 20-30 years that pension liability is likely to be more than £28bn). 

Of course if everyone due to draw a RM pension dies first, and the private sector firm that ends up running the RM invests heavily in infrastructure while cutting profit margins and banking on the long term viability of the service  - then as a nation we might come out on top.

To clarify: A church can still function as a church even if they can't perform weddings.

I'm sure there are many religious people (and otherwise of course) who don't particularly like interracial couples, but if they were to attempt to discriminate against such people/couples *outside* a church, would you argue that they have a right, as it is their religious beliefs, not to treat such a couple equally?

Private sector provision doesn't seem to work well here. The Independent Sector Treatment Centres have been very poor value for money. Even Norman Tebbit is against them.

Superficially this is surprising, because private sector provision works well in Holland. But when you look at the number of MPs (including the Secretary of State for Health) who are bankrolled by private health companies, it's clear this is never going to work in the UK.

My biggest objection to the bill is the unnecessary rush. The NHS isn't overpriced and it isn't broken. There's plenty of time to get reforms right. But this isn't happening. 

And my anger is because of the lobbying by the health providers. This is crony capitalism at its worst. It will take taxpayers' money and give it to the owners of companies that will deliver a worse service.

For some reason I've got that scene with Bruce Willis in Die Hard and the 'A sign' running through my head with that statement. Maybe extreme, but it evokes the point I suppose.

Why shouldn't we be able to wear, express *or say* what the fuck we want without reprisal from people who take exception to it?

And don't get me wrong. I hear no end of racist remarks, innuendoes and undertones up here; and sometimes find myself wondering what kind of world we live in where someone throws the bathwater out whilst dismissing perfectly valid points under the veil of racism.

My posts into this topic have - largely - been sober but unconvinced by the visceral responses of those writing against the Bill. I think the NHS needs reform, and I don't think these reforms are 'privatisation' or anything like it.

For venturing this unpopular but not completely unreasoned opinion I've been downvoted, mostly without comment, downvoted massively.

Your expression of disagreement in downvoting, while not Reddiquette, is perfectly understandable -  although I do wish more of you had ventured an argument.

The upshot of your downvotes, though,  is that Reddit's automated controls have kicked in and I'm massively limited now in how frequently I am able to post to this entire Subreddit. it's basically impossible for me to enter into a conversation with any of you.

So I'm unsubscribing from this Subreddit because I'm no longer able to participate in it properly.

A word of caution to you. If you don't want this Subreddit to become an unchallenging and unthoughtful echo chamber, be careful about downvoting just because you disagree with someone. Otherwise you're going to end up with something like r/politics.

You think most people share your views on topics like this? Could be. Could be that other voices can't be heard.
