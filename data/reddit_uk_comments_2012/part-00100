That's an average 3+ places ahead of us in the table, and Champions League football every season. Their manager is one of the legends in the game, with a reputation for developing quality players, who many players would love to work with. Ours is promising and has potential, but isn't an established name yet.

Equally, we're not guaranteed to return to CL football anytime soon either; if we'd come, say, 5th and only a few points off 4th last season, then perhaps we'd attract better quality players.

Nuri Sahin has won the Bundesliga and La Liga in his past two seasons; Cazorla has been 4th in La Liga in his past two. Even if the Premier League is a tougher/more competitive league, Liverpool would, harshly and sadly, be a step down for them. 

And all of that is before we consider whether we can accommodate these players in our wage structure - and with the likes of Cole, Aquilani and Carroll on our books, players who are all overpaid, we probably can't. Equally, Rodgers has decided our team needs approx 4 new first-team players; the money required to sign both of these would probably be equal to or more than his entire budget.

We can't compare ourselves with Arsenal or United in the transfer market anymore, and we never should compare ourselves with City or Chelsea. We need to look at what Spurs did and what Newcastle did - buying quality players for below their true value, or developing previously average players into quality ones.

true,epemberton,yorkshire,People's Republic of South Yorkshire,"&gt;I find it hilarious that somehow you think that life should be fair. Some people are born fat, thin, clever, stupid, good looking, ugly, rich, poor. Life isn't meritocratic.

I'll give you Good Looking (although for a sum the ravages of ugliness can be corrected in later life).  To say that all of the others are pure accidents of chance delivered upon us by the whims of an uncaring universe is quite staggeringly myopic.  Human society is shaped by the thoughts and actions of humans, and shapes those within it in return.  And all of the qualities you listed are shaped, in whole or in part, by society.  'Life' may not be meritocratic, but we have absolutely no excuse to ensure that society is, as far as is possible, a level playing field.

As to the accusations of jealousy, I find it is a telling way to establish when someone is unable to view the world without looking at it through the prism of their own self interest.  See Mittens Romney and his accusations of 'The Politics of Envy', a prime example of a man who is so unable to detach from his own view that a life well lived comprises entirely of personal enrichment that he can not imagine how others could think any different.

I agree with you about Boris being the sort who does well in the wankier elections (in a sort of Faragey/Gaollowayish sort of way) so I started wargaming the 2015 General with Boris as Tory leader. At first glance I thought 'Yeah, Boris would get creamed'. After all, if things pan out as I think they will, this will be a single issue election all about the economy. People will be looking for competence over excitement while the Tory brand will be so utterly battered that Christ himself probably wouldn't be able to swing a majority for them - hence not a cat in hell's chance for Boris.

But that didn't feel right and something kept niggling me. Eventually I realised what it was: Boris pushes a button that has some weird, voodoo like effect on the English. I don't know what it is but we seem to have this weird genetic vulnerabilty for a certain type of buffoon and that buffoon is Boris. I can't put my finger on what it is about him that get's us all weak at the electoral knees but it - combined with his unpredictability - is very potent to the point that I can't write him off.

In fact, the only solid conclusion I came to was that if he did run and lose, it would be because of something *he* did rather than any action from the opposition. He's scarily impervious to cross-party mudslinging whilst also being a massive danger to himself.

While there are occasions where people work for all their life, make a success and gain wealth through it, when this is passed down to their children through private education a different cycle begins. 

Money buys privilege, and more often than not, privilege leads to more money. Repeat. So you get a wealthy class which stays in this cycle but it is much harder for the normal person to reach, frequently near impossible. And this cycle, taking for instance it began with a person who 'made it' from scratch, is now enjoying this wealth for generations although they did not earn the initial capital.

The Bad Wolf could then have gone on to become a recurring big bad.  
  
Ten's own separate timeline would have played out as we saw it up to The End of Time, but the radiation booth is damaged and instead of Wilfred getting trapped, they both escape.  
  
Eight didn't get hit by a bus after escaping the Time War, Seven didn't get taken to the hospital to be accidentally killed by the surgeons, Six survived the Rani's attack, Five didn't spill half the bat's milk, Four didn't fall, Three defeated the Great One without entering the cave, Two got a pardon from the Time Lords, and One managed to get back to the TARDIS and rejuvenate before his energy was sapped.

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"The history of the British education system is interesting... here's your answer and a bit of background. 

Originally 'grammar' schools (although they weren't called that until the 13th c.) taught a narrow range of subjects, usually theology, Greek and Latin, and a bit of philosophy, music, astronomy, mathematics and law. Their purpose was to train the clergy so pupils learnt things a priest or monk should know; how to calculate when lent will be, how many hail Marys for coveting your neighbours petunias etc. 

When the first universities were founded in the UK in the 12th c. they recruited from these grammar schools, however in the 14th c. the first schools independent of the Church were founded. There's a lot of extra background to this centring around the advent of the renaissance in European thought and the first stirrings of opposition to Church power, particularly within philosophy where the rediscovery of ancient Greek and Latin texts were casting doubt on the authority of Aristotelian scholasticism (refer to r/philosophy and r/askhistorians if you want to know more about that.) 

For these newfangled schools, which included Eton and Winchester, because they weren't operating for the benefit of the church they couldn't get church funding so they relied on public endowments. Hence the name 'public school' was born. 

Most of the original grammar schools disappeared during the Protestant reformation but a few remain and are usually known as 'Cathedral schools' where they've kept their ties to the High Anglican or Catholic Churches. 

Modern 'Grammar' schools are unrelated institutions which were born of the Victorian Education act which made primary education compulsory for all children in the U.K

I agree with sending them to prison but then I don't agree with how the prison system handles its inmates.

For the fines I would think that at least offering a repayment option would be better instead of on the spot fines. This could also involve ""work"" of some description for the people who cannot afford it.

But this is mainly because I think that people who end up in prison should actually be offered some form of ""work"" based bonus scheme to get out early rather than just the case of good behaviour.

I didn't talk about any *great* alternatives.

We ([PBNI](http://www.pbni.org.uk)) have had community service orders (CSOs) since 1979, I am somewhat surprised you're asserting so much without a basic understanding of sentencing. England and Wales (NPB) have had community orders (COs) since 2003 and Ireland has CSOs too. There are a variety of sentencing options available to judges. In districts with sentencing guidelines, judges can still give sentences that are not in the guidelines (with good reason).

In the UK we have a huge problem with prison overcrowding. Irish prisons are in an even worse shape than ours. I agree with former UK Justice Minister, Jack Straw, who said prison should be reserved for the most dangerous criminals. Whether or not it's his place to tell judges what to do is neither here nor there, the fact is that he's right. Sending non-dangerous offenders to prison is a terrible idea, taking into account the effects on people's families, future employability, fraternizing with *hardened criminals*, prison overcrowding, cost of housing offenders who are not a danger to the public, and other reasons.

Now that it's clear that prison is a bad choice, we can look back at community service and other such requirements. You said that people should be offered some form of work and I agree. Why on earth should that be in a prison? Also, sentencing him to, for example, 240 hours of physically/intellectually demanding work is a loss of liberty as well.

I'll end it there, can you clearly explain why sending him to prison is a good idea?",0,1343934612,null,0,false,0,c5n7rkz,t3_xeibl,t1_c5n7rkz,t1_c5n6ph6,null,1429535895,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2

Do you think these people are just going to lay down and die? A lot of them will have no choice but to turn to crime in order to survive.

I've been on JSA for the past 8 months so I know exactly what it is like.  I got off my arse and volunteered for the whole time I was unemployed  and made sure I was doing something and now I am starting a new job in September. I know exactly what it is like. Not once in that time have I been offered one of the ""work for benefits"" placements so I know for a fact they aren't mandatory.

&gt;Do you think these people are just going to lay down and die? A lot of them will have no choice but to turn to crime in order to survive.

No. There is a choice for them to make, either do it or lose benefits. The choice is always there. I don't think they should be working in the private sector though and think the placements should be in the public or voluntary sector.

&gt;We need to make things as fair as we possibly can, otherwise the lower class will rise up, especially when you refuse to give them bread and circuses and try to enslave them instead.

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"Oh, in terms of actual analysis:

- We looked so much tidier when Lucas came on. He dropped deep and always made himself available for the pass, which Spearing had not done; in the first half, Gerrard had to keep dropping deep to collect the ball from defenders, but once Lucas was on Gerrard could focus purely on staying higher up the pitch in an attacking role. It's no coincidence his passing was a lot better when he was higher up the pitch and attempting fewer ridiculous Hollywood passes.

- Sterling was lively but lacks delivery in the final third (same for Enrique); he wasn't helped by players not attacking the box, a problem from last season as well.

- I can't wait to see Reina in this; no offense to Brad Jones, but there's no point using the keeper as a passing option if they'll hoof it up and concede possession

- In the first half, whenever Downing came up against a fullback, he tended to try and go outside and down the flank. Hopefully after that goal he'll cut inside more frequently.

- FC Gomel's pressing was far less impressively done in the second half; even though they roughed us up in the first half, it would have been exhausting. 

- There's obviously still a great deal of work to be done, and that first half was certainly poor, but Gomel are 13 games into their season, and half our team tonight is 1 week into pre-season. A 1-0 result away from home = job done. The pretty passing football should hopefully come with time.

- Good tracking back by Downing and Sterling, although at times we looked like a 4-5-1 when defending rather than a pressing 4-3-3. Not sure if that was by design (Rodgers being conservative for the away leg) or team unfamiliarity.

- Joe Cole...sigh.

Wing play was good, as I thought Cole was playing well before he came off, Downing scored the goal and was good in possession the whole match.  Sterling made some errors, but also was very creative and made a few chances just running at the defense.  

Borini's positional play was good, but the service to him just wasn't there, and when it was, he didn't do much with it.  I'm optomistic that as he plays with the midfield and wings more, that connection will become a lot more fluid.

Tennant would be more than up for it, unless of course he does what Tom Baker did with The Five Doctors, and say that it's far too soon for him to return to the show, which would be understandable.

McGann as well I think would be more than up for it, depending of course on the script and any there potential conditions that may pop up. (No doubt he would want the 8th Doctor's new outfit that he designed and not the one from the film, which he hated from the sound of things.)

McCoy's enthusiastic about everything, and stick his hat on him and he'll be fine, it's just a matter of whether Moffat wants him.

Colin and Tom Baker really don't look the part at all these days, but there's nothing stopping them from doing cameos as other characters or voiceovers.

And Peter Davison has already came back once, I see no reason why he wouldn't again.

I honestly believe that while Hurndell did do a good job in The Five Doctors, it was a little disrespectful to replace Hartnell and I feel the same way about replacing any of the first 3.

And from the sound of things, there will be multiple specials, so just because you hear something about one that doesn't sound like there will be any returning cast members in one episode, doesn't mean that there wont be in another.

I got off my arse and volunteered for the whole time I was unemployed and made sure I was doing something and now I am starting a new job in September. I know exactly what it is like. Not once in that time have I been offered one of the ""work for benefits"" placements so I know for a fact they aren't mandatory.

I know for a fact that the ***Mandatory Work Activity*** programme is in fact mandatory just like the name suggests because they tried to send my brother on one recently. He was recently kicked off ESA being found fit to work, regardless of the fact that he won't even leave his bedroom and can barely speak to people who he knows well, never mind strangers. So, he was forced to sign on to JSA and within a month, they tried to force him onto the MWA programme so he told them to go fuck themselves. Luckily, I'm not a scummy cunt and can afford to take care of him for those 13 weeks, but not everyone is so lucky.

In other words, stop talking shit.

&gt;No. There is a choice for them to make, either do it or lose benefits. The choice is always there. I don't think they should be working in the private sector though and think the placements should be in the public or voluntary sector.

So, they can choose slavery or starvation? Forcing someone into slavery, whether that be in private or the public sector is fucked up. Anyone who supports such policies is a scummy piece of shit and seriously need to have their heads kicked in.

If the government want to force people to work, then the only acceptable policy is to pay them minimum wage. Given that over 25s get £71 on JSA, that means it's only acceptable to force the unemployed to work for 11.68 hours per week, not fucking 30.

It's fucking bullshit policies like this which are leading to mentally unstable people (like my brother) setting themselves on fire in protest. If that was my brother, then I'd probably go on a killing spree and make sure everyone knew it was ultimately because of those polices.

&gt;Sounds like you've just watched The Dark Knight Rises or something, don't be so silly. The people have more than enough circuses.

Sounds like a rational response.

People can always do more to make themselves more employable than others.

No. Judges aren't publicly elected so they don't need to worry about that. Of course the public must have confidence in the CJS but dishing out prison sentences is not the right way to go about it.

I feel like Russel T. Davies was good at coming up with epic conflicts but bad at resolving them.

The problem was that, with the exception of Doomsday, the resolution of the conflicts always just ends up being some sort of ridiculous Deus Ex Machina.  

I didn't mind the Master and the flying spaceball things.  I actually kind of liked it.  I just thought it was stupid that the solution was to have the Doctor get his power back when everyone on Earth chants his name.  That feels like the resolution to a fairy tale.  It feels like something out of Peter Pan.  With the Doctor, I expect something that makes more sense.  I know they had that whole thing with the psychic network, but that wasn't enough to make it work for me.

The affects of his adventures on other people (especially his companions) has been explored throughout the series.  Some of season 4, especially Waters of Mars, explored the way his actions impacted history.  Seasons 5 and 6 have explored the way his reputation and celebrity status affect things.  In season 5, he was trying to use it to his advantage at times.  He saw it as something that could scare away his enemies.

But he also found out that his reputation could cause harm, leading his enemies to believe it was more important to destroy him than ever, and in the process cause more collateral damage to everyone else too.  We saw this when all his enemies teamed up in The Pandorica Opens, and we really saw this with the Silence.  The Doctor's become so famous that rather than hoping to avoid him in their schemes, his enemies are now actively seeking him out to destroy him by any means necessary, including using his companions and destroying the universe.

I think he partly realized this in A Good Man Goes to War and it really sunk in in The Wedding of River Song.  Whether he really succeeds in going back to being an adventurer, rather than a celebrity, remains to be seen.

For me personally, the books and the audios are barely above the level of fan fiction so far as the continuity of Doctor Who is concerned.  That's not an insult: there's been fanfic I absolutely loved, and I know some authors who got paid for writing DW novels.  But to me, none of them count as ""really happened"" but are just what-if theorizing.

The television show is under no obligation to honor anything shown in a book or an audio, and if the show says something that contradicts one of these other sources, what the show says on air is what stands.

True, but in this case Quinn's money (at least 455 million Euro anyway) was obtained from the taxpayer. Gombeenery, especially after the costly and lengthy Moriarty Tribunal is going to have to be cracked down on, and I'm sure the prosecution will press for that all important headline.


&gt;(Generally speaking) none of them should be imprisoned. Two wrongs don't make a right.

True

&gt;This is essentially the root of the problem. The majority of the public see community service orders as a soft option. You only need to look at the US to see the terrible effects of penal populism. 

Absolutely. But Quinn is the reason every insurance policy sold down south until 2017 will have a 2% charge levied on it due to the black hole left in Quinn Insurance. They see him, and the board of Anglo Irish, FF cronies etc. as having caused this, as well as the huge cuts in government spending, increased taxes etc.

Roger Ebert added, ""What was so wrong about black and white movies in the first place? By filming in black and white, movies can sometimes be more dreamlike and elegant and stylized and mysterious. They can add a whole additional dimension to reality, while color sometimes just supplies additional unnecessary information.""

Americans have their own versions of baked beans in some states but the sauce is different and so it's a completely different taste. Heinz makes alternative recipe baked beans for the American market so you really should look for the shop shelves with union jacks on them to be sure. For the bacon you want British or Danish smoked back bacon. For the sausages you want proper British bangers (the type that combine the succulence of pig meat with the piquancy of sawdust). Note frankfurters aren't real sausages, they are just sausage shaped lies. If you're going to try frying bread make sure the oil is hot, you're after crispy deliciousness, not soggy oiliness. The eggs you may do to your own tastes but I recommend you poach them (crack them gently in to gently simmering water and allow to cook for 3-4 minutes, white should be firm but yellow should be a bit runny). You absolutely must include fried tomato and fried or boiled mushrooms. A fried tomato looks like a blood clot, but tastes divine.

In the first-past-the-post system that we have in the UK, minor parties without particular geographic concentrations don't have much of a chance. 13-15% of the vote spread evenly across the country would result in no seats in parliament, but in EU proportional elections would net quite a few. It's not so much that the supporters don't turn out, it's that it doesn't matter if they do or not - they're not concentrated enough in any one constituency to make a difference. The lib-dems and Scottish and Welsh nationalists get seats because they have constituencies where their support is concentrated.

That being said, if Boris were the tory leader at the next general election, there might be one of two outcomes: a) the coalition will be blamed for the current economic problems, and everyone will vote against them, resulting in a labour landslide - which would happen even if Churchill had came back from the dead and had Shakespeare as his speech-writer, or b) Boris will be able to present a sufficiently genuine, sincere, pragmatic face that the tories will feel like a different party and they might have a cat-in-hell's chance.",0,1343949581,null,0,false,0,c5nbyl5,t3_xk6fn,t1_c5nbyl5,t1_c5n41z8,null,1429537867,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The unemployed and most vulnerable in society have nothing more *to* give. It's the rich and powerful who need to give or face the inevitable consequences. It's you who has a warped view of society, expecting the poor to support and prop up the rich.

&gt;You're a joke mate. Keep fantasising about the Revolution whilst you piss away your remaining years fixing computers on a Liverpool council estate and grow old knowing that you will have had no meaningful impact on anything.

I enjoy fixing computers and educating my neighbourhood about bittorrent so that they can download whatever they want free of charge. As for having no impact on anything, I made my impact years ago. Quite a few games I made where best sellers and undoubtedly inspired a new generation of developers. I left that industry because the corporations came in and fucked it up big time. That's the main reason I stopped being a capitalist whore. Thankfully, the indie scene is back and stronger than ever.

On the one hand you have people who rioted on that first night out of desperation at their situation, people who felt marginalised by the government due to increasing cuts and who felt unfairly targeted by police. These people attacked police property and the property of those seen to be helping the police. Then, on the other hand, you have the large majority of people who rioted and looted on the other nights, some out of desperation, but many more out of greed, boredom and a whole host of other completely unrelated reasons. These people just robbed and burned whatever they could, because they could. This had nothing to do with Duggan's death directly, it was just an excuse to them if anything at all.

It is impossible to solve such a myriad of problems in one year. However, it took the spark of the initial anti-police protests and violence of a few to spur thousands of other, completely unconnected and opportunistic people into a crime spree. Without such a catalysing event I doubt we'll see riots this summer.

I've massively oversimplified the events here because I should be in bed, but the ideas are taken from [this book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Englishmen-Myths-realities-riots-ebook/dp/B006654U9U/constabler-21) which is pretty much the only academic account so far of the riots.

true,ColonelFlashman,wales-carmrthenshire,West is Best,"&gt;The unemployed and most vulnerable in society have nothing more to give.

Don't talk absolute nonsense. I live in one of Wales' most deprived towns and I know full well about the teenage mothers that have babies because they get stuff paid for, I know about the lads that are too bone idle to attend job centre interviews. I don't expect the poor to prop up the rich at all; the poor get free education, healthcare, roads, homes, emergency services from society. I expect them to contribute to society; not to the rich. Some people refuse to help their own communities.

&gt;That's the main reason I stopped being a capitalist whore. Thankfully, the indie scene is back and stronger than ever.
Stop pretending that you know me, you haven't got a fucking clue what you're talking about.

You are a cliche mate. Communist keyboard warrior by numbers.

&gt;I left that industry because the corporations cam in and fucked it up big time. That's the main reason I stopped being a capitalist whore. 

I don't think there will be anyone that reads this comment, yourself included that believes that is the real reason.

&gt;Yes, because it's just that easy. 

It is that easy to become a town councillor, then a county councillor, then an MP. The first two especially. I don't think teaching people how to use bittorent so they can download stuff is really the best way you could be serving your community. 


&gt;The unemployed will right this problem themselves in time and it will involve the bloodshed of people like you. You're simply too stupid to realise that that's their only option.

Fantasist mate. The situation in the UK is a long way from descending into revolution. You are the type of nutter that longs for a zombie apocalypse. Keep telling you self that eventually some catalyst will happen and your life won't be so shit.

De Jong I do like but I think he's a bit lazy, a couple of times last season we've conceded goals from set plays where his marking and lack aerial presence has let us down (something that wouldn't happen with Martinez in that position) and Dzeko, I don't know, sometimes he's brilliant, sometimes he's awful, its too much of a gamble. 

People say they don't want RVP because he's getting on and injury problems in the past, I want him because when he plays he is consistently good. He scores alot of goals and he is a creative force in all the games he plays he chases the game and plays good football.

I would want to sign up some youngster deputy full back and give Clichy the first choice shirt, get Martinez in and get RVP in. Kolo can go as well if they wanna give decent money for him, we can bring in a squad player for a small fee and not pay them silly wages too.

true,destria,eng-buckinhamshire,Buckinghamshire,"I too went to a grammar school from year 7 to sixth form. I also live near a town rather infamous for its low socio-economic standing where I went to primary school, whereas my secondary school was in a nearby affluent area. I look at how my school mates from primary school are doing, the ones who went to local comprehensives compared to grammar schools, and the difference is shocking (teen pregnancies, asbos, prison...unheard of in my 'posh' grammar school). I'm eternally grateful for having the opportunity to go to a grammar school and think it's probably the single most important factor in how well I did at school; not to say I would have done badly at a comprehensive, but I'm almost certain I would have done *worse.*


So I do support the idea of grammar schools. It really does allow for huge social mobility. For context, I was raised by a single immigrant mother working part-time and I'm the first in my family to go to a university (a good one at that).


But I can't say the majority of my classmates were like that. Most of them already came from affluent middle-class families. I always felt distinctly more poor than the rest of my classmates. I was one of 2 people in my year to receive EMA and the school admin had no idea how to deal with it as it clearly only rarely came up. A lot of them had tutoring for the 11+ and more afterwards. The 11+ in its current form does not eliminate the fact that if you throw money at a kid, they can be trained to pass the 11+ with minimal intelligence. And like you said, they tend to be in expensive areas and limits in the catchment mean that they're almost exclusively pooling from kids who have parents which can afford to live in these expensive areas. 


So I support the idea in principle but in practice, they should do more to look into how to make the 11+ more accessible and less dependent on tutoring.

The colorizing of released episodes though shows immediate benefits and doesn't suffer from the same problems as the animations. It helps modernize the old videos and actually moves the mental process *away* from the inconsistencies in the scene and lets me focus more on the actual story.

There seems to be some sort of a power struggle going on for control of the Chelsea Pitch Owners right now..  or at least that's what it looks like to me.  There was apparently controversy very recently when a bunch of shares changed hands..  which might or might not shift the balance of power enough for a move away from Stamford Bridge to legally be able to proceed.

They had a vote recently about how much voting power each share should have ..  and I think they are selling shares again, so shares are changing hands again..  

Obviously there are at least two factions, one of which wants the option to move away from SB to be on the table if there's an opportunity to move..  I just hope Abramovich doesn't stick his nose into this too much - it seems like there is a lot of politics going on behind the scenes ..  and all of this has to be resolved, but being sneaky and/or stronghanded about it?  That could backfire.

true,dalekai,dalek,Dalek,"This post will obviously contain spoilers from Torchwood and Doctor Who.

1. Both Amy and Gwen are introduced wearing police uniforms.
2. Both Amy and Gwen are the only members of their team/group that are of a different nationality and a common plot point is pointing out cultural stereotypes each woman exhibits.
3. Both Amy and Gwen are romantically attracted to the immortal main character (at least at one time or another) who consistently pushes each woman toward her boyfriend. This is an ongoing plot point.
4. Gwen's boyfriend is Rhys Williams. Amy's is Rory Williams. Mr. Pond jokes are a Steven Moffat original.
5. Both women get pregnant under circumstances involving aliens. The pregnancy is resolved in one or two episodes, but it pits the immortal main character against the boyfriend for at least a few scenes before everyone makes up. The pregnancy is fast-tracked.
6. The jealousy experienced by each Mr. R. Williams toward the immortal main character is a commonly addressed plot point.
7. The wedding of each woman and her Mr. Williams is an important plot point in the show.
8. Each woman gives birth to a child. Which, again affects the plot in some large way.
9. Both Amy and Gwen desire a life doing alien stuff whereas their significant others want a simple life. The fact that each woman refuses to settle down is a reoccurring plot point. Both Mr. Williams are forced to compromise. 
10. Both Mr. Williams are portrayed as socially inferior to their girlfriend and the fact that each man is ""lucky to have her"" is commonly addressed.
11. Both Mr. Williams are portrayed as bumbling fools that require their smarter, compassionate girlfriends to look after them. ""I have to take care of him"" is a sentiment expressed by both women at some point. Rory eventually grows out of this, but maintains his puppy-dog attachment to his girlfriend.
11. Both couples' financial situation is vastly improved by coming into contact with the immortal main character (the Doctor gives Amy and Rory a house and car, Jack gives Gwen a job with a really fantastic sign-on bonus) Both immortals push financial gains toward the characters ""so that they can have a normal life.""

Those were the ones I was able to come up with without skimming episodes.

Even drawing from the new show alone, it could get awfully crowded - I thought the season 4 finale wasn't able to give many of the characters enough time because it had so many - let alone if they start dipping into original series doctors or companions.

Season 4 wraps up a lot of loose ends and season 5 sort of starts a new story arc, so season 5's opener doesn't really require any knowledge of the previous seasons or characters to enjoy while also being generally considered more representative of the best the show has to offer, which is why it's popular to use for convincing friends to get into the show.

If you're enjoying yourself in season 1, though, then by all means just keep going in season 1.  It's still lots of fun and has some important moments continuity-wise (especially for the character development of Rose and the Doctor), and you can just look forward to things getting even better in future seasons.

One thing that changed over the years was the original idea of the Doctor as a wise old man surrounded by younger, fitter companions who took care of the more strenuous action.

The way I see it is 'Doctor Who' is a bit of a formal title, and 'The Doctor' is just what he prefers to be called. Like calling someone Bobby instead of Robert.

There was also a bit of a running joke in the classic series in which he would introduce himself, people would say,""Doctor Who?"" and he would come back with,""Exactly.""

There's even a bit of a callback in Let's Kill Hitler, where The Doctor says,""You say she's killed The Doctor. Doctor Who?"" and then gives a very knowing smirk. So, at the very least, there seems to be some 'inside joke' The Doctor has to the name Doctor Who.

At the end of the day, though, it's easy to identify towards non-fans. For instance, whenever I see the cast of Lost referenced in popular media, it's always,""The Lost survivors,"" when technically they're the Flight 815 survivors. I don't let it bother me, though, because I know people who haven't watched the series have no idea what Flight 815 is.

And on a final note, everyone calls him that. I've seen Tom Baker sign letters as 'Doctor Who', I've seen interviews with both RTD and Moffat in which they call him Doctor Who, and obviously even the creators called him as such since he was originally credited as Doctor Who. In fact the only reason why he has been credited as The Doctor for the last few seasons is because Tennant asked to be credited as The Doctor.",0,1343976068,null,0,false,0,c5ni2fi,t3_xlwvh,t1_c5ni2fi,t1_c5nhzb3,null,1429540815,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

But, of course, we've got no evidence that they actually plan to do it besides rumors that Tom Baker's coming back.

I guess it's possible that Eccleston would be willing to come back, it might depend on how he was approached.  I don't think the 50th anniversary would be what he'd be looking for to develop his Doctor more, though, considering there's only so much time he'd be able to get in that.  I get the impression that he liked being the Doctor but mainly left because he hated the way the higher-ups ran things and felt like they told him how to play the Doctor too much and didn't give him enough control over his own character.  So it makes sense that he would have wanted to get the chance to develop his character more.

So it makes sense he would have liked to have gotten more time to play the Doctor and developing them despite having left on bad terms.

But it doesn't seem to me like making an appearance in the 50th anniversary would really give him the chance to do that, since if they bring him back they're likely to bring back lots of other characters (Tom Baker's already rumored).  I mean, the quotes in this article can be read as him wanting to get back to the Doctor, but they can just as easily be read as him feeling like the problems he had that made him leave stopped him from doing as much with the character as he wanted, with no indication he actually plans to revisit it now that he's left.

It has reached a point where the interests of the average match-going Chelsea fan are no longer in sync with some of what the CPO is doing, the last remaining thing it did (post Roman takeover) that was of any use. Without CPO backing, how can people expect to put down close to £1 Billion for a new stadium without knowing if he even has access to the freehold of Stamford Bridge to finance it first.

This leads people to underestimate him, and not realise that he is an utterly ruthless businessman who will stop at nothing to win.

true,Guardianista,cnty-uk,London/Exeter,"&gt;&gt;How do Grammar schools prevent anyone from getting a good education? Does anyone lose out from some of the more academic students getting into another school[?].

[Yes.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9148701/Grammar-school-entry-threshold-inflated-by-coaching.html) Those who get into grammar schools via hot-housing and tutoring (expensive and a barrier to those with modest means) are not always well equipped to deal with the academic rigours of a grammar school. Those who are too poor to afford hot-housing and tutoring may miss out by a small margin and yet be more worthwhile candidates. 

Secondly by taking the smartest children/richest children out of local schools you are damaging the local community and encouraging segregation. Already you have created a ""haves and have not's"" that will continue through university and beyond.

As for your second point: I would still assume that the vast majority of a grammar schools intake is via the 11 plus. Personally I don't feel this is a good age to separate children and doing so via a standardised test is pure stupidity. Why take 6 years of recorded academic performance at primary school and throw it away in favour of test that like of which many children from poorer backgrounds will have never seen?

Grammar schools are a flawed overhang from the 1950's. It's time they were done away with and replaced with a educational system fit for all. ",0,1343988917,null,0,false,0,c5njpww,t3_xlatc,t1_c5njpww,t1_c5njjx1,null,1429541592,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

As for the issue of money and tutoring, that is a problem, but sadly those with money will always be able to do better for their children then those without. Even without Grammars, abuse of catchment zones and similar tactics will always allow richer families to get their children into better schools. 

At least Grammars give opportunities to children regardless of money. The alternative, which we're already starting to see, is a two tiered education system of those who can afford public schools and those who can't. Getting rid of Grammar schools just makes it so the only road to success in this country is going direct from a public school to Oxbridge.

 The club had the highest average attendance in English football in 1907–08, 1909–10,1911–12, 1912–13 and 1913–14. A crowd of 67,000 attended a league game against Manchester United on Good Friday 1906, a then-record for a football match in London. 55,000 attended the first-ever London derby in the top division, against Woolwich Arsenal (before the mercenary uprooting of the team by the crooks Norris and Hill), a record for a First Division match. 77,952 attended a fourth round FA Cup tie against Swindon on 13 April 1911.

The visit of Arsenal on 12 October 1935 attracted a crowd 82,905 to Stamford Bridge, which remains a club record and the second highest ever attendance at an English league match. Our highest ever attendance is thought to be the region of 100,000 for the match against Moscow Dynamo in November 1945 - the ground was so full that accurate counting was impossible - it was officially counted as a riot due to the amount of people over running the gates and climbing/entering any nearby building to view the match.

Following the League win in 1955, Chelsea should have been the first English team to enter the inaugural European Champions Cup - precursor to today's Champions league. We were kept out by the FA and Football League, who did not want English football to be distracted by European competition...what might have been....if it hadn't have been for Heysel/Liverpool, we would have been in Europe in 1985 also....

We were *the* club of the sixties....everyone who was anyone came to and followed Chelsea - [like this](http://www.legendesportart.com/products/categories/legende-sports-art/sporting-photography/raquel-welch-in-chelsea-football-club-kit), and we followed the sixties by beating 6 times European Champions Real Madrid (the flair side of the day) in 1971.

Many Liverpool fans think that they competed in some sort of golden era, with local boys turning up at Anfield for the love of the game. They forget/don't know that Liverpool was owned by one of the richest families of the day - the Moores family, who had a staggering fortune (of the time) with which to support/fund the club. Rich owners making football their past time is not a new thing.

We may not be able to point to quite as many trophies in the past, but we can look forward to many in the future.

We don't have to constantly look back at our history, we are living it and making it.

We are Blue.

We are Chelsea.

true,Guardianista,cnty-uk,London/Exeter," “If you wanna fix schools, that's easy, all you have to do is make private schools illegal” -Warren Buffett

Grammar schools are there so that talented working class/middle class children can compete with private schools. It's a noble idea, but one that is flawed in its execution. We don't have a meritocracy and we never will while there are private schools, private tutors, bad parents, expensive childcare etc. We have to deal with those problems first before we start talking about aiding our best students. Put simply: we don't know who our best students are because we are wasting huge amounts of potential in this country. Childcare should be available for free from year 1, we should all have same quality of education throughout the school system. 

 Streaming in schools is a whole other issue and there are many studies questioning it's usefulness. I remember a study where they put the students from the bottom set into the top one. The students from the bottom set not only managed to survive at that higher level but actually increased their own grades. If we class some children as better than others than we get a self-fulfilling prophecy.

I understand why people want grammar schools, they have been sold the idea of choice. But education isn't a choice, its a right. Having ""better schools"" is as abhorrent to me as having ""better hospitals"" or ""better police services"". I would much rather we levelled the playing field than contributed to the skewed system. 

So how do we best manage talented children? By better teaching. If we had smaller class sizes and more teacher-pupil time then we would be able to respond to the needs of students and bring out their full potential. That's a much better system than throwing away the majority of students at age 11.",0,1343995458,null,0,false,0,c5nk6zc,t3_xlatc,t1_c5nk6zc,t1_c5njuhp,null,1435695968,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

If we can get Rondon for the 10 mil said in this piece, or even if we have to go up to, say, $12 mil, which I think Levy will do, seeing as how we don't a single striker right now, I think that would be a great addition.

The thing is, I don't know where this leaves Defoe. He already voiced his displeasure last season at being the #2 striker and not seeing many starts. In my opinion, we would be signing Rondon to be our #2 striker, behind a bigger acquisition. That would leave Defoe as our #3, which he would definitely not be happy about. While I love Defoe coming off the bench in the 2nd half, especially last year, because Adebayor tended to ""check out"" in the 2nd half, I don't think he would settle for that.

There are plenty of options you could choose to believe beside a 'ghost' certainly beside a supernatural event, physics doesn't forbid time travel certainly not of simple things like light and neither does it forbid echo effects or any such like ways of transposing data from one point of time into another - just because you believe in science doesn't mean you can't believe in traditionally supernatural events such as anachronistic items and time-distorted visions; amazingly when you look into it not only does the physics refuse to disprove them (even Einstein talks about this, we don't need to trust Mitchio Kaku and etc.) but the history of recorded events is actually fairly compelling.  
  
In cultures all over the world people have described odd events which seem to defy explanation, even in the modern scientific era these are common - it could be that the same fantasies appeal universally; however it could also be that some unknown system is at work causing odd effects.  
  
maybe occasionally a crease in space-time causes all the photons that hit a certain area to be transported forward a certain amount of time with the same speed and vector - thus anyone in the right place will witness the scene in much the same way a television works.

true,AnthonyCharlesXavier,null,null,"&gt;It is thought that Patagonian Indians may have reached the islands by canoe, but when the Europeans encountered the islands in the seventeenth century, they were uninhabited. The British landed in 1690 and claimed the islands. The first settlement was by the French, at Port Louis on East Falkland in 1764. Spain soon after pressured the French to leave, and in 1767, forced the British out of a settlement on West Falkland. Argentina claimed the islands in the late 1820s, and the British reclaimed them in 1833. In the late 1800s, sheep ranching brought some wealth, and the British declared the islands a colony in 1892. Although the Argentinian were forced out in 1833, they did not abandon their claim. In the late 1960s, Britain began to make moves to hand over the colony to Argentina. However, the process was slow, and in 1982, Argentina's government staged an invasion. Britain sent troops to retake the islands. The ensuing war took nearly one thousand lives (three-quarters of them Argentinian), and after seventy-two days, Argentina surrendered and its president resigned. Argentina's government holds to the conviction that it will retake the Falklands, although it declines to use military force to back up its claim.


This is why I hate how the Argentines claim the Falklands. They claimed it for a total of 13 years. They weren't there first. The people there are not Argentinian.

true,Ch13fWiggum,eng-Herefordshire,Herefordshire,"Having experienced both sides of educational divide, I have to say it's not unexpected.

At state school we had 2 1hr sessions of PE a week (which included time to get changed, so you're looking at 2 40minutes sessions of actual execise a week), anything else was optional.

At private school, we had half days on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays so that we could spend the afternoon playing sports. Yep that's 3 afternoons of sport a week. You then also had an optional activity afternoon on mondays (the option was what activity you did, rather than if you did one) this is where minor sports (like badminton and tennis) were done. We also had a CCF corp on Wednesday, so that meant that target shooting was an available minor sport.

Now obviously some of this is down to more facilities and equipment (for those sports that need it), but the main reason behind this is the fact that kids at private school put in the time and effort to become good at their sport and their teachers put in the effort to help them become good. If state schools were prepared to put the time in, it may be a different kettle of fish.

Might as well argue that we're lagging behind Norway and Switzerland in our skiing and bobsleigh achievements, or point out that there's not many teams from Africa in the sailing/rowing competitions.

I don't care so much about him being 22 because getting young players doesn't matter anymore past a certain point.

However, he'd be our second-best CM defensively (excluding Gerrard because none of us want to see him used defensively), obviously suits the system and is a talented/capable passer, and our lack of cover for Lucas is a big concern - I don't know if you saw the Gomel game, but it again highlighted the huge amount of work Spearing needs to do if he's to play the DM role to an acceptable standard, and also how heavily we rely on Lucas for midfield coherence. Having another CM who can do Lucas' job, but also coexist with him, would make a big difference.

Assuming the sighting was truthful, which we will because the article implies multiple confirmation, what they saw was another car that obviously wasn't so badly damaged as to get the hell out of dodge. Probably a drunk driver. Might have smashed his lights which would explain why nobody saw it leave. 

Coincidence and nothing more. 

For a sense of intrigue I like the guilty concious explanation as well. But that definitely would have been followed up on. Unless it was anonymous. It would depend on whose skeleton it was. Obviously someone who wasn't missed which implies no passengers or family or a passenger who kept his mouth shut. And believe it or not alarm bells would go off if someone with the wherewithall to own a car and put petrol in it went missing that length of time. Outside chance of an OAP perhaps. Would explain the crash and why they weren't missed. 

Its tempting to go along with someone reporting the crash months after simply because the report was near christmas and that fucks with even the most hardened villians brain but the article says nothing about the possibility the skeleton found wasn't the driver. Of course if there were 2 people in the car and the driver legged it and then got a guilty conscience and the skeleton was a family member that would explain why the skeleton wasn't reported missing. 

Two accidents obviously makes more sense than ghosts. And the fact that there tends to be accident hotspots adds weight to that. Its actually pretty common to get multiple unrelated accidents at the same place for the same reasons.

It's important to remember that almost all sports tuition is private (and therefore costs money). 

Private school is just one of the privileges enjoyed by the children of wealthy people, but a lot of these articles seem to suggest that the Olympians are successful *just because* they went to private school. The school isn't the deciding factor.

Put over-simplistically, there's probably a correlation between an Olympian's success and the value of their childhood home, the newness of their first car, or what brand of wellies they own. Rich people have a better chance of being good at sport, and rich people also go to private schools.

It would be disingenuous to say that there was no link at all, though. The facilities are better, the staff are better, and there's that intangible ethos which just isn't present in most state schools. However I think one of the main factors on that front is the competitive spirit. Private schools are extremely keen to pit their pupils against each other, with inter-school rivalries lasting decades or even centuries. State schools don't seem to have the same hankering for competition. **State schools are so scared of creating losers that they don't create winners** or something.

And that's before you even get started about 'elf and safety: If an ambulance gets called to a private school rugby match, that's par for the course. If an ambulance gets called to a state school softball integration exercise (or whatever), it'll be in the local papers.

anyway tl;dr I agree with Mr Wiggum but I think the issue is far more complicated than the papers are making out.",0,1344004103,null,0,false,0,c5nlq33,t3_xm7u4,t1_c5nlq33,t1_c5nl9ji,null,1429542539,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Hazard/Marin--Mata/Oscar/Marin--Ramires/Marin?/Hazard?/?  
....................Mikel---Lampard

I personally don't think Mata should play on the LW, as whenever he did under AVB he always tended to drift centrally anyway which ended up causing problems.  He also doesn't have the speed to create width on the wing like Hazard.

Speaking of Hazard I think he should stay on the LW due to his aforementioned speed and tendency to try to take players on.  I think that's wasted a bit in the middle.

Also, from the impression I've gotten from watching Brazil in the olympics, I don't think Oscar should play in the holding midfield role, he's seemed like an out-and-out #10.  He'd be a waste there, and if he did drift towards the box we would be suspect defensively.

That's not to say that when(ever) they add new words to the main body Whovian might not appear. ""Trekkie"", as in a fan of Star Trek, is already in the central version. However, the word has to have documented evidence of being in use for some time, and as far as I know (though I could be wrong), ""Whovian"" is pretty new.

1. Nostalgia. I remember coming here all my life, I can't bear going anywhere else, no matter the cost to the club

2. Campaign55 maintains 55,000 people can fit at Stamford Bridge. They have vague bullshit from the council (pandering to stop us from leaving the area, but entirely unrealistic) and say the club is lying about expansion capabilities so they can buy the freehold off CPO. Some think the club has no intention of moving and only wants to buy the freehold back, and that they will increase to 55000 as soon as they have the freehold. They want to keep the freehold and have the expansion... Morons

3. Profiteering. Some think they should be entitled to many times more than they paid for the original CPO share (£100). I have no problem with paying them the inflated cost based on when they purchased but it was never intended to be a profitable enterprise for the purchasers. I believe CPO still has around £9m in loans outstanding to the club which is kind of a security to keep the freehold with CPO and not being sold on, though many other measures exist

4. Location, location, location. Earl's Court is unrealistic, Battersea is all but gone. The Imperial Wharf site is cool but too small. Only other option nearby is Old Oak Common, which is in Harlesden and thus, a shithole. They don't see where the club could move that would be acceptable

5. Roman. Some people still don't trust him. They think by selling him the freehold, he'll move the club outside of London to somewhere cheap, sell SB, recoup some of his investment then shift the club on to some other rich dude. This is almost too idiotic to take seriously, but it exists

I was quite pleased to have been one of the 200 votes that tipped the Lib Dem candidate to victory here, as my main goal in voting was not to have the Conservatives in power. (You can argue that is a bad way to vote, but with the system we have in this country, a vote for Labour would literally have been a waste)

Obviously that plan has backfired somewhat spectacularly, although initially I was prepared to see if the Coalition could work.

Now though I can't really see the point in voting at all.

Labour (who I would generally supprt) will not win a seat here.

Conservatives I do not support.

Lib Dems I don't want to give any form of endorsement to them after the shambles they have been a part of, although my objective opinion is this would still be the best to vote for, as they are unlikely to end up repeating the Coalition a second time round, and they weren't a bad party in opposition.

imagine a section of space between you and the outside being filled with glass just like a window; the light passes through the window and comes out the other side unaffected, despite having passed through an entirely different medium and having been slowed down considerable and bent all over the place as it entered and exited (refraction) - now imagine the glass is a section of 'hot space' or 'negative space' which has January on one side of it and December on the other; the light is passing through in the same way it would a window, however it is exiting not into another room but into another time.

But the inescapable reality is that some rapists will actively seek out people who are unable to resist.  In addition, some people might have sex with you believing that you are consenting when you are actually too drunk to give meaningful consent at all.  
  
These things can be made less likely to happen if you drink less, so making people aware of the possible risks of getting too drunk is therefore a sensible thing to do.  That much is not victim blaming - it's just sensible advice.  
  
I think that's all the police were genuinely trying to do here, but I do think that the ad completely missed the mark.  If you're going to give that sort of advice, you need to make it *very* clear that only rapists are to blame for rape.  You need to ensure that people know that you're not saying 'if you drink too much it's your own fault if you get raped'.

Granted, the statues are still out get anyone in their way, but the Angels found within the Maze of the Dead are an army of predators, unlike the quartet discovered at Wester Drumlins.

However it's also very true that we don't understand all of physics yet, i know to most people with a high-school education and an interest in science which goes as far as signing upto 'i fucking love science' on facebook have the idea that physics is over and we're a small step away from working out the unified field theory and closing the book - that's because they're not paying attention to the amazing implications of modern understanding. 
  
watch this, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCQ_3qE6SmQ it's shouldn't be too complex really if you don't worry too much about the math - it's not pseudoscience in the slightest but it should introduce you to a few on the important concepts - recently there was a big stink about scientists (chinese i think) proving time travel impossible, obviously they didn't they just solved a very focused question about the nature of photons [all within the confines of SOL's gravity well] - CERN's proof of the higs is another big step to understanding some aspects of the universe and in proving variations of the quantum model however we're a long way from really dealing with the big questions of dimensionality; it is however worth noting that all the major theories which predict the higgs are backed by maths which only functions in a model containing more dimensions than the 'real' world which we're used to dealing with.  
  
So no, i'm not saying this was certainly a freak occurrence of physics - how could i expect to know that without a serious study of the situation?  however, i am saying it's possible and i am saying that it's a common enough story to have 'seen back in time' that we shouldn't view this as a 'one single random occasion' simply as something which might happen from time to time and rarely be noticed by someone and recorded; in fact it might be much more common than we would imagine - maybe it's happening almost constantly but people almost never see it, and those who do never believe their senses.

I'm guessing all it means is it likely hasnt been updated online yet. These things get press released and the press have probably published it before the OED has updated it or they might have made the decision to add the word and now the lexicographers are doing their work (which is stupidly thorough) which may take some time before they add it.

Over two-thirds of cases dropped out at the police stage and did not make it as far as the courts.

One quarter of incidents initially recorded as rape were subsequently 'no-crimed' by the police.
Cases where the complainant and suspect were acquaintances were most likely to be 'no-crimed'.
Half of all the cases that were 'crimed' resulted in 'no further action' (NFA) by the police.

Cases involving intimates were most likely to be NFA-ed or discontinued by the CPS.

In the small minority of 'stranger rape' cases (only 12% of the full sample), where a suspect was identified the case was more likely to proceed to court than in those cases where the complainant and suspect were previously acquainted.

The Police should be focusing on these issues, not telling women who are bombarded with information basically consisting of 

""do not leave the house and have a life if you do not want to get raped""

true,TheLushCompanion,mcgann,McGann,"I really wish this stupid half theory would just die already. Thanks to this posting though, I have figured out what bugs me about this and several other similar theories I've seen posted on here. In the last few months on Reddit I've seen ""What if Rory is really the Master?"", ""What if Donna becomes the Doctor's TARDIS?"", ""What if Jenny is Susan's mom?"" and ""What if River is Susan's grandmother?"" too many times to count. I hate all these theories, and the reason why is because all four of them involve a retconning of established events and relationships that are already richly developed in the history of this show. The appeal seems to be ""ZOMG! IT BLOWS MY MIND!"" In reality, I think that most of the appeal is to those who are only familiar with the revival series. I know there are some exceptions, but I do think most of the appeal is within that demographic. In addition, the only explanation for any of them is ""Wibbly wobbly, timey wimey, derpy derp!"" I think very interesting stories can be told without trying to go back and remake the Doctor's history. Frankly, if we're going to find out about Susan's ancestry, it needs to be waaaay cooler than some Johnny-come-lately character that was just introduced in the last couple of seasons. I trust that Steven Moffat has more respect for the show than to do something so. . . cheap. Frankly, if any of these superficial twists came to be a part of the established show I would find them just as cringe-worthy as John Byrne's run on Wonder Woman in the late 90s. His arrogance demanded a complete retelling of her origin story, only it was WORSE than the original. It was trite, stupid, and he couldn't even be arsed to draw a decent costume. Edit a word.

true,pearface,null,null,"My county doesn't have grammar schools. I went to an average results ex-comp high school in a lower middle class suburb. I transferred to a very good sixth form which was 45 mins by bus away where I got 3As at A2, then went on to a top uni to study science. 

In high school the good teachers did really well explaining the subject very thoroughly. At other times behaviour was so bad I would sit on the sidelines of noise and choas, continuing to work. At the better sixth form behaviour was really good and the school ethos was great. 

However at the top university I strugged to learn. The lecturers didn't use the basic teaching skills or learning materials that the state school system makes uniform. However there were lots of private school and grammar school students who were fine with it all. 

The state sector needs to embrace the intellectual ethos of the elite universities, and that is what I think was critical to the success of the original grammar system. Selection is used in the majority of state high schools, for maths, english and science (in all years) and works well in these subjects. However I think the social problems caused by selecting through entire schools aren't justified. 

I think we need to move away from the very prescriptive, knowledge based national cirriculum. We need to focus on critical thinking and practical skills. Doing these in the same school means students have the oportunity to experience both, even if they focus on an academic route. 

Also I would produce some propaganda (:p) to truly ensure every state school student is getting stonger aspirational and intellectual messages. Insipirational dvds for high school assemblies that will expand student horizons, showing strong figures from science, humanities, arts, buisness and industry talking about their experiences. Educational ones for primary and secondary schools that focus on the key skills and can be used a few times a term.

Reports of rape and sexual assault are often not taken nearly seriously enough.  
  
When you factor in the mental health issues that often stem from being a victim of rape and sexual assault, and the fact that many such attacks are not reported at all (possibly for fear of being judged, treated like a liar, and so on) then it becomes clear that if you're going to give advice to people about minimising their risk factors, then you'd better make damn sure that they understand that you're not blaming them for being attacked.  
  
With rape and sexual assault, you simply must be a little bit more gentle with the way you get that message across, because you're dealing with a completely different situation than you are when dealing with burglary and car theft.

true,rbnc,cnty-wales,Wales. Living in Germany.,"In the 20th-21st century, each religion does however seem to have its 'things'; themes that reoccur too much to be mere coincidence.

Catholicism has paedophilia, Judaism has its sexism, Scientology has its money and closet homosexuality and Islam seems to deal in suicide bombings, stonings and filicide.

I'm not of course suggesting that all Catholics are paedophiles (or the reverse). I'm not implying that all Muslims are in support of suicide bombing, but if one was to search 'murder' in Google News Search. And searched through the most recent news articles, you'd be hard pressed to find a common denominator, Murders tend to be committed by people of all religions, races. ages etc*. If one was to search 'suicide bombing' in  Google News Search, you will find stories of bombing carried out by people of many different races, men and women, young and old, backgrounds of varying wealth, people of intelligence ranging from university educated to the mentally disabled.  But the vast majority of suicide bombers will be carried out by members of one certain religion; Islam. I would estimate of the first 100 articles, perhaps 1 will feature a non-Muslim suicide bomber.

To suggest, as you did, all religions are the exactly the same, inspire equal behaviour as all other religions and that one can just put down any religiously motivated behaviour as easily attributable to any other religion is false and at worst dangerous.

As for the actual subject of the video, as a cyclist in London I agree with a lot of what he says, but the red light jumping is a problem. I rarely jump red lights, only time I tend to do it is really when it feels dangerous not to (for instance if I am at a cross road and wanting to turn right with a bus/lorry coming from the opposite direction) and even then only when it is pedestrians crossing and I will wheel my bike through slowly.

I know legally that is just as bad, but I don't think it is the same as the cyclists who simply don't stop and red lights and just cycle straight through them. They are a bloody menace, and even I have shouted at them before.

Ofcourse the things you do to prevent phone theft are different to the things you do to prevent rape! Just like the things you do to prevent a fire are different to things you do to prevent car theft. There is nothing wrong with making people aware of things they can do to improve their personal safety.

&gt;You were vulnerable because, if you weren't drunk, you could watched your phone better, protected it, noticed it was gone sooner, etc. Those are all things that women can't do with their vaginas.

You are trying to imply that there is nothing a woman can do to protect herself from a rapist but that is bullshit.

If a woman (or a man for that matter) is drunk they:

 * Are less likely to notice somebody slip a drug into their drink
 * Are more likely to take risks they wouldn't take if they were sober
 * Have diminished motor skills and are less able to physically defend yourself
 * Have diminished cognitive skills and are less able to detect dangerous scenarios
 * Can be easily confused and might not even clearly remember the events of the evening

There is nothing wrong with raising awareness about these things you can do to be safe. This isn't victim blaming.

Victim blaming would be saying to a victim ""Well you shouldn't have been drunk."", or telling somebody ""If you walk home alone you will be raped"" - and that is not what is going on in the poster put out by the police.",0,1344036203,null,0,false,0,c5nudaf,t3_xmidu,t1_c5nudaf,t1_c5nteok,null,1429546750,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2
true,lol_oopsie,null,null,"I don't agree at all. Your link doesn't prove much - only that those private schools produce exceptional students that universities prefer. Private schools have smaller classes, more teacher time, longer school days, more extracurricular activities and coaching in interview technique. Even when you equalise grades, it's not surprising that private school students get in top universities more often - they're simply better, more rounded students on average. Your own link even said that the private school pupils were doing more desirable A-levels (maths, physics rather than media studies).

Universities want the best students they can get, and rightly so. ""Levelling the playing field"" by bringing the best candidates down is a terrible idea. And what's more - it is actually unfair too. To put it the other way, if I work hard, and want to help my kids get a better education, why CAN'T I pay for them to go to a better school? I can pay for a better house, a nicer car etc. We don't demand ""fairness"" in those areas.

Even if we *did* ban private schools, I could still hire a private tutor or send my kid to summer classes, interview coaching, confidence-boosting classes etc. And you can't ban foreign holidays, piano lessons, going to museums, having a home library or anything else that costs money and makes students more well-rounded. Not to mention, that whether we like it or not, there are good areas of the country and bad areas, so as long as we still have ""local"" schools, you'll still get very mixed abilities

Campaign to improve state schools, sure. I'd support that 100%. But there is zero reason to drag people down in the name of ""fairness.""",0,1344036218,null,0,false,0,c5nudf5,t3_xlatc,t1_c5nudf5,t1_c5nt29q,null,1429546751,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

That does not mean they deserved the crime to happen to them, but I think it's healthy to admit our society is not perfect, and some people are potentially rapist or worse.

It seems to me that ignoring these horrible facts can contrabute to a horrible outcome, and we shouldn't be afraid, or apologetic to admit that.

There are many important differences that make it independent and unique and I don't think they or the residents of many of the other dependencies/overseas territories would take kindly to being lumped in with the UK, even if it doesn't work out much different for them in the UK.

You may be right that it's not why the team isn't known as United Kingdom but since neither of us know for sure I think it is certainly relevant as a possible contributory factor.

The point is that overseas territories having their own teams makes no difference, as they are already not part of the UK. However it could be said that having overseas territories/dependencies in the team does make a difference as they are not from the UK, as it is now a team representing not only the UK, and so that would be an inaccurate name. Obviously we end up with an inaccurate name anyway but at least it's wrong for everyone, and I think that's why Team GB works as it's just a brand name not used anywhere else.

**Edit:** I see now in the wikipedia link you posted above about the NOCs in the different territories/dependencies.

It's very hard to say what would appeal to a newb. It's likely that she wont like it just because she doesn't want to. It might be like a soccer fan agonising over picking the one game that would convert me into a soccer fan but if I'm not receptive to it then the games would all be the same to me.

As a girl though I'd suggest you start with David Tennant because...well he is a draw card. :-)  Another thought would be to pick a new companion episode so you get him being introduced to a new person so maybe Smith And Jones.....hospital on the moon etc. Another cute one is Partners in Crime (adipose babies, Donna and the Doctor meeting up again). Neither of those rely heavily on a knowledge of Dr Who.

If you want a Matt Smith episode then maybe the 11th Hour because again it's introducing him....and Amy for that matter.  In General though I'd rather you get her warmed up with all of Tennant before springing 11 on her. He is great but the storylines might be a bit too much hassle for a newb.

I saw ""Vincent and the Doctor"" suggested, and it is good but it's probably not the one I'd go with. It's significantly more emotional than your average episode. Not the Christmas episodes because they just aren't that great except the first Tennant one but that's a bit complex for a newb. I can't believe people are suggesting Blink....yeah it's wonderful but hardly representative of a regular episode. It's like saying The Lodger is your average episode.

Just don't show her any Colin Baker episodes. :-)

But yeah, keep your expectations low. If she watches and doesn't like it then thank her for giving it a go.

true,thepurplepony,mcgann,McGann,"Well, considering the Doctor always avoids physical violence (the best he can) I can see a Doctor Who game looking like a lot of puzzle solving. And, of course, time-based stuff. In particular, I think of the way time travel went in The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. Depending on the current event happening, you could go backwards a certain amount or forwards but have a time limit running.  

Probably lots of clue items scattered around the area you can go around. Items from past missions may not come into effect until later ones. And you might need to revisit old missions to use new items and get a different ending? This keeps reminding me of Majora, since there could be so many little intricate time-based events that, depending on how you respond to them, will put you somewhere else.  

Regarding the companions, they'd probably be NPCs. Wherever you would go as the Doctor, they'd follow and all that. I'm sure they would be able to help along the way (turning knobs and stuff to help you get across a room or something) but playing as them would probably be minimal.  

My last thoughts are your health meter. Likely the Doctor won't be fighting much or at all, as I said, so dodging is important along with keeping health up. It'd be funny to have health items resemble a favorite food (depending on which regeneration), like jelly babies for 4, bananas for 10, etc.

That's sadly not going to change, as most people here just simply don't have any interest in the classic series because it's 'outdated' or 'far too long'.

I don't think the 2-parter took away anything from the original weeping angels since the scavengers and ability still exist, they just expanded upon their abilities and made them more lethal. Giving a good amount of there motive in the 2-parter it's not a big assumption that they would still use time displacement on people just for fun since they love to cause fear. 

I'm hoping the new episode is a healthy mix of the old and new angels with some new terror thrown in.

Do you mean the Tennant specials?  Either way, Donna is both a timelord and a human trapped in a human body with a human mind. The way I read the situation, Donna could not handle the mind of a timelord inside of a human mind simply because she was too primitive. So in order for her to live, the Doctor had to erase all of her memories so her mind wouldn't blow a fuse. 

So besides being the only human/Timelord hybrid ever created (not counting the human Doctor in the other dimension), there isn't anything special about her.

When the Tardis is about to be destroyed the hand 'activates' and pours the energy into Donna and some bounces back into the hand creating a human/timelord metacrisis if i recall the name correctly. So Donna becomes half timelord half human. But since it is impossible it starts to kill Donna so that is why the Doctor wipes her mind. The defense the Doctor leaves her with activates when she remembers her adventures and knocks her out and anything around her. She is just a normal human with a defense system to step her from frying her brain. Not explained in the best way, if you have any questions i'll try and answer them.

Whilst it is unfair that men can't actively take part, there are other ways they can raise money.

if it's a problem with the charity itself... then they should mention that rather than focusing on a single activity.

But quite frankly, I am still astonished at some of the other comments on that article. Personal feelings aside, there was one genuinely bitching about the number of people declared bankrupt men vs women! Totally off-topic &amp; just derailing the entire point with unrelated 'oh women must all be stupid, unable to manage their own finances' and quite honestly removing the chance of any woman taking the content seriously.

Chaps... a little bit of practicing what you preach &amp; deleting any comments that far off topic would garner you far more support, from otherwise sympathetic women.

I DO think that they shouldn't be allowed to ban men... even if they end up running a separate event, at least it would be a start (although I would just open it to everyone &amp; use it to target obesity at the same time), but whining about how all women suck, is not going to convince them to do anything &amp; won't highlight any awareness for mens cancers.

Amy, on the other hand, was 'abandoned'. She didn't ask to be left alone, and she didn't know where The Doctor and Rory had gone off to. She was promised, and believed, that the two would come and save her, and they never did. Then, for 36 years, spent every day fighting for her life, and trying to stay alive. Also, unlike Rory, needing food and shelter to stay alive. I, for one, don't blame her for giving up and becoming depressed over the idea that she was abandoned.
