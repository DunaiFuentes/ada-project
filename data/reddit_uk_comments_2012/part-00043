From a muslim perspective? A muslim perspective as in a shared perspective shared by muslims in the UK? 

A muslim should have the same view anybody else has in this country. 

The vast majority of muslims in this country have a perspective that they want to protect this country and the people within it because they are citizens of it and have their mosques here. 

Why is this their perspective? Because think about how many muslims we have here, millions? We never hear about suicide bombings here, except very rarely. 

If, however you're talking about a muslim website preaching hate for our culture and way of life because we have soldiers in the middle east and parts of Africa and hinting @ jihadism, or outright demanding it.. that's no different from me telling you to kill somebody because I don't like them.

I can give you my opinion though, I was heavily involved with regional youth politics when I was your age (about 5 years ago) and have worked in Westminster for my MP (who doesn't really represent my view but a job is a job). Certainly others will disagree, but this is my opinion although I'm not as informed as others, who I hope will correct me if I have anything wrong.

It is HUGELY unlikely that parties such as the DRP will become popular (read in government)in the UK without a change to a system of voting other than first past the post, which is unlikely in the short term due to the recent vote going against AV. UKIP (900,000) and the BNP (500,000) both received decent shares of the national vote in 2010 but did not manage to put MPs in Westminster. They do, however, have MEPs in Europe (12 and 2 respectively) due to the difference in the electoral systems. Basically, in the current format it is very difficult for minor parties to get enough seats that they will matter at all. 

The Greens actually got less national votes overall in 2010 but do have an MP in Westminster, Caroline Lucas of Brighton. If you like the DRF then I'd have thought that the Greens would be closest to your political mindset.

I doubt that the Lib Dems will ever be in government again in my lifetime, they are currently more despised for selling their souls by large amounts of their former supporters than the Tories.

Labour is pretty much unelectable in its current format with its current leadership. I'm looking forward to the time where Ed Miliband fucks up and leaves and the party has David Miliband and Chuka Umunna at the helm with decent moderate centre-left policies.

There is no party that perfectly represents what I believe in and politics is always based on compromising your values.

If you are interested in democratic reform in a wider sense then the electoral reform society are pretty much at the forefront (http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/) although they aren't a political party. My advice to you would be to ask your MP if you can spend some time in their office if you are interested in politics, it is very rare that they say no to someone from their constituency.

Also I'd remember that just because you hear the government sucks, doesn't necessarily mean it is true. Some people are ridiculously tribal about politics such as those who always vote Labour despite it no longer resembling the original Labour movement, just because they hate the Tories. Try to look at politics in a pragmatic (and cynical!), rather than tribal way if you want to get a real understanding.",0,1334443000,null,0,true,0,c4cbeel,t3_s9c7t,t1_c4cbeel,t1_c4cb6eq,null,1428722203,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"I'm sorry to be blunt, but you clearly don't know much about anarchism as a political ideology.  What you appear to be addressing might be called libertarian or anarchistic tendencies, but it doesn't sound much like anarchism.  Anarchism means no rulers, it's a set of theories of political organisation based on ending both the State and, crucially for the purposes of this conversation, capitalism and other oppressive hierarchies.  You can't have no rulers if you go to work for an employer, if you live in a patriarchy, if the economic system is predicated on private property, racism and empire.  Capitalism also absolutely requires and is dependant on a State, indeed both in the UK and the US the framers of those systems of government were explicit about the function of this to protect the property of the wealthy minority from the poor majority, it's also contained within the works of Locke, Mill and Adams.  [This is why anarchists refer to ""anarcho""-capitalism as anarcho-Statism](http://struggle.ws/anarchism/writers/anarcho/anarchism/libcap/refuteAC.html) as it makes as much sense to us as anarcho-Fascism (I believe a few of those oddballs exist on the Internet as well, but, like the ""anarcho""-capitalists, not so much in real life).  

There's a modern movement of right wing small government types in the US who've succeeded in coopting the term libertarian from the left (something they [did consciously and are quite proud of](http://anarchism.pageabode.com/anarcho/mutual-aid-parecon-right-stealing-libertarian)) and twisting it into something which is far from its roots and looks more like robber baron corporatism on steroids.  They are now trying to achieve a similar end with the word anarchism, linguistic and historical revisionism is one of the right's fortes. But again, Rothbard, who is often alleged to be the founder of ""anarcho""-capitalism, was [once explicit that they were not](http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/rothbard-we-must-therefore-conclude-that-we-are-not-anarchists).

Both Nine and Eleven (and I believe Ten at some point) say that there's no such thing as an unimportant person, and yet in Ten's tantrum with Wilf all he does is say how unimportant Wilf is and how he could do ""SO MUCH MORE"".

The Doctor's never been one to cling onto life. Yes, he's been afraid of regenerating before, but it's never been crippling. 

In fact, it almost feels like the Doctor's got a bit of a death wish, and I can see why he would. He intended to die in The Moment so when he came out alive he had this bizarre fascination with death and choosing whether or not to let it happen (Titanic, Kennedy Assassination, Krakatoa, The End of the World). In Rose he shows very little care for his own life, casually saying he'll probably blow himself up.

He's never really *been* afraid of death in the truest sense of the term. And yet Ten shows a shocking amount of cowardice and fear in his last moments.

The general practice of referring to universities/higher education institutions as 'schools' is an Americanism.

A lot of what you have said clears a few things up for me. I will certainly look into spending some time looking into politics, in the hope that maybe my initial impression of things was wrong. Maybe a new voting system is in order, perhaps an overhaul to the democratic system. Someone else* in the thread mentioned compulsory voting, and in the long run, it seems like that would be excellent. The more political awareness people have, the easier it makes democracy. 

Lib Dems also pissed me off with the way they handled those student fees, which is very soon going to affect me. And even I can tell that Labour has changed it's game considerably from where it used to stand, although I'm not fully aware of the reasonings or the leadership. The Tories though? They're far too capitalistic for me, I like the NHS and other services that Labour fought so hard to get to the working man all those years ago. It honestly leaves me feeling lost about who to vote for, which is why I mainly looked at these smaller parties.

Someone else also mentioned The Green Party, so I'm going to do a bit more research into them too. But a lesson has been learned, it doesn't hurt to be cynical in politics.

May I ask for your personal opinion on the BNP and UKIP? I've always seen these as fairly racist and classist parties. And I don't want to see these representing or running the country in the slightest. And, if you'd be obliged, maybe what sort of political mindset you have?

I've heard that it refers to treason, but I haven't actually seen this confirmed by reliable sources.

&gt;I've read that the Qu'ran says to kill non-believers

For 2:191-193, notice that this refers to reciprocal action; this also refers to the concept of fitnah which is pretty complex (and one of the more central concepts I feel uncomfortable commenting on because I'm still relatively new to this). As you already said, mostly it refers to fighting, which makes a lot of sense in the historical context, of the time and also has to be seen in the context of Islamic warfare (which has pretty strict rules Western warfare seems to ignore a lot of tie time regarding women, looting, civilians in general and such). 

&gt;Tabari 9:69

This is honestly a source I've never come across; it looks like an ahadith collection, but it's not an authentic one - the places that Google prings up for the hadith you quoted are highly Islamophobic and I can't quickly find it in any of the authentic books; I personally don't even go anywhere near any that aren't Bukhari or Muslim. I'd also not recommend ahadith exegesis because it's something even some pretty renowned Islamic scholars don't do because it's very complicated. 

&gt;Christianity in Great Britain (Let's leave N.I. out of this ;) is pretty docile and non-violent compared to even the U.S. (where it may not encourage violence, but does strongly affect opinions politically, perhaps because there are more Christians there).

Convenient how you just leave N. Ireland out, heh. I do get your point. I also know you're not making a point about Islam in general being more violent (with some of the stuff in Christianity's past that'd be pretty foolish). Actually, I could post some stuff here about how Christian nations in the present have this habit of killing of *a lot* of Muslims, but I won't get into that either because I don't think it's entirely relevant.

&gt;I don't for a second imagine that all, or most, Islamic immigrants to the UK are terrorists. But some (a few) are or do become terrorists, and can cause massive damage. It would have been great if we didn't have to deal with the problem of Islamic radicalisation in the UK, and could have concentrated on improving our society. What a problem to land ourselves with.

I don't think it's as relevant as the media portray it. They just really like to use the words Islamism and terrorism together at the moment.

That being said, I think there''d probably just be something to replace it. Threats from within exist (and yeah, terrorists too!), I can just go and say that I've personally never met one who was religiously motivated (I did meet a retired RAF operative at a random underground station once - RAF as in the 1970s terror organisation). 

I get how you see this as an extra problem we're burdening ourselves with.

Okay, just screw this - I'm gonna cut this short and just say that I really prefer to live in a place that's diverse, I also prefer to live in a place where I can practice my religion without having to jump through hoops to do it and you clearly disagree with that. I think we probably both have a point and it just comes down to personal preference.

Whose preference is the ""right"" one is probably neither possible to determine, nor going to convince anyone here, so I guess I'm throwing in the towel?

Bear in mind I come at this from the perspective of a mechanical engineering student with a horn for the history and evolution of engineering technology including aircraft.

If there are 20 airframes found, thats fantastic. A lot of modern vintage aircraft dont contain much original material as things break over the years and get replaced, you typically run into the Ship of Theseus problem pretty early on, not counting catastrophic accidents. I know that before now at least one of the hurricanes of the BBMF burnt up after a landing and essentially had to be rebuilt from scratch.

 If the conditions of storage are right (low humidity, constant ish temperature, no rust) then you might have the choice of recovering 20 airframes for restoration or very optimistically you might be able to assemble say 3 or 4 aircraft using the best original parts of the 20 after using modern replacements for rubber seals that are likely to have perished.

In terms of it being ""The most important plane in aviation"" its probably the most important british plane. Throughout the war the basic airframe was constantly upgraded with new engines, weapons and equipment as we played an arms race against the luftwaffe's upgrades to the Me109, Focke Wulf 190 and other fighter/interceptors. By 1945 there was little that was common with the 1939 version of the aircraft and it was only then that Supermarine decided to part with the Spitfire name and start calling the next version the Supermarine Spiteful.

As the go-to fighter for six straight years in all theatres it certainly deserves the accolade based on utility. Technologically (where we start to run into jet engines) theres a few other aircraft that come to mind as being significant. The Supermarine Attacker is visually a very striking aircraft as straddling the piston and jet ages; the fuselage is aerodynamically formed for a jet engine but the straight (not swept) wings are those of a piston powered aircraft.

The first british jet powered aircraft wasnt the Meteor (although that was the first operational implementation), but the [E28/39](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloster_E.28/39), a test bed for the first centrifugal gas turbine (As a side note, as far as I recall Martin-Baker, the ejection seat manufacturers still fly a couple of Meteors as test aircraft).

Even then, the germans beat us into the air with the Heinkel 178 that flew a couple of years earlier with an axial flow turbine. The axial flow turbine that powered the ME262 and its mounting is a [fantastic piece of engineering for 1944, adjusting the shape of the inlet/outlet nozzles according to different conditions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Jumo_004#Technical_description_and_testing) that arguably is the forerunner of the same kind of variable geometry inlets that you eventually see on aircraft like the SR71 blackbird and Concorde. 

All in all, I'd rather see some aircraft from 1945 to about 1965 being discovered, renovated or just given more attention. In that period there was a frantic scramble to consolidate a lot of the rather slapdash technical advancement that the war brought about and you had a lot of aircraft that were either flatout thought experiments, weird aircraft straddling the propellor and jet eras or aircraft that were obsolete as they went into service as the rapid pace of progress passed them by. Its a fascinating period showing a very quick evolution of technology and it is from these forerunners that a lot of modern aircraft owe themselves to.

true,comorbid_crocodile,null,null,"Physics major here: before we even think about transdimensional engineering, we need to confirm the *existence* of higher dimensions than the four we currently are certain of.  (LokianEule is correct, we currently have no known way of making dimensions.)  Only then could we begin to observe and collect data on them so as to learn how to construct devices that exist within them.  Also, while string theory predicts up to 22 possible extra dimensions, most of them are predicted to be folded in on themselves so tightly that they only exist on sub-atomic scales.  So, I don't believe there is much hope to this approach.  

If I were to start growing a TARDIS (and I have thought about this, heh) I would start investigating the properties of photons.  According to Einstein's Relativity time slows as the velocity of an object increases relative to the observer.  Photons travel at the maximum velocity possible, the speed of light, and hence they do not experience the passage of time at all.  While us slow-moving creatures may see them streaking by as time passes, from the photon's perspective it simply exists everywhere, always.  And since the rebooted series describes the TARDIS as a living creature, I'd like to imagine it is an intelligence built of photon or photon-like particles.  How we would build a control room 'on the creature's back' (I think of it as placing a saddle on a horse), I'm not sure, because as soon as particles have mass, they require an infinite amount of energy to accelerate to the speed of light.  At this point, I would start looking into materials that we know exist but haven't yet determined their properties: namely, dark energy and dark matter, to see if one of them could do the trick.

TL;DR:  According to our current knowledge of physics the existence of a TARDIS-like creature is next to impossible, and it is certainly impossible to build a room on its ""back"" that could carry a being with mass.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Populist, ill-considered waffle.

I'm, from the perspective of most, something of an animal rights nut- and even I cringed at their policy there. I even *agree* with it- I'm just left cringing by the slapdash presentation.

Their policies on ""democracy"" read like they were composed by a sixth former- a basket of every vaguely populist-liberal talking point of the past decade, without a modicum of consideration for how the British political system works- or, indeed, how our constitution got to where it is today in the first place, and the value of said process.

If you want an answer to your question, I'd suggest reading serious newspapers more often- and perhaps getting involved with a party at the local level. University's a fantastic time to give politics a proper go, if you're heading up there in the nearish future. Actually engaging with the process itself's enough to open your eyes.
For what it's worth- if the vague talking points passing for policy being thrown about by this party chime the right notes with you, I'd suggest giving the Liberal Democrats a good look. Try not to get whipped up into a frenzy of hatred by the movements against them- what they stand for, and their structure as a party, might just appeal to you. Certainly, being involved with them's quite an eye-opener into how political parties work- the fact that you'd be observing the party in the midst of its worst crisis for decades wouldn't hurt, either.

In short? The DRP seem to be throwing around policy proposals willy-nilly without even a play towards giving the issues in question serious, *deep* consideration. Politics is too serious a business to be left to amateurs like that.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans/companions along with him to see alien worlds and history. We've had approximately 784 episodes (32 seasons) but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in nearly anywhere.

The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a you will like. Don't like the eleventh Doctor? Try the tenth! Also, Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 (seasons 1-26) then relaunched in 2005 (seasons 27-32/series 1-6).

But by no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv, then I can give you this guide I wrote...). You should choose the 2005 point.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

And no matter what you do, watch all six series. And if you like them, there's always classic who... :D",0,1334467129,null,0,false,0,c4cfeoc,t3_sah0x,t1_c4cfeoc,t3_sah0x,null,1428724092,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

&gt; I'm also a bit confused about Liverpool's need for Comolli.

It was also that at the time, our owners came in with zero knowledge of the sport. Aside from just being a DoF, Comolli would have served as a valuable source of experience, not only in football but also in the PL. Also his supposed 'connections' with Billy Beane, of 'moneyball' fame, probably made him an appealing option to FSG/NESV.

&gt; At least 8 players were home grown.

Yeah, you're right about this. I'm hoping that the transfer strategy was that last summer's signings were to form a ""home-grown base"" for the squad, to which foreign acquisitions could be made.

&gt; Torres had just been sold for 50m - the whole world knew that this money was going to be spent on new players

That's why Newcastle forced us to fork up 35m if we wanted Carroll. But remember, in that window we bought Suarez for 22m, and sold Babel for 7m; so the net spend was 57m (Suarez, Carroll) as was the net income (Torres, Babel). Obviously that's a bit simplistic; all other sorts of fees come into it - but our over-paying for signings last summer had nothing to do with Torres anymore.

true,Kim147,uk,British Sandgroper,"There some basic facts of life that any organisation undertaking surveillance has to keep in mind :-

1) cost - if everyone is being monitored then that requires a massive number of people doing the monitoring . Then who is monitoring the monitors ?

2) false positives - this is a massive problem - if , for example , phone conversations are being monitored automatically by computers - speech analysis software - and the word ""bomb"" is heard - is this ""bomb"" , ""BOM"" - Bill Of Materials , or ""bombe"" - eg. [Bombe Alaska](http://www.google.co.uk/search?tbm=isch&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=628&amp;q=bombe+alaska&amp;gbv=2&amp;oq=Bombe+Alaska&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=g4g-m4g-S2&amp;aql=&amp;gs_l=img.1.0.0l4j0i5l4j0i24l2.1368l1368l0l2889l1l1l0l0l0l0l122l122l0j1l1l0.frgbld.) ?

3) decision points - what is being monitored and why it is being monitored - why is it a problem - ie. what are societies' 'values' in this respect . 

4) what are the effects of the monitoring on society .

5) where the monitoring can be misused . This can be in two areas :- i) the 'neighbourhood spy' who is just being political or just plain nasty , ii) private companies - individuals using the information for private gain or the corporation itself using the information for profit or political gain .

Basically the best way to ensure that it isn't misused and it doesn't get out of hand is :-

1) to make it evidence led - ie. not based on fishing expeditions .

2) to ensure that there is sufficient oversight - search warrants etc. .

3) to make sure that it is sufficiently limited so that the information is of value .

Then devolve to England. We can have a separate parliament somewhere outside of the South East, and Westminster can be reserved for defence and foreign policy.

* Darien scheme (1698 financial bubble, followed 20 years later by the UK's own South Sea Bubble)
* Independence will have implications outside Scotland (reference to Catalans, despite Spain stating they see no similarities)
* Arguments for and against can be emotional (fair enough)
* 65% of Scots would vote yes if given Â£500 ([same poll](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-16024399) also reported that, removing the economy, support had grown from 24% in 2007 to 32% today)
* Scotland either ""subsidies the union"" or is a ""subsidy junkie"" (we contribute about 9.6% of UK revenue and receive about 9.3% of expenditure: so that's a 0.3% ""subsidy"" to the UK; the ""junkie"" argument is that with 8.4% of the population that 9.3% is 0.9% too high)
* Both of those arguments are wrong (yes, I think so)
* Scotland would be vulnerable to the price of oil, and eventually it will run out (true, although waiting until it does run out wouldn't make Scotland *less* of a ""small, vulnerable barque"" in a ""stormy economic world"")
* Scotland couldn't have bailed out RBS, and would need to shrink its financial sector (very true, although you could argue that it's hardly Scotland's fault that the UK's financial regulator failed to do its job when it came to the largest banking takeover in UK history)
* Scotland would need to enter a monetary union with the UK, without a fiscal union (not particularly dangerous IMO, given how connected the Scottish and rUK economies are how plausible is it that UK policy will diverge wildly?)
* Scotland might not get automatic entry to the EU (scaremongering IMO: as plausible as saying that the UK would no longer be a member since dissolving the Act of Union means the kingdoms in 'UK' are no longer united. After the [bladder-veto](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16104275), the UK may have less influence on the situation than we might once have had)
* The SNP were in thrall to Ireland/Iceland's economic miracle (as were most politicians at the time)
* The SNP have since emphasised Nordic links (true, although specific politicians are not really important IMO: this should be about the next hundred years, not the next 10)
* The SNP are promising a land of milk and honey, but might not be able to pay for it (true: there are no guarantees in life, but I think the conditions don't look particularly bleak either)
* Scotland would need to compete against the UK economy (true: every country needs to compete against each other, but the EU's single market has shown cooperation can also be extremely profitable)
* If you value independence due to a desire for self-determination, you should go for it (agreed)
* But remember you might end up as a ""vulnerable, marginal economy"" (or perhaps you won't: you can argue that smaller is weaker, or you can argue that smaller is nimbler and more responsive)
* Edinburgh was once praised as being like Athens, but now Athens is a bad thing (bit of a cheap shot)

The time in that parliament would be 100% dedicated to discussing issues relating to individual regions within England, without the added cost of discussions on national budget, foreign and economic policy that take place in Westminster. The Parliament would be representative of enough of the population to pack a punch in terms of influence. When Scotland and Wales don't get their way, they can just threaten to secede. A regional assembly would have no such equivalent power, and could safely be ignored if it started making a fuss.

true,bluefold,null,null,"I watched the riots quite closely via twitter and other social platforms as I knew this would eventually come up. 

Twitter: It was a mess unless you had a specific location to search by there was so much noise that it was nearly impossible to follow. Unless they were using DMs twitter was not used beyond being an advertisement for people to go riot. I picked Eltham as a place to survey as there had been talk in some of the bigger hash tags there was race riots going on. However there was so much misinformation that no meaningful could be taken from it, even for residents. It turns out that the 100s of bnp members were 5-6 shop keepers deciding to stay behind and look after their own property.

The one time I did see Twitter used effectively is during the clean up. Very quickly people organised a clean up 'mob' to help and the government even went on to praise this use of social media. Heck Twitter was even doing the polices job for them as people were dumb enough to post pictures of themselves with what they had looted.

Facebook:  This was a joke. You had the occasional person. Coming out in support but what there was in organisation was done via pages and group that were VERY quickly pulled down by the police and those threading to riot were picked up. They already had more than enough power to monitor and act on events like this.

Reddit: Provided some of most striking imagery of the riots. Everything I saw on tv or in the papers I had generally seen here first. Subs like /r/London really stepped up in providing advice to fellow londoners and tourists alike. It was the most active I have seen that sub and helped reduce the misinformation out there. There may have been a sub out there somewhere helping to organise the riots but I did not see it. Even /r/anarchy did not have all that much to say.

BBM: From what I gather BBM was used for the majority of communication between 'rioters'. The organisers would send out where the next days activity and this would be passed on. However this did not really work for a couple of reasons. To start with it got those who really wanted to do damage together but very quickly it went viral and the 'hip' thing to do. Many people were sending messages and duplicating the original messages as jokes or to try and stir up trouble in other areas. This resulted in whatever power the riots had being spread so thin and so misinformed that the riots quickly lost steam.

The thing with BBM is that even during the riots RIM gave the police full access to their servers they could see every message being exchanged if they wanted and this data has been used for many convictions.

Mass Media and the Governments response: both failed incredibly in their reaction to this. The media took this to saturation point and reported on the very worst of things happening constantly and then carried on to misinform when nothing was happening. The only broadcaster who did not over exaggerate the riots was Al Jazeera who offered a pretty unbiased commentary. Sky news had people thinking that it was the second coming and it was going to be as bad as the great fire of London. BBC were so slow to actually be useless. A story that had been on the Internet for hours would be presented as breaking news and had already become irrelevant. The government also were also incredibly slow to respond to things as they developed and let the question of rubber bullets and water cannons to go unanswered as it served their purposes to keep the threat on the table. Not to mention how long it took for reinforcements to be brought in.

The proposed laws: Those who truly wanted to cause damage and chaos were already talking under so many levels of encryption laws like this would not help. There was so much misinformation spread through social media that it became ineffective as a form of communication about the riots. Being able to snoop on this information constantly would be a massive drain on resources that could be used better elsewhere and would be just as ineffective. Those who want to will find ways of masking themselves and laws like this simply force us into a guilty until proven innocent culture.

Let's not forget that homosexuality has only been legal for a handful of years, imagine if these laws had been in place previously or while people may trust the current government implicitly (unlikely) the law is ponderous but it is ever changing, what is legal today could be made illegal tomorrow and yet people will find their rights for protest already stripped from them. 

What is worrying the government in that on one hand they must praise other groups in their use of social media  on the other hand they are afraid of what it might trigger in their country. You only have to look at the occupy protests as an example of how quickly a protest can gather steam. Imagine one with a more structured purpose that called for the government to step down or something. 

The money he would be spent much better in providing a place for people to go for information during times like this that is updated constantly and does not let misinformation spread. During times like what happened here the response should be nearly immediate, not three days later.

To my mind (and without wishing to sound rude) the argument you put forward with regard to slow change, power structures and tradition... is irrelevant to quite a large extent in this case. There are several ways in which Christianity holds sway or has undue privilege, but I'm not seeing how being rid of them would be so problematic or disruptive. ""one foul swoop"" - What do you foresee happening or going wrong? Let's consider the two examples I gave: The Lords and prayers.

The Lords *is* being reformed and that will likely happen soon. At present the proposal that looks like it's going through (*hiss*) is that 12 Bishops will be retained in a House of 450 Lords. The Bishops could all have been lost, in my opinion, without any real danger. If one argues that they should be got rid of *slowly* to ease the passage... Well I'd ask what exactly you think they're doing that is so important or integral that it can be got rid of but only slowly? 

Back in 2009 Jack Straw (at the time Secretary of State for Justice) made some comments about the Lords Spiritual and said: 

&gt; [""My own guess is the Church of England may come to a view (over the next ten years) that it is not appropriate for bishops to be in the legislative chamber""](http://www.politics.co.uk/news/2009/8/27/church-fights-on-as-bishop-threat-grows)

The response from the CoE was predictable in content, but rather surprising all the same in how laughably wrong it was:

&gt; ""In an age where the role of religion in shaping social and moral attitudes is increasingly recognised to be highly significant, the idea of shaping the second chamber on a purely secular model would be a retrograde step.""

I imagine you'll know the general trend of religion in the UK, in fact you've mentioned it. Adherence and following is dropping as has been for years and it will continue to do so. Religion is playing less and less role in peoples' lives save for having certain aspects forced on us. [Specifically fewer people now than ever before (apart from the obvious) describe themselves as Christian (even 'culturally') or hold it important in their lives](http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/2921/Religious-and-Social-Attitudes-of-UK-Christians-in-2011.aspx).

But if we just focus on the Christians who adhere to the *state* religion:how small would the CoE following have to be before we should decide that ""Yes OK, it's time for the Bishops to go""? These 26 *men* (I'm going to keep hammering that point - older, mainly white, upper-middle class men) are there, we are told, to represent people of all (funny that they're focussed on *all* faiths these days) faiths and none (somehow). 

Let's look at their numbers: At present the CoE has less than 800,000 regular Sunday attendees (though estimates differ depending on where you look). [However, when they dropped below 1 million](http://www.churchsociety.org/issues_new/church/stats/iss_church_stats_attendance.asp) they stopped counting just Sundays, and moved to Weekly attendance. Then when that got too small, suddenly it was important to measure monthly. Either way - their numbers are *shocking* when you consider how important the CoE is supposed to be and how much power and influence they are given as standard. I won't go into specifics but far, far more people attend football over a year (or even weekly!) than go to church, including Christmas, Easter etc.

Prayers - What would be so damaging, or why would it need to be eased out, for prayers to be removed from the start of official business? Similar to the issue of Council Prayers, government really shouldn't be promoting one particular religion over others, nor indeed should religion given such a role in the working of the state. That would be not least due to its irrelevance to proceedings! but also as I've pointed out above, most people in the country have nothing to do with it (out of choice).

As such, I'd be interested to find out why you think getting rid of such aspects in one go would be so problematic or dangerous. Remember, secularism won't result in religion being completely ignored but rather the privilege and the ""Hey these guys are pretty important what do they say?"" aspect will be removed.

With regards to your ending: I might be in the sciences, I might never have had a religion and view much of it as ridiculous... but I'm very much a secularist. I'm not out to silence religion, but I am happy to have it put in its place and I think that place is heading (more) towards ""irrelevance"". As it stands, the number of non-religious people is pretty much equal to or outnumbering the religious. Of course many people describe themselves as Christian (yay for that shitty census question) but when you consider the surveys that demonstrate how many people *don't* go to church, believe the teachings or turn to religion in a time of need: I think we can conclude that many, many people who identify as Christian simply 'aren't' in any recognisable way. No matter, because the trends are clear anyway: within the next few years the non-religious will outnumber the religious people in this country. So why are we still humouring this unelected group of people who tell us what is important to us? What I mean is: the Bishops say they are there to serve our spiritual needs, but it is clear that fewer and fewer people care about that (if indeed it's even really 'a thing'). That's not my personal opinion: look at the numbers! It might seem like sour grapes to a good many people - but it is simply *not* fair. It's not democratic. And it's not like the CoE are a 'harmless' group as many people might argue. The common or garden vicar and congregation, sure. But similar to the Catholics: The leaders are out of touch with the followers.

Consider the attitudes the CoE promotes: They are *not* in line with the majority thinking in the country. Gay bishops, for example. That's one of the reasons they're losing people too - they belong to a different time and society has moved on. Have you seen the way the Bishops have voted over various issues in recent years?

The idea of national pride and ""ask now what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country"" is something that I can get behind but not when its based upon a foundation of hating others. I think there is space in the political spectrum for a credible nationalist party, I just don't think the BNP is it.

I don't think UKIP are a bad party. I don't think we should leave the EU but I think it should be looked at how closely we are involved. I'm not an economist so I couldn't really say which would be best given the current economic difficulties, but I think in terms of sovereignty there are a few things that should be re-addressed. UKIP is also against the one sided extradition treaty with America. Nigel Farage, the UKIP leader, has made some pretty amazing speeches in the European Parliament and they are becoming more and more popular with traditional Conservative voters although they are still seen largely as a one issue party.

When it came time for my fiancÃ©e and I to get our first place together in Edinburgh we looked about and went into various agencies stating what we needed/budget etc. Grant Management showed us a couple of places and one seemed ideal, within budget and had everything we needed.

We looked online for reviews and what not of GM but all the problems seemed to be relating to student lets as opposed to professional lets so we (foolishly) assumed they would perhaps treat us a little bit better... Not so. Took almost 2 years to get a buzzing socket fixed, and 8 months to get a broken bed replaced despite numerous emails and phone calls.

We renewed our lease once as we were starting to get settled in and thought we could make it work but our lease runs out in again September and we will definitely NOT be renewing. Mainly due to a mix of Grant Management being really poor and useless and our upstairs neighbours making my life a misery.

&gt;  The royal family is the head of this class structure.

Not really - at present, they operate as a practically powerless figurehead, and are closer to being a curiosity than the head of a class structure.  There are many unfavourable things about Britain's history, but it doesn't mean we should seek to universally reject it.  For the last 100 years, the Monarchy has committed few negative acts.

Given that the class structure perseveres largely due to wealth, and hereditary lords are a vanishingly small portion of it, a more appropriate way to deal with inequality is through progressive social policies.  Indeed the Monarchy has numerous charitable connections which are relatively progressive in this respect.

&gt;  Its a stupid, outdated and bizarre system which makes no real sense any more.

Fortunately, the Lords don't have an active role in the political system and act merely as a chamber for debate and to draw attention/further consideration to certain issues.  The negative consequences of the Lords Spiritual are minimal to negligible, and the ongoing reforms are continuing to reduce their number.

The Lords is not supposed to be a democratic House, but a force of inertia to prevent a given parliament making excessive changes by forcing reconsideration by the successive parliament.

Regardless, the Church is in no way a political wing of the Monarchy, and the two do not share any political agenda.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;they operate as a practically powerless figurehead

The monarch is the head of a global church based in the UK, powerless, hardly. 

The royal family represent the head of ""the establishment"", powerless, you're kidding yourself. 

&gt;There are many unfavourable things about Britain's history, but it doesn't mean we should seek to universally reject it. For the last 100 years, the Monarchy has committed few negative acts. 

They haven't needed to they are rich beyond compare,  apart from representing Britain overseas and visiting the world, they certainly havent earned any of this money, it was handed to them by their forefathers many of whom committed heinous genocidal acts. The royal family's wealth is of the moral equivalent of the blood diamonds of Sierra Leone. 

&gt;the Lords don't have an active role in the political system and act merely as a chamber for debate and to draw attention/further consideration to certain issues.

This is nonsense Lords amendments are taken very seriously by the political system, of course this is an active role.

&gt;Regardless, the Church is in no way a political wing of the Monarchy, and the two do not share any political agenda.

We simply have no idea of the influence that the queen as the head of the church holds on the role of the bishops. It would be rather more democratic if these bishops had no influence and they were no longer represented in the house of lords at all.

&gt;if something brings in more money than it costs, and has no meaningful negative consequences, then there's no reason not to keep it around. There are also numerous social benefits to having a figurehead for people to rally around.

And there are numerous reasons why becoming a republic would make a lot more sense

1. The end of an outdated and ridiculously immoral elitist society. The 1% of the UK.

2. We could reclaim the land owned by the royal family and sell it along with the Crown estate bringing much needed finance back to the British people. 

3.  A fairer society

4. Removing outdated traditions that keep us stuck in the past. Compare the UK to Germany which has had to reinvent itself and have done very well because of it.

I'm sorry, the Royals simply have to go, its these stupid traditions that stop Britain progressing as a nation. ",0,1334497655,null,0,false,0,c4ci4hj,t3_sakyi,t1_c4ci4hj,t1_c4chz9k,null,1428725438,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt; From what I gather BBM was used for the majority of communication between 'rioters'. 

This has subsequently proven to be false, as with all of the claims of technologies involvement. The online world was reacting to the riots, it was not leading them. Various studies looked at the timelines of the messages and compared them to the riots incidents. In every case the riot was in full swing before it was mentioned online. In most cases the online information was misleading and inaccurate.

&gt; The media took this to saturation point and reported on the very worst of things happening constantly and then carried on to misinform when nothing was happening

That's not strictly true. On the second and third nights there was a complete media blackout in the mainstream press. I stayed up late and ""watched"" the whole thing on reddit while News24 and Sky News were silent. It was only after 5am that the nights chaos was reported. My assumption was that this was an attempt to limit copycats and the sheer breadth of the outlets not covering it suggested that the idea was coming from elsewhere. 

&gt; Being able to snoop on this information constantly would be a massive drain on resources

Not quite, they are not proposing bums on seats watching things live. Most modern marketing companies now have live social media monitoring capabilities looking for trends.

This is the root of the problem because the campaigning from Unionists will be along the lines of Scots hating the English for no reason and this is just not the case.

Elections over the last ten years have shown that the peoples of Scotland and England just do not share the same ideas on who should govern. All we want is to escape what is widely seen as the control of a government headed by a party we did not vote for and put in one we did vote for.

From a national perspective I like to see it as a cheeky rivalry good for a bit of banter but politically it's far more serious. If you are someone who doesn't like the Tory government or for that matter a Labour one making the decisions you must be able to relate it's just we feel that on a national level now. 

I support Independence but to a point I would also be very content with the so called Devo Max option. At the end of the day I just want my vote and my opinion to matter rather than be swallowed up and be meaningless.

There are certain data sources they are allowed to utilise and at the moment these are fairly closed and limited. The proposed powers would expand these massively. The other issue is that it's very difficult to make computer generated data *evidential*. There are still restrictions in our legal system that mean calculated evidence must be calculated by a human.

Your problem will never be delivering the data (obviously, you've got that sorted, and any one of a huge number of interfaces would do it), it will be getting the data and keeping it up to date. Until your project is vastly successful any model that depends on third-party submissions will fail. So you need to source that data. Scraping other datasources for good data could actually work, nobody's really done that successfully before on any scale. But you'd need a constant input keeping the scraping going and finding new sources. or if you get an API that others are willing to interface with, fab. With a lot of collation and data conversion from myriad different providers an inevitable part of such work, I've always had the dream of a universal event format for data exchange. 

Also, regarding scope, I'd try to choose an area and cover it all - Wales is a good and achievable start (but do make it clear to users what the area covered is). You will need to understand and research the available data, to ensure quality. Don't spread it too thin. Patchy worldwide coverage will be of little use to anyone - by contrast getting every single event in Wales would be really good, and then maybe England, and so on. 

Finally, and from my own experience, there's no hard distinction between a public walk/event, and a promotional business event. But if your programme gets successful you'll find that businesses keep trying to get inappropriate stuff into it that will in the end annoy users and give them free advertising. Product launches, pretend 'events' that are just adverts, fitness businesses doing huge series of 'events' every day, etc. So consider some eligibility criteria and how you might apply them. Indeed you'd probably want to embrace some such approaches as a potential income stream but do make sure you get your cut if you are promoting somebody else's business.

&gt;  The monarch is the head of a global church based in the UK, powerless, hardly.

The monarch simply doesn't have any active involvement in the CoE.  The politics of the church are made abundantly public by the squabbling between bishops; it's the Archbishops rather than the monarch who have any actual say or control.  The monarch is as much in control of the Church as they are in control of the Commons (i.e. a ceremonial role).

&gt;  The royal family represent the head of ""the establishment"", powerless, you're kidding yourself.

I'd say old boys clubs in the Cabinet and in the City come much closer to representing the establishment.  It's rich professionals, businesses and politicians that hold power now - not a few old land owners who mind their own business in the countryside and enjoy polo.  The royal family simply does not represent any contemporary power establishment.

If there's an argument to be made for getting rid of the Royal Family, it's that they're redundant and don't have a function - not that they're too powerful.

&gt;  they are rich beyond compare

Well now, that's just silly.  There are countless richer billionaires in the UK.  The Royal Family nominally owns the Crown Estate, but cannot manage it and has to pass the profits over to the government.  [The annual income of the Royal Family is Â£41m](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finances_of_the_British_Royal_Family), which is substantial but hardly beyond compare.

&gt;  The royal family's wealth is of the moral equivalent of the blood diamonds of Sierra Leone.

Now that's truly absurd.  The argument against blood diamonds is that people pay vast amounts of money for elite consumer items, either unaware or ambivalent to the suffering directly funded by their purchase.  How is this comparable to a bunch of broadly amicable people who have inherited wealth from a different era?

Perhaps you also think that inheritance tax should be ramped up to 100%, to make sure all the badly gotten gains of the past are filtered out?  Perhaps you think the UK should surrender all this money to the various countries who suffered at our hand?  Perhaps those countries should then redistribute wealth to the particular ethnic groups subjugated under their previous regimes?  History is a complicated beast, and it's ridiculous to start trying to rewrite it through wealth redistribution.

&gt;  This is nonsense Lords amendments are taken very seriously by the political system, of course this is an active role.

Only in so far as the points raised are seen as legitimate.  If the Lords fails to produce meaningful or palatable amendments, then it is ignored.  It cannot force an agenda, only temper that of the Commons.

&gt;We simply have no idea of the influence that the queen as the head of the church holds on the role of the bishops. It would be rather more democratic if these bishops had no influence and they were no longer represented in the house of lords at all.

If you really think the Royal Family is advancing its agenda by strong arming a small and diminishing group of Church of England clergy to abuse their vast minority in the Lords to subtly alter the House's approach to bills filtering through from the Commons then there's probably no point in trying to reason with you.  It would be more democratic if there was no House of Lords; democracy is not the point of the Lords and never has been.  In the long run it might be replaced by some form of lifetime elections, but the Bishops are no more or less valid members than any hereditary peers, and the appointed peers are in no way democratic.

As stated, the Lords only has power in so far as it is respected; it does not have any ability to force a unique agenda but only to stall those of others.

&gt;  The end of an outdated and ridiculously immoral elitist society. The 1% of the UK.

This can be achieved through social policy, a better tax system, better education, better infrastructure etc.  It will not in any way be achieved by getting rid of the Monarchy.  [Let's look how many of the 20 richest in the UK are royal](http://www.therichest.org/nation/sunday-times-rich-list/) - oh wait; none of them.  The royals do not make up a substantial proportion of the UK financial elite and are not even amongst the most wealthy.

&gt;  We could reclaim the land owned by the royal family and sell it along with the Crown estate bringing much needed finance back to the British people.

The crown estate *is* the land owned by the royal family, and the profits it produces already go towards the public finances.

&gt;  A fairer society

Well that's basically the same as your first point, so you can look at my first rebuttal.

&gt;  Removing outdated traditions that keep us stuck in the past. Compare the UK to Germany which has had to reinvent itself and have done very well because of it.

You really, seriously think that Germany is doing well because their society was crushed by two world wars?  You really think that without the royal family, British society would be in a similar state?  The differences can be accurately attributed to various post-1950 social policies in the two countries, and are in no way the result of the Monarchy.

&gt;And how exactly is selling them going to bring much needed finance since (unless you plan on selling them to overseas investors) you're just moving money around inside the banks

You are moving that money stuck in crown estates into public finances, just imagine the good we could do with all that money. 

&gt;How will they continue to produce revenue given that most of the big tourist sites like Windsor already bring a great deal of money into the country and local area in the form of tourism.

Well presumably these things would be kept as tourist attractions ensuring a continual flow of tourist income, they could offer such events as sleeping in the queens bed, sitting on the ex-royal throne, taking a shit in the royal toilet. History wouldn't change, but we could replace the stupid royal/military parades with something a bit more modern such as  dance troupes

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"&gt;  The class system is inherently immoral and an automatic place in society and access to the finest schools, colleges and jobs based on birthright is outdated and uninspiring. It would mean a fairer society.

Abolishing the monarchy would do nothing about this.  As stated in my other reply, you address this through social reform, tax policy, education policy etc.  Not by some bizarre republican movement.

&gt;  Any new republic would be based on a fairer society

What role does the republic play in producing this fairer society?  If not, why are you trying to mangle separate issues together like this?  The US has a slightly exaggerated (in terms of inequality and liberal policies) version of UK society without a monarchy, due to their similar politics not due to some monarchy related hypothetical.

&gt;  You are moving that money stuck in crown estates into public finances, just imagine the good we could do with all that money.

The crown estate is run and managed by the government, and all proceeds go towards the public finances.  The only difference would be that the government could sell the estates if the monarchy no longer nominally owned them, and this would be quite short sighted IMO.

&gt;  Well presumably these things would be kept as tourist attractions ensuring a continual flow of tourist income

All of Europe has a Monarchistic past.  The UK attracts a disproportionate amount of tourist interest because our Monarchy remains active.  Look at the vast audience drawn by the Royal Wedding, for example.  Germany has some brilliant old palaces that get almost no attention because they're empty relics.  On top of that, there's substantial interest from the Commonwealth because of a historic/emotional/cultural attachment to the Monarchy.

So we are told, and it would for a generation or two at least, we could then use the income to focusing on new tourism ideas.

A universal event format would be great (the closest we have is probably CalDAV), but until such a thing exists I'll be doing exactly as you say; scraping organisations' websites.

You're totally right about the scope. I'm looking for any suggestions for event sources but I'll be prioritising the UK until I have decent coverage here. As far as the distinction between events goes; I'm planning on moderating all submitted events when support for it is launched.

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"&gt;  The Germans, Americans and French I suspect would probably disagree

The Weimar Republic was imposed as a result of the discrediting of their monarchy at the end of WWI and was not widely popular with the German people at its inception.  The American and French republics were both in response to a powerful monarchy imposing substantial taxes and injustices upon their respective societies.  The British monarchy does not do this.

&gt;  Upkeep of big houses like this run into the millions, I suspect we could rather benefit from that cash, and use it to educate our kids or build hospitals and the like, sales could be handled sensitively, and the tourism would still flood in.

Â£15 million to be precise, as listed in the public finances of the Monarchy.  Or 0.002% of the 2012 public expenditure of Â£682b.  Or 0.016% of the income from tourism - to which I suspect it contributes substantially more.

The point is that selling the crown estate would only deprive the government of future income, so it doesn't really matter how ""sensitively"" the sale is handled.

&gt;  So we are told, and it would for a generation or two at least, we could then use the income to focusing on new tourism ideas. Those palaces remain big tourist attractions in Germany.

What income?  There is *nothing substantial to be gained by selling Crown properties* since all of their income already goes towards the public purse.  Those palaces are nothing like as popular as those of the UK.  The tower of London alone receives ~2.5m visitors/year.    Germany's most popular castle receives half that.

[London is the second most visited tourism city in the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism#Most-visited_cities_by_international_tourist_arrivals) and tourism as a whole makes up 10% of the British economy.  If you don't think that's substantially dependent on the strength of our history then you're just wrong.

&gt;  I fancy gay parades, replace the queen with another kind of queen. It could be hilarious. Gay Prides are popular all over the world, and probably represent modern Britain than some stuffy old institution with weird speech impediments.

You really think Gay Prides would be a distinguishing or substantial draw for tourism in England?  Carnivals and the like are not a major attraction for foreign tourists to the UK, and it's a bizarre desire to replace our successful tourism industry with an entirely artificial one that you perceive to be more Republican.",0,1334508418,null,0,false,0,c4cjohm,t3_sakyi,t1_c4cjohm,t1_c4cjhoz,null,1428726173,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Britain was in a state of economic depression, strikes were common, the country was in a mess, the working class youth literally had no future.

notably


&gt;It is also why Party President Tim Farron MP has said that there ""must be absolutely no question of universal internet surveillance"" and that ""if we think this is a threat to a free and liberal society... this just simply must not happen.""

be interesting to see how long it takes to retract that statement, and probably more interesting to see what fits in the ..... blank space to complete the quote

&gt;
&gt;Dear Mr thecuriousincident
&gt;
&gt;Thank you very much for contacting me about the proposals on communications data. This is an issue that has clearly generated a lot of interest, and I would like to try to clarify the situation.
&gt;
&gt;Liberal Democrats have a long and proud record of fighting to protect our civil liberties. We firmly opposed Labour's illiberal legislation while in opposition, and can be proud of having repealed much of this while in Coalition. Since entering government in May 2010 we have scrapped Labour's costly and intrusive ID card scheme, reduced detention without charge, scrapped control orders, ended child detention for immigration purposes, and restored rights to peaceful protest. This is a record on civil liberties of which we can be proud.
&gt;
&gt;There has been a lot of speculation on the proposals, and much of it has been inaccurate.
&gt;
&gt;Firstly, it should be made clear that the Government will not be able to access at will the content of emails, facebook messages, or any other communications data. Currently, the police or intelligence services are only able to access the content of communications data with a warrant issued by the Home Secretary, and this will not change. There will be no weakening of the current safeguards in place, and there absolutely will be no centralised database of communications data, as proposed by Labour in 2006.
&gt;
&gt;However, Liberal Democrats are clear that even the current safeguards must be strengthened, to ensure that every person's data is protected with the utmost security. That is why Nick Clegg has made it clear that not only will any new proposals have the ""highest possible safeguards"", but that the Government will review existing protections as well. It is also why Party President Tim Farron MP has said that there ""must be absolutely no question of universal internet surveillance"" and that ""if we think this is a threat to a free and liberal society... this just simply must not happen.""
&gt;
&gt;The full proposals have not yet been released but the motivation is to ensure only that we maintain the current capacity of the police and security services by keeping pace with the use of new communications technology, not to extend powers any further. We have made clear that the proposals will not be ""rammed through Parliament"", but will be subjected to proper scrutiny and debate. Open Parliamentary hearings will be held to examine draft clauses of any legislation.
&gt;
&gt;As a Liberal Democrat, I take issues concerning our civil liberties very seriously.
&gt;
&gt;Thank you again for contacting me about this important issue.
&gt;
&gt;Yours sincerely
&gt;

I just don't see how it's a red card if Bale doesn't bother to make the run in the first place. But if he's there to pick it up then apparently Cech has not even committed a foul on Adebayor at all.

I just don't think the rules were interpreted correctly by Martin Atkinson. As a goalkeeper, you bring down a player inside the box without touching the ball, it's a penalty and a you're hitting the showers early. 

Oh, and as well, if the ball doesn't cross the goal-line. It can't be a goal. I don't know, maybe I just don't understand the rules, I suppose he is the Premier League referee and all...

So I think the in the interim I wouldn't mind trying to shake things up and build a side with a philosophy and winning mentality.*

The last bit is precisely it. We have no philosophy. We basically just wing it. We don't have an identity other than playing attractively and defending like shit.

Is it because the same party has been the best party to rule for all of the past ten, twelve, fifteen, twenty years? or for some other, more idealistic reason?

Sure, the tories are currently in power. But were things fantastic under Labour? hell no. And Scotland still voted for Labour in droves.

As for the riots....
I have never seen police stand back from a crime and that is what happened, they stood and watched. 

There is something else to those riots that isnt being told. 

I know the enmity between the police and the people of tottenham, it isnt one way, its both since the previous riots and the decapitation of keith blakelock, the police always blamed the community for covering up. 

2011 same situation, black man gets killed in a similar way to cynthia jarrett, the media print outright lies about mark duggan the next day, the family and community leaders go to tottenham police station to find out what had happened and are stonewalled. This situation was always going to lead to a riot. The Tottenham community would never accept one of their community being murdered by police without a good reason. 

Now then the riots happened and I think the first night at least the people in Brixton came out in sympathy, and then it became a free for all. 

Four days of police doing nothing and London burning before they get their act together, I accept that once they had spread their options were limited. In which case, why wasn't the army brought in.

There are too many questions for me for last years riots to make any sense at all.

The fact the Mark Duggan case isnt yet resolved still leaves too many unanswered questions.

Why did the police stand back. Why were they not arresting people on the spot and tieing them up, with cable ties or whatever? 

Was it allowed to happen in the way it did to get the worst criminals in the capital off the streets in time for the olympics.

Was it a ploy to stimulate the economy by getting money out of insurers bank accounts into the real economy. 

They may sound like conspiracy theories and these arent statements but questions.

I know at the time the police were facing a showdown with theresa may about cuts. 

London went crazy for a week, we know what triggered it, but the polices actions didn't make sense to me at all. They let it happen and that doesnt make any sense at all. 

The Daily Fuck Face reported that the police were ordered to observe? 
I mean what the actual fucking fuck. None of it makes sense at all, and there is something else, we may never find out, but by doing nothing they were encouraging the rioters.

The period of suspension would be for eight consecutive Sundays during the Olympic and Paralympic Games, beginning on 22 July 2012 (the Sunday before the opening ceremony) and ending on Sunday, 9 September 2012 (the date of the closing ceremony of the Paralympics).

I'd go for an old-fashioned 4-3-3, like so:

Cech; Ivanovic, Cahill, Terry, Cole; Essien, Ramires, Lampard; Torres, Drogba, Mata

Cole needs a good game. His form this season has dipped and he needs to respond well.

Mikel has been fantastic but I prefer Essien, despite the recent poor form, because he has more pace, more tenacious, better tackler and would do better against Barca's fast-paced passing and possession football, in my mind.

Ramires and Lampard are also good at it. Ramires is ideal because he could run and press Barca hard for hours if needed. Lampard is pretty under-rated in terms of his defensive skill.

If we can press hard and make their possession uncomfortable, we'll do well. Mata alongside Drogba/Torres up front should provide a player comfortable in possession with good vision and range of passes for two hardworking players. If Drogba, Torres or both play I can almost guarantee you a hardworking, spirited performance from both.

The reason that you sense a lot of animosity from most of us at [/r/chelseafc](/r/chelseafc) towards [/r/soccer](/r/soccer) is because there is a pretty clear bias against Chelsea-related posts and comments in the subreddit. Over the course of the past year or so of my posting in r/soccer, I dont believe that I have ever made a pro-Chelsea point or posted a pro-Chelsea link that has not been downvoted to oblivion. I even go out of my way to post fairly non-controversial comments (i.e. we won by 4 goals, I thought we played great today, that decision was questionable), but to no avail.

The fact that these posts are downvoted so often and so harshly has led me to quit posting in the subreddit. I know that many other Chelsea fans have done the same.

When you consider the relative size of some of the major soccer-related subreddits (r/chelseafc has 1400 subscribers, r/barca has 1428 subscribers, r/reddevils has 1596), it is clear that we proportionally have a similar number of fans on Reddit to any other club. The only sides who really dwarf our numbers are Arsenal, who at r/gunners have 4164 subscribers, and Liverpool, who have 2669 subscribers at r/liverpoolfc.

In r/soccer, as I am sure you have noticed, there is a relative scarcity of fans sporting the Chelsea FC badge. There is a pretty obvious bias against our posts, and quite often (though not always), our posts are downvoted multiple times before anyone even gets a chance to read them. This is why you scan the majority of comment sections in [/r/soccer](/r/soccer) and most of the top comments are from Arsenal, Liverpool, Barca, Man U, or Real Madrid supporters.

I don't have a problem with posting something and it being downvoted if I make a stupid point. I do have a problem with listening to some of the drivel that fans of other clubs post and then seeing the comments of myself and some fellow Chelsea posters wiped from the record because a bunch of Arsenal/Man U/Liverpool/Barca fans would rather continue the circlejerk and keep us from having any say.

As for what you as mods could do about it, that is a tougher one to hammer out. I do not know enough about the moderators to make any claims as to their complicity in the giant circlejerk. I do know that other subreddits, such as [/r/NFL](/r/NFL) have had similar problems in the past and gotten past it with a bit of CSS. Check out this post for example, and hover over the downvote arrow: http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/sax51/eli_manning_to_host_snl_on_may_5th/.

I realize that you and the other moderators may view this as some ridiculous persecution complex, but it is real enough that we at [/r/chelseafc](/r/chelseafc) regularly discuss the problem, and many of us have chosen to stop posting in the subreddit because of it. If a subreddit like [/r/nfl](/r/nfl) that is full of rivalries and fandom just as intense as those rivalries in [/r/soccer](/r/soccer) has managed to get around the problem, I think that a more proactive stance from the moderators at [/r/soccer](/r/soccer) could help as well.

Even if you discount the collateral damage, this shouldnt have been allowed to happen purely on the basis that the police were unable to disperse a crowd that large with the 50 odd officers they had on hand. If anyone in the crowd of drug addled ravers got into a serious fight they would have been unable to prevent it from escalating and people could have gotten seriously hurt.

You've clearly misinterpreted just how much damage this crowd have caused and have also taken the liberty of making several sweeping generalisations about the incident that I have corrected. I'm sorry if it's a little annoying being set straight but you said something that was obviously wrong and all I have done is corrected you. There's no need to cry about it.

If you began with Series 5-6, go back and watch 1-4. No brainer.

If you've been following on Netflix you've likely missed Planet of the Dead, A Christmas Carol, and The Doctor, The Widow, and The Wardrobe. You should likely see those if you haven't.

For Classic Who I recommend watching the 1996 American Made-For-TV Movie. It's a bit of a bridge between New and Classic Who, and has a nice look to it.

From there there are so many choices. You could go from the beginning with An Unearthly Child (although that's certainly a long journey back to try and take) or leap around a bit from the best of each Doctor.

You'd have to ask someone a bit more acquainted with Classic Who for recommendations. Hope this helped! ",0,1334527502,null,0,false,0,c4cnafx,t3_sbcy7,t1_c4cnafx,t3_sbcy7,null,1428727911,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

That's *remarkably* well-preserved. You would have to not see much battle for quite some time to come out of two-thousand years looking like that.

Additionaly you have to factor in the psychological role. Rory got to travel, see new places, know that other people were around and he could talk to them.

She also didn't have the luxury of knowing that nothing powerful enough to stand against her would ever exist.

Rory was armed *with a frigging laser-hand*. And it's not like it would run out of power because it's working just fine two-thousand years later.

Look at the players that have stood out, Parker, Modric, Lennon. You can see they are playing a strict role. 

I think Harry has done a great job with the talent at hand. Remember, before Harry came along, we already had Bale, BAE, Lennon, King, Modric, Gomes and that was turned around. He added VDV, Ade, Parker and Friedel to increase the quality. 

I will admit a new manager like Mourinho could tactically can give us an edge or with personality could bring in players like Hulk or whoever.

As far as i know you can refuse as much as you want at the beginning, even under threat of losing benefits, but if you apply for a job and then refuse to take it or go to an interview they will get very annoyed and you may end up losing benefits as it shows an unwillingness to work.

While waiting for my appointments I've listened to many other people having theirs (you can learn a lot about a particular adviser and how they react to certain things from doing this, also listen to banter between them and other employees) and quite a few were just dicks to the advisers like the appointment was beneath them and the advisers weren't people doing a job.

But the way Modric has been playing these past, I dunno, 10-15 games he hasn't been up to his potential. I can see us selling him if Chelsea/City/United comes in with a big bid - as long as we have found someone else with potential to sign. I do not think we'll sale Bale to another Premiership side, it would be too shoot ourselves in the foot too much.

However, stills from a video are never the perfect evidence as we have often noticed. Sometimes, they tend to trick the observer. It *might* be the same in this case as well. 

What we do know is that JT lunged into the goalmouth while attempting to head the ball and felled/fouled the Spurs GK in the process. Thus, whether or not the ball crossed the line, there was a foul before that and it should have been given, thereby invalidating the goal. 

It doesn't take away from the fact that Chelsea were looking the more dangerous of the two sides at that point in time. Those who argue that it affected the outcome adversely, I wish to point out that this goal 'spurred' the opposition into scoring a pull-back - something they were (IMO) looking more and more unlikely to do as the game progressed. Thus, if anything, this 'goal' actually caused them to put up somewhat of a fight. Among the many other ifs and buts that follow this controversy, the one I choose to put forth is this: Had this goal been disallowed, would the Spurs have shown the same intensity in scoring the goal they did? I think not. YMMV, ofcourse.

The schools/local authority? Or did we cut their power and strip their numbers too much in the last round of cuts?

Of the five permanent members you have three super-powers (China/Russia/US) and the UK+France. Based on population alone the super-powers will probably remain superish-powers for another 50 years.

However there are probably going to be more countries of a similar level to the UK/France in 50 years, rather than less, so at some point the idea that they should have a permanent seat+power of veto will have to give (IMO).

Germany and Japan already contribute more money to the UN than the UK, Brazil and India contribute more troops, the US wants Japan to be a permanent member (presumably to balance China in Asia, much as France+UK were to balance Russia over Europe), etc.

After all, all kids are hungry to learn things, it's society that beats it out of them (us, actually). 

Forcing people to fit in as modern serfs in our soulless economy is not a remedy. 

Why people can't read and write at 18 is a pretty big question.

EDIT: I am not being very specific as far as biting into the ""contributing to society"" thing. Why should anyone contribute anything to society? Wouldn't society have to have something positive to offer for people to want to contribute to it? Who decides what constitutes a contribution anyway?

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; The education system is very limited and mainly appeals to the book learning types among us. If the people who ran education were intelligent and broad minded there would be a flexible system which offers something positive for everyone (EDIT: And if there was the intention to educate people rather than just train them to be compliant fodder for the capitalist machine). After all, all kids are hungry to learn things, it's society that beats it out of them (us, actually). 

Society, combined with parents and friends tbh. I think most people are familiar with the way kids who like school, enjoy classes and try to do well get bullied and taunted for being geeks or nerds. But yes, I do agree we need a fundamental reform of education which is why I have been calling for a return of modernized grammar schools along with polytechnics and vocational schools. The system we have now is entirely geared towards academic learning and it isn't suitable for a lot of kids. But this is called divisive and encouraging segregation, even though it's damn clear that the comprehensive system is not working. There is far more to education than academic work and the current attitude is doing a massive disservice to our children by refusing to even begin to question this due to a failed ideology.

&gt; Forcing people to fit in as modern serfs in our soulless economy is not a remedy. 

Depends. At the end of the day most people need to get jobs after they leave school. That can't really be ignored. But that doesn't mean that people have to just go work in some soulless mega-corp. We need to encourage people to start their own businesses, and to create jobs, rather than just hoping that if we lower our tax again someone will take pity on us. So yes, people need to be trained so they can get jobs, but that is a far broader field than we seem capable of embracing.

&gt; Why people can't read and write at 18 is a pretty big question. Actually parents probably could do more to teach these basic skills than schools but when you have a class of disaffected, apathetic people who are considered no more than inconvenient detritus by the economy, it's not surprising that they don't vale the trappings of civilisation, such as basic literacy. 

So at what point do you decide to give up on the parents and focus on the children? If you keep focusing on the parents and it doesn't work then your simply adding to the problem, so you need to focus on getting to the kids early and breaking the cycle of disaffected youth growing up and producing more children in the exact same situation.

true,citizenfaith,scottish,"Edinburgh raised, Glasgow residing","I used to work in the jobcentre for about a year from 2008-2009 and the way the system worked then  was that we had to submit jobseekers for jobs. That is, we had to note on their record that they were interested in x job. If the jobseeker then didn't apply for x job, and we found out, they got their benefits stopped for a certain period. The jobs that we subbed would come from two sources; either the jobseeker would have found a job themselves on the jobpoints and we'd sub that, or we would look for a job for them on our computer whilst they were sitting with us and sub that. There's not always time to do the latter if things are running behind so it was always a total bonus for me if someone brought over a job they'd found themselves because it meant I could sub it in no time at all and that would help me meet my target without having to actually spend time searching myself. So, the upshot is... every time you go to sign-on, get in early and try and find at least one or two jobs you're up for applying to on the jobpoints (you can bring in other jobs too but jobpoints or jobcentre website is best because those jobs have a reference code printed on them). This will give the adviser a job to sub you for, so they almost certainly won't bother spending time searching for some other job to sub you for as well so do this and you run a greatly reduced risk of having a job suggested for you which you really don't want to do. It should also make the adviser like you because you've just made their job easier so that helps too. If an adviser ever does suggest a job you're really not up for then just tell them you really don't like the sound of it. It's unlikely that they'll insist on subbing you for a job you don't want, especially if it's not the type of work you agreed to look for at the start in your jobseekers agreement. 

I also just want to stress something, and sorry if this sounds patronising but you'd be amazed how many people do this (in fact it's the main way they catch people) - under no circumstances whatsoever tell an adviser you didn't apply for a job you were subbed you for because then you'll definitely end up getting your benefits stopped.",0,1334576793,null,0,false,0,c4cukxk,t3_sc0j5,t1_c4cukxk,t3_sc0j5,null,1428731431,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,Blaidd_Dwrg,eng-lancashire,Preston,"Child benefit (Family Allowance) was originally introduced to encourage people who otherwise could not afford children to have a large family. The reason for this was that so many lives were lost during WW2 that we needed to increase the birth rate to replenish our supply of worker drones.

Clearly the original reasoning is no longer valid; indeed we're now in the opposite situation and should be thinking of ways to reduce the birth rate. Any attempt to put an end to child benefit is met with cries of ""think of the children"" and accusations of taking money away from the poor. In reality I believe it worsens child poverty by encouraging the poorest members of society to have more children that they are ill equipped to raise and have poor prospects as their deprived upbringing makes class mobility all but impossible.

I am certainly not in favour of Chinese-style controls on child birth (as a point of interest half my family is Chinese and I've witnessed the insanity of the single child policy) but paying people to make babies? It's absurd.

Having said all that I don't think Taylor's plan to take money away from people who are already dependent on it is a sensible one. It will only make them even more worse off and will perpetuate a vicious cycle.

I agree with you. However, the reason that Grammar schools are divisive is because of the way they create an elite stream within the economy. They don't change anything about schooling or the kinds of jobs people can do, they only separate out kids who can achieve a higher level in the same system. 

If we had a broader idea of what constitutes worthwhile activity and our perception of people's value went beyond their earning power then sending students to learn different things in different ways would be great. 

I think that the Grammar school system was also a one shot deal. Didn't you get picked for it based on a test you took at eleven years old? What if someone came into their own when they were 13, could they get upgraded? 

&gt;Depends. At the end of the day most people need to get jobs after they leave school...

This is all true unless you want to recognise that the way society is structured is unfair and harmful to the well-being of the human species. Diddling round with the system we have is pointless. I am hoping people would dig that this system isn't working. It provides many of us with a comfortable existence but this comes at the expense of our underclass, the environment and those pesky foreigners who are slaving away for a pittance to make our cheap sneakers and gadgets. 

I can't see any point in revolution but the more people recognise the reality of our social system, the more likely we are to adopt positive preferences. We need to transcend the money system and have options ranging from self sufficiency to small scale business. 

Yes, let's encourage small enterprise but let's also look at how we can create alternative currencies, local industries and support people who need time and space to find their way. 

Jobs, per se, in the current sense of it are an unnecessary evil. 

&gt;So at what point do you decide to give up on the parents and focus on the children?

How would you even ""give up"" on parents? It is the economy that you want everyone to contribute to which creates an underclass of people who just don't seem to give a shit about anything. I don't see why they should be all that enthusiastic about a system which is not for them. You seem to be saying that we should at least get their kids to conform to what is *your* idea of a productive life. Maybe being a petty car thief and drug addict living in a sink estate on welfare is an OK life for some people. In our shitty system, I think I'd prefer that to working in a neon-lit cubicle to pay off my semi-detached in Penge. 

So how do you give up on the parents and focus on the kids so they have a fair chance of participating in the glorious world we have laid out for them? 

Do you take them all in to care?

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"I'm not talking about some secret cabal, the conspiracy and its intent is written extensively into the historical record by those who engaged in it.  In previous posts, I've quoted extensively from Carson who provides numerous examples, I'll just review a couple of those here.  

* Under the Whigs, William and Mary introduced the Game Laws specifically to prevent the peasantry's independence.  The preamble to the 1692 Act says the ""great mischief"" the Act is intended to eliminate is the tendency of ""inferior tradesmen, apprentices, and other dissolute persons (to) neglect their trades and employments"" in favor of hunting and fishing.

* After the Tudors had appropriated great swathes of land from the working people during a particularly aggressive series of enclosures, pamphleteers noted with concern that without further large scale enclosures and until the common lands were also seized there would always be ""loyterers who will not usually be got to work unless they may have such excessive wages as they themselves desire."" Shocking stuff!

* During the last round of enclosures that precipitated industrialisation, factory owners and other pamphleteers were arguing that the only way to entrench a work ethic and stop the working masses drinking was ""to lay them under the necessity of labouring all the time they can spare from rest and sleep, in order to procure the common necessities of life.""

* Then there's the infamous Fable Of The Bees by Mandeville, which includes the following lines: ""It would be easier, where property is well secured, to live without money than without poor; for who would do the work? .... As they ought to be kept from starving, so they should receive nothing worth saving. If here and there one of the lowest class by uncommon industry, and pinching his belly, lifts himself above the condition he was brought up in, nobody ought to hinder him; ...but it is the interest of all rich nations, that the greatest part of the poor should almost never be idle, and yet continually spend what they get.... Those that get their living by their daily labour... have nothing to stir them up to be serviceable but their wants which it is prudence to relieve, but folly to cure.... To make the society happy and people easier under the meanest circumstances, it is requisite that great numbers of them should be ignorant as well as poor....""  And this was a religious man...

* Another good example at around the same time was a treatise on trade and commerce which argued: ""That mankind in general, are naturally inclined to ease and indolence, we fatally experience to be true, from the conduct of our manufacturing populace, who do not labour, upon an average, above four days in a week, unless provisions happen to be very dear.... I hope I have said enough to make it appear that the
moderate labour of six days in a week is no slavery.... But our populace have adopted a notion, that as Englishmen they enjoy a birthright privilege of being more free and independent than in any country in Europe. Now this idea, as far as it may affect the bravery of our troops, may be of some use; but the less the manufacturing poor have of it, certainly the better for themselves and for the State. The labouring people should never think themselves independent of their superiors.... It is extremely dangerous to encourage mobs in a commercial state like
ours, where, perhaps, seven parts out of eight of the whole, are people with little or no property. The cure will not be perfect, till our manufacturing poor are contented to labour six days for the same sum which they now earn in four days.

* The open fields were called ""a dangerous centre of indiscipline"" and complete enclosure was called for.  The commons were ""a breeding-ground for 'barbarians,' 'nursing up a mischievous race of people'."" ""[E]very one but an idiot knows that the lower classes must be kept poor, or they will never be industrious.""

* The Board of Agriculture report of Shropshire, in 1794, made a similar case, arguing ""the use of common land by labourers operates upon the mind as a sort of independence.""

* The Commercial and Agricultural Magazine warned in 1800 that leaving the laborer ""possessed of more land than his family can cultivate in the
evenings"" meant that ""the farmer can no longer depend on him for constant work.""

* In his ""Dissertation on the Poor Laws, By a Well-Wisher to Mankind"", Rev. J. Townsend was effusive on the boon that hunger was, a ""peaceable, silent, unremitted pressure"" driving the ""improvident"" poor to take on ""the most servile, the most sordid, and the most ignoble offices in the community"" so that ""(t)he more delicate ones are thereby freed from drudgery, and can pursue higher callings etc. undisturbed""!

* 'The Gloucestershire Survey (1807) remarked that among ""the greatest of evils to agriculture would be to place the labourer in a state of independence."" For as another observer from the same period observed,
""Farmers, like manufacturers, require constant labourers--men who have no other means of support than their daily labour, men whom they can depend on.""'

* The Board Of Agriculture welcomed the enclosures because they would ensure the landless were forced ""to work every day in the year."" Children ""[would] be put out to labour early."" Most importantly, thanks to the suppression of economic independence, the ""subordination of the lower ranks of society... would be thereby considerably secured.""

* More recently, colonialisation and globalisation has provided similar wins.  But first similar processes had to be followed in the colonies and developing nations to undermine the scarcity of labour where the potential work forces had access to land.  Thus E. Wakefield, the British colonial theorist, wrote: ""In colonies, labourers for hire are scarce. The scarcity of labourers for hire is the universal complaint of colonies. It is the one cause, both of the high wages which put the colonial labourer at his ease, and of the exorbitant wages which sometimes harass the capitalist. . . .Where land is cheap and all men are free, where every one who so pleases can obtain a piece of land for himself, not only is labour very dear, as respects the labourersâ share of the product, but the difficulty is to obtain combined labour at any price...[f]ew, even of those whose lives are unusually long, can accumulate great masses of wealth.â",0,1334579790,null,0,true,0,c4cuvjp,t3_sc0j5,t1_c4cuvjp,t1_c4cucqr,null,1428731571,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

In all fairness, he was given a really ungrateful job at Chelsea; **1)** Win the league, **2)** If not, get us to Champions League, **3)** Do well in Champions League this year, **4)** Win all the cups, and of course the most ungrateful of all, **5)** Do it with a younger squad and try to shift the generation. Then it didn't work out, and he needed the old legends (Lampard is a legend, I love him for his England duties) after all, but he got kicked out of the job. In comes DiMatteo, who plays all the old legends and gets the job done. Two different expectations, if you ask me.

true,The_Evil_Within,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"I believe Sarah Jane starts off in John Pertwee's penultimate episode, and she ends her run somewhere around half-way through Tom Baker's.

She returns once in new-Who, but she also got her own spin off that got 4 or 5 seasons in before the actress' unfortunate and premature death.  

The Sarah Jane Adventures are aimed at a slightly younger audience, which initially turned me off them, but I went back a second time and now I've worked my way through most of them.   She was a very good actress, and I'm surprised I didn't catch more of her over the years given the amount of UK television I watch.

In other words, if you can't take the old episodes because of the budget and pacing issues, there's a lot of modern Sarah Jane to watch as well.

As for visiting old friends, except for exceptions (it is Doctor Who, after all!), the Doctor tries not to cross his own timeline.  So, if he knows someone and saw them at 50, he's generally not going to go back and visit them at 40.  Amelia/Amy is obviously a big and obvious exception to this rule.   If he saw them locked into a parallel universe or killed, then that's it, he's not going to go muck about in their past for his own mental health.

It's also more or less demanded by production reality - the actors who play those old friends are getting older or have died, and of the younger, more recent ones, they've moved on to other projects and probably don't want to get locked into Who as their only acting prospect by making too many returns after they've left the main story.",0,1334589841,null,0,false,0,c4cwghc,t3_sb4ol,t1_c4cwghc,t1_c4cwc5p,null,1428732385,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Especially when big decisions like that don't go your way. Look at our first fixture against QPR. They went one up and we played with what, nine players? We didn't score on a team we could have easily thumped with 8 players - ref decisions have a direct link to morale.

However, Spurs rallied after and scored inside 7 minutes - and almost got Cech sent off in the process. They scored one, Luiz got pulled off because of an injury, and it was obvious that Bosingwa couldn't keep pace with a sprinting Bale.

Why couldn't they put another point on the sheet and draw it? Or put two more on the sheet and win?

Comebacks aren't impossible. We drew MU after what, a 3-0 lead?
Didn't Newcastle come from behind earlier this year to beat Arsenal 4-3?

Chelsea may have got a controversial goal, but they smashed 3 more in while Spurs stood around thumbing their assholes instead of rallying to fight back and win.",0,1334596192,null,0,false,0,c4cxskn,t3_sb5c5,t1_c4cxskn,t1_c4cwfnt,null,1428733022,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

The deaths of horses does not mean that the practice is wrong, it means we need to develop tighter controls and adjust existing infrastructure around the race. How often do you hear about a dog dying during a track race? Google-ing ""dog track deaths"" gives me a PETA page, and a BBC report from 2006 about some unscrupulous person putting his dogs down when they lost. 

Horses dying on a regular basis at an event in an indication that the event, and possibly the sport needs to be restructured. Stricter health checks, both pre- and post-race should be required. Stricter penalties and possibly an automatic lifetime ban from the sport for jockey and trainer if the horse enters the race and is later found to not have been deemed fit to run. The fall fences which are obviously causing a lot of problems should be removed completely, I wouldn't expect a person to be able to jump over an equivalent hurdle, so why expect the horse to.

If you get the corrected insurance document and perhaps a letter from the insurance company confirming that your car was insured at the time, then produce that, and explain the mix up in a statement to the court.

The issue for the police is that they don't know you haven't GOT insurance (only you would know that), they can only prove you didn't show any, and until you do prove to the courts you have they'll presume you haven't.

Nothing will happen if you explain the original problem, and prove that you were insured.  Could be dealt with by post.  Get it done ASAP though!",0,1334597916,null,0,false,0,c4cy6g2,t3_scfbo,t1_c4cy6g2,t3_scfbo,null,1428733197,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

From wikipedia:

&gt;Voting is compulsory both at federal elections and at elections for the state and territory legislatures. In the states of South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia voting at local elections is not compulsory. About 5% of enrolled voters fail to vote at most elections. People in this situation are asked to explain their failure to vote. If no satisfactory reason is provided (for example, illness or religious prohibition), a relatively small fine is imposed ($20), and failure to pay the fine may result in a court hearing.

So compulsory voting in Australia has resulted in ~95% turnout. ",0,1334599642,null,0,false,0,c4cyko1,t3_sceer,t1_c4cyko1,t1_c4cyga0,null,1428733384,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

All the replays released are from shitty angles. Though I still think it was a goal after watching many replays frame by frame in MPC. Even from the different angles the main thing that stopped the ball from going in was Assou-Ekotto's foot which reversed the trajectory of the ball. Nothing else was going to knock the ball back and the replay shows his foot hitting the ball. 

From the angles that are available his foot is well behind the line. Even if it is not a goal (which in my opinion it is), /r/Soccer is still circle-jerking like there is no possibility it could have been a goal.

Look at the history :-

One collapses from old age and exhaustion, and boom he's changed before you know it.

Two was changed by the Time Lords and confined to Earth. Again, he didn't know that sentence until right before it happened.

Three got zapped by a spider, although there were maybe clues with the appearance of Kâanpo / Cho-je that his time was coming.

Four fell from the radio tower, although there were maybe clues with the appearance of the white watcher.

Five poisoned by spectrox and gave the last of the antidote to Peri.

Six was due to the TARDIS crash landing.

Seven was due to being shot.

Eight was never explained, but we can surmise something to do with the time war.

Nine absorbed the vortex and only got a couple of minutes to explain to Rose.

I still feel that the emotion and words of Ten at that moment were exactly what ANY sentient being (human or Time Lord) would be feeling facing their own mortality. NONE of us want to go !

They have a tight end grip kind of thing at the end of the sleeves so you can always push them up to make the kit like a short sleeved one. Even if you do that the sleeves look better than the short sleeved ones.

This is why players look so much better with long sleeved jerseys and many don't wear short sleeves at all. Adidas kits especially look better because the stripes on many carry on.

Here is Riccy.C with and without long sleeves:

true,[deleted],null,null,"My two cents:

**KDB:**

Saw some highlights and  some blog posts regarding De Bruyne's performance. He has been shining in the midfield. He was the best player on the pitch once again (familiar theme). That's now like 8+ man of the match contender performances IN A ROW. Incredible for anyone in any league. The opposition gets tougher and he gets better. This kid is a competitor. He strikes me as the kind of player that will really shine when he surrounded with class players. 

**Kakuta:**

His performances have dipped recently (he's been solid just not Amazing) but I have been watching Dijon and I have to say...They are pretty terrible. They are sloppy and all over the place and he basically gets isolated with no support in most games. Overall as the article says, still a successful loan. I just don't see him developing anymore over there. At least the regular playing time will help his fitness. 

**McEachran &amp; Lalkovic:**

Swansea seemed like a good pick at first but in hindsight he is just surplus. They have 3-4 players who offer the same role. He is still young though so let's just be patient. We all know how good is.

Lalkovic: We gave him a one-month loan deal in the beginning of the season (crazy) and then a loan to a team that doesn't need/care for him (crazier). I think we can do a better job at negotiating these loan deals.

In my opinion both McEachran and Lalkovic should have been given 1 year loan deals to Championship teams this season. These players just need games really and the Championship offers plenty of fixtures and good level of play.

**Bruma:**

Played very well at CB earlier in the year and has been solid at RB recently. Seems to be maturing nicely this year. What do you guys think? Could he be a quality squad defender next season or should be loan again?

The poor behave irrationally because of the stresses of poverty and this damages the entire economy and limits growth - even Milton Friedman, that bastion of socialism, realised this and proposed a negative income tax/minimum income to remedy it.

It would be be interesting to see how a negative income tax system would function in practice, especially the balance between the amount you would receive from the state and the disincentive to work that would result from people simply being given money because they are alive. Ultimately, I don't think a negative income tax would work until more was done to reform the education system in order to produce people who wanted to start their own businesses or find a career that they would love.

Citation, please. The Guardian Media Group's tax avoidance gets exaggerated with every retelling. GMG have some offshore assets, but that certainly doesn't include The Guardian newspaper. In fact, registering The Guardian offshore would be an utterly pointless exercise given that the newspaper makes huge losses.

In addition, The Scott Trust is meant to keep the paper editorially independent and financially secure. The very intention of The Guardian's ownership structure is to prevent its owners from influencing the paper editorially if the stories are inconvenient. If anything, The Guardian's focus on tax avoidance stories in spite of GMG's interests is an argument for The Guardian's unique ownership structure working. Or do you think every paper should only look after its own interests and selectively avoid inconvenient stories?

Finally, it's also not inherently hypocritical to avoid tax and also think tax avoidance is wrong. Rational self-interest often differs from the collective interest, which is why tax avoidance requires a top-down solution.",0,1334604419,null,0,true,0,c4czoq1,t3_sc9t9,t1_c4czoq1,t1_c4cutp3,null,1428733903,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

On the evening in question you and all your mates gather in a location and ring the number every couple of minutes. Invariably there's a voicemail saying 'check back later'. Then, boom - the voicemail changes and it tells you to get down to XYZ ASAP. It's a race to beat the police - firstly you don't want to get stuck on the outside but most importantly it's safety in numbers - the police will confiscate all the equipment if there aren't enough people there when they arrive. No equipment, no party.

When you're there though, it's all fun and games. You make your own entertainment - with the exception of the soundsystem, that's all there is provided. Wander around, meet friends and make friends, drink the drink you bought, spend a few hours dancing, take some laughing gas and watch the sun rise with a joint. Then go home and start looking forwards to the next one. This invariably sounds like your average sanitised festival though, and really doesn't do justice to the overall experience. Without getting all loved up like a pillhead, there's something beautiful - especially in this day and age - of a few thousand like-minded people getting together for nothing but fun and enjoyment and no motivation for profit. Again, it may well be just the raves that I go to, but I've never been offered drugs for sale. There's also a constant, albeit small, feeling of risk - there are no police to save you here, no CCTV cameras and no security guards. For the first time in your life, the state has left you on your own and it's up to you to keep yourself and your fellow raver safe and look out for each other.

true,Bearasaurus,bear,Founder,"The biggest difference between back then and now is our new left side.  Beausejour was a great winter signing and gave us the crossing (albeit not finishing) threat that we needed to complement Victor Moses on the other side.  Add Maloney to the left and the two completely own that left flank.

You'll notice in the past few matches with this current formation that when we have possession but not a breakaway, we like to slow play it along the left side, doing a lot of one-two between the wingers and the midfielders.  Both Beausejour and Maloney can push forward because the entire back line will shift left and cover, with Figueroa temporarily playing LB and Boyce covering right.

In addition, Roberto Martinez's strategies in our recent matches has been stellar.  Against Manchester United, we pressed and dominated possession against an outmatched Ryan Giggs in midfield.  Wayne Rooney had to constantly drop back to try to help United keep possession, removing himself as a threat to the back line, and even then his help didn't keep us from holding the ball.

Today, facing 5 in Arsenal's midfield and very aggressive centre backs, Wigan pressed and focused more on the counterattack.  Throughout the match, even (or one could say *especially*) after our 2 goal burst, both of Arsenal's centre backs constantly pushed forward when in possession, so much that it seemed like Arsenal was playing more of a 2-4-4 at times.  This directly resulted in our first goal and should have resulted in a third on Victor Moses' breakaway 1-on-1 right at SzczÄsny.  Victor Moses and Conor Sammon (when he subs in) both have the pace to take full advantage of breakaway opportunities such as these.

Add excellent effort in team pressing on the ball, and that's why Wigan have taken 12 pts (and if not for poor refereeing at Chelsea, a full 15 pts) in the last 5 matches.",0,1334621208,null,0,false,0,c4d3c6l,t3_scr1g,t1_c4d3c6l,t1_c4d2wuv,null,1428735696,2,false,latics,t5_2tsc9,2

Because of that, and the fact that Lamps has been given the 'hes too old' treatment by AVB and the media, we get this stuff being brought up, plus Dempsey plays as a wide left midfielder or behind the striker rather than a central one like Lamps. Not to mention Lamps has pretty much changed his play style from marauding midfielder to a more deep lying playmaker, with the occasional glimpse of his natural game popping up. Which is alot more European friendly than English.

Chelsea players will almost never get the recognition they deserve in England when you compare them to the players of clubs like United, Liverpool, even Newcastle, because those teams have 'history' and our 'history' before Abramovich wasn't necesserily bad, but it wasn't in any way good either.

Most of the problems (e.g., ""I'm half-human on my mother's side"") were the results of FOX execs' meddling in the script. The BBC gave up so much in the script-writing department, that it's sad. But, that's how the collaboration process went. FOX was determined to make Doctor Who its own, which (in my book) is SO wrong.

Eric Roberts as the Master, again, not one of the writers' decisions. He seemed to be *trying* to channel Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""The Terminator."" And doing a hack job of it.

Had FOX not messed around with what the BBC had wanted originally (the ""childhood"" backstory of the Doctor and the Master), McGann likely would have had a long-lasting run as the Doctor, which I would've be pleased to watch.

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"It's something that I've noticed is very different between English and Western (US/CAN) media. 

Whenever some football star fucks up in England, be it some sort of assault, infidelity, or otherwise, they're fast to paint them in as negative a light as they possibly can. In the West, it's the polar opposite, as the media almost does its best to protect the player. 

For example, hockey players have a reputation for being dogs - common to say that they all have a girlfriend in every city (30 teams, 30 girls). You will never see or read a single story about this in a Western paper.

Remember how the media tossed JT under the bus for sleeping with Bridge's ex-wife? I can think of two cases in which hockey teammates have been rumoured to have slept with current teammates' wives. [One during the playoffs](http://hfboards.hockeysfuture.com/archive/index.php/t-328061.html) that forced the offender to retire mid-playoffs, and the other that essentially [sparked the end of a player's career](http://jesgolbez.blogspot.ca/2005/12/mike-comrietommy-salo-affair.html). Not a chance that either of these stories made its way into the papers, only rumours went around.
