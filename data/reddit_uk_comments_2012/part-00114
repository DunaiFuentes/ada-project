As I re-watch the show(revival), I've noticed that RTD makes each episode, or group of episodes, be an adventure. They then have something (i.e. Bad Wolf) tying everything together, even though those links aren't always the strongest.

Moffat, on the other hand, is all about having a huge overarching story which then pretty heavily links it all into one set of things. I often find it hard to pick up a season 5/6 episode and just watching it. I feel as if Moffat has more steadily set up episodes that are VERY clearly part of a larger story, and my brain has trouble recognizing that. 

I'm not saying I enjoy one or the other, but it's just puts the show in a different light for me.

On River's timeline, ""The Wedding of River Song"" (this version of River existing in the 5:02pm-world-that-never-was and the astronaut suit) takes place just after the epilogue section of Let's Kill Hitler.

The Wedding of River Song

The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon

The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang

Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone

Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead


There are also those small extra ""Night and the Doctor"" episodes in the Series 6 boxset, but you can probably find them on YouTube; a couple of these episodes shows the Doctor meeting a future version of the Doctor and River at their very last meeting before ""Silence in the Library"".

true,crucible,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt;Virgin made things as difficult for them as they could and once they were up and running offered to run a rival service - despite Virgin having no intention of doing it before. W&amp;S went under (it's owners couldn't keep it going) and Virgin's plans strangely disappeared.... however First are going to run services to there

Not quite. Virgin started running one train a day between Wrexham and London about a year after W&amp;S started up. It leaves Wrexham in the morning, returns at night, basically it's extended from Chester.

Arriva Trains Wales planned to run direct trains between Aberystwyth and London. Past Wrexham this would have competed with W&amp;S. After objections the Arriva plans were scrapped. The trains they planned to use were not really intercity standard anyway.

The one London train run by Virgin from Wrexham still runs, the franchise bid this time round included this as a service that had to be kept on, so yes, First will take it over.

W&amp;S's main problem was that until the end of this current Virgin franchise Virgin had a 'moderation of competition' clause written into the franchise by the DfT. This was because of the investment that had been put into the line. So for example W&amp;S trains couldn't stop at Birmingham. At Wolverhampton as you may know the rules got even weirder, they could only do something like pick up passengers for London bound trains, if you were travelling from Wrexham you couldn't get off the train there.

true,crucible,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt;I didn't realise ATW was owned by DB... do they own the rest of Arriva too?

Yeah, they used to be called 'DB Regio UK' then when they bought Arriva they renamed their UK operations 'Arriva UK Trains'.

From memory they have:

Arriva Trains Wales, CrossCountry, Grand Central (and also [Alliance Rail Holdings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_Rail_Holdings)), a 50% stake in London Overground, and the Tyne &amp; Wear Metro. Wikipedia says they also have the LNWR train maintenance facility at Crewe (through ATW, who bought it from Pete Waterman).

Their purchase of Arriva gave them all of Arriva's bus and train operations across Europe. To satisfy the EU competition watchdog they had to sell off Arriva's German rail operations, I think it went to an Italian company in the end.

Meanwhile, their freight division (DB Schenker) now owns all of the old EWS freight operator here as well.

**tl;dr:** we've sold most of our railways to the Germans.

&gt;DB could do with getting a few more franchises. Chiltern are a great company and they are involved in London Overground which is also doing a good job. That said both of them have benefited from a heck of a lot of investment

Check that Alliance Rail Holdings link... interesting. The track investment Chiltern have had would really have benfitted W&amp;S if they were still operating... it's a very moot point now though. Not travelled with Overground but the trains looked nice and shiny when I was passing through London a few weeks ago.

&gt;They've pulled it back from a laughing stock to a reliable service, I've not really had any problem with them except their prices and their trains are in need of a bit of a refresh. I haven't travelled on them since Chiltern launched their 'Mainline' service

Hmm, not sure the trains need a refresh, that said after about a decade in use maybe so. I've travelled on far worse condition trains than Virgin's.

true,crucible,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt;The Voyagers they ran to London I did not enjoy, they are very tight and claustrophobic; it is like a preparation for the London Underground. Bring any luggage and you are fucked - as any available space gets filled with people.

Personally I found there was more luggage space on the Voyager than the Pendolino, having used both in the last month. In comparison trains like the Eurostar have much more luggage space at the ends of the carriage.

Maybe it was just that we were traveling with three large suitcases though. Smaller cases seemed to fit OK.

&gt;First class on Virgin is brilliant and can really be worth the upgrade - but in the weekends Virgin did this on the cheap.

Agreed. Last year we travelled in First class on a weekend and the service was quite good. Free drinks, sandwiches, cake, crisps, fruit. This year just the free drinks and a little 'snack box', quite a difference even by weekend standards.

Even that was good in comparison to the French TGV we were on the day before though. Their weekend offering in First is literally **nothing**, not even free drinks. Basic lunch from the buffet was nearly 12 Euros, fuck that. As it was the bloody thing broke down half an hour outside of Turin anyway.

true,Scary_,null,null,"&gt;Check that Alliance Rail Holdings link... interesting. The track investment Chiltern have had would really have benfitted W&amp;S if they were still operating... it's a very moot point now though. Not travelled with Overground but the trains looked nice and shiny when I was passing through London a few weeks ago.

Interesting, some useful routes there too. Odd how these 'open access' operators are basically the big train companies with different names

One of W&amp;S's problems was the upgrade work. Some of their journeys on a weekend were just ridiculous. My partner got on one from Paddington and it went past Wembley at least 3 times. 

Overground are very good, especially compared with what there was before. But a lot of that is due to TFL's involvement and the big investment. The Olympics will have been a factor, I can't imagine Silverlink doing a service for that!

&gt;Hmm, not sure the trains need a refresh, that said after about a decade in use maybe so. I've travelled on far worse condition trains than Virgin's

Very true, and it's relative. I go up to Shropshire lots and travel on Chiltern so use nice refurb'ed Chiltern Trains and brand new ATW and London Midland stock.

I'd say the only 'big' open access operator is First Hull Trains. Grand Central and W&amp;S were just bought out by the big companies.

&gt;One of W&amp;S's problems was the upgrade work. Some of their journeys on a weekend were just ridiculous. My partner got on one from Paddington and it went past Wembley at least 3 times. 

A number of people I spoke to liked the idea of a forty quid ticket to London. They were put off by the three and a half hour journey time and the fact some weekends it wasn't running to Marylebone or whatever.

&gt;The Olympics will have been a factor, I can't imagine Silverlink doing a service for that!

From what I've heard about Silverlink I cringe at the idea of them running services during the Olympics.

&gt;Very true, and it's relative. I go up to Shropshire lots and travel on Chiltern so use nice refurb'ed Chiltern Trains and brand new ATW and London Midland stock.

Most of the older ATW stuff has been refurbished too. The 158's they use to Birmingham feel like a new train after the work they've had done, new coat of paint and a full interior refit.

&gt;The Pendolinos to me just seem a bit dated now and a bit small.... although they've never been as roomy as other trains.

I think it's to do with our smaller loading gauge.

http://www.wrexham.com/columnists/opinion-branson-remember-wrexham-shropshire-bemoans-west-coast-mainline-loss-11110.html
&gt;A year after Wrexham and Shropshire started to run the route, Virgin Trains started to run more direct and faster trains to London from Wrexham. This was considered by many including the Guardian newspaper as Virgin operating a ‘spoiler route’ to try and drive a rival out of business. Wrexham and Shropshire was also hampered by being forced by Virgins monopoly rights to use secondary lines.
&gt;
This was a contest of ‘David and Goliath’ proportions but this time Goliath fought dirty and won. So Richard Branson can throw a tantrum about the unfairness of losing his franchise to a dubious bid but many people in Wrexham will not feel too badly for him.

Some analysts have said more like 10-1 in Pakistan, further proving my point about just how out-of-touch the public's perception is. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_attacks_in_Pakistan

&gt; &gt; Reports of the number of militants versus civilian casualties differ.[12] In a 2009 opinion article, Daniel L. Byman of the Brookings Institution wrote that drone strikes may have killed ""10 or so civilians"" for every ""mid- and high-ranking [al Qaeda and Taliban] leader.""[13] In contrast, the New America Foundation has estimated that 80 percent of those killed in the attacks were militants.[14] The Pakistani military has stated that most of those killed were hardcore Al-Qaeda and Taliban militants.[15] The CIA believes that the strikes conducted since May 2010 have killed over 600 militants and have not caused any civilian fatalities

Including ""adult males"" as ""insurgents"" has a huge impact on the figures, hence the significant difference between official and non-official figures. As I said, many attacks are seen as ""100% good kills"" until family members complained loudly enough. It's not in the allies interests to properly investigate each strike as they have nothing to gain from it.

Each experience is moderated and curated to ensure you're not wasting your money, this also coincides with a solid payment system. We're using a secure chained payment system: Guest pays host &gt; money is kept within Paypal until we release it (At least 48 hours after each experience, as long as there's no complaints). This minimises the risk of scams or simply unsatisfactory experiences.

We're testing the waters with the new idea of an Experience Marketplace, so with incoming listings such as 'Stress Free at work' and 'Tarot reading' - although seemingly generic, are in fact from incredibly reputable sources (if that's your forte). 'How to be Stress Free at work' is ran by the former FuelForce MD (annual turnovers of 700M) but to name one of many amazing positions on his resume. Even the Tarot reading is hosted by a self-proclaimed 'White Witch'. 

As a growing UK startup, time is a valuable asset to us. We're a peer-to-peer marketplace, so experiences are listed by the public, this leaves the spelling and grammar up to themselves to ensure they are advertising to the best of their abilities. Such as Gumtree, we will not be moderating experiences to this level.

Traffic has shown steady growth over the past few months, with a rapid spike from recent press coverage (The Guardian, BBC Radio 4, Daily Mail). Hopefully, we'll see that spike level out with some fantastic exponential growth.

Are you:

* wanting to make a difference to anyone e.g. like a doctor/nurse

* wanting to make a difference with the disadvantaged e.g. working with homeless or mentally ill

* wanting to make a difference with people abroad e.g. working in Africa


Is you desire to make a difference also linked to making no money or are you trying to find something which is a career but also makes a difference?

Why do you want to make a difference? Is it because you think it will place lower expectations of success on you and you're not sure you want to join the rather aggressive job market?

Do you want to do this long term?

Do you know any teachers? My mother, both aunts, wife and two uni friends are all teachers. I know three people who dropped out during their PGCE when they found out what it's really like.

I guess this is probably a pipe-dream, I might just be better working and helping out in my spare time.

I want to do it primarily because I believe in social equality. I also like a challenge, but I would neither like nor succeed in what I perceive (probably wrongly) to be the cut-throat nature of business etc.

So long as I felt like I was doing something worthwhile and interesting then I don't see why I wouldn't want to do it long-term.

true,lydocia,tardis,TARDIS,"Imagine, you're an immortal, endlessly regenerating alien and you fall in love with an Earthling whom you think is the love of your life. You *want* to be with her, but you don't  think it's a good idea because you can't give up your ""job"" travelling through time and space, saving the precious Earth on a day to day basis. And she? Oh, all she wants to hear are those three wooing words, ""I love you"" - but you can't give her that.

You screw up. You accidentally lock out that love of your life into an alternative universe. You're heartbroken, but the only way to move on is by *moving on*. You get another woman to accompany you, and head off to save the planet once again.

Your lady, trapped inside another universe, fights her way out. She finds a way and comes back for you. But something goes wrong - that new companion of yours accidentally gets you cloned. There are now two of you: the real you-you, and a very human, very non-regenerating normal copy of you. 

Once more, you decide it's no use fighting for that impossible relationship, so you let her go off once again, into that alternative universe. This time, she drags along your clone. He can say it, though. He says it - I love you. You can't, you still can't. And this time, she chooses him. She'll miss you, but she can work it out with the mortal version of you, the version that is willing to make her happy.

Essentially, the love of your life has taken off with another man who very closely resembles but isn't quite you. He's the better, more perfect version of you. She has replaced you, even though you love her dearly and she you.

And yet, you continue on. Save the world, meet new people, regenerate, rinse, and repeat. Is that closure? Or is that suppressing the pain and trying to make the best of it?",0,1346082765,null,0,false,0,c5zh6eo,t3_ywilt,t1_c5zh6eo,t1_c5zh1vo,null,1429748270,90,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,90

I've done the test a few times before and I always appear buried in the bottom left corner; at the same time I know that if the test were to actually ask some specific economic questions it would push me  over to the centre of the x-axis.  If it asked me some more questions, I know it would put closer to the origin.

As an experiment I answered the questions honestly as possible and without hyperbole, as if I were defending a Conservative platform.  Answering not according to my own preferences but based on policies made and supported over the last few years.  It still appeared borderline 3rd quadrant over the origin.

Take this test and it's very difficult to not appear somewhere in the 3rd quadrant, the bottom left box, showing libertarian and leftist traits, even if you're rationally trying to second guess a platform you know to be slightly authoritarian and right of centre.

There is room for speculation as to whether this is deliberate or not, which is discussed on the debate/edit wikipage.  Political Compass is said to be owned by Pace News, and there is a distinctly environmental leftish feel archived PoliticalCompass blog that seems geared towards the American market.

I prefer the PoliticalCompass chart to the Nolan and Pournelle charts but I think somebody objective should update it and fashion it to a more UK crowd; perhaps somebody here.

true,l80,null,null,"I think his relationship with River was easier *because* of the nature of it (their timelines). River already had that level of comfort with him. There was this inevitability to it, so he couldn't over think it or really say, ""you know what, I'm not ready for this."" She never rushed him, and their relationship was always a bit fun. She irritated him at first, but he still knew that at some point he loved her (The library episode), and leaving her still hurt, even though he was just meeting her for the first time. 

Likewise, Tenant Doctor knew that he had time before he would become involved with her. He had a certain amount of time to get his affairs in order. That's why his regeneration hurt so much, too, because he wasn't ready. The irony of a timelord not having enough time.

If you watch through again, it's a lot less jarring. He flirts with Amy a lot, but really sees her as her own person, not a rebound or surrogate for Rose. He makes sure not to repeat the same mistake by excluding her boyfriend (like he did with Rose). You can see his discomfort with Amy's advances or flirting after a period of time. River is *safe*, though. She's never a companion. She comes in and out of his life at random times, and he gets to save her when she calls him. Their relationship is in many ways (I almost hate to say it) a rebound. He loves her because of what she is and represents, but probably not because of who she actually is beyond the fun and adventure of it. It's exciting and fast and unpredictable and no commitment. All he has to do is show up occasionally. 

And maybe, over time, that fling-love will evolve into something bigger and more important. But even if it doesn't, that doesn't mean it isn't love, or that it doesn't matter. It matters to both of them a great deal. 

One of the things I really like about the writing of the show is the subtlety of it. There's a lot of stuff that isn't spelled out. It's all between the lines. You have this doctor who is ancient, who is so *alone*. So very, very alone, even when he isn't. Somehow, despite all of that, he finds people who care about him, who care about him back. 

I think the most powerful scene was the christmas special where Amy and Rory ask him in for dinner, telling him they always put out a place for him just in case. He doesn't know what to do with that. It breaks through his irreverent mask that he uses to shield himself from all of the things that cause him pain. Sometimes it just hurts *too* much. He's very cyclical in how he responds to people. He loves them, loves too deeply, inevitably winds up grieving, and withdraws.

Also the house parties being shutdown by the police is sometimes ridiculous, i've been at partys that i would consider dull beyond on belief (my parents put on louder partys) that have been shut down by the police, i thinks its just because the locals hate student partys. Also on that subject last year the locals had a ""secret meeting"" with the council to discuss student residence's in Winton/Charminster, the reason is was ""secret"" was to stop the student union attending to argue their case because the local were afraid of ""retaliation"" from a bunch of well educated middle class students, i find that ridiculous.

I also have loved the show as long as I can remember it, and unlike you, I still love it.  I am pretty sure it is on an all time high in the last couple of years, especially in terms of intelligence and humour.

You don't seem to enjoy anything about the show now.  Pardon me for asking, but *so what?*

FYI The joke was that the Doctor was loving laying down the backing track, but was so stupidly out of touch and bad at it like a Dad would be, and that he didn't care anyway.  That was it.  The same joke as his embarrassing wedding dancing.  Laugh at the Doctor, next scene.  Whatever else you read into it is your own problem.  The main thing is that it was over in about three seconds, so even if your sense of humour was somehow too sophisticated for it, it shouldn't exactly be something you'd worry about.  Summoning up so much disdain about it that you'd copy and paste the same moan into multiple threads is just beyond ridiculous.

Or hey, maybe I'm off base here - feel free to pop up on every thread on a **fan** forum saying how much you hate every trivial thing about a programme that nobody is forcing you to watch.

&gt;*Imagine, you're an immortal, endlessly regenerating alien and you fall in love with an Earthling whom you think is the love of your life. You want to be with her, but you don't think it's a good idea because you can't give up your ""job"" travelling through time and space, saving the precious Earth on a day to day basis. And she? Oh, all she wants to hear are those three wooing words, ""I love you"" - but you can't give her that*.

He isn't immortal or endlessly regenerating. He can live and die, if he so chooses, like anyone else. He doesn't have endless regeneration, it was stated he has 13. As to the ""saving the world thing. It was always completely possible. He could have taken Rose and, if he wanted to, Jackie, and taken them back 40 years or so. Live their lives. Watch them grow old and and die. But live with them, as a normal person could. He could take them on his journeys. 

But the point is, like the angels do, he could take them back and live till they die. Sounds morbid, but it's actually quite a gesture of caring. He's saying it's worth it for him to stop his traveling and live out a portion of his life dedicated to them.

&gt;*Essentially, the love of your life has taken off with another man who very closely resembles but isn't quite you. He's the better, more perfect version of you. She has replaced you, even though you love her dearly and she you.*

The point is, none of that was necessary, he could have taken them out of time, and lived with them for 100 years and had a grand time. Then when they die, return and plop down 2 seconds from when they left. Ready to save the world, having gotten closure. He wasn't the perfect version of himself, he was imperfect, and the doctor said it himself. ""He is me before I got better, you changed me rose"" Or something along those lines. 

To wrap this up, the doctor could have had a perfect life with rose while still doing the ""save the world"" spiel. Just the fact that it would require the traveling to end.

Pretty much every single First train to Edinburgh that I've caught in the past year has been so crowded that people are forced to stand. If you get a seat, it's not enjoyable. It's a form of transport to get you from A to B and nothing else.

With Virgin trains though it's an enjoyable experience that I actively look forwards to. Maybe it's down to the nicer decor and lighting, the larger seats / toilets / carriages (I've never shared seats with anyone and I never advance book) and the chance to stretch my legs when going to the onboard show (which First will do away with), but I really couldn't say.

Punctuality has never been an issue for me - I can't remember a train by either being delayed by more than 10 minutes in at least 5 years. 

Summing up, I think that Virgin actively care about the experience (after all, they've got to protect their brand - don't enjoy the train and you probably won't be in a rush to sign up to their gym or broadband) whereas to First it's simply a service they're running to make as much cash as possible.

Easiest place to lie is about work experience. You should be able to remember a chain shop or supermarket that's closed since you were 16, put them as your work experience and a two-four week timeframe of work.


Now you have an employment with a date you can shoehorn in a fake summer job with manual labour so no expectation of tax forms. "" You helped JOHN SMITH with his landscaping business, contact details -&gt; PAYG burner with a ""Hello this is JOHN SMITH"" voicemail. If they're persistent with their ringing get a friend to answer and blag that they don't do landscaping anymore but you're a great guy.


Also you can say you have worked for yourself fixing computers over the summer. If you've ever done a repair for a friend of the family, you could use them as a reference if you're comfortable and they'll stretch the truth.


Grades you want to put english literature, english language and maths at the top of the list with CCC, or CDC. The rest can be a mix of Cs and Ds. 


This has worked for a couple of friends and I when we had nothing to put on our CVs. It isn't even that bad for nerves because the lies aren't huge but they're enough to get you in the door and show you have some basic work history.


Also as people say volunteering for a charity for a short while will get you a legit reference, and that leads to the rest of the cv being a lot more believable. 


Just send it to a handful at first till you're ok with the idea and don't worry that you're white lying. At the end of the day people lie for bigger things, a couple of little lies so your cv doesn't get chucked out of a pile isn't the end of the world.

Unlike the US, the UK doesn't tax citizens if they are legaly domiciled abroad (just ask a tax exile) so you may be able to live the dream!

The only complication being the time you will spend in this country (the other 3 months of the year?) may be enough to bar you from claiming domicile. I *think* they allow 90 days, but it might have changed

[Worth checking here....](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/international/domicile.htm)

Also, you'll need some paperwork and officialy register in your new country; it's probably worth paying for some help from a relocation service if none is available.
And you'll need to inform HMRC if you've been registering self assessment before. The fact that you've suddenly stopped paying tax won't go unnoticed! 

Good luck dude

But I think the likes of certain parts of the East End, and the north bring the average way down. Averages are useless for this kind of thing and it is well known that there is huge inequality between Bearsden and Possilpark or Calton for example. I know other cities have good and bad areas.

Her last was when they first kissed, from his perspective.

One day we all went to a local state park and hung out on the beach.  The park ranger came around and hassled us, I can't remember why.  My family was lined up behind him and I was talking to him rather loudly, I was mad at him for some reason.  Somewhere in there, I called him a smeghead.  It just slipped out because we used it all the time.  Luckily, that guy had never heard it before and he didn't see the expressions on the faces of the rest of the family.  He stopped me mid-sentence to ask me about it.  I told him it was a nonsense word that we used sometimes, it didn't mean anything.  I wasn't really lying, it really didn't mean much to us.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Two reasons:

Doctor Who stopped being children's programming a *long* time ago. A show that handles death, genocide, and complex issues of philosophy, fear, and loss has stepped so far from being purely for children that the BBC no longer rates it as a children's show (it is now a ""family programme"").

Secondly the thing is that people *do die*. They die all the time. The fact that the Doctor and his companions are constantly immune is becoming less and less believable.

It's difficult to have episodes where the Doctor laments the fact that his relationship with his companions is likely to end with him standing above their broken bodies when this is contrasted by the fact that no major recurring character has actually met with a permanent death.

Doctor Who is a show that has been *notorious* as of late for ""take backs"". Hell, in a show where the main character can have ""I AM GOING TO DIE!"" be the main focus of *three* finales in a row and then consistently *not die* the idea of someone *actually dying* is a massive move toward commitment.

Doctor Who took off the kit gloves a while ago when they decided to display murder in virtually *every bloody episode*. It's *not* a kid's show anymore, and if it decides to kill off a companion it can do that because *it's a show where some people die*.",0,1346114471,null,0,false,0,c5zpixj,t3_yxj72,t1_c5zpixj,t3_yxj72,null,1429752271,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Its citizens have a longer life expectancy and lower infant mortality, and the country has more acute-care hospital beds per capita and fewer deaths related to surgical or medical mishaps. Britain achieves these results while spending proportionally less on health care than the U.S. — about $2,500 per person in Britain, compared with $6,000 in the U.S. For these reasons, the World Health Organization (WHO) ranked Britain 18th in a global league table of health-care systems (the U.S. was ranked 37th). However, there are measures by which the U.S. outperforms Britain: for instance, the U.S. has lower cancer mortality rates.

But when I got the Tom Baker version, it was pretty clunky, noticeably thicker than the screen-used version; the Pertwee model looked like it would be the same proportions. And I couldn't find any McGann versions (at least for a reasonable price).

So I modelled them in Blender and had them 3D-printed, then painted them up and assembled them. Turned out pretty well, I think; a friend suggested I post them here.

So, here they are; the top three are the ones I made. I left a space at the bottom for the next screen-used version, so I don't have to entirely redo it (and until then I've filled the slot with one of the ""build your own"" models). Since there was a lot of space off to the left and right, I also added the Master's pocket watch and the Pertwee-era TARDIS key.

Just because the 50th 'may be about the Doctor(s) doesn't mean that companions won't be featured/can't come back; take [The Five Doctors](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Five_Doctors_(TV_story)) for example, sure it's about the Doctors, but their companions are also present. As I said before, the companions help shape the Doctor into who he is and thus are as nearly important to the story as the Doctor is himself. 

As I was implying before, unless you've actually seen the story for the 50th and the Ponds, you can't be certain that there won't be twists and turns that Moffat likes so much. It's a sad existence if one presumes to know everything and act so closed minded.

That's all well and good, but you have to remember the writers are human too. Was it not stated in Blink that Weeping Angels turn to stone when being observed, a fact of their biology? Yet in the Byzantium story, as Amy has her eyes closed 'only pretending' to see the Angels are still stone, and then they move while they're stone instead of 'turning to stone'. Just because you think it would be inconsistent doesn't mean the writers don't make mistakes. Besides being a paradox doesn't mean it can't be written into the story or shown on tv. Take 'Father's Day', [spoiler](#s ""the whole episode was about a paradox yet Rose's dad came back for that episode""). Or a more recent episode, 'The Wedding of River Song', [spoiler](#s ""arguably a paradox since the Doctor's death was a fixed point, yet we have a whole alternate universe where time is dying because River didn't kill him"").  Where I'm going with this is, even if Amy and Rory are sent back and 'die', they can still be brought back for the 50th story. I'm not saying they'll be back permanently, but they can still be 'guest stars'. 'Time isn't a straight progression of cause to effect'.

Also, as a side note, notice that in virtually every instance that someone is TRULY hinting that the Doctor's name has some cosmic importance outside of him (Shakespeare's question, for example, could be purely based in personal psychology) was either written directly by or approved by Moffat.  

I think this is one of Moffat's pet things and I REALLY hope he doesn't go too far with it.

About the only way I could see them going down this road and having it pay off without being stupid is if, basically, the question of the Doctor's name is a *deliberate* red herring he's set up to throw his enemies off.

My daughter works as a senior Radiographer and is also on call as a cardio cath radiographer.  It is perfectly normal for her to work a full day, 8 till 5, and then be on call all night for cardio cath to a hospital an hour away.  She will be expected to work the next day.  And due to shenanigans with shifts, overtime and changes to shift policies etc. she now earns less than she did when she left med school.  

Sometimes she has to work all weekend 8 weekends in a row.  She's only 26.  What sort of life is that?  I wish she chosen a bog standard job.  She'd be no worse off, she'd be more valued by her employers, her young life wouldn't be passing her by, she wouldn't have to x ray legs delivered in a bucket from an RTA to see if they are viable, she wouldn't have ignorant English chavs threatening to get her suspended (and they probably would if they could summon the energy, because they CAN treat the staff like crap and they know it) just because she addressed the wrong person in the waiting room, she wouldn't have to see 150% of the patients in a day she used to (and when, inevitably, there's a mistake - career over?), she wouldn't have to endure colleagues who are allowed to get away with working only 2 days out of 4 months and endlessly cover for them because they are ""stressed"", she wouldn't be forced to work Christmas Day when she had booked it specially a year before because her brother was coming home for Christmas (yet others who booked just weeks before were not asked because in the NHS it's all about who is ""in with"" the one who does the staff rota).  

So yeah the NHS is great in a lot of ways for a lot of people.  But there are dedicated professionals all over the UK, giving way more than they should for less reward, being drained by the increasing demands placed upon them and they are increasingly at risk from the fallout of mistakes that are inevitable with the pressure they are under and it saddens me to see my daughter become increasingly disillusioned with something she had so much belief in when she started work.  

Nobody in this thread is being honest enough to say that it's dying before our eyes.  It is being systematically dismantled, sold off, privatised and more or less destroyed.

Sidenote: Making the Angels turn to/move as stone is really inconsistent. It implies that they have some level of control whether they're stone or not instead of they HAVE to be stone when observed. If this is the case, since they're 'as old as the universe', why have they not been able to evolve past that obvious hindrance when hunting. 

Ah, it's my fault for not specifying. The single quote marks on 'research' meant any type of observation/connection making relating loosely to research.

Okay, I hope you realize that your reasoning is slightly hypocritical. You're refusing to accept the POSSIBILITY that they could come back because you want that fan-fic theory to be true. But what I was trying to say was that they can come back for a brief period which the 50th may address. I did not mean they come back to the current time line forever. The best way I can try to describe this concept is like this: Angel's send Amy/Rory back, wibbly wobbly stuff happens, Doctor ends up in the same time period they were sent, they have an episode long adventure (with others), he leaves them there. Basically it's like you're working, take a quick bathroom break and after, you come back and finish your work. But in this case, that 2 min bathroom break is a 50th anni episode long special.

The actual death itself is not exactly easy to write. You have to create a death that is both very final, poetic to that character's journey, and thematically complimentary to the journey of a show as a whole. It's not like you can have Rory thunked by a city bus and be done with it, it requires a lot of talent to write a character death successfully.

Secondly a character *death* is far more difficult to write long term than simply removing the character non-lethally. If they get put on a bus you can have a moment or so of mourning and then move on. Had Rose known that Jack had died or had Donna been killed instead of having her memory wiped following stories would have played out very differently because a death weighs far more on characters than a goodbye.

The lazy thing to do would be to cop out of death. To get a nice workaround where we can say goodbye to the Ponds without it being totally final, never having to commit to anything or make a bold decision.

A death can be done poorly, it can be written badly, it can be shoehorned and not fit and just be a rage-inducing mar on the series. But please, it's not *lazy* to handle a character death.

Logically it makes sense to offload an expensive player who is going to ride your bench because they lack the movement and pace and aren't best suited to play your style of football. Not only would this allow you to bring in players that better fit the system you are trying to build, but this expensive player will no longer be rotting on your bench and losing value. 

I really like Carroll...... I wanted him to be successful at Liverpool and show all the doubters wrong. Unfortunately for Carroll the system we are building does not suit his attributes and it would be better for both parties if he were sold. Watch Suarez and Borini's movement off the ball and compare it with Carroll. Carroll is often standing and waiting behind a defender on the back post or outside the box. He isn't running behind defenses, filling  gaps, creating space, cutting off passing lanes or pressing defenders all over the pitch. These things are all necessary if Rodger's system is going to be **as effective as possible.** 

**TLDR:** Logically Andy Carroll is a good footballer and he can ""work"" in any system, but for Carroll to be his best and Rodgers' system to be the most effective it is best if the player is moved on into a system that fits his strengths and Liverpool brings in new players that better fit theirs.

Most would say start with 2005, (season 1 of the Doctor Who revival) and that's perfectly fine, it's written in a way that you don't need to know much at all about the history of the show. If you do start here, do so knowing that the effects and costumes and production value get exponentially better. The episodes get tighter and even more clever.

Its for this reason that some might recommend the second way of starting which is to start with season 5, the beginning of the story for the most recent incarnation of the doctor. Once again, this point in the series is designed to be another jumping in point for new fans. The first four season built upon each other, this is a fresh start. This is where i started watching them as they came out a couple years ago and going back to the older series when i got netflix recently. the idea this way is to go season 5 to 6, then go back to season 1 and fill in the gap.

His name is Travis English, and he's probably one of the coolest guys I know. He sends me every single Doctor Who poster he makes, knowing I'm a huge fan, and actually has told me, he doesn't post them without my approval ;). Not sure how true that is, but whatever. I'm the one who convinced him to start watching Doctor Who, so in a way, I feel responsible for all the good DW posters he makes :P Buy lots of things so he can give me a cool wedding present. Also, he has iphone cases and such for purchase as well, not just prints. It's pretty tight.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Wow - I LOVE the versatility in all of these players (minus Lloris, but that goes without saying). 

Dzagoev can play striker or attacking midfielder. Willian can play well on both wings and the middle. Dembele can play as a striker or as a CM. M'Vila can play as a defensive midfielder or as a CM. 

If we have a starting XI on the field in a formation like this:

Bale - Ade - Willian
Dzagoev - Dembele - M'Vila
BAE - Vert - Kaboul - Walker

To make this a more defense minded formation that can still rain in the goals you can make one swap, Ade for Sandro, and run a 4-2-3-1 that looks like this: 

Dzagoev
Willian - Dembele - Bale
M'Vila - Sandro
BAE - Vert - Kaboul - Walker

Swapping one player can change our entire teams tactics. We can really strengthen the defensive ability of the team but still force our opponent to have to keep players on defense so as not to eat goals from the our two wingers and Dzagoev. The shots and pace on the front four in this scenario would allow us a HELL of a counter attacking team, too. 

I love utility players, as you can see! Having a few utility players that can play in a few different positions means you can switch up tactics on the fly if something isn't working (something Mourinho is very successful at) and switch up tactics between matches. 

This was our biggest issue the last few seasons - predictability. Remove that from the equation and we'll be a very, very hard opponent for any club! ",0,1346130185,null,0,false,0,c5ztfcw,t3_yy0c3,t1_c5ztfcw,t3_yy0c3,null,1429754122,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Donna's character was a semi-good one; an unlucky poor woman, quite clumsy, who just happens to exist around a rift in time and space, dragging the Doctor to her over and over again. She grows useful and eventually, absorbs the Doctor-energy so she becomes the Doctordonna, but not being able to bear it with her human body, she loses her memory and goes back to her poor life, without even remembering. (Afterwards, the Doctor slips her a winning lottery ticket, and there's Wilf, yada yada yada). Technically, a strong character.

Then there is Catherine Tate. Oh, I *love* Catherine Tate. Lauren Cooper is fantastic. Tate tops my list of favourite comediennes, and fuck it, she even called her kid Erin which is a wonderful name. She's done some great work, I love her (albeit irritating yet funny) voice, yeah. She seems to be a bit daft at times, but it's cute and funny, I can appreciate it.

But god damn it, who thought of combining the two?

There's this great chemistry between Tennant and Tate (that sounds like a lawyer firm) that I can truly feel through Doctor Who, but not as much as I feel it in all of the other works they've done together. Their relationship is great, both on and off screen. But still... other than that, I didn't think Tate was a fit choice for the role of Donna. Donna needed to be more clumsy, to be cuter, to be quieter even?

He has had access to free medication, the best doctors in the world (European and American consults paid for by the NHS) home respite for my brother, residential respite, support for all the extended family and an especially adapted house so he could live my brother for longer (paid for by the council but pushed for by the NHS doctors because staying at home was best for him). The doctors and nurses went to court off of their backs to support my brothers custody bid and he has spent so much time in the local childrens hospital that they keep a bed by the nurses station as empty as possible (high turn over) in case he has to go in.

2) Yes. Each season get progressively better effects and budget. When you get to Season 5, the budget goes through the roof.

PS- Don't forget to watch the specials after season 4 in this order, as they are important: The Next Doctor, Planet of the Dead, Waters of Mars, End of Time 1&amp;2 ... then go on to season 5.

If by a bit of tax you mean keeping up your NI contributions, then yes (but you could do that and not remain a resident). In terms of income tax you are liable to pay full tax in the UK if you remain resident.  Qzapwy has done a much better job than I did outlining the potential complications.

In short, it's probably worth getting some professional advice and paying for an accountant that specializes in international tax to file your returns whilst you are abroad. That could well work out cheaper and give you peace of mind compared to muddling through and facing a large tax bills with heavy penalties at some point in the furure.

It is one of the best things we have - to be honest I think accessibility to healthcare is a human right and thus shouldn't be allowed to be bought or sold - the sole determinant should be medical need. Just as we accept that liberty is a human right and therefore do not allow people to sell themselves into slavery or deal in the same.

I don't go to the doctor unless I think it is quite serious - I should probably go more often, but obviously I don't like to spend the time there when I can be doing something else, and obviously going for every little thing is just a waste of resources.

I am currently living in Germany for the summer, where although there is insurance, you still see the cost as it were (although practically you don't - it's not like the USA) and it still feels really wrong to me. I just prefer the NHS where money doesn't even come into it at all - it takes away one concern which you really don't need when you are ill.

Most of what you have listed is known as Classic Doctor Who which ran from 1963-1987. Most people initially skip classic Who and go back if they are really really into the series since it can be hard to watch being so old. Here is a good watching order for current series.

* Season 1 (2005)
* Season 2 
* Torchwood Season 1 (Doctor Who spinoff)
* Season 3
* Torchwood Season 2
* Season 4
* The Specials(Season 4.5 as I call it): (in this order)
                              
            - The Next Doctor
            - Planet of the Dead
            - The Waters of Mars
            - The End of Time Part1 and 2

Although it always amazes me given the absolute dearth of academic positions that people still pursue a career in it. I know one person who was forced to leave Physics after having worked in their field for 7 years due to not being able to secure another post-doc (as I said, long-term academic positions as opposed to relatively poorly paid, insecure 3-year contract post-doc positions are incredibly rare) and I know another person who is nearly 40 and still waiting for an academic position.

It's just crazy - it is one of the most important roles we have and yet the conditions are pretty awful. You see the CBI bitching and moaning about a STEM shortage but in actual fact if anything we have too many students and not enough high-tech jobs - the CBI of course have a vested interest in creating such a glut so they can pay peanuts.

You see comments from professors asking why so few STEM PhD students are from the UK as opposed to abroad but to me that just seems like asking why so few textile workers are from the UK as opposed to abroad, UK students can see the poor prospects and choose to go elsewhere like finance or IT.

Myself, I am just finishing a Master's in Physics and have to decide whether to continue to do a PhD so I get to do some real novel research or whether to pursue a career in programming etc. instead where I can actually expect decent prospects.

What's worse is that the students themselves often don't even complain as there is a toxic atmosphere where if you aren't willing to accept the worst possible conditions then you simply don't 'love science' enough and are a mercenary sell-out. With the position as it stands I am almost certain that the very best students often opt for the highly rewarding and competitive financial industries rather than research.

true,ihatephilosophy,lfc99,,"Hate to be a nitpicker but that isn't exactly how logic works...

Here would be a bit of a way we can logically look at it:

1. Andy Carroll's biggest strength is his aerial ability (heading ability).
2. Liverpool is playing a possession based attack.
3. If Andy Carroll's biggest strength is in heading the ball, he needs balls crossed into him.
4. Many crossed balls result in loss of possession.
5. If he needs balls cross into him, many of those crossed balls will result in a loss of possession.
6. If Andy Carroll's biggest strength is in heading the ball, many of those crossed balls (attempts to get him the ball) will result in a loss of possession.
.: Therefore  LFC can use Andy Carroll's biggest strength or not play possession style attack.

The wording is a little funky because I was simplifying it for sentential logic reasons. But essentially if we want to play a possession style attack, we have to give up Carroll's biggest strength. We would then be left with Carroll attempting to play more of a Suarez of Borini style that, let's face it, he really isn't good at and there is no reason believe he will suddenly be good at it.

And the thing about logic is that logic is just a way at reaching a conclusion. You can use a sound argument, like mine, and theoretically reach the same conclusion as if you conducted a study, analyzed the numbers, and corrected for deviations. In both cases, logic is at work. If you would actually conduct a study, you risk wasting time and losing matches. 

So please, if you have a logical reason for why you think Carroll would actually work, I'd love to hear it. Sell me on him. I like him and want him to fit in. But as it stands, what proof do you have that Carroll would work in this system?",0,1346143895,null,0,false,0,c5zvj2o,t3_ywmyh,t1_c5zvj2o,t1_c5zmzd3,null,1429755100,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,square13,null,null,"The NHS is great, but it's not without its fault.

The world health organisation ranks the UKs healthcare 18th in the world, which is not bad given it is free for everyone in the country.

However like a lot of people will say, it is a bit of a behemoth and full of self-serving bureaucrats. The NHS provides free healthcare for a pretty small population of people (60 million) but it is the third largest employer in the world yet we never seem to have enough nurses or doctors.

If you have an emergency health issue, like a stroke or a heart attack then the NHS is brilliant and you will get sorted straight away, if you are  however needing a hip replacement or something deemed not to be urgent you might have to wait 6-7 months before you can get the operation, probably in quite a lot of pain in the meantime. 

Also, as stupid as Sarah Palin's 'death panels' comment was - how often do you see people raising money for their kids so they can go get and get cutting edge treatment in the USA? The treatment is not available on the NHS, ultimately that is the government/doctors dictating who and who cant recieve treatment. A law was only just recently passed which now made it illegal for doctors to refuse treatment to patients based purely on their age (ie, 'sorry we can't give you this surgery you are too old' should not be happening anymore).

The NHS isn't perfect so it should be open to reform, I have no idea what kind of reform is needed but we should stop treating it like some kind of sacred cow. The budget has been increased steadily over the last 10 years and there has been no increase in standards. Let's not forget we have an aging population - the diabetes that is going to hit the baby boomer generation is expected to take up 20% of the current budget alone. The problem is just about no politician can suggest any kind of major NHS reform without committing political suicide, the others jump on the bandwagon and start screaming 'privitisation' and make it out we going to turn into the USA overnight and it becomes a political football when people's lives are on the line. Really makes me pretty sick.",0,1346148109,null,0,1346148737,0,c5zvxfm,t3_yxcjq,t1_c5zvxfm,t3_yxcjq,null,1429755289,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5
true,34Mbit,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"There is no 'tax' for the NHS directly. It used to be (for a very short time) that National Insurance Contributions would pay for your state pension, out-of-work benefits, and the NHS. NIC's have basically merged with regular income tax, but remain terribly regressive, and a PITA to calculate (especially the self-employed).

The NHS is though, just as its old funding namesake suggests, a form of insurance. There are two ways to cover the costs of medical care; individual insurance or national insurance. With individual insurance, you pay premiums based on your assessed risk at the time of the policy start date. Risk in this sense is the likelihood you'll require funding in the future for treatment. With national insurance, huge actuary tables and other large statistical databases predict the expense of an entire population, and thus calculate premiums accordingly.

For example, a private policy would be interested in 'how likely are *you* to develop a cancer?', whereas a national insurance policy would ask 'how many people are likely to develop cancer'.

Obviously, a private policy wouldn't be able to cover your costs for say, cancer, if you were diagnosed after only premiums for a year. To create a 'float' of cash to pay for treatment, you are grouped with other members of a similar risk assessment. Young healthy single men are in one pool, old frail women are in another; both pay different premium rates. It is in the best interests of the insurer to have as many small pools as possible, as it allows them to remain competitive and offer the cheapest premiums to as many people as possible. A young single man wouldn't want to be put into a risk-pool with an old woman, who is likely to need as many hip replacements as hot dinners.

Compare that to how a national insurance policy operates. **Everyone** is put in the same, flat pool. Your individual risk is never really calculated, only that of the entire population. It is known that 1% of babies will be born disabled, 5% will have this-or-that, etc., and the entire budget is summed as the bottom line £150 billion (or whatever it is these days). Everyone pays the same amount, men and women, old and young, born disabled and athletes. This is a crap deal for the young and fit, and an awesome deal for the old and frail. This kind of long-term cradle-to-grave assessment prevents 'tragedy of the commons' scenarios from occurring. The two examples I use are vaccines and birth control.

Take birth control to be a medical treatment that is taken by the majority of a subset of the population, for a very long time. As I said earlier, men are grouped with men, women with women, so no man would ever join a policy that paid for women's BC, because there will be another insurer down the road who will exclude that line for a cheaper premium. The only people who will use BC are women, and so women, being grouped together in their risk pool, will bare the entire burden of the cost. Individually, this would add to their premiums; 

    (pool members * BC cost + overheads) / (pool members)

Basically, it becomes cheaper for women to pay for their long-term treatments (BC) out-of-pocket rather than rely on insurance. Compare this to a national insurance, where the risk and cost is spread across everyone (and thus the social benefits, too).

As for vaccines, why would an insurer pay to vaccinate a member who could just up and leave for a cheaper insurer that doesn't vaccinate once he has received his perk? The answer is length of membership, and as i've explained, national insurance schemes have the longest membership possible; from the cradle to the grave.

A lot of people dislike the national insurance policies because they force you to pay extra when you're a lower risk, basically.",0,1346148133,null,0,false,0,c5zvxit,t3_yxcjq,t1_c5zvxit,t3_yxcjq,null,1429755289,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

In reality, only a couple of fairly rare genetic diseases are related to the mother's age and even the main one, Down's Syndrome, carries a below 1% probability for a women in her 40s, and genetic screening is readily available.

Smoking &amp; drinking around the time of conception &amp; pregnancy is worse for causing defects, even though many mothers do it. However, even this causes defects in only a couple of percent of pregnancies where the mother drinks/smokes. Still, genetically speaking, it would be better the mother is older and drinks/smokes less, but is unlikely to actually result in problems in the child either way.

Some answers to your thread's question:

* I have uploaded the 1976 FA cup victory to youtube and you can give it a watch here: [Link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqb5zGBYpDg). It is our sole major trophy.

* [This is hilarious](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/league-one/table).

* 2 Clubs? From outside the UK, justifiable. From the UK, much harder to justify.

* We were for a long time (26 years) a top division club until we went into administration. This culminated in losing most of our players and ending up on -10 points in tier 3 after being bought out by Markus Liebherr.

* Another club legend is [Mick Channon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Channon)

* We are responsible for fielding the [worst player to grace the Premier League](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyT1r_oVcdA)

Who? Everybody? Do you mean that I personally gave the cast of TOWIE a TV contract? I think of this as the ""journalistic we""; it enables lazy journalists to spot a small problem and then apply it to the population as a whole. I know it's just splitting hairs, but it's still annoying.

More to the point, are they really idolised? Aren't they pretty much hot for one series of the show, then found on increasingly obscure television channels over the course of the next couple of years, before fading into mediocrity soon after?

Even a ""big"" star, say, Mark Wright off of TOWIE, is well on his way out now. I think he's got a TV series based around a lads' holiday that's on ITV4, which no one will watch, and which will die a quiet death in obscurity. Even Amy Childs, the big success of the series, isn't really doing anything these days.

I just think people overstate the importance and popularity of these TV personalities. Fake-reality TV is just the fashionable thing at the moment. Give it a year or so, the bubble will burst, and we can all get on with our lives.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Moutinho - his workrate is second to none, he plays with his heart in every game I've seen him in. Any player other than Moutinho would just be settling, IMO, as he's untouchable in his workrate, his stamina is top notch, and he knows AVB and the new system well. 

Remy (if the rumor of our renewed interest is true) - he's great on the right wing, and he's a great striker. Two for one deal there. If we have Dembele and need cover for the striker position because Ade and Defoe are out (first at ACN and second injured, for example) then we're missing our CM unless we go with Kane up front. Too risky IMO, we need a dedicated CM. Remy would be able to give us backup in the striker position as well as in the wings. He's also proven in a much better league than Willian and will probably come for cheaper. 

Willian (if Remy rumors are not true) - he can play on the left, he can play on the right, he seems to have tricky footwork and he seems to do okay with physical players. I worry, though, because even though he plays in arguably a much inferior league he still doesn't really stand out that much. For example, my favorite player Vieirinha (CM or winger, very pacy, great feet, fantastic shot - used to play for PAOK) was a superstar in Greece but, upon moving to Wolfsburg, has faded into obscurity. The disparity in the leagues will be evident, I think. 

Lloris - it's not often a top-notch keeper is available, and it's even more rare that he wants to come to you for a decent price. This is one of those things you have to jump on. 

Bonus: M'Vila. He's good with short passes, can win the ball around midfield, and will really strengthen our defense when Sandro makes forward runs with the ball. I wouldn't want him in a CM position (though he can play that) but he'd be superb in a 4-2-3-1 position with Sandro as DMs. Both can play box to box, while when one moves forward, the other can drop to defend and we won't see any loss of defensive effectiveness. 

Dzagoev is a pipe dream, I think. I don't really want Damiao. I wasn't impressed by him at the Olympics; top goal scorer he may have been but he didn't stand out. He seems like the 'be in the spot enough times and you're bound to score' kind of player. I'm sure any #9 playing with Neymar behind and Hulk to his right will score plenty of goals! Dembele, while good, is not a replacement for Moutinho IMO. I haven't seen as much of him as I've seen of Moutinho, but I've kept my eye on Dembele in both matches I've seen this season and I think we should drop the extra 8m or so for Moutinho, no question.

Firstly, my girlfriend and I have a 10-week-old baby, so we've been, very recently, through an experience where we've been very close to the NHs. At most, by which I mean more than 95%, of the contacts we had with midwives, nurses, doctors and - eventually - surgeons, we were genuinely incredibly humbled by the professionalism of these people. Fantastic care, people that went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable, secure and well looked-after. I also rather liked 
the no-nonsense approach some of them offered. Take one of our (free) NCT classes, for example, in which a young Brazilian girl 
mentioned that she wanted a Caesarean birth. The midwife taking the session explained that, as far as she knew, the NHS never did elective
C-section: the decision to do surgery was only ever made on medical grounds. When our young mujer explained that many patients were 
advised to have C-section in Brazil, the midwife patiently explained that this was because non-essential surgery was a money-spinner for
the hospital. 

Secondly, at a dinner recently where I got talking to a Swiss guy who turned out to be an anaesthesiologist. He'd worked in a number of countries but for the last 8 years had been in London working for the NHS. He said that there were, obviously, problems with the
NHS system, as there were with all systems: universal or insurance-funded, private or public. But he did say that this was the only
country he'd ever been in where procedures were made solely and always on medical grounds. The obvious corollary to this is that, with
the onus being placed on doctors in general practice to make business decisions as well as clinical ones, another factor comes in to 
play that may affect the way care is doled out. But hey, I've typed enough. All I can say for sure is, if you're pregnant and live in the north /  central London area, you can do a hell of a lot worse than University College Hospital.

If you're gonna be living close to campus and enjoy walking then its probably not worth the money.

Average night out? I would say somewhere around £30-£60, including clubs (well, depends what clubs you go to). Pints will set you back anywhere from £2 up to £5 or more, again depending on where you go and what you drink. Mixed drinks are around the same range.

For me the top 3 deals i would like to see:

**Hugo Lloris** - Not often a class keeper comes available at an affordable price.  May not be our most pressing need but it would fill a long term need and give us the world class calibre keeper that all teams that want to be perrenial CL contenders need.  Lloris with BAE, Kaboul, Vertongen and Walker in front of him would give us a top notch defense that can cause fits for any team in the EPL.

**Moussa Dembele** - is he the exact fit to replace Modric?  Maybe not but he has been pure class since moving into the central mid slot for Fulham.  Creative, young and affordable would be a great fit for us going forward. Paired with VDV/Gylfi/Sandro he would give us the work rate and creativity to free up Gylfi/VDV in attack while ensuring that Sandro doesn't need to be a passer.

**Willian** - Ability to play both wings plus up the middle gives us much needed coverage while maintaining attacking threat.  Not overly happy about his price. I would prefer Dzagoev for the price we would be paying but i think we may have started thinking about him seriously a little too late.

***Bonus*** -**Yann M'Vila** and/or **Loic Remy** - M'Vila is a high value target at a low cost, Seems he has the passing ability to be a bit more than a holding mid.  I have always been partial to Remy and now that i am seeing pricing in the 12-15m range i think he would be a good fit. Pacey with more size than JD, good instincts and decent touch would be a solid fit with Ade and he can cover on the wing in a pinch.",0,1346168765,null,0,false,0,c5zzhoz,t3_yyluf,t1_c5zzhoz,t3_yyluf,null,1429757034,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

Not saying they don't have a right to keep their players, but when you fuck over your partner by handing your best player to the partner's second biggest rival and one who will be competing with a CL spot with them without letting your partner know and letting them bid a bit more then you don't really seem like a good ally. 

We also have partnerships with other clubs, like South China AA from Hong Kong, Supersport United from South Africa, and TOT S.C. from Thailand. The fuck purpose do they serve?

You just answered the question you should have asked. 

Labour threw money at the NHS after years of under-funding. How that money was spent may very well be up for debate - and, in any system of bureaucracy, allocations of funding are going to be less than perfect - but the reality is that we, like most 1st world western societies, are living longer, and this brings with all the problems you'd expect. More age-related debilitating conditions. More serious long-term illnesses, requiring expensive long-term treatment.

&gt;Under new plans 18 to 24 year-olds who have spent less than six months in employment since leaving school or college will have to work at least 30 hours a week to get their £56-a-week jobseeker’s allowance.

&gt;**They will also get a guaranteed 10 hours a week help preparing their CVs and searching for a job.**

Putting aside for one second the fact that they're effectively being paid a little less than £1.88 per hour whilst on these ""work experience"" programmes.

10 hours per week, for the duration, to prepare a CV and to get help with job search? That's around 120hrs to show someone how to type up a CV in Word / Google Docs, tailor it for specific jobs, and showing them how to use indeed.co.uk / apprenticeship websites.

If the Government really think it takes that long to teach someone those skills, then what does that say about their own faith in the education system?

**Edit:**

Still, in all honesty I'm not sure how I feel about the Doctor changing sex.
