* Pre order your tickets and collect them early if possible, as match-day collection leaves you open to last minute problems and delays.
* The Jobsite stand (affectionately dubbed the Fratton  End) is the main home stand and the preferable location for seats by a long way. This is where 90% the world famous atmosphere is generated( Including the drum and brass section). You will get a good sense of it no matter where you sit, but to really feel part of it, this is the only choice. Also, it offers the best view of the entire field, particularly the rows further back.
* I would recommend going for a drink somewhere in Fratton Road before the game. [The John Jaques](https://plus.google.com/113215163606427741664/about?hl=en) has a decent atmosphere, without too many idiots, plus only a 10-15 minute walk to the ground.
* Leave the pub about an hour before kick-off. This will give you time to walk down Goldsmith Ave, buy a match-day program, scarf and commemorative badge (pin?) from one of the street vendors, navigate to your designated entrance and find your seat. (The stewards are pretty friendly and very helpful)
* Food and beer inside is of an average at best quality, and prices are high, but not ridiculous. The facilities are grim, but redilly available should nature call. If you cant go 2 hours without a ciggerette, you can chance a cheeky smoke in a cubicle at half-time, but stewards are aware of the practice, and the shitty ones may throw you out, but the option is there.
* Certain etiquettes must be followed once on the sacred grounds. The word Southampton no longer exists, but there is a place up the road called Scum. Any former Scum player, now playing for the opposition must be booed when his name is called, when he is in possession of the ball, when he is about to take a set piece....basically whenever he draws any attention whatsoever. Other, more liberal abuse hurling is optional, though certainly not discouraged. (That said, no racism, that's not how we do things.)
* Lastly, there are always a few people that will leave early, either because we are playing badly, or they want to beat the traffic. Don't be *that* guy. It pisses off the people you have to squeeze past, and there are few more disheartening sights as a player, than your own fans abandoning hope that you will get a result from the game.

Didn't the electricity network in London collapse a few years ago because it was the height of summer and the additional load of air conditioning was too much?

The electricity network is built to allow most users to draw a modest amount of current, but that's because the National Grid is planned to military precision (if YouTube actually works for you, there's videos on it showing how they watch for TV ad breaks because that's when everyone fires up their kettles - and they have to make sure there's enough supply in place). 

Virgin like all ISPs are going to oversell because to give everyone a dedicated connection, or near enough to it, will cost far more than the £30 a month you give them.

As far as his ability to play as a deep lying playmaker, Mikel's lack of such skills has been one of his greatest knocks, at least for me.  Remember how we were desperately trying to get Luka, and then Fellaini? That was because the club agreed with me, and saw Mikel as a destroyer rather than playmaker. So they tried to add someone who would fill that gap, though they obviously failed (unless you count Oscar, but that's another discussion).

true,DoctorsGurl95,tennant,Tennant,"I agree with your hypothesis, to an extent, although I do have a little niggling issue with the conclusion. Can you *honestly* say that there hasn't been tragedy with each of his companions' endings? Yes, in a way they all had happy endings, but there was definitely a shit ton of tragedy heaped in with those happy endings. 


Take Rose, for example. With her ending, she was removed from her current timeline, plucked out of a life that she never wanted to end; she wanted to go on travelling with the Doctor for the rest of her life, and as far as she was concerned, nothing was ever going to get in the way of that. And then comes the Cybermen, and the Void, and her life as she knew it started ending from the beginning of that 2-part episode. Yes, in the end, Rose got her man, but he wasn't the same person. I was an entirely knew entity, whether they had the same memories or not. Yes, she got to live out a human life with A Doctor, but, despite what we know he whispered in her ear, which was the same thing the Doctor got cut off from saying, he was a different person, born in the thirst of blood, years later. Rose still lived for a long while without him. And that contributes to tragedy as far as I'm concerned.


Now for Donna, yes, she ended up with financial security and love, but Donna had change so much over the course of her time with the Doctor, and at the end of it all, she didn't even remember any of it. Definitely a tragic ending.


And as for Amy and Rory, well, that wound is too fresh to poke at too much, but there was tragedy mixed in with the happiness that they still got to live their lives out together. They never saw their families again, they never saw their friends again, and they never saw the Doctor again, and despite how they struggled with trying to maintain a life separate from their life with the Doctor, we all know there was a part of them that lived for the thrill of adventuring with the Doctor, and a part of them that, odds are, once they were dumped back in time, with no Doctor to be able to rescue them, missed travelling with him, missed hearing the sound of the TARDIS materializing outside, inside, or around them in their pretty little blue house. Amy lost one of her best friends, and they both lost their son-in-law. Kind of tragic, if you ask me.

I think part of it is the high numbers involved. £9k per year for tuition. Potentially graduating with £50k of debt to your name. That's quite scary, so it will reduce the number of people going to university. It was also designed to introduce competition, so that lesser universities could appeal to people by being cheaper. Whether that has worked or not remains to be seen.

However, the generous loan repayments mean that really only people whose degree benefited them actually pay for it. Otherwise it would be TOO punishing to make people who get shitty jobs repay a full loan off their low earnings.

I wonder how many of the students attending protests actually understood this. If you do engineering at imperial or medicine etc, your degree is surely worth the money and you'll pay back the loan quickly.

Anyone who remembers Clarke playing for the Chelsea first team will remember a defender with a strong work ethic whose positioning was almost always astute and whose passing was clean and precise. In other words a model pro.

Under Jose, as the article points out, he helped marshal a team from the sidelines that had a defensive record which would be unthinkable in today's EPL. When you hear fellow coaches including Mourinho speak about his abilities it is always in terms of 'why has this man waited so long to take a managerial position'. At West Brom it looks as though he has constructed a team that is clever with and without the ball. When you look at the players he is working with, many of whom worked with our current manager RDM, you might think the evolution absolutely startling.

TLDR: This article is the latest in a long line of high profile fuckups by MPs that have eroded what little trust the electorate had in them.

I think that really this is indicative of wider problems in the UK political scene at the minute, broken down into Incompetence, Disconnection, Public Duty and Greed. 

1) Incompetence.

Im sure that everyone has their own anecdote with this, but a lot of what I see with MPs and local councils is staggering incompetence up and down the chain. Off the top of my head we have:

a) The massive gutting of the border agency, which the NAO described as being a pretty bad hatchet job, cutting 1000 more staff than necessary and causing those huge queues at heathrow over the summer.

b) The whole G4s security fuckup with the olympics, but still demanding millions upon millions as part of their contract - costs which spiralled threefold from their original estimate, but the government didnt bother to fully investigate exactly why G4s was inflating their prices.

... and other incidents or contracts that make you really wonder exactly what the hell the minister or civil servant was on when they originally concocted their course of action and the godawful result that has arisen.

2) Disconnection

Again, everyone has their own stories with this, but this year alone, how many U-turns have their been with centralised (let alone local?)  policy or simply bad ideas that have either been directly forced on people, or gone through a summary consultation process only for the original thing to go through despite vociferous public opposition?

Poster children for this on a national scale is the PCC elections - despite that the governments rhetoric that we're bleeding money as a nation, they felt that this merited wasting a hundred million on the election for a scheme that pretty much nobody wants, to then continue to spend something like an extra £3m a year to pay these people for a function that could probably be done better either within the police or in conjunction with local county councils. 

(Additionally, the use of an Alternative Voting system to elect these PCCs when only a scant year ago we were told that AV is too complicated for elections.)

There is a massive disconnect between the people at the top of this country and the average bloke on the street, a disconnect that as far as I can see is causing continued disillusionment and disenfranchising the electorate.

3) Public Duty

MPs (like Dorries or Mensch or whoever else you care to mention) are public servants. Theyre elected because being an MP is (in theory at least) a selfless position, putting forward the views of the people of your constituency on a national level, or just helping out your constituents on a local basis where you can.

Instead, Dorries has just dropped everything and fucked off to the other side of the planet, leaving her aide holding the shitty end of the stick. His interview this week was excruciatingly awkward to listen to. That disabled lady is in some real trouble that Dorries was helping her with, but instead of seeing that problem through to the end Dorries has gone ""fuck this shit, I'm off for a sweet fucking paycheck"".

Same with Mensch. Instead of seeing out her term and bowing out with possibly the only modicum of grace that she would be capable of, she fucks off to America, ostensibly to be with her husband but more likely to further her own commercial interests that she has been promoting alongside her parliamentary duties. *That, after serving on a parliamentary select committee investigating the Murdoch empire, she then accepts a job as the Sun's american correspondent is beyond satire.*

These MPs and others like them are simply reinforcing that disillusionment with the political process. Why bother to vote for somebody to represent you if that person is immediately going to bugger off and promote their own interests?

4) Greed.

Specifically Im thinking of the expenses scandal but really this goes for any MP that is blatantly taking the piss with public money, like renting out their own property to themselves, renting property from their family, residence-flipping or the like. Or ( I think it was Dorries who did this) employing your own daughter as an assistant in your office on a pay scale that is massively out of proportion (IIRC it was on a rate equiv to £42k a year).

For somebody who has done this (or other playing the system) to then claim it was ""an honest mistake"" and essentially walk away with nothing more than a slap on the wrist is godawful. Not only from a morality standpoint of being truly shitty human beings taking all the public money that they can but also terribly damaging to the position of office; and as an insult to the intelligence of the electorate.

Stupid ass topic to even write about. Brendan has the forwards press constantly to win the ball back, thus they are constantly stepping in and ""stomping"" on other players accidentally.  It is all the forwards, not just Luis, the same thing is seen with Sterling a considerable amount and was with Borini before he was hurt.

I simply fail to understand how out of all the things that could have been written about Saturday's game (LFC finishing chances for once, Enrique as a LM, Suarez's leading goal tally, etc...) this dude writes an article highlighting a bullshit statement by Martinez because Suarez accidentally stepped on a player while trying to steal the ball.

Its the style of play we have; forwards aren't defenders, they don't always make clean tackles, and when asked to press there is a higher risk they make these poor challenges when trying to win the ball back.

He's been much more well behaved this year (barring the one obvious flop) and he has been playing brilliantly.  When will people just leave him alone and enjoy his play?  He is certainly one of the most exciting players in the EPL, can't he get a little well deserved PRAISE in the media??!?!?!

For me this shouldn't be a discussion point, its a physical game, shit happens.

I dont believe it was a stamp or he is some kind of serial stamper.

**I genuinely believe some people are just looking for excuses not to like him and villainize him again. They are taking something that would go unmentioned if done by another player and are blowing it out of proportion because its Suarez**

If other fans see Suarez go down they will immediately assume he's dived, if they see him tackle another player they immediately claim he did it with malice and its no different here.

If say Steven Gerrard/Joe Allen/Paul Scholes/Patrice Evra/Lionel Messi/ Ronaldo/Pele made that tackle nothing would have been said. 

Its his tackling style more than anything, he doesnt like to go to ground because hes a mobile attacker and needs to be ready to spring into action, so when he does tackle its a strikers tackle.

His tackling from what Ive seen in other games is based on him just getting the ball away from the players feet, this 'stamping' incident was no more than a quick lunge to knock the ball out of the players control but he moved it out before he could make contact and as a result made contact with the players foot rather than the ball.

Over the same timespan, ITV's viewing share has fallen precipitously and the consolidated ITV plc (merged from Carlton and Granada) is in deep financial shit. The reason for this is not the logo. The reason for this is that rather than investing in *good programmes*, they have churned out the same lowest-common-denominator shite constantly, which has tarnished the actual ITV brand itself. People now associate ""ITV"" with bollocks on the grade of I'm A Celebrity, X Factor and Jeremy Kyle, and as it turns out while those do bring in cash, there are a great many viewers who won't touch them with a bargepole.

A new logo won't change that, the same way the logo before didn't, or the logo before that. But ITV plc don't seem to grasp this. They think all they need to do is switch up the logo and everyone will come flocking back. They forget that people don't care what logo comes before a programme so long as it's a good programme.

Nobody can even estimate the costs of keeping high level radioactive waste safe, but you can be certain that's another bill the UK tax payer is picking up. 

The UK government also underwrites the nuclear industry insurance liabilities. If UK nuclear power companies had to pay market rates for their insurance, it would at least double the per kw/hr price of nuclear electricity. Of course this means that if there's a major nuclear incident in this country then, you've guessed it, the UK taxpayer will have to pick up the bill.

true,Feint1,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,"You know full well that there's a difference between legally lowering your tax bill and wanting to abolishing taxation. You're correct in believing that I'm not sympathetic towards the reason why we pay tax. Huge amounts of it are squandered on socialist nonsense and projects no one even wants.

&gt;Yet you hope for the same mentality to lead to a more charity-based society?

In the sense that those who want to help the less well off have the chance to do so directly rather being taxed and made poor themselves.

&gt;In return, could you be a dear and point out where I said that I couldn't explain my comment?

You never actually gave any evidence for your claim, it was a statement with nothing to back it. I was right to assume you couldn't back it up when you hadn't even attempted to refute my points.

&gt;Being an apprentice on £2.65, I'm right at the bottom of the pay scale.

So am I right in thinking that you don't actually pay any tax on your income? 

The working poor have the most to gain in a low tax society. Lowering VAT, green taxes, fuel taxes and other stealth consumption taxes help the poor the most. The reason you can't afford your own flat or car is because of high taxation.

&gt;The way that you, by your own omission, ""feel sorry"" for me yet you are quick to defend the tax-dodging rich is. . . well, rich.

I defend the people of this country, I don't discriminate based on class.

What's really rich is that you're complaining about the rich not paying enough tax when you don't even pay tax yourself and then I bet you complain about how high the cost of living is while wanting to make it more expensive through taxation.

true,NervousEnergy,eng-yorkshire,Welshman in Yorkshire,"&gt;  You're correct in believing that I'm not sympathetic towards the reason why we pay tax. Huge amounts of it are squandered on socialist nonsense and projects no one even wants.

You're throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Get mad at the wasteful spending, not ""socialist nonsense"" which helps people.

&gt; You never actually gave any evidence for your claim, it was a statement with nothing to back it. I was right to assume you couldn't back it up when you hadn't even attempted to refute my points.

But you write a load of bollocks. You're not worth my time getting into a lengthy argument about your views, which are a warped manifestation of your pessimism and selfishness. I'm not going to go onto a useless crusade to change any of that. However, I would like to maintain the constant peer-pressure you face in the hope that would be a good substitute for you having such libertarian views.

&gt; So am I right in thinking that you don't actually pay any tax on your income?

When I was working 36 hours a week and putting myself through college I certainly paid tax. Socialism is swings and roundabouts. You are helped when you're low, you help out when you're high.

&gt; The working poor have the most to gain in a low tax society. Lowering VAT, green taxes, fuel taxes and other stealth consumption taxes help the poor the most. The reason you can't afford your own flat or car is because of high taxation.

No, the housing bubble is why I will never be able to afford outright home-ownership. Plus, my car is useless in York. Its ready sitting there at my parent's house for when my finances are fluent enough to afford insurance.

&gt; I defend the people of this country, I don't discriminate based on class.

No you haven't. You have only defended your own narrow minded views. The fact that you are trying to falsely take the high road instead of listening to your criticisms is testament to that.

&gt; What's really rich is that you're complaining about the rich not paying enough tax when you don't even pay tax yourself and then I bet you complain about how high the cost of living is while wanting to make it more expensive through taxation.

I pay tax when I can, I don't pay tax when I can't. Its as simple as that.

&gt; You're the typical student socialist.

Is that meant to be some kind of weak insult? Its not very effective. I don't see how somebody being a student is in anyway bad.

Most of the problem in public spending is the socialist nonsense. If we want to live in a fairer society we need to make sure the left stays out of anything to do with state spending.

&gt;But you write a load of bollocks. You're not worth my time getting into a lengthy argument about your views, which are a warped manifestation of your pessimism and selfishness. I'm not going to go onto a useless crusade to change any of that. However, I would like to maintain the constant peer-pressure you face in the hope that would be a good substitute for you having such libertarian views.

So you're not actually going to refute them and instead just say you don't agree?

But again you call me selfish when it's you who is selfish. You want others to subsidies you.

&gt;When I was working 36 hours a week and putting myself through college I certainly paid tax. Socialism is swings and roundabouts. You are helped when you're low, you help out when you're high.

You suffer when you're low and suffer more when you're high. Socialism is about making everyone poorer in an attempt to gain equality. Capitalism is about earning your own living and not relying on others to do it for you.

&gt;No, the housing bubble is why I will never be able to afford outright home-ownership. Plus, my car is useless in York. Its ready sitting there at my parent's house for when my finances are fluent enough to afford insurance.

You're avoiding the point here. Socialism created the housing bubble in the first place anyway.

&gt;No you haven't. You have only defended your own narrow minded views. The fact that you are trying to falsely take the high road instead of listening to your criticisms is testament to that.

You've not even given any criticisms. So far you've called me selfish and my views ""bullshit"". Hardly intellectual arguments.

&gt;I pay tax when I can, I don't pay tax when I can't. Its as simple as that.

So why don't you voluntarily donate money to the state? That's what you're advocating Starbucks do.

&gt;Is that meant to be some kind of weak insult? Its not very effective. I don't see how somebody being a student is in anyway bad. Nor do I see somebody being a socialist in anyway bad either.

Student socialists are the people you see at occupy movements, they're delusional students with little understanding of the world. When you actually get a job and start paying tax you'll see for yourself the hardship it brings.

* It can't decide between hard corners and rounded curves, even within the same character - the I, the cross of the T and the last stroke of the V are all sharp cornered, but everything else is rounded.

* The stroke width varies inconsistently - vertical strokes are thicker than horizontal ones, but not even in a distinctive, definite way as with calligraphy.  Instead it just looks half-arsed.  Oh, and even if you accept this style, the V then completely ruins it by ignoring the pattern and making two similarly-angled strokes different widths.

* The combination of colours looks like shit - they clash horribly, and the crossovers where two colours mix aren't even proper colour-mixes; they're just random other colours with no rhyme or reason to them.  Oh, and even *then* they don't match or have any kind of pattern, because the T is black (not even a colour).

* Quite apart from the *combination* of colours, several of the *individual* colours are nasty.  Just look at that turquoise-blue that's hard to see against lighter backgrounds, or the sick-coloured green.  It seems custom-designed so that it'll look terrible on almost any coloured background.

Literally nothing about this logo is any good - the geometry, the colour-theory, the consistency... none of it.  It's like they've gone out to break every rule of good design they possibly can, in one hideous logo.

In fact it's *so* bad I suspect it's deliberate - when designers deliver several design ideas they sometimes include one or more intentionally-crappy ""sacrifice"" designs intended to influence the clients towards better designs, or away form a particularly bad idea.

This is a bit sneaky and arguably a bit condescending, or it can also be looked at as trying to give the clients the best result you can even in spite of their lack of understanding of design.  However, sometimes it backfires horribly, and the client latches onto an intentionally shitty design and then won't be talked out of it.

The risk of this is multiplied if it's a decision that needs to be made by committee, instead of by one decision-maker who's tractable or has a clear vision.

true,NervousEnergy,eng-yorkshire,Welshman in Yorkshire,"&gt; Most of the problem in public spending is the socialist nonsense. If we want to live in a fairer society we need to make sure the left stays out of anything to do with state spending.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""left"", but if you mean ""compassion"" then I'll have to completely disagree with you there. The state is meant to support us, with compassion.

&gt; So you're not actually going to refute them and instead just say you don't agree?

Pretty much. Its a waste of time. The only person who can convince you otherwise is yourself. I'm fine with prodding you in that direction, but I'm not going to do all the work for you. Call that individualism, if you will.

&gt; But again you call me selfish when it's you who is selfish. You want others to subsidies you.

You know what? I'm too proud to claim housing benefit, but that's because I haven't exhausted all my means yet. For people in a similar position to me, but without lovely parents, then I would want them to get all the help avaliable to them, yes. But that doesn't make me selfish. It just makes me compassionate. I think that wealth gathering at the top damages society as a whole. I'm just advocating wealth to be spread around. I don't think its selfish to ask those who can give to give. It is selfish for those who can give to get indignant though. Afterall, their own wealth is a result of many factors, not just themselves. Those many factors including all the little people feeding into the economy. Wealth is not created in a vacuum.

&gt; You suffer when you're low and suffer more when you're high. 

I don't see how people suffer more when they're high. You're going to have to explain that to me. 

&gt; Socialism is about making everyone poorer in an attempt to gain equality. Capitalism is about earning your own living and not relying on others to do it for you.

Spread the wealth around! It should make those who are better off somewhat **proud** to have a system which supports those beneath them. Afterall, it is those people beneath who created the wealth for many of those above.

 &gt; Socialism created the housing bubble in the first place anyway.

How the fuck did you figure that one out? The fettishisation of high house prices is at the very heart of the housing bubble, ie: treating a house as an investment rather than a home. That doesn't sound socialist to me. Please explain. 

&gt; You've not even given any criticisms. So far you've called me selfish and my views ""bullshit"". Hardly intellectual arguments.

I confess, I'm not an intellectual. But I'm sure that if you stick by your own beliefs you wouldn't mind indulging me in explaining your own position.

&gt; So why don't you voluntarily donate money to the state? That's what you're advocating Starbucks do.

In the same way that I advocate that I don't take the piss, I advocate that Starbucks don't take the piss either. Quite simple, really.

&gt; Student socialists are the people you see at occupy movements, they're delusional students with little understanding of the world. When you actually get a job and start paying tax you'll see for yourself the hardship it brings.

For fuck sake, I'm not a university student, I have had a full-time job in the past, and currently I effectively have a full time job which masquerades as an apprenticeship. I'm fucking *living the hardship of earning £2.65 an hour*. Don't tell me that I don't have an understanding of the world.

If we continue to play the youngsters (which we likely will, given BR's choices at his disposal and the fact that they're playing well), its hard to say due to the inconsistencies associated with typical young players, and unfortunately the inconsistent performances turned out by Suarez (bar his recent beautiful run of form), Gerrard, Reina, Agger, Skrtel, Johnson, Enrique, etc. that this trend will change significantly. That being said, Brendan is a boss manager, but assuming that he will be able to get THE BEST out of Wisdom, Suso, Sterling, etc. EVERY SINGLE WEEK from now until the end of the season is unreasonable of the man. 

So from 78 points, we assume we lose 1/3 of those:

78-26(3pts/game, lose 8.66 games between now and end of season for mathematical purposes) yields 52 available points.

I'm not sure about the draws statistic, but of 52 points available, we're not realistically going to win all of those games.

Yes, 4th is mathematically possible, but people please don't get your hopes up too far. If we finish in any of the European places, this season needs to be considered a rousing success on our part. Change of the sort that wins championships will take time. Consistency is the part of great teams that knee-jerk fans fail to see the most (obviously, given their definition).

Rejoice in the fact that for the first time in a while, Liverpool won comfortably against a team of inferior quality at home. This is something that great teams regularly do over the course of a season, but for the past 3 seasons we have failed to do because we, unfortunately, are not a great team (yet). 

Don't get me wrong now, the future is bright and the future is Red. But the truth is, a future where we win consistently against teams that we SHOULD beat is not here yet BECAUSE we have failed to win consistently. 

Yes, I'm aware that what I am suggesting is that the logic of consistency is demonstrated through consistency. Its a rather strange phenomenon that makes analysis rather difficult to explain and redundant until after the fact, but nevertheless, it is true. West Brom, right now, is deservedly better than us, and needs to be considered as competition for 4th place.

Our good half-seasons are not as good as others, look at Westbrom, they will use what they gain this half to stay away from relegation.

I don't like to admit it, but we are consistently average, winning is no longer the norm, which is what is required of a good team. 7 unbeaten, 3 victories, or 13 points from possible 21 which puts us on the average 1.85 points pr game, if we keep this ""good"" run up, we will be top 4, but if you add the expected fluctuation in form, you have zero chance of top 4.

I wonder when will statistics tell luis suarez that he isn't really supposed to diverge much from his 17 goal tally last season, or that occasionally he should be hitting the woodwork, or maybe predict that reina is top class keeper so statistically over a season his form should be balanced.

Statistics aren't wishes, you can't use them for things that have no causality, that is why despite statistically us having superior probability of beating smaller teams every game, we have our best games against big teams, or wages rather than talent predicting where a team is placed, I wonder when QPR will realize they are top 5 material.

Kenny's, I wasn't able to see him play but reading his book is probably the best insight to the days of when our team was the best in the world, also gets quite emotional during both the tragedies.

Shankley's, it's a great read to see how our foundations were laid and just reading it you can tell he is just the best sort of man, also he talks about life after Liverpool and how hard it was to stay away from the club (also Everton treated him very well after he left Liverpool).

Fowlers, I found quite hard to read, he obviously was a great player and got up to all sorts of mischief, he talks about coping with people calling him a drug addict and dealing with the fame  from a early age...BUT I found it all very cocky, but you eventually accept that haha

true,Feint1,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,"&gt;It is extremist, even for a conservative.

No it's not. Most conservatives think like this. You just don't live in a conservative circle, York is pretty much communist.

&gt;Perhaps in America it is the norm, but in Britain I really do think that deep down we all have socialist tendencies. 

There is an alarming increasing in socialists but only because of resent state and private brainwashing. The fact that you're female also may have something to do with it since women are less in favour of individualism and prefer others to provide for them. It's genetically programmed into women.

&gt;My boyfriend's father is having to go through the whole ATOS thing. Would you be able to tell a disabled man in great pain that tax avoidance and evasion are in no way responsible for all the cuts affecting him?

Tax avoidance and tax evasion have nothing to do with this. What's hurting the system are those claiming from it when they shouldn't be. You used to be able to claim for having a bad back or dodgy ankle. Luckily the government has done a lot to stop that with ATOS.

&gt;As for your vindictive crusade against ""council estate work-shy chavs"", I am concerned that you are lumping together the truly vulnerable into this category, and treating them as simply collateral damage. 

There's a lot of overlap. A low tax society would bring the working poor out of poverty and push those gaming the system into work. It's not that there shouldn't be a welfare state, just that it shouldn't be something everyone is entitled too. There are some households earning more than £25,000 a year on benefits. Getting rid of JSA and replacing it with food vouchers would be a good start.

&gt;Well, you try balancing the budget then: http://youchoose.yougov.com/York/

true,NervousEnergy,eng-yorkshire,Welshman in Yorkshire,"&gt; No it's not. Most conservatives think like this. You just don't live in a conservative circle, York is pretty much communist.

York is pretty much normal.

&gt; There is an alarming increasing in socialists but only because of resent state and private brainwashing. 

I wouldn't say that an increase in socialism is alarming at all. It is a natural reaction to both tough times and an ineffective government.

&gt; The fact that you're female also may have something to do with it since women are less in favour of individualism and prefer others to provide for them. It's genetically programmed into women.

I'm a man.

&gt; Tax avoidance and tax evasion have nothing to do with this. What's hurting the system are those claiming from it when they shouldn't be. 

Whilst every bit of damage is still a bit of damage, I don't think you realise the scale of unclaimed taxes vs. our welfare bill. It just doesn't compare.

&gt; You used to be able to claim for having a bad back or dodgy ankle. Luckily the government has done a lot to stop that with ATOS.

Not luckily at all. I'd much rather have a system that is too generous than one that treats him like a sub-human.

&gt; There's a lot of overlap. A low tax society would bring the working poor out of poverty and push those gaming the system into work. It's not that there shouldn't be a welfare state, just that it shouldn't be something everyone is entitled too. There are some households earning more than £25,000 a year on benefits. Getting rid of JSA and replacing it with food vouchers would be a good start.

You're picking an unrepresentative extreme. Stop treating everything as black and white. Life is a lot more colourful than you give it credit for.

&gt; Cut everything that's not essential and it's pretty easy. It's a pretty unrealistic simulation anyway since it doesn't include efficiency savings and educating workers in fiscal responsibility.

The efficiency savings are taking/have taken place. 18 offices around the city are being condensed into two. Staff are being asked to work from home to save on office space. All perks have been withdrawn. Expenditure over £50 have to be authorized by the chief executive's office. The staff are painfully aware that a lack of fiscal responsibility will cost jobs.

You are correct in saying that the Police Regulations Act of 2003 state that a member of the police force shall not take any active part in politics, but what you are missing is that the Police and Crime Commissioners are not part of THE police force. They are not included in the rank structure, as many people misinterpret.
These people are regulatory bodies, and are replacing Police Authorities. Police Authorities were never a part of ""The Police Force in the UK"", they were an independent body used to regulate the behavior and standards of the police.
When a police and crime commissioner candidate states that he/she follows a political party, he is appealing to people by saying bluntly that he agrees with voters if they support his same party.

Examples include the aforementioned democratic reform and a much closer adherence to nations putting in what they get out of the EU.

As far as Europe goes, UKIP changed the battleground into a 3 and a half party race, and when you've got that many players at the table, you have to start compromising and working with other parties, at least with the Conservatives.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; how would you have it work?

I should start by saying that it's not my idea, or even a new idea. 

In a general election it would apply locally.  So along with your local Conservative, Liberal, Labour, etc., candidates, there would be a ""No Confidence/None of the above"" option.  If that gets the most votes then no-one is elected (unlike the current system where you can not vote or spoil the ballot papers, but it has no effect on the outcome).

Bear in mind that it's very unlikely for the No Confidence option to ""win"" an election, and if it did then there would be a re-election soon after with a good chance of one of the original candidates getting elected anyway.  However, it's important on principle because it allows voters to have a real say over who gets elected or not.  Under the current system we are being given a choice of candidates and told to pick one.  If the choice is between Red Bad Guy and Blue Bad Guy then we have to accept the fact that a Bad Guy is getting elected one way or another.  A no confidence vote allows the electorate to say ""No thanks"" instead of being ignored.

Very little of the bible is accurate at all, also when you compare Huck Finn and the Bible, The ""n word"" is said so much to illustrate what was wrong with southern society from the POV of the late Samuel Clemens. The bible says to kill all nonbelievers, torture, own slaves, and means it seriously as a rulebook for how to be godly. That's a bit like saying Clive Barker's Hellraiser has some fantastic cooking scenes so let's follow it as though it were true.

The point he makes about we have tried every conceivable option to fit him into our system is so true it hurts to think about it. it's getting stupid how it isn't working. If you look at the total costs of Torres, plus the assists we bought to help him, it gets mind boggling. 

There is only one more option left, and that is to use someone else. As he said, Sturridge is actually giving us something to aim at up top, but isn't quite what we need. Start him till January, then invest in someone else. Not necessarily a Talisman striker, not necessarily expensive, just someone that is consistent. 

There is of course other niggles and issues in our team, but they WILL be fixed with time and experience, ie...David Luiz, our Attacking Mids needing to make more of their passing and not just skimming around the edge of the penalty box, Terry &amp; Cole replacements needing more development.

--------------------------

I can see why you mentioned them but your forgetting;

City already have enough class strikers that some class players are stuck on the bench and sure there in the CL but there doing horrible in it, can you really brag about European football if you dont have a chance of winning it?

Arsenals best players in the last 5 years have left this includes 3 captains and the few that are still there are on the verge of leaving, havent won anything in 7 years and they dont want to pay Theo one of there last remaining long time players what he's asking for (surprising considering there ment to be a rich club) that should tell you something. 

United dont need anymore strikers with the likes of RVP, Rooney, Hernandez, Wellbeck (plus I hear there getting lewandowski, dont quote me on that)

Tottenham may have got 4th last season but there not doing much better than us and AVB is already at WAR with his staff and players, plus theres a lot of talk about Bale heading to Madrid, he's been by far there best player. 

Chelsea finished 6th in the table last season and the only reason there in the CL this year is because Drogba was incredible and helped them win it, credit to them they were the underdogs but with the amount they spend every season no player is safe and look at Torres prime example of what under performing at Chelsea gets you! plus there brining in Falcoa

**Right now we're the 5 star option** 

we're a big club looking to spend and rebuild, we got 3 of the best players in the world in their positions, the best Striker in the league and in the league were on the way up.

And if not, then they were really lucky to get their two hearts and different vascular system simultaneously.

Now they're both one dimensionally evil and kill innocents without a second thought when before they were sacrificing their food to help those when famine came. I feel that the reasons the show gave for the changes are flimsy and pretty lazy writing. There are no major females in this show that have redeeming qualities. This episode has ensured that i've given up on any hope for Merlin to be satisfying in the long run outside of great acting on Bradley and Colin's part. Also the knights are fun too I guess.

Also merlin, remember that one time you didn't kill morgana and now she's trying to kill arthur? And you let mordred live? If you were intelligent (or if the writers knew how not to destroy characters for the sake of repetitive episodes with shallow plot lines), you would just assassinate Gwen, it's not that hard since.

Relating back to the 08/09 season, we had 2/3 different scorers every match and a very in-form striker who won't be mentioned.

I just think if we were to mount a serious challenge for the top 4 we need more goals in our team instead of simply relying on Suarez.

true,urkspleen,present,Frank Lampard,"I came here for the same thing. The first consideration is whether or not Torres leaves in the process of getting someone new, as we would get some transfer fee (not nearly as much as we paid for him) and would free up a lot of the wage budget. So in a way this helps determine the price range of striker we're capable of going for. From a football point of view it makes sense for Torres to go if there's someone else brought in, as he's even worse when dealing with competition. However, if this happens we don't fix our second problem with strikers: depth. So whatever transpires, Lukaku should be with us to give the team both options and a defense against injuries/suspensions.

As for who the replacement is, there's a considerable number of questions that need to be answered. Young and unproven or older and experienced? Solid or world-class? What style of striker should he be? Given the amount of youth that has been injected into the team, I wouldn't mind mixing in an older guy who's been around the block. That being said, it would fit our current transfer policy and team philosophy better if we got someone younger. I don't have an answer for this one. Given the amount of creativity and service in the team, we could get world-class production out of someone who's not necessarily at that level, so again there's no clear answer for me. Finally, I'm not so sure that the style of striker matters so much either, so long as he's a good finisher. Our playmakers like the ball at their feet, but unless we need our striker to be crucial in the build up play he doesn't have to be the same. The most important thing in my opinion is the ability of the striker to make chances for himself, which is the problem with Torres. From what I know of his career he never really had that ability: he was the beneficiary of great service from Gerrard, and took advantage of it with really good finishing. Now that he can't do that anymore, its time to move on. 

In the end, the complexities described above will probably mean that that any move we make will be determined in no small part by our targets' availability and price.

&gt;You think it'll last forever, the people and cars and concrete. But it won't. One day it's all gone, even the sky.

Not even potential energy remains.  For in the end, there is only darkness... well at least in the N-space.

Then we could dive into the fact that the Great Old Ones survived from the previous universe and the manifestation persisted through human memory.  This not too dissimilar from the Beast on that impossible planet, well sort of impossible only to the Doctor's current universe view which said the pre-universe was non-existant before the normal space (present view).  However the Disciples of Light in the previous universe disagreed, their technology maintaining the blackhole orbit beyond even that of the Doctor's.  And then there is the Ancient Lights, reliant on stars alignment they survived the Big Bang.  However this is diving really deep, and they were blocked from entering the universe back in season (not serial) 2.  (Relying on silly astrology powers seems to be sort of similar to the previous universe which seemed more like magic.  Personally, anything is ""magic"" where nothing is defined. Point being is they went away too)

All these beings, persistent even from the Universe before, were not eternal but reliant on inherit energy in some form to survive.  As a manifestation of energy seems to be the basis of being exhibiting ""life"".  But all of these beings seemed reliant on a universe itself and therefore defined with respect to time.  Time itself of course changing.

Without jumping down the time vortex of analogies, we were looking to what time lords referred to as the end of the universe, ""event two"".  Well this was a simple collapsing of the universe on itself, being that it is a closed system and the laws of this universe are reliant on entropy, that breaking down of stuff.  (Some Logosomethingsoranother tried venting the entropy, but it came back to kill a portion of the universe.  Point being is they extended the life of the universe well beyond it's initial timeframe.)

Now we cannot consider the discontinuity of the fourth doctor watching space in the written Special Occasions 2 or something I really haven't read.  Honestly I do not remember where I read something about this and it may be an alternate terminating timeline (also known as prose) that existed in the early doctor's life.  (There is a whole [discontinuity guide](http://www.whoniverse.net/discontinuity/ST03.php) to that ""fun"", just Googled it.)

So where were we, oh yeah a model or statuette.  These have mere law-based restrictions and die from natural progression bound by laws outside their control.

But even the Doctor takes the seemingly religious view of a universe, and perhaps this is of true wisdom.  While previous universe beings claim to exist and content may exist in alternate universes, his very definition of being relies on the laws or definitions of the universe.  Even the older beings, some perhaps rewriting some laws as they see fit, ultimately are bound by the constraint of space and time and only moved within it.

When the doctor says that everything ends or talks of the beginning of time, he has a pretty realistic expectation of the Universe's termination.  If nothing persists after that can be defined in terms of the new universe, even time itself, then with no memory it does not exist.

And so my rambling over a few minutes here concludes, but we do no for certain that The Doctor is not a patron of time but coexisting player within the ""vortex"", a maintaining presence but not to dictate of course.  

Everything ends, and you have to wonder if cracks in time or events that have occurred now give the doctor this view.  

Time is not a strict progression of cause to effect, this is told, but there are other beings not constrained by our ""non-linear"" ""non-subjective"" viewpoint that may argue this fact.  The Doctor however exists and view reality in how he already understands a great deal of time (and may still be learning).

TL;DR: Nothing lasts and time is subjective but is only viewed alternatively without coherent definitions. All entities rely on a realization of some energy or form which is ultimately is rooted in time and therefore eventually ends.  By definition of the known universe, all things end.",0,1353302345,null,0,false,0,c73jto1,t3_13ezwk,t1_c73jto1,t1_c73igkg,null,1430443883,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

Do you think it's just as simple as whole swathes of unemployed people considering certain types of jobs ""beneath"" them? Lack of advertising on the companies' part? Poor recruitment systems?

A number of factors will be at work, but I do think the wage/benefits ratio is a significant one.

I was on benefits some years ago, and when I got a job, the wage difference was £50 a week.

So in essence, I was working for just over a quid per hour, and while I was barely surviving on benefits, it is not difficult to see why someone might look at a job paying the equivalent of £1.10 per hour and wonder why they should bother with it.

I was of the opinion that the crap job would lead to a better job, but if you live in an area where there are no better jobs, why bother slogging your arse off for such a tiny wage?

There was also the cost of transitioning from benefits to wages. When you are scraping along on fortnightly payments, to suddenly have that cut off and no wages for 4-6 weeks simply isn't possible for a lot of people.

They are -- to use the catchphrase -- trapped on benefits.

I was very keen on Iain Duncan-Smith's proposals to amend the transition phase so that people have financial help during the difficult first few months when benefits run out faster than wages arrive - but then we had a recession, and the plans were cancelled.",0,1353323489,null,0,false,0,c73mv12,t3_13g1m2,t1_c73mv12,t1_c73msvy,null,1430445391,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I lean towards less insistence on raising the level, but to counter that, you need to have the ability for a person to take a low-wage job when that is all that is available, in the knowledge that they can work their way up the wage ladder.

That requires a better range of jobs in areas that lack them, so that people can see a reason for taking low-paid jobs in order to build up the career skills that lead to better jobs in the medium to long term.

That is less about hiking costs for businesses (and their customers) and more about targeting investment in areas that lack it.

The difficulty with applying a bit more stick to those who might ""choose"" to avoid low-paid work is that you can end up with employers being forced to take on unwilling staff who wont do the job.

That isn't good for anyone.

In the second one, however, the theme is not as obvious at the first glance and it still represents one of the greatest moments of that season.

If I could suggest, get more paintings like the second one - frames with an atmosphere and feeling behind it, while at the same time it being a great picture even for a non-Whovian.

Matt Smith is a great doctor and his stories are awesome. However, his companions aren't my favourite and I really cannot decide what moments would look the best painted. I believe that anything without obvious SF elements is great - or perhaps something drawn in another style. For example, the TARDIS exploding by Vincent as something a bit abstract.

true,DirtySketel,eng-merseyside,Liverpool,"Cannabis is almost completely non-toxic. According to the *New England Journal Of Medicine* ”a smoker would theoretically have to consume nearly 1,500 pounds of marijuana within about fifteen minutes to induce a lethal response.”.

It is also not physically addictive, although like almost everything, some people will develop a psychological dependence (a phenomenon not exclusive to drugs — see eating, self-harm, World Of Warcraft...).

Cannabis use does correlate with psychotic disorders, but a causal link has never been found, and similar correlations can be drawn with all drugs, including things like caffeine and tobacco. As cannabis use within a population increases, no increase in psychosis rates have been found.

Cannabis has been found to lower IQ of users who began in adolescence, but not those who began in adulthood. Mothers who smoke during pregnancy do risk giving their child cognitive defects.

One thing that cannabis *has* been shown to effect is testicular cancer risk (0.4% to 0.6%).

Another potential harm of cannabis is of course effects on driving and operating heavy machinery.

So, while all drugs have the potential to cause harm, I would say that cannabis is mostly harmless. The worst effects seem to be on young smokers whose brains and bodies are still developing.

On the other hand, nicotine can be lethal in doses of 30-50mg, and is highly addictive.

The first day he turned up at 10.30am procrastinated for a couple of hours about the problems he was going to face, unplumbed the sink unit and stripped the laminate floor from the kitchen ( and then talked about wanting another £100 to remove all of the rubbish ) he left around 4.30: ""Fridays... innit.""

By this point my mate is fuming, he just wants his kitchen done.

We're leaving Wickes and this guy is hanging around the exit so my mate goes over: ""You after some work by any chance?""

The overlapping parts in different colours suggest that you should include the overlapped parts in your interpretation of both the included letters.

But u doesn't have a dot or a crossed bit...

Same for the next two letters.  Overlap where there shouldn't be any, t becomes a weird u thing with a cross.

Then we have the problem that mixing those individual letter colours doesn't get you those overlap colours in any model I know of.

They sell everything you used to buy on the high street *but* they have free parking and you only have to go to one place.  This competition starts to kill high street stores - the smaller one go first.  The council now has a lot of empty properties on their high street - this represents a significant reduction in business rates and the only way it can continue to not increase people's council tax (especially as their budgets are still being cut annually for the next couple of years) is to increase those rates.  This forces further businesses out of business and even the big, still profitable chains will have a rate they aren't prepared to go over.  It becomes a cycle.

Practical upshot: empty high streets, everyone buys everything at a supermarket, your council tax goes up.  Or another way of looking at it: you eventually end up paying more for that great big Tesco that pays really low rates and has shut down all the local businesses than you even realise.

So no we don't need a rate freeze; we need to stop building megastores in fields on the edges of towns and start charging them (along with their fair share of tax) realisitic business rates for their properties.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"I think this is an important intervention, and Miliband is exactly correct. Britain has plenty of potential allies for reshaping Europe in the direction we would wish, as a trade bloc rather than a United States of Europe, but we have spurned them by behaving as an unreliable ally. Poland, Sweden or Denmark cannot explicitly put themselves in our camp because they never know whether we will even be a member in ten years. Even Germany doesn't want to be left with a more protectionist Southern bloc, and has recently made overtures for an alliance on various issues. But the British Prime Minister is rarely left with the negotiating space to make deals in the British interest. 

And this is where Miliband comes across as hypocritical, because it's not two weeks since he himself tied Cameron's hands in EU budget negotiations. Miliband allied with Tory eurosceptics to put a motion through parliament, making it clear that the overall budget must be frozen, when it would be better if Cameron had freedom to manouvre. For instance, he could agree to a slight raise, in exchange for moving money from the CAP (agricultural subsidies) towards scientific research or infrastructure investment. I believe that Britain's scientific preeminence means that we receive something like 40% of the science funding for the entire EU. That would mean that France would be blocking any deal (because they have said they will veto any CAP cut) and France would come across as the obstructionist bad guys.

This was found not to be the case, however, as the ammunition was found to have been moved under his bed, and the case had been opened.

The court found that at some point, he *did* discover the pistol. Whether he forgot about it afterwards doesn't really matter, as he made no attempt to hand in the ammunition and gun later on.

true,Stormwatch36,cyberman,Cyberperson,"People are going to realize with time that the season-long arcs for 5 and 6 just weren't handled well whatsoever. For the moment we're all still in a honeymoon phase with them because we like the show, but basically know that you're completely right if you think the whole thing made no sense.

This is how it has been explained to me: The power of Amy's deep-rooted subconscious memory of Rory somehow manifested him as an Auton in the Roman army. I believe this may have been further explained as something along the lines of the Nestene consciousness drawing from people's memories in order to craft those Autons, but I would have to re-watch it.

Rory, as an Auton, waits outside the Pandorica for Amy for 2000 years. The universe gets ""rebooted"", with The Doctor on the wrong side of the cracks. This means that, like Rory when he got sucked into the crack outside the Silurian city, he never existed. Despite this, Amy's memory of him is powerful enough to make her still have him as an 'imaginary friend' as a child, and when she expresses that memory hard enough on her wedding day, she is able to bring him back into existence using her mind. The Doctor's presence in the 'new' universe also restores Rory's memory as an Auton despite the fact that the Big Bang 2 restored him to a human form.

It's never covered whether Amy has some sort of inherent power that makes her memories more powerful than the average Joe's, or if she was only able to bring back The Doctor as a freak one-off miracle. As I said at the start of this post, this story was not told very well at all, as is evidenced by people *still* trying to figure out what happened. We still don't know why the TARDIS exploded, and at this point we will never know the explanation for why Amy was allowed to bring The Doctor back just by thinking really hard after the cracks were sealed.

TL;DR: The Season 5 story arc was told in a confusing way, with a lot of information being presented as one-off lines, and a lot of *other* information completely unexplained whatsoever.

true,soopasloth,null,null,"Currently doing work experience at a company in Austria and after 4 months I still feel that life is FAR better here.

Trade unions are/were really strong so work contracts are excellent, pay is ok. I have things in my contract like I can't work on the weekend, which is awesome. You're paid 13 months pay a year, and the 13th is tax free (instead of an unknown yearly bonus). If I get sick on my holiday I get those holiday days back (I get the same number as in the UK, whatever that is, including bank holidays). They don't do references here, instead you get a certificate that says ""you completed your contract correctly"" which means that if your boss breaks your contract and you quit you still get the equivalent of a good reference, on the same note if my job changes from what I was hired to do I have the option to leave and not be left with a black mark on my employment history. When you've got employment laws like this it leads to an environment where workers are respected, even if they are just shelf stackers.

Generally life is excellent, Austrians are very professional (it's not just a stereo type), polite and friendly. In the area I'm in (Steyr) there is almost no crime, kids hang around on street corners because the weather is nice not because they are drinking (that is taking some getting used to, I lived in dodgy neighbourhood in the UK). People leave bikes around, unlocked!

Public transport is EXCELLENT. It's all still publicly owned, so there metric is not profit but quality of service. I'd been here for 2 months and my bus was 4 minutes late and I freaked out thinking it had gotten into a crash, I'd gotten so use to it turning up precisely on time. 

There is a political campaign here to give under 18s and students free public transport, because they feel it's important children should be independent/should be able to experience the world, the only thing politics in the UK are concerned about is limiting what children can do, this seems a far healthier attitude. I've not had much experience of politics here but generally they seem to be very sane and well thought out.

Restaurants are really cheap in comparison for some reason too. A pizza is €5, including a can of coke.

Also mobile phones and internet are really cheap: 1000 minutes and SMS, 1Gb fast as it can data then 64Kb/s there after is €7.50. I pay €12.50 for a 20Gb mobile internet sim and just use Skype on my phone (so I can't actually make normal calls...). As for internet you can get 100/10Mb for €44.90, which includes line rental etc.

The (kind of) bad:

Food is more expensive, but it's of FAR higher quality, there are bakers everywhere which make Tescos bread seem like the crap it is.

Everything (except bakers and restaurants/cafes) closes on a Sunday and the government pays money to the Catholic Church (this might change as young people are very opposed to this, and it's mainly the old who support it apparently). I find the Sunday thing pretty annoying, but that's really as I've not got friends/family/girlfriend here (they are all back in the UK) to spend time with which is what the locals seem to do on a Sunday (that or mountain biking/skiing); In summer the parks are full of families out for a walk before/after going for a Sunday meal together, or couples walking/spending time together, it's sickeningly cute.

Considering the illegal activities forced upon him by the government as his role requires in the SAS, if in the context of civilian laws. When such resultant actions that he is charged of, occur as a result of that enforced illegality. 

Upon a return to a life where a different set of laws apply, if those laws have been broken as a result of his military service where his human rights and the law is ignored by the govt; (comas, freely gifted weapons, ammunition, provision of international arms transport) and he is then deemed to have undertaken illegal activities for a civilian, but when serving in the military it is the government who legally take responsibility of their soldiers actions, this incident is an extension of the result of the actions he has undertaken by the behest of the govt, the govt has not only facilitated but created this situation, therefore the government should take responsibility for this incident.


If the government was legally treated as he is, they would be charged with GBH and arms trafficking.

&gt;""Suarez has a high-risk tackling technique. This has already been alluded to by a couple of posters. He attempts to gain an extra advantage from a tackle by getting his body between the opponent and the ball so that the opponent comes up against his back. When it's executed well it means that Suarez is already turning away from the challenge when it comes. 

&gt;Think of the Zidane roulette. He did something similar, turning his back into the tackler and simultaneously shielding the ball and moving it along with the sole of his boot. This is high-risk though. If your opponent is brave and committed (and most English defenders are) they are going to stretch for that 50-50. That's what happened here. Luis tried to get his foot on the far side of the ball only to discover the defender had stretched and poked it away. He got his ankle instead. 

&gt;It's not a stamp, but it looks like a stamp when it goes wrong because Suarez's foot is coming down vertically over the ball rather than stretching horizontally towards it. 

&gt;As risky as this form of dispossession is, Suarez shouldn't rule out doing it. His play is all about doing two things where an opponent thinks he's going to do one. A Suarez tackle, for example, often becomes a turn as well. Similarly the Suarez nutmeg is often so devastating because it can happen with his first touch. Opponents are expecting him to cushion a pass, but he cuts out the cushioning bit and goes straight to the nutmeg. This is why he appears to be so quick, even though he lacks essential foot-speed.""

The milk goes into the cup before the tea. The tea is brewed separately, in a tea pot, because the water must be boiling hot to brew properly.

The only problem arises when one wants to avoid using a teapot, through some sort of perversion that I imagine only the basest of people indulge in.

Look, it's very simple: tea and boiling water in pot, brew. Milk in cup, tea follows slowly, so as to avoid stewing the milk.

Though, of course, if you want *proper* tea, it should be taken with a slice of lemon rather than milk. And a decent brand of tea does not require sugar.

So if you ever see anyone arguing over whether the milk or the water go into the *cup* first (or, heaven forbid, a *mug*), then you can simply remark that they are *both* wrong, and strike a haughty pose with nose aloof.

&gt;""I've been asked if we have someone who can get us 30 goals this season,"" Rodgers says. ""I don't think it matters whether we do or not. **If we are going to get into the Champions League we need to score 65 plus,** and to achieve that we need the whole team to be scoring. Centre-halves, full-backs, midfielders are all going to have to weigh in. I think we have enough quality at the front to get goals but they have to come from other areas as well. City scored 93 goals last year, United 89, Arsenal 74 and Tottenham 69. So that's the target area, that's what we need to work towards.""

Points are generally the way we look at these sorts of things but to look at a potential run at 4th place from a number-of-goals-scored perspective is also interesting.

So, taking the teams ElevenReds mentioned above, then taking a very simple ""goals-per-match"" approach to it and projecting out through the last 26 matches of the season... we have:

1. Manchester United: 25 goals thus far over 12 matches played + (2.42 goals-per-match x 26 games remaining) = **91.92** goals

2. Manchester City: 25 goals + (2.08 gpm x 26) = **79.08** goals

3. Chelsea: 24 goals + (2.00 gpm x 26) = **76** goals

4. Arsenal: 23 goals + (1.92 gpm x 26) = **72.92** goals

5. Everton: 22 goals + (1.83 gpm x 26) = **69.58** goals

6. Spurs: 20 goals + (1.67 gpm x 26) = **63.42** goals

* Liverpool: 17 goals + (1.42 x 26) = **53.92** goals

(Apologies in advance if some of the math is wrong but you get the idea).

Not exactly the most scientific approach and obviously this doesn't include other teams like, say, Fulham who have 25 goals but generally aren't considered a threat to a Champions League spot (probably because they've conceded 22 goals this season).

And, obviously, this is a sort of as-it-stands sort of look and does not take into consideration things like injury, loss of form, new transfers, etc.

As for Carra's recent statements and the danger of raising expectations in a transitional season such as this, I don't have a problem with it at all. The goal for Liverpool FC (and frankly every club, realistic or not) should be *at least* a top 4 position. Nobody wants to strive for mediocrity. Of course, there's the issue of saying it out loud and speaking about it privately.

However, I think Carra sets the tone and the bar for the squad (especially the youngsters) that this is Liverpool Football Club and what we strive for each season is at least 4th place if not a title but coupled with an understanding that we are transitioning this season. I don't think Carra is delusional in that respect.

true,FlorentineEagle,null,null,"Alex Murray and a small group of others (about 50 students) are attempting to have BAE banned from campus on the grounds that it's morally wrong to support a company that essentially profits from war and all who support BAE are complicit in murder (Murrays' words). 

The issues with this are firstly this will significantly impact the employability for science students as (again Murrays' words) first BAE, then the rest. The job market isn't the greatest and we need as much help as possible, if BAE are banned then that's a kick to the teeth for anyone that wants to work for them (of which there are quite a few especially within physics). 

This then brings a domino effect of both the precedence of banning such companies and the possibility that companies could be preemptively scared off from our employability fayres. 

Another issue is Murray brought this onto the agenda for the Democracy Zones last Friday about half hour before the meeting, meaning no-one was prepared for it and it's ended up on an all student vote which opens on Wednesday. There has been no information given out freely to all students but I would put money on the fact the Murray and co will have made sure their sympathisers will know. If it passes the SU can petition the university to ban BAE from campus and also the SU will be mandated to stop BAE from entering the site.

Murray promised in his manifesto that he would help the sciences as much as possible but he's done nothing so far and now this is a clear move against us, with the possibility of more to come.

Finally who the hell does this group think they are to tell everyone else what to think and do. We are all graduate students who can think for ourselves and have our own moral compasses.

true,B4mf0rth,null,null,"The only convincing argument for legalisation seems to be that it is not worth the resources and time society puts towards criminalising the vast majority the people who use it. 

However:

 - the drug is harmful. It is carcinogenic, it is bad for your lungs, it very bad for your brain, whether or not other traditional drugs like tobacco and alcohol are worse is irrelevant, cannabis does have negative health effects. 

 - licencing it for medical use will just encourage widespread abuse. Anyone who knows anything about California and Colorado's trials of medicinal marijuana knows that you can go to any doctor and claim of ""chronic general pain"" and get a prescription. I find it hard to believe that the only way to get the benefits it apparently has for sufferers of cancer/certain diseases can only be obtained by giving them a bag of weed when we can easily isolate and synthesize the specific chemicals involved and administer them in pill form instead. 

 - Nowhere near enough people care. Some estimates go up to [two million users](http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/expertadvice/problems/alcoholanddrugs/cannabis.aspx) but the vast majority of the country will have a conservative (don't rock the boat) apathy towards legalisation as it seems our country can function perfectly well without it.

 -  This is furthered by the fact that no one has any sympathy for people who smoke weed. It's a choice and its a purely hedonistic pursuit, so it's very hard to drum up much support among people who don't smoke, particularly MP's.

 -  The argument that alcohol and tobacco are way more dangerous and addictive and cause more social problems and blah blah blah doesn't hold. They are traditionally legal, and that is that. The mere fact that something is harmful and legal doesn't by any means entail that we should legalise other things which are harmful but just slightly less so. 

/r/trees seems to present legalisation as an answer to all of life's questions,  but in reality, I doubt stoners will convince voters that in a world of wars, violent crime, lack of jobs and economic opportunity, climate change and resource scarcity, that legalisation of cannabis is a goal worth serious attention.",0,1353348325,null,0,false,0,c73rgkf,t3_13ewtx,t1_c73rgkf,t3_13ewtx,null,1430447569,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4

It is possible to live in the same house but not household, and argue not a stable relationship. You will have the DWP in your personal business and have at most a slim chance of getting benefit after a lengthy appeal.

How about looking at tax credit entitlement ? You are on a very low income and working full time, so claim for that. (can even work if the earner is not full time, without children you need full time hours but there is a completely legal loophole that counts all self employed hours including work done to build up business etc. So one of you sets up a business and counts hours spent advertising or leafleting or going door to door, so many hours even with no income and tax credit cab be claimed. Very good help to get started as self employed potentially).

If the episodes are not going to be connected by a coherent overarching plot line, I think I would like to see more use of powers by both the gang and others.

With only having 6 or 7 episodes a year there either isn't time for throw-away episodes and things should be geared towards a larger goal, or the pacing needs to be a little faster since nothing is connected, each story has to be inclusive. 

Ultimately last season fell flat for me because it seemed like we were just waiting around for the resolution of the time-line story, the rest of the season wasn't interesting (as a whole, parts were interesting) and this episode feels just like that to me.  We spent the whole thing kind of dicking around while they tried to get to the big ending.

Its a complete joke the insurance industry currently exactly because statistics are utilised.

The only way to fix the system is to base the entire industry on the model of nationalised insurance, the insurance is taken up front at a value of 10% of the cars price, you buy a car from someone for £5000 you pay £500 to the national insurance company, you crash then you get the current value of your car (which would probably devalue if you crash it after a year), if you suffer personal injury, thats a seperate system as with slipping in an office, theres no such thing as business insurance for employers being mandatory, if people wanted to take out personal injury claim insurance (which is the bulk of the price as you say) then they can do that voluntarily.

They use a similar system in Australian insurance, for an 18 year old in New South Wales is around £500 for a v8 Jaguar (not that I would reccommend it for a new driver) in the UK if your lucky to be insured over £10,000.

true,victoriaj,uk,London,"You can have a sexual relationship and not count as a couple. 

The benefits system is weird and can be very harsh and unreasonable but where it's based on case precedent and not the legislation it's got a pretty could sense of real life. 

Sharing a bed and bedroom counts towards being a couple for this purpose. But most of the things are financial - sharing financial planning. Any joint bank accounts. Shopping and cooking as a family. Doing your washing together. 

Relationships have to be stable, and there are a number of decisions giving precedent for people not to be found to be couples when they have been having sex - as shown by having children together. Generally relating to the ex who hangs about, sleeps on and off on the sofa, gets into the bedroom again once or twice and still takes no responsibility when there's another baby. (Yes, multiple cases like this and those are just the ones that reach upper tribunals). 

If you are in a relationship with all the financial couple-ness and don't have sex you're still going to be deemed a couple. It's at least possible for friends to get designated as couples.

Living Together as Husband and Wife is a very interesting subject if you like benefit law (and I kind of did once upon a time). These days it's also possible for this to apply to same sex couples or theoretically same sex friends (never seen a dispute about a same sex couple and it doesn't seem like the DWP are throwing accusations around - I have seen someone who wouldn't make a joint claim because they'd rather risk fraud charges than tell the DWP they were gay).

There is at least one other individual in the company who can't yet speak German, so they are willing to hire foreigners. 

Having said that I'm not sure how you'd cope in other industries, Austria is very friendly but the area I'm in is not exactly metropolitan (it is a wee town in the middle of the countryside); Vienna is much more international and I'm sure you'd be able to live/eat/get on with life very happily but I'm not sure how good the employment prospects are. 

There are certainly jobs, there is the same Polish worker migration here as there is in the UK (working in catering mainly, as far as I can tell), however you might find yourself working in McDonald's until you can learn the language better.

I'm a bit ashamed that before I came here I knew no German. I had a months notice that I *might* be coming here and just two weeks rush so I didn't even have time to learn some basics... I've tried language lessons and not gotten very far (evening classes are truly exhausting after a days hard work) but I have learnt enough to get by in the shops and in restaurants in this time and slowly learn a little more every day.

I really liked Vienna, it's vibrant and exciting, also the trams work really well. I was told to be careful as ""there is a lot of crime"" however one day I forgot a shopping bag (with a handbag I'd bought for my girlfriend inside it) outside the Leopold Museum for 2 hours and upon coming back it was still in the spot I'd left it: if it was the UK I'm sure the police would of blown it up!

Also if you're exploring more try searching for Wien (which is the Austrian name for Vienna). And if you plan to visit then [ÖBB](http://www.oebb.at/) (the public transport website) is excellent for planning journeys, although I'm not sure if they do Vienna's trams (which I thought were so cool, you don't get asked for a ticket, in Austria they expect people to be honest enough that they'll buy one without being asked (there may also be steep fines if you are found without a ticket, dunno... So when in Vienna do as the Austrians do :P ))

Assuming alcohol and tobacco are, if taken in proportionally equal and excessive quantities, more harmful than cannabis (which is questionable). 

Alcohol and tobacco aren't illegal because of the standard of harm they cause. The reason that we are allowed to drink isn't because we don't consider alcohol to be harmful. They are legal because of history, tradition and civil development. This fact that they are an ingrained part of our culture overrules the harm that they do. 

Cannabis has not been legal since 1928, and even before then its use was not even comparable to tobacco or alcohol. It therefore doesn't have the ""ingrained part of our culture"" counterweight to the harm that it does. 

So, that alcohol and tobacco may do harm than cannabis is irrelevant because the reason they are legal is nothing to do with the harm they cause.

Sandro is really the only somewhat unknown player (and really anyone who followed Brazilian football even slightly would probably dispute that) that we signed on on the cheap because of his attributes. 

It's like Levy is terrified of being seen as someone who takes risks on young or obscure players--it's as if he feels the need to dangle the carrot of big names in front of us to make us look ambitious, only to make very safe signings.

I'm not saying we've done poorly--our business has been quite good in recent years. Hugo, Mousa, Ade, Vertonghen, Parker, VDV have all been good signings and I'm not ready to completely give up on Gylfi and Clint. 

What I'm wondering is how these teams like Newcastle and West Brom and Wigan and Swansea can sign obscure yet extremely functional players from random leagues while we never do this?

Will our fans get upset if we bring in someone who isn't well-known? West Brom signed their midfield pivot for less than half of what we paid for Dempsey, and it's more functional than our injury-riddled group. 

There are hundreds of players out there in smaller leagues who could improve our team, but we only seem to buy ""proven"" topflight players without any consideration for attributes or a system we want to play. 

Perhaps not what you all want to hear after the weekend but I do wish we had more of a consistent philosophy like Arsenal. I realize their model is not leading to silverware, but it's leading to fiscal stability and perennial CL football.

Everything they do, from developing players to buying them, is done with the consideration of how they want to play. This is why they can survive injury crises better than us--their backup and youth players have been purchased or developed to play the same system and style. They can lose 3 midfielders and still have people who are comfortable on the ball and capable of passing and moving. We lose 2 and we're down to long ball merchants, pure destroyers, and whatever Livermore is. 

If you were building a possession-based team that wants to play fast and intricate combinations and press relentlessly, would you sign Clint Dempsey? If you wanted to play a rotating 4-3-3 in which all 3 players require agility and composure, would you sign Gylfi Sigurdsson? It's not only detrimental to our team but it's unfair to these proven talented players. 

My hope is that Levy agrees with me and wants to aim towards embedding a concrete and specific system and style. The new training ground and success and style of our youth teams are making me believe this is the case. They are playing very tidy possession football.

I just hope the signings start to reflect this. The options are endless but we don't seem aware of this. I would kill for a player like Claudio Yacob or Joe Allen right now. These weren't big names 2 years ago; they were recognized because their attributes fit a style of play. There are players out there that 90% of our fans won't have heard of that could really add something to our team but we never seem to want to go that route. 

**TL;DR**: We should take more risks on cheap obscure players and stop buying players entirely based on a ratio of profile to price. Players should be purchased and developed almost exclusively with their attributes and how they will fit into a system being the biggest considerations.

But teams like Wigan and West Brom don't exactly have that kind of continuity and yet they still have more clear purpose behind their transfer policies, and they still manage to find affordable obscure players with great skillsets for modern football. 

I think a team can have an identity without massive continuity at manager. It's hard to imagine Barcelona straying from what they do anytime soon. They will appoint managers based on the philosophy of the club. 

All I'm saying is we should aspire to have a more concrete mandate. We have a very vague philosophy of playing attacking and attractive football. That's nice, but it doesn't really guide the way we do business.

Knife(Criminal) vs Unarmed(Law abiding citizen) 
is an unfair fight, Not equal, Advantage to the criminal or how ever you want to describe it. 

Where as

Gun(Criminal) Vs Armed (Law abiding citizen) is an equal fight, The citizen has equal chance of putting up a fight and defending themselves. They accept a possible increase in risk (Though that is debatable) for the fact that citizens can be equal in their defence. Not that I agree with this or anything, That is just as I understand it. Also note that not all criminals are armed , I cant find the figure but i remember reading during assaults/Muggings etc only 16%~ of criminals had a visible firearm. The majority of the time, The situation will actually be:

Criminal(Unarmed/Knife) Vs Armed (Law abiding citizen) in which case the citizen (though not 100% safe) has the advantage. Hence why there is an estimated 2 million cases of firearms being used in self defence (Both carrying and in home)  every year.

Again, Not saying I completely agree with this, But this is just as i understand it. Either-way there are undoubtedly pros and advantages to this sort of gun control (or lack of), Whether they outweigh the perceived negatives is a up to you.

""As I said, massive assumptions made by all. We don't know the full story. One assumption I could make is that he never wanted or expected his email to his children to be printed in the Telegraph.

I know a lady who is a single mother with an only child, now aged 23. Since his birth, he has not had a father and my friend (the mother) has devoted her entire life to her son. He has (so far) stolen from her, failed to hold down any job for more than a month, threatened her physically and abused her mentally. He is the epitome of 'Nasty Nick' from EastEnders. One could comment on her poor parenting skills, but then no-one teaches us how to be parents. She did her best, as we all do.
If I were to write an email to her son, it would be more damning than the one printed in the Telegraph by a significant degree. He'd deserve it too; but I'd be the ""cock"", apparently.""

I am a parent with three children, aged 23, 21 and 16. My eldest son (aged 21) is Asperger's. I am stupidly proud of all my kids and try to spend time with them when I can. However, I am freelance and spend most of my weeks away from home, and my wife bore the brunt of their upbringing; a bit like our sub driver in the Telegraph. I empathise with his position, and I want to know more about what led him to communicate with his children in the way that he did. I am not willing to condemn him out of hand.

To reiterate: no-one gives parents a manual when our kids are born. We do the best we can. Often, we fail. We get little credit from onlookers when we do things right and nothing but opprobrium when we, ahem, fuck up.

This is pretty common in plant-based foods, and generally speaking the more ""natural"" the food the more toxic it is - selection and processing tend to reduce levels of natural toxins. On the other hand, plant-eaters adapt too, so the toxins tend not to be that harmful in general. In fact people consume some things *because* of the toxins.

These days, a more serious risk with potatoes is diabetes. The carbohydrates in potatoes are complex, which is supposed to mean a low glycaemic index, minimal variations in insulin levels and minimal health risk. But like many foods that are very rich in complex carbohydrate, potatoes are pretty much indigestible until you cook and otherwise process them - and that breaks down carbohydrates and makes them much easier to digest quickly. The carbohydrate from mashed potato is absorbed so rapidly, it's not much better than eating sugar. A lot of modern bread is the same basic story.

Obviously all the sugar in modern snacks and drinks is the *real* thing behind diabetes, but potatoes, bread and other cooked/processed complex carbohydrates play a significant part too.

Luckily almost all of the serials are stand-alone, and even most of those that aren't don't really rely on the arc to make sense.

For obvious reasons I'm only recommending serials that have survived the BBC archive wipes of the 70s, or which have no more than one episode missing.

* First Doctor: The Aztecs, The Ark, The Tenth Planet

* Second Doctor: Tomb of the Cybermen, The Mind Robber, The War Games

* Third Doctor: Inferno, The Dæmons, The Three Doctors, The Green Death

* Fourth Doctor: The Ark in Space*, Genesis of the Daleks*, Pyramids of Mars, Talons of Weng-Chiang*, The Keeper of Traken

* Fifth Doctor: Kinda*, Earthshock, Snakedance (reliant on Kinda), Caves of Androzani*

* Sixth Doctor: Vengeance on Varos, The Two Doctors

* Seventh Doctor: Remembrance of the Daleks*, Battlefield*, Ghost Light, Curse of Fenric, Survival

The quality dropped off starting with the Fourth Doctor's last seasons (Douglas Adams was not really that good a head writer, brilliant as he was at individual serials, and the writers/producers mostly seemed to get lazy with the show in the 80s) so while the first four Doctors have countless other serials worth a watch, I wouldn't recommend very much of what the Fifth through Seventh Doctors have to offer.

The exception being the Seventh Doctor's third and last season, from 1989, where every episode was clever and original and well written and acted.

Nightingale had a 9mm Glock illegally in his possession. He pleaded guilty to this - it's done. 

Rayment - the article's author - mentions that the sentencing has been described as the “betrayal of a war hero” and in the comments section of the article over 1600 people have ""liked"" a comment to similar effect. 

Therefore there's strong opinion that he should be let off the hook in light of his military service/background. 

*Therefore* where does that line of thought end? If it's OK for him to get away with it, why not every military or ex-military person? How do we define why it's OK for him and not anyone else (in accordance with UK law)? What if it were a sawn-off shotgun rather than a pistol? Does the type of weapon matter as well? 

And in turn, is it so illogical to explore the ownership of firearms in general? If 1600+ people are agreeing that this man shouldn't be prosecuted for breaking the law and owning such a firearm... *why is he so special* and not me? Not you? Not Farmer Jim or Jim Jimson on the street? 

You're quick to label all that a fallacy, but very slow to explore it. Why?

It does vary from person to person, so in the office just ask. 
The thing to work out is what YOU enjoy, for when people ask you.

My personal recommendation:
In a mug - Tea bag in, boiling water, stir and leave for 2-3 minutes till a dark colour is achieved. Add a dash of milk (less than you would for coffee). Sweeten to taste.
With a tea pot - Warm the pot with the steam from the kettle. Then add tea bags. A general rule is ""one for each person and one (extra) for the pot"". Add boiling water to the required amount and leave for ~3 minutes. Add a bit of milk to each cup while waiting, then pour in the brewed tea. Add sweetner if desired.

When you say ""tea"" people will assume black tea (I think it's ""english breakfast""). 
The next standard is ""Earl Grey"". This is a slightly citrus tea, that is a weaker taste but I recommend it - convention is to drink with lemon but if you're not using a cup and saucer why follow convention?
""Chai"" is a weaker tea still, infused with cinnamon and other warming spices. This is a fairly recent (2 year) discovery of mine and i'm still amazed every time. Try when you're having a bad day.
""Lemon &amp; Ginger"" - when you're ill, add honey. It wont heal anything but it will make you feel better.

You no longer need to differentiate between computers in different departments as every machine has the same image and applications are served based on user login. This means you can centralise a large chunk of your staffing and remove the need for complex application installation management.

The other advantage is it then puts you in a position to sell virtualised app services to other smaller universities. For example a very large university could come to a volume licencing agreement with chemdraw and then sell on virtualised usage of it to other small institutions. Chemdraw have the advantage of working with a single institution, provide support to a single installation and have their customer reselling their product on a partner basis.

Over time a university could become more expert in this field and start providing complete virtualisation services for the majority of infrastructure reducing the onsite IT staff to networking and a team who remove dead PCs, box them up and unbox new working PCs.

I've spent weeks in gun-loving states and big cities like New York and never seen a single gun or eyed a stranger suspiciously. America does have more crime than us, but they also have far more poverty, bigger cities, gangs, drug problems etc too. Most people don't carry even though they're mostly legal over there. The whole thing about everybody being jumpy and accidental shootings etc just isn't reality.

As for problems in the UK - we DO have chavs carrying knives routinely. And it's incredibly unfair that a decent law-abiding person like myself isn't allowed to protect myself - even with a non-lethal preventative weapon like pepper spray.

As for guns being worse or more dangerous than knives, I don't really agree. Most people can't shoot for shit, and being accurate with a handgun is pretty difficult if you've ever tried it. IMO, knives are actually worse, and they're lethal within about 20 feet, which is the distance a knife-wielding attacker can close before you could even react.

I'm not saying that we should fully legalise guns in the UK, but I'm saying that we are WAY too afraid of them when we needn't be. And for personal defence, they are an effective tool. Perhaps we shouldn't legalise handguns, but we should allow people to carry tools to defend themselves.

It doesn't go by the relationship alone, it mainly goes by the fact that the are living together.

My brother's ex got done for this a few years ago. They (the investigators) became suspicious when two people, one male - one female, started claiming from the same address (They were both unemployed). Because they were claiming separately they were getting more money.

Apparently all the investigators did was talk to a few neighbours and get statements from them to confirm that they were a couple, and then confronted the two about it, who promptly caved and admitted it.

The key part there is them admitting it. If this guy wants to get away with this all he has to do is say that they have broken up and she hasn't found somewhere else to live yet. He will have to make up a second bedroom to make it look like she is sleeping in there if he does get anyone around to ask questions, but it's pretty rare for them to even bother unless the people involved have been reported/had previous trouble with the system.

They both ended up with a £500 fine and a conviction for fraud.

If we lived in a world where being unemployed was an inconvenience and restricted your options in life but did *not* mean undue hardship then it wouldn't be a big deal. The best people would get jobs that they're good at, those that provide no value to anyone would have enough money to live and be encouraged to take up pursuits that make them more employable (education, training, volunteering, stuff that provides value to their community vs. commercial interests)...

If we lived in such a society these problems (low skilled workers[1] being replaced) wouldn't matter, but because we live in a society where if you don't have a job you're pretty much up the shitter these problems will harm society as more and more things become more efficient.

A fun game I like to play is imagine everyone you work with or interact with every day, imagine how hard they work for the 8 hours a day they spend at work? Do they give 100%? 80%? 50%? From my experience(s) most people do not put in much effort at work; if every employed person put in 100% (as in, the maximum possible while remaining healthy) millions of jobs would be lost, because we make up for slack not by encouraging hard work but by hiring more people. Pick the hardest working person you know (maybe it's you!) and imagine that person x times to meet the same level of output your company has now, how reduced would the body count be? 10%? 50%? People reading this and people you know are employed because others are lazy!

I guess what I'm saying is you're right that Tesco shouldn't need to feel bad and the people being fired should know if they have some value to an employer they can get a new job and if they don't well tough shit, unfortunately we're not that advanced of a society yet and we still use jobs to support everything. If you're unemployed you're basically destined to need to suckle on a family member's teat or live like shit (based on state support).

Hopefully the new robot ran future will solve this problem, but if it doesn't... well, I fear for the people that are going to get phased out. Thankfully I have skills in places related to robots, so plain sailing for me. yippee. Thinking about a ""jobs for skilled people that want them and freedom to live without a job"" utopia is getting me all excited. So much would change if that happened, the world would become a fundamentally different place. No more uni ""because I need it to get a good job"", just people knowing that no matter what happens they can always rely on the state to support their dreams. Yeah that might not make sense *now*, but when supermarket workers disappear and waiters are reserved for £200/head restaurants it'll start to sound great (and I HOPE TO GOD plausible)

[1] I say low skilled in the sense that they're using skills that could be trained / learned relatively quickly, my world relies on the ""low skilled workers"" and I don't think any less of people work low skill jobs but it's a fact because most low skilled workers are employed for their body (as in, we need a person, not we need someone with skill x) they will be phased out relatively quickly

The crowd really goes for it but the editors immediately cut to Rich (whom, as an American, I am not a fan of honestly) and it is rather obvious that he is displeased by Stephen's ""low blow"" generalization.

Personally if I had to watch programmes interrupted by commercials every 5 minutes I'd throw my TV into the nearest swimming pool, then jump in after it.

Most people are not unhappy about it, they just like to moan, especially about paying for things. However, I wouldn't be surprised if the structure of the way we pay for the BBC changed in the next few years, because the way that people are watching TV has changed seismically in the last few years, with more people watching online and on tablets and with iplayer, which isn't really covered by current licensing.

true,vensolis,cnty-commonwealth,it's too hot where I am,"Quite apart from any question of which methodology to adopt in proper British tea-making, there are other significant aspects to tea you ought to consider.

1) Loose-leaf, or bagged tea?
2) What tea blend are you going for? This will affect how you ought to brew your tea, and (for purists) whether or not milk and/or sugar should also be added. For example, if you add milk or sugar to Earl Grey tea, you have been hideously tainted by Americanisms and stand in desperate need of a thorough re-education.
3) WHERE to buy tea from. Not all blends are created equal, and certainly there is a wide disparity between brands.

My tuppenny'orth on the above is that loose leaf tea is vastly superior to bagged tea. However, this requires you to use a proper teapot and strainer. Tea accessories may well comprise the substance of a whole other post. (Frankly, I'm quite surprised that nobody has created a subreddit for tea things...)

As for tea blends, this is a science unto itself. Sometimes, the name of the blend is itself a clue as to when it is best enjoyed: 'English Breakfast', for example. But of course, if you prefer something a little more exotic, Lapsang Souchong would work just as well. And if you're a total purist and don't like the 'neither here nor there' flavour of English Breakfast, there's always Darjeeling or Assam....

My personal ranking system for tea is roughly this:

'I don't know where you are getting your stats from. Cahill has two fewer goals than Torres (Not that that's vastly different lol). Moreover, a striker isn't always supposed to be a goal-scoring machine. There are plenty of strikers that play to involve other members of the team. Chelsea aren't playing through Torres and having him get all the chances, they are spreading the chances about. Hence why he isn't scoring.

Personally, I think this is a pretty stupid article. It offers no empirical analysis or data to actually support its conclusions, nor does it talk about the games in any detail. It mentions two heavily biased anecdotes to make an argument generalizing a player's performance over 12 games.

All I hear is a circle jerk of Torres sucks coming conveniently at a time when Chelsea as a whole team are doing crap. They lost to West Brom because they let in 2 goals to a team that is defensively solid. They didn't lose because of Torres, they lost because of defensive frailties. They lost to United because they got scored on thrice, not because Torres didn't score. They drew to us not because Torres didn't score, but because they lost out the midfield possession battle and let us score in the end.

Torres has scored 4 goals from 24 shots (12 on goal). Sturridge has scored one from 9 shots (5 on goal). Keep in mind, that Sturridge has made a few appearances (1 as a starter) as a sub (6), coming on when defenders have been worn down and he has a fresh pair of legs. Chelsea, as a team, have 24 goals this season, behind United (29) and Man City (25). Keep in mind that United have RvP, Rooney and Chicharito and City have Aguero, Tevez and Dzeko. Chelsea have Torres leading the line. The point I am trying to make is that Chelsea only have Torres, whereas the two clubs ahead of them have 2-3 world class strikers.

With 2-3 strikers, there are multiple different attacking (out and out striker) threats so one striker can find space because defenders can mistakenly double pursue the other striker(s). However, when there is 1 striker combined with 2-3 AMs, like Chelsea is playing, the defenders tend to mark the striker a lot more closely and leave more space for the AMs. This is why Lampard has scored three and Juan Mata has scored 4. This is why Sturridge had so many shots on goal (as the linked article stated). Torres drags defenders off through his presence and runs to give more space to the attacking midfielders and wingers. Chelsea is spreading the ball and goals around. The team isn't playing through Torres as some goal-scoring machine, they are integrating him into a team set-up.

Moreover, Chelsea has been playing terrible defensively. Up until the last three games, Chelsea's defense was one of the most solid in the league (perhaps even the most solid). However, since then on, they have let in 6 goals in the last three games. It's not a matter of Chelsea not scoring, it's that their defense has been shit. To put this in perspective, Chelsea had been scored on 7 times prior to the 6 goals in the past 3 games. Now that Chelsea is doing crap, everyone picks on the easiest person to attack because of his last season form and that happens to be Fernando Torres. I'm not his biggest fan, but the amount of crap he gets from people on here is ridiculous.

The Guardian comments are the left-wing Daily Mail.

Stating that the single market was a British idea is not going to win over the nationalists, the ECHR was also a British idea that that's not made it any more popular.

&gt;Some of the money also returns to London. 

It doesn't return in a cheque, it's returned in spending projects that we may or may not want. Citing net contributions is disingenuous, you should always use the gross figures in these situations.

&gt;Moreover, every UK household ""earns"" between £1,500 and £3,500 each year thanks to the single market, according to UK government estimates. 

Estimates are not facts. There are many estimates showing that we're losing money as a result of the EU, mostly due to not having a seat on the WTO. If we had remained with the old commonwealth agreement we would be trading much more cheaply with some of the fastest growing markets in the world. The Eurozone is a dead weight.

&gt;Irregularities in EU spending – around 3.5% is being questioned – are no bigger than those in national budgets. 

Unlike the EU these nation states are actually going through austerity to deal with their budget problems.

This season, he has 4 goals from 12 Premier League games, with an average of just 2 shots per game. This is despite having far better midfield support than we'll be able to provide him. Are those numbers really worth 15m, or 100k/wk in wages?

OK, there's a psychological aspect to it, but can we risk being the ones to rehabilitate him? We already have enough footballers lacking mental fortitude, why bring in one more, and that too for one of the most important deals we'll be making under Rodgers? Lots of people (rightly or wrongly) believe we're a quality striker away from challenging for the top 4 - is Torres really the only candidate to try and be that quality striker?

First time, I think it was four or five rounds of sending in declarations, phoning to confirm the declarations etc - but I didn't keep notes, and I might be exaggerating.

home (parents) are covered. The way I think I heard this is that the licensing authorities deliberately target students on the assumption that very few people know about this - which to me sounds like a probable crime in itself, assuming it's true.

It's not a fair comparison, but when you face Barca, you expect them to pass the ball and retain a good chunk of the possession. How do you break such a high-possession play? Ideally, you press hard, force an error, and you use that to your advantage to start a counterattack or begin linking your own passes.

But no one does it against Barca, and the teams that win more or less take the less glamorous tactic by ""parking the bus"" and waiting for exactly the right time to strike. Barca are predictable, but I'd be damned if it weren't effective as shit.

Even if teams are expecting Johnson and Enrique to cover each other and bomb forward down the left wing, it doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to be able to control them. I really feel like it could work for us.

You could drop Enrique, but then the left flank won't be nearly as dominating.  

You could drop Sterling, but he has been surprisingly consistent for his age and always looks to be a threat.  

No way anyone is going to drop Suarez.  

Now, you could arguably drop Wisdom and push Enrique back, allowing Johnson to go back to the right side.  That option probably makes the most sense, but Enrique looks a lot better to me as a winger than as a fullback.

true,davidsmeaton,lfc68,,"to be fair ... buying any striker is a risk. a lot of front men bang in the goals, switch clubs and go dry.

changing a player's environment changes everything. what torres did at liverpool was amazing. what if rogers could get him back to that form? torres putting away 20 goals a season, simply because of a change of environment.

i see your point and i know stats are important. but look how many strikers we've bought and sold. look how differently they play when at other clubs. even suarez, there's no guarantee that if we sold him in the summer he'd still perform as well as he is now.

change a player's environment and you change the player. i'd be willing to give torres another chance. he's got the skills and he's still young enough. he needs someone who can work him back into form.

and ... i'm just gonna say it ... i think playing for chelsea is a shit gig. they're a paycheque club and have none of the sense of belonging that liverpool have. liverpool is a family. i'm not surprised torres is miserable at stanford bridge.

He sees the beauty and wonder and shows such compassion for all living things (minus a few archenemies here and there) especially humans.  He sees how they can do such great things and how we are such a resilient race.

true,neonmantis,null,Derby International,"Indeed, people are habit forming and weed can certainly become a vice like anything else. But I would argue it is no more addictive than most other things and certainly not on the level of gambling. 

Jail for robbery I have no issue with, jail for smoking drugs I do. It serves no purpose. If it was legal maybe he would be able to afford it legally? If it was legal we could give it out to extreme users for free like switzerland does with heroin. People will commit crimes to feed their habits which causes more harm to society than simply supplying it to them and offering support and counselling. 

Weed isn't great for driving and should be treated the same as people who drive under the influence of alcohol. All drug use needs to be done responsibly and if you don't do that then I have no issue with appropriate sanctions and punishments. Some people will always be dicks, there isn't much we can do about it, but that doesn't mean everyone should be punished. 

We spend billions enforcing stupid drug laws, locking people up, investigating smugglers, ripping about cargo, employing entire units, dogs, support staff and the rest to achieve what? Stopping people getting high? Even if that was a worthy aim, which I don't believe it is, it doesn't and never has worked. It has demonstrably failed. Go to any city and you can buy whatever you want within 30 minutes. There is too much of a demand. Gangs exist to fill a power vacuum around incredible sums of money and rely on violence to enforce black markets, crime and loss of life is inevitable when drugs are illegal. I'd argue that gangs would rapidly reduce if drugs were legal. We could easily save a billion and then raise a billion in tax as well as keeping a tonne of people employed. And then maybe there would be less of this austerity rubbish that is costing people like you their jobs.
